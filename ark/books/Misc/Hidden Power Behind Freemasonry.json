Harmon R. Taylor, Grand Chaplain of the GRAND LODGE Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York (1983-1984). Dear Servant of God: Knowing that you desire to serve the Lord with all your heart, I share this letter with you. Perhaps you have been struggling w ith the same situation. On Nov. 22nd, I sent the facts contained in this le tter to all masonic bodies of which I am a member. I invite you to prayerfully read it. It will explain why I, as a Grand Chaplain of the Grand Lodge of Fr ee and Accepted Masons of the State of New York, am requesting a de mit from all bodies of the masonic fraternity. There is much more that I could share with you. I would be happy to share more if it will help you in the Lord's service. Many have asked me if FREEMASONRY is a religion. I have always responded, \"No.\" Others have told me it is a religi on. Study has revealed the fact that learned writers in the fraternity say MASONRY IS A RELIGION. The Lord Jesus Christ said: \"hi the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word is established\" (Matt. 18:16). In order to be brief, I will quote only four masonic authorities that mason ry is a religion. ALBERT MACKEY, one of the best known masonic author ities, wrote in A LEXICON OF FREEMASONRY (pg. 402): \"The religion, then, masonry, is pure theism . ALBERT PIKE, the most important of all American mas onic authorities, wrote in MORALS AND DOGMA (pg. 213-214): \"Every masonic lodge is a temple of religion, and its teachings are instruc tions in religion ... this is true religion "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Page 6 revealed to the ancient patriarchs,' which masonry has taught for centuries, and which it will continue to teach as l ong as time endures.\" J. S. M. WARD, a masonic authority who has written several important books on masonry, wrote in his book: FREEMASONRY: IT'S AIMS & IDEALS. (pg. 185): \"I consider freemasonry is a significant organized school of mysticism to be entitled to be called a r eligion.\" He continues on page 187: \"Freemasonry ... taught that each man can, by himself, work out his own conception of god and thereby achieve salva tion.\" It holds that there are many paths that lead to the throne of the all-loving Father which all start from a common source. Freemasonry believe s, according to Ward, \"that though these paths appear to branch off in va rious directions, yet they all reach the same ultimate goal, and that to some men one path is better and to others, another.\" FRANK C. HIGGINS, a high mason, wrote in ANCIENT FREEMASONRY . (pg. 10): \"fit is true the freemasonry is the parent of all religion.\" These masonic witnesses all agree in their doctrine that masonry is, indeed, a religion. It is necessary now to ascertai n whether masonry is a true religion or a false religion. In an article en titled, How to Recognize a False Religion (Faith for the Family, Nov/Dec 1974), a prominent Christian leader wrote: \"All false religions, however, have some things in common. Here are the three simplest tests by which any religion should b e judged; FIRST, what is its attitude towards the Bible? SECOND, any religious teaching should be judged by this question: 'What is its attitude towards Jesus Christ?' FINALLY, in judging any religious system, we should ask: 'What is its attitude toward the blood of Jesus Christ.'\" Page 7 According to these three tests, masonry is a false religion manifesting a satanic attitude towards the Bible, the Deity of Je sus Christ, and the blood atonement of Jesus Christ. In order to establish th is charge, keep in mind the word of Christ, \"In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.\" Please consider now the testimony of masonic authorities which reveals masonry's satanic attitud e towards the Bible, the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Deity of Jesus Christ, and the vicarious atonement for the sins of mankind by the shedding of Christ's blood on the cross. JOSEPH FORD NEWTON, a famous masonic authority and writer, in an article entitled: THE BIBLE AND FREEMASONRY, wrote : \"The Bible so rich in symbolism is itself a symbol ... thus, by the very honor which masonry pays the Bible, it teaches us to revere eve ry book of faith in which men find help for today and hope for tomorrow , joining hands with the Hindu, as he makes covenant with God upon the b ook that he loves best.\" ALBERT PIKE, in MORALS & DOGMA, (pg. 718) wrote: \"Masonry propagates no creed except it's own simple sublime one,' that of universal religion, taught by nature and reason. One who has been truly \"born-again\" (born from abov e), can see that the above statement from masonry totally rejects the cr ucial doctrine of an infallible, God-breathed, inerrant Bible. According to the SECOND TEST, masonry is a false re ligion because it totally rejects the crucial doctrine of the Deity o f the Lord Jesus Christ. J. D. BUCK, M.D., another masonic writer of importa nce, in his book SYMBOLISM OF MYSTIC MASONRY , wrote (pg. 57): \"In the early church as in the secret doctrine, there was not one Christ for the world but a potential Christ in every man. Theologians first made a fetish of the impersonal, omnipresent divinity,' and then tore th e 'Christ Page 8 is God' from the hearts of all humanity in order to Deify Jesus; that they might have a God-Man particularly their own.\" According to the THIRD TEST, masonry is a false rel igion because masonry dogmatically refuses the doctrine of salvat ion from the penalty of sin by faith in the vicarious atonement of Christ's shed blood on the cross. THOMAS MILTON STEWART, another masonic author, in his book SYMBOLIC TEACHING ON MASONRY AND ITS MESSAGE to support his doctrine, quoted favorably an apostate Episcopa l minister on pg. 177: 'Did Jesus count Himself conceive of Himself as a p roprietary sacrifice and of His work an expiation? The only answer possi ble is clearly, He did not ... He does not call Himself the world's priest, or the world's victim.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Salvation by faith in the vicarious atonement are n ot \"ignorant perversions of the original doctrines\" as masonry teaches, but are vital ingredients of the glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the power o f God unto salvation to everyone who believes. THEREFORE, masonry fails all three tests! It manifests a satanic attitude towards the Bible, the Deity of Christ, and the vicarious atonement. In addition to failing these t ests, there is much more proof that masonry is a false religion For instance, HENRY C. CLAUSEN, 33 o , Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council 33 o , Mother Council of the World, in the NEW AGE , November, 1970 (pg. 4) wrote regarding masonry: \"It is dedicated to bringing about the Fatherhood of God, the Brothe rhood of Man, and making better men in a better world.\" The doctrine of the Fatherhood of God and the Broth erhood of Man is not found in the Bible. It is a doctrine taught consist ently by apostates. Also, the Bible makes it crystal clear that no organizati on, masonry included, can make better men. ONLY GOD CAN MAKE BETTER MEN! Page 9 According to a masonic creed, found in the Masonic bible, masonry teaches that \"character determines destiny.\" The teaching that character determines destiny is a false doctrine of the Arch Deceiver of men's souls. The Bible says: \"There is none that doeth good, \"and \"For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of your selves; it is a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast\" (Eph. 2:8). Masonry is anti-Christian in its teachings. For exa mple, J. M. WARD, in FREEMASONRY - ITS AIMS AND IDEALS , wrote on (pg. 187): \"I boldly aver that freemasonry is a religion, yet it no way conflicts with any other religion, unless that religion holds that no one ou tside its portals can be saved.\" Ward in his statement, reveals the fact that masonr y has no conflict with any apostate religion on the face of the earth, but that it is in conflict with Christianity. The Bible says: 'Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heave n, given among men, whereby we MUST be saved\" (Acts 4:12 ). The Bible makes it clear that there is no other way to salvation except through J esus Christ. A prominent college president said of masonry: \"It is a Luciferean religion. We are fully aware of its diabolical orig in and purpose. I believe"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"that any born-again Christian, when the facts from the lips of masonic writers themselves are presented showing that mason ry is a religion and is the worship of Satan, will immediately withdraw.\" To this I must add my hearty agreement! The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, the on ly True and Living God, has clearly commanded Christians: \"Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers, and swear not at all, an d have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather r eprove them\" ( 2 Cor. 6:14). CHARLES FINNEY, the famed evangelist who God used to bring revival to America in the 1930's, in his book, FREEMASONRY (pg. 115) wrote: \"Surely, if masons really Page 10 understood what Masonry is, as it is delineated in these books, no Christian Mason would think himself to remain at li berty another day as a member of the fraternity. It is as plain as possibl e that a man knowing what it is, and embracing it in his heart, cannot b e a Christian man. To say he is is to disbelieve the very nature of Chris tianity.\" For me, the signs of the time compared with prophet ic Scripture, make it apparent that we are living in the last days prior to the Rapture of the Church. (Here is another apparently sincere man, wh o has been taken in by Jewish propaganda concerning the Rapture - ED). Satan is hard at work trying to hinder believer's spiritual growth, as we ll as trying to keep the unsaved from entering God's family. Freemasonry, I have come to believe, is one of Satan's master deceptions. Many ministers , elders, deacons, trustees, and Sunday School teachers belong to this cult. Today, my membership ends! Today a new ministry begins! There is a tremendous need to scrutinize the cultic nature of Freemasonry in view of the massive infiltration of its effects on the working body of the church. It should be exposed to the True Light - Jesus Christ. Love in Christ, SIGNED - Howard R. Taylor. For anyone interested in contacting Brother Taylor, his address is: P.O.

The following information comes from an article tit led: THROUGH THE FIRES OF MOLECH , by WILLIAM J. SCHNOEBELEN. For further information contact: FREE THE MASONS MINISTRIES, P.O. Box 1077, Issaquah, WA 98027. An earnest question is asked of us who minister to the Masons. \"So if Masonry is un-Christian, what about the youth order s of Masonry? Are they so bad?\" In this increasingly carnal world ord er, are there good places one can send their son or daughter for fun and fell owship with the assurance that they will only be exposed to wholeso me influences? What about the Masonic orders for youth - the ORDER OF DEMOLAY? THE RAINBOW GIRLS? JOB'S DAUGHTERS? Are these innocent enough? This assumption neglects central principles found in the Holy Bible - the very Bible which is found reposing on t he. alters of Masonry. The first question is one of spiritual authority. S urely no Christian parents needs to be reminded of the responsibility they hav e for the precious young souls God has entrusted to them. The Bible is full of admonitions to carefully train one's child. \"And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by th e way, and when though liest down, and when thou riseth up\" (Deut. 11:19). And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord\" (Eph. 6:4). Conversely, there are dire spiritual warnings for t hose who either fail to teach their children or who lead them in error-fill ed teachings: "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Page 12 \"But whoso shall offend one of these little ones wh ich believe in me (Christ), it is better for him that a millstone wer e hanged about his neck, and that he be drowned in the depths of the sea\" (Matt. 18:6). Thus God has given Christian parents ultimate spiri tual authority, or headship over their children. Even if the child has not yet received eternal life, he or she is protected under the covenant of the parent's commitment to Jesus Christ to an incredible extent. The Lord h as placed a strong hedge of protection around Christian families. \"Hast thou (God) not made a hedge about him, and ab out his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast ble ssed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land\" (Job 1:10). What does all this have to do with Masonic youth or ders? It is the same question of leadership. Masonry is a false religiou s system, and its god is not the Biblical God. Therefore, temples of Freemas onry are temples of a false god; and Freemasons are, knowingly or not, pr iests of a false, Baalish system. Please bear in mind that this is a spiritual princi ple and that it has little to do with the appearances or even the philosophies of these youth groups. None of these groups are allowed to meet without th e presence of a MASTER MASON. They function solely under the charte r of Masonic authority! They are also designed to draw young peo ple into the adult orders, which means that upon being initiated the y oung man or woman is spirithe ly \"adopted\" into the Masonic family, even though they are not actually Masons. Even the Christian youth, who has been adopted into God's family (Rom. 8:15-17 ) comes under this spiritual authority of Masonry a s well when he joins the order. This cannot help but make them \"do uble-minded\" (James 1:5-8) at an already difficult phase of their lives . No matter how apparently \"innocent\" the ceremonies and teachings of these youth orders are, they function under Page 13"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"the shadow of an anti-Christian spiritual power whi ch the Master Mason brings with him. No parent would knowingly permit their son or daugh ter to attend a coven of witches; and yet the same spiritual principality ( Eph. 6:12 ) which presides over witchcraft, ALSO presides over Masoni c ceremonies - the false god of magic and ancient pagan fertility cult s from which Masonry proudly claims descent! 1 FUELING THE FIRES? Thus the youth is walking innocently into a spiritu al minefield, without warning, when they enter a Masonic youth order. The y stand in Satan's territory and have opened a doorway in their lives to him to begin to corrode their very souls. They have broken down the hedge which God has placed around them! ( Eccl. 19:8 ). Not only that! At the very age when powerful emotio nal drives are running at peak, they are surrendering themselves t o a spiritual power which is engineered to provoke lust! The very eleme nts and symbols of Masonry, even as in witchcraft, are sexual in spiri tual content. A young person who is receiving sound instruction at home w ould be having it subtly undermined by submitting to the headship of Masonic authority! Masonry exalts human sexuality in a disguised way. The square and compass symbols actually represent the male and fem ale reproductive organs. The \"point within the circle\" and the twin pillars are disguised forms of ancient talismans of paganism designed to invoke lust. 2 Notes:- 1 (See Albert Pike's Morals And Dogma, pp. 730-732; Albert Mackey's 33 o , Encyclopedia Of Freemasonry , pp. 560, 573 2 Albert Mackey 33 o , Encyclopedia Of Freemasonry, pp. 560, 573; and Symbolism In Freemasonry, pp. 352-53). Page 14"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Thus, while teaching pious principles on the surfac e, these orders only serve to pour fuel on the already smoldering fires of adolescent emotion, and the God-given rights of the Christian parents a re diluted by the very real authority of a strange god who appeals to all that is carnal in a young person. WHERE IS CHRIST? The desire to be \"something special,\" and to \"Lord it over others\" is enhanced by these groups, which bestows impressive, high sounding titles upon the officers (\"Honored Queen,\" etc.,) and dres s them up in all the pomp of royalty! Crowns and scepters, satin robes a nd chains of office: these all serve to glorify the egos of the young pe ople instead of conforming them to the humble image of Christ (See Phil. 2:5-9; Rom. 12:1,2). Certainly these orders make a show of teaching \"rel igion,\" but religion is not what our youth need. They need the Gospel of Gr ace! Subtly but completely, a doctrine of salvation by works and la bor is taught in these orders, contrary to Scripture. The secrecy and elit ism of these groups is both uncharitable and forbidden by Jesus Christ Him self, who forbade the taking of oaths (Matt. 5:34-37 ). True Christian love does not exclude, but rather embraces \"whosoever will may come.\" THERE ARE DEEPER CONCERNS! Listen to the Prophet Jeremiah: \"And they built the high places of Baal, which are the valley of the son of Himnon, to cause their sons and daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; whi ch I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin\" (Jer. 32:35). "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" Page 15 Elsewhere God specifically commands: \"Thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God. I lam the Lord\" (Lev. 18:22; 20:1-5). Now what is being spoken of was a particularly vile form of child sacrifice. Molech was a god of the Ammorites, an id ol made of metal and heated up by flames from within. The child was plac ed in the idol's red- hot arms and one hesitates to even imagine the resu lts. 3 The Hebrews were forbidden by God to do this. Yet, unthinkable as it sounds, the Israelites persi stently fell into this precise sort of idolatry. They were so beguiled by the exquisite sounding promises of the priests of Baal and Molech that the y willingly passed their sweet children through the fires; in spite of the r epeated warnings of the prophets. Even the wise Solomon, one of the patron saints of Masonry, built an altar to this god ( 1 Kings 11:1-8 ). Horrifying as this may seem, in Masonry the same th ing is happening to the young person on a spiritual level! The fires of Molech only consumed the bodies of those innocent children; the spiritua l fires of the Masonic order corrodes the very souls of our "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Notes:- 3. Eerdman's Handbook of the Bible, p.178. Page 16 youth! The \"intention rites\" which they put these y oung people through are unhallowed conflagrations which sear their cons ciences with a red-hot iron. In our society today, there are enough \"fires\" thro ugh which our children must walk: drugs, sex, occult movies, and heavy met al music. Most of these the child chooses for himself, however, unkno wingly. But in the Masonic youth orders, the young person i s often urged to join with the blessings of the parents. The very virtuou s appearance of these Orders is what makes them the more dangerous. These teens are drinking spiritual poison in unlabled bottles! They are comi ng under an un- Christian spiritual power which conflicts with the power of God and can only cause confusion to the teen. Solomon wrote that \"He that troubleth his own house , shall in inherit the wind\" ( Prov. 11:29 ); and his life was tragic proof of that. His idola try fractured the kingdom of Israel, and he did indeed \"inherit the wind.\" We are troubling our own house when we offer our ch ildren these pagan societies. We are creating subtle discord in their young hearts when we let them sit, week after week, under the shadow of Maso nry, and yet expect them to be upright. WHAT CAN BE DONE? Let us remember the \"curse of the millstone,\" which Jesus said in Matthew 18:6 , should be tied around the necks of those who lead children astray and try to pass our adolescents through more fires than our culture already subjects them to. It is the unseen trap which is the most deadly, and their very souls are at stake. If you are allowing your young people to par take in these societies, you need to get them out immediately! If you, yours elf, are involved, you need"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" Page 17 to renounce them and repent before God! Only then w ill you have full victory which Jesus can bring. It is important to remember, that as you draw your children from these \"fires,\" they will also need to repent in prayer fo r their involvement. They can do this by asking a loving Savior to wash them clean with His blood and take the spiritual debris out of their lives! H e is indeed 'faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrig hteousness\" (1 John 1:19). 3 - INTRODUCTION TO THE MASONIC PROBLEM In John 7:4 we read: \"For there is no man that doeth anything i n secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thoug h doest these things, show thyself to the world.\" In Luke 8:17 we read: \"For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest (rendered apparent or made known); neither anything hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.\" The subject which we are about to discuss in detail is one which I have avoided for a long time. But because of the serious ness of its nature and the profound danger it presents to white Christians in particular, it is something I MUST face even though its revelation ma y bring personal danger and many may be offended. I am praying that this book will engender more \"lig ht\" than it does \"heat.\" I do not ask that you agree with my conclusions, so me of which will be rather startling in nature. I do ask that you are f air enough with yourself, to Page 18 read this book to the end, before you consign it to the waste basket. Please do not be one of those smug persons who say by thei r actions: \"Don't"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"bother me with the truth, I have already made up my mind!\" It is very possible, that before I have finished with this sub ject 0 f FREEMASONRY, I will have to say with the Apostle Paul: \"Am I to become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?\" (Gal. 4:16). What is this \"super-sensitive\" issue we will discus s, that might cause this adverse reaction? No, we will not be discussing JUD AISM, although this has also become a \"No! No!\" in modern life. In the pages which follow, I will attempt to describe a dangerous phenomenon kno wn as FREEMASONRY! We will look into what it is, how it b egan, discuss its major purposes and then see the startling story of who is behind it! To gain these answers, we will go to a number of so urces, including writers who have been high ranking Masons who, when they learned the truth and found out the nature of the organization they had joined, had the courage to get out and expose it! We will examine statements made by both the Lodge a nd its opponents. I ask that God will give us enlightenment, through Hi s Word, the Bible, so that we may learn the truth, not what men would lik e to believe. In Ecclesiastes 12:1, we read: \"For God shall bring every work into judgment, with EVERY SECRET THING, whether it be go od or evil.\" A great American educator of an earlier day once sa id: \"It must be a bad issue which cannot bear discussion. Truth always se eks the light.\" Jesus said in John 3:19 - \"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, BECAUSE THEIR DEEDS ARE EVIL.\" Page 19 There you have it! It would seem from this, that most things which are done in secret are evil. In Ephesians 5:12 we read: \"For it is a shame to speak of those thin gs which are done of them in secret.\" We are going to probe deeply into one of the most s ecret of all secrets - a secret which has and still does involve millions of men and which exerts untold control over the lives of all Americans."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"What is this hidden force called FREEMASONRY? To millions of members, in what is sometimes called the Blue Lodge, which makes up the lower ranks of FREEMASONRY, Free masonry is a philanthropic, benevolent, fraternal order of men, who have banded together under the Christian banner of \"world-broth erhood\" for a common cause. Often, however, hidden orders in society, have had ulterior motives, not known to the \"rank and file\" members. Only the \"eli te\" in the \"upper echelons\" are allowed to see the secret plans. It may interest you to know that most of the lower orders of Freemasonry, do not realize their is a close connection between Masonry and anti-Christ Zionism, but this is an established fact of history which I will seek to prove to you. The Talmudic (Jewish holy book) formulas employed b y Freemasonry; the Jewish traditions which run through masonic cer emonies, all point to a Jewish origin, or to the work of Jewish connivers i n the lodge. Behind the Zionists urge to rebuild Solomon's temple, lies a v irulent hatred of Christ and all things Christian and is found in the depths of Jewish secret societies. We should remember, that the people of the Bible, i n both the Old and New Testament eras, those who most Page 20 translations of the Bible call JEWS, should actuall y be called JUDEANS, since there were no people in the world known as JE WS, until about 742 B.C., nearly 1200 years after the time of Abraham, where we find them fighting against Israel. Since the term JEW, in the Bible, has no religious connotation and simply refers to those people who were living in the area of Palestine called JUDEA and which were made up of many races, and rel igions, therefore they should be properly referred to as JUDAHITES or JUDEANS, rather than JEWS. The religion of the modern people we call JEWS, was not the Hebrewism of Moses and the Old Testament prophets, but was a new, Cabalistic (occult) religion the Judeans brought back with the m when a few returned"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"from Babylonian captivity about 536 B.C. Today, thi s religion is more accurately known as TALMUDIC JUDAISM. At the time of Christ, the Talmudic scholars were called PHARISEES. Many of these were Edomites who were related to Abraham through his gr andson Esau (see John 8:33). While these sat in \"Moses' seat\" of authority (Matt. 23:2), they had already overthrown the true Hebrew religion, by what Jesus called \"the traditions of men \" (Matt. 15:6, 9). These were the enemies of God and God's true Israel and were the ones with whom our Lord had a constant running battle wh ile He was here on earth. These were the ones who ultimately persuaded the Israelite people to kill their own Messiah ( John 1:11). One of the tenets of their plot was to return to Je rusalem from Babylon, rebuild Solomon's temple and from there establish c ontrol of the world. The above was taken from a discourse by Msg. George Dillion, given in Edinburgh, Scotland, in October 1884. The object of his message was Page 21 to give a clear outline of the secret, atheistic or ganization, that was to aid the JUDEANS in their worldwide plot. In spite of the fact that God had given repeated wa rnings to the Hebrew people through His prophets, they constantly refuse to follow His plans. God permitted them to kill His Son, Jesus Christ, a nd thus restore the hope of salvation to mankind \"For by His (Christ's) stri pes are we healed\" (Isa. 53:5). When the JUDAHITES turned their backs on God , the Kingdom was taken away from them and given to another natio n (Israel), (see Matt. 21:43 ). On account of their racial pride, the people who ca lled themselves JEWS, refused to accept the idea of a kingdom higher than their national life and refused to believe that anyone but they could enter this kingdom. When Christ was murdered on Mt. Calvary, at the instigat ion of the national leadersfailey determined to work against God and Hi s purpose and impose their rule on all peoples everywhere. This has been their purpose ever since and they make very little attempt to hide it.

First by oppos ing the coming of our Lord, they oppose the only means by which mankind c an come into a right relationship with God.

Thus the people whose religion is found in TALMUDISM place themselves in direct opposition to the world order proclaimed by Jesus Christ.

The Apostle Paul, speaking of men such as these sai d: \"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools\" (Romans 1:22). FREEMASONRY was in operation in Europe as early as 1527, where it was set up by JUDAISM as a secret society, or group of societies, in which its naturalism and anti-supernaturalism was k ept secret and camouflaged.

It appeared in print in November 1980, and was auth orized by the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of A.F. & A.M. of the C ommonwealth of Virginia. It has subsequent printings in 1982, 1984 , and 1986 and was accepted by the Supreme Council, 33 o Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction, USA (Mother Supreme Co uncil of the World). On other words, what you are about to read, comes right \"from the horse's mouth.\" In this chapter, you will discover what Mas ons say about themselves. In following chapters, we will discover what MASONRY is really all about. FREEMASONRY - WHAT IS IT? Freemasonry means many things to many people. This is true not only of the person who is not a Mason, but applies to Mason s themselves. Some of those who have been members of the Masonic Craft for many years are afraid to mention even the things which almost ever yone knows about the fraternity. Others among us are convinced that FREE MASONRY is a secret society and that they, as members, are forbi dden to talk about it to others whom they do not know to be Masons. Most of this is far from the truth and a word of explanation concerning this Fra ternal organization may not be amiss. FREEMASONRY IS A FRATERNITY. (Kee p in mind that this is what FREEMASONIC LEADERS SAY Masonry i s all about). FREEMASONRY is the oldest, and by far, the largest fraternal order in the world. Its lodges stretch around the globe and, like the British Empire, it might well be said that the sun never sets on th e Masonic Lodge. Fraternity means an association of friends and brot hers, and that is exactly"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Page 25 what Freemasonry is - a society of friends and brot hers. It is not a benefit society in the sense that one becomes a member of i t because of the insurance benefits which he may receive or which ma y insure to his family at his death. It is not an eleemosynary institution (a charitable institution), founded to collect and disburse charity or founded on the giving of alms. It is not a secret society in that its Temples are openly marked and almost everyone in the community knows where they are loca ted. The Grand Lodge publishes a list of the members of every lodg e in Virginia. Many of the lodges have individual bulletins which carry th e names of officers and of members as well. Thus it is, ii' the strictest s ense of the world, a society with secrets and these are limited to its obligatio n, its modes of recognition, and is the Tiller which guards the Lod ge from intrusion. FREEMASONRY'S MEMBERSHIP Membership, because it is a fraternity, is limited to men. He who would become a member must meet certain recognized requir ements - high standards of character and reputation. It does not require that its members subscribe to any particular creed, or belong to any particular church. Church membership does not keep one out of or secur e him admission into any Masonic Lodge. The profession of a belief in Go d and in a future life are the sole religious requirements. No one is excluded because of his membership in a p articular church. There are, however, a few denominations which do no t allow their members to become Masons, in some instances the mis taken impression had gone abroad that Freemasonry refuses admission to those who are members of certain denominations. It is the the chu rch, rather than Freemasonry, that denies that membership. Page 26 HOW DOES ONE BECOME A FREEMASON? Many men do not understand the process of acquiring membership in a Masonic Lodge. No one is ever invited to become a M ason or to join a Lodge. Though all morally good men would be welcome d in any Masonic Lodge, the man himself must first ask some Mason ab out becoming a"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"member. Once he has done so, the requested Mason wi ll secure an application blank, called by our Lodges a petition, and he has taken the first step. He must have two Masons who know him to sign his petition, vouching for his character and his qualifications. He must also receive the unanimous ballot of the members of the Lodge to whi ch he applies for the degrees, who are present when his petition is voted on. Having passed this ballot, the candidate receives h is first of three degrees which make up the symbolism of the Craft Lodge. Thi s is designated The Degrees of Entered Apprentice. The second degree is designated The Degree of Fellow Craft, and the third degree is the Degree of Master Mason. Each degree is a separate entity and one is always an Entered Apprentice when he sits in a lodge on the First Deg ree of Masonry, no matter what his Masonic status may be. Each of thes e degrees has certain rights and privileges but all of the rights and pri vileges are attained only after the degree is received. After he has received each of the degrees, the cand idate must commit to memory a catechism covering the degree received. He must be examined in open Lodge and prove his right to be advanced th ereby. This serves a useful purpose, t for it assures the Fraternity that each will know h imself to be a Mason and be able to recognize others of the C raft by their manner of speaking. He will be enabled by such knowledge to v isit other Lodges where he is not known and must be examined to prove his right to be admitted. Page 27 FREEMASONRY'S ORIGIN Freemasonry is ancient, having existed in some form for so long that many serious students have differed as to the time and p lace of its origin. There is evidence of a basic type of craft association wh ich antedate the Christian era. It survived various transitions whic h took place. during the Middle Ages. It was during this period that the wor d FREE was prefixed to the word MASON, because these builders were one of the very few classes of persons allowed to travel from country t o country and to practice the builder's art wheresoever they went. I t was these companies of Masons who constructed the beautiful cathedrals and other stately structures which dot the plains of Europe and the E nglish countryside. These men differed in the main from others of the w orking crafts because they, possessing knowledge and skills not found els ewhere, were free men rather than bond servants."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Until the Sixteenth Century Masons were strictly an operative craft, bound together by the close ties found in the constructiv e guilds of the day. Early in the Seventeenth Century, men of prominence were admitted, not as craftsmen, for they were not skilled in the builder s art, but rather as patrons. Gradually these men came to be known as \"A CCEPTED MASONS.\" Thus, by the time the Seventeenth Century came to its end these ACCEPTED or SPECULATIVE MASONS were predomina te in many of the older Lodges of Freemasonry. Today the Masonic Lodge is termed SPECULATIVE because its emphasis is on the m oral philosophy which is its foundation, rather than the operative art of the Sixteenth and earlier centuries. The tools of the stonemason are used to symbolize moral virtues rather than build cathedrals. THE GRAND LODGE SYSTEM On June 24, 1717, St. John the Baptist Day, the mem bers of four old Lodges in London, met together in Grand Page 28 ASSEMBLY TO FORM THE GRAND LODGE of England. That t his was a SPECULATIVE LODGE is evidenced by the electio n of one styled ANTHONY SAYER, GENTLEMAN as Grand Master. All moder n Freemasonry traces its beginning under the Grand Lo dge system of Government. FREEMASONS came to America about the third decade o f the Eighteenth Century when Lodges were established in New York, P ennsylvania, Massachusetts, Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia . American Freemasons can take pride in the part which members of this Fraternity have played in the history of this country. Many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were Masons and the same statement is true of those who signed the Constitution of the United States. Famous men such as George Washington , Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere, Lafayette, James Monroe and others whose names awaken memories of the founders of our country. Sin ce our country's beginning, thirteen Presidents have been Masons. Masons have also won laurels in other fields of end eavor and we find them prominent in government, in science, in sports , in entertainment, and finally in man's newest field, that of space explor ation with Wally Schirra, Gordon Cooper, Virgil Grissom, and \"Buz\" Aidrin, al l bound by the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"mystic tie of Freemasonry. FREEMASONRY - WHAT IS IT It has a different connotation in different situati ons. Someone has written that Freemasonry is honesty in business; that it is fairness in work; courtesy in society; compassion for the sick and un fortunate; forgiveness for the penitent; love for our fellow man and rever ence for God. Yes it is all of these, but it is more, for Freemas onry is a philosophy to live by, the shadow of a mighty rock in a weary land.

THEN YOU BE THE JUDGE AS TO WHETHER IT I S GOOD FOR AMERICA OR NOT! 5 - A FORMER HIGH RANKING MASON LOOKS AT FREEMASONIC SYMBOLISM From here on, we will get into the heart of FREEMAS ONRY, and there will be many of the Masonic members of the lower or ders who will be furious by what they will believe to be a senseless expose of their Lodge and a revelation of its secrets. But the high ranki ng Mason who reads this, although he will be furious over it, will recognize the truth, even though he refuses to admit it. If I reach only one member of FREEMASONRY with the truth, the effort taken to write this book will be worth it. It is not written as a means of hurting any good person, but to expose a very present danger to those of us who are White Christi ans who love our country. This chapter will come from a brochure I r eceived from J. Edward Decker, Jr., who works with an organization called FREE THE MASONS MINISTRIES. You can contact him at P.O. Box 1077, Issaquah, WA 98027. He would be most interested in corresponding with members of the Masonic Lodge, who may be concerned with what they have seen happen within their Lodge."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The question of the Christian stand regarding Freem asonry seems to confront our ministry at every turn Page 30 lately, because I have seen the exact parallels of the Masonic legends and rituals carried throughout the \"mysteries\" of Mormo nism and have studied deeply into Masonic origins, purposes and doctrines . In doing so, I have had to come to grips with the s ad fact that the esoteric doctrines of Freemasonry separate it, just as unequ ivocally as do those of Mormonism, from the Christian theology. This holds true of every branch of Masonry, from the Shriners to the Blue Lodge, th e Eastern Star, the Demolay, Job's Daughters and the Rainbow Girls! It holds true for the Scottish rite or the York rite! I realize this will cause offense to many Masons, a nd for that I am truly sorry. But I would rather that the Masons be offend ed at me and then be resorted to true fellowship with Jesus Christ than to remain silent any longer. This word of warning is not to the Masonic Fraterni ty at large, but to those Masons who claim to be both Masons and Christians. A recent newspaper insert, called FREEMASONRY - A WAY OF LIFE ! appeared in many metropolitan areas. It pictured Fr eemasonry as a family- centered, fraternal, benevolent organization, as \"A merican as apple pie!\" Not only does this article demonstrate the strength of Freemasonry among our political leaders (Both past and present), but makes much of its use of the Holy Bible and its foundational belief in God. Masonry has a strong representation in Christian denominations throughou t the world. In many churches we visit, we find Masons involved as deaco ns, elders, board members, and even pastors. Their claim and the claim of every Mason to the out side world is that Masonry and Christianity are totally compatible. Th ey tell me that religion is the experience of relating to God, and Masonry t he experience of relating to Page 31"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"mankind. While separate, they can and do naturally coexist. The article mentioned above explains its \"religious \" position this way. Masonry is NOT a religion in any sense of the word, yet it is religious. Church membership is not a requirement, yet membership in ANY is no bar to admission. There is nothing in the requireme nts of Masonry to prevent a Catholic, a Mohammedan, a Jew, a Buddhist , a Protestant, a Mormon, or any member of any religion from becoming a member. On the surface, this might seem quite reasonable. I find no offense in being involved in social, civic and benevolent acti vities with people of other religious backgrounds But when it comes to my own personal worship of God , and His revelation to me of His Word, there are some very clear guidel ines. If Freemasonry is truly what it professes publicly, then \"Bravo!\" It is a welcomed 'fellowship! If it is being deceptive, the n it should be exposed. It is that simple. Let's see what Masonry TRULY teaches within its clo sed doors, through its own published documents. No \"anti-Masonic\" publ ications will be cited in explaining the TRUE Masonic theological po sition. The key document from which I quote is the most rea dily available and universally approved doctrinal book of Freemasonry, MORALS AND DOGMA OF THE ANCIENT AND ACCEPTED SCOTTISH RITE OF FREEMASONRY, by Albert Pike, Grand Commander (1859-1891). Its title page states that it was prepared for the \"Supreme Council of the 33 o and Published by its Authority.\" Originally published in 1871, I will use the 1966 edition. Except where other sources are no ted, I cite page numbers only when using this work. Emphasis within parenthesis are my own.

MASONRY CONCEALS ITS TRUTHS \"Masonry, like all the religions, all the Mysteries , hermeticism and Alchemy, CONCEALS its secrets from all except the A depts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misre presentations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve to be misled; to conceal Truth, which it call Light, from them, and to draw them aw ay from it.

That is a Priesthood that can be held by only One person and that one person is clearly defined in Scripture as Jesus Christ. In chapters seven and eight of the book of Hebrews, we are told that it was ANOTHER Priest who would be raised up, not a group of priests! This Priest would be our HIGH PRIEST and would be able t o save to the uttermost! He would have \"endless life!\" The holder of this Priesthood would be \"holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens\" ( Heb. 7:26 ) . This is Jesus Christ, our Holy Lord and God! This Masonic ritual takes Christ's Holy Priesthood from Him, and the Grand Pontiff boldly puts it upon his own breast.

I believe you will find it an eye- opener. When the average American thinks of Masonry, the th oughts are of Children's Burn Centers and Hospitals, and the Shri ne Circus, where handicapped children are often carried to the front row seats in the strong arms of weeping men who are wearing the red Fezes o f their fraternity. Rarely do we see a parade without these same Shrine rs driving up and down the parade route in their little cars and moto rcycles, dressed in clothes out of the Arabian nights, bringing laughte r to the children lined up along the way. On more serious occasions, such as the laying of pu blic building cornerstones, or at a funeral service of a Lodge me mbers, these same men, dressed in somber attire, wearing their ornate sash es, medallioned chains of office and ceremonial aprons, will perform with solemn dignity the rites"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"handed down through the centuries of their secret r itual -\"Good men,\" they say, \"becoming better!\" Yet, once you get past the good-old-boy fraternal a ct, the funny hats of the Shriners and the sheltered reputation of the local Blue Lodge Masonic groups, there is something beyond the colorful mask , an aura of mystery, power and intrigue, complete with under oaths of fa lse gods, blood oaths, conspiracy and back room politics. The Fez itself, is an example of the double meaning behind most of Freemasonry's facade. Worn and even carried to the grave with pompous dignity, the history of the Fez is barbaric and ant i-Christian. In the early 8th Century, Page 50 Muslim hordes overran the Moroccan city of Fez, sho uting: \"There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his prophet. There they butchered almost 50,000 Christian men, women and children, all in th e name of Allah, the same demon god to whom the Shriners bow in worship (and proclaim him the god of their fathers) in the Shrine initiation ceremony. The Shriner's blood oath and confession of Allah as God is found in the secret ritual book, THE MYSTIC SHRINE An Illustrated Ritual of the Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles of the Shrine (pp. 20-22). One must realize that ALLAH is not just another name for God. Allah is the name of another god and in usual occult fashion , the initiate swears that he will be inseparably obligated to this \"most powerful and binding oath,\" in advance, and that he may never retract or depart from it. During the butchering of the people of Fez, the str eets literally ran red with blood of the martyred Christians. The Muslim m urderers dipped their caps in the blood of their victims as testimony to Allah. These blood stained caps eventually were called Fezes and becam e the Muslim badge of honor. The Shriners wear that same Fez today. Th e greatest tragedy is that the Fez is often worn by men who profess to be Christians themselves. It must cause God to weep. A curious piece of the Masonic conspiracy puzzle in the founding of America is the actual layout for the Capital City o f Washington, D.C. Actually it's as much the audacity of the thing as the conspiratorial nature of it. You see, the city was laid out in the form o f key Masonic symbols, the \"Square,\" the \"Compass,\" the \"Rule,\" and the \"P entagram.\""},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Take any good street map of downtown Washington and find the Capital Building.

The left leg of the et aass stands on the White House a nd the right leg stands on the Jefferson Memorial. The circle drive and short streets behind the Capital form the head and ears of what Satanists ca ll the GOAT OF MENDES, or the GOAT'S HEAD! Map of Washington D.C.

The center of the pentagram is 16th Street where, t hirteen blocks due north of the very center of the White House, one finds th e Masonic HOUSE OF THE TEMPLE, which sits at the top of this occult ic eberg.

Within the hypotenu se of that right triangle sit many of the headquarter buildings for the most powerful departments of government, such as the Justice Depa rtment, U.S. Senate, and the Internal Revenue Service. It would be great to know that your nation's Capita l is bathed in continual prayer and to believe that its building and monumen ts have been dedicated in prayer, but do you realize that every key Federa l building from the White House to the Capital has had a cornerstone la id in a Masonic ritual and has specific Masonic paraphernalia placed in ea ch one. Again,"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"wonderful if we were talking about our one true God in all this, but such is not the case. The cornerstone of all these building s have been laid in Masonic ritual, dedicated to the demonic god of Fre emasonry, JAO-BUL- ON That is the secret name of the Masonic god, the LOST WORD in the rite of the Royal Arch Degree. JAO is the Greek name for the god of the Gnostics \"ladabaoth or lao;\" BUL is a rendering of the name \"Ba'al\" and ON is the Babylonian name for the Egyptian god \"OSIRI S.\" What we see represented in this name of the Masonic deity is a three- headed pagan deity so remote from the Page 53 Christian faith as to damn the eternal soul of anyo ne who would dare to pronounce its name in worship. 1 The Washington Monument actually represents the PHA LLIC PRINCIPLE upon which SPECULATIVE Masonry is based. From above, the monument and its circular drive, form the esote ric Masonic \"Point within a circle.\" The Reflecting Pool bears its sha dow image, with the illusion duplicated in the Lincoln Memorial. Strange? Not if you understand the occult principle s involved. The respected Masonic author and authority, Albert Mack ey, states in MACKEY'S MASONIC RITUALIST ; (pp. 62-63): \"The point within a circle is an interesting and im portant symbol in Freemasonry ...

Whatever the reasons, we do know that the Bible str ongly speaks about the fall of any nation whose leader defies the Word of God and consults mediums. The Satanic pentagram under which the Whit e House sits is an open door through which Satan has access to the Whi te House. The Pentagram, or five-pointed star is, of course, both a Masonic symbol and an ancient symbol of witchcraft. With its point facing down (or south), it is especially found in Satanism.

He pointed out that such a deidth is a spiri tual door to the occult, a planned invasion by the powers of darkness against this Christian nation. \"We have been under siege from the first day our Pr esident walked into the Oval Office,\" he said. Bill added that Albert Pike, the giant of Masonic p hilosophy who is entombed just 13 blocks from the White House in the HOUSE OF THE TEMPLE, has identified the pentagram (or PENTALPHA) as the blazing star which is at the heart of every Masonic lodge a nd which represents the star SIRIUS. 2 SIRIUS has been known for 5,000 years as the great evil. 3 Bill emphasized that to the magician, the inverted pentagram has one use only, and that is to call up the power of Satan and bring the Kingdom of the Devil into manifestation on earth. 4 Yet this very symbol straddles the corridors of our nation's power and is aimed right at the White House.

Although most recognize the Pentagon as the nerve center of our nation's defense establishment; few realize that the Pentagon itself is a geometric design used in magic and witchcraft as well. The Pentagon, through its use of the number 5 is as sociated profoundly with the planet Mars and the ancient Page 57 god of war, called variously ARIES, HORUS, or MARS. 5 This is because Mars is the fifth planet on the magical diagram, th e Tree of Life; among other reasons. The Pentagon is also one of the two secret symbols of the highest levels of Freemasonry, the ANCIENT AND ILLUMINATED SEERS OF BAVARIA (aka the Illuminati ) - the other being the Pentagram. It may be observed that every pentagram has a pentagon within it; and that every proper pentagram can fit perfectly point-to-point w ithin a pentagon. Thus, the magician sees the Pentagon as a gigantic talisman of war or battle.

We have not had a truly American Governme nt in Washington, D.C. for well over fifty years, no matter whether R epublicans or Democrats have been in Page 60 power. This alien control is seen when we take into account that there is very little change in government policies, when we see a change of Administration from one major party to the other. T hey are all controlled from the same international sources. Strangely enou gh, the majority of this pressure comes from a group of people we know as As hkenazi Jews. This group, working with the Esau-Edom population of the United States, makes up about 95% of the present world Jewish popu lation. We have been led to believe by Jewish statistics that this number is around 15 million, although, personally, I have reason to bel ieve it is much higher. The Esau-Edomite Jews have been a parasitic people who have never been able to exist on their own, so we find them inter-b reeding with anyone who will help them. They have made tremendous inroa ds into the royal families of Europe and have contaminated the royal blood line of King David until it is difficult to tell the difference between the Jew and the Israelite. On pg. 76, of Rabbi Jack Moline's book GROWING UP JEWISH , we read: \"For years, anti-Semites have accused Jews of contr olling Congress, and for years it has been denied. Ironica lly, as of 1984, the Jews do control Congress. A recent survey of the 435 representatives, shows that for all practical p urposes, 219 are practicing Jews.

What we are going to seek to ascertain in the remai nder of this book, is how this Talmudic Jewish influence has permeated Fr eemasonry and further increased the dictatorial control over the Christian world. Page 61 7 - THE TALMUDIC AND MASONIC ZOO Before we get into our in-depth discussion of the M asonic Lodge and its connection with Zionist Talmudism, I believe it wou ld be beneficial for us to look at some of the multitude of symbols which a re used in worldwide FREEMASONRY and discuss their implication. A great deal of the information in this chapter com es from Dr. Shepherd, a Mason for many years, who rose to a high degree bef ore he became a Christian and saw the desperate need of exposing th e Lodge. Dr. Shepherd is one of those rare, brave men, to whom God and co untry mean more than populof ty and personal safety. He has literally pu t his life on the line in order to expose this evil which has crept into our midst, in the \"guise of sheep's clothing.\" What I will share with you in this chapter, is a se ries of letters he wrote to me regarding FREEMASONRY and their ZIONIST CONNECTI ONS. These letters may seem to be somewhat disconnected, but if you read them all, I believe you will see the underlying message. Both TALMUDISM and FREEMASONRY are awash in animal symbolism. Each has its place in the ritual worship of the Talmudic and Masonic god. First Letter: \"The Masonic Lodge is the Jew-lodge and every lodg e is - no matter what name they use, Masonic or Jew. The f act which deceives so many, is that various names, titles, and lodges are given, but when you get to their roots you will see; First that a Jew s tarted it; second, a Jew will"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"be its Supreme Commander, or Grand Dragon as the Je ws call them.

The lion figure below adorned the wall of the throne-room in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar at Babylon (pg. 86). It is made of glazed brick in the brightest colors, which produced a gorgeous effect as architectural adornment. This art arose in Egypt, passed thence t o Assyria and Babylonia, and was then adopted by the Persians. Eastern Star, Shriners, are for all intents and pur poses all FREEMASONS. These have fought my attempts to expose them and fo ur attempts have been made against my life. Why? Because I know too much about them and try and alert others. In this first letter, I i ntend to show you who the Great Beast of Revelation 13 is and when I point th is out, you will probably say: \"Why didn't I see this. before?\" Revelation 13:1 and 2 \"And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a be ast rise up out of the sea ... and the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were the feet of a bear, an d his mouth the mouth of a lion.\" The word CUSH is used many times in the Bible to re present peoples from Africa and means LEOPARD to many people. When Jacob prophesied concerning his family in Genesis 49:9, he said of Judah:"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"\"Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son tho u art gone up; he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?\" The modern Ethiopians called themselves CUSHITES, o r LEOPARDS In Revelation 11:8, we read about \"that great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and EGYPT.\" The Great image of the SPHINX is found in Egypt, near Cairo Page 63 and is known in that part of the world as THE GREAT CAT! In the Egyptian BOOK OF THE DEAD the great god Toth says: \"I am RE, the MAUMAU\" MAU and LEOPARD have the same meaning! In Genesis 4:7 , when God spoke to Cain, after Cain became angry because God did not accept his offering, God said: \" ... sin lieth at the door.\" The Jews who translated this deliberately changed t he meaning of this verse, for the Chaldean word for SIN , as used here is CHATTAH or CHEETAH or LEOPARD. The word \" lieth \" should be \"couches,\" and is the act of the female cat as she prepares to breed. In other words, this verse should have read: \"The leopardess couches bef ore you.\" Page 64"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"When the question arises as to who was Cain's wife, the answer of course was she was the LEOPARDESS, NOT THE ANIMAL CAT, BUT A HUMAN WITCH. Not how closely the HOLYCAT (CATholic)is bound up in these verses. Don't say: \"That's Rome,\" since Rome is only a smal l part of it. All seven churches in the book of Revelation claim to be cath olic. The Apostle's Creed in its original form read: \"I believe in the holy catholic (universal) church.\" CATHOLIC goes back to the Garden of Eden and Genesis 3. In Numbers 26:44, we read about the JESUITS Have you ever heard that name before? Of course you have! The JESUITS are th e HOLY-CATS (CATholics) Old Cain was a CATholic who sacrificed the EU-CHRIST. In the above picture of Herod's coin, 37 - 4 B.C., it had no connection with Rome but was of Jewish origin. A close perusal of Albert Pike's monumental work on MASONRY, MORALS AND DOGAM , take the MASONIC LODGE back to Cain. Second Letter: Surprising enough, I begin my discussion of FREEMASONRY with Genesis 3:1. This serpent was not a snake. The Hebrew word under here is NAHASH The Navajo Indians still use this word today, it is pronounced NAH-GAH-OSHEE and mean s: \"witch doctor; guru; voodoo; sorcerer.\" That's what Cain was! In Genesis 3, the Creator said to the \"serpent,\" \"on thy belly you shall go.\" But the word \"BELLY,\" should have Page 65 read: \"On all fours shall you go.\" A cat travels on all fours doesn't it? Since NAHASH IS A WITCH, AND A CAT IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH WITCHES AND WITCHCRAFT, I believe t he serpent was a CAT."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"For further proof - What did Adam and Eve do when t hey disobeyed God by eating of the forbidden fruit? The Bible says th ey hid themselves among the trees of the garden, this is a characteri stic of the CAT. The LEOPARD, LEO (Lion), PAN (PANther) all come fro m the same word. Here are words with a similar meaning: PARD; panther; panthera; (PANTHERA is \"female); MAU; PUMA; CHATTAH; CHEETAH; CUSH; NIMROD. Each of these were HOLY CATS and were worshiped in their area and today, the cat is worshiped world wide. In Central and South America it is the JAGUAR. But note carefully that the CAT is named after CUS H. This is what the Jews call \"tran smigration of the soul.\" The cat, according to them, is actually CUSH living in the CAT. This is why many Africans call themselves CUSHITES. (When I was a Game Warden in Ethiopia, 1958-62, I w as impressed by the reverence the animist [worshipers of the spirits of nature] natives had for the Hyena, calle d \"fisi,\" which is one of the most horrible of the animals Go d created. In this part of the country, when a man or woman becomes too old to work, or benefit the family, the y are often left outside the village fence and become liv ing prey for the hyenas. The natives themselves, will not ki ll these horrible animals, although they prey on both human and cattle, because they believe the spirits of their a ncestors, who the hyenas have devoured, live on in the animal - ED.) The big CAT is the LION . The mouth of the LION is its most dangerous part and the MOUTH of the ancient family was called the PATRIARCH. This opens a fact which has been hidden for thousan ds of years. We know that Catholics literally worship ST. PETER, he his called PATRA-arch, which means ANCIENT STONE. Page 66 It is interesting to note that the word HAM is HA'M ER or STONE. The PATRA-arch of the family is the ANCIENT STONE of th e family. Since the head of the family, HAM was called the LION, th erefore the church calls itself CATholic. If you will look closely at any picture of the Grea t CAThedral of Babylon, some call it the TEMPLE you will notice on each sid e of the entrance, a large stone lion with a man's head. The word \" HEDRA ,\" from which the last part of the word CAT-HEDRAL comes, means \"head ,\" orin most"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"cases \"cat's head.\" This does not refer to leopards or cheetah's but to the King of Beasts, the LION. Thus the head of the ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH , St. Peter, is known in Egypt as PTAH , which means \"Ancient Stone.\" In the Egyptian BOOK OF THE DEAD, the word mouth is the LION. PTAH was Egypt's great god. The Bible tells us that Egypt is the land of HAM. You make the connection. In CHALDEAN the Word BAB also means \"mouth.\" Thus a gain \"the LION'S MOUTH.\" The LEOPARD also has a mouth like a LION and the native word for him is PARD . What is a PARD? It is a PANTHER LION-LEOPARD the mouth or religion. In the U.S. the religion of the Beast is LIONISM or HAMISM or more commonly known a s BABYLONIANISM Revelation 11:8 refers to \"That great city Babylon in Egypt.\" It is symbolic, since there was no great city in Egypt called BABYLON It is interesting to note, that when you travel to Egypt and see the great SPHINX, you see a cat body with a human head, the s ame as in the doorway of the BABYLONIAN TEMPLE. Many Jews carry a \"cat's paw.\" Twelve LIONS stood o n the six steps leading to Solomon's throne and Jacob said that JUD AH, representative of the JEWS was a \"crouching lion,\" (Gen. 49:9). Page 67 The cat represents a witch, witchcraft and the word \"cat\" in the ancient tongue meant \"whore.\" This is where the term \"cat h ouse\" came from. The cat is also called a \"Pussy,\" which is the vulgar t erm used for a woman's sexual parts. These things, unknown to most Christi ans, had their beginnings from the time of Cain. Third Letter: (I am only printing those things which pertain to FREEMASONRY. Dr. Shepherd has sent me much more, de aling with the Seedline theory and other matters, which we will no t be covering in this book. This will be the concluding remarks from Dr. Shepherd. If any of my readers would like to contact him, please write me for his address - ED.) Eve's penalty for eating the \"forbidden fruit\" was \"death.\" (Gen. 2:17). When Cain offered his sacrifice to God, it was refu sed, not because it was"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"a vegetable sacrifice, as some preachers say, but b ecause it was \"devil's bread.\" The root word for CAIN , or CANA, is \"black\" and this takes us to the root of FREEMASONRY The MASONIC password is TU-BAL-CAIN (See Gen. 4:20-22 ). It is CAIN, or the devil himself who admits one into the Masonic Lodge. If you don't want to take my wor d for it, then take the word of a strict Jew-Mason, who was converted to Ch ristianity and had his life completely changed, the Apostle Paul. In Philippians 3:2 he says: \"beware of DOGS, beware of EVIL WORKERS, BEWARE OF THE CONCISION.\" (The Greek word for \"concision\" is \"karatome\" which means: \"to mutilate.\" Like in ''circumcision.'') Ma sons call themselves DOGS. In Isaiah 56:10 we read about \" ... dumb dogs that cannot (or will not) bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. Yea, they are greedy DOGS which can never have enough (are never satisfied) ... \" In John 8:44 they are called: \"Of their father the devil,\" an apt description for Masons and Jews alike. Page 68 The MAFIA, KGB, CIA, MOSSAD, the spies of MASONRY a re the DOGS or DEVILS of FREEMASONRY. There is not a place on earth which is free from their spies. On every continent, in every country, city and town, these spies are present. Albert Pike, the chief \"guru\" of MASONRY, says that Masons call their god THE GREAT ARCHITECT. If you read Genesis 4:17 , you will find the name of the first Mason, CAIN, the builder, the architect. Archaeologists do not know who built the Great Pyra mids of Egypt, the greatest building project the world has ever known. They do not know who erected the mammoth images on Easter Island or the monoliths of Stonehenge, or the pyramids in Mexico on this conti nent. Could CAIN have been called THE GREAT ARCHITECT, be cause he built the first recorded city? Could the builder of the Egyptian pyramids have been called THE GREAT ARCHITECT? Do you doubt that Masons are builders? Jesus hints at this when He spoke to the JEW-MASON Sin Matthew 21:42 and told them: \" ... The stone which the builders (masons) rejected, the same is become the head of the corner ."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"If Masons worship Lucifer, as Albert Pike affirms, then THE GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE must of necessity be the devil - the BLACKDOG. No one has ever been able to figure how the mammoth stones of the Great Pyramid, many weighing a hundred tons or more, were lifted 490 feet to be fitted in place. We have no modern machinery tha t can accomplish this. Could it have been done by demonic power? (When I was in Ethiopia, I became acquainted with a Coptic priest who was a graduate of Cambridge Unive rsity. He showed me the massive obelisk at Axum, the ancie nt capital of the Queen of Sheba's Empire. This huge s tone is 97 feet tall, by 24 feet at the base and is estimat ed to weigh about Page 69 2700 tons. It is hewn from a solid piece of black g ranite, the closest quarries of which are in Yemen, across 400 miles of land and the Red Sea. This monument, which is over 5,000 years old, was erected on a mountain pla teau, about 7,000 feet elevation, which means this huge s tone would have had to be moved up an almost perpendicul ar cliff, some 2,000 feet from the valley below. Again , modern engineers marvel at how this was done. This Coptic priest told me that the ancients had the power of \"levitation.\" They were able to overcome gravity, h e told me, through \"spirit power.\" Is this how the Great P yramid at Giza, Egypt was erected? - ED) Could it have been demonic power that made these fe ats possible? The Apostle Paul tells us in 2 Thes. 2:9 about one whose coming would be \"after the working of Satan, with ALL POWER ... \" Does Satan have the power to move huge stones? There is an authentic account of a scientist who wa s in the Amazon in 1987 and watched as natives erected a pyramid, movi ng huge stones into position through \"spirit power.\" No, my skeptical f riends, there is little doubt that Satan can lift huge stones and that the builder of the Great Pyramid was the GREAT ARCHITECT. Fourth Letter: THE CITY OF DEVILS "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"1 - In Arabic, the word CAIN , or CANA means \"devil.\" In Revelation 18:2, we are told that great BABYLON has \"become the hab itation (dwelling place) of devils, and the hold (cage) of every foul spirit ... \" The first city, built by CAIN, was a \"city of devils.\" 2 - ENOS , or ENOCH , after whom this first city was named, was the son of CAIN. This city was utterly depraved. 3 - LAMECH - the great-great-great (I think I have this right) grandson of CAIN married a woman whose name was ADAH. It is int eresting to note that in India today, ADA or ADAH, is one of their m ost feared goddesses. She Page 70 can cast deadly diseases on persons, they believe, on animals and even fish and crops and has been known to have her adherents burn the houses of those who refuse to sacrifice to her. ZILLAH, LAMEC H'S second wife, means \"shade,\" \"ghost,\" or \"demon.\" The question mi ght be asked: \"Is it possible for a man to live with a demon in a woman' s form?\" I believe it is and that demons can take any form they desire. Ther e are documented reports of men who had lived with demons in human f orm. (Unfortunately, Dr. Shepherd does not give us this documentation -ED.) 4 - GIANTS - Genesis 6:4. The word used here for GIANTS is GIGANTE which does not refer to men of great size b ut to \"demon possessed men.\" Could this be the meaning of verse 5 which says: \"And God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts o f his heart was only evil continually.\" In other words, these men were \"devils; witches; sw amies; Masons.\" 5 - HAM was the founder of the city of SODOM after the Flo od. Would you call this a \"city of devils?\" 6 - The TOWER OF BABEL (Gen. 11:1-5) was built by CUSH the \"Great Cat,\" and NIMROD, the \"hunter of men.\" Would you call this tower an evil place? All these places mentioned, we re built by the Masonic god, THE GREAT ARCHITECT. 7 - The PYRAMIDS were probably built by the same god."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"8 - SOLOMON'S TEMPLE, which many people believe was built for the glory of God, was a \"temple of the devil..\" It was erected for the worship of Lucifer, the Masonic god and this is why it is so important in Masonry. Page 71 9 - JEZEBEL -this evil woman, who led her husband, the king of Israel and the Israel people into idolatry, was a witch. W e see her mentioned in the \"end times\" as seducing the church at Thyatira (see Rev. 2:20). 10 - JERUSALEM - Many false religious prophets have taught that t his was the \"holy city.\" Not so! There is no letter \"3\" in the Hebrew language, so the name of this city in Palestine is GURU-SALEM \"OU\" means \"black,\" \"RU\" means \"stones.\" Why do the Jews and M asons want that place in Palestine? Because it was and is the BABYLONIAN SYSTEM . In Isaiah 57:3, 6 we read: \"But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorcerers (wi tches) among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portio n ... \" The \"smooth stones\" represent the high gurus, witch es, sorcerers, and officials of JUDAISM and FREEMASONRY. 11- MYSTERY BABYLON - Called in Revelation 18:2 \"the home of devils ... \" Masonry, my dear brothers, is of the devil. It is t he city of the devil. It is: a. -The \"great hypocrisy.\" b. -The \"great conspiracy.\" c. -The \"great beast.\" d. -The \"great whore.\" e. -The \"great sorceress.\" LETTER #5 - When Adam and Eve sinned, God made them coats of skin. Our pastors have told us these were sheep ski ns. I believe they were the skins of the lion and leopard and this is the r eason why heathen high priests still use these skins as a sign of their hi gh office. In their KABALLAH, the Jewish TALMUD-MISHNA, the Jewish rabbis say: \"Ham smuggled and hid the coat of "},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" Page 72 Adam in the ark and used it after the Flood to gain power.\" Could this have been the same garment that Achan took at Jeric ho ( Joshua 7:21 ), some believe it was. The TALMUD says that NIMROD had received this garment which gave him great power and that this wa s stolen by ESAU, when he assassinated NIMROD. This is the reason, th ey claim, that Esau was so exhausted the day he sold his birthright to his brother Jacob (see Gen. 25:30-32 ). The story goes that he had been fleeing from NIM ROD'S MEN, after he had killed their king. The NEW AGE of FREEMASONRY is nothing new. It is the same old demonism, Satanism and voodooism which has been pra cticed worldwide since the Garden of Eden. The god that Masons demand their \"proselytes,\" or i nitiates\" worship is Satan or Lucifer (see Matt. 23:15 ). This is confirmed by Albert Pike in his MORALS AND DOGAM . Masons believe there are two gods - brothers, if you will. There is LUCIFER, the \"good guy,\" whom they worship, and ADONAY-JESUS Christ, who is the \"bad g uy.\" A constant warfare is going on between these forces of \"good\" and \"evil.\" But of this you can be sure, THE GREAT ARCHITECT OF MASONRY is not the God of the Bible, or Christianity. Their symbol wor ldwide is that of the CAT. It is interesting also to note that God calls PHARA OH, the king of Egypt, \"the great dragon,\" ( Ezek. 29:3 ). This is the same term used in Rev. 12:9. It does not refer to a man. You no doubt have heard Egypt called the \"land of the PHARAOHS?\" But in all actuality, it should b e called \"the land of the devil.\" Ignorance of facts is the destruction of our white, Christian people. Hosea 4:6 tells us that \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\" Not \"lack of education,\" but \"lack of knowledge.\" -THE END- Page 73 I would like to thank Dr, Shepherd for his contribu tion.

Much has been said about the Jewish, or maybe it wo uld be more accurate to say the Zionist, interests which influence Freem asonry. Few members of the lower orders know the significance of this, or its importance to them, This is especially true if they are Christian s. There is no doubt that the Zionist question MUST be linked with the MASONIC question. At present, as in the past, Zioni st world leaders, and men in high positions with the Masonic organization , have worked \"hand in glove\" for a universal world revolution, which w ill bring in the One- World Church and a One-World Government. Many Mason ic Lodges are exclusively Jewish, as are the B'nai B'rith Lodges, the mother of the infamous and very dangerous Anti-Defamation League, which is an unregistered agent of a foreign government (Israeli ) which has been allowed by our government to operate unhindered on American soil. Although this Jewish organization is totally illega l, such is the strength of both the Masonic and Zionist Lobby in Washington, D .C., that the Government refuses to do anything to curb their pow er or control their operations on American soil, often at the expense o f American citizens. Wherever you look, you will find Freemasonry uphold ing and defending Zionist interests, even to the detriment of the saf ety of this country. This in itself should give you a good idea of the entwining interests of the two which can be seen in the seventy U.S. Senators who are Page 80 Zionist controlled and vote a \"straight Zionist tic ket\" when the interests of Zionism come to the fore. These men in Washington, who have taken an"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"oath to defend this country and its Constitution fr om all enemies, both foreign and domestic, will vote for Israeli interes ts, even when they are contrary to the well being of this country. For all intents and purposes, these men are TRAITORS. in the Constitution, ARTICL E III, Section 3, gives a definition of TREASON, which is so clear th at even a Fifth Grader can understand it. It says: \"Treason shall consist only in levying war against them (the US.) adhering to their enemies; g iving them aid and comfort.\" If what has been done for the Israelis in recent ye ars, has not been \"giving aid and comfort to our enemies,\" then I fail to understand the meaning of the English language. For all intents and purposes, the A.D.L. has become an unofficial part of the U.S. Justice Department, giving them periodic b iased reports on \"terrorism and anti-Semitism\" in the U.S., which is \"extremely prejudicial\" to Christian patriots. Every effort to investigate the power of the A.D.L. has been thwarted by establishment lawye rs in high places, almost all of whom are either Jews and/or Masons. There are two theories regarding the TALMUDIC influ ence in Freemasonry: 1.- That the Jewish leadership, worldwide, created Masonry in order to corrupt the nations of Christendom and propagate th e final world domination for Zionism. In other words, this idea s ays that Freemasonry is merely a tool of world Jewry. This idea is supported by an article written by Dr. Isaac M. Wise, a Jew, and published in THE ISRAELITE OF AMERICA , Aug. 3, 1866. He said: \"Masonry is a Jewish institution, whose history, de grees, charges, passwords and explanations are Jewish from end to e nd.\" Page 81 One can easily believe this, if they compare the oa ths of Freemasonry with those of the TALMUD, which is the \"life blood\" of m odern Judaism. 2.- Second, is the idea that Freemasonry was a good , sound institution in principle, but that revolutionary agitators, princi pally Jewish, took advantage of its organization as a secret society a nd penetrated it little by little until they gained control of it. These Zioni sts, they say, corrupted Masonry and turned it from its moral and philanthro pic aim, to employ it for revolutionary purposes."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"In support of this contention, we have the writings of such men as the Jew Bernard Lazare in his book L 'ANTISEMITISME , in which he states: \"What were the relations between the Jews and the s ecret societies? That is not easy to elucidate, for we la ck reliable evidence . . . they are not necessarily in the head , the soul, the Grand Masters of Masonry. It is certain, howeve r, that there were Jews at the very cradle of Masonry, kaba listic Jews, as some of their rites prove.\" 9 - JEWISH INFLUENCE ON MASONRY DEMONSTRATED BY REASON: These arguments can be summed up as: a.- Freemasonry is a secret society b.- Freemasonry is directed by an international min ority, and, c. -Freemasonry has sworn implacable hatred for Christianity. These are some of the same characteristics which ca n be found in international Judaism and which could prove Jewish influence in the Lodge. Jews have more to gain from Freemasonry than anyone else. Page 82 NOTE CAREFULLY: 1.- Many of the external trappings of Freemasonry, such as its ritual, symbols, terminology, legends, etc., ar e of Jewish origin. 2.- The philosophy or religion of esoteric Freemaso nry (that understood only by the inner circle) is pract ically identical to that of the Jewish Cabala. 3.- Certain small groups of Jews, of immense influe nce and wealth, are leading Freemasons, and; 4.- A larger group of very influential Jews, pursue the same goals as Freemasonry, using similar means and are i n close alliance with them."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"I believe it would only be honest to say here, that although the Jewish element in Freemasonry is of greatest importance, a nd that Jewish Masonic leaders often exploit the Lodge for their o wn nefarious purposes, it is unjust to accuse all Jews, or all Masons of b eing involved in this scheme for world control. Many of the \"Lesser Jews, \" the ones which you and I are most apt to rub shoulders with, just as m any members of the Masonic Blue Lodge, know very little about this int ernational scheme for world control, and are innocent dupes of a power th at is over them. Many of these people are against One-World government, w ithout realizing that their leaders are pushing them into it. These are t he ones who must be reached with the truth. We know that it will be nex t to impossible to reach those in high positions, as their mind is already \" set in cement,\" but we hope to reach those who have been \"hoodwinked\" into a society they really know very little about and which many of the m would repudiate if they knew the truth. The Jewish people have suffered, are suffering, and will suffer severely in the future, because of wicked, unscrupulous atrocit ies committed by the ruling Jewish-Masonic junta. Page 83 10 - MODERN JUDAISM It is necessary for you to have at least a \"nodding acquaintance\" with the Babylonian Talmud, which is the heart blood of mode rn Judaism, in order for you to understand the influence it exerts on Fr eemasonry. Modern Judaism, according to Jewish sources, is mod ern Pharisaism. Rabbi Louis Finkeistein, head of the Jewish Theolog ical Seminary of America, in the foreword to his first edition of THE PHARISEES, THE SOCIOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF THEIR FAITH , says on p.21: \" ... Judaism ... Pharisaism ... Talmudism became Medieval Rabbinism; Medieval Rabbinism became Modern Rabbinism. But throughout all the changes in name; the spirit of the ancient Pharisees survives unaltered. \" Rabbi Michael Rondkinson, in his book THE HISTORY OF THE TALMUD , writes: \"The source from which Jesus of Nazareth drew His teachings, which enabled Him to revolutionize the w orld ..."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"is the Talmud ... the written form of that which, in the times of Jesus, was called the 'Traditions of the Elders. \"' The falsity of this statement can easily be seen, w hen one does some research into this religious book of the Jews and t hen looks at the statements made by Jesus Christ in regard to them i n both Matt. 15:9 and Mark 7:7, 13. In this latter Scripture, speaking directly to the Pha risees, He said: \"You make the word of God of none effect through yo ur tradition, which ye have delivered; and many such t hings do ye.\" The TALMUD is so filthy and absurd, that it is blas phemy to say that Jesus drew the teachings of Christianity from this religious cesspool. The second major source of Judaism is the Cabala, sometimes spelled Kabbala. This is the mystic, corrupt, Page 84 occult teachings that apostate Judeans brought home with them when they returned from seventy years of Babylonian captivity . The TALMUD was begun about 500 B.C. and was finally completed, in its written form, about 500 A.D. at the great Jewish center in Alexanderia, Egypt. It contains the arguments of leading Jewish Rabbis as they argue ov er points in the Jewish religion. Today, the vast majority of religi ous Jews look to the TALMUD as their guide in religious and civil matter s and it has rightly been called by them, the \"heart blood of modern Jud aism.\" In the minds of most Jews, it has replaced the ancient TORAH. Even in the time of Jesus, the Pharisees bragged about how they followed the t eachings of Moses and were repudiated by Christ when He told them: \"Had you believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.\" (John 5:46). In another place (Matt. 23:2) - \"The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat (in o ther words they had usurped the authority of Moses); All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that obs erve and do; but do not do after their works; for they s ay, and do not. \" In other plainer words, they were \"hypocrites\" and this is what He called them to their face (See Matt. 23:15) - \"Woe, unto you, scribes and"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass (go over) se a and land to make one proselyte (convert), and when he is made, you make him two-fold more a child of hell than yourself.\" Pretty plain talk, isn't it? The Jewish apologist, Bernard Lazare refers to the TALMUD as \"the creator of the Jewish nation, and the mould of the Jewish soul\" (L 'ANTISEMITISME , p.293). The TALMUD is impregnated with hatred for Jesus Chr ist and the Christian church, although some of the more virulen t passages have been removed from the English translations and are unkno wn to many liberal and non-religious Jews. They are still taught in th e Jewish seminaries. Page 85 The Cabala was originally used to indicate that por tion of the Mosaic law which was handed down by tradition. Since about the Thirteenth Century, however, it has come to refer to the esoteric (unde rstood only by the upper elite) and occult doctrines of Judaism, which were learned in Babylon and are woven into the tapestry of Freemasonry. The mos t authoritative work on the Jewish Cabala can be found in the ZOHAR or SEPHERLA- ZOHAR, WHICH IS PART OF THE 63 VOLUME TALMUD. These books contain the mystical, occult teachings of modern Judaism and Freemasonry and are often tied in closely with myst ic occult teachings from the Far East. This system of occultism is some times called \"hermeticism, \"named after the god Hermes, who was the Greek god of wisdom, corresponding to the Roman god Mercury. (We see his symbol in many areas of modern life, such as the telegraph se rvice.) This belief takes in \"Theosophism,\" which means the \"physical appearance of God to man.\" Christian Science, Neo-P latonism, Judaism and Jewish heathen Cabalism. It is actually part of the revival of the Gnostic heresies which played such havoc in the Fir st century Christian church and which provided the Christian world of Co nstantine, with an acceptable substitute for Christianity. Their adher ents are still attempting to do this in Freemasonry. The major connection between Judaism and Freemasonr y can be seen in the Cabala, where there is a very close association between the secret teachings and doctrines of Judaism and Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"One school of thought is that Freemasonry was broug ht into existence by the Jews, for the destruction of Christianity. This view, of course, is accepted by acknowledged anti-Jewish writers. Howev er, it does not come into accord with established facts, since the Jews were Page 86 excluded from many of the early English and French Lodges of the 18th Century. The second school of thought is that Jewish Cabalis tic tradition is one of the principle means through which Eastern occultism has been transmitted to the Christian world. This can be seen most clear ly in the NEW AGE MOVEMENT, which has swept like wildfire through the Christia n world in recent months. When men begin to lean on their o wn understanding, rather than the Word of God, and seek to \"do their own thing,\" instead of obeying His law, they are easy prey for philosophie s such as the NEW AGE. Most of the leaders in Illuminism and Communism wer e initiated into the secrets by Jewish cabalists, as were early Masonic leaders such as Albert Pike. They drew their inspiration from secret Jewis h writings. This can be clearly seen by an honest perusal of Pike's MORALS AND DOGMA . (It can also be seen by reading Nesta Webster's SECRET SOCIETIES AND SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENTS , Chapters 7, 8 and 9. Many of the Jewish cabalists were MARRANOS a name given to them in Spain, where they supposedly converted to Catholici sm in order to avoid the persecution of the Inquisition. During the day, they were Catholics, sometimes even priests and Cardinals, but at night they would revert back to Judaism and in their secret enclaves, they follo wed the occult practices of ancient Babylon, even including human sacrifices . When war between England and Spain became a reality, many of these M arannos threw off their protective cloak of Christianity and openly r everted to Judaism and were welcomed by the English. To see how these secret Jews operate, it is only ne cessary to look at the controversial book The Protocols Of The Learned Elders Of Zion .

I do not have time here to go into a discussion of this much maligned document, except to say that it follows very closel y a much simpler blueprint of a similar document which printed in 18 89, by James de Rothschild and was a copy of a document which was sent out to European Jews in 1289, by Rabbi Chemor, head Rabbi of France. Chemor wrote to the Grand Sanhedrin of France: \"The advice of the Grand Satraps (world governors of the Jews) and Rab bis is as follows: 1.- Make your sons merchants, that little by little they may despoil Christians of their possessions. 2.- Make of your sons doctors and apothecaries, tha t they may take away Christian lives. 3.- Make of your sons, canons and clerics (clergies ), that they may destroy Christianity from within. (There i s hardly a Christian Seminary in America, which is not infil trated by Jewish professors on their faculty). 4.- Arrange for your sons to become advocates and lawyers, and see that they mix themselves up with t he affairs of the State, in order that by putting Chri stians under your yoke, you may dominate the world and be avenge d on them - SIGNED: V.

It is not difficult to see how international Judais m, especially Zionism, has followed this Protocol and how they have been helpe d into positions of world power by FREEMASONRY.

He was a member of the Lodge of St. Theodore, to which Adam Weishaupt , the founder of the Illuminati, belonged. There is much evidence available that the program f or revolution which was carried out in France, was formulated in the Lo dges of German Freemasons, who formed the nucleus of the Illuminat i in 1776. (Although Weishaupt used Freemasonry as a step towa rds more power, he hated it and was its enemy.) Arthur Pruess, an American author, in his book A STUDY IN FREEMASONRY , shows the close connection between Masonry and the Jewish Cabal. He sums up his arguments from the cel ebrated Masonic leader, Albert Pike: \"All true dogmatic (stating an opinion without proo f) religions come from the Kabbala and lead back to it; all that is scient ific and great in the religious dream Of all the illuminated such as Bach me, Swedenborg, St. Martin, and others similar, is borrowed from the Ka bbalah. All the Masonic associations owe their secrets and symbols to it.\" 1 In 1901, a German Mason by the name of Findel wrote : \"It is less a question of a struggle for the intere sts of humanity, than a struggle for the interests and dom ination of Judaism. In this struggle, Judaism reveals itsel f as the dominant power to which Freemasonry must submit. Indeed, we should not be astonished by this, for in a hidden and carefully disguised manner, Judaism is already the dominate power in many lodges in Europe. Notes:- 1.

They knew that both Ru ssia and Germany stood in their path of world aggression, so as earl y as 1900, the Jewish Cabal had a war chest of some $2-billion, laid asid e specifically for the destruction of Christian Germany. This was long bef ore a little Austrian \"paperhanger\" by the name of Adolf Hitler came on t he scene. The International Jewish Cabal, planned in its long range scheme of things, the ultimate destruction of Canada and the United States, in order to control the Western Hemisphere. Those of us who have been a student of the Jewish question, have seen this assault in o peration in this country for over fifty years. (For those who would like mor e information on this phase of the conspiracy, I would suggest you write for my book THE GREAT CONSPIRACY). The Cabala and the Talmud Nahmanides, Solomon ibn Adret, Joseph Caro, Moses Isserles, and Elijah b. Solomon of Wilna were not only supporters of the Cabala, but even contributed largely to its development. As these me n were the actual representatives of true Talmudic Judaism, there must have been somethingiblythe Cabala that attracted them. It can not have been it s and the metaphysics; for Talmudic Judaism was not greatly interested in such speculations.

So do the Jews! \"When the Bastil e fell,\" said Bonnet, the speaker at the Grand Orient Assembly in 1904, \" Freemasonry had the supreme honor of giving humanity the chart which it had lovingly elaborated.\" On August 15, 1789, the Constitutional Assembly of France, of which more than 300 members were Masons, adopted almost w ord for word, the form determined in the Lodges, which became known a s the 'Declaration of the Rights of Man.\" It was a simple denunciation of the Kingship of Jesus Christ, and membership in His body, the churc h. The French State openly declared in this Masonic prepared document, that they no longer acknowledged any duty towards God or Jesus Christ a nd that they no longer recognized the dignity of membership in the Christian church. It organized a vicious attack against Jesus Christ and His Kingdom, which has been carried on relentlessly until the present day. That was their first step. The subservience of Free masonry to Judaism soon showed itself. When the question of Jewish ema ncipation came up in the Constitutional Assembly (1789-1791), it was Mas onic deputy Mirabeau, who linked up with the Jews of Berlin and A. DuPont, who rendered the first secret service of Judaism by Fre emasonry. There were many more such acts to follow By 1789, the French State had completely ostracized Christianity, while admitting Jews to full membership. This accounted f or the domination of state after state in Europe by the Jews. During suc cessive Masonic Page 91 revolutions from 1789 to the Spanish Revolution in 1931, the world had heard of the enlightening reforms which separated c hurch from state. With these reforms came a proliferation of divorce, secularization of education, the suppression of Christianity, the neu tralization of private"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"property and the unrestrained license of the press for the glorification of world Zionism and Masonry. As early as 1922, the Assembly of the Grand Lodge o f France began to work towards the formation of a United States of Eu rope, as the forerunner of their Federation of the World. In North America - Canada and the United States - M asonry and Zionism worked hand in hand, as they invited these two Chri stian nations to give up their sovereignty and enter a world Federation w hich would be controlled by Masonic Jews. But we had enough patri otic Congressmen in Washington at that time, that their dream was disru pted and our entrance into the League of Nations was voted down. In April of 1919, Mr. Outerdyke, the Dutch minister to Russia at St. Petersburg, wrote in a British \"white paper:\" \"Unless Bolshevism is nipped in the bud immediately , it is bound to spread in one form or another over Europe and the whole world. It is organized and worked by Jews who have no nationality, and whose one object is to destroy for their own ends, the existing order of things.\" His warning went unheeded, in England particular In G. K.

As a rule, Freemasons admit the ex istence of God, but they themselves openly confess that they do not adhere t o this truth. They allow their members the greatest license on this point, a s they are at liberty to believe that God exists, or that He does not. The recognition by the Grand Lodges of the article relating to the GRAND ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE, does not signify that this branch of Freemasonry accepts the supremacy of Jesus Christ. Like all sections of"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Masonry, which put Buddha and Confucius on the same level as Jesus Christ, they deny Christ's role as mediator between God and man. Many of the English Lodges are made up completely of Jews, who of course deny the divinity of Jesus Christ. The formation of Masonic \"toleration of all religio ns,\" is actually a positive hatred of the Divine plan for man's salvat ion, through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Some Masons believe that their association goes bac k to Adam and we have seen in Dr. Shepherd's explanation, that he be lieves it goes back to CAIN at least. Other Masons try and trace its found ation back to Abraham, Moses, or David and Solomon. The modern version of Freemasonry had its roots in Europe during the rapid rise of atheism and anti-Christianity. By the beginning of the Nineteenth Century, the Reformation Movement had ab out run its course. The principles of the Reformation, which had allowe d private interpretation of the Scriptures and which had been introduced with the best of intentions as the pure worship of Jesus Chr ist, had ended, as men's efforts often do, by leaving no part of Christ's te aching unchallenged. Men began to attack His divinity, His resurrection and His very existence. These were men who called themselves Christian. Page 93 It was during this time, about 150 years ago, that a German Jewish philosopher named Ludwig Feurbach declaimed: \"Man will finally be truly free, when he realizes there is no god of man , but man himself\" This idea became so deeply implanted in the diseased bra in of a young Jewish radical named Karl Mordecal Marx, that it became the foundation of both Illuminism and Communism. A LEAGUE was begun in Germany by a man named Socinu s, which bound groups of Polish and German Protestants into a League, or Lodge, if you will, where the only requirement was an undy ing hatred and opposition to the Roman Catholic Church. A man by the name of Boyle threw doubt on everything which had been taught by Christianity, while Spinoza destroyed what little respect was left for the Deity. Both deists and pantheists (the doct rine that God is not a personality but that all forces are t, wnifestation of the self-existing"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"universe and are therefore gods). This theory made so much headway in Europe and England in the early 1800's as to almost destroy Christianity. What had once been Protestantism, often turned into what was popular called \"Free Thinking.\" France owed its evil pre-em inence in a great degree to a man named Voltaire. He was an extraordinary man and was possibly the greatest disciple of atheism and \"Free Thinking\" the world has ever known. Abetted and aided by Judaism, he se t out to destroy the Christian world. He once bragged that what Christ a nd His disciples had taken almost 2,000 years to develop, he would destr oy in one generation. He was the son of ardent Roman Catholic parents, wi th excellent schooling and had been trained by the Jesuits. (It may be of interest to note here that the Jesuits were controlled by Jews who h ad infiltrated the order begun by Fr. Ignatis Loyola in 1534). Voltaire had been trained to be a lawyer and appare ntly learned all the guile and trickery for which the Jesuits were Page 94 noted. At this time, the courts of Europe were rott en to the core. Many of their leaders, often professing to be Christian, we re libertarians of the worst sort, showing very little Christian fruit in their lives. The court of Catherine the Great, in Russia, for in stance, was noted for its unabashed lewdness, while the court of Frederick th e Great of Prussia was so corrupt that it cannot even be ribed by decent language. The Regent of Orleans and Louis XV of France, had carried sexual license to such an extent that t he Court at Versailles was in utter confusion. Vice became the order of th e day and as a consequence, the libertines hated anyone who took e xception to their excesses. Voltaire, appearing in the midst of this scene was a witty, sarcastic, vicarious fellow who found himself at home with the voluptuaries who filled Paris. His conduct was so bad however, and his habit of ri diculing royalty so open, that he landed in the Bastille at the age of 27. He was liberated in 1727, on the condition that he leave France and nev er return. He crossed the English Channel and lived in England for half a century in what was"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"described as: \"the most perfect incarnation of Satan the world ha d ever seen.\" At this time, the society of Freemasonry was just b eginning to gain a foothold in London, and Voltaire became an enthusia stic member of one of the Lodges. He returned to the continent during the years 1726-1728, where he became an adept, not only for Freemasonry, but also of infidelity. His hatred of the monarchial government of France, which had imprisoned him, was almost beyond human understandi ng. He was a master of French prose and his writings ag ainst morality and Christianity were received with great favor by the corrupt, reading public of his day. He was adept at the Page 95 use of ridicule and blasphemy, which he used agains t anything that smacked of Christianity. Nothing was sacred to him and he viciously attacked Joan D'Arc, the \"Maid of Orleans,\" with as little scruples as he at tacked Christianity. His teaching was that a reign of terror would spread ov er the world and that it would continue as long as there was a vestige of Ch ristianity left. His teaching was actually the forerunner of Communist t error today. He was an adept liar and wrote to his disciple Ther iot: \"lying is a vice when it does evil. It is a great virtue when it doe s good. Be therefore more virtuous than ever. It is necessary to lie like a d evil, not timidly, and for a time, but boldly and forever.\" He was a profound hypocrite who used religion when it became necessary for his evil purposes. Writing to a man named Damil aville, he said: \"The Christian religion is an infamous religion, an abom inable hydra which must be destroyed by a hundred invisible hands. It is necessary that philosophers course through the streets to destroy it. Let us crush the wretch!\" At one point in his life when he had an accident an d broke a blood vessel, he thought he was about to die and called a priest to whom he made confession and even signed a written confession in which he decried his evil life and asked God to forgive him. He went so far as to have this retraction printed in the newspapers. But as soon a s he had recovered, he"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"commenced his war against God with a new fury and d ied screaming imprecations against God and Christianity. Freemasonry spread the ideas taught by Voltaire. Th e first Lodge established in France was in 1727 under English obe dience. Its founder was a celebrated Jacobite named Lord Derwentwater. It was accepted almost immediately by the degenerate nobility who c lamored for membership. In a short time, Freemasons had lodges in every city of size Page 96 in Europe and England. Noted Christian leaders of t he Eighteenth century realized that the real secret of Freemasonry was th eir disbelief in the divinity of Jesus Christ and a determination to rep lace this truth with the doctrine of \"Naturalism\" and \"rationalism.\" There a re some authorities who believe that Oliver Cromwell was a follower of Socinus and that he introduced Masonry into England, calling them FREEMASONS for the first time and inventing the allegory of Solomon's Temple, now so much used by Freemasons everywhere. This temple, which w as destroyed by the Roman General Titus, in 70 A.D., in fulfillment of Christ's prophecy in Matt. 24:2 and Luke 19:43, 44 and in the Old Testament in Jeremiah 26:18 and Micah 3:12, was to be rebuilt by Freemasons. Freemasons planned to restore this temple after Chr istianity had been obliterated by the conspiratorial revolution. The s tatue of Nature, was the Hiram, whose murder Freemasonry was supposed to ave nge, and which previously, having removed Christ, was to resurrect Hiram by rebuilding the temple as it was before. The Talmudic-Cabalistic mind for centuries previous to the Reformation, had formed secret societies for their own protectio n and for the destruction of Christianity. As early as 1290, Edward I of England had banished the Jews, not because of their religion itself, but because of th e grave offenses on the part of the Jews, which endangered his realm. These acts were enacted against the Jews by His Parliament in 1290, with th e House of Commons playing a prominent role. In 1255, about 40 years after the Magna Charta was signed, Henry III ordered a trial in the murder of St. Hugh of Lincoln, who had been killed by \"Jewish ritualistic murder.\" Eighteen Jews were executed by the crown, after being proven guilty of this heinous crime."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" Page 97 In 1275, Parliament passed the \"Statute of Jewry,\" which confined the Jews to certain areas of the country, forbid them from practicing usury, or to own land, and requirud, hem to wear yellow ident ification badges. In 1290, Edward I, banished all Jews from England. The Baptist evangelist and author Hal Lindsay says this was done because t he Jews \"were God's Chosen people and Satan hated them.\" This seems to contradict the words of Jesus Himself, when He said to their leaders in John 8:44 - \"Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of y our father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, a nd abode not in the truth, because there is no truth i n him .\" Then in John 10:26, He told these same leaders: \"Ye believe not, BECAUSE YE ARE NOT OF MY SHEEP ... \" (Emphasis mine). This statement seems mighty clear to me! Even \"brainwashed\" Judeo-Christians should be able to un derstand the significance of these words. Without the Jewish conspiracy gnawing at their vita ls, England prospered for a time. Then in 1657, Oliver Cromwell, financed by the Jew Moses Caraja, came into power and the Jewish parasites we re allowed to return. It has been \"downhill\" for England ever since. In 1689, Amsterdam Jews financed the rebellion agai nst James II. The chief of these was Solomon Medina, who was also a high ranking member of Freemasonry. In 1694, the Bank of England was set up under Inter national Jewish control and the National Debt was instituted, secur ing for Jewish money lenders a first chance on the taxes of the English people, who paid for the interest on their loans. Sometimes this interest re ached the exorbitant rate of 250%. The right of the Crown to print money was transferred to the Bank of England, in much the same manner that this right was taken away from the American Congress and given to the Jewish owned Federal Reserve System in 1913. "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" Page 98 In 1707, economic and political union was forced on Scotland, against the vote of the Scottish people in every borough of the land and the National Debt of England became the National Debt of Scotlan d also. It was during this same period that the Jews took over economic c ontrol of Europe and Freemasonry began to thrive under their leadership. M. Gaugenot-Demousseaux, in his book, THE JEW. JUDAISM. AND THE JUDAIZATION OF THE CHRISTIAN PEOPLE (Paris, 1896) wrote: \"Masonry, that immense association, the rare initia tes of which, that is to say, the real chiefs of which, wh om we must be careful not to confound with the nominal ch iefs of the Blue Lodge, live in a strict and intimate allia nce with the militant members of Judaism ...

This phenomenon is accomplished, t hanks to the habits of rigorous discretion to which they subject themselves by oaths and terrible menaces, thanks al so to the majority of Jewish members which the mysterious constitution of Freemasonry seats in its sovereign council.\" What we are actually seeing in Freemasonry, is some thing like what has happened in the governments of England, Canada and the United States, and other nations of Christendom. In these countrie s, due to the \"terrible power of the purse,\" International Jewry now contro ls the economic life and politics of most of the Israelite nations. (The se, I believe, are the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, Scandinavian and related peo ples who make up that part of the world we call Christendom). It has been estimated by respected members of the U .S.

Voltarie learned that Masonry, which he had joined while living in London, was a capital means of spreading his doctri nes among courtiers, men of letters, and the general public of both Engl and and France. His major successes were in France. Operating under the guise of philanthropy and religion, few of the lower order members of Fre emasonry knew that it was anything more than a fraternal organization whi ch helped them in business and where they could obtain fellowship. A man named Ashmale, introduced the Bible into Free masonry along with the \"square and compass.\" These became important ac couterments of Masonry, which witnessed to the world that Masons b elieved in a god, whom they called THE GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE. This insignia featured an \"open eye,\" which they were to ld represented the \"all seeing eye of Providence. This eye, they were told, made it impossible for a Mason to escape his fate, if he ever revealed any secrets of the society or failed to obey orders he was selected to carry out. (It was on this basis alone, that I refused membership. I could not bring myself to pledge such allegiance to any man, or group of men.) In its secret conclaves and ascending degrees, it h ad means to tell the victim that the ARCHITECT meant a \"circle of nothin g!\" That the open Bible represented the \"universe;\" that the \"Square and compass\" were simply the fitness of things - the means to make al l men, \"fraternal, equal and free!\" But like Orson Wells' ANIMAL FARM they were not told that in Masonry, \"some pigs were more equal than others,\" a nd that the top Masons \"lord it over\" the Blue Lodge members and co ntrol not only their thinking, but their actions.

Page 101"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"12 - A CLOSER LOOK AT FREEMASONRY In the preface of his book FREEMASONRY - An Interpretation, Pastor Martin Wagner, Pastor of the St. John's Evangelical Lutheran church in Dayton, Ohio (1912) says: \"Real Freemasonry is something beside and beneath t he ritualistic forms and monitorial lectures. It is so mething which comparatively few Masons understand. Modern Masonry has never possessed the true key for the interpretation of the secret doctrines. This instit ution is esoteric. (Which means that its \"secrets\" are inten ded to be understood only by a few at the top). \"Masonic auth orities, as well as the Masonic ritual, declares that secret doctrine which constitutes the very essence of Freemasonry a nd which is veiled under terms and imagery of the buil der's craft. \"The essence of Freemasonry is that it's peculiar r eligious ideas and doctrines, have survived from the periods of remotest antiquity, until the present time ... crushed in one form, it will rise in another. Outlawed, or exposed in one institution, it evades detection by taking refuge u nder a different name, ritual, or symbolism.\" In its modern form and organization, Freemasonry ha s had a checkered career. So long as there is an unregenerate human n ature on this earth, so long will organizations such as the Freemasons find fertile ground in which to take root. Exposure may check it for a whi le and induce its adherents to repudiate it for a time. This was the case in 1826, when William Morgan, a Master Mason, published his exposure of the Mason ic Lodge. For this he was condemned by a Masonic encla ve and sentenced to death. When his murder was exposed by police invest igation, over 45,000 Masons in the United States left the Lodge, because they believed what Morgan had written, on the basis of what happened t o him. But Morgan had only divulged the form, the clothing if you wil l, the cloak under Page 102 which the real doctrine was concealed and veiled. F reemasonry on the European continent was scarcely effected by the Mor gan affair."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Exposure means little, unless one understands the k ey to Freemasonry. Most exposures by seceding Masons, exhibit only the trappings, the veneer, under which the true essence of Freemasonry is concealed. Not one Mason in ten thousand ever suspects what lies u nder the cloak of secrecy in which his lodge operates, for the real s ecrets of the Lodge are not taught in the Lodge. The majority of Masons see only the outward trappin gs of the Lodge and the less the Mason knows about them, the more he ad mires and believes. The same is true with the Judeo-Christian church, w here the vast majority of its members seldom if ever study the Scriptures on their own, preferring to be guided instead, by a pastor who has been as \" brainwashed\" as they. The same is true with Freemasonry, for when broken down to its common denominator, it is a religion. Religion is its myst ical tie! Religion has been from time immemorial, one of the most powerful fact ors in the activities of mankind. It has been the \"motor\" which has contr olled vast armies and founded world empires. It has been the force behind bloody revolutions and despotic governments. It has established despot ic \"priestcrafts\" and enforced obedience through fear generated by its te achings. Many times you will hear \"atheists\" and \"humanists\" accuse Christianity of being responsible for the bloody deaths of milli ons of people. This is not the case! True Christianity has never murdered innocent men, women and children! Religion has -churchianity has -but n ot true Christianity. A good example is the present conflict which has been going on for years in Lebanon, where so-called Christian forces have been battling the Moslems. Yet these are Christian in name only and s how none of the \"fruits of Page 103 the Spirit,\" which Scripture tells us are the mark of true Christians. In the name of religion, men have been enslaved to build lavish, costly monuments to its power; call these churches or cath edrals. These are shrines for the gods of religion. Not to God Almigh ty! Religion has never changed any man or woman into a better human being. When the Communist leader Lenin stated that \"Religion is the opiate of the people,\" he knew whereof he was speaking, for religion contr ols people and makes them slaves of the religious leaders. On the other hand, true Christianity has been respo nsible for our finest art; our sweetest music. It has transformed human perver ts from harden slave drivers to writers of Christian songs who could say : \"Just as I am, without"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"one plea, but that Thy blood was shed for me.\" It h as turned human devils of lust, fury and crime, into saints fit for the Ki ngdom of God. Christianity has given timid women and children the courage to face fear of being torn to bits by wild animals in a Roman ar ena. It has caused gentle women to withstand terrible torture for the sake of their beliefs. It has caused men to sing praises to God, as they were burned to death at the stake. (Read Fox's BOOK OF MARTYRS , and the 11th Chapter of Hebrews for an account of what Christianity has don e for men and women). Religion, on the other hand, has been the power beh ind political corruption; the power behind armies of evil kings a nd popes to destroy. Religion is the most powerful motor in mankind and religion is the driving engine in Freemasonry. We can see the modern applic ation of the power of religion, in the upsurge of Moslem Fundamentalis m, which could well sweep this world into World War III, as it comes up against the \"secular religion\" of the Zionists in Palestine. Page 104 The vital and essential elements in the religion of Freemasonry are not the spiritual facts and the spiritual mysteries. They a re carnal and physical, what some would call \"the facts of life.\" These are the \"mysteries\" involved in \"generation\" and \"reproduction,\" which Masons worship. The same \"regenerative power\" which has been worshipped for millennia by heathen people around the world. Because of heir \"e arthy\" nature, they appeal to the lustful spirit of unregenerate men. These \"mysteries\" relate to the dominate passion of man to \"procreate.\" They excite his passion, awaken his emotions, take first place in his mind and energize his deepest thoughts. It is difficult to conceive of anything more exquis itely fitted to appeal to the \"natural,\" the \"animalistic\" man of the evoluti onists, than the teachings of Freemasonry. It is a religion which makes the my stery of procreation, the hidden force on which it rests. Masonry conceives of the divine nature as residing in man, and this nature is best expressed through sexual passion. The grati fication of this passion, therefore, is pleasing to the Masonic god and becom es his duty. Although he may claim to be a Christian - and many of its me mbers do -he has given"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"his allegiance to \"another false Christ\" who repudi ates the New Testament teachings regarding \"unlawful lust\" and \"illicit pa ssion.\" Our Lord's admonition to men in Matthew 5:28 - \"But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her , hath already committed adultery with her in his heart ... is looked on by the Mason as the height of utter stupidity! Christians are further admonished in Galatians 5:16 - Walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.\" Again in James 1:14 - \"But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of HIS O WN LUST, and Page 105 enticed. Then when LUST has conceived, it bringeth forth sin (transgression of God's law, according to 1 John 3:4), and sin, when it is finished bringeth forth death.\" (Both physical and spiritual.) And finally in James 4:1 - From whence come wars and fightings among you? com e they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?\" But the god of Freemasonry contradicts the Scriptur al account and shouts: \"NOT SO! It is your sacred duty to seek self-gratif ication! It is your moral and religious duty to fulfill the lusts of the fles h!\" This is one of the reasons so many men want to become Masons, it is a religion which caters to the sensuality of men. It does to men, what the Woman's Liberation Movement has done to women, when they tell their ad herents : \"Don't listen to those narrow-minded Christians. You've co me a long way baby! No one can tell you what you can do with your own b ody!\" Freemasonry appeals to the unregenerate heart of me n, because the \"generation\" of human beings is the great work of M asons and is what they call: \"Building a temple for the indwelling of the GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE,\" who is not the God of t he Christian. Today, as never before, a persistent war is being w aged, either directly or indirectly against Christian principles which have been the strong foundation of our white, Christian civilization. Th ese are the principles which have freed the slaves; have fed the hungry; h ave carried the Gospel of Jesus Christ around the world, and which have bu ilt Christian Constitutions on the Word of God. It is what has br ought prosperity, freedom, and relative happiness to more people, in a shorter period of time, than any other principle which has ever been practiced on this earth."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"As part of any attack against Christianity, there m ust be an attack against the Christian family and Masonry has Page 106 followed this path. Many times governments refuse t o see the indivisible, fundamental value of the Christian family and try a nd take over its prerogatives. This always leads to chaos, confusion and destruction to Christian values. Along with this attack, comes the attack on the right of the individual to own private property; the right o f the individual to protect himself and his family; the right of freedom of spe ech, press, and religion. From time immemorial, our European ancestors have l ooked on these as the prime basis for their society. Today, the natural organization of labor, which has been founded on the mutual need between capital and labor and which has been traditional in all periods of recorded history, has been upset. No w the worker is proclaimed to be equal in all respects with his emp loyer, while he is exempted from the duties and responsibilities of th e employer. The result has been a senseless \"class struggle\" which has all but destroyed American industry and which was designed to do just that. According to both English and European Freemason le aders, Masonry was defined as; 'fa peculiar system of morality, revealed in allegory a nd illustrated by symbols.\" THE UNIVERSAL MANUAL OF FREEMASONRY, describes Masonry as: \"the activities of closely related men, who, employ ing symbolic forms borrowed principally from the builde rs art and from architecture, work for the welfare of mank ind, striving morally to enable themselves and others to thereby bring about a universal league (One-World Governmen t) of mankind ... \" Freemasonry is in the forefront of the One-World Mo vement. In the Christian concept of society, morals as well as soc ial rights and duties must be based on man's revelation of God and his du ty to obey God's law. In Masonry, the idea of human virtue and morality, is independent of God, and Divine law is ignored if it conflicts with the issues promulgated by Masonry.

Because of the policy of deception practiced by Mas onic leaders, it is difficult to analyze accurately the underlying esse nce of Freemasonry. Essentially, it is founded on Jewish \"Pantheism,\" or the 'deification and worship of unregenerate man, rather than God.\" It reflects the words of the German Jewish philosopher of the Eighteenth Cen tury, Ludwig Feubrach, when he said: \"Man will finally be truly free, when he realizes t here is no god of man, but man himself.\" This is the underlying belief of atheistic communis m Most of Masonic symbolism, in its original and prop er meaning, refers to \"phallic worship.\" This fact is openly testified to by such Masonic leaders as Albert Pike, Mackey, Thomas, Webb Smith, William Preston and Hutchins on. Rogan, a Masonic author of some note states that th e Masonic god is the god of the pyramids, thus identifying Masonry with the ancient Egyptian religions. The first three degrees of the order - those of App rentice, Fellow Craft (or Companion Mason), and Master Mason, are known as sy mbolic degrees. The candidate is admitted through a series of fanta stic ceremonies ... the significance of which is not revealed to the initia te. He learns nothing but the symbols and sacred words. He is continually edi fied by allusions to God and the Bible, the hidden meanings of which are withheld from him until he reaches the higher degrees. It is not until a member reaches the 33 o in the ANCIENT SCOTTISH RITE, that of Sovereign Grand-Inspector, that the genuine mysteries of Freemasonry are explained. In his first initiation stages he learns: Page 108 1. - That the rite of initiation for Apprentice Mas ons represents in dramatic fashion the origin or birth of Nature's god - the G REAT ALL. It signifies the non-existence of a super-natural person God, su ch as that of Christianity. It signifies that the two principles of ''matter'' and \"form\""},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"\"male\" and \"female,\" are always eternally \"generati ng,\" (reproducing). It looks on God as a hermaphrodite, and creation as th e beginning of the \"generation process.\" 1 2. - The initiation rite into the Second Degree, re presents the moral condition of nature's god, always in labor, always reproducing. Again it looks on God as hermaphroditic, and states that his name JEHOVAH, means \"generation.\" Meaning to say, HE-SHE, the two sexes in one. 2 The dual principle of \"male\" and \"female\" is repres ented by the \"square and compass.\" The \"compass\" represents OSIRIS, the male god of the Egyptians, while the \"square\" is the symbol represe nting ISIS, the female goddess of Egypt - both are sexual symbols. 3 3. - The initiation to the Third DEGREE OR MASTER MASON DEGREE, introduces the initiate to the story of Hiram Abiff , one of the architects of Solomon's Temple, as related in the TARGUM. (One of the several translations of Jewish scriptures, written in the v ernacular (Aramaic) language of ancient Judea.) Hiram is recorded as an allegorical being, symboliz ing the GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE. (Mackey, pp. 13-99). In this rite, the process of \"generation\" is represented as being com plete; God, and the name of God, which the candidates are supposed to b e seeking, is Notes:- 1.

This is explained as the man-child coming into being through the union of the SUN, with his daught er, the EARTH. 4 This deity is also known as MAC-BENEC, \"Offspring of put refaction,\" since death and decomposition must precede the beginning of life; the seed must die before the plant can live. 5 "},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"\"This,\" says the Masonic expert Ragon, \"is the impo rtant phenomenon, the ineffable mystery, the key to nature, which the anc ient sages succeeded in discovering, and which they adopted as the basis of Masonic doctrine ...

Throughout his b ook on Freemasonry, Ragon dwells on the process of procreation, Isis, E gyptian gods and goddesses, etc. I believe enough has been said to indicate the \"ear thy\" nature of Freemasonry and their peculiar system of morality, which we will discuss later on. All this is in veiled allegory. The contr ast between Scriptural morality and Masonic morality is that between \"ligh t\" and darkness;\" between the \"spirit of the anti-Christ\" and the \"sp irit of God.\" It was Jesus who said: \" ... men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil,\" (John 3:19). He went on in verse 20 to say: \"Everyone Notes:- 4. See: Ragon, Tyileur General Dc La Franc-Maconnerie, p.28. 5. This principle is taught in Mackey's Lexicon on Masonry.

They may cal l themselves Christian, but as Christ Himself said: Matthew 6:24; Luke 16:13. \"No man can serve two masters; for either he will h ate the one and love the other; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other; ye cannot serve God and MAMMON.\" Mammon is the love of fleshly, material things.

According to Albert Pike, in his MORALS AND DOGMA \"Almost every one of the ancient Masonic symbols ha d four distinct meanings, one, as it were within the other - the mo ral, the political, the philosophical, and the spiritual meaning.\" Thus, according to Pike; Hiram Abiff, Christ and MO LAY, are regarded as symbols representing \"humanity.\" Since they are all apostles of \"liberty, equality and fraternity.\" (These, by the way, were the watchword of the atheistic French Revolution). The cross in Freemaso nry is by no means looked on as a specific Christian symbol, but is cl osely connected with a peculiar cult. The I.N.R.I. on the cross, to a Maso n, does not refer to the passion of our Lord, but is Masonically read as \"Igne Natura Rebovatur Integra,\" or \"All nature is renewed by Masonic fire.\" The picture of Christ dying on the cross for the si ns of mankind becomes for the Masons, the \"greatest among the apostles of humanity, braving Roman despotism, and the fanaticism and bigotry of the priesthood.\" Page 111 Reading from official Masonic documents, one can re adily see that the vast majority of the Masonic Brotherhood, does not understand the trend or purpose of Masonic teachings and activity. They are instructed by slow degrees and are only ad mitted into the more secret of the degrees, as they have become morally attuned to Masonic teachings and thus become capable of understanding the higher degrees. Albert Pike, in MORALS AND DOGMA , p.819 says: \"Part of the symbols, are displayed ... to the initiated, but he is intentionally led astray by false interp\">1 ... Masonry conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts (Hi ghly skilled experts of Masonry), the Sages and the Elec t; and uses false explanations for its symbols to mislead those deserving to be misled.\" So you can see, from this top Masonic leader, that Masonry is a system of falsehood, which is used to fool even their own mem bers."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"The character of the inner workings of Freemasonry, is one of the reasons its secrets are hidden behind horrible oaths, which bind its votaries, especially in the higher degrees, through fear. If the eminent Masonic authorities declare that few members understand the mysteries of Masonry, you should not consider i t presumptuous if I say that very few Masons are ever brought to a true und erstanding of the organization they support. If they were decent men, and this is especially true of those who claim to be Christian, they would resign in disgust in spite of the horrible oaths they have taken. Many Masons fail to see the truth because of the us e of the Bible in their ceremonies. They see the garment of HIDDEN POWER - Masonry, but not what it conceals. They get little or no spiritu al inspiration from the Lodge, Page 112 but appear in its dress parades and feast at its ba nquets, thinking they are engaged in a harmless fraternity which is doing goo d in the community and is good for their business. But in most cases, in fact, in a large majority of cases, there is a vast difference betwe en what Masonry teaches and what it believes.

It employs the terms of regenerati on; illumination; resurrection; justification and other Christian ide as, under which hide Masonic religious operations. These terms have a pe culiar and specific meaning to Masons, and in studying this institution , we must not permit ourselves to be misled by their use of Christian th eological terms.

It may be difficult for the average Canadian or Ame rican to understand the tremendous influence exerted by Freemasonry on our respective countries. The vast majority of Masons in both countries are l aw abiding citizens; many of them are church members, active in the reli gious activities of their community; many are conspicuous in charitable efforts to help the unfortunate and are looked on as pillars of stabili ty in the community. But we need to remember that most of these Masons have been \"brainwashed,\" just as members of the Judeo-Christian churches hav e been. In the church, these Christians, both Masonic and Judeo-Christian, protect the very enemies which are seeking to destroy everything the y say they believe in as Patriotic Christians. Professor John Robinson, a high ranking English Mason, wrote a very revealing book - PROOFS OF A CONSPIRACY (1798).

This contrariness rises from their completely different concept of life. While few Jews were visible in the French Revolutio n of 1798, Freemasons did the job for them and were a cloak of secrecy shrouding Jewish involvement. Often, where Freemasonry is act ive, the Jews who manipulate them will remain in the background. This caused the Jewish Prime Minister of England, Benjamin Disraeli (1868- 1880) to say: \"The world is governed by very different personages to what is imagined by those who are not behind the sc enes...

In 1919, when Leon Trotsky, with $20-million donated by Jewish ba nker Jacob Schiff of New York, was on his way to Europe, he had with him 247 Jews who were the \"dregs of society\" from the alleys of New York City.

In Russia, where Freemasonry had been forbidden by law, the revolutionary effort was about 90% Jewish and many of these were Masons. The scum which followed them was eager for plunder.

When the Hungarian Soviet Re public was"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"established on March 22, 1918, its top leaders were 100% Freemasons and Jews.

Men with name s such Page 118 as Liebrenecht, Rosa Luxemborough, Kurt Einser, and others. When the Imperial Government of Germany fell at the end of World War I, Jews and Masons dominated the new government. Th e eleven men who took power over Bavaria were Lowenberg, Dr. Kurt Ro senfeld, Caspar Wallheim, Max Rothschild, Karl Arnold, Konrald, Ros enheh, Bierbaum, Reis, and Kaiser. These, along with Kurt Eisner von Israelovich, were the head of the Revolutionary Tribunal. All were Jews, and all were FREEMASONS, belonging to Lodge #11 in Munich. A strange phenomenon exists in Judaism, in that eno rmous amounts of labor and money have been expended to minimize the part played by Jews in the Bolshevik Revolution, while at the same time , world renowned Jewish leaders brag about the power they exert.

I have previously mentioned THE PROTOCOLS OF THE LEARNED ELDERS OF ZION , which the Jews and their Christian stooges proclaim as counterfeit. But the indisputable fact remains, that from as early as 1789, this Machiavellian plan for world control has been used successfully around the world and Jews and Freemasons are follow ing its plan like a \"blueprint.\" One French Socialist leader stated: \"The nation is a great herd that only thinks of bro wsing, and with good sheep dogs (police) and shepherds (political and re ligious leaders), can lead as they please ...

But what about now? Has it mellowed? Has its designs changed?

The truth is, that Freemasonry is in a generic (applied to a class or group), Page 121 simply a system of binding men together for a given purpose. The allegories (description of one thing under the image of another), used in Freemasonry, are capable of various interpretati ons. The re-building of Solomon's Temple for instance, may refer to progres s in any Masonic undertaking. The same is true about its \"sacred tra ditions.\" This system of degrees, of initiations, of binding members to secr ecy by fearful oaths, can be employed for any purpose, social, political, phi lanthropic, or religious. It can promote \"good,\" or disseminate \"evil.\" It ca n be used to \"defend a concept,\" or \"overthrow\" it; it can \"protect\" or \"d estroy.\" But unfortunately, in Grand Orient Masonry, we find that it is not only political in its aims, it is also subversive. Inste ad of a peaceful trilogy of \"brotherly love, relief and truth,\" it has added fr om its beginning, the war cry of revolution: \"Liberty, Equality and Fraternit y,\" which can never come to pass on this earth as long as it is control led by human beings. The aim of Grand Orient Masonry, from its inception , has been to bring about \"universal equality.\" In the matter of \"liber ty,\" they preach: \"no man shall have a master\" and echo the thoughts of the G erman Jew Feurbach who stated that: \"Man will finally be free, when he realizes there i s no god of man, but man himself\" To believe this falsehood, a man must first divorce himself from any concept of Christianity wh ich teaches that Jesus is King! The Grand Orient Lodge attacks all forms of religio n.

Our LORD clearly taught this in John 5:46, 47, when He told the Jewish leaders: 46 \"For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believ ed me; for he wrote of me. 47 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye be lieve my words?\" Michael Rodkinsom, the Jewish author and translator of the TALMUD from Hebrew to English, in his preface to the trans lation says: \"The modern Jew is a product of the Talmud.\" Yet it is interesting to note that the Talmud releg ates the TORAH (the teachings of Moses) to a second place in Jewish tea ching. The TALMUD is not a \"law of righteousness\" for all mankind, as the Bible is, but is a strict code which applies only to Jews. You will no t find admonitions in it, such as those found in Micah 6:8 - \"He (God) hath shown thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of the e, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God. \" In the TALMUD the ideas of Justice, equity and char ity towards one's neighbor, depend on whether you are a Jew or not. I n fact, the TALMUD expressly forbids a Jew to save a non-Jew from deat h, or to restore lost goods to him, or to have pity on him in any way. Ho w can you deal justly with your neighbor, when your religion teaches you that he is a \"goyim\" (non-Jew animal)? According to the TALMUD volume Schulchan Aruch, Cho szen Hamiszpat (238): 'A Jew is permitted to rape, cheat and perjure hims elf; but he must take care that he is Page 123 not found out, so that his people suffer.\" This teaching is almost identical to the teachings of FREEMASONRY According to volume Sulchan Aruch, Choszen Hamispat (348): \"All property of other nations belongs to the Jews, who are consequently entitled to seize upon it without scruples. An orth odox Jew is not bound to observe principles of morality, if profitable to hi mself or to Jews in general.\""},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Volume Baba Mechia (108b) and the JEWISH ENCYCLOPEDIA, both state: \"Only Jews are men... Gentiles (non-Jews) are not c lassed as men but as barbarians or beasts.\" In Volume Bab Khama IV , (3) we read: \"if a Gentile sues a Jew the verdict is for the defendant; if the Jew is the pla intiff he obtains full damages.\" This is almost the same reaction we find when a Mas on goes to court against a non-Mason. In Volume Sanhedrin (954b) we learn that \"Pederasty (sex relations between men and boys) with a child below the age of nine years is not deemed as pederasty with a child. If one commits so domy with a child of lesser age, no guilt is incurred.\" There are many more bestial and obscene comments, s ome of which cannot be placed in a book such as this. It is easy to see where the moral teachings of Freemasonry and Judaism come from. It is from this same devilish source. In the CABALA, even more than in the TALMUD, the Je wish dream of world domination reoccurs over and over again. Alth ough Christian apologists for the Jews, laugh and scorn at the ide a of a Jewish conspiracy to control the world, yet Jewish leaders talk about it constantly and brag about the progress they have made towards this goal . It is a constant theme in Jewish religious books. This message of world conquest is not the message t aught by the Israel prophets, who were not Jews, by the way, but Israel ites. Page 124 The task of true Israelites is not to control the w orld, but. in the words of the Apostle Peter \"to shew forth the praises of Him (Christ) who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light .\" The task of \"true Israel\" is to be God's ambassadors, not some dictator, who like the Jew, desires to have 2,000 \"goyim\" slaves who wait on hi m hand and foot. In the TALMUD Volume Baba Batra (74b) and in at least three other volumes, the story is told of what will happen when the Jewish Messiah comes back to rule the world. It is completely diff erent from the much more plausible story told in the Bible, regarding C hrist's return. According to the TALMUD version, the Jews will be entertained at a great banquet. They will be seated at golden tables and will be se rved wine from Adam's"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"cellar. Their banquet meal will be made up of a roa sted ox called BEHEMOTH which is so huge that it eats the grass of f a thousand hills every day. There will also be a monster fish called LEVIATHAN which will be broiled and pickled. A gigantic fowl known as BAYUCHF will also be served. This bird is so large, that when on e of its eggs fell out of a nest, it crushed 300 large cedar trees and the whit e from its broken shell, flooded sixty villages. (This sounds almost as fant astic as some of the stories Jews tell about the HOLOCAUST). The final c ourse of this immense banquet will consist of dessert, including fruit from the 'tree of life,' and pomegranates from the Garden of Eden.\" ( Again, this story sounds almost like some of the stories one hears in the Judeo-Christian churches regarding heaven.) An 18th Century Jewish commentator named Stehlin st ates that, \"foreigners (that's you and I, brother) will till t he ground of the Jews in that day of their triumph; that we (foreigners) wil l build their houses and cities and plant their vineyards, all without pay, because it will be such an honor for us to work for them. The nations which su rvive the last 'holocaust' will offer the Jews all their wealth an d Gentile princes and princesses will wait on Jews as their slaves, and Page 125 be ready at the nod of a head, to do anything the J ew asks.\" That sounds like \"LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND FRATERNITY!\" now doesn 't it? The hope of world domination - \"world conspiracy,\" if you will, is as strong now in the Jewish mind as it has been for 2, 000 years, and is being aided and abetted by Masons of high rank. The real dream of Jewish world power can be seen most clearly in the Cabala. About the only way the modern Jew relates to the Bi ble, is in his arrogant statements concerning the \"Ten Commandments, which WE gave to mankind.\" It is this type of arrogance, which cause d the translators of the New Testament to translate John 4:22 , as having Jesus say: \"salvation is of the Jews,\" when any clear thinking Christian knows that salvat ion does not come through any nation, or group of people, bu t only through God's Son, Jesus the Christ. It is this Jewish arrogance which caused them to change the original, which said: \"For salvation cometh out of Judea.\" This makes sense, the KJV translation does not!

Instead of heeding what their Mast er said, they call His enemies, \"God's Chosen people\" and support the very ones who are attempting to destroy them. What fools men be! The Jews have always bragged about their privileged status with God, knowing full well that they are the impostors who a re spoken of in Malachi 1:2-4 and Revelation 2:9; 3:9. When people brag about their Page 126 privileged status, they will always be met with res entment. That is one reason the Apostle Paul said they are \"contrary to all men, \" ( 1 Thess. 2:5 ). To represent the Jewish people as a gentle, sufferi ng people, the victims of gentile persecution, is to show an entire lack of b oth spiritual and historical understanding. In the ages past, Jews ha ve over and over again showed their utter contempt for all mankind and tha t they are capable of the utmost cruelties towards those who disagree wit h them, especially if they are the hated Nazarites (Christians). Most of the cruelest persecutions in the Communist regimes, have been carried out und er Jewish supervision. An estimated 140-million people have b een murdered by these minions of Judeo-Masonry. Today, the cruelty of Jews towards the Palestinians, whose land they have wrongfully usurp ed, goes far beyond anything that Hitler ever dreamed. The Jewish historian, Josephus, in his monumental work titled THE JEWISH WARS , describes the pogroms carried out by the Jews in Palestine during the First Century A.D. The \"Sicarr i,\" were a band of Jewish terrorists, who were working with the approv al of the Jewish authorities, much as the MOSSAD works today. Many C hristians do not know that the Jewish leaders Begin and Shamir, were leading terrorists in 1948. During the First Century, these terrorists wi ped out a village called Engeddim, killing over 700 women and children. In 1 948, Menachem Begin, another Jew terrorist, wiped out a Palestini an village of some 264 old men, women and children and bragged that he had killed Arab women with his own hands. Yet this terrorist became Prime Minister of Israeli."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"It is intellectual dishonesty of the worst sort to state, as the prostitutes of Judaism do, from their pulpits, that the faults of the modern Jews are due to their persecution at the hands of Christians in the past.

They were persecuted because of the ir crooked, immoral dealings in every country which gave them refuge. T oday, that same resentment is building up in Canada and the United States, as we see them taking full advantage of Christian hospitality, whi le attempting to destroy everything we stand for as Christians. The day of r eckoning will come here, as it has in other countries. It is inevitabl e, unless Jewish leaders come to their senses and put a \"check rein\" on thei r activists. Some idea of why cruelty is the norm for these peop le can be seen in a mode of execution suggested by the TALMUD. In the V olume Sanhedrin, a method of execution was to wrap a scarf around th e neck of the victim, tightening it from both ends until his mouth was fo rced open. Then a lighted fuse was forced down his throat to burn out his entrails. This is very similar to some of the \"blood thirsty\" oaths w hich Masons are forced to take. It is interesting in the light of these TALMUDIC teachings, to see that the liberal Jew is in the forefront of the fig ht against Capital Punishment, declaring it to be a \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" It is also interesting to note the number of Jewish women who are in the forefront of the Women's Liberation Movement, the L esbian Movement, N.O.W., and Pro-Abortion. Yet the Talmudic religion is definitely \"anti- woman.\" A good example of this is the daily Jewish prayer, where the Jewish man says: \"Blessed by thou, O Lord our God, king of the Unive rse, that thou hast not made me a woman. We must never forget, when we look at Judaism, that no matter what the Jewish Rabbis may say at Inter-Faith meetings, Rabb inical Judaism is the bitter enemy of Christianity.

Yet our stupid \"goyim Chr istian sheep,\" still call these people, God's Chosen! The feelings of the Jew, even those who profess Chr istianity, can be seen in the actions of a Jewish pastor of an Assembly of God Church in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida. Pastor Harvey Koelner, a Jew, claims to be a \"born-again\" Christian. Yet he has written several pamphlets, with the Assembly of God logo on them, which are distinctly anti-Christian. One is, Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and Jesus . In this tract he says: \"Now comes the hoax of all hoaxes (guess he never heard of the Jewish HOLOHOAX, the story of Jesus. There is absolutely n o piece of physical evidence on earth that can prove that Jesus existed . There is no historical evidence that he existed.\" Yet this man, calls hims elf a Christian minister. A Jewish group in Washington State, called the ABELARDREUCHLIN FOUNDATION, recently wrote to me: \"There is solid proven documentation which proves that the story of Jesus is false. It was a fictional story created by Flavius Joseph us and th e Romans. The inner circle of Christian clergymen know this is true.\" (I was in this \"inner circle\" for many years and I never heard a breath o f rumor about this Jewish fable.) A Jewish writer in Hollywood by the name of Hecht, said: \"The Jews made a mistake when they crucified Jesus. I would h ave sent him to Rome to be fed to the lions. The Christians would have a hard time making a Savior out of mincemeat.\" Another Jewish leader said: \"The Jewish religion is reserved for only people of quality and excellence, those of superior intelligence, who operate on a higher plane than Page 129 other people. You must realize that most Jewish peo ple are more intelligent, better educated, and more successful t han Christians,\" With this kind of arrogance, you can readily understand why Jews are universally detested.

No more scathing denunciation of the Jewish religion can be found anywhere, than this which came direct from the Son of God. When Pastor Sheldon Emry, of the Lord's Covenant Ch urch in Phoenix, Arizona, died from cancer a few years ago; his assi stant pastor, Ben Williams, received this letter from a Jew: Dear Pastor Williams: \"Congratulations on the death of Christian Nazi She ldon Emry, We (Jews) prayed to the G-d of Israel (Jews) for a painful and agonizing death for this Nazi scum, and G-d answered our prayers.

Anyone who knew Pastor Emry, and he was a close and valued friend of mine, knew him for a dedicated Christian Patriot, w ho was hated by the Zionists because he told the truth about them.

It is interesting to me, to note that it is the Jew s who are in the forefront of every effort to enforce so-called \"hate laws,\" in C anada and the United States, yet they are also in the forefront of dispe nsing hate towards Christians. These laws, such as the ones now in exi stence in Canada, protect the Jews and minorities from hateful remark s, but cannot and will not be use to defend Christians.

The sad thing is, this virulent hatred of everythin g that has to do with Jesus Christ, reaches into every organization which is touched by Judaism, including the Freemason Lodge and the Judeo-Christi an church. Be honest with yourself and ask this question: \"What is so aw ful about being anti- Jewish, when they openly brag of their hatred for o ur King and how they mean to destroy us?\" Do you honestly believe these enemies of our Lord should be allowed to openly blaspheme His name and ridicule His church, and destroy our Christian beliefs, just because the y have proclaimed themselves to be God's Chosen People? In Malachi 1:4 , we read these words from the LORD God JEHOVAH! - \"Whereas Edom (the Jews) saith, We are impoverisbed , but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they (Israel) sha ll call them (the Jews), The Border of wickedness, and the people against wh om the LORD bath indignation (anger) forever.\" LINE OF REASONING USED BY JEWS AGAINST CHRISTIANITY There are three major lines of reasoning used by Ju daism in their fight against Christ and Christianity.

This idea will not stand up under the search light of recorded history. 2.- That Christ was nothing more than a great teach er and that He should be classified alongside Buddha, Mohammed, Confucius, etc. 3.- That Christ was a crazy fanatic, who was carrie d away by his visions of being the prophesied Messiah.

While others, such as the writer of the movie, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST , pictured Him as not only crazy, but a lecher. In reality, down through the ages, true Christianit y has been the greatest protector of the Jews. I do not refer to \"churchian ity\" here, since there is a great deal of difference. In Canada and the U.S., t he \"Jews are the Chosen People Myth\" has become so deeply embedded in most evangelical and fundamental churches, that the pastors and people b elieve God's promises made to Abraham in Genesis 12:3 - \"I will bless them that blesses thee, and curse him that curseth thee, \"can be applied to the people we know as Jews today. Yet the modern Jew is the perfect example of the an ti-Christ defined very clearly in 1 John 2:22,23. In spite of this, the \"brainwashed\" Christians of the Judeo-Christian churches, completely overlook t he Scripture warning of 2 Chronicles 19:2 - \" ... Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee fr om before the LORD.\" Page 133 There were no people named Jews on this planet when God made His promise to Abraham and if you look at it very close ly and objectively, it says nothing about these blessings and curses being handed down to his descendants. The people we know as Jews are first m entioned in the Bible, in 2 Kings 16:6, almost 1200 years after the time of Abraham, where we find them fighting against Israel. The theory of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, suppor ted by Freemasonry, does not rest on the evidence of such question able documents as PROTOCOLS (although world Jewry is following them like a \"blueprint\"). In PROTOCOL IX , we read: \"The words of the liberal, are in effect our watchw ord - LIBERTY! EQUALITY! FRATERNITY! (Strangely enough they are the \"watchword\" of world Freemasonr y too).

What Christian Americans and Canadians, including the members of t he Lodges of Freemasonry, have been taught, is to \"tolerate the intolerances\" of Judaism, since there are no more intolerant and pre judicial people anywhere on earth, than the Zionist Jews.

I do not support this thesis in any way! Personally, I am \"fed up\" with the Jewish and Judeo -Christian allegations that even to discuss the Jewish question is unfair and will be punished by God. Jews do not hesitate to criticize Christians, even those who support them. In fact, they often speak with sarcasm regard ing the \"Christian sheeple,\" they have so blatantly \"hoodwinked,\" and who they lead around by the nose.

I am not being anti- Semitic when I tell you the truth about self-announ ced Jewish plans to destroy you, any more than I was anti-German, when I fought against the Nazi during World War II, fooled as I was by the Je wish propaganda of World War II, just as were 95% of the veterans who fought that war; but we were not \"anti-German.\" Here is a \"fact of life\" that Freemasons around the world need to take into account; it is found in PROTOCOL XV : Page 135 \"When we (Jews) come into our kingdom through coups de'etat (violent overthrow of existing governments), we will make it our task to destroy every institution of secret societies, whose member s will be punished by death. MOST OF THEM ARE KNOWN TO US, SINCE THEY HAV E WORKED FOR US.\" (Emphasis mine). In every country on this earth, where Talmudic Comm unism has taken control, this has been their pattern of action.

You can imagine what would happen to an Identity Christian, who would be stupid enough to m ake a similar remark in public. He would have the Federal Government on his back, \"like a hawk on a June bug.\" The California District attorn ey who attempted to prosecute this case, in which Rubin was released, s aid: \"The framers of the American Constitution would turn over in their grav es if they could see the manner in which the First Amendment is being us ed to protect people who offer 'blood money' for the elimination of thos e they don't like.\" Page 136 Recent police reports from the East, show that in a t least 2/3 of all cases where vandalism of synagogues or Jewish cemeteries occur, there are Jews involved. The JDL delights in efforts such as this, since it keeps their people \"stirred up; full of hate, and ready to cont ribute to any cause the JDL desires.\" This is identical to the process used in Freemasonry, where the lower degrees obey, because of fear and ignoran ce.

Curiously enough, when Stalin invaded the Bal tic states, the western press did not consider this as an invasion, it was called \"liberation of Western Ukraine.\" (West Ukrainians have yet to be c onvinced of this). At the Yalta Conference, a dying American President, controlled by his Communist advisor Alger Hiss, and a vacillating dru nkard of a British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, sold out all of Eastern Europe to the murderer from Russia. In fact, they handed this are a to Stalin \"on a platter,\" possibly as a reward for his having exter minated 15,000 Polish officers at the Katyn Forest Massacre. While attending the Yalta Conference, Winston Churc hill, accompanied by his equally alcoholic daughter, was treated to f requent excursions of the numerous Crimean wineries liberated by the KGB. He was hardly ever sober, according to eye witness accounts. Having pr ostituted himself at Yalta, he later went on to speechify, with great \"c rocodile tears\" in his bloodshot eyes, about the \"Iron Curtain\" which had descended over Eastern Europe. Being a Freemason, as well as an agent of the riche st Jewish financiers, Churchill, like Franklin Roosevelt, did everything possible to instigate the world war, and drag the United States into it and l ater on, to arm Stalin's legions to the teeth to assure victory. It was duri ng the early days of 1942- 43, when American troops were dying on the atolls o f the Pacific for lack of military supplies, that we were sending the Russ ians $11-billion in Lend Lease, with priority of shipment to the Commun ists. This was one of the reasons that Rudolf Hess, who was I believe a sincere messenger for peace, was kept incommunicado for the Page 140 duration of the war. If the British people had been allowed to hear what Hess had to say, the war could have been over by th e end of 1943. It is strange to see how Churchill vacillated in his inte ntions towards Germany. In 1933, on the wake of Hitler's being appointed Ch ancellor of the Reich, Churchill spoke with admiration of \"Germany's splen did clear-eyed youth, burning to die for their fatherland.\" At that time his interests lay with Germany. But when he was hired secretly, as an agen t of influence for the Board of Deputies of British Zionists, he started g oing on about the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"\"Huns\" and the \"Barbarians\" who were ruling Germany . He was a perfect example of a \"double-minded man,\" and the Apostle James says of such: \"A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways\" (James 1:8 ). Having stormed into the Judeo-Masonic trap of the A nglo-French \"guarantees\" to Poland, which were laid for him in 1939, Hitler would have certainly crashed through, if it had not been for the machinations of this Masonic drunkard from England. Hitler soon found himself at war, not only with his old enemy from Russia, but with Britain, the old bastion of the Gr and Orient Lodge of Freemasonry and with the United States which had be come the Judeo- Masonic \"arsenal of democracy.\" In the late 1930's the Soviet Union was described b y many noted historians as the \"colossus on feet of clay.\" Most of its infantry soldiers had never seen a semi-automatic rifle. All of its p lywood and canvas covered aircraft were almost as useless in the air as they were on the ground - it was on the ground where the Soviet Air force was almost wiped out on the opening day of the war. Most of th eir tanks would not move and the mechanics knew little about their upke ep. It was only the Russian winter, which kept Hitler from overrunning Page 141 Moscow and ending once and for all, for all time, t he Communist-Masonic danger to the world. But it was not to be. This is when the \"Evil Empire\" was at its weakest, and when the Judeo-Masonic forc es set out to bolster her. One wonders where the \"latter day fire-and-bri mstone\" anti- communists were in those days. Ronald Reagan, for e xample, was a class B movie player in Jew-run Hollywood, and a register ed Democrat no less. Hitler, who was a self-confessed admirer of Great B ritain, never sought a war with the West. That is why he allowed the defea ted British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk to slip across the c hannel. Instead of subjecting them to humiliating surrender, or hopele ss massacre, Hitler's naive racial sentiments concerning \"Aryan Brotherho od\" made him blind to the fact that its destruction would have possibl y saved the war for Germany. Of course the Judeo-Masonic rulers of Brit ain - its mercenary middle-class, its tainted low-degree Masons include d, were always \"replaceable resources,\" for the alcoholic Churchil l and his ambitions to please his Zionist masters."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The drunkard prime minister of England, became the greatest undertaker of all times, as he sacrificed millions of his peop le, in order to win the praise and backing of his Jewish masters.

The same evil prominence was obtained by Jews during the period o f terror during which Bela Kuhn ruled Hungry. The sam e phenomenon has been allowed to prey upon the tempor ary prostration of the German people ...

The dissolution of Freemasonry, the expropriation of the parasitic Jew ish finance capital in Germany by the National-Socialist government and th e newly-won economic independence from the international usurer s-bankers put the whole of Germany on the Judeo-Masonic \"hit list.\" Page 143 The all too noticeable prosperity of the German peo ple under the new populist government was bad news for the usurers; a nd President Roosevelt came from a long line of bankers and Stoc k Exchange crooks to whom a government \"of the people, by the people, an d for the people\" was bad for business. As far back as September 1938, Ha rold L. Ickes, FDR's Secretary of the Interior asked Roosevelt: \"Is this Munich crisis good or bad for us in the United States?\" According to Icke s private diary, Sept. 13, 1938, Roosevelt replied: \"Every European nation is going to have to buy guns and arms and ammunition from us! Already the gold of Eu rope is flooding across the Atlantic at a rate so fast w e haven't got enough warships to bring it over! Any crisis in Europe can do only good.\" (Of course he was referring to \"good for his Zionist ma sters.\") It has been pretty well established that Roosevelt willfully committed high treason and consented to premeditated murder of Ame rican citizens at Pearl Harbor. This moribund paraplegic desperately sought \"Casus belli.\" He was no doubt, ably advised by his Jewish financi ers, Bernard Baruch and Henry Morgenthau. Sure enough, the planned sacr ifice of thousands of American servicemen was the pound of flesh which was well invested with the international Judeo-Masonic bankers. If a common name for traitor in America is Benedict Arnold, since World War II it should have been Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Instead, he is held up to the praise of our people as one of our greatest presidents. If the ar gument is used that this treason was necessary to defeat \"fascism,\" it might be well to recall that the worst kind of \"fascism\" ever known, was the Jud eo-Masonic Stalinism of the Soviet Union.

Menachem Begin put this thought into words a number of years ago, when speaking in New York to a group of Jewish millionaires, he said: \"There would be nothing wrong with Communism, if we were still running it!\" A few million dead \"goyim\" means nothing to this Ju deo- Masonic crowd!

In the Scottish Rite, the d ates of all official documents are given according to the Hebrew months and the Jewish era: and use is often made of the older Hebrew alphabet.

The pro fessed aims of the UNIVERSAL ISRAELITE ALLIANCE, founded in 1860, with its headquarters in Paris, runs parallel to the profess ed aims of Freemasonry and its founder, the Jew Adolf Cremeieux. For years he was the Grand Master of the Supreme Council of the Ancient Scotti sh Rite of Freemasonry. (For a list of the governing committee s of this Jewish Alliance, see THE JEWISH WHO's WHO, published in New York City) In France, the Jews were refranchised in 1790, unde r the influence of the Jacobins, who were the most AGGRESSIVE AND MILITANT OF THE ANTI-CHRIST FORCES which plagued France at this tim e.

Today, Christian Countries such as Canada, Page 150 Germany, England, the United States, Australia, Swe den, Norway, etc., have fallen under an almost complete Judeo-Masonic yoke. While most Masons will aggressively deny this, the anti-Christian character of Freemasonry is kept in the dark, and t he inner circles of the Lodge are defended with fanaticism. To give you an example, the following is part of a speech, delivered Sept. 20, 1902, by Senator Gelpech, President of the Fren ch Grand Orient: \"The triumph of the Galilean (Christ) has lasted fo r many centuries, but now he dies in turn.

The soul that is impure and sinful, and defiled with earthly stains, cannot again unite with God, until, by long trials and many purifications, it is finally delivered from the old calamity and Light overcomes Darkness and dethrones it, in t he soul.\" This is Oriental Mysticism, chapter and verse. But what does the Bible say about this? In Romans 6:23, we read; \"For the wages of sin (disobedience of God's law, 1 John 3:4 ) is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" And in Ephesians 2:8 - \"For by grace (the unmerited favor of God) are ye saved through faith; and that not of itself; it is a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.\" Men and women do Page 151 not obtain personal salvation through \"long trials and many purifications,\" as Pike avers. On pg. 625, Pike again states: \"The Kabalistic doctrine has long been the religion of the Sage and Savant (eminent scholar); because like Freemasonry, it incessantly tends towards spiritual perfection, and the fusing of the creeds (religions ) and nationalities of mankind.\" (Here he is referring to \"miscegenation,\" the sexual union between different races, which is forbidden by God's command).

Let's look at some facts which cannot be disputed. In 1982, at least 909 major daily newspapers in the United States, with a daily readership of some 49-million, were Jewish owned and/or controlle d. The majority of Jews who controlled these newspapers were high rank ing Masons. These included the following: WALL STREET JOURNAL - 1,406,192 - Warren Henry Philip, (Jew) President.

In addition, the vast majority of daily newspapers with distribution between 250,000 and 500,000, are Jewis h owned and/or controlled. These include the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE; MIAMI HERALD; ATLANTA JOURNAL; INDIANAPOLIS STAR; BOSTON GLOBE; KANSAS CITY TIMES ST. LOUIS GLOBE-DEMOCRAT and the OMAHA WORLD HERALD. Over 47 major weekly magazines, with an estimated readership over 78-million, are Jewish owned and/or controlled. These include: TV GUIDE - 19,168,096 - Walter Annenberg (Jew), President. McCALL'S MAGAZINE - 6,801,287 - Robert Stein (Jew), Editor. GOOD HOUSEKEEPING - 5,250,597 - Harrison Aaron Mitnich (Jew), Treasurer.

Do you wonder now, why there is so much pro-Zionist slant in our news. (For more details, send for my booklet, SATAN'S KIDS , ). Page 158 Even many privately owned newspapers, which are not Jewish owned, have a great deal of control exerted over them beca use Jews and Masons control the nations advertising, which is necessary for a newspaper or magazine to be successful. The great world news agencies such as United Press and Associated Press are Jewish controlled, as are Reuter and Wolff in England and Germany. This is one of the major reasons that the Christian Patriotic Movement in Canada and the United States will never receive fai r coverage. It is the nature of the Jewish-Masonic beast to \"lie.\" In his book L'ANTISEMITISAE , Jewish apologist Bernard Lazare says: \"The Jew is not content to dechristianize, he Judai zes; he destroys Christian beliefs; he provokes religious indifference, but he also imposes on those whose fa ith he destroys, his own concept of the world, of morality , and of human life; he labors at the age-old task - the des truction of the religion of Christ.\" This was not meant as an expose, but was a boast re garding Jewish power. The whole Socialist World Movement, from its beginn ing, was a Jewish- Masonic operation. It has only been within the last hundred years, that the objective of a world controlled state, controlled b y Jewish-Masonic power using gold and international money power as its pri nciple instrument of control, has come to the forefront, In spite of its claims to the contrary, Internation al Freemasonry has proven itself to be essentially materialistic, naturalisti c and selfish.

At a conference Page 159 of Masonic leaders from the Allied Powers (France, England, Italy, etc.), held in Paris, January 14, 15, 1917, it was decided to convene a Congress of Freemasons in June 1918. This would include Maso nic leaders from all the Allied and Neutral Powers. This Congress was fo r the primary purpose of making the following declaration: \"To prepare the way for the United States of Europe ; to set up a supra-national (above all nations) authority, whose purpose would be to settle disputes between nations . Freemasons were to be the propaganda agents of this venture, which it was said would bring universal pe ace and happiness to mankind, viz., this was to be THE LEAG UE OF NATIONS.\" 1 In the Protestant churches of the early 20th Centur y the nature of Freemasonry was clearly understood and openly conde mned. At a conference of English Methodist ministers, held at Bradford, England, June 22, 1927, the following resolution was passed: \"Freemasonry in its ritual and official language is of a theistic natur e ... The distinctive faith of Christianity and the Christian message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ is wholly incompatible with the claims put f orth by Freemasonry in writing and speech.\" This Methodist Conference recommended that Methodis t ministers have nothing to do with Freemasonry.

Page 160 20 - THE ETHICS OF FREEMASONRY The foundation of Masonic morality or ethics, is no t founded on the religion of Jesus Christ, the 'faith once delivered unto the saints,\" (Jude 3 ). It is founded on the false, man-made religion of Freemasonry, which is \"Secular Humanism. Masonic ethics define the duty of a Mason to his \"f ellow Masons,\" not to mankind as a whole. In this they follow the example of the Jews, whose code of ethics concerns only the Jews, not the \"goy im animals\" they rub shoulders with. In Freemasonry, the ultimate standard of what is ri ght and wrong, is wrapped up in what is good for Masonry, not in what the Bible says about it. They do not follow the Law of God, as given to Israel on Mt. Sinai, universally known as the TEN COMMANDMENTS. They fol low what Masons call \"the law of nature and nature's god.\" T his, they teach, is the"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"operation of the Divine nature in man, as discerned by human reason and experience. The Mason is not taught the Scriptural truth, that the \"heart Jewan is desperately wicked and deceitful above all things\" (Jer. 17:12) ; instead they are taught that through the \"innate go odness\" of man, he can become like God. The moral aspects of the \"jaw of n ature,\" cannot be found in Scripture, but in the \"lectures, obligator y oaths, and geometrical figures and terms of Freemasonry.\" These moral obligations are veiled to the lower ran ks of the Lodge, under symbolism known only to the higher initiates. The Ten Commandments, as explained by Jesus Christ, are rejected and repudiated by Freemasonry, though their retention o f what they call \"moral law.\" The law given to Page 161 Israel on Mt. Sinai, is considered to be \"too narro w\" for the higher intelligentsia of the Lodge to accept. So they subs titute the GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE, for GOD ALMIGHTY, while they substitute their \"natural law,\" for the \"immutable (unchangeable) law of God,\" In MACKEY'S JURISPRUDENCE , p.205, Mackey states: \"The Ten Commandments are not obligatory upon a Mas on as a Mason, because the institution is tolerant and cosmopolite (a citizen of the world), and cannot re quire its members to give their adhesion to any religious dog mas or precepts, excepting those which express belief in G od and the immortality of the soul.\" Masonic law, had its roots in \"Deism.\" It was \"deis m\" which transformed the Masonic guilds in Europe from an operative into a speculative fraternity. The Masonic Lodges, under the influence of the Jewish Humanist-Intelligentsia Movement, adopted \"natural law\" as its moral law. It is a law which appeals to the carnal nature of man, because there is no Superior Being to whom one is responsible. In re ality, in Freemasonry, as in Judaism, man becomes his own god. Findel, a high ranking Mason said:"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"\"The decisive agent in accomplishing the transforma tion of Masonry was that intellectual movement under the na me of 'deism,' which boldly rejected all revelation and r eligious dogma, under the banner of 'Reason,' and 'Higher Criticism!'\" 1 Early Masonic leaders such Lord Herbert Hobbes, Lor d Bolingbroke, Dr. Tindal, David Hume and others, taught that the indu lgence of lust and anger, self-love, ambition, lust for power, could a ll be gratified.

And: \"Let us not sin (break God's law, see 1 John 3:4 ) therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof\" (Gal. 6:12). Also: \"Flee also youthful lusts (greed for material and f leshly things): but follow righteousness, faith, love, pea ce, with them that call on the Lord from a pure heart\" ( 2 Tim. 2:22 ). Masonry does not believe in, or teach this Scriptur al restraint of natural desires. Their motto is: \"If it makes you feel good; do it!\" Both the Jewish atheist Voltaire and Helvetius who were early French Deists and Freemasons, advocated unlimited gratific ation of carnal appetites. Rosseau made men's feelings the basic fo r Masonic standards. 2 Freemasonry can never be brought into accord with t he teachings of Jesus Christ, for He said without equivocation:"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"\"Whoso putteth away (divorces) his wife, and marrie s another, committeth adultery,\" (Luke 16:18).

See Home's Introduction to the Scriptures, Vol. 1, p.31. Page 163 The ritual of Freemasonry was based on incestuous a cts, the deceptions and frauds of Zeus, which he practiced on his mothe r Demeter, and upon his daughter. These acts are re-enacted before the initiate to impress him with the moral teachings of the \"mysteries.\" The \"natural law,\" once practiced by mankind, befor e the codified law was given at Mt. Sinai, had become obscured by men's si ns; it was no longer a clear guide to human behavior. The idea of \"Let you r conscience be your guide,\" has never proved workable, because natural man is sinful. The Bible says that even the very imagination of his he art are \"only evil continually. \"(Gen. 6:5). To the savage in the heartlands of Africa, who has never heard of God's law concerning murder, he still knows instinctively that murder is wrong. But his conscience allows him to go against this na tural law and not only kill his enemy, but relish eating him. Masonic teachings negate the Christian viewpoint co ncerning family ties and Christian standards of marriage. Masonry teache s that a woman who yields to the impulses of her nature, is absolved f rom all shame and that a Freemason should renounce the \"narrow minded standa rds\" set up for the Christian by the Scripture."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"You get a much better understanding of Freemasonry, when you look at the oaths and covenants which make a man a Mason. T hey are the central ceremony of his initiation into the \"brotherhood.\" They are his formal declaration of loyalty to the Masonic religion. Whe n the initiate kneels at the Masonic alter, and places one hand under the Bi ble and the other on the \"compass and square\" which rests on the book, h e evokes the deity to help him in his purpose. Only, unfortunately, this deity is not the God of Christianity. Throughout the entire ceremony there is an outward semblance of great loyalty towards the Bible and God. But Page 164 the question we must ask is this? What is the meani ng of all this pageantry? An honest look at the rituals of Freemas onry will show you that this ceremony is symbolic and allegorical (the description of one thing, under another name), and does not mean what it so solemnly expresses. The Bible, the Square and Compass, the Alter, are a ll Masonic symbols which stand for other things. They are substitutes, if you will, for the real objects venerated by Freemasonry. They have a secre t, hidden meaning which very probably the initiate does not understan d, since its meaning is known only to those of higher rank. The real Masoni c moral ideas are concealed in the allegorical acts of the candidate. A study of Freemasonry will show that the Masonic c andidate is not bound by his solemn oath, but by the meaning of the symbolism behind them. It is not reverence for the Bible, that he sh ows, as he takes his oath with one hand under the Book, but reverence to what the Bible symbolizes to the Mason and what the Bible on the Masonic alta r really means to him. He does not swear on the \"square and compass,\" but on what they symbolically stand for. It is not the name of the L ord God Jehovah, which he invokes, but what the term 'God' means to the Ma son. When a Mason uses the term \"In the name of God,\" it means by the authority of the god of Freemasonry, the GREAT ARCH ITECT OF THE UNIVERSE, who is not the Christian God by any stret ch of the imagination. The candidate is bound to faithfulness by the horrible oaths he takes, which show his condemnation if he is unfa ithful. These are not the moral ethics one expects to find in Christianit y. They contradict the Scripture found in Romans 8:1, which tell the Christian: \"There is"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\" Page 165 21 - TRUTH FROM THE MASONIC STANDPOINT! The moral law makes it the duty of every person to speak the truth. We are told in Proverbs 13:5 - \"a righteous man hateth lying.\" In Proverbs 12:22 - \"Lying lips are an abomination unto the Lord.\" (Some thing that makes Him want to \"throw up.\") The moral law forbids lyin g, deceit and \"dissembling\" (disguising things), concealing them under false pretenses whether by words or actions. No class of men are ex empt from this obligation. But in Masonry, as in Judaism, their followers do n ot follow the same law as that laid down for Christians. As a result, a Ma son is allowed to lie, if it will help a fellow Mason; just as a Jew is allowed to lie in order to cheat a hated \"goyim.\" The very fact that Freemasonry is so secret, foster s the desire to deceive others. The whole international organization is bas ed on a lie, teaches it, and encourages its disciples to lie also. The entir e system of Masonic rites, lectures and symbolism is for the purpose of deceiv ing others as to their true meaning. The candidate solemnly swears that he will \"forever conceal and never reveal the (false) secrets of \"Masonry.\" He swears never to reveal the secrets of a brother Mason which are entrusted to h im, even though by this act, he may become implicated in a crime. In the ca se of murder or treason, he may act at his discretion, but in the h igher degrees, even murder and treason are not revealed. Logically, this means, that in order to be a Mason, and keep your promise to Masonry, you must be willing to lie, deceive and dissemble if it is for the good of Masonry. Sickle says: \"Temperance is enjoined, not for its o wn sake, but for the reason that when a Mason is intoxicated, he might r eveal unwittingly, the secrets of Masonry.\" "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Page 166 The Masonic fraternity teaches and encourages its m embers to perjure themselves as to their civil oaths, if this becomes necessary for the honor and protection of the Lodge. The oath of a Mason takes precedence over everythin g else in his life. It teaches him that violations of this oath as a witne ss or as a citizen, is not perjury, as long as it is for the good of the Lodge . So just as a Jew may lie, to convict a Gentile, so a Mason may lie 'with impu nity, to protect another Mason or his Lodge. The moral standards of Judaism and Freemasonry are so similar, because they come from the same un-Godl y source. One of the best examples I can think of' to show ho w Jews will lie to convict Christians, can be seen in the recent Canad ian trial of Ernst Zundel, a Canadian of German descent, who has been on trial in Canadian courts, under their infamous \"hate law.\" They have accused Zundel of deliberately lying, when he wrote a booklet questio ning whether 6-million Jews really died in Germany during World War II. Many Jewish witnesses brought by the prosecution, w ho were supposed to be victims of German concentration camps, so obviou sly lied, that their stories could only be called absurd. For instance, a Polish Jew, who was an atheist, testified for the defense of Mr. Zundel. H e told the court that if the Jewish witnesses who were testifying against Zundel , were required to take the oath before a Jewish Rabbi, rather than a \"Gentile\" judge, every one would be required to change their story. But be cause their oath had been taken before a non-Jew judge, they were free t o lie. This is the plain teaching of the TALMUD. In Volume BABA KAMA (1 13a) we read: 'Jews must always try and deceive Christians.\" In Volume ZOHAR (I,106a) it says: 'A Jew may lie and perjure himself to condemn a Christian.\" Again in Volume BABA KAMA (I 13a) it says: \"a Jew may lie in court to condemn a Christian.\" Page 167 This is the same type of deception practiced by Fre emasonry. If a Mason is required to testify in court, and his testimony conflicts with his duty as a Mason, his MASONIC DUTY MUST ALWAYS COME FIRST! Whe n we see the truth of this, then we need to ask a ver y important quest- ion: \"How can we trust any Jewish or Freemasonic judge o r lawyer, to tell the truth, even when they are under oath?\""},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The statements of Freemasonry pertaining to the \"la mbskin apron;\" the \"middle chamber of King Solomon's Temple; of \"Hiram Abiff;\" of the \"pillars\" and a host of other things, are all false hoods, palmed off on the unsuspecting initiate.

The exotic langua ge it employs is for the purpose of deception, but the candidate does not kn ow this, and so is deceived. Masons say that to expose the secrets of Masonry, i s perjury, while at the same time say that these exposures are not Masonic secrets. It is similar to the Zionists, who rage and scream against the PROTOCOLS OF THE LEARNED ELDERS OF ZION, while they follow them like a \"blueprint.\" Something seems to be lacking, when an organization constantly contradicts itself. If from the Masonic viewpoint, those who secede from and expose the Masonic ritual are perjurers, then w hat they publish about Masonry must of necessity be fact. Much of what you have read in this book, comes from men who have held high positions in Freemasonry. They have no bone to pick with their fellow Masons, other than the deception which is be ing perpetrated on millions of men, by their leaders. My heart goes ou t to the millions of men in the Blue Lodge, who have been completely Page 168 \"hoodwinked\" by the hierarchy of Freemasonry, so th at \"they believe Masonic lies.\" Hectethorn, in his (Vol. 2:17) says: \"Since the obj ects that modern Masonry professes to pursue, are brotherly love, re lief and truth, surely the pursuits of these objects cannot need secret rites, traditions and ceremonies.\" In (Vol. 2:18), he goes on to say: \"Th e true regeneration of mankind needs neither secret signs nor passwords to recognize each other. True liberty consists in publicity.\" In (Vol. 2:109 ), he states: \"Masons have been very indignant with me for making these s tatements, but honest members of the craft know, and occasionally admit, that I am right.\" In (Vol. 2:106): \"The more I study Freemasonry, the mo re I am repelled by its pretenses. Are not all its pretenses groundless ? Is not its present existence a delusion and the imposition of childish oaths a farce?\""},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"This is what can be termed the \"morality of languag e.\" To use names and words which do not not convey their true meaning, i s dishonest in itself. It is the same underhanded essence we see used by the KGB, the CIA, and the Israeli MOSSAD in international intrigue. It is because of this trickery, that Freemasons and Jews have been able to insinuate themselves into, and practically control, the Lawyers Guild of this country. They control the laws of America, thr ough their control in Congress, on the President's Cabinet, as members of the Supreme Court. In other words, what I am trying to tell you, is th at Canada and the United States are controlled by Jews and Freemasons, both working for the same purpose, to cause us to give up our sovereignty, an d merge our countries into a One-World system, controlled by Jews and Fre emasons. These men, have an absolute hatred for those in America and Ca nada who can honestly be termed as \"Christian Patriots,', and ar e doing everything in their power to destroy them. Page 169 I can give one example with which I am familiar. A few years ago, a man I knew rather well, shot and killed a State trooper, after he had received merciless harassment at the hands of the police, no t because of criminal activities, but because he was speaking up against government injustices and had to be silenced. When the local sheriff inve stigated the incident, he contacted the man's wife and said: \"Mrs. ____ befor e I begin this investigation, there is something which is absolute ly essential that I know. Was your husband a Mason?\" Why do you suppose he wo uld ask a question such as this, unless if this man had been a Mason, he might have been spared much of the grief that the law brought on him and his family. This is not an isolated incident by any means! Masons are urged by their superiors, to perjurer th emselves in court in order to protect their fellow Masons. It is all par t of the oath they take, when they join. Many Masons, and most non-Masons, do not realize th at Masonry uses a special language to convey Masonic values. It often calls things by their opposites. It substitutes Masonic legends for facts , and palms them off as being true historical events. It expresses its paga n ideals and legendary lore in Scriptural terminology in order to fool the unsuspecting public as well as its own members."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"It calls heathen deities by the Biblical name of Go d, and heathen rites by their Christian phrases. It couches its Masonic doc trine in the terms of Christian theology. This deception in itself' shoul d turn honest men against it. Its entire system is based on pretense, delusion an d fraud. It hides its pagan moral and religious ideas under the veil of a rtful speech, emblems and types. It inculcates in its members moral and r eligious ideals which are completely contrary to the Christian viewpoint and which are actually viciously immoral. It enjoins practices, which Page 170 from a Scriptural standpoint are damnable. It makes the crime, the vice, and the sin inherent in Freemasonry, not in the act of being exposed. What can be more immoral than the pretense that mem bership in this international order, gives one the license to live his life as a lie? From the viewpoint of Biblical Christian ethics, Freemasonry must be looked on as a stupendous organized falsehood. Over against the undisputed facts of its falsehood, the Lodge solemnly professes to be guided solely by truth, even as it admits that it lies to its disciples. When a charge of deception is brought against the L odge, its defenders often reply: \"Our statements cannot be understood b y the profane (those outside the Lodge); there is a secret meaning conve yed by our expressions that only the craftsmen can discern.\" So it attempt s to evade the charges of falsehood, by hiding under an esoteric smoke screen . One of the greatest prophets of Freemasonry, a man named Pythagoras, instituted an esoteric system of outright deceit an d taught his disciples that \"it was not only lawful, but praiseworthy to deceiv e, and use the expedient lie to further the cause of truth and piety.\" 1 The sacred books of Buddha, a religion which is wel comed in Freemasonry, defines falsehood as: \"A statement con sists of a lie when discovered by the person to whom it is told as bein g untrue.\" In other words, it is not a falsehood, as long as this fact is not discovered."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"So statements made by the hierarchy of Masonry are to be considered true, until someone discovers they are lies.

See Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, Vol. 1, p. 198 Page 171 Most decent people see the need of honesty in deali ng with others. In the Christian life, it is an absolute necessity and an important part of his religion. But to the Jew and the Mason, it becomes a means of deceiving and cheating those who disagree with them. In the J ew, this pertains mainly to the \"goyim, non-Jew animal he calls a Gen tile.\" The well-known Jewish businessman and author, Samuel Roth, in his startling book, JEWS MUST LIVE (Secrets of Sharp Jewish Business Practices Revealed), Chap. VI, p.63, says: \"It is my honest belief that nothing the Jew does i s subversive to America's best interests. Like his cr eature JEHOVAH, a teacher he never tires of imitating, the Jew is forever engaged in the fascinating pursuit of creat ing everything he needs out of nothing. He is actually a parasite who could not exist without a Gentile host on which to feed.\" The present Jewish State of the Israeli in Palestin e is an excellent example of this. According to Israeli leaders, their countr y would collapse within six months, if it were not for the largesse of the American people, especially its \"brainwashed\" Judeo-Christian popula tion. The Jew is taught from youth that it is ethical to \"skin the goyim; to cheat him and steal from him.\" After all, he is told, onl y Jews are human and the world belongs to them. Every year on the Day of Atonement (a day which is now being celebrated in many Christian churches with the ringing of thei r church bells), Jews around the world gather to recite the KOL NIDRE. In English this means"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"'All Vows Prayer.\" It is recited three times in the Jewish synagogue w ith the congregation standing, while the Rabbis chant f rom the altar. Immediately following the recital of this Vow, the religious ceremonies of the Day of Atonement begin. This is the holiest \"ho ly day\" of the Jewish year and is celebrated by Jews, worldwide. Even lib eral and atheistic Jews, who rarely if ever attend the synagogue services, m ake it a point to attend on this day. Why is this Page 172 KOL NIDRE OATH so important to Jews, worldwide? Look at the translation and see. Here is the official English t ranslation of the KOL NIDRE: \"All vows, obligations, oaths, anathemas, whether c alled 'kona' or 'konas,' or by any other name which we may vow, or swear, or pledge, or whereby we may be bound from this DAY OF ATONEMENT until th e next, whose happy coming we await, we do repent! May they be de emed absolved, forgiven, annulled and void, and made of none effec t. They shall not bind us nor have any power over us. The vows shall not b e reckoned as vows; the obligations as obligations, nor the oaths as oa ths.\" By taking this oath, the Jew is absolved from any a greement he makes under oath, even if it is taken in a court of law. He is not obliged by his god, (who by the way, is not the God of Abraham, he claims to serve) to keep his sworn word, especially to a \"Gentile.\" Non e of his vows are valid. With this in mind, how can we expect a Jewish Congr essman, who takes this KOL NIDRE oath, to fulfill his sworn duty to protect the Cons titution of the United States from all enemies foreign and d omestic?\" How can we expect a Jewish judge or lawyer to fulfill his swor n duty, when we know his oath is no good? We cannot! Neither can we expe ct honesty from a Mason, for they too are absolved from telling the t ruth, if it is to the detriment of the Lodge. Having shown the foundation of Freemasonry in Judai sm, do you suppose that some of the Jewish deceit used by Jews against \"gentiles,\" may have rubbed off on Masons? I think it is very possible. Notice this oath, taken by the Master Mason (Rit. 149): \"I solemnly promise and swear that I will not cheat , wrong, or defraud a Lodge of Masons, or a brother of this rank, knowing them to be such, but will give them due and"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"timely notice that they may ward off all approachin g danger.\" This simply means that a Master Mason may not only cheat non-Masons with impunity, but that he can also cheat Masons wh o are of a lower rank than himself. All others Page 173 are lawful prey to him. This is almost identical to the Jewish KOL NIDRE and has the same effect. When we look at the Ninth Commandment (see Exodus 20 ), which reads: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neig hbor,\" and Number Eight which says: \"Thou shalt not steal!\", it would appear that we are to so fear and love God, that we would never defraud our fellowmen, whether they are members of our Lodge or not. But a Master Mason, by reason of his oath, may use any unfair, unscrupulous, fraudul ent means to gain advantage and wealth, so long as he does not hurt m embers of his own, or higher ranks in Freemasonry. The sin is not in the sinning, in Masonry, but in being caught and bringing disgrace to the Lodge! 22 - MASONRY'S IDEAS ON CHASTITY The Seventh Commandment clearly states: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery!\" There is no equivocation here, there is no way we who love God can by-pass this with impunity. It means that i f we fear and love God, we will remain chaste and pure in our thoughts, wor ds and deeds, each man honoring his own wife, and that of his fellowma n. Being a man, I know that it is not always easy to avoid impure tho ughts, but our Lord taught that \"adultery lies in the heart of men, rat her than in the outward act itself.\" Men are prone to look on the outward act, while God judges the heart. The Christian system strives to purify the h earts and thoughts of both men and women. There is no way a man or woman who loves God, can escape the finality of this Commandment. But it is quite different in the Masonic Page 174 system. Instead of aiming at purifying the thoughts of a man's heart, Masonry aims to legalize the sin of lust and find a ccommodation for the"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"indulgence of the individual within the framework o f the Lodge. No wonder Freemasonry is so popular with so many men. The essence of vice in the Masonic system is not in the indulgence itself, but in failing to keep it concealed from the profan e (non-member). As long as the indulgence is concealed, to the Mason i t is a virtue. It is a vice only to the Christians, whom they claim are too stu pid to realize all the fun they are missing. What makes things \"vices\" in the estimation of the Christian, is their erroneous position on morals, according to Freemaso nry. This makes the ethics of Masonry irreconcilable with those of Chri stianity. This is why a Christian, who professes to have turned his life ov er to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, has no business being a Lodge member. (Now I realize I will be stepping on a lot of toes by making this stateme nt, since there are many professing Christians in the Lodge. In fact many of the clergy of the Southern Baptist Church are Masons. Once they see t he inner workings of the Lodge, they should know better. But whether the y like it or not, this does not change the truth). Perhaps, it might be well for me to quote to these brethren, the words of the Apostle Paul to the church at Galatia: 'Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?\" (Galatians 4:16). To find the truth regarding Masonic ideas of chasti ty, we need to go to the Masonic Covenant, since this in essence is what mak es a Mason. There is something in that Covenant which when taken, or ent ered into, changes a man into a different \"moral order,\" and marks him a s guided by a system of ethical principles and precepts which are not fo und in the Christian system. The Mason becomes a \"different order of man ,\" bound by his covenant to Freemasonry and a different system of e thics. He now has, in the eyes of the Lodge, certain rights and liberties , which the Law of God does not give him. The Hidden Power Behind Freemasonry Part 8 of 8 By Lt. Col. Gordon \"Jack\" Mohr,"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Page 175 The Masonic devotee enters into a new and unique re ligious and moral realm, by having renounced the God of revelation, t o covenant and make the \"generative principle,\" under the name of THE GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE, his god, and the \"law of nature,\" his ethical standard! As we examine the Masonic teachings concerning chas tity, we need to look at the Master Mason's Oath relating to virtue (Rit. 149) - \"I solemnly promise and swear that I will not violate the chast ity of a Master Mason's wife, mother, sister or daughter, knowing her as su ch.\" God's law says: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery!\" It speaks to all men and women, married and single. It speaks to the Mason a nd it does not say: \"You may violate this law, as long as you do not vi olate it with a Master Mason's females. But this is a \"narrow moral code\" which the natural man does not like. It was given by Almighty God for our protection. In Matthew 7:13, 14 we read where two roads are open to mankind, one is br oad and easy and leads to destruction. The majority opt to follow th is road. The Christian way is narrow and difficult to follow,\" because it means we MUST control our illicit desires. Therefore few people want to f ollow it, even though it leads to \"Eternal Life.\" The Masonic teaching follows the \"broad road to des truction,\" because men would have it so. The Masonic oath insists on c hastity within the rank of Master Mason, but it hedges and \"beats around th e bush,\" as far as the major question goes. It even allows him to have ill icit Page 176 relations with the females of a fellow Master Mason , as long as he does not know they belong to him. NOTICE: 1.- It forbids adultery with the chaste female memb ers of another Master Mason's family. 2.- Since even this prohibition is \"too narrow\" for Masonic liberalism, a qualifying phrase is added: \"knowing her to be such.\" \"Ignorance is bliss,\" according to the Mason ic way"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"of thinking and the Seventh Commandment should real ly be interpreted to read: \"Thou, a Master Mason, shal l not commit adultery with a female member of a Master Mason's family, as long as you know she is chaste.\" 3.- Assuming the Master Mason respects his Covenant , is it because of his respect for chastity or because the \"holiness\" of Masonry demands it? To all these questions we mu st give a resounding \"NO!\" answer. The Master Mason respects the chastity of a female relative of his brother Master Mason, because his oath tells him he must. H ere again we see the Jewish influence in Freemasonry, for in Judaism, ac cording to the TALMUD, a Jewish man may violate a Gentile woman, b ecause she is looked on as a \"piece of fresh meat.\" This same spi ritual authority (TALMUD) gives him the right to violate a baby girl under the age of three and to sodomize a boy under the age of nine. You don't have to go very far in Freemasonry, to see the evil influence of Judaism in their morals. In Masonry, as in Judaism, fear, love and t rust in God has nothing to do with their moral standards. If there is virtue in obedience to a man-made coven ant, it is the same virtue and honor known among thieves and cut throat s, when they swear to be true to their fellows, for fear of the punish ment which may befall them, if they break their contract. Page 177 This is the same kind of \"virtue\" King Herod showed in Matthew 14:6- 11, when for the sake of a stupid promise he made to a prostitute, and for public appearance sake, he had John the Baptist exe cuted. Christians believe in obeying God's Law because it proves their fear of His majesty, and their love for His mercy and love. Christ said: 'if ye love me, keep my commandments.\" We show our love for Him, by the way we obey Him ( John 14:15). The Mason obeys the Masonic laws, even when they conflict with those of God, because that is th e nature of the \"Masonic beast.\" They view the Ten Commandments as another f orm of \"moral law,\" which is too narrow for them to keep. 23 - WHAT MASONRY PERMITS! With this kind of obtuse (dull and insensitive) thi nking, we find things permitted within the Lodge which are strictly forbi dden in the Christians"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"life. Notice some of these practices and ask yourse lf whether they are moral or not: a. -Notice that the Oath of the Master Mason allows him to commit adultery with any unchaste female related to a fellow Mason, or with any other woman if he so desi res. b. - It permits him to conceal his adultery, if he does not know the female concerned is related to a fellow Ma ster Mason. There is no evidence anywhere, that he is ex pected to try and find out if this relationship exists. c. - A Masonic Oath is not retroactive, so this fea ture stimulates lower degrees to work into the higher de grees where they have more protection while \"doing their own thing.\" Page 178 d. - Their Oath permits the Master Mason to commit adultery with any female who does not belong to the restricted group. e. - This Oath permits the Master Mason to be an ad ulterer as long as he follows the restrictions laid down by his order, or as long as he keeps his indiscretions sec ret. f. - While this Masonic covenant seems to protect f emale virtue, it actually undermines it. It makes the gui lt for adultery committed, the fault of the woman, rather than of her Masonic seducer. In all cases where the Master Mason does not know she is related to another Master Maso n, or when she is not, the Master Mason is considered inn ocent, even if his act is an act of rape against her will. To him, she is \"nothing but a piece of meat,\" to be used anyway the Mason desires. What a travesty of decency and justice this is; wha t a contravention of Christian morality. Yet it is considered the sacred right by many men, who live under the protective screen of Freemasonry."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"In all cases of immorality, not covered by his oath , the Mason is absolved of guilt, since he is only following the dictates a nd inclination of his \"natural self,\" which is the deity he worships. Matthew 6:24 tells us: \"NO man can serve two masters: for either he will h ate the one and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and des pise the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.\" (MAMMON is \"materialism,\" \"love of the flesh,\" \"Nat uralism.\") A man cannot be a Mason and still serve and love the true God! Page 179 24 - WHAT DOES THE MASONIC COVENANT ASSUME? 1. - It assumes that females in general have a high opinion of Masonic honor and dignity. I believe this to be true. This is one reason a Mason may be more successful in his seduction of an unwary woman, than other men. 2. - It assumes that somehow or other, the Master M ason is a sanctified (saintly, inviolable being), somehow o r other holy, and that he hallows anything he touches. In p lain terms, that a woman should feel honored to be seduc ed by a Master Mason. 3. - It assumes that womanly chastity is a joke and that women will gladly sacrifice their virtue and honor for the privilege of being with a Master Mason. (It's no wo nder, that women who have studied Masonry, feel it is an insult to womanhood, because it definitely is). 4. - It sets no restriction on the chastity and mor ality of the Master Mason. He is free to debauch womanhood outsi de of the restrictions of his Order and still consider himself to be a good, moral man. It is a filthy \"double standa rd\" of living. Anyone who understands the least bit about Christian standards, should be able to see the evil in such a system."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Since the Ten Commandments do not apply to a Master Mason, he becomes a \"law unto himself,\" and this morality car ries over into his business and political dealings. (I would call your attention to the large number of politicians, who have been Masons, whose shady deals have walked the thin edge of treason, according to the C onstitutional definition, Article III, Sect. 3: \"Treason shall consist only i n levying war against them (the United States); adhering to their enemies; giv ing them aid and comfort.\" Any Fifth Page 180 Grader should be able to understand the meaning of this. I dare you to check out those Senators who voted to give away our canal in Panama and see for yourself, how many were Masons I dare you t o check and see how many of those Congressmen who have voted to give Fo reign Aid, to countries which are our enemies, are Masons, Jews o r both. If after you have seen this and do not believe this is a reflect ion on their Masonic training, then it is because you have deliberately closed your eyes to the truth. Could it be possible that this is one of the reason s that so many politicians who claim to be Christian, are also Masons? They sh ow very little of the \"Christian fruits\" in their politics, which reeks o f Masonic intrigue. The old Duck Theory applies here I believe: \"When you s ee something that looks like a duck, waddles like a duck, has feather s like a duck, and runs around with other ducks, chances are you are lookin g at a duck.\" So when you see a political figure, who claims to be a Chri stian, yet he runs around with an un-Christian crowd and votes for anti-Chris t measures, you can almost bet that he is a member of a Masonic Lodge, and very possibly a very high ranking member. When a man takes the oath of Freemasonry, he is req uired to step out of obedience to Almighty God and give his loyalty to t he Lodge. He then places himself under a completely di Areent moral g overnment, bound by a different set of moral ethics. These are diametri cally opposed to Christianity. Masonic writers boast: \"It is the covenant that mak es a Mason; and once a Mason, always a Mason. Once you have taken the Maso nic oath, you cannot repudiate it.\""},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"These remarks make it crystal clear that the Mason becomes a \"different order of man,\" governed by a different code, which sets him at variance with the laws of Page 181 God Almighty. Things which are \"unlawful\" to the \"p rofane\" (those outside the Lodge), become lawful to the Lodge memb er, providing he does his sinning in such a way that it does not bri ng disgrace to the Lodge or his fellow Masons. Masonry legalizes \"lustful sinning\" in every sphere , save the one where he is limited in his wanton acts from violating a fema le member of a Master Mason's family. (Even then, he has an excuse, if he does not know they belong to a fellow Master Mason). This gives a man a lot of leeway in which to fulfill his illicit desires. If Masonry never changes, as its leaders proudly av er, then men can never become better by joining it. If it allows its membe rs to sin, by putting a Masonic label of approval on sin, whether it is com mitted by a Master Mason, one of the 33 o , or a member of the Blue Lodge, it is still evil i n the sight of God and will earn the death penalty. \"The wages of sin is death,\" ( Romans 6:23 ). Sin, no matter whether it is committed by the \"m ighty\" or the \"lowly,\" produces the bitter fruit of Sodom and Gomorrah, for anything which encourages dishonesty, deception and unchastity is wrong in the eyes of God. We have His Holy Word to confir m this! Yet, unfortunately, in spite of the anti-Christ cha racter of this immoral system, we find thousands of good men who belong to it and defend it. Many of these claim to be Christian. Can this be a measure of their apostasy? 1 Timothy 4 says: 1 \"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the l atter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscien ce seared with a hot iron 7 But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exe rcise thyself rather unto Godliness.\""},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" Page 182 Because of these apostates, many of them Christian ministers who support Freemasonry, we find ourselves in the \"perilous tim es\" predicted in 2 Timothy 3:1 - 5 1 \"This know also, that in the last days perilous t imes shall come. 2 For men will be lovers of their own selves, covet ous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parent s, unthankful, unholy, 3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false a ccusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are go od, 4 Traitors, beady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God; 5 Having a form of Godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.\" This is a pretty good \"word description\" of the Mas onic Lodge, and certainly of any Christian pastors who belongs to i t. It is no wonder our churches have lost their power, with these \"wolves in sheep's clothing\" standing behind the pulpits of our churches. Can a true, \"born from above\" Christian have fellowship with such a strange and i mmoral institution? I think not! It doesn't make much sense! In 1 John 2:23, we are given a very clear definition of an anti-Ch rist. It is anyone who denies the Divinity of Jesus Christ; who denies Him as Savior. This fits any man, whether he is Jew, a Mas on, a Heathen, a Baptist, or whatever. In 2 John 10, 11, we are told how Christians should act towards these anti-Christs: \"If any come unto you and bring not this gospel (th at Jesus is the Son of God, the Savior of the world), receiv e him not into your house, neither bid him God Speed; For he that biddeth him God speed, becomes partakers of his evi l deeds.\" According to Masonic tradition, the Mason is a buil der, who is free to go anywhere in pursuit of his avocation. To the Mason, this means he is free from the moral and spiritual restraints organized s ociety imposes on its members; he is a \"jaw unto himself,\" doing what mak es him feel good, "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Page 83 25 - MASONRY'S RELATION TO MARRIAGE The Bible teaches that marriage is a union between man and woman for life, when it is sanctified in the eyes of God. The very essence of Christian marriage is in the consent of both parties, who joi n together before God and publicly acknowledge their troth (faithfulness; loyalty) to each other. This act, according to the Bible, makes them \"one f lesh.\" (See Gen. 2:23; Matt. 19:5,6; Mark 10:8; 1 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 5:31 ). This covenant between man and wife can only be broken by the unfa ithfulness of one or the other, or by death. The marriage bond may only be broken through the \"adultery\" of one party or the other, never for inc ompatibility.'' No man has the authority to break this marriage bond; no j udge, no preacher. The marriage ceremony is a covenant, which imposes on both parties, certain mutual duties and invests both with certain inalienable, God-given rights. These rights must be jealously guarded by b oth parties. By becoming \"one flesh,\" they have become something sp ecial in the eyes of God. The mutual duty of husband and wife is to rema in pure and chaste, honoring and loving each other. Neither may lawfull y (God's law) join in covenants with others, which will infringe on these conjugal rights. This Christian Covenant comes into immediate confli ct with the Masonic and Judaic Covenants, since both of these protect t he man's right to commit adultery. If either of these covenants are a ccepted in lieu of Christianity, it will doom Christian marriage and t he Christian family. Of course, this is the purpose of both Masonry and Jud aism. The wife in a Christian marriage covenant has the i nalienable right to know the nature of any contract her husband Page 184 may enter into with others, especially if this cont ract might weaken or annul his duty to remain chaste and pure. There is a Divine law involved here, which neither the man nor woman may evade wit h impunity. Their agreement is a matter of written record and neither has the moral nor spiritual right to overstep the bounds of this cont ract. The husband is bound to respect the law of God and follow it, just as he should expect his wife to do. There can be no such thing as a \"double-"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"standard\" for either of them, as has been so common in both Masonry and Judaism. In the Masonic contract, the wife is not consulted on the matter of the man's morals, neither by the Lodge, or by her husba nd. Even if she agrees with him becoming a Mason, she knows nothing about the nature of the covenant he has made with the Lodge and how it may effect her marriage. To all intents and purposes, she has become a \"chat tel.\" The Masonic Covenant supersedes any other covenant the Mason ma y make with God or his fellowmen. He must subordinate everything, e ven his family, to his Masonic belief. 26 - THE PENAL FEATURES OF FREEMASONRY When Freemasonry is traced back to its source, we d iscover three ideas which are common to most oriental cults: 1. - The initiation process: 2 .- The Lodge secrets, and; 3. - The penal features dealing with punishment of recalcitrant Lodge members. From the very beginning of our search for truth, we will discover that the character of Freemasonry and Christianity are diame trically opposed. Page 185 Where Christianity wins followers by propagating th e truth, taught by its founder, Jesus Christ, Masonry aims to preserve and propagate its faith by keeping secret. It does not rely on the power of it s doctrines to do this, since it does not present its claims openly and hon estly, nor does it meet its opponents in an open and fair discussion. Like Judaism, from which it sprang, it instead attacks its opponents secretly, through institutions it controls, such as the media. On the basis of its ow n confusion, it cannot stand the light of truth and exposure. The Christia n, on the other hand, is told to \"Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned wit h salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man', (Col. 4:6). To protect its secrecy, Masonry found it necessary to install a catalog of oaths and terrible covenants, which were set up for the purpose of"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"destroying those who sought to expose their nefario us activities and terrify its own members into a strict and total obedience t o the Masters of the Lodge. According to their own admissions, which can be fou nd in the Masonic oaths, they employ any means of discrediting or des troying their opponents. They may with impunity, through false te stimony, discredit or completely destroy an opponent's reputation, may di scomfort, or even completely annihilate them. This extends to the poi nt of committing murder, if that is deemed necessary for the protect ion of the Lodge, as was the case in the murder of William Morgan in the 182 0's. He was assassinated on order of the Lodge authorities, whe n he sought to expose them. Masons infer that they are rendering service to the GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE, when they destroy any one who seeks to expose them. This is a murderous spirit, similar to that f ound among some of the extremists in t> Page 186 Masons are willing, according to their oaths, to in flict barbarous and horrible penalties on any brother Mason who strays from their way and exposes them. This reveals the true spirit which pe rvades Freemasonry and which most certainly does not exhibit the \"frui ts of the Spirit,\" which are the attributes of true Christians (See Gal. 5:22, 23 ). When it becomes necessary to enforce obedience to a n idea, in order to promulgate it, you can automatically know that idea is wrong. If, as some members of Masonry aver, Masonry does not have this cruel, vindictive spirit, then why do they exhibit it in their oaths which cause them to become members? That most Masons believe these oath s, is an established fact, for very few leave the Order, once they becom e members. This is not because they know their way is true, but because th ey fear the consequences. It takes an extremely brave man to le ave Freemasonry, and then expose it! That the threats implied in the Masonic oaths are m ade in good faith, can be ascertained from the past. French, Italian and S panish Masons cited before their Masonic tribunals for breaking their o aths, were the Emperor Napoleon III; the Emperor of Germany; the Crown Pri nce of Germany; a Pope and Marshall Prim. of France. These men paid n o attention to the"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"citations made against them by the Lodge and all we re marked for assassination. (See Hecthorn, Vol. II, p. 108). The murder of William Morgan, in obedience to a Mas onic decree, almost destroyed Masonry in America in 1826. Judge Whitney of the Belvedere Lodge in Illinois, escaped assassination at the han ds of Master Masons, only because they feared public vengeance if they k illed this popular man. The very initiation into the Third Degree, is a dra matic \"acting out\" of a symbolic murder. The candidate for all intents and purposes is murdered by these ruffians, who inflict on him the horrible penalties inherent in the first Page 187 three degrees. When these are apprehended, they are theoretically executed by having the penalties of the first three degrees inflicted on them. This is done to impress the Masonic candidate with the seriousness of his pledge and the vengeance which will follow i f he breaks his oath. The Knights of Kadash deliberately promise to commi t murder on any traitor to Freemasonry. Judge Whitney, who was mentioned earlier, testified in the case of a Miss Ellen Slade, who had been murdered in Boone County Illinois for resisting the law laid down by the Grand Lodge of Illinois. I n his testimony, Whitney said: \"The resistance of the law by Masons, in the case o f the death of Miss Slade, was well known to the Grand Lo dge and their committees, who approved it and this Lodg e (Belvedere #6, F.A.M.) has quietly acquiesced; and having their charter restored by the present Grand Master, several of the most culpable of its members have been elect ed to the most important positions in the Lodge.\" (UNQ). This action was taken by Master Masons who had full knowledge of the crime they were covering up, as well adequately pro ven in court. These murderers resisted the law of the State of Illinois and escaped its consequences through the machinations of high ranki ng Masons in the Judicial system. Pres. C. G. Finney, himself a Mason, characterized Masonry as follows:"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"\"Freemasonry has no mercy, but swears candidates to avenge violations of Masonic obligations, the most unlawful and un-Christian deeds; to deliver each ot her from difficulty, whether right or wrong; to unduly favor Masons in business transactions.

Because of the Masonic murder of William Morgan, fa cts came to light by testimony of witnesses before the courts; by action of the New York State Legislature, and the defense of Morgan's assassins by the Grand Lodge of Rhode Island. All this was led by John Quincy Adams Page 188 initiating an investigation of Masonry, from a pure ly patriotic viewpoint. Here are his views as expressed in his ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS. This is only part of his address: \"I saw a code of Masonic legislation adopted to pro strate every principle of justice and to corrupt every sen timent of virtuous feeling in the soul of him who bound his allegiance to it. I saw the practice of common hone sty, of Christian benevolence, even the abstinence of atroc ious crimes, limited exclusively by lawless oaths and ba rbarous penalties to the sacred relations between the broth erhood of the craft. I saw slander organized into a secret wi despread and affiliated agency, fixing its invisible fangs i nto the hearts of its victims, sheltered by the darkness of the Lodge room, and armed with never ceasing penalties of dea th.

As a Master Mason, he was required by the M aster to attend a meeting where he was charged with making derogatory remarks against the Lodge. For several hours he was harangued, hara ssed and insulted. When he was finally allowed to defend himself, he t old how he had spoken against the Lodge, because he had the right of free opinion and freedom of speech and liberty of the press all of w hich were God-given rights which could not be controlled by the Lodge. He stated that these rights had been Notes:- 1. Bernard, Light on Freemasonry, p.5. Wagner, Freemasonry, pp. 555, 556. Page 189 purchased by the blood of his fathers. Yet his requ est to defend himself was refused. Soon after this he was expelled from the Lodge and a vicious campaign of vilification was launched against him.

It was in this p rison that I was \"saved\" and promised God to do everything within my power to see that the terrible things I had seen in South Korea would never happen here. I did not mention Jews, Jewry, or Zionism in this mes sage. The meeting ended about 10 p.m. Page 190 The next morning, a Letter to the Editor appeared i n the Denver Post, some 70 miles away. It was written by a Jewish lady in which she expressed shock at the terrible anti-Semitic langua ge I used and said that my statements reminded her of Adolf Hitler. Now any one with any common sense, would know that a letter written afte r 10 p.m. the night before, could never arrive in Denver in time for a midnight \"deadline.\" It was quite obvious this letter had been written befo re I arrived in La Porte. Interestingly enough, there had been no Jewish lady at the Sunday night meeting.
