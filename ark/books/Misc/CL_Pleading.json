The late Dean Alison Reppy, with whom I was associated in teaching tIx~ subject of Common Law Pleading, and who devoted much of his life to study in the field, commenced this work in an effort to meet the need for a new comprehensive work on the subject, but an untimely death cut his ef forts short. I was at the time in a position to assume this undertaking, and have worked over the many succeeding years upon the preparation of this work. The responsibility for that a ppears in these pages is therefore mine. It is my hope that this work will be of assistance to members of the bench, bar, and students of the law, in their professional and scholarly pur suits, I will briefly describe some of the principal features of this work, which are directed towards this end. First: Substantial new materials have been introduced into this work, in addition to the retention of the basic materials included in the Shipman tex t. This results in the presentation of a wider area of coverage in terms of topics dealt with than is generally found in previous works on Common Law Pleading. A reference to the detailed table of contents will indicate the topics covered with some particu larity. Second: In discussions of many of the topics, more has been included in the way of historical background and development than generally ap pears in previous comprehensive works on Common Law Pleading. Third: Many of the topics have been more exte nsively treated than is generally the case in comprehensive works on Common Law Pleading. It has always been my view that significant emphasis should be placed upon materials dealing with the forms of action. Certainly most members of the bench, bar, and s tudents of the law, carry with them the memory of Professor F. W. Maitland’s incisive and perceptive observation that, “The forms of action we have buried, but they still rule us from their graves.” This fact has remained too clearly in focus to be blurred from vision by the Codes, and it is considered at some length in the pages of this work. The apportionment of additional space and emphasis is not limited to the forms of action, but is found in the treatment of many of the other top ics throughout this work. This is done with a recognition of the validity of Justice Oliver Wendell Hohnes’ statement that, “whenever we trace a leading doctrine of substantive law far enough back, we are very likely to find some forgotten circumstance of procedure at its sou rce.” And to this we may add that whenever we deal with a modern procedural rule, we are likely to gain a better understanding of it, and a utility for its application, by virtue of a knowledge of Common Law Pleading. Fourth: The status under Modern Codes , Practice Acts and Rules of Court of most of the principal procedural"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 5 of 735 devices, including all of the forms of action, is considered in the discussion of each of these topics. The vi - xvii PREFACE tality and usefulness of a knowledge of Common Law Pleadin g may be readily appreciated when we find that its concepts are still present, and underlie the various aspects of Modern Pleading and Practice. Fifth: Extensive bibliographies of treatises and articles appear at substantially all of the points where the principal topics are discussed. Citations of treatises generally include edition and place and date of publi cation, so as to make the sources more readily available. Such extensive bibliographies have not been included in the earlier comprehensive works o n Common Law Pleading, and it is hoped that this may have the effect of making research considerably less taxing, and substantially more produc tive. Sixth: For the English cases, in addition to citations in the original reports, parallel citations in the English Reports, a reprint series, are also generally included. Previous compreheusive works on Common Law Plead ings do not contain these citations, as indeed the English &eports were not yet published when most of them were written. Since law libraries fre quently do not contain the original reports, but do contain the English Re ports, research may be pursued with these citations without the use of conversion tables and digests, which might otherwise be necessary. This, too, should make research easier and more productive for members of the bench, bar, and students of the law. The decisions, both English and American, have been extensively cited in order to convey an understanding of Common Law Pleading in its early, middle, and later stages, its development, and its effect in Modern Plead ing and Practice. I can, of course, do no more than to record my indebtedness to the late Dean Alison Reppy, who commenced this work with such enthusiasm and dedication d uring his lifetime. I am also indebted to Shipman’s work, and to the works of the many other outstanding authors who have con tributed so much in the field of Common Law Pleading. Any attempt to recite all of their names at this point would result in the i nevitable risk of omission, and I will therefore ask the reader to take notice of their respec tive contributions as he makes use of this work. I also wish to express my appreciation to my colleague, Professor John It. Dugan, for generously giving of his t ime to discuss with me certain of the topics included in this work. And for the secretarial services so faithfully performed by Mrs. Amy Smith in working upon the manuscript, I express my appreciation. I have attempted to set out some of the characteristi cs of this work in the succinct form required of prefatory remarks, and sincerely hope that this work will serve the purposes for which it is intended.

In the latter part of the Eighteenth and early part of the Nineteenth Centuries, under the impetus of Bentharn’s searing criticism of the existing System of Law in England, with its Courts, its Special Pleading, and its gen eral atmosphere of Delay and Administrative Inefficiency, these restrictive influences be - caine clear to the people, a demand for Re form sprang up and the movement for the improvement of procedure slowly got under way, The impact of this development, strangely enough, first bore fruit in America in the State of Louisiana, with the framing of Liv ingston’s Code of Practice ~ and the Penal Code in 1824, wh ich latter was never adopt ed.~ This was followed in England by the adoption of the Rilary Rules in 1834,6 and 3. “The Remedial Part of the Law resembled a mass of patchwork, made up at intervals and by pIece meal, withoutany preconceived plan or system, for the purpose of meeting the exigencies of the times by temporary expedientt” Walker’s Introduction to American Law, Pt, VI, Lecture xxxv, 569 (11th Cd., Boston, 1905). 4.

In this connection it should be recalled that progress in the Reform of Criminal Procedure has followed up and to some extent paralleled the Reform of the Civil Procedure which has been under way since 1848. In 1930 the American Law Institute issued its Code of Criminal Procedure, which has subse quently substantially influenced State Criminal Pro cedural Developments In the Several States, In 1941, pursuant to the rule - making authority granted to the Supreme Cou rt by Congress, the AdvIsory Committee on Rules of Criminal Procedure was ap pointed by the Court, which published two Pre llmiaary Drafts, with motes, and its Final Report to the Court in July. 1944.

Like the individ ual, so with the Commo n - Law System of Pro cedure, which we all proudiy claim as a price less part of our Anglo - Saxon heritage, we may change, we may add to or take away those Parts of the System which have out grown their usefulness, just as the Modern Common - Law Actions supers eded the Old Real Actions 16 when they became archaic, but it is no more possible, in any realistic sense, to abolish the System in its entirety, with all its implications for both the past and the future, than it is for an individual to destroy his ancest ry, or for mankind to abol ish history or civilization. • Infinite damage has been done to the cause of legitimate Legal Reform, to the cause of 16, The old Real Actions fell under one of the heads of Blackstone’ s famous classification of Actions as Real, Personal and Mixed. The Real Actions were by far the most important during the early develop mental period of the Common Law. Included there in were Writs of Right Proper and Writs in the Na ture of Writs of Rigb ~ such Writs, among others, as the Writ of Right de rationabili parte, the Writ of Advowson, the Writ of Dower, the Writ of Dower wide nihul Rabet, and the Writ of quare impedit. These actions were feudal In character and were concerned with disputes over land. Because of the technIcalities required Ia their Control and the length of tUne Involved in carrying their process through, these actions, along wIth those which fell under the other two heads, were gradually super seded by what are now known as the E leven Mod ern Common - Law Personal Actions, as a result of evolutionary steps In the development of the Com mon Law. What had, In effect, long before occurred as a matter of practice, was officially recognized by the Real Property Limitation Act of 1883, 3 & 4 Wni. IV, e. 27, § 36, which swept aside the Real and Mixed Actions, with certain exceptions, effective December 31, 1834. Legal Education, at the expense of litigants, students of law, and the public welfare gener ally, by proclaiming the concept that all that has gone before in our procedural ancestry should be regarded as obsolete and worth less,’ 7 and is not to be considered in terms of Modem Pleading and Practice, aid in terms of Modern Legal Education - Those who take this limited view have clearly confused the real merits of the Common - Law System with those portions of the System which were needlessly technical, thus overlooking the salient fact that it had developed many sound and enduring principles of legal procedure. They have also overlooked t he fact that there is greater similarity in the essential princi ples underlying Pleading at Common Law, in Equity, under Modern Codes and Practice Acts, and even under the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure now in effect in the Fed eral Courts, than is generally realized.’ 8 17. Sir Montague Crackeuthorpe, O.C., in an address to the American Bar Association, in reference to the utility of the study of Common - Law Pleading stat ed:”Jn the hands of those who understood it, the System of Common - Law Pleading was infallible iii attaining the purpose for which it existed. If all who brought Causes to Trial had possessed a prop er acquaintance with this Branch of Law and a rea sonable mental alertness, it would never have beer, hinted that Pleading was a means of turning the decision of a question from ‘the very Right of the Matter’ to immaterial points. But pleaders of in ferlor and slovenly mental disposition suffered themselves to be misled, deliberately It is to be feared, by theft’ more acute br ethren; arid the pop — ular mind came to consider the whole system a mere series of traps and pitfalls for the unwary, — an Impediment to Justice that must be abolished. In truth, even these evils might well have been rem edied by allowing free liberty of am endment, and reducing to a moderate sum the costs payable on the grant of such privilege. Those concerned in i’e form movements, however, often lose sight of their real object In a feverish anxiety to ‘cut deep’ and at once; and this explains why the syste m for bringing a cause to trial In convenient and exact form was discarded.” Note, Common Law Pleading, 10 Harv.L.Rcv. 238, 239 (1896). 1*. “There Is no rule regulating the substance of Pleadings under the Codes which Is not either taken directly from the older system, or framed by anal ogy Ia the application of the same principles. The BASIS OF MODERN REMEDIAL LAW Cit I Moreover, the essential elements of causes of action which must be Pleaded have not been abolished by the Reformed Procedure, nor exper ience of the past thirty years has demonstrat ed that the Codes have by no means brought about that perfect completeness and simplicity in all Forms of Legal Procedure hoped for and predicted by their supporters, and expected, perhaps, during the earlier y ears of their adoptiun.” Shipman, Code Pleading: The Aid of the Earlier Systems, 7 Yale L.J. 197 (1398). “The Problems and Functions and Principles of Plead ing are essentially the same in all systems, wheth er at Common Law, under the Code, Ia Equity, or by Rule of Court.” Shipman, Handbook of Com mon - Law Pleading, Introduction, 7, 8 (3d ed. by Ballantine, St. Paul, 1923). Thus, in Minnesota, Ia the ease of Solomon v, Vinson, Si MInn, 205, 17 NW. 340 (1883), a Code Complaint which alleged, amon g other things, that the defend ant was indebted to the plaintiff on an Account Past Due, for Goods Sold and Delivered, was held to contain an the Allegations necessary to consti tute a good Indebtedness count in an Action of Debt at Common Law, the Court remarking thet “under that System of Pleading It was just as necessary to allege the Facts as it is under the Code.” in Crump V. MIms, 04 NC. 707, 771 (1370), Rodman, 3., declared: “We take occasion here to suggest to pleaders that the Rules of the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 21 of 735 Common Law as to Pleading, which are only the rules of logic, have not been abolished by The Code. Pleas should not state the Evidence, but the Facts, which are the Conclusions from the Evidence, according to their legal effect; and compl aints should especially avoid wandering Into matter which if traversed would not lend to a decisive Issue. It is the Object of all Pleading to arrive at some Single, Simple and Ma terial Issue.” In accord: Parsley & Co. v. Nicholson, 85 NC. 207, 210 (lSfl ). Campbell, 3,, In Henry mv.

As Lord Mansfield so well said: “The Substantial Rules of Pleading are founded in strong sense, and in the soundest and closest logic; and so appear, when well understood and explained; though, by being misunderstood and misapplied, they are made use of as instruments of chicane.” 1~ fi~ a result of such misapplication and chicanery by men who resorted to the technicalities of Special Pleading to serve their own selfish ends, as a result of the portrayal by its en emies of the System as a mere game of skill, in which the helpless litigant became a pawn in a wilderness of arbitrary technicality and confusion; in which it was pictured as the master and not the servant of the courts, or as an end in itself, instead of an instrument for the fair and equitable adjustments of sub stantive human rights, the Sys tem of Plead ing and Procedure as developed at Common Law, was gradually brought into popular dis repute by the efforts of well - meaning Re formers, who emphasized its admitted De fects, but failed to point out to the people of England and the United States the matchless precision of the Old System as a vehicle for reducing human controversies into distinct Issues of Fact or of Law, which could be sat isfactorily adjusted, thus achieving the prin cipal end of all government, to wit, the pres ervation of Law and Order.

But this attempt to abolish all species, and establish a single genus, is found to be beyond the power of legislative omnipotence. They cannot compel the human mind not to distinguish between things that differ.

Ramsey, 61 U.S. (20 How.) 523, 525, 15 LEd. 1010, 1011 ( 1857). According to Professor Keigwin, Cases in Code Plead ing, 16 (Rochester, N. Y. 1926), the Code has been of doubtful value In simplifying procedure: “One who will read the Reports of New York or of any other Code State will observe that before the Re form comparatively few Cases turned upon points of pleading, and that most of such eases involved ques tions of Substantive Law which were presented in technical guise by reasons of their Development upon the Record; it will also be observed that the adopt ion of the Code was at once followed by a large Increase of litigation concerning procedural matters, which kind of litigation shows no present signs of abatement. Indeed, the current digests dis close an immensely greater number of cases decid ing pure Ma tters of Pleading in the Code States than eases of that kind coming from Common Law Jurisdictions. One reason, of course, is that the Common Law system is so thoroughly settle’] that few novel questions can arise.” This problem under the Codes is also disc ussed in Sun derland, Cases on Procedure Annotated, Code Plead ing, Preface viii (Chicago, 1913). “‘The love of innovation induced the State of New York some years ago, to abrogate Common - Law Pleading, and introduce a Code of Procedure for the regulation of litigation in her courts; and not withstanding the lamentable confusion and uncer tainty, and the greatly increased expense which has thereby been brought into the Administration of Justice in that State, other States have followed in her track of barba ric empiricism.

THE PLACE OF COMMON - LAW PLEAD ING IN THE LAW 1. Anglo - American Law is divided into Pub - lie Law and Private Law. Private Law is separated in to Substantive Law and Adjective Law, with Common - Law Pleading constituting the first procedural topic thereunder, ANGLO - AMERICAN law has been sepa rated into two main divisions — Public Law — which has to do with the regulation of rela tions between independent states and between a state and its citizens, and — Private Law — which regulates the relations between the citizens of the state. Private law, in turn, is divided into two branches, to wit, Substan tive Law, which defines rights and liabilities, and Adjective or Procedural Law, which fur nishes the ways"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Page 23 of 735 and means of enforcing these rights and liabilities. And Adjective Law, in its broadest aspects and prior to 1848, in cluded (1) Common - Law Pleading; (2) Equi ty Pleading; (3) Evidence , and (4) Trial Practice. The position of Common - Law Pleading in the Law will, therefore, appear clearly from the chart on the next page. As a result of the impact of the New York Code of Procedure in 1848,24 our Modern Sys 23 Apparently the earliest use In America of the phrase, Government by Law as opposed to Govern ment by Men, is found in Part I, Art. 30, of the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780. 24. KY.Laws 1848, c. aia tern of Code Pleading, 25 which is a combina tion of the better elements of the Co mmon Law and Equity Systems of Pleading, came into existence. The influence of this development under the Codes finally led, in 1938, to the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the reg ulation of Practice in the Federal Courts. Following the example of the nation some of the states subsequently abandoned their Codes in favor of a System of Procedural Regulation by Rule of Court. This treatise, however, is concerned primarily with the fundamental principles of Civil Pleading and Practice as developed a t Common Law. And Civil Procedure is “the mode of proceeding by which a legal right is enforced, as distin guished from the law which gives or defines the right.” 26 25. “Code Pleading is the term applied to the Re formed System of Pleading initiated by t he New York Code of 1848 and now in force in - , - American jurisdictions. It Is this latter system which concerns us in this book. But since it de veloped from the former systems and in many re spects continues various details and parts of them, it is nece ssary to consider the antecedents of Code pleading in the other systems.” Clark, Handbook of the Law of Code Pleading, c. 1, History, Systems, and Functions of Pleading, 4 (2d ed,, St. Paul 1947). 26.

For a definition of Procedure, compare the following: “Procedure may be defined as a Series of Symbolic Actions, generally accompanied by words, nnd, in developed societies, by the Exhibition of Written Documents, by means of which Rights or Liberties gua ranteed by a society are reasserted by its in dividual members. ReassertIon Is the Essence of Procedure; for in the sense in which we shall use the term — the sense of regaining before a competent court a status that has been lost or questioned — it assumes an already violattd right.” Greenidge, The Legal Procedure of Cicero’s Time, Introduction, 1 (Oxford 1901).

A mere Mechanic of the Law may get in and out of the court, but often to the detri ment of the client’s interest, and in a manner destructive of the standards of the legal pro fession. If, however, he desires to become an Artisan of the Law, to fully appreciate the significance of the Refo rmed Procedure and the procedural tools used for the protection of his client’s interest, he must understand the fabric of the Common Law out of which they have been constructed. In order to do this he must be conversant with the evolu tionary steps which led up to our Modern System of Procedure. In short, unless a law yer is sufficiently expert in handling the pro cedural devices avai]able under the Law, any knowledge which he acquires concerning the Substantive Law goes for naught. It thus appears that a mastery of Adjective Law is a prerequisite to a mastery of the Law as a whole if a person hopes to become a success ful lawyer. For as Justice Story so truly said: “No man ever mastered it, (Special Pleading) who was not by that very means made a profound lawyer.” ~ It is necessary, therefore, that every individual who desires to become a serious Student of the Law should have a full appreciation of the impor tance of Common - Law Pleading. In the first place the study of Common - Law Pleading is important because through 28.

Sec. 2 IMPORTANCE OF COMMON - LAW PLEADING 11 its study - the stu dent acquires a working ap preciation of the Historical Development of the Law. He comes to realize the relation ship between Procedural and Substantive Law, that Right and Remedy are bound to gether, 2 ° that Substantive Rights are ex pressed in terms of Re medial Rights and Forms of Action. In short, it is essential to realize that the Forms of Action are, in fact, the categories of legal liability, and that most of our Modern Substantive Contract, Tort and Property Law, had its origin in and de veloped out of Procedure, It was in this very connection that Sir Henry Maine ob served that the rules of Substantive Law had the appearance of being “secreted in the in - terstices of Procedure.” 3° What Maine was saying was that the study of the Forms of Action is one of the richest sources of infor mation for the student of legal development and theory, that there can be no true under standing of the Law except as against its Historical Background and that this history can only be fully and intelligently interpreted i n the light of the Origin and Growth of Pro cedure. 3~ 29 - Mait]and clearly had this in mind when, in re ferring to the dependence of Eight upon Remedy, as illustrated by the Common Law Forms of Action, he declared: “The Forms of Action we have buried, but they still rule us from their graves.” The Forms of Action at Common Law, Lecture 1, 2 (Cam bridge, 1945). 30. Maine, Early Law and Custom, c. XI, 359 (New York, 1880). But compare the statement of Street, who declared: “ To the modern mind no line of cleavage is more marked than between Substantive and Adjective law. It was not always so. The very term ‘Adjec tive Law’ was first used by Bentham. In early stages of legal growth the two elements are insep arable.” 3 Foundati ons of Legal Liability, e. I, I (Northport, 1000). 31. Sir Montague Craekenthorp, Q,C., in an address to the American Bar Association, in reference to the ntility of the study of Common - Law Pleading, stat ed: “And, so long as Written Pleadings remain, the best masters of the art will be they who can in form the apparent licence of the new system with that spirit of exaethess and self - restraint which In the second place a knowledge of Com mon - Law Procedure is essential as an aid in understanding the early En glish and Amen - can decisions in which Rulings on the Law are only - comprehensible to the Modem Stu dent in the light of a working knowledge of Pleading at Common Law. The Issues in these early cases, framed at a period of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Page 26 of 735 time when it was not yet certain whether the Pleadings should be English, French, or Lat - - in, and while they were still in their Develop2~ mental Stage, 32 were necessarily formulated on the basis of the Older System. In conse quence, the opinions rendered in these cases are sometimes in language and phraseology understandable only by one versed in the Common - Law System of Procedure. Thus, the phrase “the lessor of the plaintiff” is tin derstandable only in the light of the Fiction of Ejectment; the doctrine of quid pro quo has meaning onl y to one who has studied the early cases involving Debt; and an “executed consideration” is meaningful only against the historical development of Assuinpsit out of the Tort action of Trespass on the Case Super So Assumpsit. Moreover, one called upon to con sider a decision in the Year Books ~ might be struck by the inclusion of much material or discussion which had no apparent bearing upon the final result. 3 ’ But such inclusion would be clear to one acquaint ed with the History of Pleading, particularly that Stage of it in which the Pleadings were settled in the heat of battle, in the presence of one’s adversary, arid by a process of Oral Altercation in which the Litigants, the En ilows from a knowledge of the old.” Note, Common Law Pleading, 10 Earv.L,Iles - . 238 (1896). 22.

Second, the shadings between the Common - Law Forms of Action afford the student ex cellent practice in distinguis hing one decision from another. Third, no educational device is comparable to a course on Common - Law Pleading for the purpose of teaching the be ginner how to brief a case, reduce the con troversy to a single, clear - cut, well - defined Issue of Fact or of La w, determine the hold ing of the Court and formulate the Rule and Principle of the decision. In short, it is an excellent device for extracting, like the roots of an equation, the true points in dispute; it is a time4ested scheme of matchless preci sion fo r separating the Issues of Fact from the Issues of Law, for the purpose of refer ring the case to the Court or the Jury. Finally, it gives the Student a valuable in sight into the problem of what constitutes a Cause of Action, which is a necessary tech niq ue under any System of Procedure.

In making a study of Pleading at Common Law the student is not dealing with Rules which are obsolete and without intimate relation to the Existing Law. The fundamental principles of Com mon - Law Procedure still prevail; only its technical and archaic characteristics have been abolished by Modem Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court. This is true be cause Code Pleading springs from a Com mon - Law Ancestry; because Codification at best is only partial in scope, hence the prin ciple s of Common - Law Pleading necessarily remain as the great Residuary Law from which the gaps in the Code System of Proce dure have been and will continue to be filled, 18 and against the background of which its every provision must be construed and un derstoo d. Thus, to give but one example, the Code states that “the Complaint must be stated in plain and concise language,” which calls for"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Page 27 of 735 explanation or interpretation. Does it actually mean what it says or does it mean something else? After full consideration the Courts have found that at Common Law the Declaration, in order to state a good Cause of Action, was required to state Ultimate Facts, and not Evidentiary Facts and not Conclusions of Law, and that the Rule under the Statutory Provision in question is t he same as at Common Law. 3° The provision therefore, has no meaning except as con strued against its Common - Law Background. With a statement in mind of the reasons why a knowledge of Common - Law Pleading is important, it may next be helpful to con sider th e Functions of Pleading. 38. “Alt those preexisting Rules [of Pleading, at Com mon Law or in Equity~ which are not expressly abrogated, and which can properly be made applica ble under the ne~v system [the Code) remain in force.” Selden, J., in Rochester City Bank & Lester v.

BASJS OF MODERN REMEDJAL LAW Sec. 3 FUNCTIONS OF PLEADING 13 THE FUNCTIONS OF PLEADING AT COMMON LAW’° 3. The Functions of Plea ding at Common Law ate six in number and may be listed as follows: (I) The first or Primary Function of Pleading is to reduce the contro versy between the Parties to a sin gle, clear - cut, well - defined Issue of Fact or of Law; (ii) To reduce Questions of Fact to clear - cut Issues by eliminating imma terial and incidental matter, thus narrowing the ease to one or more specific propositions on which the controversy turns, thus operating as an aid to the Court in admitting or rejecting offers of evidence; (III) To notify the Parties and the Court of the respective Claims, Defenses, and Counter - Demands of the ad versaries; (IV) To serve as an index to the respective Counsel as to the Points to be Proved at the Trial and as a Guide to the Court in Apportioning the Burden of Proof and Rebuttal as between the plaintiff and defend ant; (V) To serve as a Formal Basis for the Judgment; (VI) To preserve a Record of the Con troversy Litigated and to create a foundation for the Plea of Res Judicata, thus preventing a reliti gation of the same controversy be tween the same Parties at a later date. THE principal reason why many ordinary controversies are utterly fruitless and incon clusive is that prior to the discussion there is no asce rtainment by the contending parties of the Issues at stake. If every discussion were preceded by a clear - cut settlement of 40. “The Function of Pleadings then is to ascertain with precision the matters on which the par ties differ and the points on which they agree; and thus to arrive at certain clear Issues on which both par ties desire a judicial decision,” Odgers, Principles of Pleading and Practice, e. 6, 67 (14th ed., by Lewis Sturge, London 1952). the questions in dispute, it would not prove difficult to settle the actual differences be tween the disputants, and in many instances it would develop that there was in reality no difference of opinion. 41 Pleading, which is a Statement in a Logical, Legal Form of the Fact s which constitute the Plaintiff’s Cause of Action or the Defendant’s Ground of De fense, 42 is designed to prevent the presenta tion of such fruitless and immaterial contro - versies in Courts of Law. The Functions of Pleading, therefor, have been developed with this end in mind. The first or Primary Function of Pleading is to reduce the controversy between the Par ties to a single, clear - cut, well - defined Issue ~ of Fact or of Law, or, stated in another way, to Separate Issues of Law from Issues of Fact 4 ’ s o that the Issues of Law might be"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Page 28 of 735 41.

This was made necessary by the dual character of the Common - Law Tribunal, that is, of the Court, which generally decides Questions of Law, and the Jury, which gen - erally determines Issues of Fact. By this process the Matters on which the Parties dif fer and the Points on which they agree, are ascertained with precision, and thus the Is sues over which the Parties are contending are presented for judicial determination. The Pleadings are not, as frequently assumed in popular estimation, an advocate’s address to the Judge or Jury. On the contrary they are the Formal Statements, dra wn up by the Counsel of the Respective Parties, of the plaintiff’s Cause of Action or the Defendant’s Defenses, From the clash of assertions are disclosed the points in controversy, the prop ositions affirmed on one side and denied on the other, on which t he decision of the case will turn. Thus, the Primary Function of Pleading, that is, of defining the Issues over which the Parties are contending, is achieved. “The points admitted by either side are thus extracted and distinguished from those in controvers y; other matters, though disputed, may prove to be immaterial; and thus the litigation is narrowed down to two or three matters which are the real questions in dis pute,” ~ on which the case may be judicially tried in the most expeditious manner. It is a great benefit to the Parties to know exactly what are the Facts remaining in dis pute, and what Facts the plaintiff must Prove to sustain his Cause of Action or the defend ant to establish his Defense. The question involved may be reduced to an Issue of La w, in which case it may be decided by the Judge upon Argument, or it may involve a Question of Fact, in which case, it may involve a lengthy Trial by Jury. By separation of Questions of Law from Questions of Fact, the Parties may be saved great trouble and ex ‘5• Odgers, Principles of Pleading and Practice In Civil Actions in the High Court of Justice, e. 6, 66 (14th ed., London 1952). pense in procuring evidence of Facts which the opponent does not dispute, and the State may escape the burden and cost of su pervising the litigation of Immaterial Issues. The secotul Objective of Pleading is to re duce Questions of Fact to clear - cut Issues, by eliminating immaterial and incidental mat ters, and narrowing the case to one or more definite propositions on which the contro versy really turns, thus serving as a guide to the Court in Rulings upon Offers of Evidence. As the Pleadings define and limit the Proof, so also do they have a bearing upon the Ad mission or Rejection of Evidence. Thus, if A brings Tr espass for Assault and Battery, B Pleads Self - Defense, and A denies the striking in Self - Defense, the issue presented is: Did B strike in Self - Defense? Now, if B offers Evidence that he did not strike A, the Court is in a position to Rule out the Offer of Proof, as such offer has no logical tend ency to support the defendant’s Plea that he struck in Self - Defense. The third Objective of Pleading is to notify the Parties themselves and the Tribunal which is to decide between them of the it spective Claims, D efenses, arid Cross - De mands of the adversaries. Some Advocates of Reform, irritated by the mischiefs inci dent to the abuse of technical Rules of Plead ing, have suggested that the Parties to an Action should come into court without any Notice as to the C omplaint or Answer. It is evident, however, that such a"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Page 29 of 735 System would lead to fraud, oppression and expense in a civilized state where commercial transactions are both numerous and complicated. If, then, Notice is essential, does a mere Gen eral Notice 40 o f the Plaintiff’s Cause of Ac 4~. Issue Pleading, as opposed to Notice Pleading, prevailed at Common Law, as the chief Objective of Pleading was to reduce the controversy to an issue of fact or or law. Fact Pleading came in with Code Pleading, which emph asizes the need for an accu rate statement of the facts, while in recent yenrs there has developed what Is known as Notice Plead - Sec. 3 FUNCTIONS OF PLEADING 15 tion and the Defendant’s Ground of Defense, serve every purpose? Thus, suppose the Plaintiff’ s Declaration reads as follows: “The Plaintiff Alleges that the defendant did not pay a bill of exchange for $50.00.” to whièh the defendant interposes the following Plea: “The defendant states that he is not liable on the bill.” From the Plaintiff’ s Statement it could not be determined on the Pleadings whether he had a sufficient Cause of Action or not, and from the Defendant’s Plea, it coUld not be de tennined whether the defendant denied the acceptance of the bill, or the other legal req uisites e ssential to liability; or, assuming their existence, whether the defendant in tended to set up New Matter such as fraud by Way of Answer; nor whether the Issue was One of Law or of Fact. In such a situa tion every case would have to be considered by a Jury in order to ascertain that there was no Fact in dispute. It thus appears that the evils of giving no Notice would exist nev ertheless, expense would be incurred as the Parties would have to come to Trial prepared to Offer Proof on anything relating to the case, although only one matter was in reality in dispute. It seems evident, therefore, that ing, or merely giving notice to an opponent of the claim which is being asserted. On Issue and Fact pleading, see Clark, Handbook of the Law of Code Pleading, c.

See. 4 DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW 17 extent of its adaptation of its Rules to the accomplishment of its Main Functions, that is, Fair Notice to the Parties and the ac curate, practical and systematic presentation of the precise Questions of Law and Fact in volvéd to the Tribunal which is to decide them. The various and possible Functions of Pleading may, the refore, be enumerated as follows: (1) To reduce the controversy between the Parties to a single, clear - cut well - defined Is sue of Fact or of Law, and to separate Issues of Law from Issues of Fact, so that the Issues of Law may be determined as far as poss ible in advance of the Trial of the Facts; (2) To reduce Questions of Fact to clear - cut Issues by eliminating immaterial and in cidental matters, and na rrowing the case to one or more specific propositions on which the controversy really turns, thus operating as an aid to the Court in Admitting or Re jecting Offers of Evidence; (3) To notify the Parties themselves and the Deciding Tribunal of the respect ive Claims, Defenses and Counter - Demands of the Adversaries; (4) To serve as an index to the respective Counsel as to the Points to be Proved at the Trial and as a Guide to the Court in Appor tioning the Burden of Proof and Rebuttal as between the plainti ff and defendant; (5) To serve as a Formal Basis for the Judgment; (6) To preserve a Record of the Contro versy Litigated and to create a foundation for a Plea of Res Judicata, thus preventing a relitigation of the same controversy be tween the same part ies at a later date. It thus becomes clear that historically, the principal purpose of the Rules of Pleading has been to compel each person to state the essential elements of his Cairn or Defense in order to arrive at an Issue. It has not always been true that Common - Law Pleading has ac complished the objective of reducing all cas es to definite Issues, this end being defeated on occasion by resort to technical procedural devices which had outgrown their days of usefulnes s. 52 But in both Common - Law and Code Pleading, the Issue - Raising Function far overshadows the Notice - Giving One, and is the source of the Principal Rules of Plead ing. It is so under the Modern English Plead ing. The case must be analyzed and reduced to Is sues at the Trial, if not before, and it is inexpedient to postpone this essential pre liminary to the day of Trial."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Page 32 of 735 THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW OUT OF PROCEDURE 4.

V, § 5, 155 (Boston, 1000). 18 BASIS OF MODERN REMEDIAL LAW Ch. 1 In fact the Law grew up in exactly the op posite way, Courts being organized to handle a series of specific cases, the decisions of which gradually developed theories of rights and liabilities. In short, our rights and lia bilities as defined by Substantive Law, had their origin in and developed out of Proce dural Law. If this be true, how d id it come about? Let us assume that A and B are ship wrecked and land on the proverbial uninhab ited, deserted island. A, quickly recovering from the shock, shakes the water off, works his way up to a nearby knoll, where the ground is level and the view good, and says: “I like this place; I think I shall take posses sion,” Who owns that knoll? A owns it by reason of having first acquired possession, by reason of his strong right arm. As a re sult he may also be said to have acquired a moral but not a legal right to retain posses sion. Some time later, B pulls himself to gether, and discovers A on the knoll. An - ty - ing there, he surveys the prospect with satis faction equal to that of A, and then, after pondering over the situation, dec lares: “I like this knoll too; I think I shall take it.” “Oh, no you won’t,” exclaims A; “This knoll belongs to me.” “Oh, yes I will,” retorts B. “Oh, no you won’t,” bristles A; whereupon B, abandoning further argument, strikes A over the head with a club, and takes possession. Now, who owns the knoll? B. By what right? Not by a moral right, as A preceded him in possession in point of time; not by a legal right, because in the absence of a Court in which a remedy couid be sought, no such right yet existed. In reality B now owns the knoll by right of the strong arm; by right of might, that being at the moment the only Law in effect on the island. Without going into the evolutionary devel opments involved, let us say that time moves on, and later we find that other members have joined the society of A and B — men, women, and children, After this develop - ment, C) hits D over the head with a club; the blow glances off D’s head and strikes E, the child of a third party, Immediately there is great excitement in the community, The people crowd together, and someone is heard to say: “As long as A and B were the only inhabitants on this island, this business of their hitting one another over the head was their own affair; but now that there are oth ers here, we must do something to control such actions.” But “What can we do” ex claimed the others! At this point someone suggested that the group shouid select a lead er, hail the individuals before that leader, who would then hear both sides of the con troversy and render a decision. Accordingly, the group chose its fastest runner, its wisest counselor, its best medicine man, its most esteemed religious adviser, or its greatest military leader, escorted him to the edge of the forest, and set him up on a stump to de cide the controversy, Thus, was the Court or Tribunal created; thus, did the group take its first step in the Development of the Law; thus, did it prepare the way for transforming moral into legal rights. Then the group took C, D, and E before the newly created tr ibu nal, In turn D and E were required to tell their story, and C was permitted"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Page 33 of 735 to present his side, Before any decision was rendered the most that could be said in favor of D and F was that in the view of the group, their moral ri ght not to be interfered with had been violated; as yet they had no legal rights as they were still without a remedy. After hearing both sides of the controversy, let us assume that the Court, presided over by the chosen leader, who has now become a Judge, fines C twenty hides, ten hides to go to the injured Parties, ten hides to go to the Com munity. At the moment of decision, I) and F for the first time had acquired a legal right not to be struck, the moral right having been changed into a legal right thr ough the ac quisition of a legal remedy. Let us now as - Sec. 5 sume further that after two or three similar episodes of this kind, in which the B’s and C’s were fined for having struck someone, the wiser members of the group, while wending their way home from the Court, began to reason somewhat as follows: If, when B strikes A over the head with a club, he is hailed before a Court and punished, it must be because A had a right not to be struck; if A has such a right, then B must be under a duty not to viol ate it; if B does violate A’s right not to be struck and his own duty not to strike, B commits a wrong for which he may be held liable, Thus, the concepts of right and duty,M of wrong and liability, are merely different sides of the same shield. If the rig hts violated involved a breach of duty to the community or state, the accused was said to be guilty of a criminal wrong whereas if the rights violated were concerned with breaches of duties as between indi viduals of the group or society, the ac cused were said to be guilty of a civil wrong. But at this stage of the discussion, the im - portant point to be observed in the foregoing account is that these primitive legal concepts of right, duty, wrong and liability, had their Origin in and Developed out of Proc edure, that is, out of the process by which a myriad of single instances, of specific factual situa tions, were presented to and decided by a Court; that the Substantive Law right of A, D, and E not to be struck, came into exist ence only upon the pronounc ement of Judge ment by the Tribunal. This process not only produced a body of Substantive Contract, Property and Tort Law, but it also exercised, as we shall see, a profound effect upon the Form of our Judi cial Organization, which in turn developed the five great Systems of Administrative, Admiralty, Common, Equity and Probate Law. 19 RELATION OF COMMON - LAW PLEADING TO OTHER SYSTEMS 5. The Nature and Function of Pleading at Common Law may be better underst ood when viewed in its relationship to the Other Sys tems of Procedure which developed prior to, contemporaneous with, or even subsequent to it, including Equity and Code Pleading, as well as Pleading under the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. IN order to give a better perspective of the Nature and Function of Common - Law Plead ing as a factor in Anglo - Saxon Law, it may be well to consider its relation to the other Systems of Procedure which developed prior to, contemporaneous with, or even subse quent to it. These include Equity and Code Pleading, as well as Pleading under the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the rela tionship of which to Common - Law Pleading will now be considered. Relation to Equity Pleading EQUITY Pleading was the System of Plead ing which was developed by the Courts of Equity in England, through the King’s ex ercise of a portion of his Judicial Preroga tive in cases involving matters of conscience. The King’s authority was in the beginning handled through his Chancellor who was a Churchman trained in the Canon or Ecclesi astical Law, which had its roots in the Ro man Law, hence it is not surprising to find that Both Systems failed to provide a Jury for the Trial of Facts. As a result of this charact eristic, certain differences between the Common Law and Equity Systems of Procedure developed. In the first place, at Law, the Pleadings at Common Law were required to reduce the controversy to a single, clear - cut, well - de fined Issue of Fact or of Law, w hereas in Equity, there could be as many Issues of Law or of"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Page 34 of 735 Fact as the Pleaders desired. This was due to the dual character of the Common - Law Court, which consisted of the Judge, who normally decided Questions of Law, and RELATION OF PLEADING TO OTHER SY STEMS 54. See Langdell, A Brief Survey of Equity Jurisdic tion, 1 Harv,Lj3ev. 55 (1837), 20 BASIS OF MODERN REMEDIAL LAW Ch. 1 the Jury, which decided Questions of Fact, as opposed to the Equity Court, consisting of the Chancellor only, who was a trained L aw yer, capable of handling Complicated Issues of Both Law and Fact. Secondly, and largely as a result of the first difference between the Two Systems, at Law, a plaintiff, in order to state a cause of action was required to state Ultimate Facts, and not Evidentiary Facts or Conclusions of Law, whereas, in Equity, he might plead Ultimate Facts, Evidentiary Facts, and even Conclu sions of Law, as the Chancellor could unravel the Issues in spite of the resulting confusion. Thirdly, at Common Law only those Par ties who had an interest in the right being litigated could be joined as plaintiffs and only those Parties who were subject to a joint lia bility could be joined as defendants, where as, in Equity, the procedure for the joinder of parties plaintiff and defendant was much more flexible. Fourthly, at Common Law, a Party was frequently entitled to Trial by Jury as a mat ter of right, and if the Jury returned a Ver dict in favor of such Party, its finding on the Facts was binding on the Court, whereas, in Equity, a Party was entitled to Trial by Jury only in the discretion of the Chancellor, and if, perchance, the Jury found in favor of a Party on the Facts, such fin ding was not binding on the Court, was only advisory in its effect, the Chancellor being free to disre gard it in his discretion. Fifthly, at Common Law, a Judgment had to be rendered in favor of or against all the defendants; it could not be split, so as to ap portion the liability among the defendants; whereas, in Equity the Decree could be split up and given against one or all of the defend ants, thus allowing for a much more flexible apportionment of liability, without the neces sity of further action. Sixthly, at Common Law, a Judgment merely determined the matter of right be - tween the Parties; it did not order the de fendant to do anything, and if the defendant was not goaded into action by the mere moral suasion of the Judgment, the plaintiff was c ompelled to sue out an Execution on the Judgment, whereas, in Equity, the Decree not only determined the matter of right be tween the Parties, but it actually ordered the defendant to do something in recognition of that established right on peril of being punished for contempt for failure so to do. Seventhly, at Common Law, only Ques tions of Law were ordinarily open to Appel late Review; if the Error of Law was Ap parent on the Face of the Record, it was Re viewable by Writ of Error; if it was Not Apparen t on the Face of the Record, but was one which occurred at the Trial, prior to the Statute of Westminster II (1285) ,~ the only Method of Review was after Verdict and before Judgment, by a Motion for a New Trial, but, after the Statute, such Errors could b e reached by a Bifi of Exceptions, whereas, in Equity, both Questions of Law and Questions of Fact were Reviewable on Equitable Appeal. With these distinctions between Common Law and Equity Procedure in mind, it be comes readily apparent that when the Cou rt of Equity undertook to settle matters of con science in dispute between private Parties, influenced by the Civil Law background of the Chancellor, it naturally adopted the Civil Law Mode of Procedure, avoiding the Techni cal Rules of Pleading as they ex isted at Com mon Law. In theory, however, in Equity, as at Common Law, the forensic Altercations between the Parties might be carried to an unlimited extent, thus permitting the plain tiff and defendant through Alternate Allega tions to frame Issues of Law or of Fact upon which the Court could base a Decree. In framing his statement of a cause of action in what was called a “Bill in Equity” as op 5~. 13 Ethv. I. Sec. 5 RELATION OF PLEADING TO OTHER SYSTEMS"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Page 35 of 735 21 posed to a “Declaration at Law” , the plaintiff followed no set Form of Action, as at Com mon Law, but proceeded upon the board equi ties involved in the controversy, and stated the Facts at large, mingling both Questions of Féct and of Law, there being no need to separate them on the Re cord as at Law, since they were both to be decided by the Chan cellor, who was trained in the art of sifting from the complicated statements the deter minative Issues; whereas, at Law, Issues of Fact were to be decided by a Jury, while Issues of Law were t o be passed on by the Court, and Both Types of Issues were framed by the Parties, and not as in Equity, extract - ed from the Pleadings by the Court. In prac tice, however, the Pleadings in Equity did not ordinarily go beyond the Replication Stage, and frequ ently not beyond the An swer. What really happened was that each Party stated all the Facts in One Pleading, •though properly belonging to a Subsequent Stage of Pleading, and then these were dealt with as if stated in a regular series of Affirm ative Plead ings in proper order. After An swer filed, the plaintiff might Amend his Bill to anticipate Defenses, upon the new light given him by the defendant, and the defend ant, in turn, was permitted to make a New Answer to the Amended Bill. Thus, the Rep lication was actually sometimes incorporated in the Bill, along with the Issuable Facts •which constituted the Equity of the Eill, and which the plaintiff must prove to obtain the Relief Prayed for; and the defendant there upon Rejoined with New Matter of Defense or Excuse along with his Answer. There after, the plaintiff filed a Replication as a mere Matter of Form to place the Answer in Issue. The Bill in Equity therefore consisted of three parts, the Narrative, which con tained a Statement of the Plaintiff’s Cas e for Relief; the Charge, which anticipated and attempted to refute the Defenses of the de fendant; and the Interrogative, which was to extract from him Admissions Under Oath in his Answer. It will be observed, therefore, that the Bill and Answer were generally framed so as to include the evidence by which each Party sought to sustain his position or to defeat that of his Adversary, as well as the legal arguments and conclusions, which properly should have been presented in the Briefs of Counsel. 5 ° On this very point of the theory of Law and Evidence, Common - Law Pleading and Procedure was vastly superior to the Civil Law and to the Procedure in Equity. How ever clearly substantive obligations and rights may be defined in any System of Law, there ca n be no security or freedom for the individual when judicially investigated, if competent evidence is rejected and incom petent evidence is admitted. Under the Com mon - Law System of reducing controversies to a single Issue of Fact, the Court could Rule acc urately upon Offers of Evidence, ad mitting that which was proper, and rejecting that which was improper, whereas, in Equity, which adopted the Civil Law System of Pleadings, permitting loose, detailed State ments of Both Law and Fact, as well as Con clusi ons, the Issue in dispute was placed in such doubt that the Scope of the Evidence was so broadened as frequently to permit the introduction of matter wholly foreign to the real controversy. Common Law Pleading, which was designed to frame a certain Issue o f Fact for Trial by twelve men, avoided this pitfall by indicating the character of and the limitations upon the evidence to be admitted. Relation to Code Pleading THE relationship between the Common Law and Code Systems as to the Structure of Pleadings h as been largely obscured on the one hand by the Procedural Reformers who, as an incident of their objectives, have played SC. Pomeroy, Code Remedies; Remedies and Reme dial Eights by the Civil Action, c.

I down the Advantages of Adjective Common Law and played up the alleged Superior Qual ities of Code Procedure; and on the other, by the members of the Teaching Profession, who have not had the ability, or who have not taken the time and patience required to understand and appreciate Pleading at Com mon Law. But speaking of the point of rela tionship, it is clear that there are few Rule s Regulating the Substance of Pleading under Modern Codes and Practice Acts which have not been directly borrowed from the Com mon Law, or framed by analogy in the appli -"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Page 36 of 735 cation of the same principle. 57 In fact, the Century following the Adoption of the Cod e of Procedure of New York in 1848,~ has been one in which the Common - Law Rules have been read back into the apparently clear and simple provisions of the Reformed Pro cedure, the unadulterated truth being that such provisions had no legal content except a s expounded against the appropriate Com mon Law Procedural Background. Code Pleading is not, as many have assumed, a System having no relation to existing law. Common - Law Pleading has not been abol ished; it still survives as the basis of all legal investi gation; it is in fact the direct Lineal Ancestor or Parent of Code Pleading, which literally springs from its Join. At best the Codification of Pleading is only partial, leav ing wide gaps in the System of Remedial Law to be filled in by Common - Law Pleadin g, ~t See 1 Standard Encyclopedia of Procedure, In troduction, ~ 11 (Los Angeles and Chicago, 1911). See, also, Solomon v. Vinson, 31 Minn, 205, 17 NW. 340 (1883); Dunnel, Minnesota Pleading. c. I, § 9 (1st ed. Minneapolis 1899). Rules of the Common - Law Pleading, as to Materiality, Certainty, Prolixity, and Obscurity, are rules of logic not abolished by the North Carolina Code. Crump v. Mims, 64 NC. 707, 771 (1870). The rules of pleading at Common Law have not been abro gated by th e Code of Civil Procedure. The essen tial principles still remain. Henry mv. Co. v. Semonian, 40 Cob. 269, 90 P. 682 (1907); Hughes, Procedure, Its Theory and Practice 488 (Chicago 1905). with its actual provisions interpretable only against the Older System. It becomes clear, therefore, that one can only come to full ap prehension of Code Pleading through the study of Common - Law Pleading. To illustrate this point, let us take the Common Code provision that the Complaint must state fac ts in “plain and concise” lan guage. 5 ° To one not trained in the Common Law this means a statement of “facts,” as Charles O’Connor, the distinguished New York Lawyer and Pleader, observed, “just as any old woman, in trouble for the first time, would narrat e her grievances,~’SC and whipped into some semblance of order by use of a Form Book; to one trained in the Common Law, it would mean that the plaintiff, in or der to state a Cause of Action, or the defend - ant, in order to state a Defense, should state the Ultimate Facts, and not the Evidence of Facts and not Conclusions of Law, as pointed out in the leading New York case of Allen v. Patterson. 6 ’ Bliss, in his famous work on Code Plead ing,° 2 stated Rules covering presumptions of Fact, Matters Judicially No ticed, Anticipat ing Defenses, and Pleading Evidence, Con clusions of Law, or Immaterial or Irrele vant Matters. But in each instance the source of such Rule under the Code is Common - Law Pleading; each Rule is in ef fect merely a restatement, in slightly d iffer ent phraseology, of the Rule as developed at Common Law. So, likewise, as to the Rules governing such matters as Duplicity, Cer tainty, Consistency, Directness, Argumenta tiveness, Allegations by way of Recital, and Alternative or Hypothetical Pleadi ng.

Sec. 5 RELATION OF PLEADING TO OTHER SYSTEMS 23 fact, express statutory provisions aside, it may be said that if a Lawyer, in a Complaint under the Code, frames his Allegations of Fact in a manner to meet with the require ments of Stating a Cause of Action or De fense at Common Law, he need have no fear of being thrown out of Court on Demurrer because of some Formal or Substantive De fect in his Pleadings. 63 Indeed, the prophetic words of Professor Thomas M. Cooley seem as true today as when originaijy written, when, in referring to the relation of the N ew to the Older System, he declared: “The works of Common Law Pleading have not been superseded by the New Codes which have been introduced. . . . A - careful study of these works is the very best preparation for the Pleader, as well where a Code is in for ce as where the old Common - Law Forms are still adhered to. Any expec tation which may have existed that the Code was to banish technicality, and substitute such simplicity that any man of common un ~erstanding was to be competent,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Page 37 of 735 without le gal training, to present his case in due Form - of Law, has not been realized. After a trial of the Code System for many years, its friends must confess that there is something more than Form in the Old System of Plead ing, and that the Lawyer who has learned to state hi s case in a logical manner after the Rules laid down by Stephen and Gould, is better prepared to draw a Pleading that will stand the test on Demurrer than the man who, without that training, undertakes to tell his story to the Court as he might tell it to a neighbor, but who, never having accustomed himself to a strict and logical presentation of the precise Facts which constitute the Le gal Cause of Action or the Legal Defense, is in danger of stating so much or so little, or - of presenting the Facts so in accurately, as to leave his rights in doubt on his own showing. Let the Common - Law Rules be mastered, and the work under the Codes will prove easy and simple, and it will speedily be seen that no time has been lost or labor wasted, in coming to the New Pra ctice by the Old Road.” 04 Relation to the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure TOWARD the close of the Nineteenth Cen tury, the American Bar Association conclud ed that Legislative Control of Practice was highly inefficient and that the Federal Con formi ty Act had produced no Real Conformi ty between State and Federal Practice. In this situation the Association placed its influ ence behind a bill in Congress which provid ed for turning the Federal Rule - Making Pow er over to the Supreme Court of the United States. After much agitation and much backing and filling, by the Act of June 19, i934,~ Congress gave the Supreme Court power “to prescribe, by General Rules, for the District Courts of the United States and for the Courts of the District of Columbia, th e Forms of Process, Writs, Pleadings, and Motions, and the Practice and Procedure in Civil Actions at Law.”° 6 The Rules as formu Jated under this Act did not modify in any way the substantive rights of litigants. The Act further provided that the Court mig ht “unite the General Rules prescribed by it for Cases in Equity with those in Actions at Law so as to secure One Form of Civil Action and Procedure for both.” 67 The right of Trial by Jury as at Common Law and decl?.red by the Seventh Amendment to the Con stitution was preserved. From the nature and character of the pro visions of the Act of 1934, and the Rules of Civil Procedure as promulgated thereunder by the Supreme Court in 1938, it is clear that 04.

There are, however, two thief differences. First, under the New System in the Federal Courts and as adopted in Several States, the control o f Pleading and Practice by Rule of Court gives a flexibility in the application of the Procedural Law and in its adaptation to any need for change growing out of new or un foreseen conditions, as opposed to the Older System of Code Pleading, which more or less placed procedure in a legislative strait - jacket, leaving little room for development to meet changing social conditions. Second, under the Codes, attempts to simplify and reduce the number of provisions regulating Pleading did not meet with success. F or example, the New York Civil Practice Act contained some 1578 Sections, Supplemented by 301 Rules of Civil Practice. In 1938, when a compari son was made between the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the New York Code, it appeared that it took onl y 86 Federal Rules to cover substantially the area occupied by 1100 of the 1578 sections of the Civil Prac tice Act and 133 of the 301 New York Rules of Civil Practice. And finally, it may be add ed that the spirit and tendency of the New System of Procedu re as represented by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and as reg ulated by the Judges, is"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Page 38 of 735 in the direction of the Common Law, as is evidenced, to give but a single example, by the provision that all Ac tions must be instituted through a Clerk of a Cou rt and by Authority of a Court, as at Common Law, as opposed to the Code Meth od of Commencing an Action by an Individ ual or an Attorney serving a Summons and Complaint upon the defendant. TIlE STATUS OF COMMON - LAW PLEAD ING UNDER TIlE CODES Acts and Fed eral Rules of Civil Procedure. But even after a Century of Development un der the Codes we still find that Common - Law Pleading survives in fact or in theory. On the basis of the degree of Common - Law Pleading which still prevails, the states fall into five groups: The Common - Law States; The Quasi Common - Law States; The Code States; The Rules of Court States; Civil Law States, IN the early part of the Nineteenth Cen tury the influence of Bentham began to be felt in America. By the New York Constitu tion of 1846, the Court of Chancery was abol ished,~ and a New Court having General Ju - risdiction over Law and Equity was created and the Legislature was directed to provide for the appointment of Three Commissioners “to revise, reform, simplify, and abrid ge” the Practice and Pleadings of the Courts of Record of the State.’ 9 In response to this di rection, in the following year the State Legis lature instructed the Commissioners “to pro vide for the abolition of the present Forms of Actions and Pleadings in cases at Com mon Law; for a Uniform Course of Proceed ing in all Cases whether of Legal or Equita ble Cognizance, and for the abandonment of all Latin and other foreign tongues, so far as the same shall by them be deemed prac ticable, and of any Form and Proceeding not necessary to ascertain or preserve the Rights of the Parties.” ~0 Under the directing genius of David Dudley Field, the Commission for mulated and reported a Code which was passed on April 12, 1848, and became opera tive on July 1, 1848, as the Code of Proce dure,~ 1 which has served as the source of most of our Modern Procedural Reform. The greatest single achievement of the Code, ac cording to Professor Pomeroy, was the sub - 68. Art xiv, § S. 6L Art. vi, 24. fl - N.Y.Laws 1847, e. 50, § 5. 71. N.Y.Laws 1848, C. 370. 6.

The Code also provided the Plead ings should state the Facts in plain and con cise language,’ 3 and that the more liberal provisions of Equity Procedure should gov ern Joinder of Parties, and provided for the rendition of Judgments against one or more P arties according to the particular interest of the Parties involved. Within a quarter of a century after the adoption of the New York Code of Procedure in 1848, the Code was adopted in twenty - four States, and, according to Clark,” some Form of Code Proced ure was, in 1947, then in force in twenty - nine states, two territories, the Dis trict of Columbia, and in the Federal Courts. So, even at this late date, it still remains true that the Movement for Reform, which took definite shape In 1848, has been only"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Page 39 of 735 p artial ly effective. Prior to the adoption of the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938, the States were roughly lined up in Four Groups, being classified as Common Law, Quasi.Common - Law, Code and Civil Law States. After 1938, there may be added ano ther Group, the Rules of Court States. Perhaps a brief word concerning each type of Jurisdiction may be helpful. i’he Common - Law States BY the phrase “Common - Law States,” is meant those States in which the Pleading is 19.

Carried into New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, Rule 3014 (1968). ‘71 - Ilandbook of the Law of cod e Pleading, c. I, 5 5, 25 (2d ed., St. Paul, 1947). primarily according to the Common - Law Rules, as Unwritten Law or in the Form of Statutory Enactment of the Common Law. Characteristic of the Procedure of the States which fall into this Group is the retention of the Forms of Actions and the Rules of Com mon - Law Pleading under a Court System that still calls for Separate Actions at Law and Suits in Equity. Even so, the Practice in these Separate Courts has from time to time been modified by Loca l Practice Acts. The Quasi Common - Law States IN these States the Formal Distinction be tween Law and Equity has been continued at least in theory, although in practice it has been weakened by Statutes abolishing the distinctions between Trespass and Trespass on the Case, or combining the Forms of Ac tions in the two divisions of Tort arid Co n tract. Usually in Jurisdictions of tins char acter Equitable Defenses are permitted in Law Actions. The Code States IN the Code States, originally largely pat terned ‘after the New York Code of Proce dure, the Systems of Pleading and Practice are Statut ory, but based on a combination of the better features of the Common - Law and Equity Procedural Systems. The same Rules apply to both Law and Equity Cases. But it should be remembered that there is a far greater similarity in the essential principles of Ple ading at Common Law, in Equity, and under the Reformed Code of Procedure than is generally realized. The Essential Ele ments of Causes of Action which must be Pleaded are not changed by the Codes. And the Rules as to the manner of making Alle gations of th e respective contentions of the Parties still have much in common. Rules of Court States THESE states are distinguished front the Code States, whose Pleading and Practice is generaily, if not entirely, Re~u1ated by the Legislature, in that their Procedure is Reg 26 BASIS OF MODERN REMEDIAL LAW Ch. I ulated by Rules of Court, usually framed by or under the authority of the Court of High est Jurisdiction - . --- the Supreme Court. The advantage of Regulating Procedure by Rule of Court as opposed to Legislative Enactment is that of greater flexibility in making chang es as the social need therefor arises, without the necessity of each time referring the mat ter to a Legislative Body, which may be dila tory in taking action, and is oftentimes influ enced by political considerations. Since the promulgation of the New Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a number of states have adopted the substance of the New Rules in revising their procedure. Civil Law States In this group the Syste ms of Pleading were originally based upon the Civil as opposed to the Common Law. Louisiana is a remaining State which began with a Civil Law back ground, from which it has never fully es caped."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Page 40 of 735 Conclusion ASIDE from the fact that after the lapse of over a Century, almost a third of the Several States of the United States were yet to accept the Reform represented by the adoption of a Code of Civil Procedure, how have the codes been received? The object was to blend Law and Equity into a Uniform Mode of Pro ce dure. This was to be accomplished by aboli tion of the Forms of Action and the Distinc tion between Law and Equity. A single Form of Action in the nature of an Action on the Case was to be substituted in place of the Common - Law Forms of Actions and S uits in Equity. In some Codes there were also provisions liberalizing the law controlling Joinder of Parties and Joinder of Causes of Action, but unfortunately many of the early Codes omitted the latter type of provision. In some States, notably New York, the Re forms under the Code of Procedure, met with a cold reception. 75 Thus in Reubens v. Joel,’° Selden, ~., in referring to the possibility of abolishing the distinctions between Law and Equity, declared: “By what process can these two Modes of Relief b e made indenti cal? It is possible to abolish one or the oth er, or both, but it certainly is not possible to abolish the distinction between them. Another leading distinction between Com mon - Law Actions and Suits in Equity con sists in their different Mod es of Trial. The former are to be tried by a Jury, the latter by the Court. Can the Legislature abolish this distinction? They might, but for the restraints of the Constitution, abolish either kind of Trial, or reclassify the classes to which they apply; b ut they cannot make Trial by Jury and Trial by the Court the same thing.” r~ What such an attitude has meant in practi cal terms is that a large part of the Century following the adoption of the First Codes has been spent by the Judges in reading back into the Code, provision by provision, the Rules of the Common Law. According to Clark, 75 the objections of the Courts which have taken an unfriendly atti Ta chief Justice Winslow of Wisconsin, said: “The cold, not to say inhuman, treatment which the in fant c ode received from the New York Judges Is matter of history. They had been bred under the Common - Law Rules of Pleading and taught to re gard that System as the perfection of logic, and they viewed with suspicion a system which was heralded as so simple that every man would be able to draw his own Pleadings. They proceeded by construction to import into the Code Rules and dis tinctions from the Common - Law System to such an extent that in a few years they had practically so changed it that it could hardly be r ecognized by its creators.” MeArthur v.

(2) Inherent differences as to Jurisdic tion and Venue, referring to the fact that Certain Actions must be brought in Certain Courts or at Certain Places. (3) Inherent differences as to the appli cation of Certain Statutes, such as Statutes of Limitations which were drawn along the lines of the old Procedural Divisions. (4) Inherent differences in Manner or Amount of Relief to be granted, referring to the Specific Relief of Equity as distinguished from the Money Damages ordinarily given at Law; or to a possible Variance in the Amount of Money Dam ages recoverable, de pending on the Form of Action chosen; or to Particular Remedies granted only in Certain Forms of Actions, such as Execution on the defendant’s body.

Ail these problems have, with a more liber al point of view on the part of the Judges, been satisfactorily solved in other C ode States, according to Judge Clark, and it was his belief that in time the Courts in New York would come around to the same view. But the very existence of the objections enu merated by Judge Clark ninety - nine years after the adoption of the New York Cod e of Procedure in 1848, plus the fact that nu merous States are still without the Circle of Reform, is some slight indication of the tenacity of the Common Law. And when you add to this the fact that the great bulk of the decisions under the Codes have nec essarily been made against the back ground of the Common Law, it becomes clear why many distinguished Judges cling to the thesis that the inherent and fundamental dif ference between Actions at Law and Suits in Equity cannot be ignored — a view which has fou nd the support, at least, of one dis tinguished teacher, 79 who stated, in referring to the Abolition of the Forms, that they “are not archaic, accidental, artificial or arbitra ry, but in the nature of things reasonable, if not indeed in their essence nece ssary.” ~° MODERN PROCEDURE UNDER CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES OF COURT — MERELY ANOTHER STEP IN THE EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMON LAW 7. Viewed in its proper Historical Perspec tive, any unbiased and well - informed Student of Legal History, Gene rally, and of Legal Pro cedure, Specifically, must observe that each new advance in our System of Procedure was and is but another Evolutionary Step in the Development of the Common Law, and must acknowledge the fact that Common - Law Plead ing, after the pa ssage of some Seven or Eight Centuries, still survives as the basis of our Modern Legal Procedural Systems as they ex ist in both the State and Federal Courts. HAVE the developments which have taken place since 1848, under the various Codes of Civil Procedure, and the Practice Acts of the Several States, together with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, been Revolutionary in Character, wiping out the Ancient Land marks of the Common Law and the pro cedural experience of the Anglo - Saxon race, extending over a period of over eight hundred years, or rather, have they been merely grad ual steps in the Evolutionary Development of Common - Law Pleading and Practice?

It was during this period that the Ancient Proprie tary and Possessory Real Actions developed in great number. Alter the Provisions o Oxford in 1258, the power of the Clerks in Chancery was re stricted, the Real and Mixed Actions beca me so highly technical, difficult to manage and lengthy in process, that they became inflex ible and in consequence the Common Law lost some of its inherent power of expansion. During this period of inflexibility, an effort to restore the Authority of the Clerks in Chancery was made so that they might again Create New Rights by Issuing New Writs under Chapter 24 of the Statute of Westmin ster II (1285). But the effort was too little and came too late, so that the Residuary Power of the King’s Council, operating through Chancery, was invoked to supple ment the Common Law, not necessarily be - cause of the Defects in the Common Law, but rather for reasons of State Policy. As a result of the Statute perhaps, but more as a result of t he growing social, eco nomic and mercantile needs of England, the Modern Personal Common - Law Actions, which to some extent ran parallel to the An cient"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Page 42 of 735 Proprietary and Possessory Actions, and which were gradually emerging into greater prominence with the d ecline of these actions, were substituted in lieu of the old Real Actions which had predominated dur ing the early Developmental Period of the Common Law. In the course of time, these Modem Forms of Action, latest in point of growth, in the Third State of Development, were abolished in favor of a Single, Form less, Form of Action, under which remedies could be provided for the violation of pri - vate rights of most any character. With this in mind, let us swiftly glance back over the territory covered, an d with al most a thousand years perspective in mind, view the Present Status of Common - Law Pleading and Practice as it stands in the light of Modem Reforms. From the Reign of Edward I (1272 - 4307) to 1848, a Period of five hundred and seven ty - six years el apsed, during which Period, in both England and the United States, Legal Procedure was governed by the Common Law. When, in England, the Modern Com mon - Law Actions were substituted in the place of the Old Real Actions, as is later observed, 8 ’ it was assume d that such an oc currence was merely a Normal Evolutionary Development of the Common Law, based up on the change in the English social structure from One of a Feudal to One of a Commer cial or Industrial Character. This change be came official or was Proc edurally recognized by the Real Property Limitations Act of 1833,~~ which abolished the Real and Mixed Actions. When, therefore, in 1848, the New York Code of Procedure attempted to obliterate the distinctions between Law and Equity, to abolish the Common - Law Actions and to sub stitute in lieu thereof the Modem Single Formless Form of Action, the World was witnessing, not a Revolutionary Reform which swept the Common - Law System from its Ancient Moorings, but merely a Third Step in the Evolutionary Developm ent of Common - Law Procedure, like that which took place in the Roman System. Between 1848 and 1947, according to Clark, 83 only twenty - eight out of the forty - eight States followed New York in establish ing Code Systems of Procedure. And in those States whi ch did follow New York’s ex ample, the intervening one hundred years have been spent largely in reading back into Si.

It has always seemed that this was to put the cart before the hone, that no understandable effort to define what is meant by the phrase “Forms of Action” could be made except as against a somewhat detailed survey of the History of the Com mon - Law Forms of Action, both Ancient and Modern. To present a definition to the stu dent at a time when he has no apperceptive background or conception of how the Forms of Action developed, woul d appear to be an almost fruitless effort. In any event, it is respectfully submitted that the viewpoint of one who is seeking an understanding of the Forms of Action should be one of realization that the “Common - Law Scheme of Actions was not framed; it gr ew.” ~ ORIGIN OF THE COMMON - LAW FORMS OF ACTION & The Common - Law Forms of Action had their Origin In the Action and Inter - action which took place between the Chancellor and the Three Royal Courts, King’s Bench, Ex chequer and Ctmmon Pleas, whereby individual litigants applied to the Chancery for Original Writs authorizing one of the three Courts to try a Specific ActIon. The Multiplication of this Process first produced the Ancient Real, Mixed and Personal Common - Law Action s, which later were superseded by the Modern Common - Law Actions. HOW, then, did the Formulary System of the Common Law develop the Ancient and Modem Common - Law Forms of Action? And why is a knowledge of what was meant by the phrase “Forms of Action” essen tial to one who seeks to understand the Law? comes at a time when the beginning student is not qualified to fully comprehend its meaning.

IV, Classification of Actions In the Common - Law Sys tem, 37 (Northport, 1906). The answer to these inquiries can only be discovered and understood against the back ground of the Norman Conquest and the statesmanship of William the Conqueror, who operating through the King’s Council or Curia Regis, the King’s writ, the King’s Inquest and the doctrine of the King’s peace, did three things which left an indelible imprint upon English Legal History, In the first place, he organized the System of Feudal Tenure under which, in lega l theory at least, land was held in some form under the King, which explained why the King’s Courts were always keenly inter ested in any litigation, public or private, which affected land. In the second place, he issued in 1072 what is now known as the Or dinance of William the Conqueror, 4 which separated the Ecclesiastical and Common - Law Courts. This development not only ex ercised a profound influence upon the Pro cedural and Substantive Law of Descent and Distribution, Wills and Testaments and Pro bate a nd Administration, but by reason of the fact that it left Jurisdiction over Free hold Estates in the Common - Law Courts, it was largely responsible for the subsequent necessity of classifying the Common - Law Actions as Real, Mixed and Personal. In the third place, he established Law and Order through the creation of a Centralized Sys tem of justice, as an incident of which the Common - Law Forms of Action were devel oped. The agencies by or through which these things were done were, in the beginning, the King’ s private property, and they were not at first National Institutions, nor were they a part of the Regular Machinery of Admin istration.

Perceiving this condition William, in the process of political reorganization of the whole country, began creating a System of Royal, Superior Courts, to which those not satisfied with the Local Courts, might repair. And it was through the operation of these New Courts under William the Con queror [1066 — 1087], Henry I [1100 — 1135], Henry’s grandson, Henry It 1154 — 1189], and Edward I [1272 — 1307], that the Centralization of Justice was achievedA The Courts in Which, the Forms of Action Developed An action could be instituted in each of the Three Superior Royal Courts, King’s Bench, Exchequer, and Common Pleas, each presided over by four Judges. Jurisdiction was distributed as follows; The Court of King’s Bench exercised control over Crimes, Torts Akin to Crimes, and Other Business Pertai ning to the Crown, Matters of Revenue Excepted; the Court of Exchequer handled cases relating to taxation and Revenue; while the Court of Common Pleas dealt with Ordinary Civil Suits between subject and subject, known as communia placita.

King’s Bench, by resort to a Fictitious Alle gation of Trespass wider which control of the defendant could be secured by an arrest, expanded its Jurisdiction at the expense of the other Two Courts in a manner so as to include all Personal Actions. By a similar process of usurpation the Court of Excheq uer also came to exercise Jurisdiction over Personal actions, but the Jurisdiction of nei ther Court extended to the cognizance of Real and Mixed Actions. In the meantime the Court of Common Pleas continued to ex ercise its Original Jurisdiction, which includ ed the authority to entertain All Actions be tween the subjects of the King, Real , Mixed, or Personal, such as the Ancient Proprietary Writs of Right, the Possessory Assizes, Writs of Entry and Writs of Entry and Forcible Detainer, or such Modern Actions as Ac count, Covenant, Debt and Detinue, then in existence, and in time, over thos e Personal Actions of later vintage, In King’s Bench and Common Pleas an Action could be commenced either by an Original Writ or by Bill; in Exchequer, by Bill only. The Former Method of Commenc ing an Action, according to Stephen, “is the regular and ancient one, and the latter is in the nature of an exception to it. The pro ceeding by Original Writ consequently claims first notice.” ~ The Original Writ (I) The Historical Rack graund. — When the Conqueror first took over in England, in the p rocess of establishing Law and Order, he followed the Norman system of having his Secretary, the Chancellor, write out and dis patch various Administrative Orders concern ed with the execution of the business of the Crown.

When, therefore, in pursuance of the Con queror’s announced policy of non - interfer ence with the Local Courts, an effort was m ade to aid the Administration of Justice by creating a System of Royal Courts to which Litigants, who Failed to Secure Jus - tice in the Local Courts, might repair, it was only normal and natural that the exist ing System of Administrative Controls should be applied to the conduct of the King’s business in the Courts. It is not surprising to find, therefore, that as each of the Su perior Common Law Courts split off from the Curia Regis or King’s Council, its activi ties were strictly limited to only those cas es which were delegated to it by means of an Administrative Order, which, when applied to Judicial Affairs, became a Judicial Ad ministrative Order, now familiarly known as an Original Writ (breve originale). Under Henry It (1154 — 1189), the use of such Wri ts, which had been occasional and extraordi nary, perhaps a royal favor, became usual and regular.

But later, when it became necessary or desirable to expand the activi ties of the King’s Courts, all that needed to be done was to expand and develop New Forms of what were, in the beginning, mere ly thought of as new routine s in the Process of Judicial Administration. In Glanvill’s ‘.

In Bracton’s day [1245 — 1267] however, the period of growth was definitely under way, and the Procedural Mechanism by which this was to be rcalized was to be through th e Invention of New Forms of Actions, to be, as he suggested, as numerous as there were Causes of Actions, under which the King was to Administer a System of Law as broad in its scope and variety as the Roman Law. The Common - Law theory that wherever there i s a wrong there is a Remedy 9 was in effect given expression even at this early date when it was declared that there ought to be a remedy for every wrong; if some new wrong be perpetrated then a New Writ may be invented to meet it. The Forms of Action, therefore, constitute a vivid illustration of the dependence of right upon remedy. The question of whether a man could bring this or that Action, such 8. During the latter part of the Reign of Henry II (1154 — 1189), the first systematic treatise of English Law appeared. The exact date of Its appearance is not known, but it is generally thought to have been somewhere around 1187 — 1180. And it has been at tributed to Banulf de Gianviil, Henry’s great Chief Justielar. According to 1 Pollock and Maitl and, flistory of English Law, Bk. I, c. v, 143 (Cambridge 1893), the author may have been his nephew, Hu bert Walter, who may have written under Glanvill’s direction.

There were at any given moment of develop ment — a development which stret ched over Centuries — only the same number of Rights of Action as there were Forms of Action. These Forms of Action, Ancient and Modern, persisted in actual use in English Procedure for Six Centuries, from the time of Henry TI [1154 — 1189] and Edward I [1272 — 1307], un til the Judicature Acts ‘° in the Nineteenth Century.

This book thus became an authoritative source I or the purpose of deter mining, at any given moment in English Legal His tory, what Forms of Writs were then available to litigants. A variation, how ever, from the transcript of the Form as it appeared in the Register, was not conclusive against the propriety of the Form, if it ap peared correct from other sufficient author it y adduced. Thus, the King’s Court was even then in the throes of developing a Formulary System through which it was ultimately destined to establish a Broad, General, National Juris diction and approximate the Common - Law ideal of affording a litigant a remedy for every wrong. This type of activity applied mostly to Civil Pleas or Common Pleas, whereas Pleas to the Crown, criminal for most part, depended upon a System of Pro cedure con trolled by the Local Authorities. These Civil Pleas originally were Pleas deal ing with the land, as under the Feudal Sys tem the crown was concerned with main taining strict control over the land, as a result of which the Common Law Regulating the Land wa s ultimately to be converted into the Common Law of the Land. While in general these disputes might also have been handled by the Local Courts, where the Feudal Court was either weak, partial or actually corrupt, a Writ might issue from the King, through t he Chancellor, ordering the Feudal Lord to do immediate Justice or appear in the King’s Court on a certain day and explain why not. In the beginning such intervention was largely administrative in character, and such threats, for the purpose of setting the Local Lord’s Judicial Ma chinery in motion, were not without both Anglo - Saxon and Anglo - Norman precedent. were wide differences. 2 Pol)ock and Maitland, History of English Law, Bk.

The purpose of the Register of Writs was to provide the C lerics in Chancery with an authoritative col lection of Forms for all the existing Writs. It also served as a guide to Lawyers as to what Writs were available in the Chancellor’s omce. Maitiand, in his article on The History of the Original Writs, 3 Ilarv. LRev. 97, 107 (1889), reprinted in 2 Select Essays in Anglo - American Legal History, e. 36, 549 (Boston 1908), declared that the Register grew and expanded over a period of some Three Centuries, during which time its 51cc constantly increased. Long after th e period of its greatest development had passed it appeared in print for the first time in what is known as A Collection of Rastell’s Entries, first published in 1596. 4 Reel - es, History of Eng lish Law, e. XXX, Henry VIII, 566 (Am. ed. by Fin lasen, Phila delphia 1880). For some Two Centuries thereafter this book and others based upon it were among the commonplace books used by the Prac ticing Lawyers. Such books took the Form of Com mentaries by Judges and text - writers upon the character and use of the Wri ts available in the Begister. These Writs, if the variations in each one were noted, reached Into the hundreds; if, how ever, we omit the variations, the number may be estimated at thirty or forty between which there 36 FORMS OF ACTION CIt 2 (III) The Creation of the First Origina’ Writ and Its Three Purpose& — However this may be, if for a moment we retrace our steps, there must have been a time, immediately after the First Superior Common - Law Court was differentiated from the King’s Council, when th e first litigant petitioned the Chan cellor for Relief, let us say, based upon a claim that his title or possession to certain property was in jeopardy. Where title or a proprietary interest was involved, the Rem edy required was some Form of the Writ of R ight, but where a mere possessory inter est was in question the Remedy consisted of a Possessory Writ, which later was fol - lowed by the Writ of Trespass (quare ckiuaum fregit) and the Writ of Ejeetment. Now, for the first time, the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Page 49 of 735 Chancellor was confronte d with the problem of just how he would delegate to the then single existing Court the required Authority of the King which was essential f or the Court to function or to hear the Complaint contained in the Petition to the Chancellor. At this point the Cha ncellor, faced with the Concrete prob lem of framing a Judicial Order for the first time, doubtless looked over the Forms of some of his Non - Judicial Administrative Or - ders, observed that they usually began with greetings from the King and were directed to the individual whose action was sought. Adopting such Nonjudicial Order as a pat tern, but phrasing it in Judicial Language, and directing it to the Sheriff of the County where the Cause of Action arose, or to the defendant, he thus cre ated the First Original Writ, the Beginning and Foundation of the Suit, the exact date of which is buried in the mists of history. After the first Original Writ of Trespass quare clausum Ire git (Trespass to Land), as referred to above, had been issued sev eral times to cover that Specific Factual Situa tion, it gradually acquired a Fixed Form and a Fixed Theory of Liability. If, however, the petitioner appeared in Chancery with a Complaint that his cattle had been taken and carried away, the First Writ did not fit the Factual Situation, hence the Chancellor or his Clerks had to Frame a New Writ to cover a Trespass to personal property. Look ing over the Form of the Writ of Trespass quare c7ausun’~ fregit, the Chancellor doubt less discovered that by changing the descrip tion of the property involved from realty to personally, he could accomplish the de sired end of authorizing the proper Court to try the case. Thus was created the Writ of Trespass to Personalty (Trespass tie bonis asportatis) - And so with an other slight vari ation in the language of the Two Preceding Writs, he was able to bring forth the Writ of Trespass for Assault and Battery. Pur suing the same thought, if the Complaint was that the defendant had failed to pay the plaintiff a sum certain d ue and owing, a Writ of Debt was framed; if the Complaint was that the defendant had breached the terms of a Sealed Contract, a Writ of Covenant was the plaintiff’s only remedy. And so on, until by a similar process, the whole gamut of human activity was i n a manner covered, and there developed in the Common Law a great multieiplicity of Types of Actions, as almost all types of injury, whether involving Breach of a Contract, Injury to Person or Injury to Property, occurred under slightly different combinati ons of Facts or Events, making with each variation a New Writ, the issuance of which created a New Right. An Original Writ, according to Blackstone, was a mandatory letter on parchment, issu ing out of Chancery, under the Great Seal, in the King’s name, d irected to the Sheriff of the County where the injury was alleged to have occurred, containing a Summary Statement of the Cause of Action, and re quiring the defendant to satisfy the claim, or upon the defendant’s failure to do so, then to Summon him to ap pear in the designated Superior Common - Law Court on the day named in the Writ, It was a kind of Judicial ~xecutive Order to show cause why he had not redressed the wrong complained of. In Sec. S ORIGIN OF FORMS OF ACTION 37 some cases it omitted the former alternative, and required the Sheriff simply to enforce an Appearance. Examples of the Form of such a Writ, in one of the Ancient Real Actions and in one of the Modern Personal Actions, the relationship of which will be developed later, appear below: FOR M OF TIlE WRIT OF PEAECIPE IN CAPITE’ 5 EDWARD THE FIRST, King of England, To the Sheriff of County, GREETING: COMMAND William Johnson that justly and without delay he render to Arthur Brown one messuage with the appurtenances in Trumpington which he claims to be his right and inheritance, and to hold of us in chief and whereof he complains that the afore said William Johnson unjustly deforceth him.

In other words, the Writs were not trans formed into Actions until, in pursuance of the authority granted therein, the defendant Appeared in Court. At that time the plain tiff, elaborating upon the Charge Stated in the Original Writ, filed his Declaration stat ing for the first time his Cause of Action, in the course of which he not only repeated the Charge in the Original Writ, but expand ed it into a full - fledged Statement of h is Cause of Action.

The Character of the Writ definitely defined and limited the Character of the Action. In short, except in the case of the Practice of Proceeding by Bill, no Action could be begun in any Superior Court without the express sanction of an Original Writ, the general effect of which was to confer Juris diction on the Specific Court in which it directed the defendant to Appear. This suing out of an Original Writ, the first step in the Commencement of an Action was, as we have seen, taken by the plaintiff, to whom it was available as a matter of course, upon the payment of a fee 14 to the King, t he size of the fee being in proportion to the amount demanded by way of Damages in the action. The cost of these fees, therefore, became a continuing and ever - increasing source of the King’s revenue, and constitutes one explana tion of the Crown’s unfailin g interest in the Administration of Justice.

In the beginning apparently there was no connection between the Original Writ and the Declaration.

And when the sum - mons was thus accomplished by virtue of the authority of the Writ, the actual service was made by the “good summoners” ref er red to in the Forms of the Old Wr its, and their knowledge of the Cause of Action neces sarily must have been obtained from the Original Writ. It has been suggested that the oldest Common Law Forms of Action are a direct lineal descendent of the (3cr - manic formulae of Pre - Norman and Nor ma n England; and that the Writ, which is of ancient origin, and the Count, which has a long record reaching back to the Anglo - Saxon time of"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Page 52 of 735 Alfred, were originally two separate forces operating independently of each other, but which, nevertheless, were gradu ally converging, until by the time of Glanvill (1178 — 1189) they were approaching a point of contact, which however, was not completed until the next, or Thirteenth Cen tury. Once this convergence was completed, it is clear that in time the Writ came to con trol both the Form of the Action as well as the Statement of the Cause of Action contained therein. (V) Necessity of Selecting the Correct Form of Writ. — When the plaintiff petitioned the Chancellor for an Original Writ, he was under great pressure to sele ct the right Writ for the facts of his case. He chose at his own persona! peril. If he selected a Form of Writ which did not fit his case, however just his grievance might be, he could not succeed. Thus, if he sued out a Writ of Debt and his Complaint was that he had been evicted from Blackacre, for which he should have sought a Writ of Ejeetment, the case would be dismissed, If he sued out a Writ of Replevin for a wrongful taking of Per sonal Property, he could not recover in Spe cial Assumpsit for Breach of a Contract. In each instance where he selected the Wrong Form of Writ, his only recourse would be to retrace his steps and start over, selecting a Writ appropriate to the character of his Complaint. Referring to this characteristic of the Common - Law For ms of Action, Pal - lock and Maitland compared the System to an Armory, declaring: “It contains every spe cies of medieval weapon from a two handed sword to the poinard. The man who has a quarrel with his neighbor comes hither to choose his weapon. The choic e is large; but he must remember that he will not be able to change weapons in the middle of the combat and also that every weapon has its proper use and may be put to none other. If he selects a sword, he must observe the rules of sword - play; he must not try to use his cross - bow as a mace.”” ‘9. 2 Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, Bk. II, c. IX, Procedure, ~ 1, 559 (Cambridge 1895). And Professor Hepburn, in his work, The Historical Development of Code Pleading c. Ii, § 46, 47 — 48 (Cincinnati, 1897), declared: “If a wrong Actiou was adopted, the Error was fatal to the whole proceed ing, however clearly the Facts of the Controversy might have been brought before the proper Court. The plaintiff may have served his Adversary in due time, and may have given as full Information as to the Material Facts of the Case as could be given in any other Action; he may hare proceeded openly and fairly in all matters; there may have been no question as to the substantial Justice of his claim; but all this woul d not avail if his Action was not technically the proper one. Be must pay the costs and go out of Court. If he chose, he could begin again, but under like conditions. At his peril he must select the appropriate formula. It was not enough that he stood with in the Temple of Justice, he must have entered through a particular door. Or, to change the ñgure, Chancery, the so - called offiebu, justitiac, was like an armory. To It every man who would contend with another in the Courts comes to choose his weapon. The choice is large. All the weapons of Juridical Warfare are here. But every weapon has Its proper use, and can be put to no other. Moreover, only one wcapon can be chosen at a time; and once chosen It cannot be exchanged for a different weapon In the progres s of the combat. It the ~ght Is to go on, It must be with 40 FORMS OF ACTION Cli. 2 (VI) The Power to Issue New Varieties of Original Writs. — The Chancellor was the King’s Secretary of State, and as such was long the most powerful Officer of the Gov ernment, having his hand in most of the business of the Kingdom. This resulted from the fact that he was the Keeper of the Great Seal which had to be impressed upon offi cial Documents, and from the fact that any Administrative Orders of the King were usu ally prepared under his personal supervision. And, in this connection, it should be remem bered that the Conquest introduced into Eng land the Norman principle that no individual or institution could act for the King or his Council unless authority to do s o had been delegated to him. When, therefore, the Su perior Common Law Courts were differenti ated from the King’s Council, and the prob lem arose of delegating to them the author ity to act in each case, naturally the Chan cellor and his Clerks, skilled i n drafting Ex ecutive Orders for the King, became respon sible for the preparation of Writs authorizing the Royal Courts to try Specific Cases which fell within their Jurisdiction. At first the Writs were probably awarded according to Abstract Conceptions of Justice and the needs of the case, but later only according to Precedent. And these Original Writs almost from the beginning differed from each other according to the nature of the Plaintiff’s Complaint and the ground of the Defendant’s Liability. Unles s the plaintiff’s Complaint such a weapon as was first chosen, and according to Its special rules. A sword being selected, the rules of sword - play must be strictly"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Page 53 of 735 followed. A erossbow may not be used as a mace. The issue of the combat must not be determined by mere brute force — not even by the brute force of indisputable facts arrayed before the Court. It is a contest of skill; success depends upon observing the formal rules of the combat,” In this connection, Blackstone referred to the Chan cery as “the oil icing fustitiae, the shop or mint of Justice, wherein all the King’s writs are framed.” Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of $lngland, ]3ook III, c. XIV, Of the Pursuit of Remedies by Action, 756 (Chase’s Am. ed., New York, 1517). fell within the scope of an Existing Form of Action, or unless the Chancellor saw fit to Issue a New Writ, the plaintiff could not maintain any Action at Law. For approximately a hundred years from the institution of the Writ System to the early part of the Thirteen th Century, the King’s general power to formulate and issue New Writs through the Chancellor seems to have been unquestioned. In consequence the Law, as developed in the King’s Courts, be tween 1154 — 1250, underwent a tremendous growth. The power to make Ne w Writs was a power to create New Rights, and hence New Law. Thus the Chancery became the principal instrument by which Justice was gradually Centralized in the Crown. It be came not only the “Shop of Justice,” but also the “Mother of Actions.” To the Chan cery must apply all those seeking relief, to which the language of some known Writ was ap plicable, or for some New Writ, framed on the analogy of those already in existence. Writs thus issued as a matter of routine were known as “writs of course.” And as new social needs arose and as the political status of the country permit ted, New Writs were hammered out on the anvil of Justice in the Shop of the Chancel lor, New Rights and New Laws were created, which taken together, came to be known as the Common Law , as opposed to the Custom ary Law enforced in the Local Courts, and which emerged during the latter part of the Thirteenth Century as a distinct System of National Law. The System, as thus devel oped, was the joint product of the Common - Law Courts. But it should be remembered that these Courts were powerless to act with out the authority of the King’s Writs, and that this New System was faced with a Struggle for Jurisdiction and Power stretch ing over several hundred years against pow erful rivals, chief a mong which were the Chancery and Ecclesiastical Courts, before it could achieve the position of first rank in the Sec. 8 ORIGIN OF FORMS OF ACTION 41 field of Anglo - American law. The credit for the creation of a Centralized Judicial System belongs therefore not only to the Common - Law Courts, but to the King and the Royal Officials, who made effective the Judgments of the Royal Judges, and who, by the King’s Writs, made Remedies available whic h were not ordinarily available under the Custom ary Law of the land. The Original Writ Sys tem was the fundamental basis of the New System of Centralized Justice. Toward the Middle of the Thirteenth Cen tury, the second great treatise in English law, Bra cton’s De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae, described by Pollock and Maitland as “the Crown and flower of English Medieval Jurisprudence,” 20 appeared. It served as a summary of the Writ System as it stood be twee n 1250 and 1258 and assured that the story of the development would be passed on to subsequent generations. Bracton took as his Model the Treatise of Mo of Bologna, the Great Civilian. 21 Maitland and Montague, in speaking of Bracton’s debt to Azo, said: “T hence he had obtained his idea of what a Law Book should be, and of how Law should be arranged and stated; thence also he bor rowed Maxims and some Concrete Rules; with these he could fill up the Gaps in our English System,” 22 The core of this Trea tise, however, was distinctly English and not Roman, and represented the Law as laid down by the Judgments of the King’s courts. If Bracton’s book be compared with that of Glanvilli, it will be seen that the Period be - SO. 1 PollocIc and 3faitland, History of E ngush Law, e.

It was during this Period, therefore, that the number of living Forms of Action reached its maximum. Shortly thereafter, the Real Actions revealed a tendency toward obsolescence, while the Common - Law power to create New Forms of Action was nearing its clo se. Under the influence of the Provisions of Oxford in 1258 only slight power of varying the Writs, An cient or Modern, was left in the Chancellor; beyond this, relief lay by way of Parliament and Statute, and with the death of Edward I [1307], the first g reat Epoch of English Leg islation ended. Thereafter, the greatest de velopment of the Forms of Action was to be found in the development of the Common Law Actions of Case, Ejectment, Trover, Special and General Assumpsit — a distin guished array — which ouste d many of the Older Actions and made heavy contribu tions to both Contract, Property and Tort Law. From one point of view this may be regarded as evidence of the vigor of the Forms of Action and as evidence of their ca pacity to forward the Development of Sub stantive Law; but from another viewpoint, it may be regarded as the “decline and fall of the Formulary System, for Writs are be ing made to do work for which they were £3. Bowman, Randbook of Elementary Law, e. IV, § 54, 162 (St. Paul 1929). 42 FORMS OF ACTION Ch. 2 not originally intended, and that work they can only do by means of Fiction.” 24 The great expansion of the Royal Author ity by use of the Writ System, as thus re corded by Bracton, did not depend entire ly upon the work of the Common - Law Courts. Thus, out of the Residuary Power which re mained in the King’s Council after the Com mon - Law Courts were differentiated there from, the Court of Chancery was created. The Ecclesiastical Courts, which assumed a sep arate existence after the Ordinance of LW1UI~ the Conqueror in 1072, governed matters of spiritual conduct, and certain as pects of the Law of Succession while much litigation was cared for in the Local Courts and in the Private Baronial Courts. Fewer Cour ts, less Jurisdictions, would appear to have been the demand of the day. Neverthe less, the Development of the Court of Chan cery steadily proceeded. Why? 25 fl. 2 Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, Bk. II, c. IX, Procedure, 562 (Cambridge 1895 ). ‘The typical pitfall which a Pleader might meet with in selecting a Form of Action is well illustrated by - one of David Dudley Field’s reminiscences concern ing the period immediately preceding the Enact ment of the New York Code of Procedure of 1848, when he said: “I came near losing a ease on a Pol icy of Insurance by declaring in Assurnpsft. When the Policy was produced at the Trial, the defend flat’s Counsel insisted that it had a Zeal and so the Actio n should have been Covenant. There was, in - deed, a mark on the paper as if it had been stamped with a Seal or something like it, but the impression was faint, and the Judge, ?oolthtg at U without his glasses, said he could see no seal, and denied the Motio n for Nonsuit.” Field, Law Reform in the United States and Its Influence Abroad, 25 Am.L. Rev. 515, 518 (1891). t5. With reference to the Development of Equity as an incident of the reluctance of the Clerks in Chan cery to grant New Writs, Blackstone, in speaking of Chapter 24 of the Statute of Westminster II, 13 Edw. I (1285), which authorized the Clerks to Is sue New Writs In Cases similar to but not quite Identical with Cases in which Writs were previously Issued, stated: “Which provision (with a little ac curacy in the Clerks of the Chancery, and a little liberality In the Judges, by extending rather than narrowing the remedial effects of the Writ) might bave effectually answered all the purposes of a The answer seems to be connected with the Power of the Chancellor to issue Original Writs. As long as this power was unrestrict ed and broad enough to encompass what we now describe as Equitable Relief, there was little reason for the development of the Eq uity Courts. But this condition was n ot des tined to continue. Among the Third Class of Writs set forth by Bigelow, there were a number which nev er became Writs of Course and which were of a character which in Modern Times would be regarded as Equitable. According to Big - elow, 2 ° these were Writs of Protection, being the forerunners of our Modern Writs of In junction, and of the protective process gen erally as exercised by Chancery in its Early Stages of Development. The fact that these Writs never became dc oursu, accounts in no small measu re, for the development of Ex clusive Jurisdiction Over"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Page 55 of 735 such Forms of Re medial Relief by Chancery. If these Writs had achieved the status of Writs of Course, they would have fallen outside the purview of the Provisions of Oxford in 1258, and hence the Jur isdiction of the Royal courts would have remained unlimited and unim paired as to this Type of Writ. The result might well have been to eliminate Equity or at least to prevent the vast expansion which thereafter took place. Or to put it in anoth er way, th e result of this development was to deprive the Common - Law courts of the power to compel obedience to their Specific Orders, that is, of coercing obedience by or ders in personam — a power, which we now know, as a result of research that has been done in the early cases, was exercised by the Superior Courts of the Norman Period.

S ORIGIN OF FORMS OF ACTION 43 Law was necessarily retarded at a time when it had not yet fully flowered, at a time when it had not fully emerged from its Primitive Stage, and its great qualities appeared as such only when viewed against the back ground of the earlier and existing situa tions, and not in the light of later developments. This untimely restriction upon the Power to Issue New Writs under which the Common Law had gone far in the direction of furnish ing England a Complete and Adequate Sys tem of National Law, resulted in the Com mon Law falling short of its full fruition. Several reasons for this unfortunate develop ment may retrospectively be assigned; they are: (A) Impairment of the Lards! Jurisdiction Over Their Private Courts — One of the Methods by which the Crown drew unto it self control over the Administration of Jus tice was by depriving the Barons of their Jurisdiction over disputes with their tenants. The theory was that the King intervened to assist a helpless tenant, or other litigant, as against a powerful landlord, but the net re sult was to give the King’s Court Jurisdic tion over the case. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that when the Barons re volted against King John in 1215, they “ex acted from him the first important conces sions as the begin ning of a long period of resistance to the absolute and centralized power of the English Kings.” 27 And they took advantage of the situation to make offi cial their resentment of the encroachment upon their Baronial Jurisdiction by placing a provision in M agna Carta, Section 34 of which declared: “The Writ which is called Praecipe for the future shall not be made out to anyone of any tenement whereby a freeman may lose his Court.” Such provision clearly indicates the opposition of the Bar - ons to the constan t and increasing infringe ment upon their Jurisdiction, although it re mains doubtful whether it had any perma nent effect in restricting the Chancery from issuing Writs, or the - King from continuing to impair the Jurisdiction of the Local as well as the Private Courts. (B) The Provisions of Oxford (1258). — The issue involving the impairment of the Jurisdictions of the Barons was again raised in 1258 at Oxford. At this time and place the power of devising New Writs and there by creating New Rights of Acti on — a power ful and dangerous weapon in unscrupulou~ hands — received a severe check. The Bar ons, headed by Simon de Montfort, forced up on Henry III [1216 — 1272] the Provisions of Oxford, under which an Oath was imposed upon the Chancellor that he would issu e no Writs “excepting Writs of Course without the Commandment of the King and of his Council who shall be present.” ~ This pro vision, more effective than Section 34 of Magna Carta in 1215, placed in Parliament and not the King, the broad authority to cre - ate New Rights by granting New Remedies, with only a fraction of his former power left to the King. But, the effect of the Provi sions was practically annulled some five years later by the decision of Louis IX, who was appointed as an arbitrator between He nry and the Barons, though the former power of the Chancellor does not seem to have been renewed. And, as so often hap pened in English History, Parliament made but scant use of this New Power. In conse — quence, the Provisions of Oxford soon be came inoper ative under the changing politi cal conditions, so that to all practical intents and purposes, the right to Legal Relief was 28.

(C) The Statute of Westminster ii (1285). — By this time, however, the Ancient Real Actions and certain of the later Common - Law Actions, such as Trespass , Debt, Detinue and Replevin, appear to have developed as a result of the action and interaction which took place over a long period of time between the Clerks in Chancery and the Common - Law Courts and Judges, without the aid of statutory en actments. Whi le these Actions met the needs of their day fairly well, and through them, litigants were able to secure a rough and ready sort of Justice, they, nevertheless, fell far short of the Common Law ideal of providing a Rem edy for every wrong. This was due in p art to Defects in the Procedural Law and in part to Defects in the Substantive Law. On the Procedural Side, the Action of Detinue had been rendered practically useless because subject to Wager of Law — a handicap from which it never fully recovered, even aft er Wager of Law was abolished; and the Ac tion of Debt was subject, in addition to Wa ger of Law, to the requirement of extreme particularity in setting out the various items of the demand sued on. On the Substantive Law Side, there were also wide Gaps in the Remedial Law in both the Contract and Tort Field. In the Contract Field, Covenant was still the only form of Contract known, unless a situation out of which a Common - Law du ty to pay a debt could be regarded as Con - tractual, and No Remedy had been deve loped br the Breach of a Parol Promise. In the Tort Field, while Trespass served as a fairly Adequate Remedy where the injury com plained of was accompanied by force, it took no cognizance of those injuries which were (1) nnaccompanied by force, such as in the mere detention of goods where there had been no unlawful taking; (2) accompanied by force, consequential and not immediate in its nature, such as an injury resulting from fa lling over a log, placed in the road at a time prior to the injury; (3) accompanied by force, and resulting in injury to property not then in possession of the owner, such as an injury to a reversionary interest in realty. These Defects, which we are now a ble to point out retrospectively, were not definitely recognized at that time. At this point, however, It should be re niernijered that the Writ of Trespass on the Case, which authorized the plaintiff to bring an action on the Particular Facts of his own case, in situations where none of the approv ed Writs in the Register fit, had already been recognized. 29 But before it had developed into a well - recognized and fully approved Writ, the power of devising New Writs and thereby creating New Rights of Action re ceived a severe check by the Provisions of Oxford. Nevertheless, the presence of the Defects outlined above, coupled with the commercial growth and development of the country, were, perhaps, an unconscious factor which led to the enactment in 1285 of t he Statute of Westminster 1I,~° which authorized the Clerks in Chancery to issue New Writs in all cases similar to but not quite identical with cases in which Writs had been previous ly issued, thus giving rise to the question 29.

Sec. S as to whether the Action of Trespass on the Case originated out of the Statute, or is to be more satisfactorily explained on some other theory. The issue thus presented has long been the subject of a learned controversy which has developed a considerable literature. The participants in this controversy, among whom are some of the most distinguished Anglo - American Le gal Historians, Scholars and Teachers, have developed Three Schools of Thought. These include: (1) Those who bel ieve that the Action of Trespass on the Case developed as a result of the impact of the Statute of Westminster II,~’ taking its very name from the word casu as used in the famous and familiar phrase “consimili casu,” which appeared in Chapter 24 of the Sta tute. This group, known as the “Modernists,” is represented by Ames, 32 Jenks ~‘ and Sutton. 34 (2) Those who think that the Statute of Westminster It ~ had nothing to do with the Origin of the Action on the Case.

This group, known as the “Traditionalist s,” includes Holdsworth 3 ° and Landon 4 ° (0) The Growing intervention of Ultan cery. — Perhaps the real responsibility for the Arrested Development of the Common Law should be laid at the door of Chancery. Clearly the Inventive genius of the Clerks in Chancer y had not come to an end as in that event there would have been no need f or Section 34 of Magna Carta in 1215 or the Provisions of Oxford in 1258. As a matter of policy the King’s Council evidently felt that there were certain Areas of Jurisdiction over which it desired to retain a closer su pervision, and the argument seized upon for such a course of action was that there were certain defects in the Common - Law Reme dial Scheme, as a result of which Meritorious Litigants were left Without Remedy at L aw, hence the intervention of Chancery became necessary. But such was not always the case, as where the captain of a ship came in to an English port, and being there but a few days, demanded payment of a debt due from an Englishman. Thus, the King, desirin g to advance the mercantile interests of the coun try, and in the face of the established fact that the plaintiff had an Adequate Remedy at Law in the Action of Debt, permitted the Chancellor to hail the defendant into Court, 38. 13 Edw. 1, c. 24 (1285), 1 Pickering’s Statutes at Large 196."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Page 58 of 7 35 30.

Mixed Actions partook, in some de gree, of both Real and Personal Actions, where in some Real Property was awarded, and also Personal damages for a Wrong s ustained, and hence they were not properly reducible to either of them. they were brought both for the Specific Recovery of Lands, Tenements, or Her editaments, and for Damages for injury sus tained in respect of such property.

And as these Actions grew in number and scope, as a re sult of the action and interaction which took place between the Chancery and the Three Superior Common - Law Courts, they were often di fferentiated by very slight shadings of meanings, and it was only natural that an effort should be made to classify the various Actions. And in connection with this effort, it should always be borne in mind that the term “classification” may and almost ine vi tably is bound to have different implications in Different Periods of a Nation’s Develop ment. Thus, if, in English Legal History, we go back as far as Glanvill and Bracton, we find that they regarded some Actions Per sonal which Blackstone, 43 writing a bout 1765, treated as Real or Mixed. But for general purposes, we may nevertheless now use as 43. Diackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of Eng land, Book III, C.

Sec. 10 ANCIENT REAL ACTIONS 47 our starting point the Classification which Blackstone published to the world with the appearance of the first edition of his Com mentaries on the Laws of England. He de clared: “With us in England the several Suits or Remedial Instruments of Justice, are from the subject of them distinguished into three kinds, Real, Mixed and Personal. 44 “Real Actions (or as they are called in the M irror, Feudal Actions), which concern Real Property only, are such whereby the plaintiff, here called the Demandant, claims title to have any lands or tenements, rents, com - mons, or other hereditaments, in fee - simple, fee - tail, or for term of life. By thes e Actions formerly all disputes concerning Real Es tates were decided; but they are now pretty generally laid aside in practice, on account of the great nicety required in their manage ment, and the inconvenient length of their process; a much more expedit ious method of trying titles being since introduced, by other Actions Personal and Mixed. “Mixed Actions are suits partaking of the nature of the other two, wherein some real property is demanded, and also personal damages for a wrong sustained. As for in stance an Action of Waste. “Personal Actions are such whereby a man claims a Debt, or Personal Duty, or Damages in lieu thereof; and, likewise, whereby a man claims a satisfaction in Damages for some injury done to his person or property. The former are s aid to be founded on Contracts, the latter upon Torts or Wrongs; and they are the same which the Civil Law calls ‘ac tiones in personam, quae adversus eum in tenduntur, qui ox contractu vel delicto obli gatus ost aliquid dare vol concedere’. Of the former nature are all actions upon Debt or Promises; of the latter all actions for Trespasses, Nuisances, Assaults, Defamatory Words, and the like. 44. The original arrangement of the three types of Actions reads Personal, Mixed and Real, which or~ de r has been changed for purposes of presenta “Under these three heads may every spe cies of remedy by Suit or Action in the Courts of Common Law be comprised.” ~ TILE ANCIENT REAL ACTIONS FIRST IN ORDER OF DEVELOPMENT 10. There were Two Divisions of the Real Actions — those founded on Seizin or Possession, and those founded on the Property or Right. JACKSON defines a Real Action as “one that is brought to recover the freehold in lands, tenements or hereditaments, claimed eit her in fee simple, fee tail, or for life, by one who is deforced, against him who is a ten ant thereof.” 4~ They were known as Real Ac tions because the Judgments rendered there in were in rem"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Page 60 of 735 and awarded seizin or posses sion. 47 In these Actions the Party bringing the Action was known as the Demandant, while the Party against whom it was brought was the Tenant. And the First Pleading on the part of the Demandant was called a Count. Over a Period of Several Centuries running as far as the reign of Elizabeth [1558~l6O3],~~ the existence of these Reme dies, available only in favor of owners of freehold estates, made possible the settle ment of all disputes concerning real estate on a reasonably satisfactory basis. These Writs to determine the rights of property and the rights of possession in a freehold, varied according to the title or seizin of the Demandant, and the circumstances of ouster or deforcenient; they were feudal in origin and were in number about sixty, the distinc tion between them being highly te chnical and refined, and the trial long and costly, all of which facts were factors in their ultimate 45.

Real Property Limitations Act, 3 & 4 Win. IV, a of property, the right of possession, and the 27, ~ so (1833). actual present possession. As the right of Sec. 10 ANCIENT REAL ACTIONS 49, property and the right of possession might be in different persons while the actual pos session was in a third person, actual posses sion was regarded as a right distinct from the right of property and the right of pos session. 50 If one having the Complete Title to land was dispossessed, he lost one of the constitu ent elements of his Title, that is, actual pos session. This left remaining in him the right of possession and the right o~ property. As to all other persons except the person ousted, the disseisor became the owner of the Com plete Title; as to the person ousted, he was the owner of the Complete Title, subject to be defeated by enforcement of the disseisee’s superior right of property or right of posses sion. If such rights were not enforced with in certain periods of time fixed by the Com mon Law or by Statute, the disseisor’s Title became indefeasible as to all failing to show a superior right of property or right of pos 50. “The treatment of Actual Possession as a Right, or as implying a right distinct from the right of pos sess ion, has been misleading. Actual possession is a Fact or Status. As a Fact it Is prima Jane Evi dence of the Right of possession, because It is the natural manifestation of that right As a Fact or Status it is protected by Law for reasons of public policy against displacement, except by Judicial Process at the instance of someone having a Supe rior Right to possess. Peaceable Possession there fore is not a Right, but it is a Fact or Status which implies the Right in the possessor to continue his possession until it is displaced by Judicial Process. This Right of Possession is provisional, and sub ject to determination at the suit of any one having an older and therefore Superior Right of Posses - zion. In imputing to the peaceable possessor a Right in the Fact of his Possession, nothing more could have been Intended than to recognize In him a Peculiar Right of Possession, which springs from and is implied from the Present Pact of Possession. This Eight o f Possession night co - exist with a Right of Possession In some one else springing from a Previous Fact or Status of peaceable possession. Thus we have two persons Invested with rights of possession. One founds his right on a present peace~ able possession, the other founds it on a previous peaceable possession, or a Right of property which resolves itself ultimately Into an older possession or seisin.” Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, c. IV, Ancient Real ActIons, 100, n. 1 (St. Paul, 1905). session. T he same rule applied in case of an abatement where upon the death of a per son seized of an inheritance a stranger ac quired possession of the freehold before ac tual entry of the heir or devisee; also in case of an intrusion where a stranger, after ter mi nation of a particular estate of freehold, acquired possession before entry of the re mainclerman or reversioner. The effect of a disscisin, abatement or intrusion was to convert the estate of the disseisee, heir, dew isee, remainderman, or reversioner, as the case might be, into rights of possession and rights of property. Such rights were de scendible, but neither devisable nor assign able. Conversely, the interest of the disseis or, abator, or intruder, was alienable, divisi ble and descendible, being an estate in pos session. These rights of property and rights of pos session were remediable under the Ancient Law by the Extra - Judicial Process of Self - Help, or by the Judicial Process represented in the Scheme of Real Actions. Upon dis seisin, abatement o r intrusion, the person ousted — the disseisee, heir, devisee, remain derman, or reversioner — was permitted to make a peaceable entry, making his Title again complete. If peaceable entry was not possible, his only course was to resort to le gal redress, as fo rce could not be used with out falling under penal restrictions. Entry by force was not only a punishable offense, but the former occupant could by a Writ of Forcible Entry immediately be restored to possession, irrespective of any right of pos session or right of property of the original disseisee. Failure"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Page 62 of 735 on the part of the dis seisee to make a peaceable entry in the life time of the disseissor, abator or intruder, re sulted in ending the right of peaceable entry without process. Extra - Judicial Entry was ended by the fact of a descent cast. There after the disseissor’s heir could rot be oust ed except by an Action asserting the dis seisee’s superior right of possession or of so FORMS OF ACTION Ch. 2 property. But the descent of incorporeal hereditaments ly ing in grant did not take away the right of entry. 5 ’ The disseisee, however, by making claim at any time be fore the death of the disseisor, might evade the effect of the descent east, and save his right of entry for a year and a day after such claim made. Thus, the continuance of the disseisor in possession after claim made was regarded as a new disseisin. By the Statute of 32 Henry VIII, c. 33, 5 Statutes at Large 48, ~154O], the Right of Entry was extended so that a descent from a disseisor could not hav e the effect of taking away the Right of Entry, except where the disseisor had peace able possession five years next after the dis seisin, The Statute was construed as not being applicable to a descent from the heir of a disseisor, or from his feoffee, so that such descents barred the Right of Extra - Ju dicial Entry, notwithstanding a want of five years’ possession. It may be added that in cases in which the wrongdoer had acquired possession lawfully and then unlawfully de tained it, the party entitled had n either a Possessory Action, nor Remedy by Self - Help; he could only invoke a Proprietary Action to establish his rights. For reasons of public policy, the Common Law protected a person in peaceable posses sion of land, irrespective of the method of acquisi tion. 52 Actual seisin or possession, however acquired and however wrongful, created a presumptive right of possession, or a species of property based on the fact of 51. Co.Litt. 28Th (London, 179t). 55. “It accomplished this In three ways: 1st, by re fusing to enforce in the Courts any one’s Claim to Possession wbicb was not Superior to the flight of the actual possessor; 24, by summarily restoring to the ousted possessor his possession, when it was forcibly taken from him, Irrespective of any Right of Possession, in the party who had interrupted the possession; 3d, by punishing any one who attempt ed to enforce his Rights of Possession, without Process of the Courta’ Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, c. IV, Ancient Real ActIons, 109 (St. Paul, 190 5). his possession~ In case of being dispossess ed, the disseisee could vindicate his right of possession by resort to some Possessory Pro ceeding, basing his action on his actual seis in and the wrongful act of the disseisor in ousting him. At hand were t he Possessory Remedies in the Form of the various Writs of Assize or a Writ of Entry, depending up on the character of his case. Also available was Self - Help if resorted to before descent cast, and if not barred by the Common Law or Statute. If such Remedy failed or was lost, he still might regain possession by some form of Possessory Action, provided he act ed within the period of time in force at the time the action was brought. In general, limitation of Possessory Actions was fixed at twenty years. If th e Possessory Action was not brought within the time limit, or if, when brought, it resulted in defeat, the disscisee night still resort to a Proprietary Action, if brought within the period of time limiting such actions, which was sixty years. In such acti ons the plaintiff alleged seisin or possession of a fee, and added that he claimed “as of right,” thus raising the Issue of ultimate dominion, or right of ownership, which either included or implied the superi or right of possession as incident to it or co nstituted the right itself. Generally, this dominion or ownership is referred to as something very different in its nature from the right of possession. It becomes appar ent, however, when ownership in land is re solved into its essential elements, that th e fundamental one is the right of possession. It would seem, therefore, that the right of property enforced in the Proprietary Actions is nothing more than an older and superior right of possession. 54 In its strictest sense property is the right to possess and use a determinate thing, in ~3. Ibid. 54’ 2 ?ollock and Maitland, History of English Law, c. IV, Ownership and Possession, 77, 78 (CambrIdge 1895). Sec. 10 ANCIENT REAL ACTIONS"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Page 63 of 735 5’ definitely in point of user, unlimitedly in point .of duration, and unrestricted in point of alienation or disposition. 5 ” In England there was probably no property in land which measured up to this ideal of absolute prop erty. But from Bracton on, the righ ts of proprietorship have been ascribed to the ten ant in demesne, notwithstanding the rights of seigniory remaining in the lord and ulti mately in the sovereign. The right of the tenant in fee has in point of fact been treated as property in the highest s ense, even though it falls short of the ideal of absolute proper ty. And the philosophy or logic of property rights has been done no violence by ascrib ing them without limitation to the rights of a tenant in English law, much less to a pur chaser in fee u nder the Laws of the Several States of the United States. As the foundation of the right of owner ship is the right of possession to which the other rights are primarily incidental, it fol lows that one cannot use or dispose of a thing which is in the adv erse possession of another. When the right to possession is once vindicated, these other rights are re stored along with the possession. Williams, the distinguished authority on English Prop erty Law, has stated that there is “no action in the Law of Engla nd by which property either in goods or land is alone decided,” ~ as distinguished from the right to possession either immediate or future. The explanation of this is found in the fact that the right of property in land or goods is only another name for th e right of possession, and the other rights incidental to it. Thus, in all of the Real Actions, whether Proprietary or Possessory, the Material Issue was the right of possession. As Pollock and Maitland so 5~. 2 Blackstone’s commentaries on the Laws of En g land, c. I, 207 — 215 {4th ed. by Chase, New York 1914). truly observed, “every Title to Land has its root in Seisin; the Title which has its root in the Oldest Seisin is the Best Title.” ~ The superior right of possession, being the older one, was called the right of property, but only in comparing it with the right of pos session, which came from subsequent adverse enjoyment, and which was to be protected by Law for reasons of public policy. If the technical distinction between Proprietary and Possessory actions had never developed, and if our English ancestors had only known Possessory Actions, it is extremely probable that the Scheme of Ancient Real Actions would have been better understood and en forced. We shall see later how this failure was instrumen tal in bringing about the aboll tion of the Real Actions. A form of the Writ of Right and a form of the Assize of Novel Disseisin appear below: FORM OF THE WRIT OF EIGHT GEORGE THE FOURTH, by the grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and fretand King, Defender of the Faith and so forth, To the sheriff of County, GREETING: COMMAND C.D., that justly and without delay he render unto AS. four messauges, four gardens, and four acres of land, with the appurtenances, in the parish of ______ i n the County of , which he claims to be his right and inheritance, and whereof he complains that the aforesaid C.D. un justly deforces him.

Forcible Entry and Detainer AT Common Law the Remedy for a Forci ble Entry or a Forcible Detaine r was not recognized as a Civil Action. When author ized by Statute, 58 it originated as an incident 53. See Statute of 5 RIch. II, c. 7, 2 Statutes at Large 240 (1381). to a criminal prosecution of a Party who had used superior force in making entry upon land. 5 ° The Remedy as thus developed took the form of a summary restitution of the land in question by the Justices of the °° or by Action of the Court of King’s Bench. This proceeding, under which the disseisee might be restored to his Jand, was early use d as a substitute for the more cumbersome and highly technical Real Actions, thus aiding in their gradual deterioration. 6 ’ According to Blackstone 62 a Forcible En - try consisted of violently taking possession of lands or tenements with force and arms and without authority of Law. And a Forci ble Detainer consisted of keeping possession of lands and tenements in the same lawless manner. Both offenses were not only against the person turned out or kept out of posses sion, but were wrongs against the King. A s enacted and construed these English Statutes on Forcible Entry and Detainer furnished a Popular Remedy for a period of five hundred years. In 1879, the Statute of 8 Hen. VT, c. 9, 3 Statutes at Large 121 (1429) was repealed except as to its crim inal pro visions. 63 And the Ancient English statutes regulating Forcible Entries and De tainers, in large measure, have been recog nized or reenacted in most American States, with such modifications as might be neces sary to meet local conditions, and as such have exerted an important influence on our Modern Procedure. 59.

The Defects in the Proceedings involved in the various R eal Actions and the abuses which grew up around them had originated in the Courts and for years had gone on uninterrupted by any at tempt at Parliamentary Reform. In the first quarter of the Nineteenth Century, as an incident of the general wave of Govern mental Reform which swept over England, a Movement for Procedural Law Reform got under way. It is therefore not surprising to find that in 1833, by the Real Property Limitations Act,” the Real and Mixed Actions, with few exceptions, were swept aside. The S tatute provided that some sixty actions, specifically named,° 5 should not be brought after December 31, 1834. 64. 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 27, § 36 (1833). 65. The Statute of 3 & 4 Wm.

As a widow claiming dower coul d not institute an Action of Ejectment until after her dower had been set out,°° the two Writs of Dower were temporarily preserved. In 1860, with the establishment of a New Statutory Form of Action to serve as a substitute, the Old Writs of Dower were abol ished by the Common Law Pro cedure Act. 67 Also abolished by the same act was the Writ of Quczre Impedit. TUE MODERN REAL ACTIONS 11. The Modern Real Actions included Ejectment, Trespass to Try Title, Writs of Entry, Disseisin, Dower and Partition, and Forcible Entry and Detainer. The Action of Ejectment WHEN it finally became clear that the so - called distinction between the Proprietary and Possessory Actions was largely illusory, that you could not Try Title without also trying possession, and that the se Actions were needlessly technical and very expensive, tium, writ of entry ear abatement, writ of entry quare ejecit infra terminum, or ad terminum qui praeteriit, or eauea matri,nonii praelocuti, writ of aid, besaiel, tresaicl, cosinage, or nuper obiit , writ of waste, writ of partition, writ of disceit, writ of quad ci deforceat, writ of covenant real, writ of warfl rantia chartae, writ of curia elaudenda, or writ per quae seri,itia, and ‘zo other action, real or mixed, (except a writ of right of dower, or writ of dower unde nihU habet, or a quare impedit, or an cject,nent,) and no plaint in the nature of any such writ or action (except a plaint for free bench or dower), shall be brought after the 81st day of De cember, 1884.”"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Page 66 of 735 06.

This move by the Common - Law Courts was hastened by the threat ened intervention of Chancery. And the change came about not by developing a New Remedy, but “by adapting the well known Process and Proceedings of Personal Actions to the Trial of Issues relating to ouster and disseisin from real estate.” °~ More specific ally, the Action of Ejectment was developed out of the Writs of Quare Ejecit In Ira Terininum and Dc Ejectione Firmae in favor of the owners of non - free hold estates. Through the use of the famous Fiction in Ejectment it ultima tely became available to the holders of freehold estates as well, without violating the Common - Law theory that it could be used only to protect the possession of non - freehold estates. The details of this development will be set forth fully in the Chapter o n the Action of Eject ment.°° The Action, as thus developed by the Com mon Law, was excepted from the sweeping effect of the Statute of 3 & 4 Wm. TV, c. 27, § 36,73 Statutes at Large 149 (1833), and continued unchanged until 1852. Under the Common - Law Pro cedure Acts of 1852,~° 1854 ~‘ and 1860 72 the Procedure in the Ac tion was simplified, the Fiction in Ejectment was abolished, so that the Action was direct ed to the person actually in possession of the property in dispute, or to any other per son entitl ed to defend the Action, and it was provided that in the Default of Appearance such person would be dispossessed.

And so the Action continued until the Supreme Court of Judicature Act of 1873,~~ under which the Action was “com menced by a Judicial Writ of Summons upon which the plaintiff indorses a Statement of his Claim with the Relief asked for, to which the defendant makes a Statement of his De fense. The Pleadings are governed by Rules of Court under General Orders made in 1883,”” Although the Remedy under this Act has lost its Earlier Form, it is still gov erned by the principles underlying the Action as Developed at Common Law. And this same Common - Law Action has been gener ally adopted, subject to modification in its Form and Procedure, as the generally recog nized mode of Trying Title or possession in the Several States of the United States. The Action of Trespass to Try Title THE Action of Trespass to Try Title has been used in three states, Alabama, South Carolina and Texas. Derived from the Action of Trespass Quai - e Clausem Fregit, it was first introduced by Statute in South Carolina in 1791,~~ being s ubstituted in the place of Ejectment. Mere possession was sufficient to support the Ac tion as against a wrong - doer, but it was not sufficient as against one with a Superior Title. And, as in Trespass, the defendant might enter a Plea of liberuni tenementw nt, that is, that the land he entered upon was owned by"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Page 67 of 735 himself, or by some one under whose authority he acted, the defendant claimed that he had an immediate Right of Entry.

This use of Tres pass to Try Title was brought about by in dorsing on the Writ of the Action for Tres pass a notice that the Action was brought to Try Title, as well as for Damages. And if the entry had ousted the plaintiff, the plaintiff if successful, was entitled to a Writ of ilabere Facias Possessionem and Damages Abolished in South Carolina in 1873,~~ it appeared in Alabama in 1821,” where it con tinued to 1852, ~ at which time it was super seded by an Action in the Nature of an Ac tion of Ejectment. In Texas, Trespass to Try Title was long the accepted and exclusive Mode for Trial of disputed Titles. As developed there it was broader than Ejectment, being maintain able even on an Equitable Title, and avail able to Try Title irrespective of occupancy. In general, the Trial was governed by the principles of Trial by Ejectment, except where the Statute p rovided otherwise. 79 Writs of Entry IN a modified Form, the Possessory Writ under this name, was adopted in Maine, Mas sachusetts and New Hampshire. 8 ° In the two latter States at least a life estate was necessary to support the action. 8 ’ Generally, the Ac tion was directed against the actual tenant of the land, but if the defendant ousted the demandant, the latter might treat the defendant as a disseisor, in order to try the right, although claiming an estate of less than a freehold. 82 Damages for Mesne Pro f 70.

The most common of these Actions are Debt, Covenant, Assumpsit, Detinue, Trespass, Trespass on the Case, Trover and Replevin. Personal Actions are divided, according to their nature, into Actions Ex Contractu and Ac tions E 7 x Delicto. The former are Actions based upon a Contract, Express or Implied; while the latter are for injuries, the right to recover for which is not based upon Contract, but upon Tort. This attempt to distribute our Personal Forms under the two he ads of Contract and Tort, as Maitland points out, has never been very successful or very im portant.° 3 Of the Forms of Action which have been enumerated above, the Action of Ejectment has been classified as a Real Action, as well as a Personal Action, as is indicated in the preceding section. In the classification of actions as Ex Contractu and Ex Delicto, some writers put Detinue on one side of the line and some on the other. The above Classification of all Personal Actions as Ex Contractu or Ex Delicto can not be supported on principle, for there are many duties imposed by Law, a Breach of which constitutes neither a Tort nor the vio lation of a Genuine Contract, as, for instance, the failure to pay a Debt imposed by Custom, Judgment or Statute. In some of these cases the Classification has been maintained by 93. Ma~tJan~l, Equity and the Forms of Action at Common Law 369 (Cambridge 1910); Pollock, Torts, Appendix A, 571 (11th ed. London 1920). Actions at Law or in Equity may be classified, ac cording to the nature of the Cause of Action, as (1) Actions of Tort; (2) Actions of Contract; (3) Ac tions on Non - Contractual Obligations; (4) Proprie tary Actions; (5) Actions of Status; and"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Page 70 of 735 (6) Pub lic Actions.

(Los Angeles & Chicago 1911). treating the Action as if arising on Contract, although clearly not so arising. In others, the duty imposed by Law so resembles the duty assumed by Contract that they have for convenience been included in Actions Ex Contractu. The Decline of the Modern Personal Actions THE Personal Actions, which, in general were of later development than the Real Ac tions, — developed out of the Action and In teraction which, over a Period of Several Cen turies, took place between the Chancery and the Three Royal Superior Courts without the aid of any Legislative Enactment, and includ ed the Actions of Debt, Covenant, Account, Detinue, Replevin, Trespass and Ej ection; also Trespass on the Case, Trover, Special Assumpsit and General Assumpsit, the devel opment of which, according to one view, was given considerable impetus, directly or mdi rectly, by the power granted to the Chancery Clerks by the Statute of West minister II (1285) ~M while others have either minimized or discounted the effect of this Statute on this development. As the Old Real and Mixed Actions declined these Personal Common - Law Actions naturally came into wider use. Their Supremacy and the Pro c edures connected therewith long stood unchallenged. But in 1834, as an Incident of a demand for improvement in Legal Pro cedure, the Hilary Rules °~ were promulgat ed. They were designed to limit the Scope of the Various General Issues in the Actions, and to restore the Ancient Strict Common - Law Theory that under a Plea of the General 94. 13 Edw.

But the effort did not stay the Movement for Re form. Under the Uniformity of Process Act, 96 enacted in 1832, the Process in the Personal Actions was made uniform. The Old Form of Writ was abolished in favor of a New, Statutory Form, which, as a parting tribute to the Old Form, was characterized by the requirement that the Pleadings should include by name one of the Recognized F orms of Actions. A second assault upon the Status of the Personal Actions came in 1852 when the Common - Law Procedure Act 97 eliminated the requirements that the plain tiff should mention in any Summons any Form or Cause of Action. Even so the Per sonal Form s of Action as developed at Com mon Law remained substantially intact, It was thus left for the final blow to be delivered by the Supreme Court of Judica ture Act of 1873,°~ and the Rules promulgat ed under its authority, which was extended in 1875?~ This Statute not only abol ished the Common - Law Forms of Action; but, following the lead of the Code Reforms in the United States, undertook to wipe out the distinctions between Law and Equity, by establishing a Single Court with both Law and Equity Jurisdicti on, so that the question in England ceased to be whether a plaintiff had a Cause of Action at Law or a Suit in Equity, and came to be one of whether he had a Cause of Action under the Law of England.’ 9°. 2 Wm.

Maitland, The Forms of Action at Common Law, Leeture 1, 8, 9, 10 (cambridge 1948). TIlE EFFECT OF TIlE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORMS OF ACTION 13. The Development of the Forms of Ac tion, both Ancient and Modern, resulted in the Creation of a Formulary System of Procedure, under which each Form of Action came to stand for a more or less Specific Theory of Liability. WITH a view of the Historical Develop ment of the Common - Law Actions, Ancient and Modem in mind, it immediately becomes evident why any attempt to define what con stitutes a “Form of Action,” in advance of such a survey, is practically meaningless. Thus, it now appear s that the student, before attempting a definition, should realize that the Forms of Action were not created at one stroke out of pre - existing raw materials; that they grew over a period of Several Cen turies; that there was more than One Set of Common - Law Actions — the Ancient Real and Mixed, and the Modem Parsonal Actions — the latter being almost completely substi tuted in lieu of the former after the Reforma tory Legislation of 1833. It appears further that the student, as a condition precedent to an under standing of the Forms of Action, should first have some appreciation of the effect of the Norman Conquest in Centraliz ing Justice in the Crown; the~.organization and Development of the Superior - Common - Law Courts and their relation to the Local Courts and Franchises; the story of the Original Writ and its creation and effect; the dependence of Right upon Remedy; the connection between the Charge in the Orig inal Writ and the Charge in the Declaration; the Power of Chancery to issue New Varie ties of Origina l Writs; the effect of the Pro visions of Oxford in 1258 in destroying Equi table Remedies based on earlier Common - Law Writs not of course, thus depriving the Common - Law Courts of the power to coerce obedience by orders in personam, and prepar ing the way for a vast expansion of Equity Jurisdiction; the various theories concern - Sec. 13 EFFECT OF DEVELOPMENT 59 ing the effect of the Statute of Westminster II (1283) upon the Writ System; the Classifica tion of the Ancient Real Actions as Proprie tary and Possessory; the ascendency and de cline of the Ancient Real Actions; the De velopment of the Modem Real Actions; and finally, the emergence of the Modern Personal Common - Law Actions. Against this back ground only is it practicable for the student to draw any clear - cut conclusions as to what constitutes a “Form of Action.” The first step in this direction ought to be that of drawing the student’s attention to the distinc tions between a “Form of Action” and a “Cause of Action”. A Cause of Action an d a Form of Action Dis tin gwished TO fully understand the Common - Law Forms of Action, the student must clearly distinguish between a Cause of Action and a Form of Action, At the very moment the first application was made to the Chancellor for the First O riginal Writ, it might be urged that there was no distinction, for until a suf ficient number of Writs had been issued to develop a body of Substantive Law, no Cause of Action could exist except as an incident of the issuance of some Form of Writ. Once a g iven Writ had been used enough to find a secure place on the Register of Writs, it be came one of a class known as the Writs of Course (brevja dc cursu), Such Writs were issued as of course to any applicant upon the payment of the appropriate fee. Writs which were issued upon application to the Chancellor, and which required an exer cise of discretion, were known as Magisterial Writs (brevia magistralia) ~2 This latte r type of Writ in the beginning was often varied to meet the varying circumstances of the Cases disclosed in the plaintiff’s Petition for Relief. Bracton, in speaking of the early Common - Law Scheme of Remedial Action, observed, Tot erunt formulae brcvium q uot stint genera actionum. There may be as many Forms of Action as there are Causes of Ac tion. As he conceived the matter the Remedy (remedium) was in exact equilibrium with jus, or, as of then, where there was a Right of Action there was a Form of Action to vindicate an Alleged Wrong. Bracton’s view was justified, for as yet, Form was the servant and had not become the master; Form had only served as a procedural de vice for securing conciseness in the state ment of the Grounds of Action. However this may be, the net result of the issuance of Writs of Course and Magisterial Writs was to develop a well - defined body of Substantive Law."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Page 72 of 735 And once such a body of Substantive Law had been developed, the distinction between a Cause of Action and a Form of Action be came vitally important if the plaintiff was to be successful in the statement of his Cause of Action. Thus, conceivably, it might be possible for a plaintiff to select the correct Form of Action to fit the particular combina tion of facts or events pres ented in his Case and yet, by failure to include in his Declara. tion one of the Allegations required by the Substantive Law as essential to the state ment of his Cause of Action, he might utter ly fail in the enforcement of his right. To illustrate, if A ousted B from Blackacre, the proper Form of Action for B to institute would be Ejectment. Since, however, under the Substantive Law of Real Property B was required to aliege Title, Ouster and Damages in order to state a good Cause of Action in Ejectment, f ailure on B’s part to allege Title would result in a failure to state a good Cause of Action. And the fact that B has selected the Correct Form of Action — Eject ment — would not save his Cause. If, how ever, the plaintiff had stated all the Allega tions requi red by the Substantive Law of Real Property as essential to the Statement of a Cause of Action in Ejectment, but had selected as his Form of Action Trespass to 2. 3 Street, Foundations of Legal Liability, C. III, 29 (Northport 1900). 60 FORMS OF ACTION Ch. 2 Real Estate, he still would have met with de feat. The phrase “Cause of Action,” there fore, ilepends upon and is prescribed by the Substantive Law applicable to the Specific Facts of the Particular Case, whereas the phrase “Form of Action” goes to t he Theory of Liability, that is, the plaintiff must state the Combination of Facts or Events on which he relies in such a manner as to invoke one of the categories of liability represented by what we cali a “Form of Action.” In other words it is descriptiv e of the technical Mode of Framing the Writ and Pleadings appro priate to the injury and to the theory of lia bility. Failure on the part of the plaintiff to achieve this end meant that his Action was dismissed. The plaintiff may therefore have failed for either of two reasons, first, because he had omitted from the Statement of his Cause of Action an Allegation required by the Substantive L aw as essential to his Cause of Action; or second, because he has not presented his Cause of Action in the category of liability as called for by a Specific Form of Action. Selecting a “Form of Ac tion,” then had to do with a theory of lia bility, it merel y involved a selection of those Allegations required by the Substantive Law as essential to the Statement of a Specific Cause of Action. 3 The Practical Importance of Distinguishing Between the Different Forms of Action IN Maitland’s famous book on the For ms of Action at Common - Law, 4 he attempts, at the inception of his treatment, to explain or define the Forms of Action by pointing out that the choice between the various Forms of Action — Novel Disseisin, Mort d’Ancestor, Writ of Entry, Quare Impedit, Covena nt, Debt, Detinue, Replevin, Trespass, Eject ment, Case and Assumpsit — ”is a choice be tween Methods of Procedure adapted to Cases of different kinds”, With the greatest defer - 3. Id. at 8, 9, 10. 4. The Forms of Action at Common Law, Lecture 1, 2, 3, 4 (Cambridge 1948). ence to such a distinguished scholar, excep tion must be taken to this statement. It is rather, as previously observed above, a choice between different theories of liability as rep resented by the various Forms of Action, Pursuin g his thought, Professor Maitland suggests, quite properly, that there were in cidental differences between the different Forms of Action with respect to: (I) Jurisdiction of the Courts. — Under this heading Professor Maitland observes that in most Civil Cas es each of the Three Royal Courts was equally competent as to Jurisdiction, an end made possible by the use of a Fiction previously explained.~ (II) Process. — Here it is pointed out that sometimes the defendant’s Appearance is compelled by a Summons and so metimes he may be Attached; or he may be forced to find gage and pledge for his Appearance. In at least one action, the Assize of Novel Dis seisin, his bailiff might be Attached."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Page 73 of 735 In the event the defendant proves contuma cious may one have his body seized , or, if he cannot be found, may he be outlawed? This barbaric Mode of Procedure was not applica ble in all Forms of Action, although the tend ency was in that direction. And the seizure of the thing in dispute varied with the Form of Action chosen. (III) Pleading. — With respect to this top ic, it is suggested that each Form of Action has some Rules which are peculiar to it; that is that the General Issue in each Form is dif ferent, as for example, Nil Debet in Debt, Non Assumpsit in Special Assumpsit, Not Guilty in Trespass to Realty, and in others Nul Tort or Nul Disseisin. (IV) Judgment by Default. — }Iere the question is raised as to whether a Judgment may be obtained against an Adversary who is persistent in his contumacy, to which the ~‘ For expansion or the Jurisdiction of the ThreO Common.Law courts sec Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions, c. I, 40 (3d ed. by Tyler, Washington, B. C. 1892). Sec. 13 EFFECT OF DEVELOPMENT 61 answer seems Yes in some Forms of Action and No in others. (V) Mode of TriaL — By the time the Forms of Action had reached a Status of Maturity, the chief Mode of Trial was by Jury. But there might be a Trial by a Grand or Petty Assize, and, of course, in a n earlier time it was still possible that the issue could be determined by Trial by Battle. And final ly, observes Professor Maitland, a few Is - sues were treated by the Judges who heard Witnesses. (VI) Judgment. — If the plaintiff secures a Judgment how may it be enforced? On Ex ecution may the plaintiff be placed in posses sion of the property in dispute? May the defendant be imprisoned or outlawed, or may he only be distrained? In addition to satis fying the plaintiff’s demand, may he also be punished for his violation of the Law, and if so, what shall be the nature of such punish ment — an Amercement, a Fine or Imprison ment? These may differ with the Form of Action. (VIE) Dilatory Character of Some Ac tions. — Some actions were susceptible to greater delay t han others. Thus, in the Old est Farms personal appearance of the parties was required, Attorneys being appointable by the King’s permission. Such Actions were subject to great delay, every type of excuse being allowed for the non - appearance, a short or a long Essoin being granted, as of course, there being no discretion. Again, in the Old er Forms, an Essoin might be granted under which a party might betake himself to his bed for a year and a day, during which pe riod of time the Action was Suspended. (V~ ) Measure of Damages and the Period of Limitations. — Ta the above we may add that the Measure of Damages differed, de pending upon what choice of Action was made, and, of course, the Statutes of Lim - itations varied according as the Form of Ac tion fell in t he Contract, Property or Tort Field. Having concluded his story of the inciden tal differences between the different Forms of Action, Professor Maitland declares that “a Form of Action” implies “a particular Original Process, a particular Mesne Proc ess, a particular Final Process, a particular Mode of Pleading, of Trial, of Judgment. But further to a very considerable degree the Substantive Law administered in a given Form of Action has grown up independently of the Law administered in other Forms. Each pr ocedural pigeon - hole contains its own Rules of Substantive Law, and it is with great caution that we may argue from what is found in one to what will probably be found in another; each has its own Precedents. It is quite possible that a litigant will find that his Case will fit some two or three of these pigeon - holes. If that be so, he will have a choice, which will often be a choice between the old, cumbrous, costly, on the one hand, the modem, rapid, cheap, on the other. Or again he may make a bad choice, fail in his Action, and take such comfort as he can from the hints of the Judges that another Form of Action might have been more suc cessful. The plaintiff’s choice is irrevoca ble; he must play the rules of the game that he has chosen. Lastly he may fin d that, plausible as his Case may seem, it just will not fit any one of the receptacles provided by the Courts and he may take to himself the lesson that where there is no Remedy there is no Wrong.” G It may be admitted, as Professor Maitland says, that t he Formulae of Pleading the Cause of Action and"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Page 74 of 735 Defense, and even the Methods of Trial, Judgment and Execution, varied with the different Forms of Action. But this was not so in the beginning; it was not and could not be so until enough Writs had been issu ed to create the Forms of Ac tion and a body of Substantive Law; these Forms of Action were not the product of a I. Maitlanci, The Forms of Action at Common Law,. Lecture J, 4, 5 (Cambridge 1948). 62 FORMS OF ACTION Ch. 2 classificatory process that was or could be applied to pre - existing materials. Drawing up a description of the incidental differences between the different Forms of Action or set ting up a Classification of the Forms of Ac tion after the fact may serve the purpose of assisting in the identification of the Actions as finally developed or it might have aided the Lawyer as a guide in the selection of a Form of Action, but neither of these steps seems calculated to define a Form of Action, or to aid a beginning student in understanding what constitutes a Form of Action prior to the time he has traced the step - by - step proc ess by which these Forms of Action finally assumed Definitive Form. A list of the in cidents of the Forms of Action and an effort at classific ation both necessarily come after the fact of Development became a reality. And all this merely emphasizes that a choice between the Various Forms of Action was a choice between different theories of liability, and not a choice between different Methods of Procedure or relief. It was the theory of liability which was the keynote in Selecting a Form of Action and not the Incidental Dif - ferences in Procedure. The proof of that is that when, under our Modern Codes, these incidental differences in Procedure wer e re moved and, under the Single, Formless Form of Action, all the Procedure in all Actions was reduced to uniformity, the Forms of Action remained. Thus, if B converted A’s watch, A was no longer to sue in the Form of Action formerly known as Trover, but in order to State a Good Cause of Action in the Nature of an Action on the Case, he was re quired to allege Possession or Right to Pos session, Act of Conversion, and Damages. The essential differences in the Forms of Ac tion were therefore in the Allegati ons neces sary to show the Right of Action, in each Form, or to invoke the correct theory of li ability represented in the selection of a Speci tic Form of Action; the incidents of Proce dural Difference probably developed in point of time long after the t heory of liability had assumed its full play, in each Form of Action. The Law of the Forms of Action, therefore, is not the Law of Pleading and Practice, al though the two are so intimately associated that it is easy to miss the distinction. The Misco’itc eption of the Form.s of Action AS an incident of the development of the Forms of Action, Two Inflexible Rules of Pleading grew up, first that the Charge in the Declaration must conform to the Charge in the Original Writ; second, that the Charge proved at the Trial must conform to the Charge in the Declaration. 7 Such Rules originated out of the fact that the Jurisdic tion of a Specific Court was limited to the identical case as authorized by the Original Writ and developed by the D eclaration. The same conformity was required in respect of the legal principle invoked, and not only in respect of the Facts alleged. Thus, as to Mat ters of Fact, the Proof must correspond with the Facts alleged; if the plaintiff Charges in his Declaratio n that the defendant took a black horse, and at the Trial offers evidence that the defendant took a white horse, he cannot succeed as he is guilty of a Variance between the Charge in the Declaration and the Proof at the Trial, which could be taken advantag e of by a Motion For a Nonsuit. For a Variance between the Declaration and the Original Writ, a Plea in Abatement was the proper procedural device.

If A in er ror sues B in Trespass, stating a case within the Law applicable to Trespass, it woul d con stitute a glaring departure from true pro - cedural principle to allow the plaintiff to re cover for the debt or the proved conversion. 8 In such a situation the plaintiff failed, be cause the Pleader, by the Form of Action in which he stated his case i nvoked a theory of liability or principle of Law relating to tres passes, whereas his right to recover was re ferable to an entirely distinct Doctrine of Law as represented by the Action of Trover. It follows therefore that the case proved is in legal impl ication entirely different from that Stated in the Declaration. 9 The same principle operates where, in an Action of Trover, the plaintiff fails in his Proof of a conversion but succeeds in establishing a trespass, and hence plaintiff fails to recover, as h e is relying upon a theory of liability for conversion which has no application to Tres pass; 10 likewise, where the plaintiff alleges Trover, but merely shows that the defendant permitted the goods to spoil; 11 under the Form of the Action of Trover, the theory is one of liability for a conversion, but the true theory of liability is one for negligence which invokes another doctrine of law entirely dif ferent in origin and in theory from that in voked by the Action of Trover.

Moreover, if in Debt, the Pleadings and Proof show that the defend ant, not being indebted to the plaintiff, proftr ised to pay to the plaintiff a debt owed by a third person, the plaintiff cannot recover, there being no obligation imposed by the Law upon the defendant to pay the debt; the defendant, if liable, was liable under a legal doctrine based upon a Breach of Promise. The mistake made by suing in a Form of Action which expresses a theory of liability not available in the case which the plaintiff has stated and proved is known as a Miscon ception of the Form of Action. Such a De fect is one of Substance, and has been insist ed upon as a Fatal Defect, as it has been the po licy of the Courts to preserve the Distinc tions Between the Actions, 13 which in fact merely amounts to the observance of the differences between the distinct theories of liability or principles of Law.’ 4 The History of the Forms of Action is the History of Substantive Law ‘~ THE Rules of the Substantive Law of Con tract, Property and Tort have been evolved by inquiring in a myriad of specific in stances whether the Combination of Facts or 12.

(1591). Koffler & ReppycomLaw PId g. H.B. — 4 Events of the plaintiff’s case were covered by any recognized theory of liability, as rep resented by a Particular Form of Action. The primary question before the Courts was not one of whether the plaintiff in the state ment of his case had alleg ed a right in him, a violation of that right by the defendant, and Damages. It has been rather,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Page 76 of 735 whether the Operative Facts presented constituted a Cause of Action which fit into the theory of liability as represented by some Specific Form of Action, such as Assumpsit, or Tres pass. This was neither a Matter of Pleading nor of Procedure generally; it was a ques tion of Remedial Right, the existence of the Right being dependent upon the existence of a Remedy. From this it may be inferred that the list - of O riginal Writs not only determined the Jurisdiction of the Royal Superior Common - Law Courts, but it determined the existence of Remedial Rights and Liabilities. Long after the Original Writs ceased to be essen tial to authorize the Courts to act in a spe ci fic case, the Judges felt impelled to consid er the case exactly as if it had been begun by an Original Writ and to govern the exer cise of their Jurisdiction according to the recognized occasions of Remedy. Even though the Writs became in time a mere for mality, and were superseded as the Method of Commencing the Action, the Principle of Jurisdiction remained as if still actually gov erned by the Original Writ, and the theories of liability, as if represented by the various Forms of Action, were still obse rved as being the sole occasion of remedial intervention. 10 The list of Original Writs as recorded in Chancery or as they appeared in the Regis 16. “The Writs were like doors to the King’ s Courts; there was one for big dogs and a smaller one for little dogs; there were doors for yellow dogs and black dogs, and the door of Case for mongrel curs of no particular breed, but lust plain dogs.” Ship. man, Handbook of Common - Law Pleading, 60, a 1 1 (St. Paul 1923). Ch. 2 1mm Brevum’ 7 was not a reasoned or well - rounded Scheme of Remedial Justice; it was not the product of a skilled Legislator select ed by providence to calmly devise theorems of Remedial Rights for all conceivable wrongs. Nor was this list the result of a rational Classification of Theories of Liabil ity or of Causes of Action according to the character of the Rights and claims to be pre sented; the Forms of Action, representing Theories of Liability, were relatively few and arbitr ary, when measured by the myriads of human situations in which human beings were bound to be seeking some Form of Re medial Relief. Nor were the Theories of Lia bility as seen in the Forms of Action compre hensive and logical; they just grew; yet the strea m of rights flowed down these chan nels, with the well recognized result that the history of these Theories of Liability is the History of the Development of English Sub stantive Law. Thus when Glanvill and Brac ton wrote concerning the Law of England they were compelled to write about the Writs, as the Law could only be found in their in terstices. In their thy this involved the Forms of Action known as the Ancient Pro prietary and Possessory Real Actions; in a later or more modern day a discussion of Debt , Covenant, Account or Assumpsit, is necessarily a discussion of the development of the Law of Contracts; that of Trespass and Case is a discussion of the Law of Torts; that of Detinue, Replevin, Ejectment and Trover is usuaily a discussion of Property; in short, a History of the Forms of Action, both Ancient and Modern, would fall little short of a Complete History of the Common Law. Had the authority of the Clerks in Chancery been less restricted in their prac tice of issuing New Writs and had the Judg es been more liberal in extending the Reme - dial Scope of the various Forms of Action, 17. See Maitland, History of the Register of Orig Inal WrIts, 3 Harv.L.Rev. 97, 167, 212 (1889), it - printed In 2 Select Essays In Anglo - American Legal History, 549 (CambrI dge 1908). 64 FORMS OF ACTION Sec. 13 EFFECT OF DEVELOPMENT 65 and particularly the Great Residuary Rem edy of the Common Law — the Action of Trespass on the Case — their Remedies might have effectually answered many of the pur poses of a Court of Equity and t hus made its creation unnecessary. The Law was required to express itself through the Limited System of Writs and Forms of Action sanctioned by precedent, and little discretion was left to the Judge. The Common Law, thus hampered and re stricted was found insufficient to meet cer tain demands for Justice; a distinct Tribu nal arose, so it is said, to supply the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Page 77 of 735 deficien cies of the Common Law and to give Justice where the Common Law Remedies were in adequate, namely, the Court of Chancery, which in legal t heory gave a Remedy where there was a right, on principles of natural justice, to meet the exigencies as they arose, so that no wrong should exist without a rem edy. Aside from the soundness of these last observations concerning the Supplementary Functions of Equity, it is clear that the Classification and Definition of the Different Species of Contracts and Tarts, even at the present day, are based on the historic dis tinction between the different theories of liability as represented by the Forms of Ac ti on and the Remedies available thereunder. The test of the existence of liability and of the amount of Damages due may depend up on whether one Form or another is applica ble. It follows, therefore, that in order to understand the intricacies of the Law, it is necessary to approach it by the study of the various theories of Remedial Right available under the Forms of Action at Common Law which have been recognized by the Courts. Or, to put the matter in a broader way, practically all of our Modern Substantiv e Contract, Property and Torts Law, had its origin in and developed out of the Theo ries of Liability represented by the Forms of Action and the Procedural Incidents thereto. The Phrqse~ “Form of Action” Defined WITH the distinction between a Cause of Action and a Form of Action in mind, with some understanding of the different Doc trines of the Different Actions, with some comprehension of what constitutes a Miscon - ception of a Form of Action, as ~veIl as the knowledge that the History of the Forms of Action is the History of Substantive Law, we are at last ready to attempt to define a “Form of Action.” The phrase “Form of Action” has been de fined as the “technical Mode of Framing the Writ, and Pleadings appropriate to the partic ular injury”,’ 8 as the Method of Procedure adapted to a specific kind of case. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The law governing Forms of Action is not the Law of Pleading or Procedure, though it is close ly associated therewith. The choice of One Form of Action over A nother is primarily a choice between different Theories of Sub stantive Liability, and the Scope of the Vari ous Actions measures the existence and ex tent of liability at Common Law. In other words the Cause of Action had to fit the Theory of Liability as represented by a Spe cific Form of Action. And this remained true even when the incidental differences in procedure were removed, and the Procedure in All Actions was reduced to uniformity. Thus, after England and most states abol ished the necessity of c hoosing one of these specified theories in Commencing an Action, the Forms of Action remained in substance. “The Forms of Action we have buried.” Yet, though we have buried them, observes Pro fessor Maitland, “. . . they still rule us from their graves.” 1 9 The names and the - aries of the Forms of Action as they existed at Common Law still indicate the Recognized 18. 2 Warren, Law Studies, 759 (3d ed.

Maitland, The Forms of Action at Common Law, Lecture 1, 2 ~Cambridge 1948). 66 FORMS OF ACTION Ch. 2 Causes of Action, the occasions of liability, and the starting point of legal doctrine. The essential differences were in the Allegations of Fact necessary to show the Right of Ac tion in each Form; in other words, in their respective grounds and theories of liability. And this is true even under the Code~° Some cases may fall under two or three of these theories of liability, and a litigant will have a choice or Election between them. By way of summary then, it may be as serted that a “Farm of Action” is not a choice between Methods of Procedure or Re lief; it is not to be confused with a Cause of Action; it is not a General Demand for Re ilef based on a Specific Wrong as might be made under a Non - Formulary system of pro cedure. Rather a “Form of Action” may be defined as a Procedural Device whereby the primitive mind gave concrete expression to a theory of liability; it is a mechanism through which the doctrine or principle of Law applicable to the Statement of a Plain - tiff’s Cause of Action may be enforced; it provides a scheme whereby it may be deter mined whether the plaintiff’s alleged Cause of Action fits into any judicially recognized Theory of Liability; it is a device, an inci dence of the existence of which determines the Formulae of Pleading the Cause of Ac tion and Defence, the Method of Proof and Trial, and the Judgment and Execution, these varying with each Form of Action; it is the Frame within which a"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Page 78 of 735 plaintiff could suggest the facts constituting his Claim for Relief in accordance with the appropriate Rule of Sub - stantive Law applicable th ereto; and finally, it is the mechanism through which an un named short, but not unidentifiable Charge in the Original Writ — the keynote of the Form of Action — is, through the Statement of the SO. “While the New Rules have abolished the dis tinctive Common - Law Forms, the essential and dif ferentlathig Rules applicable to Pleading as estab. flailed at Common Law sUn sun,tve as a Basis of Remedial Law.” Minturn, S, In Ward t Huff, 94 N.J.L. 81, 84, 109 A. 287, 288 (1*20). Substantive Facts in the Declaration, con verted into an enforceable liability, the Dec laration as finally developed being but an amplification of the Original Writ, “with the additional circumstances of time and place” 21 set forth in a more narrative and spacious form. The Mode of Pleading Under Modern Codes and Practice Acts THE Forms of Action as finally developed are usually associated and discussed with Common Law Pleading, but they relate to the Substantive Law of Contract, Prop erty and Tort rather than to Procedure. Forms of Action a re the recognized Theories of Liability through which the Common Law Rights of Action have been evolved, classified and formulated. As such they are much more important than any mere Rules of Pleading. The abolition of the requirement of selecting a partic ular one of these theories of liability has emancipated Pleading from arbitrary Variations of Procedure in differ ent kinds of Actions. While necessarily the Rights and Liabilities and Defenses depend on Substantive Law, only the manner in which the Calm or Defense shall be set forth depends upon Rules of Pleading, which are made the same for All Actions in Modern Procedure. But there are still many Code States which insist that the Pleader shall se lect and adhere to some Theory of Liabilit y in stating his Cause of ActionP The Forms of Action, and the necessity of choosing between them, have been abolished by the Codes in the Several States, following the pattern set by the New York Code of Procedure of 1848.23 Thus, in New York, 21. 3 Bla ckstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of Eng land, 293 (7th ed.

The distinctions between Actions at Law and Su its in Equity, and the Forms of those Actions and Suits, have been abolished.” 24 In the famous New York case of Goulet v. Asseler, 25 in reference to this type of Statute Abolish ing the Forms of Action, Selden, J., ob served: “ Although the Code [of Procedure] has abolished 26 all distinction between the mere Forms of Action, and every Action is now in Form a Special Action on the Case, yet Actions vary in their Nature, and there are intrinsic differences between them which No La w can abolish. It is impossible to make an Action for a direct aggression upon the plaintiff’s rights, by taking and disposing of his property, the same thing, in Substance 24. New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, § 103 (a) (1968), contains this provisi on. 25. 22 N.Y. 225 (1860). or in Principle, as an Action to recover for the consequential injury resulting from an improper interference with the property of another, in which he has a contingent or pro spective interest. The mere Formal Differ ences bet ween such Actions are abolished; the Substantial Differences remain as before. The same Proof, therefore, is required in each of these Two Kinds of Actions, as be fore the Code, and the same Rule of Dam ages applies.” 27 In many of the States which retain the Forms of Action, the Common Law Forms have been combined or modified by Statute. In Massachusetts, actions were Classified as either in Contract or Tort, while in"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Page 79 of 735 Michigan, at one time at least, Contract Actions were all called Assumpsit, and Tort Acti ons for Damages were called Trespass on the Case. 27.

First, then, a word about the Courts, which administered the Common - Law. 68 Sec. 14 THE COURT 69 THE COURT 14. A Court is a tribunal duly constituted, and present at the time and place fixed by Law for Judicial Investigation and Determina tion of Controversies. And there are Courts of General and Special Jurisdiction, Courts of Original and Appellate Jurisdiction and Courts of Record and Not of Record. The procedure under which these Courts operate may be gov erned by Legislative Rules or Rules of Court, the modern tendency being in the direction of the latter method. In General WHEN a client consults a lawyer concern ing some controversy in which he is involved, what he wishes to know is whether he has a civil action against his adversary. “A civil action at Common Law is a proceeding in a Court of Justice for the purpose of obta ining redress for the violation of a legal right.” ~ If, after an analysis of the Facts of the client’s case, the lawyer decides that he has a Cause of Action, then he must determine what Court has Jurisdiction over the supposed ac tion. Therefore, before considering the Prob lem of Jurisdiction, it may be well to inquire as to what is a Court? According to .Ander son’s Law Dictionary the word “Court” originally could signify only a yard or palace, and according to Cowel it meant the house where the King re mained with his retinue; also the place where Justice was admin istered. 4 In early Anglo - Saxon and Anglo - Norman times it referred to the place of the King’s domicile as the King was the fountain - head and Dispenser of Justice. During this primitive period o f development S. Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, e.

DictIonary of Law (Chicago, 1889). the Courts were popular assemblages held in the courtyar d of the baron or of the King himself by those whose duty it was to ap pear at stated times or upon Summons. With this idea in mind Blackstone defined a Court as “a place where Justice is Judicially Ad ministered,” and at least one American Court accepted his definition.° But it has been regarded as too narrow, it being conclud ed that a Court is a tribunal duly con stituted and present at the time and place fixed by law for Judicial Investigation and Determination of Controversies. 7 And it has sometimes be en regarded as an incor poreal thing requiring for its existence the’ presence of a Judge. It should, however, be understood that the Court does not consist of the Judge or Judges as individuals, but only when at the proper time and place they are exercisi ng their Judicial powers. 8 And there are different kinds of Courts, as, for example, when viewed from the standpoint of Jurisdiction, Different Kinds of Courts THUS, Courts may be either one or two descriptions — of General Jurisdiction or of Special Juris diction. As classified in this manner, it is observed that a Court with Gen eral Jurisdiction is one which has all the pow er which a Superior Court of the Common Law had, and it may hear a wide variety of cases. A Court of Special Jurisdiction is one whos e Jurisdiction is limited by Constitution or Statute and hence may only hear and de cide specific cases. When the Court is one of General Jurisdiction, its Jurisdiction is pre sumed and need not be expressly asserted by the plaintiff; but when the Jurisdic tion is"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Page 81 of 735 5. 3 CommentarIes on the Laws of England, c.

Original Jurisdic tion consists of a Court’s authority to decide a case in the first instance; and Appellate Jurisdiction consists of the Court’s author ity to review and correct the errors alleged to have been committed by a lower or Sub ordinate Court. To put the matter a nother way, the Court of Original Jurisdiction is a Trial Court, readily accessible to the people in such locality where the witnesses are heard and a Judgment is rendered, whereas a Court of Appellate Jurisdiction acts upon the Record made in the lower Co urt; it is farther removed from the people and among its purposes is not only that of reviewing the errors of inferior Courts, but also that of bringing uniformity in the law throughout the territory over which it exercises Appel late Jurisdiction. Courts may also be either of record or not of record.’° The former includes Courts in which the proceedings therein are recorded on parchment for a perpetual memorial and testimony, the Records of which may be of fered in other Courts as conclusive evidence of t he facts stated, ~‘hereas the latter refers to a Court whose Records are not so regard ed in other Courts, or at most are regarded only as prima fade evidence of the facts stat ed therein. By Statute in some states the Statute of Limitations on a Judgment of Record is twenty years; on a Judgment of a Court not of Record six years. 1 ’ JURISDICTION OF COURTS i5. Jurisdiction depends upon authority over the subject~matter and over the parties. IN general, Jurisdiction is the power of a Court to hear cases and decide them by pro. 9. See Repp~’, Introduction to Civil Procedure, e. II, The Commencement of an Action, ~ 1, PrelimInary Matters, Note 2 (Buffalo, 1954). 1~. mid. 11. Ibid. nouncing Judgment. And the power to ren der Judgment depends: (1) upon Jurisd ic tion over the subject - matter of the action or of the class of cases; and (2) upon Jurisdic tion over the parties.’ 2 Derivation of Jurisdiction THE Judicial Powers and the Jurisdiction of the Courts of the States and of the United States are in general derived from their re spective Constitutions and are further de fined and fixed by Statutes enacted thereun der. Such Written Law prescribes the Na ture of the Causes that may be brought with in the cognizance of the respective Courts . In England, however, and by way of con trast, the source of the power and authority of the Common Law Courts to afford the re lief asked was anciently the Original Writ, a delegation from the King in each instance. Such a Writ was the warrant of authorit y under which a particular Common Law Court took cognizance of the cause,’ 3 In course of time the Jurisdiction of the Law Courts be came fixed and established as to those mat ters in which Writs were demandable of com mon right. In time, however, Original Writs fell out of use as a regular means of Com mencing an Action. Nonetheless they left behind them a dearly defined Jurisdiction and the limited system of remedies under the Forms of Action, each of which will be con sidered in detail.

Thus, under the C on stitution, the Supreme Court had Original Jurisdiction only “in all cases affecting Am bassadors, other public Ministers and Con suls, and those in which a State shall be a Party.”” In all other cases, the Supreme Court had Appellate Jurisdiction over c ertain decisions of the State Supreme Courts, and the Inferior Federal Courts, “with such Ex ceptions, and under such Regulations as Con gress shall make.” 18 Duality of Jurisdiction IN England, even after some elasticity was afforded by the flexible natu re of the Action on the Case, a large Jurisdiction was still unprovided I or. To meet this lack of remedy, it is said that the Court of Chan - cery was created, in which the Chancellor 14. See Baldwin, The American Judiciary, 125, 174 (New York 1905). 15. U.S.Const., art.

The Jurisdiction of Eq uity was residuary and supplemental to the Law, based on a delegation by the Council of Judicial Authority not previously dele - gated to the older Courts. Such is the source of the great division of Jurisdiction into Le gal and Equitable, allotting certain kinds of actions and relief to one set of Courts and the remainder to another. The line of de markation between Legal and Equitable Ju risdiction is thus historical in origin and ar bitrary in fact. Nevertheless, the duality of Courts and Jurisdiction has to be kept con stantly in mind, as it had a direct bear ing upon how Jurisdiction in a given case was to be secured by the Common Law Courts and the Court of Chancery, and the powers which they exercised.

Judicial Process was by Summons, Attachment, Arrest or Outlawry. tn General ACCORDING to Miller, 20 in practically all Systems of Procedure, the Parties to an Ac ti on are entitled to be heard or to have an opportunity to be heard, before the Judicial Machinery of a State becomes operative. In the United States, under both State and Fed eral Constitutions, due process of law re quires due notice and an opportunity to be heard.° 1 It follows, therefore, that in order to Commence an Action, it is highly essen tial that the defendant shall have due notice and an opportunity to present his version of the controversy. This was the primary func tion of Judicial Process in its various forms. Original Writ AT Common Law, as previously observed, an action was begun by suing an Original Writ out of Chancery, in the King’s name, which served the purpose of ordering the Sheriff to give the defendant notice, deter mined the character of the action, and au burgh 1727); Bohure, The English Lawyer, Show ing the Nature and Forms of Original Writs (Lon don, 1732).

Substituted in lieu of the Original Writ, the Modern Summons is also issued in the name of the Sovereign, and is directed against the defendant. Although the Summons does not have all of the attributes of the Or iginal Writ, it does serve as an effective instrument for Commencing an Action. With these com ments in mind, we may now consider the varieties of Judicial Process by which Juris diction over the parties to an action may be acquired. Commencement of an Ac tion in Modern Practice IN Modern Practice the Original Writ is no longer used either as authority for insti tuting an action, or for the purpose of com pelling appearance by the defendant, 2 though in some of our states the term is re tained to designate t he process that has talc - en its place. No Writ at all is necessary for instituting actions, and the Writ of Sum mons is used as a means of notifying the de fendant of the suit and ordering him to ap pear in Court. The practice is very general ly, if not en tirely, regulated by Statutes, varying somewhat from State to"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Page 84 of 735 State. The general practice is for the attorney, in Commencing an Action, to draw up, sign and present to the Clerk of the Court, an order requesting him to issue a Summons. This order is calle d a praccipe. It is not es - sential to the validity of the Summons, but is used merely as a convenient way of di recting the Clerk as to its issuance. A ver bal direction would do as well~ 22.

PROCESS — THE ORIGINAL WRIT Summons and Arrest 24 THE first Process upon the Original Writ in tontract actions and for civil injuries un accompanied by force was a Summons, or warning to a ppear according to the com mand of the Writ itself, made out by the plaintiff’s attorney for the Sheriff, and de livered by one of his deputies to the defend ant.

Such a Writ always issued before Judg ment, and thus differs from an Execution, which is the Process issued after Judgment, In some States it can be issued only against absconding debtors or persons concealing themselves, or nonresidents; in others, it is issued, in the first instance, to obta in control over the property of the defendant with which to satisfy the Judgment. At Common Law, the Attachment was used to compel the appearance of the defend ant, and, when he has appeared, the Attach ment was dissolved. There was no lien up on the good s to secure the debt. The Writ is now issued to attach personal property and real estate to respond to the Judgment. The defendant may appear or not, after having been served with the Summons; if not, he is defaulted, and the Attachment constitutes a ilen on the goods for the payment of the claim sued on, which may be enforced by Execution. The defendant may, however, generally appear at any time before Judg ment, and dissolve the Attachment by giving a bond, in which case the attached property is released, the bond standing in its place. 2 ’ 380 (1897); Johnson, Attachment of Choses in Ac tion in New York, 13 N.Y.U.L.Q.Rev. 37 (1930); Wolf & Michael, Property Interests Subject to At tachment for Constructive Service in Ohio, 21 U.

Jurisdiction to render a Personal Judg ment is based on Personal Service of a Sum mons, or sometimes on Substituted Service. Jurisdiction in Rem, and Quasi in Rem is based on Constructive Service by Publication and Control of some rca. In General PERSONAL Judgment must be based up on Personal Service of Summons upon the defendant, or in case o f residents upon Sub stituted Service. Constructive Service of Process by Publication is by Statute author ized where the Court has Jurisdiction in Rem or Quasi in Rem. For the latter case seizure of some property by Attachment or otherwise is necessary. 3 ° PERSONAL Judgments must be based up on Defendant Personally THERE is a most important distinction be tween the Jurisdiction which is based on per sonal service, 3 ’ and Jurisdiction which is bas ed upon control over some res or subject matter, which is und er the power of the Court. Only by virtue of Personal Jurisdic tion can the Court render a personal Judg ment and create a personal obligation which will bind all the defendant’s property every where. The ordinary method by which a Court gets authority to adjudicate upon the rights and liabilities of the defendant is by Service of Summons upon him personally within the state. There are statutory provisions as to the officer or agent upon whom the Summons shall be served in actions against corpora tions. Th e service, when personal, may be made at any time after the Writ comes into the hands of the officer, but not later than the time fixed by Statute, which may be the Return Day or a certain time before. The officer is bound to use due diligence in serving 3°. Pennoyer V. Neff, 05 U.s. 714, 24 LEd. 565 (1S77). 31. Supra, tote 24. it, and is liable for neglect or a false Return.

The act of notifying him of the Commence ment of the Action is generally performed by reading the Writ to him, or handing him a copy of it, or, as is n ow generally provided by Statute, by leaving a copy at his last usual place of abode, if he has one within the Jurisdiction of the Court. 33 Substituted Service SUBSTITUTED Service, by leaving a copy of the Summons at the defendant’s residence or usual pla ce of abode, may by Statute be made equivalent to Personal Service as to a resident defendant, and it will support a Personal Judgment. “Substituted Service in actions in personam is a departure from the Common Law Rule requiring Personal Serv ice, and the Statute authorizing such service must be followed strictly. But when the Stat ute is complied with, the general rule is that Substituted Service on a resident defendant is equivalent to Personal Service and war rants a Personal Judgment.” ~ 32. In gen eral on Personal Service, see: Article: Burdick, Service in Actions in Personam, 20 Mich.

Mere temporary presence in the state is sufficient to subject the non - resident indi vidual to its power if Personal Service of Summons is secured therein, even if the defendant is merely passing through on a train. But foreign corporations cannot be served, unless doing business in the state. When once obtained, Jurisdiction continues through all subse quent proceedings in the same litigation without further notice.

All proceedings are really directed against persons and their rights, even though, as in admiralty, a res or ship be impleaded as defendant. Some notification of the proceeding s is therefore essential, either by publication in newspapers, or by posting up notices, or by mailing notices to the last known address, or by service of Summons outside of the state. A Court order must in general be obtained to make service of the Summon s by Publication or other substituted method, upon a showing by affidavit that Personal Service within the state cannot be had. 37 Constructive Service: Jurisdiction Quasi - in - Rem THERE has been a wide extension of the Doctrine of Jurisdiction in Rem to cas es where there is no direct claim to a tangible ret Thus, where a suit is brought upon an obligation against a non - resident debtor, the 37.

Sec. 17 SERVICE — PERSONAL & CONSTRUCTiVE 77 Court may subject the property of the debtor within the state to the payment of the debt, even though no Personal Jurisdiction over him can be acquired. No claim is made to the property as such, the plaintiff is not seeking to cut off the defendant’s right, title or interest in the property as against the whole world; he does have an interest in the property , but it Is purely incidental to the satisfaction of his claim for the redress of a wrong, any surplus remaining there after going to the defendant, and not to the plaintiff. It is held that where a claim is made to property indirectly to thus satisfy an o bligation of a non - resident debtor, an Attachment or Garnishment or Receivership is necessary. Since the action is not so framed as to set up any direct claim to the res in the sense of seeking to cut off the defendant’s interest as against the whole world , a claim to specific property, as an incidental method of obtaining redress for a wrong, must be asserted in some manner, since Jurisdiction is based upon that. And the defendant must have notice of that claim in order to satisfy the requirements of due p rocess of law. And the method of giving such notice is by seizure of the property by the Court prior to service by publication. 38 Such seizure will give the Court Jurisdiction Quasi in Rem. A Judgment based on such Jurisdiction is not in personarn, and in this regard it is to be observed that the only ef fect of the Judgment is to enable the plaintiff to satisfy his claim out of the attached prop erty; any part of the property after the payment of the plaintiff’s demand remains the property of the defendant , although the 38. The leading ease on the necessity àf seizure by the court in order to properly ground Service by Publication In suits Quasi in Rem, is Pennoyer V. Neff, 95 U.S. 714,24 LEd. 565 (1877). See, also, the following cases: Baillie v. Columbi a Gold Mm. co., 86 Or. 1, 22, 42, 168 P. 965, rehearing denied 86 Or. 1, 161 F. 1167 (1917).

Th e Operation of the Doctrine of Quasi in Rem Jurisdiction is best illustrated by the case of Pennoyer v. Neff ~ in which appeared that A, in the state of Oregon, was sued in Debt for service rendered by an attorney; that at the time the action began and the Judgment was rendered, A, the then defendant, was a non - resident of the state; that he was not personally served with Pro cess, and did not appear therein; and that the Judgment was entered upon his default in not answering the complaint, upon a Con struc tive Service of Summons by Publica tion. Such service when an action is brought against a non - resident and absent defendant, who has property within the state, was pro -"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Page 89 of 735 vided for by the Code of Oregon. The Code also provided, where the action was for the re covery of money or damages, for the Attachment of the property of the non - resi dent. It also declared that no natural person was subject to the Jurisdiction of a Court of the State “unless he appear in the Court, or be found within the State, or be a resid ent thereof, or have property therein; and, in the last case, only to the extent of such prop erty at the time the Jurisdiction attached.” The plaintiff, B, in the original action having secured a Default Judgment for less than $300 including costs, sued out an Exe cution on the Judgment, and C acquired the premises in question under a Sheriff’s deed, made upon a sale of the property on Execu tion issued upon the Judgment. Thereafter, A, the defendant in the original action, sued o in Ejectment to recover the land, of the alleged value of $15,000, situated in the State of Oregon. The issue thus presented was whether the Judgment in the State Court 38. 95 U.S. 714, 24 LEd. 565 (1877). a.

Mr . Justice Field, speaking for the United States Supreme Court, held that the Judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the Circuit Court should be affirmed, because the only question was as to the validity of the original money Judgment rendered in Oregon, in an Action of Debt on a Simple Contract, against the resident of another state, without his voluntary appearance, or personal service of process upon him, by At tachment of the property subsequent to the commencement of the Action. Prior At ta chment was and is necessary in order to give notice to the defendant that his property was involved in litigation. Without such notice the defendant’s property might be taken without a hearing or an opportunity to be heard, which would be violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amend ment. Finally, it is interesting to observe that in the principal case, even the Supreme Court failed to distinguish clearly between Jurisdiction in Rem as opposed to Jurisdic tion Quasi in Rem. 4 ’ TIlE APPEARANCE ’ 2 18.

The Doctrine of Appearance properly re lates to the defendant, as his actual presence in person or through his attorney was a condition precedent to any Form of Pleading, to any Trial, or to any Judgment in the case. An Appearance is any unequivocal act by which a defendant submits to the Juris dic tion of the Court in a Cause of Action.” This is, in effect, a definition of a General Appearance. A Special Appearance is one made for the purpose of objecting to the Court’s Jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action or over the person of the de fendant. If the Court has not previously acquired Jurisdiction of the defendant, such an appearance enables the defendant to ob - ject to the control, without submitting him self to its jurisdiction. 47 Under Modern Law a Court can acquire Jurisdiction t o render a Judgment in person - ant eithcr by a General Appearance on the part of the defendant or by the Personal Ser vice of a Summons. If, however, the defend ant or his attorney does any act with ref er ence to the Defense of the action, he will be held to have submitted himself to the author ity of the Court, or to have made a General Appearance, the effect of which is to cure all prior defects in the service. 48 Since Juris diction over subject matter is defined by Constitution or Statute in America, con sent of the parties cannot confer such Jurisdiction upon the Court, and therefore an Appearance It Ridgway v. homer, 55 NiL. 84, 85, 25 A. 386, 387 (1892).

The English Courts did not, until modern times, claim Jurisdiction over the person of the defendant merely by service of Sum mons upon him. If he failed to appear in response to the Summons, it was deemed necessary to resort to further Process by Attachmen t of his Property and Arrest of his Person to compel an “appearance”, which was not mere presence in the Court, but which consisted of some act by which a person submitted himself to the authority and Jurisdiction of the Court. If he still failed to appear , no Judgment could be ren dered against him, except in Real Actions where the defendant was proceeding against the Jand within the Jurisdiction. Any steps in the action, such as giving bail 50 upon arrest, operated as an appearance or sub mission."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Page 91 of 735 Under later English law, by Statute, the plaintiff was authorized upon affidavit of Personal Service of a Summons or a Writ of Distringas, to enter the appearance of the defendant, and proceed to Judgment, if he failed to appear within a certain prescribed time.

Under Modern Law there is no effort to compel the appearance of the defendant. But if he be properly served and then neg lects to Appear and Plead, the Court will render Judgment against him for Default of Appearance. Inasmuch as the Default con stitutes a n admission of the Cause of Action set forth in the Declaration, assuming of course that the plaintiff has stated a Cause of Action, all that the plaintiff would have to prove is his damages. TIlE PLEADINGS 19. On the Appearance of the Parties, the Plead ings Commence. The Various Pleadings and their order are as follows: (I) The Declaration of the plaintiff. The Dilatory Pleas of the defendant. The Demurrer or Plea of the defend ant. (IV) The Demurrer or Replication of the plaintiff. (V) The Demurrer or Rejoinder of the de fendant. (VI) The Demurrer or Surrejoinder of the plaintiff. (VII) The Demurrer or Rebutter of the de fendant. (VIII) The Demurrer or Surrebutter of the plaintiff. 51.

These Oral Pleadings were delivered either by the Party himself or his Pleader, called ‘nar rator’ and ‘advocatus’ ; and it seems that the Rule w as then already established that none but a regular advocate (or, according to the more modern term, ‘barrister’) could be a Pleader in a cause not his own. “It was the office of the Judges to super intend, or, according to the allusion of a learned write r, moderate the oral conten tion thus conducted before them. In doing this, their general aim was to compel the Pleaders so to manage their Alternate Allegations as at length to arrive at some specific point or"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Page 92 of 735 matter affirmed on the one side and denied on the other. When this matter was attained, if it proved to be a Point of Law, it fell, of course, to the deci sion of the Judges themselves, to whom alone the adjudication of all legal questions be longed; but, if a Point of Fact, the parties then, by mutu al agreement, referred it to one of the various Methods of Trial then practiced, or to such Trial as the Court should think proper. This result being at tained, the parties were said to be at issue (ad exitum; that is, at the end of their pleading). The qu estion, so set apart for decision was itself called ‘the issue’, and was designated, according to its nature, either as an ‘issue in fact’ or an ‘issue in law’. The whole proceeding then closed, in case of an Issue in Fact, by an award or order of the Cour t, directing the institution, at a given time, of the Mode of Trial fixed upon; 55.

The Modern Practice is to draw up Written Pleadings in typewritten form, and file them in the office of the proper officer of the Court, usually the Clerk’s office. Here the opposite party may examine a pleading, or he may procure a copy from the officer; or it may be that under the statutes of the particular state, or a Rule of the Court, a copy may be required to be delivered to him. Whe n the Pleadings are thus filed they be come a part of the Record of the cause. They are not, as formerly, transcribed, but are themselves properly indorsed and kept on file as part of the Record.

With the Form of a Specific Declaration in Assumpsit before us, the Declaration may now be examined, first, With reference to its formal parts and general compositional and physi cal structure, and secondly, with refer ence to the usual factors and rules which govern the statement of a cause of action in any form; the problem of stating a cause of action in terms of each of the eleven specific Common Law Actions will follow in late r chapters. The Caption or Title of the Court and Term WITH respect to the Title of the Court, it consists, in general, of a superscription of the Name of the Court, thus, “In the Cir cuit Court of County.” With respect to the Entitlement of Term, it is e ither Gen - era], thus, “October Term, 1955,” or Special, that is where a particular day of the term is stated. Such Title refers to the time when 83 COMMENCE MENT: form: Breach: Damage: CONCLU SION: Considera tion or Promise: 84 DECLARATION — FORM Ch. 4 the party is supposed to deliver his Oral Al legation in Open Court; and as it was only in Term Time that the Court anciently sat to hear the pleading, it is therefore always of a Term that the pleadings are entitled, though they are often in fact filed or deliv ered in Vacation Time. The Term of which any pleading is entitled is usually that in which it is actually filed or delivered, or when this takes place in vacation, the Title is of the Term last preceding. The most frequent pr actice is to Entitle Generally. But it is to be observed that a pleading so entitled is by"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Page 95 of 735 construction of the law presumed, unless proof be given to the contrary, to have been pleaded on the first day of the Term. And the effect of this is that, if a Gene ral Title is used, it will some time occasion an apparent objection. Thus, in the case of a Declaration so Entitled, it may appear in the Declaration or in evidence on the Trial that the Cause of Action arose after the first day of the Term of which the De claration is Entitled; and in either case this objection would arise: that the plaintiff would appear to have declared before his cause of action accrued, whereas the Cause of Action ought of course always to exist at the time the action is commenced. 3 The means of avoiding this difficulty is to Entitle Specially of the particular day in the Term when the pleading was actually filed or de livered. The Venue 4 THE laying of Venue was inextricably con nected with the various stages of the devel 3. See English: Pugh v. Robinson, 1 T.R. 116, 99 Eug. Rep. 1004 (1786); New York: Paul v. Graves, 5 Wend. (N.Y.) 16 (1830). 4. In general, on the subject of Venue in Common Law and Modern Actions, see: Treatises: flayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law, c, II, Trial by Jury and Its Devi1opment, 65, 90 — 93 (Boston 1898); Scott, Fun damental Principles of Procedure In Actions at opment of the Jury. In the first stage the Jury was not a Jury, but in reality a group of witnesses who came into C ourt, and on the basis of their own knowledge of the facts of the specific case, told the Judge what hap pened. In order, therefore, that the juror or jurors with knowledge of the facts might be selected, it was necessary for the sh eriff to know where they could be located. The rule at Common Law, therefore, was that every material and traversable allegation of fact in the Body of the Declaration, if affirmative in form, should be laid with a Venue. Be sides this Venue, which, by the ancient prac tice, included the parish, town or hamlet, as well as the county, there was another laid on the margin of the Declaration, at its Com mencement, stating merely the name of the county. In the second stage of the development the Jury went part ly on its own knowledge, and partly on knowledge gained from evidence presented in the Court. In consequence, the reasons upon which the original rule was founded gradually ceased to have any mean ing. And as a result of the two statutes of 16 and 17 Car. U, c. 8 (1664) and of 4 Anne, c. 16, § 6 (1705), the rule requiring the laying of Venue in the Body of the Plead - ing became an unmeaning form, the prac tice of alleging the Venue in the margin hay - Common Law, c.

However, in eases which required local de .scription, the Venue was still to be laid in the Body of the Declaration. 8 But the en forcement of this rule did not call for the statement of a correct Venue except when the Action was Local, and in Transitory Ac - tons the Venue could be laid in any county, subject to objection by the adverse party.° The Commencement WHAT is termed the Commencement of the Declaration precedes the Statement of the Cause of Action or Body of the Declaration. 4 Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading, e.

But what is a cause of action? Gould defined a cause of action as a set of “facts which entitles the plaintiff to the re lief claimed.”” Of course the essential ele ments of any claim of relief or remedial right will vary from action to action. But, on analysis, the pleader will find that the facts prescribed by the substantive law as necessary to constitute a cause of action in a given case, may be classified under three heads: (1) The plaintiff’s right or title; (2) The defendant’s wrongful act violating that right or title; (3) The consequent damage, whether nominal or substantial.

The Production of Suit THE Production of the plaintiff’s suit (secta), by which the plaintiff was required to present proof of his Declaration at once, and even before it was called into question upon the pleading, is an example of one of those instances, not infrequentl y noticeable in Common Law Pleading, where the form of an old procedure is retained, long after the reason for its existence has been swept away. Anciently, in the primitive period of Com mon Law Procedure when Pleadings were still made Orally, and Trial b y Battle and Ordeal was still in vogue, the plaintiff was required to produce his proof, or his sect a — that is, a suite or train of followers prepared to confirm his Allegations. Although the practice has long been discontinued, the orig inal formula ther e used to announce the plaintiff’s readiness still remains with us. In consequence, in all Common Law Actions it is still customary to conclude the Declara tion with the phrase “and thcrefore he brings his suit.” 14 13.

The Declaration must state distinctly and with certainty every fact that is essential to the plaintiff’s prima facie case. No Essen tial Allegations can be imported into the Dec laration by inference or intendment. The principal points to he shown in the statement of a cause of action are: (I) The plaintiff’s right; (II) The defendant’s wrongful act violat ing that right; (III) The consequent damages.

What is meant by this? 20 It is this: since every liability consist of two elements — a given combination of facts and events, plus a rule of substantive law attaching legal con sequences — it follows that a complete st ate ment of the entire right of action would in elude both the combination of facts and the rule of substantive Jaw relied upon. If these two elements are established, Judgment for the plaintiff will be entered. Such Judgment naturally follows from certain premises of fact and of law, which may be stated as fol - lows: (1) 2’~fajor Premise: The rule of law relied upon by the plaintiff — by rule of the Substan tive Law of real property, damages may be re covered against one who rides over my corn, or trespasses on my property: (2) Minor Premise: The combination of facts relied upon by the plaintiff — that the defendant has ridden over my corn; Conclusion: Therefore, the plaintiff right of action against de fendant in he may recover damages against the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Page 99 of 735 ID - “Every action is brought in order to obtain some particular result which is termed the remedy.

The Defendant’s Wrongful Act Violating That Right NO cause of action can arise unless some right of the plaintiff has been violated or in jured by the defendant, The injury as well as the right must, therefore, be alleged in the Declaration. Thus, in an Action for the Breach of a Contract, it is not only necessary to show the existence of the contract, bind ing the defendant to perform or fo rbear some act for the plaintiff, but it is also necessary to show that the defendant has violated some duty arising from the contract; that is, that the performance of the contract became due, and that he failed to perform it.

Lyon, 91 U.S. 225, 236, 23 where a wrong is shown, nominal damages may be recovered. The fact, however, that damage will be presumed in any given case, does not dispense with the necessity of an averment of damage in the Declaration. What is a Fact BUT when you have found that you must allege a right, a violation of that right and damages, as an incident of stating a cause of action, you have not as yet touched the prob lem as to what particular kind of facts must be alleged in order t o properly plead these so - called essentials of a good cause of action, a matter to which we may now address our selves. In order to frame a good declaration in which a good cause of action is stated, a pleader must consider first, what facts must be state d, and second, in what manner and form should such facts, whatever their char acter, be stated? And these inquiries raise the question as to what, then, is a fact. A fact may be said to be anything of which a past or present ex istence may be asserted. And, for purposes of legal analysis, there are ordinary facts and extraordinary facts of law, Ordinary facts may be separated into two groups, ulti mate and evidentiary facts, Ultimate Fact Defined AN ultimate fact 23 is any fact to which the substantive law attaches legal conse LEd. 305 (1876); so also in a private action for a public nuisance, Swain & Son v. Chicago 13. & 0. It. Co., 252 III. 622, 97 N.E. 247 (1911). And in Treusch v. Kamka, 83 Md. 274 (1885), where the Declaration alleged no Damages from negli gence, it was held fatal on Demurrer. 23 - In general, on what facts must be ailei~ed nt Com mon Law and under modern codes and Practice Acts, see Articles: Cook, Statement of Fact in Pleading Under the Codes, 21 CoI.Litev 418 (1921); Dowdall, Plead ing “Material Facts,” 77 U. of I’a.L.Ecv. 945 (1929); ‘Wheaton, Manner of Stating In Cause of Action, 20 Cornell L.Q. 185 (1935); Oavitt, Legal Conclusions, 16 MinnLRev. 378 (1932); Cook, “Facts” and 90 DECLARATION — FORM Cli. 4 quences. It sometimes may be inferred from the statement of a sufficiently large number of evidentiary facts. Thus, for example, if a plaintiff wants to institute an Action of Ejectment against a defendant, he must look to the Substantive Commo n Law governing real property to discover what Ailegations he must allege in his Declaration to state a good cause of action. There he discovers that he must allege Right or Title, Wrongful Act of Ejectment, and Damages. If, in draft ing his Declaration, t he plaintiff omits an Al — legation required by the Substantive Law, the defect is available on Demurrer at the Pleading Stage, on Motion in Arrest of Judg ment, after Verdict and before Judgment, and on Writ of Error, after Final Judgment, under the genera l principle that ordinarily a Substantive Defect, or a failure to state a material, or ultimate fact is always available at any stage of the proceedings. Evidentiary Fact Defined AN evidentiary fact is a fact to which the Substantive Law does not attach legal con sequences, but from which, if stated in suffi cient detail, an ultimate fact may sometimes be inferred. Thus, to illustrate, in the Ac tion of Ejectment referred to above, let us suppose that the plaintiff alleged, by way of title, that he had a “grant deed” of Black - acre. The Substantive Law of real property requires that in order for the plaintiff to state a good cause of action, he must allege that he owned, possessed, had an immediate right to possession, or was seized of Black - acre. As a “gra nt deed” of Blackacre is not title, but only evidence of title, the plaintiff’s Declaration is defective in having stated an evidentiary fact, whereas he should have al leged the ultimate fact that he was “seized” “Statements of Fact”, 4 U.Chi.L,Rev.

The Ultimate and Operative Facts should be pleaded, not Evidentiaty Facts and not Conclusions of Law. WITH these distinctions in mind, we are for the first time in a position to state the General Rule as to what facts must be stated in order to state a good cause of action. The General Common Law Rule is that the plain tiff, in order to state a good cause of action in his Declaration, must allege ultima te facts, and not evidentiary facts, and not Con clusions of Law)° 24. See McCaughcy v. Schuctte, 117 Cal. 223, 46 P. 666, 59 Am.St.Rep. 176 (1896). 25. See Camp & Bros. v. Hall, $9 Pla. 535, 568, 22 So. 792, 796 (1897), where it was contended that the Declaration alleged Evideatiary as opposed to Ulti mate Pacts, the CourtS in discussing the question as to whether stating Evidentiary Pacts was a defect in form or in substance, declared: “This latter con t eation Is no doubt true, but as the Evidentiary Facts alleged are sufficient, if true, to establish conclusively the Ultimate Pacts, the defect In this respect is one of form, and not one of substance. If the Evidentiary Facts alleged were Insufficient in Law to Establish the Ultimate Facts, the defect would he one of substance, proper to be reached by General Demurrer; but if the objection be simply to this manner of Pleading the Ultimate Facts, tbe defect is one of form, and could formerly be reached by S pecial Demurrer only.” See, also, on Evidentiary Facts, DeCordova v. San viille, 165 App.Div. 128, 150 N.Y.Supp. 709 (1914), reversed in 214 N.Y. 662, 108 N.E. 1092 (1915). 20. “The only question, then, Is whether the Com plaints, all of which are in sub stance as above stat ed, contain what is technically a Sufficient State ment of a Cause of Action. The Sufficiency of the Pleadings Is to be determined by the New York Code of Procedure. This requires a ‘plain and con cise Statement of the Facts constituti ng a Cause of Action,’ Section 43t But the Rule of Pleading at Common Law was the same, viz., that Facts, not mere Conclusions of Law, were to be stated.

See. 22 ULTIMATE M~1) EVIDENTIARY FACTS 91 The process of differentiating, in the con fused history of a case, the Ultimate or Om erative Facts from the probative and collat eral circumstances involved, is the first step in the diagnosis of the case, to discover whether the plaintiff has a right of action, and also for the intelligent statement of the cause of action in the Declarati on. Only the essential facts should be alleged which form the basis of the claim for relief. This ex cludes the details and particulars of evidence by which these fundamental points are to be established. Some observance of this dis tinction is necessary i f the pleadings are to make the issues clear, simple and certain. The subordinate facts, which make up the probative matter, the casual details and dra matic circumstances, may vary indefinitely, but the “Ultimate”, the “Material” or “Issu able” Facts cann ot be omitted without de stroying the plaintiff’s cause of action or the defendant’s Defense, as the case may be. As observed earlier, it is a well - settled Rule of Pleading that it is never necessary to set forth mere Matters of Evidence. 27 In other 27. English: rlowman’s Case. 9 Coke Ia, Tb, 77 Eng.

The rule under consideration is not noticed in Equity Pleading strictly, It being there often essential that the Facts which are the Subject of the Action, be stated in detail. Story, Commentaries on Equity Pleading, c. V ~ 265a, n. 1 (9th S. by Gould, Boston, 1879). But in Code Pleading the Rule is fully recognized. though not expressly prescribed; and, as the Codes retain but one form of action for both legal and non - legal remedies, the application of the Rule Is words, although a particul ar fact may be of the essence of a party’s cause of Action or Defense, so that a statement of it is indis pensable, it still is not necessary, in alleging it, to state such circumstances as merely tend to prove the tnath of the fact. The reason of the rul e is evident, if we re vert to the general object which all the rules, tending to certainty, contemplate, that is, the attainment of a certain issue. This implies, as has been shown, a development of the question in controversy in a specific shape; but so that that object be attained, there is, in general, no necessity for further minute ness in the pleading; and therefore, those subordinate facts, which go to make up the evidence by which the affirmative or nega tive of the issue is to be established, are not required to be alleged, and hence may be brought forward for the first time at the Trial, when the issue comes to be decided. The Ultimate or Operative Facts are the Facts required by the Substantive Law; it is these Facts which the party needs to est ab lish to win his case) 8 They must be facts, definite and concrete enough to direct atten - tion to the basis or ground of the plaintiff’s legal contentions. But at the same time, they must reduce the case to its essentials. For instance, if the pleader wis hes to allege that the railroad contracted to carry the plaintiff as a passenger on its train with his sometimes difficult. See Bliss, Law of Pleading Un der the Codes of Civil Procedure, e. XIII, Rules Governing the Statement, Rule V, Evidence Should Not be Pleaded, 323, 324 (34 ed. St. Paul 1894). 25. “For the Purpose of Pleading only the ‘Ultimate Fact to be proved need be stated. The circum stances whith tend to prove the Ultimate Fact can be used for Purposes of Evidence, but they have no place in th e Pleadings.” McAllister v. Kuhn, 90 U. 8. 87, 24 L.Ed. 615 (1877). See also, Steuben Coun ty Bank v. Mathewson, 5 Hill (Ni.) 249 (1843), It is the office of a pleading to allege the ultimate facts. Hence, a Deelaratlon that defendant negli gently allowed a fire to start on his own premises need not describe the start of the fire or other cir cumstance of its origin. Mabaffey v. 3. Ia.

And if the plaintiff wishes to set up that he is the owner of cer tain land, he should i - iot set forth the links in his chain of title, for, as we have seen, this is evidentiary matter; he should allege that he is seized of the land in question, as seisin is the Ultimate or Material Fact to which the law of real property attaches the legal consequences of ownership, which the plain - tiff is seeking to establish against the de fenthnt. ULTIM ATE FACTS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 23. The Averments in the plaintiff’s Dec laration or the defendant’s Defense should he of the Operative Facts, and not of mere Con clusions of Law from such Facts Often the distinction is one of the degree of particularity required in describing the particular matter or transaction involved. THE Averment of the Operative Facts, es sential to constitute a prima facic Cause of Action, must be Specific and set forth the Concrete Facts from which the Conclusions follow.

A s tate ment that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in a certain sum gives no facts to charge the defendant. In Common - Law Pleading, it is permitted under the Common Counts to state this Conclusion of Indebted ness, but it is accompanied by some gene ral statement of the ground of the debt. In re ferring to this tendency toward generality in Pleading, David Dudley Field said of the Common Counts: “They (the Courts and the Lawyers) made the rules and they defend them, as a means of eliciting the precise point of fact in dispute between the parties; and they contrive every means in their power to conceal it, under forms the most general and unmeaning that can be imagined.” a In stead of stating the concrete facts of the claim, a Common Count states only C onclu sions of Law, the mere Averment that the defendant is indebted for this or that.

It is not always easy to distinguish the de tails of evidence, on the one hand, and Con clusions of Law, on the other, from the op erative or Issuable Facts, upon which the right to relief depends.

Thus, the facts constituting fraud, are fre quently required to be alleged in compara tively detailed form,” ~ In many situations a single convenient term is employed to designate (generically) certain miscellaneous Operative Facts, such as ownership or possession, which is a meth od of stating their net force and effect in law, without alleging the specific circum s tances. It is sufficient to allege that the plaintiff is the owner of certain land or that he was possessed of certain chattels. 36 On the other hand, it would be a Conclusion of 31.

Since either promise is sufficient to sustain a de mand of payment, to allege both would be Double Pleading. So one sued for money may have several Defenses, such a Payment, Want or Failure of Consideration, the Stat ute of Limitations, a Discharge in Bank ruptcy; and one who is sued for nonperform ance of something to be done upon request might defend by showing that he was never requested and never refused to perform. In either of these cases, to set up in Defence more than one of the facts available to defeat the suit would constitute Duplicity.” 42 As the Common Law scheme of remedial ruling was designed to produce a single is sue, the determination of which would settle the litigation, Duplicity was regarded as a vice as it conduced to the Multiplication of Issues. Each cause of action and each De fence was required to be placed on one ground, which on Traverse or Plea in Con fession and Avoidance would leave only a single point in issue at any one stage of the pleading, and then ultimately develop a single c lear - cut Issue of Fact. Double Pleading was therefore prohibited to prevent a party arguing two or more matters from which a plurality of issues might develop. With this preliminary statement in mind, we may now consider the problem presented when Sev eral Counts are placed in the same Declara tion, a form of which appears below: 42.

Where a party had sev eral distinct causes of action, at Common Law, he was allowed to pursue them cumulatively in the same action, subject to several rules, to be present ly explained, as to joining such demands only as were of similar character or quality. Thus, he might join a claim of Debt on a Bond with a claim of Debt on a Simple Con tract, and pursue his remedy for both in the same Action of Debt. 43 So, if several distinct trespasses were committed, these might all form the subject of one Action in Trespass. 4 ’ 43. Trth,,~ Cotton Manufactory v. Lobdell, 13 Johns, (N.Y.) 482 (1810), in which the Court introduced the foliowlag test: “The Rule is"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Page 1 08 of 735 invariable, that Causes of Action, which admit of the Same Plea and the Same Judgment, may be Joined; but the ecaverse of thi s proposition is not invariably truo.” 44 - That dIfferent Acts of Negligence may be charged In different Counts as the Cause of Injury, see Scott 1 Where the plaintiff thus makes several de mands in the same action, he should set them out separately in hi s Declaration in what are called “Separate Counts.” Each Count is a separate, independent statement of a cause of action. Moreover, a plaintiff is permitted to state the same cause of action in different ways in different Counts, as if he were setting out so many separate and distinct causes of action. This was for the purpose of pre - venting the defeat of a just cause of action through an incidental Variance between the evidence produced at the Trial and the Al legations contained in the various Counts. In an effort to avoid such an occurrence, the same cause of action was stated in dif ferent Counts so as to meet any variation in the evidence which might develop at the Trial. The use of Several Counts was subject to the requirement t hat each Count must be •as complete and distinct in itself as if plead ed alone. The sufficiency of one of Several Counts was determined on its own Aver ments, without regard to the other Counts.’ 5 One Count, however, might make reference to another for re levant matter without the necessity of repeating it. The use of Several Counts when applied to distinct causes of action was entirely con sistent with the Rule Against Duplicity, as the object of that rule was to prevent several issues in respect to the s ame demand only, there being no objection to having several issues where the demands were several. v. Parlen & Orcndorff Co., 245 III. 460, 92 N.E. 318 (1910). And Several Acts of Negligence causing the Injury may be alleged in One Count of a Declaration as One Cause of Action. Flynn v.

Cli. 4 Where Several Counts were thus used, the defendant might, according to the nature of his Defense, Demur to the entire Declara tion, or plead a single Plea to the entire Declaration, or he might follow the course of Demurring to one Count and pleading to another, or he might plead a Separate Plea to each Count; and in the two lat ter cases the action may cause a co rres - ponding severance in the subsequent plead ing, and the production of several is sues. But, whether one or more issues be produced, if the decision, whether on Law or Fact, was in the plaintiff’s favor, as to any one or more Counts, he was entitled to Judgment pro tanto, even though he failed as to the remainder.” JOINDER OF DIFFERENT CAUSES OF ACTION 47 25.

St. Paul 1947). DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME CAUSE OF ACTION 26. Facts constituting but a single cause of action may be differently stated in Separate Counts, in the same Declaration, without flu. plicity. THE Rule here stated is the result of an ancient relaxation of the Rule against Du plicity, allowed where the nature of the facts upon which the plaintiff’s claim rests ren dered it doubtful whether a single statement might not fall to justify a recovery, either from insufficiency in Law, . or inability to properly support the claim by competent proof. The pleader is therefore permitted to include in his Declaration several statements of the same Cause of Action, each of which differently represen ts the same State of Facts, and upon one of which a Verdict may be obtained, though he fail as to the rest. He may thus insert as many Counts or State ments as he pleases, though there can be but one recovery of the sum claimed as due. This Rule, says Step hen, is a relaxation of very ancient date, and has long since passed, by continual sufferance, into allowable and regular practice. It takes place when the pleader, in drawing the Declaration in Any Action, after having set forth his case in one view, feel s doubtful whether, as so stated, it may not be insufficient in Point of Law, or in capable of proof in Point of Fact, and at the same time perceives another Mode of State ment by which the apprehended difficulty may probably be avoided. Not choosing to re ly on either view of the case exclusively, he takes the course of adopting both, and accordingly inserts the second form of state ment, in the shape of a second Count, in the same manner as if he were proceeding for a separate Cause of Action. If, upon the same principle, he wishes to vary still further the Method of Allegation, he may find it necessary to add many other succeeding Counts besides the second; and thus, in prac tice, a great Variety of Counts often occurs Sec. 26 DIFFERENT VERSIONS 99 in respect of the same Cause of Action, the Law not having set any limits to the dis cretion of the Pleader, in This respect, if fairly and rationally exercised.°’ Resort may be had to Several Counts in respect of the same Cause of Action, either where the S tate of Facts to which each Count refers is really different, or where the same State of Facts is differently represented. The first case may be illustrated by an Action of Debt on a Penal Bond whereby the defendant engaged to pay a certain penalty in the event of nonpayment of a sum of money on the 11th of June, and another sum on the 10th of July, and a certain sum every month after, till a certain sum was satisfied. Let it be supposed that the plaintiff com plains of a failure in payment both on the 11t h of June and 10th of July. Either failure entitles him to the penal sum for which he brings the action; but, if he states them both in the same Count, the Declaration will be double, The case, however, may be such as to make it convenient to rely on both defaults; for there may be a doubt whether one or other of the payments were not made, St Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions, c, H, Of the Principal Rules of Pleading, § 3, 258 (3d Am. ed. bY Tyler, Washington, D. C. 1892); Ward v. Bell, 2 DoWl. 76 (1833) (The Judge in the Trial Court compared different counts to safety valves); Newby v. Mason, 1 Dowl. & Ryland 508 (1822). See, also, Keigwin, Precedents in Pleading, Case xvii, 425 — 428 (Washington,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Page 112 of 735 1910); Jackson v. Baker, 24 App.D.C. 100 (1904). “The Multiplication of Counts has long been consid. ered one of the chief abuses in the System of plead ing. . . To allow the plaintiff or defendant to state his case in ten or fifteen different ways is a custom the reasonableness of which is not readily perceived.” The principal reason is the Strictness of the Rules as to Varlanee. Report of the Common Law Commissioners. On the “Licensed Duplicity of Plural counts” to meet (1) the uncertainties of evi dence in support of the plaintiff’s case; (2) to meet doubt as to the Law; (3) to obtain for the plaintiff the greatest possible latitude of proof. Note in Keig win, Precedents of PleadIng, 424, 426ff. A Count not varying substantially from a preceding Count Is objectionable for redundancy. Sowter v. seekonk Lace Ce., 34 Ri. 304, 83 A. 437 (1912). though it may be certain that there was at least one default; and if, under these c ir cumstances, the plaintiff should set forth one of the defaults, and the defendant should take issue upon it, he might defeat the action by proving payment on the day alleged, though he would have been unable to prove the other payment. To meet this diff iculty, the pleader might resort to two Counts. The first of these would set forth the penal bond, alleging a default of payment on the 11th of June; the second would again set forth the same bond, describing it as “a certain other bond,” etc., and would a llege a default on the 10th of July. The effect of this would be that the plaintiff, at the Trial, might rely on either default, as he might then find con venient. In this instance, the Several Counts are each founded on a different State of Facts, that is , a different default in payment, though in support of the same demand. But it more frequently happens that it is the same State of Facts differently repre sented which forms the subject of different Counts. Thus, where a man has ordered goods of another, and an action is brought against him for the price, the circumstances may be conceived to be such as to raise a doubt whether the transaction ought to be described as one of goods sold and delivered, or of work and labor done, and, in this case, there wou ld be two Counts, setting forth the claim both ways, in order to secure a Ver dict, at all events, upon one of them. The best illustration of the practice of thus re stating a Cause of Action in the same Decla ration is found in the use of the Common Count s in General Assumpsit, which appear in the chapter on the Action of Indebitatus As sumpsit. They eii~brace not only what are called the “Money Counts,” or those for mon ey transactions, but also include Counts for almost any State of Facts upon which a de bt may be founded. The Money Counts are those generally for money lent to the defend ant, had and received by him for the pla’mtiff, 100 DECLARATION — FORM Ch, 4 or paid out for him by the latter, for interest due, and for an account “stated” or agreed upon. The others may be, among other things, for work and labor, goods sold and de livered, use and occupation, etc. And first of all, preceding the Common Counts, there may be a Special Count declaring on an express contract. This is done because it often hap pens that, when the Special Counts are found incapable of proof at the Trial, the Cause of Action will resolve itself into one of these general pecuniary forms of demand, and thus the plaintiff may obtain a Verdict on one of these Money Counts, though he fail as to all the rest. Again, the same State of Facts may be varied by omitting in one Count some matter stated in another. In such a ease the More Special Count is used, lest the omission of this matter should render the other Insuffi cient in Poin t of Law. The More General Count is adopted, because, if good in Point of Law, it will relieve the plaintiff from the necessity of proving such omitted matter in Point of Fact. If the defendant Demurs to the latter Count as insufficient, and takes Issue in Fact on the former, the plaintiff has the chance of proving the matter alleged, and also the chance of succeeding on the Demurrer. It is to be observed that, whether the subjects of Several Counts be really distinct or identical, they must always purpo rt to be founded on distinct Causes of Action, and not to refer to the same matter; and this is effected by the insertion of such words as “other,” “the further sum”, etc. This is evidently rendered necessary by The Rule against Duplicity, which, though ev aded, as to The Declaration, by The use of Several Counts, in the manner here described, is not to be directly v1olated.~"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Page 113 of 735 St. Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions, c.

A con vincing proof of its force at the present day is that even in Code Pleading, though some writers claim that the principles applicable are derived entirely from the Practice Act itself, and not from the Common Law, the agreement between the Summons and Com plaint in most of the particulars hereafter mentioned is essen tial, and for the same rea son.

LAYING TRE VENUE 28. In all Pleadings, some certain pJace must be alleged for every affirmative Traversable Fact, which place is called the ‘Venue” of the action. The Venue in all actions is to be laid truly, or at the option of the pleader, according as the same are respectively: (I) Local, or (II) Transitory WITH each stage in the development of the Jury, the manner of laying Venue under went a change. During the first or earliest stage, the general rule was that each affirma tive Traversable Allegation in the Original Writ, arid also in the Declaration, which was required to Confo rm to the Writ in this as in other particulars, was to be laid with a Venue or place comprising, not only the county, but the specific place in the county in which the fact"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Page 115 of 735 occurred. The rule also applied to actions Commenced by Bill in stead of by Origina l Writ. And in both eases the Plea, Replication and Subsequent Pleadings were required to lay Venue to 102 Sec. 29 each affirmative Traversable Allegation. 1 This laying of the Venue in connection with each Traversable Allegation in the Body of the Declara tion or other pleading is designat ed as the Fact Venue. In the second stage of the Jury’s growth, and after the statute of 1705,2 the Jury was summoned from the county in which the ac tion was triable, whether or not the fact in issue occurred there. The statute of 16 & 17 Car. II, enacted in 1664,~ provided that a Judgment after Verdict should not be stayed or reversed on account of the Venue, if the cause were tried by a Jury of the county where the action was laid. According to Stephen, the pr actice of laying a Venue in the Body of the Pleadings became “an un meaning form, 4 the Venue in the margin hav ing been long found sufficient for all practi cal purposes.” ~ And by the Hilary Rules of 1834,° it was provided that “The name of a county shall in all cases be stated in the mar gin of a Declaration; and shall be taken to be the Venue intended by the plaintiff, and no Venue shall be stated in the Body of the Declaration, or in any Subsequent Pleading. Provided, that in cases where local descrip t ion is now required, such local description shall be given.” A Venue should be laid in the Declaration, but failure to lay any Venue in a Transitory Action is regarded merely as a formal defect, which can only be taken advantage of by 1.

In Massachusetts it was held that a Declaration in a Transitory Ac tion, without a Venue, or with a wrong one, is bad in form if Specially Demurred to for this cause; but that objection cannot be taken in any other way. 7 In most states it is not considered necessary, as formerly, in a Transitory Action, to lay every Trave rsable Fact affirmatively alleged with a Venue. It is sufficient if the name of the county ap pear in the margin, though it may not be alleged at all in the Body of the Declaration. 3 LOCAL AND TRANSITORY ACTIONS 9 29. A Local Action is one where the trans action upon which it is founded could only occur in a particular place, and may be either for: (I) The recovery of land; or (II) The establishment or maintenance of a right arising out of land, or the recovery of damages for its injury. Transitory Actions are those founded on transactions which might have taken place anywhere. THE law distinguishes between transac tions which might occur at any place and 7. Briggs v.

Causes of action which do not nec essarily arise in any specific place are Tran sitory, and may be brought in any juris diction in which the plaintiff succeeds in serving the defendant personally.’° Causes of action which necessarily involve a certain locality, such, for example, as an Action of Ejectment, are Local, and must be tried in the place where property involved is located. The distinction between Actions w hich are Local and hence must be brought in the jurisdiction where the property concerned is located, and Actions which are Transitory, and hence may be brought in any place where jurisdiction of the defendant may be obtain ed, is one which exerts an influ ence upon the laying of the Venue.

Sec. 29 105 106 THE DECLARATION — PLACE, TIME, TITLE Ch. 5 ‘I p. it may be laid at the option of the pleader, This depends, as we shall now see, on the question whether the action is Local or Transitory. And in this connection two situ ations will be considered: (1) Where the facts are of a Transitory character, that is, not associated with any partkcular locality, the facts may be stated as having occurred at one place and proved as occurring at any other. In other words the Venue does not have to be stated truly, as was the case where the jurors were Se lected because of their own peculiar knowl - edge of the facts in issue. In practice, how cver, it was always the better part of wisdom to Jay the Venue truly. But a Variance in respect to a Transitory Fact, unless it in volved a matter of description, 24 would not prove fatal. Thus, if A alleged that B as saulted him at a certain place, he might support his Allegation by Proof that the assault took place at any other place. And the defendant, in his Plea, was ordinarily required to follow the Venue of the Declara tion and could not specify another place for his Defense, even if that other place accorded with the truth. 25 But when the Defense depended for its validity upon its locality, and the place where it arose was not in ac cord with the place laid in t he Declaration, the defendant might state the actual place, where he could justify by way of a plea of special traverse. 26 (2) Where the cause of action was of a local nature, that is, where it concerned land, an action could not be supported in a juris d iction which did not include the subject matter — the land.

And if the land were untruly described as being in county X, when the fact appeared in Proof at the Trial that the land was located in another county, the action would be dismissed. And the same was true wher e the action was brought for a trespass upon land which was in fact located in a foreign state. 2~ Laying the Venue Under a Vidilicet Since place was not material in Transitory Actions, and the Venue could be laid in any county, even though the cause of ac tion arose within a foreign jurisdiction, a remedy was thus afforded, not only in one state or county, for an injury to personal property within the limits of another, or without the limits of the United States, but also for the Breach of any Contract, whe rever executed, anti even where relating to land. 2~ When the Cause of Action and the Action itself were thus Transitory in their character, the plain tiff, in laying the Venue, was permitted to depart as widely from the fact as he thought fit and as was ne cessary to give the court in which he sued jurisdiction, without caus ing a discrepancy between the Allegations in the Declaration and the proof at the trial. The usual way of accomplishing this was by stating truly the facts constituting the cause of acti on as occurring at the place where it really happened, and then laying the Venue under a videlicet, as within the jurisdiction of the court; thus it might be alleged that the deed was dated “at Fort St. George in the East Indies, to wit, at Westminster in the County of Middlesex,” 29 or that the 27.

Local Facts must always be truly laid, both in the Declaration and Subsequent Plead ings, whether the Action be Local or Transitory. And in Transitory Actions, where the defend ant pleads Transitory matters, the Venue must follow the Declaration, unless h is Defense re qufres a different statement. IT has been seen that in all Local Actions it is necessary to Aver all material facts as happening where they actually occurred, and the same is equally true as to the Allegation of all Local Facts in both the - Declaration and Subsequent Pleadings, whether the Ac tion be Local or Transitory. But in actions of the latter kind, where the Subsequent Pleadings ailege only matters Transitory in their nature, it is a rule that the Place of Trial laid in the Declaratio n draws to itself the Trial of all such matters. 32 The defend ant, therefore, in such cases, is obliged to follow the Venue that the plaintiff has laid, unless his Defense requires the Allegation of a different place; for, if allowed to deviate from this, without the necessity arising from a Defense founded upon Local Facts, he would be able to change or oust the Venue in Transitory Actions, and thus to subvert the rule allowing the plaintiff in such actions 30.

It would seem that the necessity of laying any Venue at all in proceedings subsequent to the Declaration would be obviated by this rule, and it has been so held; ~ but in prac tice it is still usual t o lay a Venue in these as well as in the Declaration, and, in point of form, is the proper course. CONSEQUENCES OF MISTAKE OR OMISSION 31. A mistake or omission in laying the Venue may be taken advantage of — (I) By Demurrer, where the defect is ap parent on the Face of the Declara tion (II) By Plea in Bar or Motion for Non - suit, where it is not. BY the ancient rule of the Common Law, a mistake in laying the Venue for Local Mat ters was ground for Nonsuit, by reason of misdescription of the subject matter of the suit, 34 and its omission, when necessary, an incurable defect, 35 But since the estab]ish ment of the distinction between Local and Transitory Actions, if the fault appears on the face of the Declaration, it will be good cause for Special Demu rrer; ~° and, if it does not so appear, it may be Pleaded in Bar of the Action, or taken advantage of at the Trial, by Motion for a Nonsuit on the ground of Variance. 3 ’ And in Transitory Actions, also, an omission of the Venue, if not De murred to, may be aided by any Plea which admits the fact for the Trial of which a prop - 33.

The rule ap plies, however, only when time is immaterial, and therefore, if the Defense is such as to render it necessary that the true time be stated in the Plea, the Law allows the de fendant to vary from the time mentioned in the Declaration. In all such cases the formal objection arising from the apparent discrep ancy in time between the Declaration and the Plea yields to the more important prin ciple that each party must be permitted to fra me his Allegations according to the exi gencies of his case. The principle is the same as laying the true Venue by the defend ant in Transitory Actions when the nature of his defense requires it. Again, the defendant is never required to follow the thy named in the Declaration in pleading Matter of Discharge, whether it be material or not, since all Matter of Discharge must, from its nature, have occurred subse quently to the creation of the duty or liabil ity upon which the action is foun ded. It is therefore clear that in such case the defend ant must state the Defense as having oc curred after the wrong was done or the con tract made; more especially if such Dis charge was by Matter of Record, or by a written instrument, since the time mu st then be laid to conform to the date of such Record or Instrument. TIME OF CONTINUING ACTS 35. When there is occasion to allege a conS tinuous act in pleading, the time of its dura tion should be shown, THIS rule applies generally where there is only one Count in the Declaration, and the subject matter of the suit consists of a continuing act by the defendant, covering many days. Here the act or acts should be alleged to have been committed on a given day and “on divers other days and times” between th at and another day or the time of the commencement of the suit, and the plain - Sec. 36 DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY 111 tiff will be allowed to offer evidence only in proof of acts committed during the whole or some part of the period covered. 53"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Page 124 of 735 DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY 36. When the Declaration alleges an injury to goods or chattels, or a contract relating tu them, their quantity, quality and value or price should be stated; and in actions for the re covery of, or for injuries to, real property, q uantity and quality should be shown. IT is, in general, necessary, where the Dec laration alleges any injury to goods and chat tels, or any contract relating to them, that their quality, quantity, and value or price should be stated. And in any action bro ught for recovery of real property, its quality should be shown, as whether it consists of houses, lands, or other hereditaments; and in general it should be stated whether the lands be meadow, pasture, or arable, etc. And the quantity of the lands or othe r real estate must also be specified. So, in an ac tion brought for injuries to real property, the quality should be shown, as whether it consists of houses, lands, or other heredita ments,M Thus, in an Action of Trespass for breaking the plaintiff’s close and taking away his fish, without showing the number or nature of the fish, it was, after Verdict, objected, in Arrest of Judgment — First, “that it did not appear by the Declaration of ~3.

Up on “Not Guilty” pleaded, the plaintiff had a Verdict, and it was moved in Arrest of Judg ment that the Declaration was ill, because the quantity and quality of the lands were not distinguished and ascertained, so as to show how ma ny acres of arable there were and how many of pasture.

Thus, a Dec laration in Trover for two packs of flax and two packs of hemp, without setting out the weight or quantity of a pack, is good after Verdict, and, as it seems, even upon Special Demurrer. 6 ’ So, a Declaration in Trover, for a library of books, has been allowed, without expressing what they were. So, where the plaintiff declared in Trespass for entering his house, and taking several keys for the opening of the doors of his said house, it was objecte d, after Verdict, that the kind and number ought to be ascertained. But it was answered and resolved that the keys are sufficiently ascertained by reference to the house 62 So it was held, upon Special De murrer, that it was sufficient to declare, in Trespass for breaking and entering a house, damaging the goods and chattels, and wrenching and forcing open the doors, with out specifying the goods and chattels, or the number of doors forced open; for that th e essential matter of the action was the break ing and entering of the house, and the rest merely Aggravation. 63 The degree of cer tainty requisite in stating matters of the kind mentioned seems to be such as the facts in 61.

For example, to a Declaration in Assumpsit for £10 4s., and other sums, the defendant pleaded, as to all but £4 is. 6d., the General Issue, and, as to the £4 7s. 6d., a tender. The plaintiff re plied that, after the cause of ac tion accrued, and before the tender, the plaintiff demand ed the said sum of £4 7s. 6d., which the de fendant refused to pay; and on issue joined it was proved that the plaintiff had demand ed not £4 7s. 6d., but the whole £10 4s.

The pleadings must specify the names of persons.

Persons Other than Parties TIlTS rule calls for strict accuracy in de scribing persons whose names are necessar ily mentioned in the statement of the Cause of Action or Defense, though they are in no sense concerned in bringing or defending the action; and the reason is that any error in descr ibing such persons may result in a fatal Variance when the Proof is reached, since the correct identification of such persons by name becomes a matter of essential descrip tion, material to the merits of the case.” If, in pleading a contract made by James Smith, the name is incorrectly given as John Smith, the strict rule would subject the pleader in fault to the penalty of a variance, though a more liberal practice now general ly allows an Amendment where it does not substantially change the cause of actio n. 67.

A person may be described by the name by which he is commonly known, though it is not his true name, and if a man has initials for his Chris tian name, or is in the habit of using initials therefor, and is known by t hem, they may be used in describing him. 7 ’ In a few states a middle name or initial is recognized by the law as a part of the name, and its omission, or a mistake in stating it, is a misnomer in the case of a party, and a Variance in the case of persons wh o are not parties, but are necessarily named.’ 2 In most Jurisdictions, however, the law recognizes but one Chris tian name, The middle name or initial is no part of the name, and need not be stated, or proved, if stated.’ 3 Where the name of a person is mis spelled, this will not constitute a Variance, nor a Misnomer, if the name as given and the name as proved are idem so nans, 51 Whether names are idem sonans or 71.

We shall first consider the case of a party’s alleging Title in himself, or in another whose authority he pleads; next that of his alleging it in his adversary. The exception to this rule in cases where the opposite party is estopped from denying Title will be presently considered. TITLE IN THE PARTY OR IN ONE WHOSE AUTHORITY HE PLEADS 40. ‘Whe n Title is alleged in the party him self, or in one whose authority he pleads, a Title to the subject matter of the controversy must generally be set forth in the pleadings in its full and precise extent. To this rule there are two exceptions: (I) When the action is founded on pos session only, and not on Title or Ownership, it is sufficient to allege a Title of Possession only, a naked Allegation of Possession being suffi cient. This applies to Personal Actions only. (II) In some cases, where a Title of Pos session is inapplicable, a general Freehold Title may be alleged in lieu of stating Title in its full and precise extent. Alleging Title of Possession IT is often sufficient to allege a Title of Possession only. Th e form of laying a Title of Possession, in respect of goods and chat tels, is either to allege that they were the “goods and chattels of the plaintiff,” or that he was “lawfully possessed of them as of his own property.” With respect to corporeal hereditaments, the form is either to allege that the close, etc., was the “close of” the plaintiff, or that he was “lawfully possessed of a certain close,” etc. With respect to in corporeal hereditaments, a Title of Posses sion is generally laid by allegin g that the plaintiff was possessed of the corporeal thing appurtenant to which is the right claimed, and by reason thereof was entitled to the right at the time in question; for example, that he “was possessed of a certain mes suage,” etc., “and by reason thereof, during all the time aforesaid, of right ought to have had common of pasture,” etc."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Page 130 of 735 A Title of Possession is applicable_that is, will be sufficiently sustained by the proof — in all cases where the interest is of a pres ent and immediate kind. Thus , when a Title of Possession is alleged with respect to goods and chattels, the statement will be supported by proof of any kind of present interest in them, whether that interest be temporary and special, or absolute, in its nature; as, for example, wheth er it be that of a carrier or finder, only, or that of an owner and pro prietor.’ 7 So, where a Title in Possession is alleged in respect to corporeal or incorporeal hereditaments, it will be sufficiently main tained by proving any kind of estate in pos - ses sion, whether fee simple, fee tail, for life, for term of years, or otherwise. On the other hand, with respect to any kind of property, a Title of Possession would not be sustained in evidence by proof of an interest in remainder or reversion only; and the refore, when the interest is of that description, the preceding forms are inapplicable, and Title must be laid in remainder or reversion, according to the fact, and upon the principles that will be afterwards stated, on the subject of al leging Title in it s full and precise extent. Where a Title of Possession is applicable, the Allegation of it is, in many cases, suffi cient, in pleading, without showing Title of a Superior kind, The rule on this subject is as follows; That it is sufficient to allege posse ssion as against a wrongdoer,” or in 87.

Under the head of “Allegation of Title,” In its full and precise extent, we shall con sider the statement of the Derivation of the Title, and then certain general rules as to the Allegation of the Titles themselves. In general it is sufficient to state a seisin In fee simple per se; that is, simply to state, according to the usual form of alleging that Title, that the party was “seized in his de mesne as of fee of and in a certain messuage,” etc., without showing the derivation, or, as it is expressed in pleading, the commencement of the estate; 98 for, if it were requisite to show from who m the present tenant derived his Title, it might be required, on the same principle, to show from whom that person de rived his, and so ad infinitum. Besides, as mere seisin will be sufficient to give an es tate in fee simple, the estate may, for any thing that appears, have had no other com mencement than the seisin itself which is al leged. Even though the fee be conditional or determinable on a certain event, yet a seisin in fee may be alleged, without show ing the commencement of the estate. 99 To this rule, however, there is this ex ception: It is necessary to show the deriva tion of the fee, where, in the pleading, the seisin has already been alleged in another person, from whom the present party claims. In such case it must, of course, be shown bow it passed from one of these persons to the other. Thus, in Debt or Covenant brought on an indenture of lease by the heir of the lessor, the plaintiff, having al fl. Scavnge V.

In pleading a Particular Estate, its com mencement must he shown, except where Title is alleged only as Inducement. WITH respect to particular estates, the general rule is that the commencement of Particular Estates must be shown. 3 The meaning of this rule is that, when a party sets up in his own favor an estate for life, a term of years, or a tenancy at will, he must show the Derivation of that Title from its commencement — that is, from the last seisin in fee simple; and, if derived by aliena tion or c onveyance, the substance and effect of such conveyances should be precisely set forth.

Hence, where title to particular estates is thus alleged, the time and manner of the derivation must be shown, in order that a Traverse may be taken upon any particular point in the Title. To the rule that the Commencement of a Particular Estate must be shown there is this exception, namely, that it need not be shown where Title is alleged by way of Inducement only. Thus, in an Action of Debt or Cove nant, brought on an indenture of lease by the executor or assignee of a lessor for a term of years, it is necessary, in the Declara tion, to state the Title of the lessor in order to show the plaintiff’s right to sue as as signee or executor; but, as the Title is thus alleged only by way of Inducement, the Par ticular Estate for years may be alleged in the lessor, without showing its commence ment. 4 TITLE BY INHERITANCE 43. Where a party claims by inheritance, he must, in general, show how he is the heir; and if he claims by mediate, and not immediate, descent, he must show the pedigree. THUS, in pleading his Title by inheritance, a party must in general show how he became the heir, that is, by showing the seizin and death of the ancestor, af ter whose decease the title descended to the plaintiff as son and heir; and if he claim by mediate descent 4. 5 Comyn’s Digest, ‘Pleader,” E. 19, C. 43 (Dublin 1793); Blockley v.

Frye, Croiac. 52, 79 Eng.Rep. 43. he must allege and prove the pedigree.~ Thus, in Heard v. Bask ervile,° where the plaintiff brought Replevin, it was pleaded that the rent descended to a cousin and heir, etc., without showing how the cousin became heir, and the plaintiff Demurred Generally, thus raising an issue of law as to whether the fail ure to set down the matter of cousenage con stituted a Defect of Substance, or of Form, such as by the Statute of Demurrers, 27 Eliz. c. 5, § 1"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Page 132 of 735 (1285), ought to be particularly set down, or else no advantage be taken of it. It was held that the descent, be ing mediate, should have been set forth, but that the fail ure to do so constituted a Defect in Form, and hence was waived by the General Demurrer, as provided by the Statute; the defect, in oth er words, would have been available upon Special Demurrer. • TITLE BY ALIENATION OR CONVEYANCE 44. When a party claims title by conveyance or alienation, the nature of the conveyance or alienation must, in general, be stated. WHERE a party relies upon title by con veyance or alienation, he must allege or set fort h the nature of the conveyance or aliena tion in his pleading, as whether it be devise, feoffment, or some other form of transfer. 7 MANNER OF PLEADING CONVEYANCE 45. The nature of the conveyance or aliena tion should be stated according to its Legal Effect, rather than its form of words. THIS rule involves a specific application of the general rule that in suing upon written contracts or documents they are to be alleged or set forth according to their Lega l Effect or Operation, and not Verbatim.

Sec. 46 STATUTE OF FRAUDS 121 the manner of pleading conveyances this doc trine means that in their pleading they must be alleged according to the extent of the Title which they actually pass. Thus, in pleading a conveyance for life, it must be al leged as a “demise” for life; or a conveyance in tail, with a livery of seizin, as a gift in tail; ° and a conveyance of the fee, with livery, is described by the term “ enfeoffed.” 10 And the form of pleading must still be the same, whatever might be the words of donation used in the instrument of conveyance, if the effect of the latter remains unchanged.” THE WRITTEN CONVEYANCE AND THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS 46. In pleading Title by Conveyance, if the nature of the conveyance is such that it would, at Common Law, be valid without a deed or other written instrument, then no deed or writ ing need be alleged in the pleading, even though such document may in fact exis t. But where the nature of the conveyance requires, at Common Law, a deed or other written in strument, such instrument must be alleged. There are two exceptions to this rule: (I) Where Title is pleaded under a writ ten lease for years; and (II) Where a D emise by husband and wife is pleaded. The Rule Where the Conveyance was Valid at Common Law AT Common Law, a conveyance in fee, in tall, or for life, when accompanied by livery of seisin, could be made by parol only, and was therefore pleaded without the Allegation of any charter or other writing, whether such instrument in fact accompanied the con veyance or not, as such a conveyance might, S.

With respect to livery and feofment It has been stated that ‘wlthout livery it Is no feofment, gift, or demise”. vyniar’s Case, S Co.Eep. Sib, 82b, 77 Eng.Rep. 597, 600 (1609). at Common Law, be made by parol only.” And though, by the Statute of Frauds,’ 3 such a conveyance will not now be valid unless made in writing, the form of the pleading nevertheless remains the same as before the enactment of the Statute in 1676. The rea son for this is that the Statute of Frauds merely introduces a new rule of eviden ce but does not alter or affect the rule of pleading. The Rule Where the Conveyance was Only Authorized by Statute CONTRARY to the Common - Law Rule where the conveyance was valid even though by parol, where a devise of land was involved, which, at Common L aw, was not valid, and which was authorized by the first Statute of Wills, in 154O,’~ and the second Statute of Wills in 1542,’~ it was required to be alleged to have been made in writing, as that was the only form in which the Statute authorized it to be made.’° And so, if a conveyance by way of grant be pleaded, a deed must be al leged, 17 for matters that “lie in grant” can pass by deed only. 18 Two Exceptions to the Common - Law Rule THE first exception to the rule that if the nature of a conveyance is such that it would, 12. The rule is the same as applied to ordinary con tracts. Thus, in Whitehead v. Burgess, 61 N.J.L. 75, 38 AtI. 802 (1897), Van Syckel, J., declared: “Where an action is foun ded upon a contract which at Com mon Law is valid without writing, but which the Statute requires to be In writing, the Declaration need not Count upon or take notice of the writing. If an action is brought upon a promise to pay the debt of another, the De claration need not aver that the promise is in writing, even if such be the fact.” See, also, Elting V. Vanderlyn, 4 Johns.

Grants ((La.). 122 THE DECLARATION — PLACE, TIME, TITLE Ch. 5 at Common Law, be valid without a deed or other written instrument, it need not be al leged in the pleading, is one which exists in practice, at least. Thus, in making title un der a lease for years, by indenture, it is mis - ternary to plead the indenture, though the lease was good, at Common Law, by parol, and need now be in writing only where it is for a term of more than three years, and then only by reason of the Statute of Frauds? 9 The second exception involves a case in which it is not necessary to allege a deed, though the Common Law requires one. Thus, in pleading a Demise by husband and wife, it is not necessary to show that it was by deed, though both by the Common Law and by Statute such a Demise could be by deed only. 29 WHERE A PARTY ALLEGES TITLE IN HIS ADVERSARY 47. It is not generally necessary to allege Title in the opposing party more precisely than Is sufficient to show a liability in the party charged, or to defeat his present claim. THUS far we have been discussing the case of a party alleging Title in himself or in some other under whose authority he pleads. It remains for us to consider the case of a par ty’s alleging Title in his adversary. The rule on this subject is that it is no t necessary to allege Title more precisely than is sufficient to show a liability in the party"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Page 134 of 735 charged, or to defeat his present claim. Except as far as these objects require, a party cannot be com pelled to show the precise estate his adver sary holds, ev en in a case where, if the same person were pleading his own Title, a full and complete statement would be necessary. The reason for the difference is that a party must be presumed to be ignorant of the particulars 19. %ee the example, 2 Chitty, on Pleading, c. Xi, 540 (5th ed., London, 1831). SO. Wiseot’s Case, 2 Co. 61b, 76 Eng.Rep. 558 (1590); Turney v. Sturges, 1 Dyer 91b, 73 Eng.Rep. 198; Bateman v. Allen, Cro.Eliz. 435, 78 Eng.Rep. 678; ChiMes v. Wescot, Cro.Eliz, 482, 78 Eng.Rep. 733. of his adversary’s Title, though he is bound to know his own. 2 ’ WHAT IS A SUFFICIENT ALLEGATION OF LIABILITY 48. To show a liability in the party charged, it is generally sufficient to allege a Title of P ossession. AS in the case where a party pleads his own Title or that of another through whom he claims, and that Title need not be fully and precisely stated, it is also generally suffi cient, where the opposite party is to be charged with liability, to a llege merely a Title of Possession in such party. The same distinctions as to the nature of the interest or right, however, are still to be observed; and therefore, if the interest is by way of re version or remainder, and cannot be sustained by proof of s ome present interest in chattels or the actual possession of land, this form of pleading Title is inapplicable. There are cases in which, to charge a party with mere possession, would not be sufficient to show his liability. Thus, in declaring against a pe rson in Debt for Rent, as assignee of a term of years, it would not be sufficient to show that he was possessed, but it must be shown that he was possessed as assignee of the term. Where a Title of Possession is thus inapplicable or insufficient, and some other or superior Title must be shown, it is still unnecessary to allege the Title of an adversary with the same precision and ac curacy as where the party states his own, 22 the requirement being only that the Allega tion shall be sufficient to show the li ability charged. Therefore, though, as we have seen, it is the rule, with respect to a man’s 21. Rider v. Smith, 3 T.R. 760, 100 Eng.Bep. 847 (1790); Derisley v, Custance, 4 PIt. 77, 100 Eng.

Sec. 49 PROOF OF TITLE AS ALLEGED 123 own Title, that the commencement of Par ticular Estates should be shown, unless al leged by way of Inducement, yet, in pleading the Title of an adversary, it seems that this is, in general, not necessary. 23 So, in cases where it happens to be requisite to show whence the adversary derived his Title, this may be done with less precision than where a man alleges his own. And, in general, it is sufficient to plead such Title by a que estate; that is, to allege that the opposite party has the same estate, or th at the same estate is vested in him, as has been prece dently laid in some other person, with out showing in what manner the estate passed from the one to the other. 24 Thus, in Debt, where the defendant is charged for rent, as assignee of the term, after s everal mesne assignments, it is sufficient, after stat ing the original demise, to allege that, “after making the said indenture, and during the term thereby granted, to wit, on the dayof ,intheyear ,at ______ all the estate and interest of the said E.F. [the originai lessee] of and in the said demised premises, by assignment, came to and vested in the said C.D.”; without fur ther showing the nature of the mesne assign ments. 26 But, if the case be reversed, that is, if the plaintiff, claiming as assignee o f the reversion, sue the lessee for rent, he must precisely show the conveyances, or other media of Title, by which he became entitled to the reversion; and to say, generally, that it came by assignment, will not, in this case, be sufficient, without circu mstantially alleg"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Page 135 of 735 23.

PROOF OF TITLE AS ALLEGED 49. Title is ordinarily of the substance of the issue, and must be strictly proved. THE manner of showing title, both where it is laid in the party himself, or the person whose authority he pleads, and where it is laid in his adversary, having been now co n sidered, it may next be observed that the title so shown must, in general, when issue is taken upon it, be strictly proved. With respect to the Allegations of place, time, quantity, and value, it has been seen that, when issue is taken upon them, they, i n most cases, do not require to be proved as laid; at least, if laid under a videlicet. But with respect to title, it is, ordinarily, of the Substance of the Issue, and there fore, required to be maintained accurately by the proof. Thus, in an action on th e Case, the plaintiff alleged in his Declaration that he demised a house to the defend ant for seven years, and that, during the term, the defendant so negligently kept his fire that the house was burned down. And the defendant having pleaded ncm denzisit modo et forma, it appeared in evidence that the plaintiff had demised to the defend ant several tenements, of which the house in question *as one; but that, with respect to this house, it was, by an exception in the 20.

Stephenson, 1 Salk. 355, 91 Eng.Rep. 310 (1703). 124 THE DECLARATION — PLACE, TIME, TITLE Cli. 5 lease, demised at will only. The Court held that though the plaintiff might have declared against the defendant as tenant at will only, and the action would have lain, yet, having stated a demise for seven years, the proof of a lease at will was a Variance , and that in substance, not in form only; and, on the ground of such Variance, Judgment was giv en for the defendant. 28 ESTOPPEL OP ADVERSE PARTY 50, Where the opposite party is estopped from denying a Title, none need be shown. THE rule which requires that Title should be shown having been now explained, it will be proper to notice an exception to which it is subject. This exception is that no Title need be shown where the opposite party is estopped from denying the title. Thus, in an action for goods sold and delivered, it is unnecessary, in addition to the allegation that the plaintiff sold and delivered them to the defendant, to state that they were the goods of the plaintiff; for a buyer who has accepted and enjoyed the goods cannot dis pute the Tit le of the seller. So, in debt or covenant brought by the lessor against the lessee on the covenants of the lease, the plaintiff need allege no Title to the premises demised, because a tenant is estopped from denying his landlord’s Title, On the other hand, however, a tenant is not bound to admit Title to any extent greater than might au thorize the lease; and therefore, if the ac tion be brought, not by the lessor himself, but by his heir, executor, or other repre sentative or assignee, the title of the for mer must be alleged, in"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Page 136 of 735 order to show that the reversion is now legally vested in the plain tiff in the character in which he sues.

See, also, Bristow v. Wright, 2 Doug. 665, 99 Eng. Rep. 421 (1781). and, unless he was so, the plaintiff cannot claim as heir. 29 SHOWING AS TO AUTHORITY 51. In general, where a defendant justifies under a writ, warrant, precept, or other au thority, it must be particulary set forth in his pleading; and in such case he should also show that such authority had been substantial ly pursued. Exception — Where an author ity may be ver bal and general, it may be pleaded in general terms. THIS is an instance, under the general rule requiring certainty in the pleadings, where a greater degree is required in the Plea than in the Declaration. Where in an Action of Trespass, t he defendant seeks to Plead a Justification under such an au thority as is mentioned above, he must set it forth particularly in his pleading, and it is not sufficient to Allege Generally that he committed the act complained of by virtue of a writ, warrant , or precept de livered to him. 3 ° It must not only be spe cifically described, but the defendant, in order to render his Justification complete, should further aver that such authority was substantially pursued. The principle of the rule is that as a Plea in Bar, to be effective, must answer all that it assumes to answer, so all material Allegations which make up the answer it contains must be fully and particularly stated, or the Plea will be de fective on Demurrer, 3 ’ In all cases, there fore, where the de fendant justifies under ju dicial process, he must set forth the facts in detail, though there are important distinc tions as to the degree of particularity re 29.

This rule applies only at Common Law, being one re lating to purely formal Allegations in Pleading.

So much only is stated as is material to the purpose, of which the example last cited will also serve for illustratioa. The other party, how ever, may reasonably desire to hear the whole, and this either for the purpose of enabling him to as certain the genuineness of the allege d deed, or of founding on some part of its contents, not set forth by the adverse pleader, some matter of answer. He Is therefore allowed this privilege of hearing the deed read verbatim.” Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions, c, I, Of the was done by actually producing the deed in Court at the time of the Oral Allegations, but it is now done by an Allegation in the Dec laration or Plea, as the case may be, of its production in court, — thus: “By his certain writing obligatory, s ealed with his seal, and now shown to the Court,” etc. 44 A failure to comply with this rule renders the Declara tion or Plea demurrable. WRITINGS PLEADED ACCORDING TO LEGAL EFFECT 53. Contracts and conveyances are to be pleaded according to their legal e ffect or op eration. As an instrument or other matter al leged in pleading must principally and ul timately be considered with reference to its effect in law, it should therefore be stated ac cording to its Legal Effect or operation and not according to it s terms. The pleader is ordinarily allowed to set up the instrument in its very words, if he prefers not to construe its Legal Effect. CONTRACTS and conveyances are to be pleaded according to their legal effect or op eration. 45 The meaning of the rule is that, Proceedings in an Action, From Its Commencement to Its Termination, 100 (3d Am. ed. by Tyler, Wash’ ington, D.

Thus, if a joint tenant conveys to his companion by the Words “gives,” “grants,” etc, his estate in the lands holden i n jointure, this, though in its terms a “grant,” is not properly such in operation of law, but amounts to that species of convey ance called a “release.” It should therefore be pleaded, not that he “granted,” etc., but that he"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Page 139 of 735 “released,” etc. 4 ° So, if a t enant for life grant his estate to him in reversion, this is, in effect, a surrender, and must be pleaded as such, and not as a grant. 47 So, where the Plea stated that A was entitled to an equity of redemption, and, subject thereto, that B Was seised in fe e, and that they, by lease and re - lease, granted, etc., the premises, ex cepting and reserving to A and his heirs, etc., a liberty of hunting, etc., it was held upon General Demurrer, and afterwards upon Writ of Error, that as A had no legal interest in th e land, there could be no reservation to him; that the Plea, therefore, alleging the right, though in terms of the deed, by way of reservation, was bad; and that if, as was contended in argument, the deed would op erate as a grant of the right, the Plea sh ould have been so pleaded, and should have al leged a grant, and not a reservation. 48 Cook, 77 WVa. 356, 87 3.11. 454, LB.A,1916D, 220 (1910); Wisconsin: Grannis v.

While the party must state correctly the contract or instrument on which he relies) and, if the evidence differ from the state ment, the whole foundation of his action will fail, he is not compelled to follow the precise form of words in either, and it suf fices if he alleges their true legal effect or operation. The rule is thus one of utility, since it en ables a party to state his matter briefly and With precision, without setting out the terms of contracts or instruments which often, even in modern conve yancing, reach an in terminable length, and to support his allega tions by the offer of the contract or instru ment itself at the trial. A deed may often be thus pleaded Without using a word which ft contains, except the names of the parties, the dates, an d the sums. 49 In all cases, care must be taken that the legal effect of the contract or instrument is accurately stated, or the result will be the same as if the state ment of either in detail is incorrect; that is, a Variance. The rule in question is, in its terms, often confined to deeds and conveyances. It ex tends, however, to all instruments in writ ing, and contracts, written or verbal; and, indeed, it may be said, generally, to all mat ters or transactions whatever which a party may have occasion to allege in pleading, and in which the form is distinguishable from the legal effect.M Where, however, a written instrument is set out in hace verbcz) it will be sufficient, and the pleader need not de dare further its Legal Effect, as the Court will constr ue it for him.

We have above seen that in every Personal or Mixed Action the Declaration should allege some damage, and this rule ha s never been changed, though its force in cases where damages are merely nominal seems rather doubtful. The method of applying the rule is as applicable today as at any former time, and the establishment of Code Practice has made no difference; the distinction above noted being always observ ed, as the pleader will find to his cost if it be disregarded. This distinction is an im portant one, as it arbitrarily controls the manner in which the claim for Damages must be stated. When the damage claimed is the necessary and proximate consequence of the act com plained of, the law presumes it to have re sulted from that act, and it is sufficient to describe it in general terms, for the reason that the opposite party will not be undu ly taken by surprise. 5 ’ But, when the plaintiff suffers some peculiar or unusual loss it is essential that the resulting Damage, called “Special Damages,” be shown with particu larity.~~ Such Damages are either super - added to General Damages arising from a n act injurious in itself, as when some particu lar loss results from the utterance of slan derous words actionable in themselves, or such as arise from an act indifferent, and not actionable in itself, but injurious only in its consequences, as when words become ac tionable only by reason of the Special Dam age ensuing. 59 57.

In general, whatever is alleged in Plead - Mg must be alleged with Certainty, Definite ness and Precision. A clear, distinct, and com plete Statement of the Facts which constitute the plaintiff’s Cause of Action or the defend ant’s Ground of Defense must be made in all Pleadings, in order that due notice may be given to the Adverse Party, and that a Definite and Certain Issue may be produced for decision. Where, however, the Facts lay within the knowl edge of the defendant, and where no other method was possible, General Allegations were permitted. THE Concept of Certainty in Pleading in cludes both p articularity and precision. It consists in alleging the Facts necessary so distinctly and explicitly as to show the legal basis of the Right or Defense asserted, give notice to the Adverse Party of what he is called upon to answer, and produce single, clea r - cut, well - defined Issues of Fact or of Law for decision.6 The varying amount of particularity required has given rise to at tempts to define the different Degrees of Certainty. The classic division proclaimed by Lord Coke, however, does not convey any in telligible idea of the distinctions recognized by the law. Under Coke’s Classification,’ there are three Degrees of Certainty, namely: (1) 5. Supra, note 1. 0. English: Wiatt v - Es~ington, 2 Ldilavm. 1411, 92 Eng.Eep. 418 (1725); Bertie v.

In Modern Times, it comes down to little more than this, that in Certain Disfavored Actions, such as Actions for Defamation; and in Certain Disfavored Defenses, such as Dilatory Pleas, more Facts must be alleged to make out a prima facie case or to repel hostile construction than in ordinary cases. Illwstrat ions IN Pleading the Performance of a Condi tion or Covenant, it is a Rule, though open to exceptions that will be presently noticed, that the Party must not Plead Generally that he performed the Covenant or Condition; but must show specially the Time, Place, and Manner of Performance; and, even though the subject to be performed should consist of several different ac ts, yet he must show in this special way the Performance of each.’ 5 Yet this Rule, requiring Performance to be specially shown, admits of relaxation where the subject comprehends such multiplicity of matter as would lead to great prolixity; and a More Gen eral Mode of Allegation is in such cases allowable. When in any of these excepted cases, how ever, a General Plea of Performance is Plead ed, the Rule under discussion still requires the plaintiff to show Particularly in his Rep SE, 843 (i912~ Taylor v. Ne w Jersey Title Guaran - tee & ‘tnst Co., 70 N.J.L. 24, 56 A. 152 (1903) in which It was held that circumstantial details were not necessary. llcation in what way the Covenant or Con dition has been broken; for otherwise no sufficiently certain Issue would be attained. Thus, in an Action of Debt on a Bond condi tioned for Performance of Affirmative and Absolute Covenants contained in a certain indenture, if the defendant Pleads Generally (as in that case he may) that he Performed the Covenants according to the Condition, the plaintiff cannot in his Replication Ten der Issue with a mere Traverse of the words of the Plea, viz., that the defendant did not Perform any of the Covenants, etc.; for this Issue would be too wide and uncertain. But he must Assign a Breac h, showing spe cifically in what particular, and in what man ner, the Covenants have been broken. 1 ° In an Action of Debt on a Bond conditioned to pay so much money yearly while certain letters patent were in force, the defendant Pleaded that from such a t ime to such a time he did pay, and that then the letters patent became void and of no force. The plaintiff having Replied, it was adjudged, on Demur rer to the Replication, that the Plea was bad, because it did not show how the letters patent became void. 2 0 With respect to all points on which Cer tainty of Allegation is required, it may be remarked, in general, that the Allegation, when brought into Issue, is required to be proved, in substance, as laid; and that the relaxation from the ordinary Rule on this subject which is allowed with respect to Place, Time, Quantity, and Value, does not, generally speaking, extend to other particu lai~. 10.

A General Mode of Pleading is allowed when great prolixity is thereby avoided. And a Statement of Mater ial Facts in a Pleading with unnecessary particularity, where a brief and Concise Allegation would be sufficient, not only tends to cause prolixity and confusion, but may subject the Party thus Pleading to the penalty of a Variance, by his inability to prove it as alleged. WHILE the form in which the Rule above is stated has been objected to as indefinite, its extent arid application may be collected with some degree of precision from the de cided cases, 21 and by considering the limita tions which it necessarily receives from the Rules as to Certainty heretofore mentioned. It substantially covers the same ground, and rests upon the same principle, as the Rule that a Pleading must State Facts, and not Evidence, a nd may be considered as applica ble whenever an Allegation of the Facts in detail would carry the Pleading to an unrea - sonable length by Stating matters proper to be shown in Evidence. Besides the benefit derived from thus confining the Pleadings to reason able limits, a General Mode of stating the existence of Facts involving in them selves matters of detail may often preserve the Pleader from exposing his Allegation to the danger of a Variance, since, if he at tempts to state all such matters, he must do s o correctly, or his Proof will not correspond. 21~ Coryton v.

In Assumpsit, on a promise by the defend ant to pay for all such nece ssaries as his friend should be provided with by the plain tiff, the plaintiff alleged that he provided necessaries amounting to such a sum. It was moved, in Arrest of Judgment, that the Declaration was not good, because he had not shown what necessaries i n particular he had provided. But Coke, C. 3., said, “This is good, as is here Pleaded, for avoiding such multiplicities of reckonings” ; and Dod dridge, J., “This General Allegation, that he had provided him with all necessaries, is good, without showing in particular what they were.” And the Court gave Judgment unanimously for the plaintiff. 22 So, in As - sumpsit for labor and medicines, for curing the defendant of a distemper, the defendant Pleaded Infancy. The plaintiff Replied that the Action was brought for necessaries gen erally. On Demurrer to the Replication, it was objected that the plaintiff had not as signed in certain, how, or in what manner, the medicines were necessary; but it was ad judged that t he Replication, in this General Form, was good, and the plaintiff had Judg ment. 23 So, in Debt on a Bond, conditioned that the defendant shall pay, from time to time, the moiety of all such money as he shall receive, and give"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Page 147 of 735 account of it, he Plead ed Gen erally that he had paid the moiety of all such money, etc. lit per curiam: “This Plea of Payment is good, without showing the particular sums, and that in order to avoid stuffing the Rolls with Multiplicity of Matter.” Also they agreed that, if the con dition had been to pay the moiety of such money as he should receive, without saying “from time to time,” the payment should have been Pleaded Specially. 2 22.

Sec. 59 WHAT PARTICULARITY IS REQUIRED 135 WHEN GENERAL PLEADING IS SUFFICIENT Z8. A General Mode of Pleading is often sufficient when the Allegations on the other side must reduce the matter to Certainty. And when the Nature of the Defense to be inter posed is such that the Opposing Party must necessarily state fully all Facts essential to the production of a complete Issue in the par ticular action, a Party may all ege the grounds of his Action or Defense, or seine of them, in General Terms. THIS Rule comes into most frequent illus tration in Pleading Performance in Actions of Debt on Bond. Bonds may be conditioned either for the Performance of certain mat ters set forth in the Condition, or of the Cov enants or other matters contained in an in denture or other instrument collateral to the Bond, and not set forth in the Condition. In either case, if the defendant has to Plead Performance of such matters, the Law ofte n allows him to do so, in General Terms, with out setting forth the manner of Performance. For by the usual course of Pleading, the plaintiff declares upon the Bond as single, without noticing the Condition, and there fore without alleging any Breach of th e Con dition. It follows, therefore, of course, that if the defendant Pleads Performance, the plaintiff will have to show a Breach in his Replication; and as this will, in all events, lead to a sufficient Certainty of Issue, it be comes unnecessary for the defendant to be Specific on his Part in his Plea, or to do more than allege Performance in General Terms, according to the words of the Condition, leaving the plaintiff in his Replication to Specify the Breach that is supposed to have been committed. WHAT PARTICULARITY IS GENERALLY REQUIRED ~9. No greater Particularity is required than the nature of the thing Pleaded will con veniently admit. And when the Circumstances Constituting a Cause of Action are so numerous and so minute that the Party pleadin g is not and cannot be acquainted with them, less Cer tainty is required, and Pleading in General terms is sufficient. THE effect of this Rule is that the Cer tainty required in Pleading Facts does not require a minute and detailed Statement of Circumstan ces which, though material to a Party’s case, he cannot be presumed to know. 25 Thus, though generally, in an Ac tion for injury to goods, the quantity of the goods must be stated, yet if they cannot, un der the circumstances of the case, be con veniently a scertained by number, weight, or measure, such Certainty will not be required. Accordingly, in Trespass for breaking the plaintiff’s close, with beasts, and eating his peas, a Declaration not showing the quantity of peas has been held sufficient, “because no body can measure the peas that beasts can eat.” ~° So, In an Action on the Case for set ting a house on fire, per quod the plaintiff, among divers other goods, ornatus pro equis aSs - it, after Verdict for the plaintiff, it was objected that this was Unce rtain, but the ob jection was disallowed by the Court. And in this case Windham, 3., said that, if he had mentioned only diversa bona, yet it had been well enough, as a man cannot be supposed to know the Certainty of his goods when his house is burnt; and added that, to avoid pro lixity, the Law will sometimes allow such a Declaration,2 7 In Actions on Contracts, if the case is one where it is held necessary to Declare Spe cially on the Contract, great Strictness and 25, Wirnbish V.

This preliminary statement is called the “Inducement”. It does not enter into the statement of the Cause of Action proper, but is merely ex - planatory of such statement, and it does not require t he same Certainty. 32 The term “Inducement” is sometimes ap plied to those Allegations showing the ex istence of a Right on the part of the plaintiff and a Duty on the part of defendant. The Allegations showing the wrongful acts of the defendant in violati on of the Right and Duty are known as the Gist or Gravamen of the Action. As “Matter of Inducement,” as the term is generally used, is that which is merely in troductory to or explanatory of the essen tial ground of the Complaint or Defense, and “ Matter of Aggravation” such as is alleged only to show, in Actions for forcible injuries, for instance, circumstances of enormity un der which the wrong complained of was com mitted, neither constitutes a Material Fact essential to Recovery or Defense, and either, therefore, is sufficiently met by an Answer to that which forms the Gist of the Action; 32. “Inducement,” In Pleading, is the Statement of Matter which is Introductory to the Principal Sub ject of the Declaration or Plea and which is neces sary t o elucidate or explain it.

The “Inducement” of a Pleading is but an Explana tory Introduction to the Main Allegation In which the Cause of Action Is alleged. McDonald v. Hall, 203 Mi ch. 431, 170 N.W. 68 (1918). and, as they require no distinct Answer, a General Mode of Stating them is sufficient. 33 This Rule is exemplified in the case of the Derivation of Title, where, though it is a General Rule that thc Commencement of a Particular Estate must be shown, yet an exception is allowed if the title be alleged by Way of Inducement only. So, in As sumpsit, the plaintiff declared that in con sideration that, at the defendant’s request, he had given and granted to him, by deed, the next avoid ance of a certain Church, the defendant promised to pay £100, but the Declaration did not set forth any Time or Place at which such grant was made. Upon this being objected in Arrest of Judgment after Verdict the Court resolved that “it was but an Induceme nt to the Action, and there fore needed not to be so precisely alleged,” and gave Judgment for the plaintiff. 34 So, in Trespass, the plaintiff declared that the defendant broke and entered his dwelling house, and “wrenched and forced open, or caused to be wrenched and forced open, the clpset doors, drawers, chests, cupboards, and cabinets of the said plaintiff.” Upon Special Demurrer it was objected that the number of closet doors, drawers, chests, cupboards, and cabinets was not specified. But ft was answe red “that the breaking and entering the plaintiff’s house was the principal ground and foundation of the present action, and all the rest are not foundations of the action, but matters only thrown in to Aggravate the Damages, and, on that ground, need not be particularly specified.” And of that opinion 33.

Thus, a Party Pleading a Contract, Valid by Parol at Common Law, but w hich a subsequent Statute requires to be in Writing, need not allege it to be in Writing. , THE only explanation necessary to be made of this Rule is that, as matters are to be Pleaded according to their Legal Effect, a Statute does not, in regulating the Mode of Performance of an Act, necessarily pre scribe a corresponding method of Pleading it, unless the thing to be pleaded is one cre ated by the Statute itself. If, therefore, an act Valid at Common Law is subsequently required by a Statute to be in wri ting, it may still be Pleaded as at Common Law without alleging writing. 38 Thus, by the Common Law, a lease for any number of years might be made by parol only; but, by the Statute of Frauds, all leases and terms for years made by parol, and not put into writing and signed by the lessors, or their agents authorized by writing, shall have only the effect of leases at will, except leases not exceeding the term of three years from the making. Yet, in a Declaration of Debt for rent on a demise, it was held suf fi cient, as it was at Common Law, to state a demise for any number of years, without 35. Chamberlain v.

It is not necessary to state matters of which the Court takes Judicial Notice. Matters Judicially Noticed may be either of Law or Facts of a Public or General Nature. CERTAIN matters may be omitted. Thus it is not necessary to state in the Pleading Matters of which the Court will take Judi cial Notice. 4 ’ It is therefore unnecessary to state Matter of Law, for this the Judges are bound to know, and can apply for themselves to the Facts aileged. Thus, where it was Stated in a Pleading that an officer of a cor poration was removed for misconduct, by the corporate body at large, it was held un ne cessary to Aver that the power of remov al was vested in such corporate body, because that was a power by Law incident to them, uniess given by some charter, by - law, or oth er authority, to a select part only. 42 The Rule is not limited to the principles of the Common Law. Public Statutes fall within 4°. Case v. Barber, T.Raym. 450, 83 Eng.Bep. 235 (1803). IL. To this effect, see Comyn’s Digest, Pleader,” C, 78 (1822). 42. KIng v. Mayor & Burgesses of Lyme RegIs, 1 Doug. 14 8, 99 Eng.Rep, 07 (1779). the same reason and the same Rule. Public Domestic Statutes and the Facts which they recite or state must be Noticed by the Courts of the Particular State, as well as the Public Acts of Congress, without their being Stated in Plea dings; ~ and it is only necessary to allege Facts which will appear to the Court to be affected by the Statute, 44 though in case of an offense created by Statute, where a penalty is inflicted, the mere Statement of the Facts constituting the offense will be in~ sufficient without an express reference to the Statute, showing the intention to being the case within it. 45 Private Acts, however, are not Judicially Noticed, and therefore such parts of them as may be material to the Ac tion or Defens e, must be Stated in Plead ing, 4 ° and Foreign Statutes, as those of other States, must also be Pleaded. 47 It may be observed, however, that, though it is in general unnecessary to allege Matter of Law, yet there is sometimes occasion to make mention of it , for the convenience or intelligibility of the Statement of Fact. Thus, in an Action of Assumpsit on a Bill of Exchange, the Form of the Declaration is to state that the Bill was drawn or accepted by the defendant, etc., according to the nature of the case, and that the defendant, as draw er or acceptor, etc., became liable to pay; 43. 1 Blaekstone, Commentaries on the Law of Eng land, 85 (2nd Amed.

So, as stated above, it is sometimes necessary to refer to a Public Statute in General Terms, to show that the case is intended to be brought within the Statute; as, for example, to allege that the defendant committed a certa in act against the Form of the Statute in such case made and provided; but the reference is made in this general way only, and there is no need to set the Statute forth. This Rule, by which Matter of Law is omitted in the Pleadings, by no means pre vents the attainment of the requisite Cer tainty of Issue; for, even though the dispute between the Parties should turn upon Mat ter of Law, yet they may evidently obtain a sufficiently Specific Issue of that descrip tion without any Allegation of Law; for ex fa cto jus oritur, that is, every Question of Law necessarily arises out of some given state of Facts; and therefore nothing more is necessary than for each Party to state, alternately, his case in point of Fact; and upon Demurrer to the sufficiency of some o ne of these Pleadings, the Issue of Law, as we have heretofore shown, must at length arise. Besides Points of Law, there are man)’ other matters of a public kind, of which the Court takes Official Notice, and with respect to which it is, for the same reas on, unnec essary to make Allegation in Pleading, such as matters antecedently alleged in the same Record,IS the Time and Place of holding Con gress, or the State Legislature, the Time of its Sessions, and its usual course of proceed ing, the course of the almanac, the division of the state into Counties, the meaning of English words, and terms of art; legal weights and measures, and the ordinary moasurement of time, matters of public his - tory, affecting the whole people, and many other matters. 4 ° MATTERS IN ANTICIPATION 64. It is not necessary to State Matter which would come more properly from the other side. As it is sufficient for each Party to make out his own Case or Defense, he ade quately sup~ ports his Charge or Answer, for the purpose of Pleading, if such Pleading establish a prima facie case in his favor, and is not bound to anticipate matter which his Adversary may be at liberty to Plead against him. EXCEPTION — Pleadings in Est oppel and Dilatory Pleas must meet and remove, by anticipation, every possible Answer. TIlE ordinary Form of this Rule, namely, that it is not necessary to State Matters which would come more properly from the other side, does not fully express its mean i ng. The meaning is that it is not necessary to anticipate the answer of the adversary, or, as it is generally expressed, when reference is made to the Declaration only, it is not nec essary to anticipate Defenses.M This, ac 40.

Sec. 65 MATTERS IMPLIED 141 cording to Hale, C. 3., is “like leaping be fore one comes to the stile.” ~ It is sufficient that Each Pleading should, in itself, contain a good prima fade case, without r eference to possible objections not yet urged. Thus, in Pleading a devise of land by force of the Statute of Wills, it is sufficient to allege that such a one was seised of the land in fee, and devised it by his last will, in writ ing, without Alleging tha t such devisor was of full age. For, though the Statute pro vides that wills made by fernes covert, or persons within age, etc., shall not be taken to be effectual, yet, if the devisor were within age, it is for the other Party to show this in his Answer, and it need not be Denied by anticipationA~ So, in a Declara tion of Debt upon a Bond, it is unnecessary to allege that the defendant was of full age when he executed it.~ So, where an Action of Debt was brought upon a Statute against the bailiff of a town for not returning the plaintiff, a burgess of that town, for the last Parliament, the words of the Statute being that the Sheriff shall send his precept to the Mayor, and, if there be no Mayor, then to the bailiff, the plaintiff declared that the Sheriff had made his precept unto the bailiff, without Averring that there was no Mayor. And, after Verdict for the plaintiff, this was moved in Arrest of Judgment. But the Court was of opinion, clearly, that the Dec laration was good, “for we shall not intend tha t there was a Mayor except it be showed; and, if there were one, it should come more properly on the other side.” M So, where there was a Covenant in a charter party ‘that no claim should be admitted, or al ~i.

But the Court held that, if such survey had not been taken, this was Matter of Defense, which ought to have been shown by the defendants, and refused to Arrest the Judgment.~ But where the Matter is Such that its Af firmation or Denia l is essential to the appar ent or prima facie right of the Party Plead ing, then it ought to be Affirmed or Denied by him in the first instance, though it may be such as would otherwise properly form the subject of objection on the other side. MATTERS IM PLIED 65. It is not necessary to allege Circum stances Necessarily Implied. Necessary Cir cumstances implied by Law from Facts al leged are Traversable without being Pleaded, and need not therefore be alleged. A FOURTH subordinate Rule is that it is not necessary to allege Circumstances Nec essarily Implied from Facts that are al leged. 56 The reason of this Rule seems to be that as the Law will always Imply Certain Facts from the Statement of Others, and the Issue tendered by the Allegation of such Pri ma ry Facts alone is therefore sufficient for a Traverse by the Adverse Party, so the Facts thus to be implied need no Express Al legation to render the statement of the case complete on either side.

The pl aintiff Replied that after the making of the Bond, and before the time for making the Award, the defendant, by his certain writing, revoked the authority of the said W.R., contrary to the form and effect of the said condition. Upon Demurrer it was held tha t this Replication was good, without Averring that W.R. had notice of the Revo cation, because that was implied in the words “revoked the authority,” for there could be no Revocation without notice to the arbitra tor; so that, if W.R. had no Notice, it wou ld have been competent to the defendant to Tender Issue “that he did not revoke in man ner and form as alleged.” M So, if a feoff ment be Pleaded, it is not necessary to al lege livery of seisin, for it is implied in the word “enfeoffed.” ~ So, if a man Pl ead that he is heir to A., he need not allege that A. is dead, for it is implied. 50 MATTERS PRESUMED 66. It is not necessary to allege what the Law will presume. As legality in the trans actions or conduct of persons is always pre sumed, everything is regarded as legally done until the contrary is shown. TFIUS, it is an Intendment of Law that a person is innocent of fraud, as well as free from every imputation against his character, and one insisting on the contrary must both Plead and Prove it. 6 ° So the performance of an act is presumed where the omission would render one criminally liable, and the burden of alleging and proving the negative is on the party who asserts it. 6 ’ Thus, in &1.

Surplusage is to be avoided. The Per fection of Pleading is to combine the requisite Certainty and Precision with the greatest pos sible br evity of statement. “Surplusage,” as the term is used in the present Rule, includes matter of any description which is unnecessary to the maintenance of the Action or Defense. The Rule requires the omission of such mat ter in two instances: (I) When the matter is wholly foreign and irrelevant to the Merits of the Case; and"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Page 155 of 735 (II) When, though not wholly foreign, such matter need not be stated. THE term “Surplusage,” as used in this chapter, is taken in the broad sense of in cluding all unnecessar y matter, whether its 62. Wlbon v. Hobday, 4 T,4. & 5. 325, 105 EngItep. 782 (1815). 63.

In either case it is a fault to be avoided, as n ot only tending to cause prolixity in the Pleadings, but also frequently affording an advantage to the Opposite Party, by providing him with an objection on the ground of Variance, or by compelling the Party Pleading to adduce more Evidence than would othe rwise have been necessary. It is therefore of the ut most importance to avoid both the state ment of unnecessary facts and the Allega tion of Facts which, though they may be rel evant, are not essential to a Proper State ment of the Claim or Defense.° 3 If the matter stated be wholly foreign and impertinent, so that no Allegation on the sub ject was necessary, it does not vitiate the Pleading, the maxim being that “utile, per inutile, non vitkztur’ nor does it require proof, but it will be entirely rejected .° 6 If, 64.

Where, however, inconsistency or discrepancy on the Face of the Record is created by Surplus Allegations, this fault is to be taken advantage of by Special Demur rer)’ DESCRIPTIVE AVERMENTS 68. Every Descriptive Averment, though made with Unnecessary Particularity, must be proved as laid, or it will be a fatal Variance. THE harsh Rule by which the Courts pun ish a Party who Pleads Immaterial Facts by compelling him to prove them literally as all eged, although they need never have been set out to state the Cause of Action is shock ingly illustrated in negligence cases. New Trials have frequently been granted for Want of Proof of wholly Unnecessary alle gations. The Pleader has to steer his course between Scylla and Charybdis, and is driv en to state his case in a confusing variety of Counts, which multiply and complicate the Issues. He has to learn just how General he may make his Allegations, avoiding all un necessary detail, on the one hand, and the danger of stating mere Conclusions of Law or Fact, on the other. By Unnecessary Par ticularity in a descriptive statement, he binds himself to prove this Surplusage in ad dition to the essential Facts of the case. Yet it is recognized that Averments of Mere Sur plusage, which are not “matter of descrip tion,” are immaterial and need not be prov ed. 72 Thus, where a plaintiff, in Action for 71.

The Pleader should ascertain what are the vital ele ments of his Action or Defense, and then examine the decisions of his own state to lean just how gen eral he may make his Allegations; for he is above all to avoid unnecessary detail. As we have al ready seen, by unnecessarily particularizing In a de scriptive Allegation he binds himself to prove these unnecessary particulars In addition to the essential Facts of the descmiption. Thus, In an Action on the Personal Injuries against the railroad, al leged that at the time of the injury she was standing at the intersection of a street and the main tracks of the defendant’s railroad, the Court expressed the op inion that it would be a material Variance if the Proof showed that she was then standing twenty - five or thirty feet from this point.’ 3 But the precise place where the personal injury occurs is not ordinarily an element in the Cause of Ac tion, and it is s ufficient to state the County in which the injury took place. 74 It is not necessary for a passenger, who is suing a railroad for injuries, to state the termini be tween which he was being carried; but, if he does state them, the Allegations will require st rict"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Page 157 of 735 Proof. 75 These decisions are placed on the ground that the great object of a Decla ration is to notify the defendant of the na ture and character of the plaintiff’s demand, so that he may be able to prepare for a De fense. If, however, the Pleader ma ke his Allega tions of particulars under a videlicet, that the injury occurred on a certain day, v4z., on March 1, 1916, then the Count will not limit the plaintiff to the precise day alleged, but admits Proof that the injury occurred at any time within th e period of the Statute of Limitations. 76 There is equal notice in either event, whether the “Viz” is used or not.

Pugh,” where a note was received in Evidence, and the amount of the note was a half cent larger than the amount alleged in the Declaration, t his was held a fatal error in Matter of Substance. The Illi nois Supreme Court, although regretting that such a trifling slip should delay a Party in the Administration of Justice, sent the plaintiff back for a New Trial, in order that the Science of Commo n - Law Pleading might not be impaired. In another case, the differ ence between the instrument described and that offered in Evidence of a dollar mark after the amount of the subscription was held a fatal Variance, although the body of the contract showed w hat was intended. 78 If the plaintiff had declared on the Indebi tatus Counts, he might have proved the exe cution of the instrument and established the indebtedness without any details at all. In an Action of Assumpsit upon a note alleged in the Declarati on to have been executed by “Wiffiam” Becker, the plaintiff offered at the Trial a note signed by “Wilhelm” Becker. This was admitted in Evidence over Objec tion and the Judgment for plaintiff was Re versed for Variance. 79 REPUGNANCY 69. A Pleading is bad for Repugnancy when it contains Contradictory or Inconsistent Alle gations, which destroy or neutralize each other. There is an Exception to this Rule when the Allegation creating the fault is Superfluous. REPUGNANCY is a fault in al l Pleading, and the reason of the rule is clearly apparent, On the office and effect oof the Videlleet or Seiiieet to separate non - essential details, see Obicago Terminal Transfer B.

DECLARATION — MANNER OF PLEADING Out on Motion, and will not Vitiate the Pleading; for the maxim is “Utile, per mu tile, non vi tiatur.” 8 ’ AMBIGUITY OR DOUBT 70. Pleadings must not be Ambiguous or Doubtful in Meaning; and, when two different meanings present themselves, that construction shall be adopted which is most unfavorable to the Pleader. Ambiguity in Pleading occurs where the matter alleged may have several meanings; but a Pleading is not objectionable on this ground if it be clear enough for its true meaning to be ascertained, according to reasonable intendment or construction, though not worded with absolute precision. THE Pleader must avoid stating the mat ter of his Claim or Defense in such a man ner as to render it so Doubtful or Obscure that, upon its face, it will be uncertain what he means to allege. 85 Thus, if, in Trespass quare clausuni fregit, the defendant Pleads that the locus in quo was his freehold, he must allege that it was his freehold at the time of the Trespass; otherwise, the Plea is insufficient. 86 So, in Debt on a Bond, condi tioned to make assurance of land, if the de fendant Pleads that he executed a release, his Plea is bad if it does not express that the release concerns the same land. 87 In determining which of two meanings that present themselves shall be adopted, that construction is given that is most un favorable to the Party Pleading, since it is presumed that every person states his case 84.

The Plea must therefore show the performance of one of the acts, and also clearly point out which one was completed. Thus, in an Action of Debt agai nst a jailer for the escape of a prisoner, where the de fendant Pleaded that if the said prisoner did, at any time or times after the said commit ment, etc., ~o at large he so escaped without the knowledge of the defendant, and against his will, and that, if any such escape was made, the prisoner voluntarily returned in to custody before the defendant knew of the escape, etc., the Court held the Plea bad, for “he cannot Plead Hypothetically that, if there has been an escape, there has also been a return. He must either stand upon an Averment that there has been no escape, or that there have been one, two, or ten escapes, after which the prisoner returned.” °~ So, where it was charged that the defendant wrote and pub lished, or caused to be written and published, a certain libel, this was con sidered as bad for uncertainty.M v.

Alternative or Hypothetical pleading is a Defect in Form, objectionable on Special De murrer only.° 5 DUPLICITY IN GENERAL 72. Duplicity, or Double Pleading, consists in alleging two or more distinct grounds of Complaint or Defense for a single object, when one only would be sufficient. The fault may exist in, and the Rule therefore applies to (I) The Declaration; and (II) The Su bsequent Pleadings. THE requirement of the Common Law that Pleadings shall not be Double has for its object the Attainment of the Singleness or Unity of the Issue between the Parties, which it is the aim of all Pleadings to pro duce. It precludes both pla intiff and defend ant, in their respective Pleadings, from stat ing or relying upon more than one matter, constituting a sufficient Ground of Action in respect to the Same Demand, or an effective Defense to the same Claim, or an adequate Answer to the Preceding Pleading of the op ponent.° 6 The Rule in its terms points to ~ Oglethorp v, Hyde, Cro.Eliz, 233, 78 Eng.Bep. 488 (1594); Hodgeon v.

Cases arise where the plaintiff is uncertain against which of several persons he Is entitled to relief, as where several corporations operate a line of track, or where a defendant may have been acting either as an agent or as a principal. In such cases som e Modern Rules of Procedure allow the plaintiff to join any or all of them as defendants in the alter native. It is also deemed convenient under Modern Rules to allow a Party to include in his Pleading two or more alternative sets of Material Facts. even t bough inconsistent, and to claim Belief there under in the alternative, upon an alternative con struction or ascertainment of his Cause of Action, without the necessity of making an election. 96.

No Matter will operate to make a Plead ing flouble that is Pleaded only as Necessary Inducement to another Allegation. THUS, it may be Pleaded, without Duplic ity, that after the Cause of Action accrued the plaintiff (a woman) took a husband, and that the husband afterwards released the de fendant; for though the eoverthre is itself a Defense, as well as the release, yet the Averment of the coverture is a necessary in troduction to that of the release. 98 This Ex - ception to the Genera] Rule is prescribed by an evident principle of Justice; for the Par ty has a Right to Rely on any single matter that he pleases, in preference to another, as, in this instance, on the release in preference to t he coverture. But if a Necessary Induce ment to the matter on which he relies, when itself amounting to a Defense, were held to make his Pleading Double, the effect would be to exclude him from this right, and com pel him to rely on the Inducement only. CONSEQUENCES OF DUPLICITY 74. Duplicity is a Fault in Form, and can only be objected to by Special Demurrer. THIS Rule results necessarily from the Nature of the Fault, which is not in the Sub stance of the Matter Pleaded, but in the Statement of Matter in excess of what is nec essary to constitute a valid Claim, or An swer.

The Rule requiring the Demurrer for Du plicity to be Special, finds no application in the case of Misjoinder of Causes of Action, since a plaintiff who joins in the same Dec laration different Counts, containing sepa rate and incongruous Causes of Action, as distinct Grounds of Recovery, commits a radical Fault, and his Declaration is bad, either on General Demurrer or in Arrest of Judgment or on Writ of Error. 2 2.

Every Pleading should state only such Facts as are True and Capable of Proof, avoid ing False and Frivolous Allegations tending to deceive the Court and the Adversary, and to del ay the progress of the Trial. AT Common Law, while it is a principle that Pleadings ought to be true, yet there are no means of enforcing the Rule. Thus the Common - Law Pleadings fail to uncover the Real Issues in dispute. The Illinois Practice Act (Section 52) made provision that the Denial of the Execution or Assignment of an Instrument in Writing, when a copy is filed with the Pleading, must be Verified by Affidavit. The Illinois Practice Act (Sec tion 55) gav e the plaintiff the option in Ac tions on Contract for the payment of money to file an Affidavit as to the amount due, and thereby require the defendant to file with his Plea an Affidavit of Merits which must specify the Nature of the Defense. The pur pose of this is to give the plaintiff notice of the Real Defense to be presented and to limit the Issues to be tried. It is usually provided in Reformed Sys tems of Pleading that the plaintiff may Ver ify his Complaint, and then the Denials of the Answer must be Specific, and must also be made Under Oath with the Penalties of Perjury for Falsehood. This requires the defendant to put in Issue only the Points on which he means to Rely. Thus, in a Suit on a Fire Insurance Policy, there may be no dispute as to the Execution of the Contract sued on; but the company may expect to avoid liability by showing in Defense some Excuse, such as Breach of Warranty by the insured. Accordingly, if the Complaint be Verified, the company cannot deny the sig nature or due executi on of the policy, of murrcr. Bose v.

Pleadings should observe the known and ancient expressions as contained in approved precedents. When there has been a long.estab. lished Form of Pleading, containing Allega tions of Frequent and Ordinary Occurrence applicable to the Facts of a Particular C ase, it should in general be adopted for the sake of Uniformity and Certainty. THIS Rule is not to be taken as an imper ative one, except in certain cases where pre cise technical expressions or terms are re quired to be used. At the same time it is safer to follow approved precedents, other wise there is danger of omitting an Aver ment which might, on account of precedent, be considered essential to the particular Pleading. The General Issues are examples of forms of expression, fixed by ancient usage, f rom which it is improper to depart. And another illustration of this Rule occurs in the follow ing English case: To an Action on the Case, the defendants Pleaded the Statute of Limi tations, namely, “that they were Not Guilty within six years,” etc. The Co urt decided, upon Special Demurrer, that this Form of Pleading was bad, upon the ground that “from the passing of the Statute to the pres ent case the invariable Form of Pleading the Statute to an Action on the Case for a wrong has been to allege that the Cause of Action 3. Bliss, Code Pleadings §~ 135, 422. See Higgins Carpet Co. v. Latimer, 165 Pa. 617, 30 At!. 1050 (1895); English order 21, rule 9. By the rules 33 of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, Allegations and Denials, made without reasonable cause and found untrue, subjected the Party Pleading them to the payment of such reasonable expenses caused to the Other Party by such Untrue Pleading. did not accrue within six years,” etc.; and that “it was important to the Administra~ tion of Justice that th e usual and establish ed Forms of Pleading should be observed.” The Rule stated is of rather uncertain ap plication, for it must be often doubtful whether a given form of expression has been so fixed by the course of precedent as to ad mit of no variation. In a New York case the Lower Court held a Declaration in Case for Deceit in the sale of property bad, even after Verdict, because it failed to allege the scien ter on the part of the defendant in making the sale, which was in accordanc e with prec edent, and was deemed essential. “To dis pense with the Rule,” said Kent, C. J., “would be a dangerous relaxation, and might lead to the loss of Certainty and Precision in Plead ing. General Rules will sometimes appear harsh and rigorous in the ir application to particular cases; but I entertain a decided opinion that the established principles of pleading, which compose what is called its science, are rational, concise, luminous, and admirably adapted to the investigation of truth, and ought, co nsequently, to be very cautiously touched by the hand of innova tion.” ~ On Writ of Error, this decision was reversed on the ground that the Defect was Aided or Cured by Verdict.° 4.

The typical elements or grounds constitut ing a cause of action differ With the differ ent Forms of Action, whether in Tor t, Con tract or Property. And in Common Law Pleading the Declaration must state a cause of action in the particular form or theory of action selected. And, in order to do this, the plaintiff must state facts in his declaration that will (1) meet the test o f a General De murrer; and (2) which he can Prove at the Trial; for it will do the pleader no good to get by the Shoal of Demurrer if he is going to wreck on the Rock of Variance. In Tort Actions IN Tort Actions the plaintiff is, in general, to allege and prove merely the nature of the harm and defendant’s share in causing it. Matters of Justification and Excuse, as self - defense, leave and license, contributory neg ligence, consent or privilege, are put on the defendant to plead and prove, sin ce it is un fair to assume that any of them are present or to require the plaintiff to disprove the existence of each.

In Slander and Libel, on the oth er hand, the plaintiff is re lieved from the burden of showing the falsi ty of the defamatory words, and the defend ant must prove the truth of his slanderous utterance in defense — a rule well calculated to give a man pause in making slanderous statements a bout his neighbors. As the first of the Tort Actions, let us now consider the Action of Trespass, keeping in mind that one of our principal considerations is always, what facts must be alleged in or der to state a good cause of action? SCOPE OF THE ACTIO N 77. The Action of Trespass lies for the re covery of Damages for an injury to the person~ property, or relative rights of another: (I) Where the injury was committed with force, actual or implied; (IL) Where the injury was immediate, and not merely con sequential; (III) In case of injury to property, where the property was in the actual or constructive possession of the plain — tiff at the time of the injury. THE term “Trespass” , in its broadest sense, includes any offense or voluntary transgression against the law of nature, of society, or of the country in which we live, whether such act relates to a person or to his property. In a more restricted sense, it. signifies an injury committed with violence, either actual or implied; and the law will imply violence though none is actually used, when the injury is of a direct and immediate character, and committed on the person or - on the corporeal and tangible property, real or persona l, of the plaintiff. Of actual vio lence, an assault and battery is an example; of implied violence, a peaceable but wrong - ful entry upon another’s land. 2 Where, however, the injury was indirect and consequential, the remedy was Trespass on the Case, and here it should be observed that the two delictual remedies of Trespass and Trespass on the Case have divided be tween them the entire field of tort; they sup plement each other in this respect. In con sequence, if Damage occurs as a result of a wrongful a ct or omission other than a breach 2. 3 Blaekstone, Commentaries on the Laws of Eng land, c. XII, Of Trespass, 208 — 209 (7th e& Oxford 1775). Sec. 77 ACTLON OF TRESPASS ‘53 of contract, Trespass or Case become the accepted remedy, - if the act was of such char acter as to constitute a wrong for which a civil action was available. There were other tort remedies such as Detinue, Replevin and Trover, but, broadly speaking, an act was not regarded as a tart except where it was remediable in Trespass or some Form of Trespass on the Case. 3 The early history on the Writ of Trespass is of great significance to the legal scholar as the fountain source of our law of torts. It was long th e only Common Law remedy based on the conception of giving compensa tion for Damage resulting from wrongful acts. And prior to its emergence the law of torts was in a primative and confused state. As yet there was no distinction between pub lic and private wrongs, and the rules applica ble to crime were yet to be formulated into a separate body of law. And this explains why, in its origin, Trespass was dual in char acter, being Part Criminal and Part Civil. Enforcement of such law of torts as existed was le ft to the Local Courts, of which the Written Records are few. When, however, the Writ found its way into the Royal Courts, the Common Law theory of tort liability gradually began to take definite form. 4 According to Pollock and Maitland, the Action of Tre spass was descended from the old Writ of breve de traits gressione; ~ and although in its settled form it was quite un common in 1250, it had become common by 1272.6 By the reign of Edward I (1272 — 3~ 3 Street, Foundations of Legal Liability; c. XVII, The Action of Trespass, 223 (Northport 1906). 4. Id. at 225. 5 - 2 Polkek and Maitlarni, History of English Law, c. VIII, Crime and Tort, 3, The Trespassers, 523 — 529 (Cambridge"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Page 166 of 735 1805). 6. ‘The recorded Instances of Trespass in the Royal Courts prior to 1252 are very few. In the ‘Abbre viatlo Placitorum’ some twenty.flve eases of appeals of different kinds are mentioned, belonging to the perIod 1104 — 1252, but not a single case of Trespass. In the year 37 Henry III (1252 — 1253) no fewer than 1307) the Writ of Trespass had found its Way into the Register of Writs. 7 But the authorities have not been in agreement as to the origin of the action. Ames, Holmes and Maitland tell us that Trespass originat ed from the Appeal of Felony, which lay far su ch crimes as homicide, mayhem, rape, wounthn~ and battery, or for property inju - ries, such as arson and larceny, or for rob bery. 8 Naturally, the earliest wrongs to call for remedy were those committed with force and violence, such as Trespass to real est ate, accompanied by Damage to the defendant’s goods and chattels,° assault and battery, false imprisomnent, or abduction of the plaintiff’s wife. By authority of the Writ of Trespass a plaintiff was able to secure redress for Damage done to his person, his possession of goods or land, or his domestic relations, by direct physical interference. A trespass may be committed either upon the person of another, as in the case of as sault, assauit and battery, or false arrest or imprisonment; or upon his real or personal property, as where a person enters upon an other’s land, or takes or merely injures his twenty - live cases of Trespass are recorded, and from this time on the action is frequent, while ap peals are rarely brought.” Amos, Lectures on Le gal History , Lecture IV, Trespass Dc Bonis Asporta Us, 56 (Cambridge 1913). 7.

Many of the early eases Involvod a tresp ass to both real and personal property. In such cases the plaintiff alleged the trespass for, let us say, the breaking and entering of the dwelling house, as the principal trespass, and then added the injury to the personal property Incidental thereto, as was said, by way of aggravation of damages. For a case in volving this point, see Chamberlain v. Greenfield, 2 WmML 810, 06 Eng.Rep. 476 (1772). 154 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 7 goods; or upon his relative rights, as where a person beats or debauches another’ s daugh ter or servant. All trespasses, whether to person, property or relative rights, whether committed with actual or implied force, were and are called “trespass vi et armis.” As we have seen, a trespass is an injury committed with violence, and this violence may be either actual or implied; and the law will imply violence, even though none was actually used, where the injury is of a direct and immediate kind, and committed on t he persan or the tangible and corporeal prop erty of the plaintiff; 1° that is, if the injury is direct, and not consequential, the proper remedy to recover damages is by the Action of Trespass.” U, however, a tort is committed without force, either actua l or implied, or the injury was merely consequential, or if, in the case of injury to property, the plaintiff’s right or interest was only in reversion at the time of the injury, Trespass will not lie, and the rem edy, as will be seen, must be by an Action on the Case or Trover’ 2 10.

In alleging plaintiff’s Right, Title, In terest or Possession in the various Actions of Trespass: (I) For injuries to the person no state ment of the right is required. (0) For injuries to real or personal prop erty, or to relative rights: (A) In General: (1) The technical limits of Tres pass to the party in posses sion, or with the immediate right of possession, are probably due to its orig in as a semi - criminal action, cov ering a wrongful application of force which might lead to violence and a breach of the peace; (2) Possession is to be distin guished from the custody of a servant; and a bailee at will is given the rights of a possessor, though for most purposes his posses sion Is that of the bailor; (3) In some states both a tenant at will and the landlord may sue in Trespass; (II) For injuries to real or personal prop erty, or to relative rights — Cont’d (A) In General — Cont’d (4) The family of the owner are licensees and do not have possession by reason of their occupancy alone; (5) The owner of land not in the actual possession of another is said to be in constructive possession; that is, he is given the remedies of a pos sessor (6) Naked possession is suffi cient as against a wrong doer. (B) Specifically, the Declaration in Actions of Trespass to Property, Real or Person al, or to Relative Rights should: (I) State the property or thing affected and the Title or Right of the plaintiff in re lation thereto; (2) Show such possession, ac tual or constructive, as is sufficient to sustain the ac tion; (3) Describe the property suffi ciently for identification, hut the plaintiff’s Title or Inter est may be generaliy st ated.

But since the right of personal security and liberty belong to all, there is no necessity of alleging their existence in the pleading; the court takes judicial n otice thereof.

The lower Court sustained an Action of Trespass for such consunip tion, and, of course, on Appeal the Judgment was reversed. merely in reversion, his remedy was in Tres pass on the Case, no t Trespass.’° A General and Special Property interest IT is frequently said that an Allegation of a General or Special Property Interest is sufficient to support an Action of Trespass. This is true if properly understood. Thus, the general owner of personal prop erty, who parts with custody thereof, does not necessarily part with his possession so as to prevent his maintaining Trespass against a stranger. The person who has the absolute or general property interest ‘~ may m aintain the action, though, when the in jury occurred, he had parted with the custody to a carrier, servant, or other agent, where it appears that he gave the latter only a bare authority to carry or keep, not coupled with any special interest in the prope rty. And generally, if the owner of - personal property merely permits another gratuitously to use it, having a right to retake possession at any time, he may sue a stranger in Trespass for an injury done to it while it was so used.’ - ~ The rule applies equ ally to an Action of Tres pass by a bailee who had an authority, coupled with an interest, and a right to irnme 16.

Plimpton, 30 Vt. 333 (1858), has no possession, a ctual or constructive.22 While there appears to be no very substantial distinction between the custody of a servant and the possession of a depositary at will, nevertheless, the bailee is allowed the p05 - sessory remedies, but the servant is not. A servant or agent is denied the rights and remedies of a possessor, because his acts are the acts of his employer, and hence the rights which he represents are those of his employ er. 23 By an anomaly of the Common Law, a subservient bailee, like a depositary for st orage, who holds, like a servant, entirely at the orders of the bailor, is yet regarded as having legal possession rather than mere custody and hence may sue a trespasser. There can hardly be such a thing as pos session in law, entitling one to the posses sory remedies, without a claim of Title, or at least some independent claim of a limited or temporary interest. A tenant at will or a bailee at will has possession as against the public in general, though for most purposes his holding is the possession of the owner. Trespass to Real Propefly — Quare Clau.sum Fregit WITH a few exceptions what has been said with reference to alleging Title in Trespass to Personal Property applies equally in alleg ing Title to Real Property.

In such case the posses sion is said to be constructively or actually in the owner, and he may maintain Trespass as if he had been in actual possession him self? 0 Likewise, the family or servants, the guests or l odgers, of a householder, do not have possession, even during the absence of the owner, as there is no claim of title or interest on their part even at the time. Their occupation is regarded as entirely subordi nate to and in the name of the owner. Pos ses sion implies some claim of title or inde pendent holding. 3 ’ A Wisconsin case 32 il lustrates a questionable failure to apply this doctrine. It appeared that B, the defendant, had committed a trespass during the absence of C, the husband of the plaintiff, A . In an action by A, the wife, it was held that she had sufficient possession to maintain Trespass, on the theory that she was in the exclusive occupation of the premises in the absence of her husband. It is submitted that the court overlooked the point th at occupancy and residence are not possession, unless under a Claim of Title of some sort. The situation of the wife would appear to be like that of 28. Campbell v. Arnold, I Johns. (N.Y.) 511 (1806); Tobey v. Webster, 3 Johns. (N.Y.) 468 (1808). 29. Illinois: Kankakee & S. B. Co. v.

By his wrongful act of destroying the trees, the authorit ies argued, the tenant terminated the lease at will, restored the possession to the landlord, who then proceeded with his Action of Tres pass. In reality, even after the wrongful act, the tenant at will remained in actual physical possession, and to say th at the act restored possession to the landlord was a pure fiction — a fiction which continued in operation until the Action of Trespass on the Case came into operation as a Remedy for injury to reversionary interests. Somewhat the same sort of development to ok place when Trespass was originally permitted as a remedy in the seduction cases on the the ory that the wrongdoer has interfered with the master’s possessory interest in his serv ant, to wit, his daughter. In this instance, as in the tenancy at will, a fiction was cou pled with the Action of Trespass to bridge a remedial gap, until Case came in as a rem edy for the indirect consequential injury to the father resulting from the seduction of his daughter. 4 ° A Mere Naked Possession as Sufficient Title Agai nst a Wrongdoer SINCE the days of the Ancient Real Pos sessory Actions, or more specifically, since the appearance of the Assize of Novel Dis seisin, one forcibly ousted from his posses sion could be summarily restored to his pos session.

Unde r the early Common Law, if the so - called Title, which was only an older possession, was involved, the remedy was by Writ of Right. 4 ’ In consequence of this development, it be came e~tablished law that a mere naked pos session, without any other Title, is s ufficient as against a wrongdoer. In the case of Gra ham v. Peat, 42 The Court declared: “Any pos session is a legal possession against a wrong doer.” Possession is a sufficient Title to the plaintiff in an Action of Trespass vi et armis against a wrongdoer ; the finder of an article may maintain Trespass against any person but the real owner; and, a person having an illegal possession may support this action against any person other than the true own er. 43 A bailee may maintain Trespass against a stranger, or even the general owner, for an injury to the property which is in his pos session, 44 and, as we have seen, even where 4.

He must at least show a right to immediate possession and the absence of adverse pos session}~ Where the Property or Right injured is in tangible WHERE the property or right injured is intangible, that is, not involving possession, the injury can never be considered as Tres pass, but the remedy must be by a n Action on the Case. 5 ° Trespass will not lie, for in stance, for obstructing a private right of way, where the oVmer of the right does not own or possess the way itself. 57 Nor will it lie for ob structing a public highway, 58 or a navigable But, if a tena ncy at will had been terminated by no. tlce, and the tenant had merely remained in posses sion, he cannot maintain the action against his landlord.

DECLARATION IN TRESPASS — ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS~ (3) THE DEFENDANT’S WRONGFUL ACT 81. The Wrongful Act must be a direct ap plication of force, however slight, something that might cause a breach of the peace. The injury must be immediate and not merely con sequential upon the defendant’s act. Trespass lies for an mmediate and forcible injury to person or property by an intentional or negli gent act. Trespass will not lie for Malicious Prosecu tion, nor for act s done under Authority of Process Regularly Issued. Trespass will lie for Abuse of Authority of Law, making the wrongdoer a Trespasser Ab Initio. The Declaration must state the wrong or in jury violating the plaintiff’s right, and must on the face of it show a Trespass; that is, an injury committed with Force, Actual or Im plied, and an injury that was Direct and Im mediate upon the defendant’s Act, and not merely Consequential.

For consequential injuries, even though there may have been force, the remedy is by Action on the Case, an d not Trespass’s If a person, in the act of throwing a log into the highway hits and injures a passer by, the injury is immediate upon the wrong ful act, and Trespass will lie; but, If afte r a log has been wrongfully thrown into the highway, a passer - by f ails over it, Trespass will not ~ So if a steam roller were driv en over a person this would be a clear Tres pass, but if it were negligently left in the highway and a collision with a team or auto mobile resulted in the darkness, this would be a consequential injury. To constitute an immediate injury com mitted with force, it is not necessary that the wrongdoer shall have intended to apply the force in the manner in which it caused the inj ury. If a man puts in motion a force, the natural and probable tendency of which is to cause an injury, he is regarded in law as having forcible and directly caused that injury. 80 11’, for instance, a person lays rub bish so near another’s wall that, as a natural consequence, some of it rolls against the wall, the injury is forcible and immediate, and the remedy is in Trespass. 8 ’ And where the defendant had ascended iii a balloon, which descended a short distance from the place of ascent into the plaintiff’ s garden, and the defendant, being entangled and in a 78.

STATUS UNDER MODERN COnES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES OF COURT 83. Although the Codes provided for the abolition of the distinctions between the various Common Law Actions, with respect to Tres pass, and Case, it has generally been held that such provision merely abolished the Formal differences between the actions, w ith the Sub stantive differences remaining. AS previously observed, one effect of the New York Code of Procedure in 1848 was ostensibly to abolish the Common Law Forms of Action, and the distinctions be tween the same, But the reform was not as sweeping a s the language indicated. There was to be but one form of civil action in the Courts of Common Law, which was to be called an “Action at Law.” In plain English, the various statutes of this character, in the various states adopting the New York Code, provi ded for a single, formless form of ac tion, in the nature of a Special Action on the Case. But in Goulet v. Asseler, 8 Selden J. flatly declared that the more formal dif ferences between such actions had been abol - ished, but that the substantive differences remained as at Common Law. It was, he said, impossible to make an action for a direct aggression upon the plaintiff’s rights by talc - 8. 22 N.Y. 225 (1860).

True, the Statute has abolished the 11s - tinetion between [the] Actions of Trespass and Trespass on the Case, But this relates to the dis ti netlan in Form only.

The change goes only to the matter of the Form of Action, and does not change Substantial Rights and Liabilities. Nor do we understand that this statute re peals that old and more than well settled principle, that in all Actions the Proofs must correspon d with the Allegations. Where a Declaration is filed showing a good cause of action in either Trespass or Case, it is whol ly immaterial whether you call your action Trespass or Case, but such facts must be al leged as show a Legal Cause of Action in the o ne Form or the other, and the facts that are alleged in the pleading must be support ed by the proofs. If the Declaration is in Trespass quare clau.sum fregit, then there must be a possession in order to support it — either actual, or in case the premises a re vacant and unoccupied, a constructive pos session that follows Ownership and Title.” ILLINOIS REV. ST. c. 110, § 22, 36 (1874), provided: “The distinctions between the Actions of ‘Trespass’ and ‘Trespass on the Case’ are hereby abolished; and in all cases where Trespass or Trespass on the Case has been heretofore the appropriate Form of Action, either of said Forms may be used, as the party bringing the action may elect.” The position of Trespass under Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court is strikingly illustrated by Avery v. Spicer,” in which the plaintiff, in an action for cutting trees, alleged ownership and possession of the land, an unlawful entry by the defendants, and acts done thereon to its direct injury by 11. 90 Conn. 5 76, 98 A. 135 (1916). 172 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 7 force. One defendant justified his acts under authority of Spicer, both defendants claiming that Spicer owned in fee simple the land upon which the cutting was done and was in pos session thereof. The Replication denied these allegations. At the Trial, it appeared that the dispute grew out of a disagreement as to the location of the boundary line between the properties of the contending parties. The plaintiff claimed, as evidenced by title deeds, up to a point beyond which the cutting took place, whereas the defendant Spicer contended that his ownership included the property on which the cutting took place. The Court instructed the Jury that the plaintiff, in order to be entitled to a Verd ict, must prove that he was in actual or construc tive possession of the land; that it was not necessary that the plaintiff show actual pos session, but that sufficient proof of posses sion would be produced by proof of Title and the absence of actual and exclusive posses sion in another. On an Appeal, the validity of this Charge to the Jury was the principal issue. In hold ing for the defendants and that there was no error, Chief Justice Prentice"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Page 187 of 735 observed: “Passing by Trespass with its requirement of poss ession as a prerequisite of recovery, there was in the Common - Law System a Form of Action providing for the redress of an injury suffered by one having an interest in property, but not having the possession. By an Action of Trespass on the Case one whose r eversionary interest had been invad ed by a wrongdoer might have redress. But the Action could not be resorted to by one whose interest, instead of being reversion - ary, was such as the right of possession at tached to it. A fee owner, for example, might n ot avail himself of it to redress a wrong done to his property by direct force, express or implied, His interest is posses sory and not reversionary, as is that of a landlord, remainderman, and the like. Two pertinent facts of present interest and importan ce thus appear. The first is that a person whose interest was not reversionary was not permitted to recover f or injury to property unless he could show possession, actual or constructive. The second is but its corollary, to wit, that a title owner disseis ed could not sue his disseisor, for the latter’s acts of wrongdoing to the property as long as the disseisin continued. The disseisee in such case must either first regain possession by legal action or otherwise, and then bring his Action of Trespass for t he injury to the property, or recover for those injuries as an incident of his action to regain possession. He could not sue the disseisor for the tort independently until he had come into posses sion. . . - The substitution of our Prac tice Act for the Co mmon - Law System of Pleading has not changed the situation save as it has abolished certain formal distinc tions and employed a new nomenclature. The same facts will entitle one to the same redress as before, and to no other redress.” 12 It thus appears th at although there is a change, in name, substantively the require ments for bringing an Action under Modern Codes, Practice Acts or Rules of Court, which would be the equivalent of the Action of Tres pass, under the Common Law, are still the same. 12. 90 c oun. 570, 578, VS A. 135, 136 (1916).

The Statute of Westminster 11 (1285 ) authorized the Clerks in Chancery to issue New Writs in cases similar to, but not identical with, cases in which Writs had been previously issued. Various the ories have been advanced as to the effect of this Statute upon the development of the action of Trespass on the Case. Trespass and Case as the Source of Our Tort Law • AT Common Law civil injuries were divid ed into two kinds, the one without force or violence, such as deceit, libel and slander, or the detention of goods; the other, coupled with force and violence, such as assault and battery or false imprisonment. This distinc tion between private wrongs resulting from forcible injuries and those without force arose out of the Forms of Action or Reme dies which were available.

And it may be added that the modern theory of Tart Liability is the joint product of these two Actions. From the nucleus of violent wrongs, orig inally remediable alone by the Action of Trespass, remedies were extended to cover non - violent injuries under the great residu ary Action of Trespass on the Case, popular ly referred to merely as “Case.” The Ac tio n was not based on any distinct theory of wrong except the supplementary and exclu - sory one, covering all non - violent injuries, that is, those not falling within the theory of trespass. Case proceeded either by analogy to Trespass, where there was an indir ect ap plication of force, or on the general Common - Law principle of affording a remedy for every wrong, even though without violence, direct or indirect. There was and there is still no strict limit to thi s action and it is the vehicle which the Judges in England and America have used"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Page 189 of 735 in constantly expanding the Scope of Tort Liability 5 and in giving Negligence, 49 L,Q.Rev. 359 (1933); Landon, Case and Westminster Ii, 52 L.Q,Rev. 68 (19541); Phack ne tt, The Action on the Case and Westminster II, 52 L.Q.Bev. 220 (1936); Landon, The Action on the Case and the Statute of Westminster II, 52 L.Q.Rev. 68 (1026); Dix, The Origins of the Action of Tres pass on the Case, 441 ‘Yale U. 1142 (1937); harper, Malic ious Prosecution, False Imprisonment and Def amation, 15 Tex.L.Rev. 157 (1937); Iciralfy, The Humber Ferryman and the Action on the Case, 11 Camb.L.J. 421 (1953). 2.

It was formerly thought, that up until the Enactment of the Statute of West minster H in 1285, there was no Form of Ac tion or Origin al Writ which could be invoked to recover Damages for other or nonviolent injuries; that under this Statute the Action of Trespass on the Case arose under which any aggrieved party could sue for damages for any wrong to which Trespass would not apply; that the Action originated in the pow er given by the Statute to the Clerks in Chan cery to frame New Writs in consimili casu — that is, in cases similar to, but not identical with, cases in which Writs had been previous ly issued. This view of the Action of T respass on the Case, as being the product of the Statute of Westminster II (1285), has been placed in grave doubt by the latest research on the subject. Fifoot flatly declares that “The Ac tions on the Case derived, not from the stat utory powers of Chance ry Clerks, but from the Fiat of Judges.” ~ And those authori ties who agree with Fifoot, point out that when Case underwent its initial development the demand for a remedy developed the Action of Trespass on the Case as a General Specific in con simlU casu under the provisions of the Statute of Westmin ster II.’’ The learned judge simply was not conversant with the latest research in the field concerning the alleged re lationship of the Statute and the Action of Trespass on the Case. 3’ See 3 Street, Foundations of Legal Liability, c. xvIII, The Action of Trespass on the Case, 245 (Northport 1906). 4. Fifoot, History and Sources of the Common Law, c. IV, The Development of the Actions on the Case, 74 (London 1949). in the last third of the Fourteenth Century, it was founded, not upon Writs issued by the Clerks in Chancery, but upon Writs issued by the Judges under the broad authority of the Common Law, using the Action of Tres pass as the stock for grafting, as illus trated in The Miller’s Case ~ and The Innkeeper’s Case. 6 However this may be, the New Writs invented by the Judges to cover the cases were supposed to bear an analogy to Tres pass and hence received the appellation of Trespass on the Case (bi - evi.a de ti - a nsgres sione super casuin), as being grounded upon the particular circumstances of the case re quiring a remedy, and in order to distinguish them from the older and parent Action of Trespass; and likewise, for further differen tiation, the injuries themsel ves, which were the subject of such Writs, were not called “Trespasses,” but “Torts,” “Wrongs,” or “Grievances.” The Writs of Trespass on the Case, though invented pro re nata, in various forms, ac cording to the nature of the different wrongs which calle d them forth, began, neverthe less, to be viewed as constituting collectively a New Individual Form of Action. Accord ingly, this new genus took its place, under the name of “Trespass on the Case,” along side of the more ancient actions of Debt, Cov enant, Trespass and the like."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Page 190 of 735 In view of the Origin and Nature of this Action, it is important to note that it is com prised of several different species, two of which, however, are of more frequent use and of greater significance than any other, to wit, the Ac tion of Trover and the Action of Assumpsit, both of which developed out of Case, and were originally known as Tres - pass on the Case in Assumpsit and Trespass on the Case in Trover, but now referred to respectively simply as “Assumpsit” and 5.

The distinctions between wrongs which are included under Trespass and those under Case relate: (I) To the element of Force, Express or Implied, (II) Whether the injury is immediate or consequential on defendant’s act, (III) ‘Whether the liability is for Trespass es of defendant’s agents, (IV) Whether possession is interfered with. ALTHOUGH Case was complementary to Trespass, the two actions were to a certain extent mutually exclusive, 7 and in theory dis tinctly differe ntiated. Where the factual situation essential to constitute a trespass exists, as, for example, where the act was direct and wilful, the Action must be in Trespass. If, however, there was something else in the factual situation, such as neg ligence, the p laintiff might have an option as to Case or Trespass. And, of course, where any one of the elements required to constitute a trespass is wanting, the Remedy is in Case, assuming the facts make out a Torts Distinction Between Trespass and Case — In General AS we have already seen, where a Tort or Civil Wrong is committed with force, actual or implied, and the matter affected is tangi ble, as where the person or corporeal prop erty of another is affected, and the injury is immediate, and not merely consequent ial, and, in the case of injury to property, the property was in possession of the person 7. Day v. Edwards, 5 P.R. 648, 101 Eng.Rep. 361 (1794). complaining, the proper remedy to recover damages for the injury is the Aclion of Tres pass.° If, on the othe r hand, a Tort is com mitted without force, actual or implied, or if, though the Act was committed with force, the matter affected was not tangible, or the injury was not immediate, but consequential, or, in the case of injury to property, the plaintiff’s interest in the property was only in reversion, Trespass will not lie, and the proper remedy is Action on the Case.” The Element of Force UNLESS the case falls within one of the exceptions which we have already stated, and which will presently be explaine d more at length, an Action on the Case will not lie for an injury committed with force, but the party injured must sue in Trespass. Tres pass is excluded, however, if the harm re sulted indirectly from the act of the defend ant, or the injury was not to t he possession of the plaintiff. Force is either actual or implied. Assault and Battery, tearing down a fence, or break ing into a house are examples of actual force, and there is no difficulty in determining that Trespass, and not Case, is usually the only remedy.

Force, as we have seen, is implied in every Trespass Quare Clausum Fregit. If a man, without right, goes upon another’s land, however quietly and peaceable, the Law will imply force, and Trespass is the remedy, not Case; and the same is true where a man’s cattle stray upon another’s land. Force is also implied in every false imprisonment, and the proper remedy is Trespass, and not Case. And where a wife, daughter, or servant is debauched, or en ticed away, the Law implies force, notwith standing their consent, and the husband, par ent, or master may declare in Trespass.’ 1 And where a fire is started, and, as an im mediate consequence, another’s property is destroyed, there is constructive force .‘ - ~ G enerally, as we have seen, a mere non feasance cannot be regarded as forcible; for where there has been no act there can be no force. There is no force, for instance, in a mere detention of goods without an unlaw ful taking; or in neglect to repair the ban k of a stream, whereby another’s land is over flowed; ‘~ or in neglect to repair a fence whereby another’s animal escapes on to the land of the person so negligent or elsewhere, and is injured; ‘~ and in these instances Case, and not Trespass, must be the remedy. 11.

An injury is considered as immediate when the act com plained of, itself, and not merely a conse quence of that act, occasioned it. But where the damage or injury ensued, not directly from the act complained of, it is consequen tial or mediate, and cannot amount to a tres pass.’ 5 To take an illustration already used, if a person in the act of throwing a log into the highway hits and injures a passer - by, the injury is immediate, and trespass is the prop er re medy; but if, after a log has been thrown into the highway, some one in pass ing, falls over it, and is injured, the injury is consequential, and the Action must be in Case.’ 6 If a person forcibly takes another’s goods, the Action must generally be Trespa ss.

Sec. 86 TRESPASS ON THE CASE is’ injunction and an accounting is the usual remedy. If the injury is to corporeal property, and is immediate, and committed with force, case will not lie merely because that property was the means by which an incorporeal right was enjoyed. Thus, where, by Legislative Author ity, a dam has been erected and m aintained in a navigable river in connection with a mill, and the dam is wrongfully cut away by another, Case will not lie on the ground that an incorporeal right has been injured. “The ground on which the Form of Action was endeavored to be maintained,” i t was said in an Action on the Case for such a wrong, “was that the right to erect the dam, for an injury to which the action was brought, was a franchise, and incorporeal hereditament, and that for an injury to property, or right of that description, Tres pass tvill not lie. The principle here adverted to does not apply to the case. The right to erect the dam is a franchise; it is conferred by the legislature, the sovereign power; it is an incorporeal right, but the dam itself is not a franchise, nor is it incorporeal. The right to keep a ferry, or to erect a bridge, or to navigate a particular river or lake by steam, may be a franchise; but the bridge itself, or the boats and machinery employed in the ferry, or the navigation of the river, may, notwithstand ing, be the subjects of Trespass. ‘ * * So far as the incorporeal right is invaded, the re dress is by Action on the Case. But when Vis ible, tangible, corporeal property is injured, if the injury is direct, immediate and willful, Trespass is the proper F orm of Action, al though that property may be connected with, or be the means by which an incorporeal right is enjoyed.” ‘~ ELECTION BETWEEN TRESPASS AND CASE 86. When an injury results directly from a Negligent Act, the injured party has an Elec tion of Remedies. The injured party may main - tam an Action in Trespass, relying upon the fact that the injury resulted directly from the act; or he may maintain an"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Page 196 of 735 Action of Tres. pass on the Case relying upon the negligence as the basis for the action. WHILE Trespass and Case were designed to apply to different factual situations, as we have seen, there came a time in their de velopment, when the effort to distinguish the two actions on the basis of proximity, broke down, and it was realized that a singl e tort ious act might be at one and the same time a direct trespass and an injury resulting from negligence, actionable on the basis of a legal principle other than that effectuated by the Action of Trespass. Thus, in Dalton v. Favour, 46 where the plaintif f was wound ed by the accidental discharge of a gun held by the defendant, the wrong contained all the elements of Trespass. But looked at from another viewpoint, or with a fuller understanding of the facts, the act may be the foundation of another tort. I n such a situation the injured person sues in Trespass on the basis of a direct and forcible injury, or he may elect to treat the tort as the result of negligence in maneuvering the gun, and hence declare in Case. 4 ’ When, therefore, in Leame v. Bray, 48 the re was a collision, which was caused by negligence which combined facts of force, direct injury, as well as in fringement of possession there was clearly a Trespass. But the same factual situation might be treated as the consequences of an anterior tort, t o wit, the guilty party’s neg ligent driving, which might be regarded as a wrong of another species for which the remedy might be Case and not Trespass. It thus appears that the injured party has a choice of remedies, as was held in Williams 4°. 3 N.H. 46 5 (1826). 47. New York: Buns v. Campbell, 14 Johns. (N.Y.) 432 (1817); New Hampshire: Dalton v.

Holland, 49 according to the view he takes of the wrongdoer’s conduct; he may sue in Trespass for the forcible wrong, or make the negligence of the defendant the ground of his action and d eclare in Case. Other acts trespassatory in their character may be in jurious because of their indirect results, as in the case of the seduction of a man’s wife, or daughter, in which instance Case would be the proper remedy, the plaintiff making the conse quences of the act — the loss of services — the gist of his Complaint. 50 But clearly, the plaintiff - husband may elect to treat the direct injury to his wife or daughter as the basis of the action, in which case Trespass is the proper remedy. 5 ’ FORM OF THE DE CLARATION IN TRESPASS ON TUE CASE 87. As the action of Trespass on the Case was the Great Residuary Remedy of the Com mon Law, the forms in which it has found expression are as varied as the wrongs for which it has afforded a remedy.

The Essential Allegations in Actions of Trespass on the Case are: (I) The plaintiff’s Right, Title or Pos session; (II) The Facts showing the existence of a Legal Duty on the part of the de fendant; (III) A Wrongful Act by the defendant in Breach of his Duty; (IV) Damages proximately caused by the Wrongful Act. DECLARATION IN TRESPASS ON THE CASE — ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (2) THE PLAINTIFF’S RIGHT, TITLE, IN TEREST OR POSSESSION 89. In the case of injury to chattels, plain tiff’s right or interest in them is usually suff i ciently described by an averment that they are his goods and chattels, or that he was lawfully possessed of them as his own property. IN actions for injury to property, the plain tiff’s right or interest in the thing affected must be clearly stated. In the case of injury to chattels, the plaintiff’s right or interest in them will be ordinarily sufficiently described by an averment that they are his goods and chattels, or that he was lawfully possessed of them as his own property; but ‘ 1 if the plain tiff sues as a reversioner, he must either state an injury of such a permanent nature, as to be necessarily injurious to his reversion; or if the wrongful acts complained of are not of such a nature as necessarily to result in an"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Page 198 of 735 injury to the reversionary estate, but only of an equivocal character, the plaintiff must aver that they were done to the dam age, or prejudice of his reversion; and in the latter case, the want of such an averment, will be fatal on demurrer; or good cause for ar resting the judgment.” 52 Where the injury is to intangible personal rights such as reputation or incorporeal property rights, such as an easement and reversion, Case and not Trespass is the prop er remedy.

If, however, the right which is violated is that of personal security, this need not be stated. 56 It is usually neces sary to state somewhat fully the facts and circumstances showing the existence of a duty toward the plaintiff on the part of the defen dant, the neglect or breach of which would be an injury to the plaintiff. 57 Thus, in an action for negligent injury, it must appear that the plaintiff was in a situa tion where the defendant owed him a duty to exercise due care for his safety, as that the defendant was in control of machinery or other agency causing danger to the plain tiff, for which the defendant was responsible. A bare allegation that the defendant owed a legal duty to the plaintiff is a mere conclu sion of law and hence worthless; the facts creating the duty must be alleged, as that the relation of carrier and passenger exist ed. 55 The existence of the defendant’s duty 50.

The Court emphasizes the function of the Statement of Claim, which is the substitute for a Declaration, as the basis of a Judg meat, and the insufilcieney of the statement of clainr may be availed of on a Writ of Error even in t he’ absence of a Demurrer. 50 - A Declaration by an employee against a corpora tion, his employer, for injury by a grindstone burst ing should allege; (1) the relation, that plaintiff was in the employ of the defendant and was its servant, and was subject to its orders and direc tions in his work; (2) the duty of the defendant to furnish safe appliances and place to work; (3) the negligent acts of defendant hs permitting the rind stone to he and remain in a dangerous condition, showing how it was defective and why dangerous, and that defendant knew or ought to have known of the defects; (4) the causal connection between the negligence and the injury; (5) the due care of the plaintiff (in some Jurisdictions) and the fact that plaintiff did not know of the danger and was not chargeable with knowledge of It; (6) the damages.

IN Declarations in Trespass, the injury is stated without any averme nt of the defend ant’s motive or intent or of the circumstances under which it was committed. In general, in actions on the case, it is necessary to state, not only the wrongful act complained of, but also the wrongful intent, fraud, or negli gence with wh ich it was done and the cir - cumstances showing that it was wrongful. In some actions the scienter (knowledge) must be alleged and proved, as of the vicious propensity of the dog in an action for keeping a dog accustomed to bite people or sheep. But in an a ction for debauching a wife or servant it is not necessary to allege or prove that the defendant knew that the female was the wife or servant of the plaintiff. In actions for negligence there is some conflict whether a general charge of negli ge nce, as that defendant so negligently and carelessly operated a car that plaintiff was thrown from the car and injured, is suffi cient, or whether the facts and circumstances - showing negligence must be stated specifical ly. 6 ° When it is said that it is su fficient to"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Page 200 of 735 ~O.

A mere general aver ment of negligence is insufficient. 6 ’ In the case of a passenger injured in a street car collision, it will be sufficient for the declaration to show that the plaintiff was a passenger upon defendant’s car, that de fendant was a common carrier, and that de fendant failed to perform its duty to carry safely, by permitting the car to collide with another of defendant’s cars. It will not be necessary to plead the facts showing the cause of the collision, as the facts alleged bring the case within the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, 62 and an allegation of negli gence is unnecessary. 61 61.

Sec. 93 189 190 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Cli. 8 against a tenant for permissive waste (that is, a neglect to repair), there is a conflict of opinion. It seems that it does not lie, and that the only remedy is on the covenants in the lease. 85 Injury to a Lien IN the New York case of Yates v. Joyce, 8 ° the plaintiff, A, alleged that he, as assignee of a Judgment from one K against J, which was a lien on the property of J, was about to take out Execution and seize a certain lot of land; that the defendant, B, well knowing the premises and intending to injure the plaintiff, and prevent him having satisfaction, tore down a barn on the premises worth $300, leaving the ground of less value than the plaintiff’s judgment; and that J, being in solvent, had no other property with which to satisfy the Judgment. The defendant De murred, and on the argument contended that the plaintiff, having a mere lien only, and not being in posses sion could not maintain any action against the defendant, who is answerable only to the person in possession, and that there was no precedent for such an action. The Court, in overruling the defendant’s Demurrer, declared: “This appears to be an action of the first impression. The books do not furnish a precedent in its favor. It is obvious, however, from the statement of the plaintiff’s case, in the Declaration the truth of which is admitted by the Demurrer, that he has sustained damage by the act of the defendant, which he alleges was done fraudulently, and with intent to injure him. It is the pride of the Common Law, that wherever it recognizes or creates a private 85. Gibson v. Wells, 1 Bos. & P. (N.H.) 290, 127 Eng. Rep. 473 (1805); Herne v.

The facts stated in the Dec laration being admitted by the Demurrer, we are to assume that the plaintiff had acquired a legal lien on the property, by means of the Judgment in favor of Kane, and the assign m ent of it to himself; and that the injury to the property was done with a full know! edge of the plaintiff’s rights. If, then, there is any remedy for him, it is in this Form of Action only that he can obtain it. Trespass will not lie; for the plaintiff wa s not in pos session. The principle which governed the decision in the case of Smith v. Tonstall, (Carth. 3; 13 Vin.Abr. 553) is somewhat analogous. It was there ruled that an action will lie against the defendant for confessing a Judgment by fraud, in ord er to pi’event the plaintiff from having the benefit of a Judg ment he had obtained against him. It is sound principle, that where the fraudulent misconduct of a party occasions an injury to the private rights of another, he shall be re sponsible in damage s for the same; and such is the case presented by the pleadings in this cause.” ~ Injury to Reversionary interest TRESPASS quase clausum fregit may be maintained by the owner of land for an in jury to his freehold where it is in the occupa tion of a tenant at will. 88 This doctrine was not extended so as to apply to a remainder - man who was not entitled to possession.

Pesked, 9 ’ is that where the plaintiff sues as a reversioner, he must either stat e an injury of such a permanent nature as to be necessarily injurious to his reversion; or if the wrongful acts complained of are not of such a character as necessarily to result in an injury to the reversionary es tate, but only of an equivocal nature, th e plaintiff must allege that they were done to the damage or prejudice of his reversion; and in the latter case, the lack of such an allegation, will be fatal on demurrer; or good cause for arresting the judgment.° 2 injury to Freehold by Tenant at Will AT Common Law, a landlord, in order to maintain Trespass, must have been in actual possession of the premises at the time the trespass occurred.° 3 And he had no Remedy in Waste against a tenant at will. 94 In this situation it has usually been said that the w rongful act of the tenant at will terminat ed the tenancy, restored the possession to the landlord, who could then maintain an Action of Trespass. Actually there was no direct forcible invasion of the landlord’s possession; in fact the tenant had possessio n by legal means.

Thus Trespass, Case not being in existence when the problem first ar ose, was stretched beyond all semblance of its original theory. to cover what was in fact an indirect, conse quential injury to the landlord’s interest. And the proof of this is that when Case came in, it was said in West v. Treude °~ that the landlord mig ht have either an Action on the Case or Trespass against a tenant at will. In time however Trespass ceased to be used and the accepted remedy became an Action on the Case in the Nature of Waste. Seduction of Another Man’s Daughter, Wife or Servant WHEN th e demand for a remedy arose for the seduction or debauching of another’s daughter, wife or servant, the first remedy given by the Common Law was Trespass vi et armis, the law implying force, thus en abling the father, husband or servant to sue in that action. 96 Here again the injury was an indirect consequential one, and here, again, as in the tenant at will case, Trespass was commandeered to supply a remedy, Case not yet being available. By resort to a fic tion, the courts treated the daughter as the servant of the master, who thus acquired a possessory interest. Seduction was an inter - ference with such possessory interest, result ing in damage, for which Trespass thus be came a remedy, When Case came in, it was utilized as a remedy for what was clearly an indirect consequential injury, not an in jury to the possession of the husband, par - 95 - CroCar. 187, 79 Eng.Rep. 764 (1630)."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Page 207 of 735 98. ~ v.

Hazlewoodj’ 7 we find the plaintiff bringing Case for the consequential damage. In such case he may now, at his election, treat the loss of society or services, and not the defendant’s act of seduction, as the injury, and, as that is merely consequential, sue in Case.° 8 The order of development is illustrated by two New York cases; in the first, Alcerley v. Haines, 9~ decided in the year 1805, Trespass was held to be the proper remedy for the seduction of a daughter, whereas, in the sec ond, Moran v. Dawes, 1 decided just twenty years later, in 1825, the Supreme Court of the State sustained Case, declaring: “It is clear, we think, both upon principle and au thority, that Case, is, without exception, a proper remedy. (SeIw. N. P. 1083, note (17) cites 2 T.R. 167 , 8, per Euller, 3., and per Holt, C. J., Ld. Raym. 1032.) Neither the injury to the person of the child nor the property of the plaintiff are, in truth, ever taken into the account. They are little more than a mere fiction, adopted in order to sus tain th e Remedy by Trespass. The direct injury may be waived in all cases; and the declaration framed to meet the consequen tial injury, disregarding entirely every con - sideration except the loss of service, and the more important one of seduction and dis grace. A very usual case may be supposed, in which, if we are to be governed by the technical rules relating to an Action of Tres pass, the father would be remediless for the most aggravated form of the injury, unless he has an election. The seducer is received a t the dwelling of the father on the footing of a suitor; he thus having a license to enter the house, of which he avails himself to ac complish the seduction, with the consent of 97. 5 Mees. & W. 515, 151 Eng.Rep. 218 (1839~. 98.

It could hardly be said that Trespass and Assault would lie for such an act, The father is then put to his remedy by Trespass quare domum fregit, laying the seduction, &c., by way of aggravation. The defendant does not become a trespasser ab initio, for license was given by the party. A person who is guilty of abusing an authority in fact, does not thereby become a trespasser ab initio; but it is ot herwise where a license is given by the law.” 2 Actions Against the Master for Injuries Oc casioned by the Wrong of the Servant — Vicarious LiaNlity THE relation of master and servant was and is contractual in nature. Once the rela tionship was est ablished obligations accrued on both sides. The master was under a duty to provide a safe place to work, to provide safe appliances and equipment, to warn the servant of dangerous conditions on the prem ises, to provide suitable and competent fel low serva nts, and to make reasonable rules to regulate the conduct of the work. On the other hand the servant was required to exer cise reasonable care for his own safety and in the exercise of his duties within the scope of his employment. And it is important to o bserve that once the master - servant rela tionship is established, the master may be subjected to vicarious liability for the serv ant’s torts, although the master is free of any wrongful conduct. 3 Such liability has to do with those acts so closely related with what the servant was employed to do, and which were reasonably incidental to it, as they could be viewed as methods, although of questionable validity, of carrying out the master’ s instructions. As to what acts are authorized, depends upon the time, place and purpose of the act, together with its similar ity to the acts authorized. And in 1834, In 2. 4 Cow. (N.Y.) 412, 418 (1825). ~.

Comparatively re cently a case 11 of novel impression was con sidered involving the issue as to whether a wife could maintain an action under New Jersey law against the defendant for “mali ciously e nticing away the plaintiff’s hus - band, and thereby alienating from her his affections.” It appeared that the Common - Law impediment as to remedy had been re moved by a statute permitting a married woman to maintain an action in her own name, without joining her husband therein, for all torts committed against her or her separate property, in the same manner as if she were a feme sole. 12 In sustaining the wife’s action, Minturn, J., after alluding to the earlier, but incorrect view as to the origin of Case out of the Statute of Westmin ster II (1285),” concluded that the wife was entitled to vindicate her right in personam for a tort committed against her, and thus remedy the inequality to which she was sub jected by the common law.

In case for malicious prosecuti on, the Dec laration must show that the original prose ed was a pretence, and that the plaintiff was falsely and fraudulently deceived by It, is not suthcient, ei ther in Criminal or Civil Cases, to fasten upon such matter the character of a false pretence , and that this can he done in no other way than by a distinct and specific averment of the falsehood of each sep arate matter of fact stated by the defendant, and intended to be denied by the plaintiff.

Slander and Libel (I) Strictness of Common - Law Pleading in Defamation Cases Explained. — The re quirements of Common - Law Pleading ar e OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS strict and technical in regard to Declarations for Slander and Libel. This was true because the idea of defamation originated in the Civil Law, coming into English law through the Ecclesiastical or Church Courts, and hence the allawan ce of a remedy at Common Law for such actions invoked the rule of strict construction in pleading such causes. It was for this reason, that in declaring on contracts or other written instruments, the General Common Law Rule that the pleadcr night set out the instrument or writing verbatim, or according to its legal effect, was inap - plicable as to libel and slander cases; the li bel or slander had to be set forth verbatirn.~° This rule, first adopted in England by the Criminal Cour t of Appeal was in time as similated by the Civil Courts, and hence passed on down to modern time. The rea son for this rule was that the Appellate Court could not tell whether the Lower Court had ruled correctly that the words spoken or writ ten constitut ed libel or slander, as a matter of law, without having the very words as used in the Criminal Indictment before it. It was therefore required that the very words complained of be set out “in order that the court may judge whether they constitute a ground of action and also because the defend ant is entitled to know the precise charge against him and cannot shape his ease until he knows.” 21 (IT) The Characteristics and Form of the Declaration in Slander. — Eecause the Com mon - Law Courts regarded libel and slander ZO. In declaring on Contracts or other Written In struments the genus Common Law Rule is that the pleader must set out the Instrument sued upon verbatim, or in the words in which they were made, or according to their legal effect 1 Chltty, A Trea tise on PleadIng, 229 (Springfield, 1833). To this General Rule there were two exceptions, to wit, in cases involving Negotiable Instruments and In Libel and Slander cases, the original Common Law Rule being that in such eases the words bad to be set out v erbatim. It has, of course, been modified. U. Webster v. Rolmen, 62 N.S.L. 55, 40 A. 719 (1898). actions as an innovation, and applied the rule of strict construction in pleading such actions, it is no surprise to find that the Dec laration in slander at C ommon Law consists of an elaborate and absurd jargon of recitals and explanations which obscure the real is sues to be tried almost as effectually as if the pleadings were still drawn in Latin, as will appear from the form set out below: DECLARATION IN 22 TEES THE CASE FOR SLANDER IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY To the October Term, A.D. 1926 COUNTY OF COOK, ~ s SPATE OF ILLINOIS, Arthur Brown, by William Jolm son, his attorney, complains of Clar ence flowell, defendant, who has been summoned to answer the plain tiff in a plea of trespass on the case for slander.

S clearly apply to the plaintiff, a colloquium is not necessary. In Milligan v. Thorn, 25 the plaintiff complained that he had been slan dered, but he was not named in the slander ous words, The plaintiff therefore was re quired to include a colloquium, that a con versatio n was had of and concerning him. Without this nothing was expressed to which the innuendo could refer, when the plaintiff stated that he was intended. 2 ° (C) The Publication of the Scandal Itself. — As the basis of actions for libel and slander is damages f or the injury to the character of the plaintiff in the opinion of others, and that can only arise where the words uttered or written are published to third persons, the declaration must allege publication of the slanderous or libelous matter. Thus, for 25 . 6 Wend. (N.Y.) 412 (1581). ~6. Where Defamatory language Is of a clear import and on its face applies to the plaintiff, no colloqul urn or setting is necessary in the Declaration. Choc taw Coal & Mining Co. v. LulIch, 204 Ala. 533, 56 South. 383, 11 ALa . 358; 17 R.C.L. 394. “Thus, if the imputation be that the plaintiff was ‘fore sworn,’ this not being of itself actionable, because it does not necessarily impute the offense of perjury, it must be specifically alleged, by way of Induce ment, that there ha d been a Judicial Proceeding, in which the plaintiff was a witness and gave evidence, and that the defendant when speaking the words, referred to such matter in using tho term ‘fore sworn,’ and Intended to Impute that the plaintiff bad been guilty of the c rime of perjury.” I Chitty, Pleading, 415. “Where the libelous matter can be collected from the words themselves, there need be no averment as to circumstances.” Thus, if the Declaration be, “lie perjured himself,” the charge of crime appears, and it Is fo r the defendant to plead its truth If he can. A Declaration was sus tained by the King’s Beuch in 1661 as against a Mo tion in Arrest of Judgment which chnrged the de fendant with saying of plaintiff, an attorney, “lie has no more Judgment in the Law than Mastcr Cheyny’s bull,” although it was urged that the Dcc’ laration was defective In not alleging that Mr. Chey ny bad a bull, ned, non allocatur. Baker v Morphew, 2 Keble, 202, 84 Eng.Rep. 126. A charge, ironically made, that the plaintiff was an ‘ton cut lawyer,” would have required more explana tion, See Keigwlu, Precedents of PleadIng, 285, 295 (WashIngton, I). C. 1928). example, in Waistel v. Holman, 2 ’ where the declaration averred that the defendant com posed, wrote and delivered to the plaintiff a certain libel, addressed and directed to the plaintiff, a Demurrer was sustained, as the averment failed t 0 show a publication of the libel; sending a sealed letter to the plaintiff was not a publication. (D) The Innuendo. — This part of the Declaration followed the colloquium, and its object was to explain the"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Page 214 of 735 defendant’s mean ing by reference to the previous statements in the inducement and colloquium; but an in nuendo cannot enlarge the meaning shown by the in ducement in which the surrounding conditions are set forth. 28 In Roella v. Fol low, 29 the colloquium stated that “He” (meaning the plaintiff) “took a false oath,” but the Court held that the Declaration was inadequate in that the words were not in themselv es actionable, and require an “innu endo which is necessary, in such cases, to ex plain the defendant’s meaning by reference to previous matter.” (E) The Consequent Dantage& — This was merely a conclusion of the plaintiff that he had sustained damages to a certain amount, and therefore, he brings his suit.

Clii’ See. 93 TRESPASS ON TIlE CASE 199 and Slander, states: “So, too, many other allegations were required describing the lo cality, the relationship between the various persons mentioned, and all the surrounding circumstances necessary to fully understand the defendant’s words. And these matters could not properly be proved at t he trial unless they were set out on the record; if they were not, and the plaintiff had a verdict, the court would subsequently arrest judg ment on the ground that it did not appear clearly on the face of the record that the words were actionable. And thi s technicality was carried to an absurd extent. Thus, where the defendant said, ‘Thou art a mur derer, for thou art the fellow that dklst kill Mr. Sydnam’s man,’ the court of Exchequer Chamber, on error brought, arrested judg ment, because there was no ave rment that any man of Mr. Sydnam’s had in fact been kille& 31 Had the words been ‘and thou art’, instead of ‘for thou art,’ the plaintiff would probably have been allowed to recover, Again, in Ball v. Roane (1598) Cro.Eliz, 308, the words were: ‘There was n ever a robbery committed within forty miles of Wellingborough but thou hadst thy part in it.’ After a verdict for the plaintiff, the court arrested judgment, ‘because it was not averred there was any robbery committed within forty miles, etc., for otherwis e it is no slander.’ So in Foster v. Browning (1625) Cro.Jac. 688, where the words were, ‘Thou art as arrant a thief as any is in England,’ the court arrested judgment ‘because the plaintiff had not averred that there was any thief in England.’ But the cli max was reach ed in a case cited in Dacy v. Clinch (1661) 1 Sid. 53, where the defendant had said to the plaintiff, ‘As sure as God governs the world, or Icing James this kingdom, you are a thief,’ After verdict for the plaintiff, the defendant moved in ar rest of judgment, on cago, 1724); Kcigwin, Precedents in Pleading, 285 ~Washlngton, I).

But here the Court drew the line, and held that ‘these things were so apparent’ that neither of them need be averred.” (F) The Defamatory Words Themselves Must be Set Out Verbcttim. — At Common Law, the gene ral rule was that in suing on written instruments, the contract could be set out verbatim or according to its legal effect. As setting forth a writing verbatim often resulted in a motion for nonsuit on the ground of variance between allegation and proof, u sually the writing was set out according to its legal effect. But in libel and slander cases the words had to be"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Page 215 of 735 alleged verbatim, or in haec verba. 32 As we have stated earlier, this was due to the civil law origin of libel and slander, both of which were regarded as innovations upon the Com mon Law, and to the fact that the criminal and Appellate Courts, on review, could not determine whether the lower courts had properly determined whether the words ut tered or written, as a matter of law, were slanderous or libelous. The defendant, of course, was also entitled to know the precise charge against him. 33 32. Webster ‘cc flolmes, 82 N.J.L. 55, 40 A. 778 (18985. See, also, Wormouth V. Cramer, S wend. (N.Y.) 394 (1829), where the words uttered were in the Germ an language, but were set forth in the Declaration in the English language, with the rcsult that the plain tiff was Nonsuited. Proof of similar or equivalent words is not admissi ble. Wallace ‘cc Dixon, 82 Dl. 202 (1876); Schultz ‘cc Short, 201 ill.App. 7 4 (19Th). But a slight vari ance Is not fatal; i. e., “You are a lIar” is support ed by proof that “You are a damned liar.” 25 Cyc. 472. 33. “The gravamen of an action for libel is not in jury to th e plaintiffs feelings, but damage to his reputation in the eyes of others. It Is not sufficient, therefore, that the plaintIff should understand him self to be referred to in the article. It is necessary to constitute libel that others than the plaintiff s hould he in a position to understand that the plain tiff Is the person referred to.” Duvivier v, French, 104 Fed. 278, 43 C.C.A. 529 (1900). 200 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 8 (G) The Technical Common - Law kules of Pleading in Libel and Slander Modified. — Under modern practice the technicalities governing pleading in libel and slander eases have been largely abandoned. This tendency first took on substantial form in England when the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852 ~ provided: “In Actions of libel and slander, t he plaintiff shall be at liberty to aver that the words or matter cornplainedof were used in a defama tory sense, specifying such defamatory sense without any prefatory averment to show how such words or matter were used in that sense, and such averment sh all be put in issue by the denial of the alleged libel or slander; and where the words or matter set forth, with or without the alleged meaning, show a cause of action, the Declaration shall be sufficient.” This section was adopted into the New Jersey sta tutes in 1855.~~ The purpose of the above provision, as ex pounded by the courts of England and New Jersey, was to afford the plaintiff the right to set out in his Declaration the words com plained of, and to place upon those words, by innuendo or specified defamatory sense, any construction he may see fit to attribute to them, without showing, by means of a colloquium, or other explanatory matter, how the words contained a defamatory charge. 35 “The effect of this change,” according to Lanning, 3., in Allen v. Oppenheimer, 37 “in the law of pleading, as to this class of cases, is that if the words complained of are action able per se, and the plaintiff by innuendo puts a const ruction upon them different from what they would mean without the innuendo 34. 15 and 10 Wet. e. 76, § 61, 02 Statutes at Large 208 (1852). 35.

Such was the con elusion reached in Watkin v. Hall, L.R. 3 Q.B. 396, and in view of the last clause of the section the conclusion seems to be sound.” ~ And in some states, such as New York, in an action for slander brought by a woman impu ting unchastity to her, it is not neces sary to allege or prove special damages. 3 ° Neglect of Official Duty CASE is a proper remedy against an officer"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Page 216 of 735 for failure to perform his duty, whereby the plaintiff has sustained an injury (though an action ex contractu on his bond may be a concurrent remedy), as, for not Levying an Execution, or for not returning it, or for not taking a Replevin Bond, or for taking an insufficient bond, etc.; 4° and it will lie against an officer for making a False Re - turn; 41 or against an election officer for 33 - “At Common Law the pleading of a plaintiff in a slander suit, contained, when necessary, what was known as an ‘Inducement’, a ‘Colloquium’, and an ‘Innuendo’, The peculiar office of these separate di vision s of the Pleading was distinctly circumscribed, but in more Modern Tunes, when the Technical Rules of Common - Law Pleading have been super seded by the enactment of Codes of Practice, the extreme Common - Law Technical Rules with respect to Pleadings in Libel and Slander Cases have been largely modified, so that now, if a Pleading con tains the necessary Allegations, whether they be found in that part of it appropriately styled the ‘Inducement,’ the ‘Colloquium’, or the ‘Innuendo’, it will be sufficient althou gh not contained In that par ticular division where the Rules of the Common - Law required it to be.” Thomas, J., in Castineau ‘cc Mccoy, 100 Ky. 463, 465, 227 SW. 801, 802 (1921). 39.

In some Jurisdictions the plaintiff must negative the possible existence of certain tech nical defenses, viz, contributory negligence, fellow - servant rule, and assumption of risk. IN some Jurisdictions it is necessary in a Declaration for negligence by a servant against the employer to negative the de fenses of contributory negligence, fellow - servant rule, a nd assumption of risk. In Caluinet Iron and Steel Company v. Martin, 5 ’ the general rule is declared to be that, in order to recover for injuries from negligence, it must be alleged and proved that the plain tiff was, at the time he was injured, observ ing ordinary care for his personal safety. After the period of the statute of limitations, the declaration cannot be amended to supply this “substantial fact.” 52 In an Action of Trespass on the Case by a servant against his employer a Declaration was defectiv e in Illinois and some other states which did not negative knowledge or assumption of risk. 53 It has been held that negativing knowledge of the risk is insufficient as it does not appear but that the servant had easy means of knowing. 5 ’ In an action by a servant against his em ployer to recover for a personal injury for negligence, the declaration must negative the defense of the fellow - servant rule, if it is alleged that the negligent acts were done by the servants of the defendant witho ut showing to what class they belonged. It is held, however, that if the allegations indicate 51. 115 III. 358, 3 N.E. 456 (1885). 52. Walters v. City of Ottawa, 240 Ill. 259, 266, 88 N.

Since the plaintiff comes into court asking relief, it might seem that logically he should be re quired to set up and prove all the conditions essential to recovery, and that he should negative all possible defenses, such as con - tributory negligence, assumption of risk, and fellow - servant rule. In fact, however, the plaintiff is ordinarily only required to make out a prima facie case and need not refer to all the conditions, positive and negative, which are u ltimately essential to a recovery. The plaintiff must show an apparent reason for his request and give fair notice of the facts relied on as the basis of his claim. This will, in general, indicate as to what matters the plaintiff has the burden of proof, w hich is a question of fairness, policy and conveni ence. Matters of justification and excuse are for the defendant to prove, since it is unfair to require the plaintiff to disprove the existence of each and all of them, 56 The defenses of contributory negli gence, assump tion of risk, and fellow - servant rule are tech nical at best and should not be favored by the rules of pleading. If they are to be raised at all, they should be set up affirmatively by the defendant. 55. Illinois: Libby, McNeill & Libby v.

The Action of Trespass on the Case was adapted to many circumstances and factual situations which characterized the growth of society, and the ability of the law to meet the demands of a constantly advancing civilization largely has been made possible by the expansion istic character of this actzon. IT Is impossible to enumerate all the fac tual situations in which an Action of Tres pass on the Case can be maintained, hence the particular applications of the action above discussed are merely illustrati ve of its enor mous scope. It is referred to as the Great Residuary Remedy of the Common Law for the reason that the law has never placed a limitation on its continual expansion. As we have seen it was largely through the con stant and ever increasing appl ication of this action to a myriad of different factual situa tions involving a wrong not remediable by any other Form of Action which enabled the Judges of England to build up the Common Law of that country as it is known today. Before modern research re vealed that Case did not originate out of the Statute of West minster 11 (1285),~~ it was often suggested that a liberal construction of that Statute would have eliminated any need for the Chancellor’s extraordinary jurisdiction in fill ing out the alleged deficiencies of the Com mon Law, This suggestion was predicated upon the view that Equity originated out of the failure of the Common Law Courts to adapt themselves to the changes and needs of a developing society. It is submitted, how ever, that the view that Equity originated out of a failure of the Common Law Courts to so adapt themselves is wholly untenable and contrary to fact, for, as has been ob served, the Common Law Courts could in no WI. Fifoot, ~istory and Sources of the Common Law, e. Iv, The Development of Actions on the Case, 66 — 78 (London, 1940). event have afforded the kind of relief which Equity was eventually to offer without com pletely revolutionizing their procedures and enlarging their jurisdiction."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Page 219 of 735 What is true, however, is that th e Action of Trespass on the Case revealed such great potentialities as to permit its adaptability to the many circumstances and factual situa tions which have characterized the growth of our society. Indeed, the ability of our law to meet the demands of ou r constantly advancing civilization largely has been made possible by the expansionistic character of this action. And, in this connection, it should be remembered that the capacity of this action has not been destroyed by the Re formed Procedure, under wh ich the Single Action provided is in the Nature of an Action on the Case, and hence the process of ex pansion and growth continues at full pace. STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES OF COURT 96. The Common Law Action of Trespass on the Case continues to exist under modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court, al though the label, as such, has been removed. TI - fE Modem Status of the Action of Tres pass on the Case appears plainly from two cases, one decided in l939,~ the other in 1951.~~ In the first case, Williamson v. Columbia Gas d Electric Cor’poration, 6 ° in which the plaintiff complained that the acts of The Columbia Gas & Electric Corporation were in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 6 ’ the section which barred co rporations from acquiring, directly or indirectly, any stock of another corporation engaged in commerce, 58.

S where the effect would be to substantially lessen competition, the plaintiff also claimed threefold damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act.° 2 The defendant moved to dis miss the complain t, on the ground that it did not state a cause of action which accrued within a period of three years prior to the Commencement of the Action. It was stip - ulated that the right of action accrued not later than January 1, 1931. The complaint having been dis missed by the District Court, the plaintiff appealed, thus raising a question as to whether the plaintiff’s action was bar red under the applicable Delaware Statute of Limitations,° 3 Section 5129 of which pro vided: “No Action of Trespass, no Action of Rep leviri, no Action of Detinue, no Action of Debt not found upon a Record or Special ty, no Action of Account, no Action of As sumpsit, and no Action upon the Case shall be brought after the expiration of three years from the accruing of the cause of such ac tion.” In this situation the plaintiff concluded his action was in the nature of an Action of Debt on a Specialty and hence was not barred, having been brought within twenty years, the period prescribed by the Statute. The de fendant argued that the comp laint set forth a cause in tort for which an Action on the Case was the only remedy and that since the suit was brought more than three years after the action had accrued, recovery was barred by the Statute. Thus, in the Appeal, the is sue of law was wheth er an Action in the Nature of Debt on a Specialty at Common Law might be brought to recover Damages for injuries to business resulting from acts prohibited by Section 7 of the Clayton Act; or whether an action in the Nature of the Common Law Action of Tres pass on the Case was the sole remedy of the aggrieved party. 62. 15 U.S.C. 15, 15 U.S.C.A. § 15. In affirming the Order of the District Court, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the action sounded in tort and that the appro priate Form of Action was the Common Law Action of Trespass on the Case. Chief Jus tice Mans declared:"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Page 220 of 735 “In order to apply a stat ute of limitations, such as that of Delaware, which reads in terms of Common Law Ac tions, to a Civil Action brought in a Distr ict Court, it is necessary for the court through a consideration of the nature of the Cause of Action disclosed in the complaint to deter mine the Form of Action which would have been brought upon it at Common Law. It is evident that the complaint in the c ase before us discloses a Cause of Action which, under the Common Law of Delaware, would be en forceable in an Action on the Case and not in an Action of Debt on a Specialty. The Dis trict Court, therefore, properly held that the action was barred by the D elaware Stat ute of Limitations.” In the second case, Ei.sener v. Maxwell,” a Canadian case decided in 1951, the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim alleged Damages caused by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle on a highway, to which the defendant plead ed that there had been no negligence. The Statute of Limitations for batteries was one year, and for causes which formerly would have been brought in the Form of Action Known as Trespass on the Case, six years. At the Trial the defendant urged that an action for personal injury was an Action I or Assault and Battery, and since it was brought after the expiration of one year, was barred by the Statute of Limitations. The plaintiff contended that automobile collisions on the highway should be treated as A ctions of Neg ligence, and hence should be regarded as within the class which formerly would have been brought in the Form of Action called 03. Revised Code of Delaware (1935). 04. 28 !‘Ll’.ttep. 213 (1051). TRESPASS ON THE CASE Trespass on the Case, and, therefore, was not barred, as it fell within the purview of that Section of the Statute of Limitations which prescribed a six year period of limita tions. The Lower Court held for the defend ant, but on Appeal, it was held that automo bile collisions on th e highway should be treat ed as giving rise to a new right of action to be known as an Action of Negligence. As such, it fell within the class which formerly would have been brought in the Form of Action Known as Trespass on the Case, and hence the six yea r Statute of Limitations ap plied. Thus, from the standpoint of a Federal case, decided in 1939, or a Canadian case, decided in 1951, It clearly appears that the Common Law Action of Trespass on the Case is very much alive under Modern Codes, Practice Act s, and Rules of Court, even though the label, as such, has been removed; and, what is more significant, is showing sufficient strength to create new substantive rights of action.

The injury lies in the conversion or misappropriation of the goods, which is the gist of the action, and the state ment of the finding is neither material nor traversable. 3 The object of the action is not the recovery of the property itself — that can be recovered only by Detinue or Replevin — but to recover the value of the property.

The manner in which the defendant may have obtained possession of the property is no longer material. The Form of the Action supposes that the possession may have been obtained lawfully, that is, by a bailment or a fin ding, but it lies as well where the posses sion was obtained by a Trespass. In such a case, however, the plaintiff, by bringing Trover, waives the Trespass; and no Dam ages are recoverable for the act of taking; they are recoverable only for the wrongful a ct of conversion. 6 PROPERTY WHICH MAY BE CONVERTED 98. Trover may be maintained for all kinds of personal property, including legal documents, but not where articles are severed from land by an adverse possessor, at least until after tIre land has been recovered, It lies for the misappropriation of specific money, but not for the breach of an obligation to pay where there is no duty to return specific money.

Each of these remedies had their own peculiar characteristics and Trover was not com pletely coextensive with them. THE Action of Detinue, in its broadest scope, and the Action of Trespass failed to adequately protect the rights of owners in their chattels. Thus, if a bailee or other per son in possession misused the goods of the bailor i n such a way as to impair their value, and thereafter, at the request of the bailor, surrendered them, the only remedy available to the bailor was an Action on the Case, if he desired to recover full Damages.’° Of course, if, after diminishing the value of the chattels, the bailee still refused to deliver them upon the demand of the owner, Detinue was available, in which the owner might recover the chattels or their value, with Damages for the unlawful detention. But if the defendant saw fit to restore the chattels under the judgment and the owner wished to recover Damages for the injury or di minished value of the chattels, he was forced to bring Case. By bringing Case in the first instance, the owner w as able to avoid a mul tiplicity of actions. 2 ° Originally, where the chattel bailed found its way from the bailee 51 Am.Rep. 91 (1884); Brown v.

Whatever doubt prevailed on the point as to whether Case would lie in favor of the owner in this situation was ultimately resolved in favor of permitting the action. 2 ’ It having now been held that Case would lie against any posses sor for misusing the goods, and any possessor other than a bailee for the destruction of the goods, it was bound to follow that such an action would be permitted against a bailee who destroyed the goods, which occurred in a case decided in 1479.22 In a case decided in 1510 23 it was held that a wrongful sale by a bailee would amount to a conversion, and in Vancirinic v. Archer, 23 the same effect was given to a sale by a finder, as a result of which Trover became established as a con current remedy with Detinue in those cases involving a misfeasance. The next step was for Trover to become concurrent with Trespass. Basset v. RIay nard 25 held in the year 1601 that Trover would lie for a wrongful taking, and in 1604, in the case of Bishop v. Montague, 28 it was held that the plaintiff might elect between 2’. I.E. 12 Edw. iv, f. 13, p1. 9 (1472). 22. I.E. 18 Edw. IV, I, 28, p1. 5.

And i n 1596, in the case of Eason v. I’1ewman,~ Trover was permitted against a finder, even though the original taking was not adverse, on the ground of re fusal to surrender the goods on demand of the owner, it having been earlier held that Tres pass could be maintained as the taker was a trespasser ab initlo. Ames suggests, how ever, that the action was allowed as a sub stitute for Trespass, and not as an alternative of Detinue, a conclusion based on the fact that for many years thereafter Prover was not permi tted against a bailee who refused to deliver the chattel to the bailor upon request. But after various negative holdings, in 1675, it was held that Trover was available against the bailee on mere demand and denial. 28 Under the foregoing decisions, Trover b e came a concurrent remedy with Detinue, except where the bailee was unable to de liver the goods as they had been negligently lost; in such a case the bailee was liable in Assumpsit. The net result, therefore, was that Trover, not being subject to Wager o f Law, was substituted in lieu of Detinue, until after the early part of the Nineteenth Cen tury. One further conquest remained to be made, although Trover had now been extend ed to cover the Field of Both Detinue and Trespass. After Trespass became concur rent with Replevin, which lay for a wrongful dis tress, Prover followed suit and also became available on the theory that a wrongful dis tress constituted a conversion. 29 Thus, Trover had finally emerged as a remedy concurrent with Detinue, Replevin and Trespass, and supplemented by Case and Assumpsit. 27.

But it is generally recognized that “the peace and order of society require that per Sons in possession of property, even without Title, should be enabled to protect such pos - session by appropriate remedies against mere naked wrongdoer& 4~ ” Thus the United States Government, in carrying on the post office, is bailee of the letters and their con tents for hire, and has suf ficient interest to maintain an Action of Trespass or Trover against a thief or wrongdoer for disturbing that possession, like any other bailee, and may recover the entire value of the prop erty. 4 ° A person having a special property in goods, and being en titled to the possession as against the general owner, as in the case of a pledgee for value, a chattel mortgagee after condition broken, or a bailee having a lien, may maintain Trover even against the General Owner, or against one who has con verted the g oods by authority of, or on Proc ess against, the General Owner. 41 44 - Engel v.

Title in a Third Partij as a Defence IN Trespass and Trover at Common Law there was some difficulty as to whether Title in a Third Party was a good Defence. As Trespass is based on possession, the Defence of Title in a Third Person was obviously not good. But in Trpver the situation may be di fferent where the plaintiff, not being in possession,~° is relying on his right to posses - 59. Grant v. King, 14 Vt. 367 (1842). See, also, Turner V. Waldo, 40 Vt. 51 (1867). 00. If the plaintiff in Trover Is relying on possession, title in a third party may not be pleaded success - sion. In the latter case, the defendant may sometimes effectively take issue as in the case of Leake v. Loveday, 6 ’ in which A was the holder of a bill of sale upon furniture be longing to B, the effect of the bill being to leave the possession of the furniture in B, but to convey the ownership to A,, with a provision that if B failed to pay the money due under the bill, A should have an imme diate right to possession. B went into bank ruptcy, wher eupon the Title to the furniture, being still in his “order and disposition,” passed to his assignees in bankruptcy. Be fore the assignees could liquidate, the furni ture was seized on Execution, in satisfac tion of a debt which B owed to other credi tors. In this situation A, relying on his bill of sale, sued the defendant - sheriff, who took under the Execution, in Trover, only to be met with the Defence that Title was. in Third Parties — the assignees in bank ruptcy. In holding the Defence good, it was point ed out that since the plaintiff was not in possession he necessarily had to make out his right to immediate possession, and hence by Way of Defence the sheriff could plead the Superior Title of the assignees in bankruptcy, even though he was not acting und er their authority.

The Declaration should allege a Con version by the defendant to his own use, con trary to the Rght of the plaintiff, A Conver sion may be: (I) By wrongfully taking and carrying away goods, or assuming a dominion over them, or otherwise depriving the owner of them, (II) By wrongfully assuming the control, or dominion over, or right to dis pose of goods, of which the actual possession has been lawf ully ob tained. (III) By merely wrongfully Cetaining goods lawfully obtained. In this case, and in this case only, a de mand and refusal to restore the goods are necessary before bring ing the Action. A demand and refusal are not necessary to make a Conver sion where the defendant has already done an Act of Con version. The Nature of Conversion. A CONVERSION of the property is the gist of the Action of Trover, and is always essential to support it. It is for the conver sion of the goods by the defendant to his own use, not for the act of taking them, that Dam ages are recoverable. For the act of taking, the remedy is Trespass. To constitute a conversion, it is necessary that he shall have, in some sense, n,isappro priated or assumed adverse dominion over 65. Royce v. Oakes, 20 R.T. 252, 38 A. 371 (1897).

A conversion is not nec essary to support trespass, but it is neces sary to support Trover. A mere se izure of goods by a stranger, who immediately relin quishes possession, even though there was some asportation, will support Trespass, but not Trover, for there is no conversion. 69 If, by a mere seizure without a carrying away, the possession is changed in law, then there is a conversion. Trover will therefore lie where goods are wrongfully seized, as a dis tress, though there is no removal of them. 7 ° Trover lies to recover the value of goods obtained by the defendant from the p laintiff by fraud. Replevin will also lie. This in effect is the specific enforcement of the duty of the fraudulent buyer to return the goods and the corresponding right of the seller to immediate possession. 7 ’ (II) By a Wrongful User, or Assumption of Ti tle. - .. - .Again, the wrongful assumption of the property in goods, or dominion over them or right of disposing of them, may be a con version in itself, though actual possession may have been obtained lawfully, or not ob Janvrin, 41 N.H. 520, 77 Am.Dec. 780 (1800); Drew v.

The Declaration must state the Dam ages which are the legal and natural conse quence of the Conversion and the amount laid should cover the value of the goods and other actual Damages. THE amount of Damages which is recov erable in this action is usually measured by the value of the goods at the time of conver sion, with interest; °‘ but the plaintiff is en - tilled to include also any other loss that is its legal and naturai consequence, if not too remote, and the statement therefore should be large enough to cover the actual Damages inflict ed. 92 there may be a right to detain the goods, as where the party has a lien on them. The reason for the refusal, in such a case, should be stated. Kellogg s’. Holly, 29 III, 437 (1862). One in the possession of property may always claim a lien up on It, or he may have the right to satisfy himself, as any prudent man would do, that the party demanding it is the real owner, or the proper agent to receive it.

The plaintiff might recover Special Damages in Trover, if they were laid in the Declaration.

SCOPE OP THE ACTION 106. The Action of Ejeetment lies to recover possession of Real Property adversely held by the defendant. In order that the Action may be maintained: (I) The Plaintiff must have the right to possession at the time the Action commenced; prior possession is sufficient as against a mere intruder or trespasser. (II) The plaintiff must have been dis possessed or ousted. (III) And the defendant must be in the adverse and illegal possession of the land, actual or constructive, at the time the Action is brought. In the absence of a Statutory Provision to the contrary, merely Nominal Damages are giv en for the dispossession in the Action of Eject nient proper. The Mesne Profits, during the defendant’s possession, must be recovered at Common Law in a separate Action of Trespass for Mesne Profits, or by some similar remedy, In many Jurisdictions, by Statute, Mesne Proilts and other Da mages may be, and in some, must be recovered in the Action of Ejectment proper. 1.

To provide an adequate remedy for the holder of a Non - freehold Estate, the Action known as Trespass for Ejectment was devel oped. But at t his point, it should be pointed out that this Newly Developed Remedy was available only to the holder of a Non - free hold Estate, to wit, a tenant for years, who was regarded as having only a mere Chattel interest and not an interest in Real Estate; it was not available to vindicate the right of one who was asserting Title to a freehold in terest in land. If the plaintiff desired to try Title to the land in question, he was still re - quired to invoke one of the Ancient Real Actions, 5 which, as we have pointed out in an earlier chapter, were highly dilatory, ex pensive and unduly technical. 6 In the fifty to a hundred years after 1499, the year in which it was held that the tenant could recover the Term as well as Damages, this New Actio n of Trespass for Ejectment & Keigwin, Cases in Common Law Pleading, c. II, The Common Law Actions, The Action of Ejectmcnt, 123 (2d ed., Rochester 1934). ~ - These Actions, some sixty in number, arc discussed in Chapter 2, The Development of the Common L aw Forms of Action. & “The Common Law furnished an endless number of Real Writs to determine the rights of property in, or possession of, a freehold estate. The highest technical skill and learning were requisite to com prehend and define the nature and p urposes of these various writs, the distinctions between which were refined, abstruse and often scarcely perceptible. In Personal Actions, however, there were never many writs at Common Law. This very scarcity made personal actions attractive in early time s, the plead er being seldom at a loss to know which Writ to choose; while in Real Actions the most experienced practitioner, exercising the utmost care, frequently sued out a Real Writ of the wrong degree, class or nature, thereby rendering the proceeding of no avail, and frequently Imperilling the demandant’s right to the proper writ or remedy. Not only were the dis tinctions between Real Writs very technical, and the selection of the proper writ a delicate task, but became such an effective instrument fo r try ing the Right of Possession which, in sub stance, amounted to trying Title, that the landlords, who, in Legal Contemplation, al ready had an Adequate Remedy, in the Form of the Real Actions, 7 for the recovery of Pos session, began to seek ways and me ans whereby the New Remedy — now known as Ejectment — and open only to the holders of non — freehold estates, might be made avail able to the holders of freehold estates, with out violating the Common - Law theory that the remedy was available solely for the use o f non - freehold owners. This end was to be accomplished by work ing out a scheme whereby the Action of Tres pass Quare Ejectione F’irmae — Trespass for Ejectment — could be adapted to the use of the owners of freehold estates without vio lating the fundamental theory of the action — that it was available only to the owners of non - freehold interests in land. And it was the ensuing effort which ushered on to the stage of procedural legal history the law’s most famous fiction — the Fictitious Proceed ing in Ejectment — which did not reach full fruition except as an incident of passing through thrce stages of development:"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Page 244 of 735 First, wherein there was no fiction whatever in volved; second, where there was a resort to fiction, but wherein the steps upon which the fiction was g rounded were actually true in the proceedings under them were so inconveniently long, tedious and costly, and the resources for delay so numerous, that the Judgment when obtained was often a tardy and inadequate remedy.” Sedgwick and Wait, Principles and Practice Governing the Trial of Title to Land, c, I, ~ 2, p. 3 (New York, 1882). 7. The Common Law believed in an economy of rem edies. Where the Law supplied a remedy to a given group of litigants, like the owners of fr eehold es tates, they were generally limited to that remedy. When, therefore, the New Action of Trespass for Eiectment was created, there naturally followed a period of time during which the new remedy re mained unavailable to the holders of freehold es ta tes. 229 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Cli. 10 (I) Where the Requisite Conditions to Support Trespass Quare Ejectione Firmae were Actual. — Where A, a freeholder, actu ally leased I3lackacre to B, who took actual possession, and was thereafter disseised, B, the tenant, might bring an Action of Tres pass for Ejectment. C, the disseisor, usually defended by asserting a Title paramount to that of A, the lessor. Thus, the merits of B’s Title under A, and C’s title, were brought into opposition and comparison, as an in cident of B’s claim to a right of possession. The Judgment which followed necessarily determined who had the true Title. And by this process the landlord, through the suit of his tenant, B, against C, for inter ference with B’s possession, in effect avoided the necessity of instituting a Real Action. 9 (II) Where the Requisite Conditions to Support Trespass Quare Ejectione Firmae were Fictitious, but Grounded on True Facts, — It was soon discovered that the same re sult could be achieved by resort to a ficti tious proceeding which, however, in the be ginning, was based on a true state of facts, The scheme devised worked substantially as follows. The Landlord, 4 desiring to try Title to land not previously under lease, re cruited two friends or collabora tors, .4 and B, who then made an actual Entry upon the land, subsequently to be spoken of as the En try, Such Entry was required in order to avoid being charged with the common - law crime known as maintenance,’ 0 or promoting ~ 4 Minor, Institutes of Common and Statute Law, Division 111, 390 (Richmond 1591 — 1895). L See Keigwln, Cases In Common Law Pleading, e. II, The Common Law Actions, § 52, The Action 0 f Ejeetment, note 6 (2d ed,, Rochester 1934). 19. “It Is a general rule, that no right of entry, or re - entry, can be reserved, or given to any other per son, than the feeffer, donor or lessor, Ac, and their heirs; and suck rJght of entry cannot be assigned lawsuits, as every lease of real estate by an owner not in possession was bound to result in some f orm of action. 4 A and B, now be ing on the land in question, L, the real dis seisor, then handed an actual lease of the premises to A, hereinafter to be known as the Lessee, and then instructed B, hereinaft er to be known as the Casual Ejector, to eject A , the lessee, which he proceeded to do, all of which activity was unknown to the Actual Tenant of the premises, Z. Thereaft er, A, the tenant selected by L, the landlord, instituted a suit against B, his disseisor, un der the scheme. Thus, the official lin e - up became A, ex dem.

As B put up no Defense, Judgment was entered for A, a Writ of Execution issued against Z, the actual tenant, and A was placed in posses sion, after which he surrendered his lea se to the landlord. The student should observe at this point that so far there has been no feigning of the facts. The plaintiff made a bona tide Entry into the land under dispute, thereafter on the land he executed an actual Lease to a real lessee, who imm ediately took possession, after which he was actually eject ed, Thus, every element of the case was of actual occurrence. And! thus, by this process, the landowner was able to try Title to the land in question, without violating the theory that the Action of Trespass for Ejectment was available only to the owner of a non - freehold estate, as A, the fictitious lessee, and the nominal plain tiff (the landlord was the real plaintiff, al - . fact; and third, where the the fiction were assumed to three situations will now be facts supporting be true. 8 These discussed: or tra:nsferred to another ~Litt. f, 341].

Sec. 106 ACTION OF EJECTMENT 229 though not a party to the action) was, so far as the Record went, the holder of a non - free hold or leasehold estate. It is not su rprising, therefore, to find that both Court and Counsel eagerly availed themselves of the loophole thus discovered by means of which questions concerning Ti tles to land which ordinarily could be raised only in some one of the numerous and tech nical Real Actions, might now be brought and determined in a purely Personal Action, with the same results of a Real Action achieved in a simple Action of Trespass, at least so far as possession was involved. 1 ’ In referring to this very point, Sedgwick and Wait aptl y declared: “The history of proce dure nowhere presents a more curious fact than that the owners of the soil [freehold ers] should have suddenly relinquished a system of remedies [the Ancient Real Ac tions]; which had been matured by the ex perience of cen turies, and have consented to try Titles to the freehold in a Personal Ac tion, originally devised to protect the precar ious estates of the inferior tenantry.” 12 This rapid change in procedure, which be gan in the reign of Henry VIII (1509 — 1547) ultimately resulted in the obsolescence of the Real Actions, once it was realized that Eject ment was an efficient instrument for trying the right of possession, and that, in the final analysis, no title could be tried without also trying possession. There was also the addi tional advantage that Ejectment being a Per sonal Action, might be instituted in either King’s Bench or Exchequer, whereas the old Real Actions for trying Title could only be brought in the Court of Common Pleas. And, as in Assumpsit and Trover, now also just coming into vogue, the pleading in Eject ment was genera], with the result that there was small risk of a disastrous variance. 11. Sedgwick and Wait, Principles and Practices Gov erning the Trial of Title to Lana, C. 1, 7, p. 5 (New York 1882). (III) Where the Requisite Conditions to Support Trespass Quare Ejectione Fh’mae were all Assumed to be True, but were aU Fictitious: (A) In GeneraL — After it was discovered that the New Action could be utilized by the freeholders through the us e of the Entry, Lease and Ouster, along about the year 1640, or shortly after the close of Queen Elizabeth’s Reign (1558 — 1603), it finally be came clear that it was a useless formality to make an actual Entry, Lease and Ouster, so the practice grew up that these steps might be eliminated by merely alleging a Fictitious Entry, Lease, and Ouster by the Casual Ejec tor, This procedure was made workable by the fact that the Courts, eager to escape from the old Real Actions, overlooked the false hood involved. As previously observed, the Casual Ejector did not defend, so that Judg ment was given in favor of the Fictitious Lessee and plaintiff, who promptly sued out a Writ of Execution, under which the lessee was placed in possession, the actual te nant, Z, being dispossessed by the Sheriff. (B) The Common Consent Rula — It is not difficult to imagine what Z, the Actual Tenant, who up to now had heard nothing of this suit, said when thus confronted with the Execution. And what he and other Z’s in a si milar position said was expressed in such loud, raucous and determined tones that the Courts decided to do something about it What they did was to make a Rule of Court that no Execution should issue where the Ejector was a stranger, or not the Actual Tenan t, until the adverse actual occupant — the Actual Tenant, Z — was notified of the pendency of the action, and offered an op portunity, if he so desired, to appear and defend the action in place of the Casual Ejec tor. This end was accomplished through the dev ice of a note or letter from the Casual Ejector to the Actual Tenant, notifying him that he had been sued, and that if he desired to defend, he should appear and ask to be 12.

Now, the lineup of the parties reads as follows: A ex dem. (lessee) of L v. Z, the Actual Tenant.

Thus, a glance at the Chart will reveal that after the Fiction in Ejectment had been invoked, the lineup of the parties stood as follows: A, cx dent. L V. Z. Obviously, under this setup, the lessor of the nominal plaintiff, A, is L, the landlord, who, in reality, is the true plaintiff. In the third place, from the Chart the stu dent may understand the basis of the Com mon Law rule that a Judgment in one Action of Ejectment was never a Bar to recovery in another Action. In the case of Caperton v. Schmidt,” the rule has been explained by Sawyer, 3., who decl ared: “But we have seen, that the nile in all cases requires that"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Page 247 of 735 the matter tried must be directly, and not merely collaterally in issue, in order that the judgment shal l be a Bar. And in an Action of Ejeetment at Common Law the title is not directly in issue; hence the Judgment under the rule was not a bar, nor could the determination of the title be used as a mat ter of estoppel.” The Classification of Ejectment THE Action of Ejectment has been vari ously classified. While it was developed as and became a substitute for the Ancient Real Actions, it has never assumed the character of a Real Action. It has sometimes been classified as a Mixed Action, but it does not possess the characteristics of the Common - Law Mixed Action, except the single circum stance that it made it possible for the plain tiff to regain possession of his land. This characteristic, as Professor Keigwin aptly observes was “an adventitious and al most accidental incident of the action, tacked on long after the invention of Ejectment and re sulting from extrinsic causes and an orig inally unforeseen development.” 14 It is no 13. 26 Calif. 479, 499 — 501 (1864). ~ Keigwin, Cases In Common Law Pleadin g, Bk.

It is the name now applied to the action by which the plaintiff asserts his right to possessio n of land, resulting either from absolute owner ship or some lesser proprietary right, where by he is entitled to enter into immediate pos session of some interest in land. The action is, therefore, limited by definition to the re covery of corporeal real property; 16 but not things which are not tangible real proper ty.’ 1 Ejectment may be brought to recover lands or things attached to the land so as to partake of the nature of realty, such as tim ber, growing crops and the like. Personal property and in ge neral incorporeal heredit aments may not be recovered, as the action is limited to property the possession of which may be delivered by the sheriff. 18 For What Property Will Ejectment Lie to Recover? IN consequence, Ejectment will only lie for the recovery of possession of real proper ty, as for lands, or buildings annexed to land, 15. Ibid. is.

The plaintiff need not, however, prove a Perfect Title in himself; he need only show a Title which, as against the defendant, is a better Title. When, therefore, it is possi ble for the plaintiff to show that he was in possession and that the de fendant ejected him by a mere trespass, the prior possession of the plaintiff is superior to that of the de fendant; and upon a showing to that effect, he may recover upon his better but Imper fect Title. 28 As Ejeetment was strictly a legal action, at Comm on Law, it required a Legal Title to maintain or to defeat it. The plaintiff must, therefore, have a legal right to possession. The Legal Title, so far as it relates to the right of possession, must prevail in Eject ment. Hence, one who has such a Title wi ll win as against one who has a mere beneficial or equitable interest, enforceable in the Courts of Equity.

Sec. 106 ACTION OF EJECTMENT 236 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 10 If there has been no Ouster, or the defendant is not th us in possession when the action commenced, the action must fail. Trespass, not Ejectment, would be the proper remedy in such case. EJECTMENT. — . - DISTINGUJSIIED FROM AND CONCURRENT WITH OTHER ACTIONS 107. Strictly speaking, Ejectment is to be distinguished from the Writs of Right to Try Title among the old Real Actions, and from Trespass to Try Title; and it was concurrent with trespass in its early stages of develop ment and with the Writ of Entry. THE Action of EjeCtment, in theory, was desi gned to try the right of possession, and is to be distinguished from the Writs of Right, which, in legal theory, were designed to try Property Rights or Title. These An cient Real Actions, however, were finally abolished, and Ejectrnent was substituted in lieu thereof, as it was found as a practicable matter that you could not Try Title without trying the Right to Possession. The Action is also to be distinguished from Trespass to Try Title, which prevailed in a few Southern States, and which, in those stat es, was a sub stitute for Ejectment, but, unlike Ejectment, could be maintained on an Equitable Title. Ejectment was, of course, concurrent with Trespass, in its early stages of development, as it grew out of Trespass. And, in the sense that it lay whereve r the plaintiff had a Right of Entry, it was also concurrent with the Writ of Entry. FORMS OP DECLARATION AND COMMON CONSENT RULE 105.

To day, the suit is usually brought by the real plaintiff against a defendant who is the Actual Occupant. All Declarations in Ejectment must describe the premises demanded with certainty and precision. THE fictions by which the Action of Eject ment was extended from a remedy for a les see to all claimants, involved alleging in the declaration: (1) A Lease from the real plaintiff to the nominal plaintiff, John Doe; (2) The Entry by the nominal plaintiff wi der the Lease; and (3) The Ouster of the nominal plaintiff by t he nominal defendant (the Casual Ejector, Richard Roe) during the term of the lease. This childish mum mery is now generally discarded. Description of Premises AS the recovery of a specific tract or tracts of land is the main object of this ac tion, the Declaration must describe the prem ises demanded with certainty and precision, so as to clearly identify them, not only in order that it may be seen that the property demanded is the same as that with reference to which evidence is introduced, bu t also in order that possession may be delivered to the plaintiff or demandant if he succeeds in es tablishing his right. 35 35.

The Declaration in Ejectment must de scribe the premises in question, and state the Title. It should also allege a Right of Entry in the plaintiff at the time the action is brought. The Plaintiff’s Right AS we have shown above, the plaintiff, to maintain Ejectment, must have a Legal Right to possession at the time the action is commenced, though prior peaceable posses sion, without further Title, ma y be sufficient as against a mere intruder or trespasser, The Declaration must, of course, show such a Title and Right, or it will fail to state a good cause of action. It is sufficient under some statutory forms to allege that plaintiff was owner and poss essed of the premises sued for, describing them as in a deed of con veyance. 36 DECLARATION IN EJECTMENT — ESSEN TIAL ALLEGATIONS: (3) THE WRONG - Flit OUSTER OR DISPOSSESSION 111.

As we have also seen, the Ouster need not be by an actual turning out of the plaintiff. It may be, for instance, merely a holding over by a tenant after the expiration of his term. It is also generally essential that the defendant shall be in ac tual possession when suit is brought, and that such possession shall be adverse. These requirements may not exist in all the states, for the scope of this action has been enlarged in some of them by statute, The Declara tion must, in all cases, show su ch an Ouster or Dispossession, and such adverse posses sion or claim, as is necessary in the particu lar jurisdiction to a maintenance of the ac tion. 37 DECLARATION IN EJECTMENT — ESSEN TIAL ALLEGATIONS: (4) THE DAMAGES 112. The Declaration should also sta te the Damages caused by the dispossession of the plaintiff, though their recovery is not the main object of the Action. They are usually, at Common Law, Nominal only. If the Action, as in some states, includes the recovery of Mesne Profits, the Damages mu st also include such profits, and should be laid high enough to cover both the Full Amount of Such Profits and the Damages for the injury - WHILE at Common Law the Damages re coverable hi this action were, and in some states still are, only those caused by the dis possession or ouster, and the amount would, therefore, be generally only a nominal sum, in most the plaintiff is also allowed to recov er the Mesne Profits, or those which the de fendant has received during his adverse pos session; 38 and in such case the Damages al 37.

At Common Law a Judgment in an Ac tion of Ejectment was never a Bar to another action, as the real plaintiff, the Landlord, a! though mentioned in the title of the action, was not, in reality, a party to the action, and hence was not bound thereby. With the abohi lion of the Fiction in Ejectment, the action is now directed against the Actual Occupant, as opposed to the Fictitious Lessee, hence a Judg ment is now binding and may be pleaded under the doctrine of res judicata. AS explained earlier, because the landlord, who was mention ed in the Title of a case in Ejeetment, was not in reality a party to the action, the Judgment in Ejectment at Com mon Law was not conclusive, and hence could not be invoked under the doctrine of res judi cata. The judgment, for the same reason, was not ev en conclusive as between the same parties or as to the same land, as the defeated landlord, not being a party to the action, was free to seek two new collaborators, and thus start litigation all over again. This situation created so much dissatisfaction th at in the early part of the Eighteenth Century, after the plaintiff had been defeated in several 50 So. 870 (1909); Mississippi Garner v.

This same early practice was some times the cause of what was known as Equi table Bi lls of Peace. 4 ’ Under modem stat utes abolishing the Fiction in Ejeetment, the action is now directed in the names of the actual parties, hence the Judgment carries the same conclusiveness and finality as any other Judgment and, of course, may be plead ed under the doctrine of rca judicata. 42 DECLARATION IN TRESPASS FOR MESNE PROFITS — ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (1) IN GENERAL 114. In the Declaration in Trespass for Mesne Profits, the Essential Allegations are: (I) The Tithe of the Plaintiff (II) The Ouster or Ejectment (III) The Damages EVERY wrongful Ejectment includes a Trespass, as Ejectment was created by ex tending the Action of Trespass to protect the interests of the non - freeholders or tenants. It follows, therefore, that one who recovers land from which he has been ousted is not only entitled to recover Damages for the original act of dispossession, but he is also entitled to recover Damages for the time the disseisor continued in occupation of the premises and for the wrongful withholding thereof. This act of withholding was, how ever, not a Trespass, though tortious. As Saimond remarks: “To remain wrongfully in possession of land is not, as we have seen, a trespass, although the act of first enter ing upon the land was a trespass.” ‘~ In conse quence, the profits realized from the land by the wrongdoer during the period of wrongful retention of the property, were not recover - 41.

In order to place himself in a legal position to recover the profits acquired by the wrongdoer, the plaintiff was required to regain possession by a lawful Re - Entry, or by a Judgment in the Action of Ejectment. Havi ng recovered possession, the owner was, by a Legal Fic tion, presumed” to have been in possession throughout the intervening period. Upon this presumed possession, the plaintiff may then bring an Action f or Mesne Profits against the person who was the def endant in the Action of Ejectment. In this action, the wrongful occupation may be alleged as a continuing Trespass which entitles the own er, now restored to possession, to all the prof its made during the period of his ouster. These profits included crops , rents, or other assets taken from the land during the period of disseisin, as well as other Damages due for injury to the property.~ DECLARATION IN TRESPASS FOR MESNE"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Page 257 of 735 PROFITS — ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (2) THE PLAINTIFFS RIGHT, TITLE, INTEREST OR POSSESSION 115. The Declaration in Trespass for Mesne Profits must describe the premises from which the profits arose, and the title of the plaintiff thereto, as well as the value of the profits them selves, and their receipt by the defendant. IT is obvious from the nature of this aE - ’ tion that the plaintiff must expressly state and describe the different parcels of land 44. 3 Blgckstone, Commentaries on the Law of Eng land, c. 12 Of Trespass Wrongs, 210 (1st Ain.ed.

As it is a separate action from the pri or Action of Ejectment, the plaintiff’s title to the premises should also appear, a s ‘cvell as the value of the Mesne Profits accrued, and their receipt by the defendant during the period of the Ejectment. All these facts are stated in a general and summary manner, as in other Forms of Trespass, save that the description of the premises must be such as to identify them, and the value of the Mesne Profits which the defendant is alleged to have received must be correctly alleged. 4 ’ The pleader will here avoid confusion by not ing that while this action may be between those only who were par ties to the prior Ac tion of Ejectn’.ent, and while in such cases the Judgment in that Action will be Conclu sive Proof of the plaintiff’s Possessory Title, and of the Entry and Possession of the de fendant,~ the suit may also be for the re covery of Mesne Profits for an occupancy antecedent to the time for which the plain tiff’s Title has been actually established, or the Action may be brought against a prece dent occupier, in which cases the Record would not be admissible, and the plaintiff would be compelled to prove his Title as in any action. 49 The action, therefore, so far as the pleadings are concerned, must be sepa rate and independent, as if no prior adjudi cation had been made. 46.

STATUS OF EJECTMENT AND TRESPASS FOR MESNE PROFITS UNDER MOD ERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES OF COURT 118. Under certain Modem Codes and Prac tice Acts the Plaintiff may recover mesne profits in his action t o recover possession of real property, thereby in effect permitting a combination of what at the Common Law were the separate actions of Ejectment and Trespass for mesne profits. Ejeetment (I) In England. — In the form and scope, as outlined above, the Action of Ejectment continued down to modern times, supersed ing practically all the Ancient Real Actions known to the Common Law. By the Statute of 3 & 4 Wm. IV, c. 27, § 36 (1833), the Real Actions were abolished, Ejectm ent, under Section 36 being one of Four Actions except ed. The Statute provided that no descent cast, discontinuance, or warranty shall here after defeat any Right of Entry or Action for the recovery of any lands, and this enact ment, in effect, converted all Titles into Pos sessory Titles, and thus made the remedy by Ejectment of universal application, and, in this Form, it remained unchanged until 1852.

IV, c 27 (1833), underwent material change, which had the effect of abolishing the fictitious proceeding in Ejectment and of reforming and sim plify ing its procedure. Pleadings of all kinds were abolished and thereafter the action was commenced by a Judicial Writ directed to the person in possession and to all persons enti tled to defend the possession of the property claimed and described in th e Writ, command ing them to appear and defend the possession of the property sued for, or such part there of as they may deem fit, and notifying them that in default of appearance they would be turned out of possession. If the defendants failed to appear, or appeared for the purpose of defending only a part of the property, the plaintiff was entitled to a Judgment of Re covery of all or part of the land sued for, as the case might be. As appearance itself con stituted a Defense to the Writ, the Court then m ade up an issue between the one who claimed possession in the Writ and the par ties appearing to defend their possession. Such issue, thus formulated, was then fried according to the general principles which the Common Law had developed for the govern ing of the former Action of Ejectrnent. It was assumed that these three Reforming Acts authorized the use of Equitable Defens es, but the Courts in construing them held that such Defenses were not available, as the Pleadings had been abolished. (B) The Su preme Court of Judicature Act of 1873,~° — In this Form the Action contin ued down to the Supreme Court of Judica ture Act of 1873. Under this Act the Supe rior Courts of Law and the Courts of Chan cery were consolidated into the High Court of Justice, with five divisions, and thereafter the Action of Ejectnient, and all other ac tions, were commenced by a Judicial Writ of Summons, upon which the plaintiff endorsed a Statement of his Calm, together with the relief asked for, to which the defendant made a Stat ement of his Defense. The pleadings were governed by Rules of Court under Gen eral Orders issued in 1833. By Rule 21 un - der Order XXI, a defendant in possession was excused from pleading his Title unless his Defense depended upon a.n equitable estate or ri ght, or unless he asked for relief on eq uitable grounds. Under the influence and effect of the foregoing statutory changes, extending from 1833 until now, in England, Ejectment has lost its name and many of its distinctive features, but even today, the pr in ciples underlying the Action of Ejectment still govern where an Action is brought for the recovery of land. (II) In the United States. — The Action of Ejectment, as developed at Common Law, and prior to the modem statutory changes in England, was general ly adopted in the Sev eral States of the United States. Some idea as to the extent of its acceptance can be seen in Tyler’s excellent work on Ejectment, 57 the particulars of which cannot be included here, In most states the Fictitious Proceeding in Ejectm ent has been wholly abolished, and such statutes usually provide that the action shall be brought in the name of the Real Claimant out of possession against the Ac - thai Tenant or occupant of the land. With the old Fictitious Allegations swept away, the Act ion has been converted into a simple and direct remedy for the assertion of Title to real property held adversely, and for the recovery of its possession. Thus, for exam ple, in the State of Illinois, the Action of Ejectment was expressly retained by the S tatute,M but Section 8 of the same statute provided that “The use of fictitious names of 57.

The situation was mod ified in most of the Code States, in most of which it was provid ed that a defendant might Plead as many Several Defenses as he had, whether Con sistent or Inconsistent, or whether denom inated Legal or Equitable. In such states a defendant may offer Proof of an Equitable Title against a Legal Title shown by a plain tiff in an Action of Ejectment. And the same provision also prevails even in some states which failed to adopt the Code Form of Pro cedure. ~ 3 Oomp.Laws Mich.1915, ~ 13168, 13169. fluE see Doe ex dem, Alabama State Land Co. v McCullough, 155 Ala. 240, 46 South 472 (1910); Doe ox dem.

Trespass for Mesne Profits ORIGINALLY, the Action of Ejectment was an action for the recovery of Damages, not for recovery of the premises, and at that time the Mesne Profits were the measure of the Damages. But when it became estab lished that the premises was recovered in an Action of Ejectment, the Damages in the action were limited to Nominal Damages. And this was the development which created the necessity of what came to be known as the Action of Trespass for Mesne Profits. 61 In some states this Form of Action is still the proper remedy. In certain states, however, by statute, the plaintiff was required to re cover for Mesne Profits in the original action to recover the premises, 62 whereas, in others, the provision was not mandatory.° 3 An ex ample of this type of statute, changing the Common Law Rule, may be found in Section 601 of the New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, 1968, which contains the following provisions: “In an action to recover the possession of real prope rty, the plaintiff may recover damages for withhold ing the property, including the rents and prof its or the value of the use and occupation of the property for a term not exceeding six years; but the damages shall not include the value of the use of any improvements made by the defendant or those under whom he claims.” 61. 000dtitle v.

The Action of Detinue lies where It is sought to recover, not Damages for the taking or detention of a personal chattel, but the chat tel itself, with Damages for its detention. The Judgment awards either recovery of the chat tel itself, or its value, with Damages for its detention. To maintain the action — (I) The chattel must be specific and capable of identification; (II) The plaintiff must have either a Gen eral or Special Property hi the chat tel, or the Right to Immediate Pos session; (III) The defendant must be in the Actual Possession of the chattel at the time of Commencing Suit THE action of Detinue is the only remedy by suit at common law for the recovery of I.

It seems that the action was originally deem ed an action cx con tractu, but now the wrongful detention of the goods is consid ered the Gist of the Action. The action lies without regard to any bailment or contract, and even though the defendant may have wrongfully obtained possession in the first instance; and it is therefore more properly classed with Actions cx delicto, or with Pro prietary Actions. 3 West virginia: Young v.

McKelvry, in his short work on Principles of Com mon - Law Pleading, e. II, § 18, 11 (New York 1804). in discussing the problem of the proper classifica tion of dctinue, declares: “In detinue this feature is not quite so appare nt; in fact, the tendency has been to class the action with that of Trover. and to treat the detaining in the former action as a tor tious act similar to the converting In the latter. The Action of Detinue was for a long pe riod the proper remedy of the ba ilor and special or acquired right. For, while it is true that one person has the natural right not to have his property interfered with by another, and that wrongful detention is an Interference which would be a violation of this right, yet, viewed in th is light, the wrongful act furnishes ground for an action of Trover, and not Detinuc. [Kettle v. Bromsall, Willes 120, 125 Eng.Rep. 1087 (1738), where the dis tinction is noticed, and it is held that Trover and Detinue cannot be joined.] “ The same act may furnish grounds for an action of Detinue, but not unless it is viewed in another light, namely, as a detention of property which the defendant is under an obligation to deliver to the plaintiff, or in other words, a failure to perform a sp ecial obligation, a violation of a special right, which the plaintiff has acquired not by reason of his simple ownership of the property, hut by reason of the fact that there is a special relation between himself and the defendant, such as a bailment, and that owning or having the general right to the property which is lawfully in defendants posses sion, he has asserted that right in such a wa3 - — a g., by demand — as to acquire a special right to the im mediate possession of the property, and to put up on the defendant a special obligation to deliver it to him. It has already been seen that the judg ment in the action of Detinue is for the recovery of the property or its value in the alternative. The special obligation to deliver the property, similar to an obl igation based on a promise and arising be cause of the special relation of the parties, is thus recognized and enforced. In fact, the action of Detinue has been brought upon a contract to deliv er a specific chattel. [Fitaherbert, Natura Breviuni, p. 138]. It seems clear, therefore, tbat Detinue is properly classed with the actions of Debt, Covenant, and Assumpsit. [These forms of action are gener ally distinguished by the term actions Cr oontroctr’, as distinguished from the actions known as Ca delictu, on the theory that the former are brought upon contract and the latter for a tort or wrong. The terms, however, are not strictly applicable, as the idea of contract in its usually understood sense does not necessarily enter into the action of Debt or that of Detinue, both of said actions many times being founded upon obligations arising from special relations between the parties other than contractual. Further, to say tbat an action is for a wrong, does not distinguish it, as every action is for a wrong. The writer submits that the true ba sis of the distinction which undoubtedly does exist, is that the one class of actions is for wrongs which are violations of original or natural rights, — rights which belong to one person as ggainst all others; while the other class Is for wrongs which are yb - “It is conceived that the true theory of the action of detinue is that the detention is the violation of a 246 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 11 was chiefly used in the field of bailment. When an owner bails or delivers a thing to another for any purpose, he has an action against the baflee for the return of the goods; but whether the action was based up on ownership or upon contract was a distinc — tion not clearly drawn or perceived. Grad ually the claim for a Specific Chattel was dis tinguished from a Debt or Claim for a Cer tain Quantity of Money, or of Corn or the Like. Roughly, this distinction may seem to correspond with that between contractual and proprietary rights. Detinue in its modern form (theory) has come to be wha t we may term a Proprietary Action, a remedy to enforce a right of prop — erty. It carries into effect the right to the immediate possession of a particular thing. The restitution of the goods themselves wrongfully withheld makes it necessary, in this actio n of Detinue, to ascertain the thing detained, in such manner that it may be spe cifically known and recovered. Therefore it cannot be brought for money, corn, or the like; for that cannot be known from other money or corn, unless it be in a bag or sack, f or then it may be distinguishably marked, and unless the property is specified the duty enforced would be a mere debt or obligation. latloas of special or acquired rights, — riglits which one person has against some other particular per son or persons who h ave come into some special re lation with him.)”"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Page 263 of 735 It was formerly urged by such a distinguished scholar as Dean Ames, that detinue originated out of the contract of bailment under which the defendant bailee was forced to deliver up specific chattels. There after, the scope of the action was extended, so that it ceased to be based on a personal obligu tboa and became based on a property right and wrongful detention. The view of Dean Ames has been brought In serious question by Professor Fi’ foot, In his excel lent recent work on The History and sources of the Common Law, c. 2, Detinue, 24 - ’ 43 (London 1949). See, also, on this problem, Whiteliead v. Harrison, 6 Q.E. (N.S.) 422, 115 Eng.Eep. 162 (1844); Wlard v. Semken, 2 App.D.O. 424 (1893), There was a most serious imperfection in the remedy of Detinue, even where it exist ed. Its Judgment was Conditional — that the plaintiff should recover from the defendant the said goods, or (if they cannot be had) their Value and the Damages for detaining t hem. This left to the defendant the choice between delivering up the thing and paying a sum of money, and if he would do neither the one nor the other, then goods of his were seized and sold, and the plaintiff in the end had to take money instead of the th ing that he demanded. 4 In modern times this defect has been cured, so that a plaintiff who recovers in Detinue gets a Judgment for the specific de livery of the chattel detained. The action may now be used concurrently with Replev in, Trover, and Trespass de bonis aspo?’tatis, in all cases of the wrongful detention of chat tels, regardless of whether the defendant originally acquired possession lawfully by bailment or by theft. For What Property DETINUE lies for the recovery of a Spe cific Chattel only, a nd not for the recovery of fixtures, or other real property.° The goods for which it is brought must be dis tinguishable from other property, and their identity ascertainable by some certain means.° It lies to recover any chattel that is 4.

But where property which was attached to the realty so as to become a part of it, has been removed, and where timber, crops or minerals have been severed, thus acqairing the character of perso nal property, detinue will lie.

Once Detinue was differentiated from Debt, it was distinguishable from that action as being for the recovery of specific chattels as contrasted to money; it was distinguished from Replevin originally as being available only where the defendant acquired possession lawfully, whereas in Replevin the defendant ob tained possession wrongfully; it differed also in respect to the time when possession or its equivalent was to be restored to the plaintiff.

The two actions were and are still distinguish able in that in Replevin the plaint iff is re stored to the possession prior to the deter mination of the matter of right between the parties, whereas in Detinue the plaintiff does not recover his property until the matter of right between the parties has been deter mined by a Final Judgment in the Action, and not even then if the defendant prefers to keep the chattel and pay its assessed value.’ 2 In Trover, as contrasted with Det inue, the Judgment was for the recovery of Money Damages for the wrongful act of con version, whereas, in Detinue , the Primary Object of the Action was to recover Specific 10’ See, 3 Reoves, History of English Law, c.

Detinue had be come, in its final stage of development, to a considerable extent a concurrent remedy with the actions of Trespass do bonis asportatis and Trover. FORMS OF DECLARATION AND JUDG MENT IN IJETINUE 121. The Forms under the Action of Detinue include not only the Declaration, but also a Form of a Judgment. The latter is included in order to show that the Judgment in Detinue, contrary to Judgments in the other Actions, was Conditional or in the Alternative, that is, for the Specific Chattels sued for, or if they were not available, their Value plus Damages for the wrongful detention.

One of the major defects in the Action of Detinue consisted of the fact that its judgment was condi tIonal or in the alternative. Thus, it provided that the plaintiff should recover of the defenda nt the specific chattels sued for, or if they were not avail able, their value plus damages for the wrongful de tention, See Kirkland v. FIlcher, 174 Ala. 170, 57 So, 48 (1911). This defect was remedied by Section 78 of the Common Law Procedure Act of 1854 , which empowered a court or judge, upon applica attorney, complains of Augustus White (the defendant in this suit), who has been sum moned to answer the said plaintiff in an ac tion of Detinue. For that whereas the said plaintiff heretofore and before th e com mencement of this suit, to wit, on the 12th day of February, in the year of our Lord 1845, had delivered to the said defendant cer tain goods and chattels, to wit, twenty pipes of wine of the said plaintiff, of great value, to wit of the value of £2, 000, to be redelivered by the said defendant to the said plaintiff when the said defendant should be thereunto afterwards requested: yet the said defend ant, although he was afterwards, to wit, on the first day of March, in the year aforesaid, requested by the said plaintiff so to do, hath not as yet delivered the said goods and chat tels, or any of them, or any part thereof, to the said plaintiff, but so to do hath hitherto wholly refused, and still refuses, and still unjustly detains the same from the sai d plaintiff, to the damage of the said plaintiff of £800, and thereupon he brings his suit,~ MARTIN, Civil Procedure at Law, 371 (St. Paul, 1905). JUDGMENT IN DETINUE’ 5 Common THEREFORE it is considered that the plaintiff do recover against the defendant the said goods and chattels (or “deeds and pa per” etc. or enumerating them, if enumerat ed in the postea,) or the said sum of tion of the plaintiff, to order the return of the spe cific chattel in question, thus depriving the defend’ ant of his option of retaining the chattel upon pay ment of the value assessed, Cf.

The plaintiff must say either, “I bailed th e chattel to you,” or “I lost the goods and you found them” (detinue stir tro - ver). Only in times much later did the lawyers say that these phrases about finding (Trover) and bailment, though one of them must be used, are not “Traversable,” and that defend ant must not deny them, but must deny the wrongful detention.’ 8 The Plaintiff’s Right The plaintiff must have either a General or Special Property in the chattels, or he must have a Right to the immediate Pos session of them.’° That he has this right 16.

An action to recover possession of a chattel, or its value in case delivery cannot be had, may be maintained under many Modem Codes and Practice Acts under the sam e cir cumstances as an Action of Detinue would be maintainable at Common Law. IN the California case of Faulkner v. First National Bank of Santa Barbara, 3 ° decided in the year 1900, under the statutory provi sions concerning the Claim and Delivery of Personal Property, the plaintiff averred that she had deposited certain promissory notes as collateral security for a promissory note made to plaintiff by another; that she de manded that defendant deliver the notes to her; and that such demand was refused, and that the defendant still unlawfully withholds and detains the same, to the damage of the plaintiff in a certain sum. The prayer was for the recovery of the notes, or for the sum of forty - six hundred dollars, the value there of . After a Verdict and Judgment for the plaintiff, the defendant Appealed, bringing up the Judgment Roll, which included a Bill of Exceptions. In affirming the Judgment, McFarland, J., declared: “The Cause of Ac tion in the Case at Bar is based on a contrac t of bailment. The original taking was not unlawful, but the detention was.

The Action of Replevin lies, where Specif ic Personal Property has been wrong fully taken and is wrongfully detained, to re cover Possession of the Property, together with Damages for its detention. To support the Ac tion, it is necessary: That the Property shall be Personal; That the plaintiff, at the time of the Suit, shall be entitled to the Im mediate Possession; (III) That (at Common Law) the def end - ant shall have wrongfully taken the property (Replevin in the Cepit). But, by Statute, in most States, the Action will also Lie where the property is wrongfully detained, though it was lawfully obtained, the first instance (Re - plevin in the Detinet); (W) That the property shall be wrongful ly detained by the defendant at the time of the Suit. The Primary and Secondary Object ives of .Replevin THE Primary object of Replevin is to en able the plaintiff to obtain possession of the 1.

The Action has to a large extent, as we shall see, displaced Detinue, and is now the common remedy to recover possession of a chattel and Damages for its wrongful de tention, or, in case the thing itself cannot be recovered, Damages for its value as well as for its de tention. The Action, therefore, is not founded merely upon the right to obtain redress for a tort; in Replevin and"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Page 270 of 735 Detinue, recovery of specific propert y is the end and aim of the Action. In present - day Law, the Action ef Replevin differs from Detinue chiefly by the circumstance that the plaintiff at once se cures possession of the chattels in dispute. This immediate relief is in the nature of a provision al remedy, granting the plaintiff a recovery of the chattels pending the outcome of the action. By this provisional relief the plaintiff really accomplishes his object to get possession of his goods; to retain possession, however, he must prosecute his act ion and establish his right. Hence, as a condition of securing this relief in advance and having the Sheriff deliver the property — the horse and plough — over to him, he was and is re quired to give security in the form of a bond or undertaking, with sureties , to make out the justice of the claim or return the prop erty to the defendant. Does Replevin Lie for AU Unlawfv1 Takings? AT Common Law Replevin lay only for an unlawful taking of goods. But for several hundred years it was employed chiefly for only one sort of unlawful taking, that of a wrongful distress. 3 The Writ of Replevin, as shown by the Form in the Register, mere - 3 - “A distress is the taking of a personal chattel without legal process from the possession of a wrongdoer into the hands of the party aggrieved. as a pledge for the redress of an injury, the per formance of a duty, or the satisfaction of a dc mand.” Bradby, on Distress, c. VIII, Of a Distress ly alleged an unlawful taking and withhold ing by the defe ndant — cepit et injuste deti net, or taken and unjustly detained — and there is no suggestion in the early Law which in theory limits Replevin to the field of dis tress, and this view is supported by the fact that the Writ and Pleadings, which is always good evidence of the Law, contains no lan guage restricting the action to a wrongful dis tress. 4 As thus developed, an Action of Replevin was the regular way for the plaintiff - tenant to contest the validity, of the extra - judicial seizure by which his lanälord had taken his goods upon a distress for rent. It consisted in a redelivery of the pledge, or thing taken in distress — the horse and plough, — to the owner, upon his giving security or bond to try the right of distress and to restore it if the right should be adjudged against him. 6 The theory of the action, as we have ob served, was broad enough to cover any case of wrongful taking, and the statement of Blackstone that it was only available in cases of wrongful distress was soon shown to be incorrect. 6 It is n ow clearly recognized as for Fines and Amercements, (1st Am. ed. New York, 1808). Distress, as here defined, is not to be confused with the remedy of distress as used for the enforcement of Reeognizances or to compel the payment of fines and amercements, whore the right to distrain is derived from the agreement of the parties or from custom. Bradhy, on Distress, e. VIII, Of a Distress for Fines and Amercements, (1st Am. ed. New York, 1808).

This action is usually brought to try the legality of a distress; but it will lie for any unlawful taking of a chattel. Posses sion by the plaintiff, and an actual wrongful taking by the defendant, are the only points requisite to support the action; and none of the cases, defining the nature of the action, confine it specially to the ease of a chattel, taken under pretence of a distress. The old authorities are, that Replevin lies for goods taken t ortiously, or by a trespasser; and that the party injured may have Replevin. or Trespass, at his election. This is so laid down by Gascoigne, J., in 7 Hen. IV, 25b, and by Danhy, 3., in 2 Ed~v. IV, 16, and by Brian, J., in 6 lIen.

The provisions in our statute (11 Sess. e. 5). 12 R.8. 522, et seq.] apply chiefly to cases of illegal distress: but there is nothing which confines the remedy to that particular injury. “If this question he considered upon principle, It Is proper this Action should be maintainable, wherever there is a tortious taking of a chattel out of the possession of another. A great variety of cases might be stated, in which no Damages which a Jury is legally competent to give, can compensate for the loss of a particular chattel.” “The Nonsuit must, therefore, be set aside, and a New Trial granted, with costs to abide the event of the suit.” 7. “The Writ of Replevin, as shown by the Register, merely alleged an unlawful taking and withholding by the defendant.” 3 Street, Foundations of Legal Liability, e. xvi, The Action of Repievin, 215 (Northport, 1900); Mennie v.

Smethurst,° on Detinue factual situations, that is, where the defendant came into possession of the chattel lawfully, and thereafter unlawfully detained it, the plain tiff, in both cases, instead of suing in D et inue, brought Replevin, thus in effect re questing the respective Courts to expand the Scope of Replevin so as to include a mere wrongful detention, and by this process of Judicial Legislation bring about the absorp tion of Detinue by Replevin. This, bo th Courts, English and American, refused to do, Chief Justice Whelpley, in Harwood v. Sme thurst,’° stating in the following striking lan guage: “Although this remedy {Replevin] may be prompt, efficacious, and beneficial, and in many cases the only one giv ing the necessary relief to a party having a right to the possession of chattels, I do not feel at liberty, entertaining, as I do, a clear convic tion that a tortious taking is necessary by the Common Law as the ground of the action, to indulge in judicial legislation for the purpose of enlarging the Scope of the Action.” Thus, the Court refused, by judicial action, to ex tend Replevin to include an unlawful deten tion, and thus bring about a merger of Deti nue in Replevln. But what the Court refused to do by ,Judi cfa~ Legislation in the Mennie and Harwood cases, the Legislature of New Jersey did by express enactment, thus finally extending the sco pe of Replevin to include a lawful taking and an unlawful detention, which the Court sonal property In all eases where there was an un lawful detalner, regardless of the manner of taking, and recovery of the property was had only after Judgment.

The end was achiev ed by a statute which provided “That any un lawful detention of goods and chattels from their lawful owner, or the person entitled by law to the possession of the same, shall be deemed an unlawful taking for the purpose of supporting an Action of Replevin?’” Prior to this development, if B merely de tained goods which he had acquired law fully, A had to proceed in Detinue and could not replevy the goods on the basis of an un lawful detention.

In Form the Action p ro ceeds for Damages, but, if the plaintiff fails, the defendant will be given Judgment for the return of the chattels — the horse and plough. After the provisional remedy of immediate delivery is granted both parties, as we have seen, become actors in the suit; the plaintiff to be vindicated in his possession and to re cover Damages, while the defendant is like a plaintiff asserting his claim to the chattels. The pleading by which the landlord - defend ant prayed for their return was formerly called an Avowry or Cognizance, which was in the nature of a Cross - Declaration.

Replevin and Tres pass were to be distinguished, in the sense that Replevin assumed property in the plaintiff, whereas Trespass assumed property in the tort feasor. Otherwise Replevin became to a con siderable extent a concurrent remedy with Detinue and Trespass; and later with Trover. IT was early settled that Replevin would lie upon any wrongful taking. In conse quence, Gascoigne, C. 3., in a case decided in 1406,18 said that Replevin was concurr ent with Trespass. In theory, therefore, one who was disseised of a chattel might elect to sue in Detinue, Replevin and Trespass. If he sued in Detinue he might recover the chattel, or if it was not available, then he might recover its value, but it remained in the defendant’s hands until the action was completed. If he sued in Replevin, he re acquired the chattel as his own, plus dam ages for the wrongful detention. If he sued in Trespass, he could recover damages for the full value of the chattel, as the action pro ceeded on the theory that the property had vested in the tortfeasor. 1 ° Still later, in more modern times, the Action of Trover al so became available against a trespasser who took and converted chattels to h is own use. But for some reason, not quite clear, Replev in did not become popular as a concurrent remedy with Trespass. Street t ° suggests that the explanation may lie in the circum stance that in Bracton’s day Replevin was subject to Wager of Law, or it m ay have been due to the fact that the defendant - land - 18 - YB. 7 Hen.

Of course, this distinction evaporated under modern statutes merging the two actions. And as we have seen, Replevin was to be d is - tinguished from Trespass, the one being available where the property in the chattel remains in the plaintiff, the other being available where the plaintiff chooses to as sume the property to be in the trespasser. FORMS OF THE ORIGINAL WRIT, PLAINT, DE CLARATION AND BOND IN REPLEVIN 129. This section contains Forms of the Original Writ, Plaint, Declaration and Bond in the Action of Replevin, The Original Writ in Replev4n THE Original Writ in R.eplevin gave the Action a dual character; it furnished an ex peditious method by which the tenant could immediately regain possession of the horse and plough, and it authorized a hearing as an incident thereof to determine the legality of the alleged wrongful taking and detention, and award Damages, and at one stage in the development of the Action this hearing might be held before the Sheriff. Viewed from the standpoint of the first command of the Writ, the Action appears to be a proceed ing to regain possessi on of personal property wrongfully taken and detained, and it has been so viewed by some authors.~’ Viewed from the standpoint of the second command of the Writ, the Action appears to be a Pro ceeding to Recover Damages for the unlaw ful taking and detenti on of personal property, 21. Bouvler, Law Dictionary, Replevin. Sec. 129 ACTION OF REPLEVIN 259 and it has been so defined by Saunders, 22 Stephen 23 and Tidd. 24 Despite statements which have been construed to the contrary, 25 no case of Replevin appears which has not been commenced with a Writ requiring the Sheriff to cause the goods to be replevied, or by Plaint to the Sheriff, followed by a precept to replevy the goods. 26 The two proceedings, in reality, were nev er separate and independent of each other. The recovery of the goods under the first command of the Writ was only provisional, that is, it restored possession of the chattels to the plaintiff, pending proceedings under the second command to do justice; if the plainti ff failed to make out his case, the chat tels of necessity were returned to the def end - ant. The dual character of the Original Writ in fteplevin will appear in the Form of the Original Writ set out below. Distinction Between Hepievin in the Detinuit and Replevin in the Detinet AT Common Law Replevin in the detinet lay for a wrongful detention of goods taken under a lawful distress for rent. 2~ But in practice the action was usually confined to cases of wrongfui distress, such as a wrong ful distress for re nt, damage feasant, sewers’ rates, and the like. 28 22.

Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, c. III, Personal Actions E x Delicto, Art. V. Beplevin, 93, 96 (St. Paul, 1905). The Modem Form of the Action of Replev in is in the detinuit, which is so called be cause, as the word imparts, it is brought when the goods have been delivered by the Sheriff to the plaintiff. 29 Replev in in the detinet lay to recover goods which were still detained, but it has long been obsolete. It follows therefore that when Replevin in the detinet was available, the plaintiff was en titled to recover the value of the goods as well as Damages for thei r taking; 30 whereas in Replevin in the detinuit, the plaintiff was entitled to recover only Damages for the wrongful taking. Wilkinson ~‘ understood that there were two kinds of Replevin — one in the detinuit and the other in the detüwt. But Martin sug gests that this supposition was the direct outgrowth of a reasonable Variation in the Declaration, turning on whether the Sheriff found or failed to find the property. If the property was found and delivered to the plaintiff, the plaintiff then declared in the detinuit, describing the wrong for which he claimed Damages as an accomplished act of the past. 32 In this Form of the Declaration, it was alleged that the goods taken “were de tained until replevied by the Sheriff” a phrase which came to be abbreviate d by al leging that they were “detained until, etc.,” which was called “Declaring in the Deti nuit”” As the Sheriff was usually success ful in delivering the hone and plough, this was the more usual Declaration; it was filed after the result of the Sheriff ’s action was known, and Damages were only for the orig 29. 1 Wins.

In such an instance the plaintiff re covered Damages for the continued detention of the chattels, which was inclusive of the full value of the chattels taken and still de tained, as well as Damages for the wrongful taking? 5 The same Declaration could be a detinuit as to the part returned, and a defl net as to the r esidue not found or returned. 36 Martin suggests that there probably never was a distinct Action of Replevin in the deti net, but that there was also probably never a time when, after issue of the Replevin Writ, the plaintiff could not declare in the detinet if the Sheriff failed to redeliver the goods, as it was quite clear that unless he did so, he could not recover the value of the chattels. 3 ’ In any event it seems evident that the Variation in the Form of Declaration had no effect in changing the action; but went only to the Measure of Damages, and this ceased to be necessary, as under the Declaration in the cietinuit, as finally developed, the Courts permitted the plaintiff to show that the goods were still detained, so as to bring their value int o the assessment, and hence to that end the value was alleged in the Declaration 34.

The Essential Allegations of the Dec laration are: (I) The pl aintiff’s Title to Certain Goods at the Commencement of the Ac tion; (II) The Unlawful Taking and Deten tion; or by Statute in Some States, an Unlawful Detention only; (III) The Demand and refusal in Certain Cases; (W) The Damages The property must be described sufficiently for identification, but the right of the plaintiff may be generally stated. AS has been stated before, the property which is the subject of this action must be personal, and such as is capable of definite descri ption and of delivery; and, in describ ing it in the Declaration, care and accuracy must be used, since the question of identifica tion is an important one. Where the chattels taken and detained are in their nature dis tinguishable from an others of a simi lar kind, less particularity of description is required than when they are not so distinguishable. In the latter case the Declaration must go further, and show what indicia or earmarks are peculiar to them. 4 ’ The plaintiff should Count on the identical chattels replevied, and no more or less, as the defendant might be entitled to a Judgment for the return of a larger or the correct number, though not a number less than actually in question; ~ and the Declarati on should also state their value correctly, though the strictness formerly necessary is not now required. 43 In brief, here, as in all cases where specific property is in question, the statement must be suffi ciently accurate and complete for the Court and Jury to see that the property as to which evidence is offered is the same as that re ferred to in the pleadings. The practice in bringing Actions of Re plevin is now almost universally regulated by statute, and the statutes must therefore be consulted. In some states the Declaration is not used at all, but an Affidavit takes its place. In these cases the Affidavit must comply with the rules above stated, for it must, like a Declaration, show facts consti tuting a cause of action, DECLARATI ON IN REPLEVIN — ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (2) THE PLAINTIFF’S RIGHT, TITLE, INTEREST OR POSSES SION 131. It is sometimes said that the Jieclara tion must allege a General or Special Property Interest in the articles taken and detained, or (by statute) merely detained, and the plaintiff’s 41.

TO support Replevin, the plaintiff must have and must allege such a property in the goods, either General or Special, as en titled him to the immediate possession of them, as against the defendant. It is not sufficient to allege that the plaintiff was “en titled to the possession of the goods”; the Declaration should aver that the articles were the “goods and chattels of the pl aintiff” at the time of the taking. 44 If he cannot show this, the action must fail, without re gard to whether the defendant has any title, or not; for the action must be maintained, if at all, on the strength of the plaintiff’s own title and right. 45 Even though he may 44.

Right of Possession is the ground Of the action, rather than General Ownership. In reason, it would seem to be clear that the right of the plaintiff to possession of the property, as against the defendant, should be the only question to be determined, and that actual title should only be material in so far as it determines this righ t. In some states, however, it is held that mere posses. sion at the time of the unlawful taking of property by one without any authority at ali is not enough to support Replevin, though it might be sufficient to support Trover; that either a General or Sp ecial ownership must be shown, even as against a mere wrongdoer; and that, for instance, one who has the care of goods merely for safe - keep ing, without any interest in them, cannot maintain the action. 49 In some states, on the other hand, no title need be shown, as against Herbert, 61 ill. 126 (1871); Massachusetts: Esso:, s - .

Where goods are taken from a person in peaceable possession, by one who has not title or authority, the mere prior possession will support the action against the latter. 5 ° The mere custody of a servant or agent is an insufficient basis t o enable him to bring Replevin for a wrongful taking, but suit must be brought by the one for whom he holds. 5 ’ The plaintiff must in all cases have the right to possession at the time the action is brought, and not merely at some prior or subsequent time; for “the state of things existing when the suit is commenced will control the determination.” 52 Am.Dec. 695 (1829); Miller v. Adslt, 16 Wend. (N.Y.) 335 (1836). Beplevin is a possessory action, and lies only in favor of one entitled to possession at th e time of its eon, meneement, and the right to possession must be coupled with Ownership, either General or Special.

The Declaration must show such an in terference by the defendant as subjects him to liability in Replevin under the Jaws of the particular state. At Common Law it was nec essary to allege a wrongful taking; but, by statute, in many states an unlawful detention of the chattel at the time of the suit, is suffi cient. And the general rule is that the defend ant must have possession at the time of Com mencing the Suit. In Gencra1 THOUGH, as we have seen, Replevin was originally used in cases in which property had been illegally taken in distress, it is not so limited now, but will lie in any case where the goods have been wrongfully taken and wrongfully detained, provided, of course, the plaintiff is entitled to their possession. 57 An unlawful deteption, without an unlawful tak ing, is not enough. title.

If, however, the Judgment were taken under the Statute along with the Common - Law Judgment for a return, it operated as a stay of the Writ for the Return of the goods.

AS we have previously observed in Mennic"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Page 287 of 735 v. Bialcc ‘~ and Harwood v. Smethtirst, 8 ° the English and American Court refused, by Judicial Legislation, to extend Replevin so as to include a Detinue factual situation. But what the Courts refused to do by Judi cial Legislation was subsequently accom p lished by legislation which, in general, pro vided that for the purpose of supporting an Action of Replevin an unlawful taking was not necessary. As a result of this develop ment, and entirely aside from the Codes, Detinue was in effect abolished and Replevin expanded in scope so as to cover all forms of taking, whether lawful or unlawful. This was the situation when the Codes purported to abolish the Common Law Ac tions, What effect, then, has the Code had upon the Action? The answer to this ques tion may be found in the 1901 New York case of Sinnott v. Felock,”’ in which the plaintiff brought an action to recover certain chattels, which the Court referred to as an Action of Replevin, and in which it was al leged the plaintiff has been induced to sell the chattels to the defendant by fraud on the part of the latter. In his Opening State ment the plaintiff’s counsel conceded that prior to a demand for the return of the goods and before the Commencement of the Action, the chattels had been taken from the defendant on an Execution against him and sold, so that at the time of such ¶8.

StRep. 786 (1001). demand and C ommencement of the Action, they were not in the defendant’s control, custody or possession. On this concession, the Trial Court dismissed the Complaint and the Judgment entered on such dismissal was affirmed by the Appellate Division. The Court of Appeals stated that the issue pre sented was: whether the defendant was liable in an Action of Replevin for the re covery of chattels after they have been taken from him by process legal as to him and not by any voluntary act on his part? The determination of thi s issue turned, therefore, upon an examination and consider ation of the Action of Replevin as it existed under the New York Code arid Statutes. In affirming the Judgment for defendant, and in speaking for the Court of Appeals, Cullen, J., declared: 82 “Or iginally at Common Law the Action of Replevin lay to recover the possession of goods illegally distrained by a landlord. The primary object of the Action was to recover possession of the specific chattels, The Form of Action was so useful that the action w as extended to nearly all cases of unlawful caption or detention of chattels where it was sought to recover the chattels in specie. In many cases where the plaintiff was unable to obtain the return of the chat tels he could recover in the action their valu e. Still, the action remained essentially one to recover the possession of chattels as distin guished from actions in Trespass or Trover to recover Damages for the seizure or for the value of the property. There were many technical rules in force relating to this Form of Action, which at times made proceedings under it difficult, and in 1788 a Statute was passed in this state (1 Rt.1813, p. 31) to simplify the procedure. It directed the form of plaint before the Sheriff in which the plea was ‘of taking and unjustly detaining’ beasts, goods or chattels. Afterwards, the Revised 82. 165 N.Y. 444, 451, 59 N.E. 265, 207, 53 L,RA. 565, 568, 80 Am,St.Rep. 736, 739 (1901). Sec. 134 ACTION OF REPLEVIN 271 Statutes prescribed the rules governing ac tions of Replevin and the procedure therein. (Title 12, chap. 8, part 3.) In the original note of the revisers is stated their intention to so extend the Action of Replevin ‘as to make it a substitute for Detinue, and a Con current Remedy in all cases of t he unlawful caption or detention of personal property, with Trespass and Prover.’ We do not think the revisers used the term ‘Concurrent’ as meaning ‘Co - extensive,’ for by Section 6, title 12, it is provided that the Action shall in all cases be commenced by Writ, the Form of which is prescribed as follows: ‘Whereas A.B. complains that C.D. has taken, and does unjustly detain (or, “does unjustly detain,” as the case may be).’"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Page 288 of 735 “The Execution in the Action required the Sheriff to Replevin the goods if they c ould be found and deliver them to the plaintiff, and in case they could not be obtained to collect their value with the damages and costs from the property of the defendant. The provisions of chapter 2 of title 7 of the Code of Procedure of 1848, entitled ‘Claim and Delivery of Personal Property,’ operated as a substitute for those of the Revised Stat utes. They direct that at the Commence ment of the Action the plaintiff may replevy the chattels, but in the Affidavit to obtain the writ there is required th e statement that the defendant ‘unjustly detains’ them. The provisions of the present Code of Civil Pro cedure in the article entitled ‘Action to re cover a chattel’ (§ 1689 to § 1730), are sub stantially the same as those of the old Code. “The question s everal times arose, under the Code of Procedure whether Replevin could be maintained against a party who was not in possession, either actual or con structive, of The chattels, and was the sub ject of conflicting decisions in the Supreme Court and in the S uperior Court of New York. It finally came to this Court in Nich - ols v. Michael, (23 N.Y. 264) This was also a ease of fraudulent purchase of goods in which the defendant, before the action was brought, had voluntarily transferred the goods to his assignee . It was held that the Action could be maintained. * * * “It is urged that whatever may have been originally the nature and chara cter of an Action of Replevin, there is now no longer reason for maintaining a distinction between it and an Action for Conversion, and that it would conduce greatly to the speedy ad ministration of justice to permit the use of the first Form of Action as a substitute for the second. A good deal may be said in favor of this claim, great as would be the innovation resulting in its acceptance. There is, however, a serious objection to adopting this view of an Action of Replevin. If a defendant is arrested in an Action to recover a chattel he can be discharged only upon giving a bond for the return of the chattel or the full payment of any judgment that may be recovered against him; while in an Action for Conversion the bond is condi tioned only for his persona l surrender to any mandate or final Judgment against him. (Code Civ. Pro. ~ 575.) The Form of the Action, therefore, seriously affects the rights of the defendant against whom it is brought. While this consideration should not induce us to limit the Scope of an Action of Replevin except within the bounds prescribed by Stat ute and the authorities, it may well restrain us from taking any radical departure in the Law.” sa 83. Section 1093 of the New York Civil Practice Act, which provided that a rleferdnnt, liv answer, could defend on the ground that a third person was enti tled to the chattel, without conncctin~ himself with a latter’s title, was held not applicable to wrongful taking cases; it was applicable to the wrongful de tention cases.

Prima Facie Case in Contract Actions IN Contract Actions the plaintiff’s prima fac - ie case consists in showing the normal affirmative elements of a valid contract and the coming into operation of an affirmative contractual duty; on the other hand, nega tive elements, such as fraud or illegality, which destroy the va lidity of the contract, and Matters of Excuse and Discharge, as impossibility, performance, or release, must come from the defendant, to prevent plain tiff’s recovery. Thus, where the plaintiff has proved the existence of the debt sued on, the burden of pr oving payment is on the defendant. The plaintiff must allege nonpay ment of the money demand to make the Declaration perfect on its face; but payment is an Affirmative Defense, even in many jurisdictions where it may be raised by the defendant under a Deni ai. Thus negative averments may be necessary to the plaintiff’s pleading, though they constitute no part of his original substantive cause of action which he is called upon to prove or establish.

In Actions upon Contracts for Damages, the plaintiff must assign the breach by the defendant which is relied upon as ground for recovery, and allege the essential facts to apprise the defendant in what particulars he has failed to perform. But when the plaintiff pleads or proves the contract, and the fulfillment of conditions to create an operative duty of performance by the de fendant as by tender or performance on his own part, it is then incumbent upon the defendant to prove performance, or sufficient excuse for nonperformance as an Affirma tive Defense, without proof of breach on behalf of the plaintiff. Even the burden of proving the General Allegation of Perform ance by the pla intiff as a Condition Precedent is taken off the plaintiff in Modern English Practice, unless the defendant specially pleads nonperformance of some Condition. As the first of the Contract Actions we shall treat with the Action of Debt, and, as in the case of the Tort Actions, one of our principal considerations is, what facts must be alleged in order to state a good cause of action? SCOPE OF THE ACTION 135. Th e Action of Debt lies where a party claims the recovery of a debt; that is, a liqui dated or certain sum of money due him. The Action is based upon Contract, but the Contract may be Implied, either in Fact or in Law, as well as being Express; and it may be either a Simple Contract or a Specialty. The most com mon instances of its use are for debts: (I) Upon Unilateral Contracts Express or Implied in Fact; (II) Upon Quasi Contractual Obligations having the force and effect of Simple Contracts; (III) Upon Bo nds and Covenants under Seal; (IV) Upon Judgments or Obligations of Record; (V) Upon Obligations Imposed by Stat ute. Sec. 135 ACTION OF DEBT 275 The Action of Debt will not lie: (I) To recover Unliquidated Damages for Breach of a Promise; (II) Nor, generally, to recover an Install ment of a Debt, payable in Install ments before the Whole is Due; (III) Nor on a Promise to pay out of a Particular Fund, or in a Particular Kind of Money, or in Property or Services, The Nature of the Obligation 2 of a Debt, Cawsa Debendi AS Debt was and, in its nature, is a Real Action, the object of which is to recover a yes which belongs to the plaintiff, it is proprietary in character, 3 By this we mean 2. The Action of Debt was the Common Law’s rein edy for the enforcement of its carliest known obli gations. See article by Pollock, Contracts in Early English Law, 6 Harv.L.ltev. 50 (1893). 3, “This Action of Debt was nothing in essence but an action in Detinue for the recovery of money un justly detai ned, together with Damages for the said wrongful detention, such Damages being claimed, not in the Writ, but in the plaintiff’s first count,” See article by Stone, Debt at the Time of the Year Books, 30 L.Qdtev. 61, 62 (1920). See, also, 3 Holds - worth, His tory of English Law, c, Ill, Contract and Quasi - Contract, 425 (3d ed. Boston, 1927). An Action for the Recovery of a Debt was thought of as like an action for the recovery of a book lent, or for the recovery of a plot of land"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Page 291 of 735 which the de fendant unjustly detained from the plaintiff. This crude and primitive Common - Law Conception of Debt, that the creditor was demanding the return of his own money, and that the action was “pro prietary” or “reU,” seems to be somewhat overem phasized by many legal scholars . See article by Henry, Consideration In Contracts, 601 A.D. to 1520 A.D., 26 Yale L.J. 664, 690 — 094 (1017). Debt was indeed a “proprietary action,” in the sense of being the vindication or enforcement of a right. The Judgment was not for Damages for brea ch of promise, but for recovery of the debt itself. Seo Chief Justice vaughan, in Edgeomb v. Dee, Vaugh an 89, 124 Eng.Itep. 984 (1670); Ames, Lectures on Legal History, Lecture XIV, Implied Assumpsit, 148, 150 — 151 (Cambridge 1913). It is said that the duty to restore the money arose not because the debtor had promised or contracted to pay, but because of some transaction, as that he had borrowed It or received value, known as quid pro quo. But the promise or agreement to pay the it d oes not lie for Damages as reparation for a tort, nor does it proceed upon the theory that the plaintiff’s right to recover, or the defendant’s obligation to surrender the prop erty sued for, is grounded upon a promise. The property sought, whether land, a cor poreal chattel, or a sum of money, is de manded because the defendant is withhold ing something which rightfully belongs to the plaintiff. 4 (I) Title as the Basis of the Action of Debt. — Thus, if the plaintiff is to recover, it must be on the basis of some form of title, clear of any claim grounded in tort and in dependent of any promise. There are two possibilities as to such title: (1) where the goods or money in issue were originally the property of the plaintiff and his claim to recover is based on a prior vested interest, price was just as much a part of the debt transac tion as the delivery of the ‘ - es. See article by Hen ry, Consideration in Contracts, 601 A.D. to 1520 AD., 26 Yale Li. 664, 694 (1917), In Debt the word “agreed” must be used ins tead of “promised,” but this is mere form. MeGinnity v. Laguerenne, 5 Gil. (Ill.) 101 (1848). 4. On Debt for the recovery of a specific amount of unaseertained chattels, see Ames, Lectures on Legal History, Lecture VIIJ, Debt, 89 (Cambridge 1913). This a ction gives specific enforcement of the duty to pay. It gives the specific thing demanded, namely, the recovery of a debt eo nomine and in numero, and not merely the recovery of damages. 1 Chitty, Treatise oa Pleading and Parties to Action, with Precedents end Forms, c. II, Of the Forms of Ac tion, 121 (16th Am, ed. by Perkins, Springfield 1876); Tennessee: Thoinpsoa v. French, 18 Tenn. 452 (1837); Virgi,ua: Minnick v. Williams, 77 Va. 758 (1883). The action does not lie for the breach of a sealed con tract to convey land, or to recover purchase money paid. The action being for the breach, and not for a sum of money Co nornin,e and in nurne; - o, it should be Covenant. Haynes v, Lucas, 50 Ill. 436 (1869). It would lie to recover the purchase money as a d ebt arising from the obligation created by law to repay It as money had and received. The terms “sum certain” and debt € 0 nomine and in numero are used to distinguish a claim for a liquidated debt from a claim for unliquidated damages, which are not ascertainable in amount. 276 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 13 as, for example, where A bailed a chattel to B, or B wrongfully took A’s chattel; or (2) where originally the property was the property of the defendant, the present pos sessor, but as a result of the happening of some subsequent event, he ought, debet, to deliver it to the plaintiff who has become entitled to recover it, If the plaintiff’s claim is based on a previously vested title, he is demanding the land, chattel or money as a jus in re, that is, a right which belongs to a person, absolutely and immediately, in a thing; if, however, the plaintiff’s claim is grounded on a right to a thing now in the defendant’s possession, a res which as yet has never been in the plaintiff’s possession, but to w hich the plaintiff, by operation of law is presently entitled, this right of the plaintiff to have the thing is known as a jus ad rem, or a right which belongs to a person only mediately and relatively, and has for its foundation an obligation incurred by a particular person. In the Personal Action of Debt - Detinue, both forms of title were available, that is, the plaintiff in such action might recover because the goods or the money belonged to him originally or because, by operation of law, or otherwise, h e had acquired a right to recover the property which as yet was still in the defendant’s possession. And it was this distinction as to title which ulti mately led to the differentiation between Debt in the Detinet and Debt in the Debet et Detinet; that is, between the situation in which A bailed his horse, Damascus, to B, for thirty days"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Page 292 of 735 and where A loaned .3 $500 for thirty days; in the first case, B acquired possession, but not title, hence when A sues B at the end of the thirty days, after demand, he is relying on a prior vested title, a jus in re; in the second case, B acquired both possession and title, hence when A sued B to recover the ~5O0, he was suing by virtue of an accruing title, a jus ad rem. (II) Debt in the Detinet, or for Goods not Pecuniary. — In theory at least that Form of the Action which lay for the recovery of a certain quantity of specified goods and chattels, may still be maintained upon an Executed Contract. 5 Apparently the last case 5. Debt will lie on any Simple Contract to recover money due upon an Executed Consideration, wheth er the contract is verbal or written, express or un plied. People v. Dummer, 274 Ill. 637, 111 N.E. 934 (1916). Simple Contract Debts, of course, must he found ed on a quid pro quo or Executed Consideration. See ar ticle by Ames, Parol Contracts Prior to Assumpsit, S Harv.L.Rev, 252 (1895). It also lies to enforce a quasi contractual obligation to pay a sum certain. Van Deusen v. 13mm, 18 Pick. (Mass.) 229, 29 A m.Dee. 582 (1836). Debt also lies at the suit of a person entitled to costs in an action, either as a party or as an officer, there being an implied contract. Doyle v. Wilkinson, 220 Iii. 430, 11 N.E. 590 (1887). In Barber v. Chester County, 1 Chest.Co.B ep. (Pa.) 162 (1796), it was said that Debt would lie wherever In debitatus Assumpsit is maintainable.

Sec. 135 ACTION O F DEBT 277 in which Debt was used to recover specific chattels was that of the Earl of Faimauth v. George, 6 decided in 1828, in which the plain tiff sought to recover a certain number of fishes alleged to be due by way of toll for the use by the fishing boats of a capstan which the plaintiff maintained on the shore. The Action was said to be Debt in the detinet, the Allegation that the defendant d ebet, being omitted. In 1769 Blackstone observed that this Form of Debt was “neither more nor less than a mere Writ of Detinue,” and he insisted that nothing but money could constitute a debt, which view has been ap proved by certain American courts. 8 Keig win, however, declares: “As a matter of historical fact, however, Detinue and Debt for goods have always been distinct, the former lying for goods previously the prop erty of the plaintiff, and going upon his jus in re, while Debt in the detinet went for a body of goods to which, as to a sum of money, the plaintiff was entitled, proceeding upon his Debt will lie for the Use and Occupation of land.

Thus generally in all cases where the Consideration has been Executed and where there is an absolute duty to pay In money the value of the performance rendered, there Debt on Simple Contract or Indebi tatus Assumpait is a proper remedy. Debt lies in all cases where the Law Courts can properly give specific performance of a duty to pay money, name ly, where the duty Is an absolute one, not subject to any conditions. •S. 5 Bing. 286, 130 Eng.Rep. 1071 (1 828).

For the plaintiff to recover in Debt, there fore, he must set forth in his Declaration a rig ht to the thing demanded; that such right arises from something other than a promise or voluntary assumption; it must, in truth, be independent of what we now under stand as a contractual obligation. Under the ancient law, matter which created in one perso n a right to something in the possession of another, was called a cau.sa debendi, or “a ground of indebtedness, a basis of the duty to deliver, the origin of an obligation to pay.”” As Pollock and Maitland said: “It enters no one’ s head that a promise is the ground of this action. No pleader pro pounding such an action will think of be ginning his Declaration with ‘whereas the defendant promised to pay,’ he will begin with ‘whereas the plaintiff lent or (as the 0.

Where one of the parties to the Action of Debt died, the Form of Declaring was in Debt in the detinet, not in Debt in the dsbet et detinet. It was said that these distinctions, which re quire the Dcc~ laratlon to be only in the detinet, where one of the original parties died, were held to be substantive as late as 1619. Beynell v.

Clearly A is entitled to recover the steers. But is this so because B has Executed a Con tract Obligating himself to make delivery? Certainly not, and, if this were the only basis of A’s claim, he could not have recovered; the Court might well have told him that he deserved to lose his horse because of his folly in trusting B’s word. In other words, at the time when Debt was reaching ma turity, a parol promise, which sev eral Cen turies later became enforceable in Special Assuinpsit, created no legal obligation; the obligation, if any, was merely moral, and hence"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"Page 294 of 735 not justiciable. In such a case, how ever, A would recover, as B has received a benefit at his expense, and one who profits by the act of another ought, debet, to com pensate that other in a manner commensu rate with the benefit conferred. Or to put it in technical language, B, having received .4’s horse, ought to render a quid pro quo, or the steers, as a balance against the horse, the so - called “Executed Consideration.” Thus, where a Simple Contract has been executed on one side so as to transfer a quid pro quo, or a benefit to the other side, the benefit received creates in the receiver, by operation of Jaw, a le gal duty to render an equivalent benefit to the plaintiff, that is, it creates an indebtedness, which may be regarded as an example of causa debendi. And these causa debendi, vaguely understood in the early stages of development, gradu ally took on definit e form, and were ulti mately clarified la as being derived from three sources, Simple Contracts, Specialties and Records, including Statutes. DEBT — DISTINGUISIIED FROM AND CON CURRENT WITH OTHER ACTIONS 136. Debt was distinguished from Special .Assumpsit in that it Jay for the recovery of a Sum Certain; whereas the latter was for the recovery of Damages; Debt was a concurrent remedy with Indebitatus Assumpsit in the field of Simple (Executed) Contract, but in being available upon Specialties, Records and S tat utes, it was broader than the latter action. Debt and Covenant were concurrent remedies where the Dnmages upon breach of the Sealed Instrument were liquidated. And Debt, Special Assumpsit and Indebitatus Assumpsit were con current remedies, where, over and above a Simple (Executed) Contract, there was also an Express Promise which had been breached. SPECIAL ASSUMPSIT is to be distin guished from Debt, in that it lies for the Breach of a Modern Contract, in which what is recovered is Damages, whereas, w hen we say that Debt lies on a Simple Contract. we are referring to the early Common - Law Concept of what is termed “a Simple Ex ecuted Contract,” which term is descriptive not of a contract in the modern sense, but in the sense that the plaintiff has deliv ered a quid pro quo to the defendant, for which the defendant has failed to pay, or has other wise become indebted to the plaintiff by op eration of law. And it is of course settled, as previously observed, that Debt will not lie upon a promise for a promi se, 14 as in such 12. On the early attempts at classifying the varieties of debt, see Fifoot, History and Sources of the Common Law, e. 10, Debt, 223 (London 1049), in which he cites a ease in which it was said that ‘each writ of Debt is general and in one form, but the count is Special and makes mention of the Con tract, the Obligation or the Record, as the case re quires.” Anonymous.

V, Contract, 210 (Cambridge 1895). Sec. 137 ACTION OF DEBT 279 case there is no quid pro quo passing to the defendant. Debt is to be distinguished from Indebita tus Assurnpsit, being in many respects much broader than the latter action. It is true that Debt and Indebitatus Assumpsit are concurrent remedies in the Field of Simple (Executed) Contract, but Tndebitatus As sumpsit will not lie upon a Sea led Contract, a Record, or, with some exceptions, upon a Statute. In the sense that Indebitatus Assumpsit came to be the remedy for recov ery of Quasi - Contractual Obligations through the use of the Common Counts, it may be said to be broader than Debt. Thi s advan tage was later lessened by the fact that in some jurisdictions Debt also came to be recognized as a Quasi - Contractual Remedy, by a process which is not clear. And, of course, Debt was subject to Wager of Law, whereas Indebitatus Assumpsit was not, and it was this fact which led to the obsolescence of Debt some time after ,Slade’s Case 15 when the Two Actions were concurrent remedies on a Simple (Executed) Contract. Generally, Debt and Covenant are exclu sive remedies, except where the amount of Damages due upon the breach of a sealed instrument are liquidated. In such instance, Debt and Covenant are concurrent remedies; where, however, the Damages upon Breach of a Specialty are unliquidated, Covenant is t he only remedy.’° Finally, under certain circumstances, Debt, Special Assumpsit and Indebitatus Assump Rep. 883 (1704); Hard’s Case, 1 Salk. 23, p1. 3, 01 Eng.Rep. 22 (1690); Rovoy v. castleman, 1 Ld.1taym."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Page 295 of 735 CD, 91 Eng.Rep. 942 (1695); New Jersey: Furman V.

To illustrate, let us suppose that A says to B, “I will de liver ten cords of wood to you at five dollars a cord,” to which B replies, “Go ahead and deliver it and I will pay for it.” A then de livers the wood, but B refuses to pay. Debt will lie, for a quid pro quo — a benefit — has passed from A to B and B has failed to give A what, by operation of law, belongs to him. Indebitatu s Assumpsit will lie as it is a con current remedy with Debt on Simple (Ex ecuted) Contract; and Special Assumpsit will also lie, because over and above the benefit received by B — the delivery of the wood — the defendant B has breached his ex press promise to pay. Thus, Debt, Special Assumpsit, and Indebitatus Assumpsit were concurrent remedies, where, over and above a Simple (Executed) Contract, there was also an Express Promise which had been breached.

The action of Debt lies only for a liquidat ed sum of money; that is, a pecuniary de mand where the amount due is fixed and spe cific or where it can readily be reduced to certainty by a mathematical computation. Blackstone tells us that in an Action of De bt the plaintiff must prove the whole debt he claims, or recover nothing at all, for the debt is only a single cause of action fixed and de termined, and which, therefore, if the proof varies from the claim, cannot be looked up on as the same contract wher eof the per formance is sued for. “If, therefore, I bring an action for £30, I am not at liberty to prove a debt of £20 and recover a Verdict thereon, any more than, if I bring an Action of Detinue for a horse, I cannot thereby re cover an ox.” 20 In Rudd er v. Price, 2 ’ however, Lord Loughborough says, that while the demand in an Action of Debt must have been for a sum certain in its nature, yet it was by no means so necessary that the amount be set out precisely that less could not be recov ered. 22 A promi se to pay so much as certain services or goods were worth would not for merly support a Count in Debt, as the price 20. 3 J3lackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of Eng land, e. 9, Of Injuries to Personal Property, 154 (7th ed.

In Debt on Sinipic (Executed) Contract, the Declaration must allege facts showing that the defendant received a quid pro quo, that is, the receipt of value from which, by operation of law, the debt arises; in addition it must allege, by way of the Breach, Nonpayment of the Debt, and Damages. BE FORE discussing the problem of stat ing a cause of action in Debt as applied to Simple Contracts, it is essential to consid er the distinction between what were called Executed Contracts at Common Law and what are considered as Contracts Under Modem Law; a lso the distinction between Executed and Executory contracts as they originated at Common Law, together with some of the characteristics and peculiarities of each. Thereafter, with an understanding of the source or basis of the obligation sought to be enfo rced, we may intelligently consid er the essential obligations necessary to state a good cause of action in Debt. Executed Contracts BOTH an Executed and an Executory Con tract, if broken, will subiect the parties who commit a breach, to liability, but upon whol ly different theories. Thus, if B agrees to buy certain goods from A, and to pay for the same, if .4. delivers the goods, and B fails to pay for the goods, B is cle arly liable to it, as a matter of morality, but not because of his promise. His obligation is entirely in dependent of the promise, and would be equally binding if there were no promise. But if B refused to accept the goods when delivered, A, the vendor mi ght hold B liable in damages for any loss sustained by reason of B breaking his promise to accept and pay for the goods. The theory of liability in this latter situation is that B has breached his contract, not that B has received anything wifich entitled A to an equivalent amount."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Page 302 of 735 43. Alien t SmIth, 12 N.LL. ISO (1831). Ct. Stephens v. Sweeney, 2 Gil. (Ill.) 375 (1845). 286 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 13 Such Damages will usually be nominal, or at least bear little proportion to the value of the goods which t he vendor sold. In oth er words, as we have seen, prior to the ad vent of Special Assumpsit A would have had no remedy at all where B refused to receive the goods, as a parol promise created no le gal obligations, nor did it give the promisee a right of action for its breach. But prior to Special Assumpsit, under which the ven dor could recover for his loss of a profit re sulting from B’s breach, a purchaser could not take or receive another’s property with out compensation therefor. Such accept ance of goods constituted a cau,sa debendi, upon which the Action of Debt might be sustained. (I) Debt Not in General Available on a Broken Promise.. — Debt, then, was applied to such cases on a theory not generally un derstood by the modern mind. To adapt the Ancient Real Action — the Writ of Right — to the recovery of a loan, sale or other Exe cuted Contract, it was essential to first, estimate the amount owed as a specific sum of money, and second, to impute to the plain tiff a property in that pecuniary res~ by treating the sum owed as a specific piece of property in the hands of the debtor and which, by means of the force and effect of the so - called Executed Contract, had been transmitted to the ownership of the credito r, becoming his, by operation of law, the equiv alent of the quid pro quo which the creditor had transferred to the debtor. And under this theory the law sometimes recognized such reciprocal transfer of title, even where there was no passing of a quid pro quo, as in the case where B bargained to buy a horse from A, the Court held that the property was in B, hence lie was entitled to bring Det lime, where A, the seller, was entitled to have a Writ of Debt for the price. 44 44. Y.B. 20 Henry VI, 35 (1442). Se e, also, a state mont by Mr. Justice Holmes, in 1916, In the ease of In consequence of the foregoing, then, we may say that Debt lies upon what we now refer to as Simple (Executed) Contracts, up on any parol agreement which has been car ried out by the pla intiff in such a manner as to transfer a quid pro quo, goods, labor, or money, to the defendant, so as to entitle the plaintiff to recover the corresponding price which is still in the hands of the defendant debtor. Says Professor Keigwin: “The effi cient fact is the meritorious performance on the one side which — of itself and apart from the agreement — engenders the duty to make recompense for the benefit thereby imparted to the other side. The obligation enforced results from the facts accomplished by the pl aintiff, and is founded upon the emolument inuring to the defendant from the transac tion.” ~ (II) Debt Lies on the Simple (Executed) Contract, Assumpsit on the Promise. — What, then, was meant when it was said that Debt lies on the Contract, Assumpsit on t he Prom ise? ‘° The distinction may be dearly per ceived if we examine the case of Sands v.

Sec. 139 ACTION OF DEBT 297 quested B, an attorney at law, to defend his friend C, who had been sued, and A undertook to pay for the service rendered. B performed the service requested and C, having failed to pay, B demanded payment by A, and upon his"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Page 303 of 735 refusal, sued A in Debt upon his under taking. In the Court of Common Pleas it was held that Debt by B against A would not lie, but that Special Assumpsit would lie on A’s promise to B to pay the debt of C~ Special Assumpsit is the only remedy , the theory being that there was no quid pro quo passing from B to A, and hence no debt. From the result in the Sands case, two in ferences may be drawn, first, that in the le gal mind of the late Sixteenth and early Seventeenth Centuries, the word “cont ract” meant only a Simple (Executed) Contract, which covered factual situations, in which there had been an engagement to swap some thing of material benefit, the effect of which was an emolument moving from one party to the other, as in the instant case, from the attorney B, to his client C; second, a debt could not be created by a promise, where it was made to pay a debt chargeable to an other other than the promisee. In the Sands case the only debt was that created by B’s performance of services to C, wh ich per - forinance, by operation of law, imposed a legal duty upon C to pay B, which was re mediable in Debt by B against A. No debt existed as between B mid A, and A had re ceived no quid pro quo from B. As to A, then, no causa debendi in Debt existed; there was, however, an undertaking which did not involve any benefit to A, the prom isor, but which did involve a breach of prom ise, remediable in Special Assumpsit, and for which the object of the action was the recov ery of Damages and not a Specific Su m Cer tain, as required in Debt. It follows from the foregoing discussion that when there is what we now refer to as a Contract in the early Common - Law sense, there is a Simple (Executed) Contract which involves the performance of meritorious services by one party for the benefit of an other. Even if there be a promise in such case, as there often may be, the Action of Debt which lies, is not grounded upon that promise; indeed, if only a promise existed, without the delivery of some benefit from the plaintiff to the defendant, Debt could not be sustained. (UI) Debt and Special Assumpsit, While Sometimes Concurrent Remedies, are Grounded on Different Theories. — Jt was for this very reason that Special Assum psit was, as we shall see later, developed as a remedy whereby a plaintiff might recover Damages for the breach of an express promise, as in the sale of goods, the loan of money, or the rendition of services of value to the defend ant. Special Assumpsit ma y be concurrent with Debt, where over and above the Simple Executed Contract, performed on one side but not on the other, there is also an Express Promise to Pay, but, in general, the action lies in many factual situations wherein no debt exists. Where con current, it should be observed, that the theory upon which each action proceeds, is different. Debt lies upon the Contract, as conceived by the Common Law, long prior to the emergence of the Mo dern Contract as an incident of the develop ment of Special As sumpsit, and under which the plaintiff seeks recovery of the equiva lent of the benefit or quid pro quo which has passed to the defendant. In such case Debt proceeds independently of any promise to pay, and not upon any promise; Special As sumpsit proceeds upon the theory of the Breach of an Express Promise, and its occa sional concurrence with Debt may be attrib uted to the presence of a Breach of an Ex press Promise over and above a Simple (Executed) Contract as known under the early Common Law. if a prom ise is essen tial to recovery Debt will not lie. This was made clear in Hersey v. Northern Assurance Kofflor & floppy Com.Law Plep. H.5.. — 11 288 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 13 Co.~, 49 in which the plaintiff sought to recov er in two Common Counts in Indebitatus As sumpsit, which became a substitute for Debt, upon a fire insurance policy, under which the Insurance Company undertook to indemnify against loss by fire. The Court held that Debt or Indebitatus Assumpsit would not lie , as the Allegations of Fact, aside from the Express Promise to indemnify in case of loss by fire, were not sufficient to create a Com mon - Law Debt — a Debt created by a Simple (Executed) Contract. Said the Court: “In the present case the facts aside from th e promise, via.: the plaintiff’s ownership of the property, its destruction by fire without his fault — even the payment of the premi - uins, — do not raise an implied promise by the defendant to pay; it is only the fact that it promised, upon certain conditions , to pay, that makes it liable. Consequently, at Com mon Law, the promise, the conditions, and the fulfillment of the conditions, must be set forth — in other words the Count must be special.” ~ And the same rule applies in the case of a wager, a breach of w arranty, or where the vendor fails to deliver the goods to the vendee. 5 °"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Page 304 of 735 In all such cases, nothing of value having passed to the defendant, no debt has been created, or no causa det’endi making it his duty to pay; the remedy in such case is Special Assump sit for the breach of an express promise. 5 ’ 48. 75 V~t. 441, 56 AU. 95 (1903). 49.

For while Assumpsit might al ways be brought where Debt would lie upon a Sim ple Contract, the converse is not true. There were Ex ecutory Contracts WHERE a person promises to perform a certain act and then fails to perform, there is no basis for supporting an Action of Debt. There is no Simple (Executed) Contract, no Specialty Contract, no Judgment and no Statute. The only operative fact fixing lia bility of the contractor is his breach of prom ise. At Common Law, there were two rea sons why a mere Breach of Promise would not support an Action of Debt. In the first place, at Common Law, t he breach of a parol promise, while a lie, and hence immoral, was not regarded as a civil wrong, and therefore there was no remedy provided for breach of a parol promise; in short, the wrong was of such a character as to be not justiciable. However, by a l ong process of development which extended from Watton v. Brinth ~ in 1400, up to Cook and Songate’s Case 53 in 1588, the Action of Special Assumpsit, as a remedy for the Breach of Parol Promises, was created by extending the tort Action of Trespass on the C ase Super Se Assumpsit into the Modem Field of Contract, thus fin ing the lacuna or gap which has been de scribed as a deficiency in the Common Law Scheme of Remedial Justice. 5~ But this de - velopment in no way affected the Nature or Scope of Debt. In the s econd place, Special Assumpsit, as the remedy for the Breach of a Promise, was not proprietary in char acter; the injury to the deceived promisee could not be treated, as in Debt, as a specific res, of either chattels or money, in the pos many cases where Assuinpslt was the only remedy. .Assumpsit would lie both where the plaintiff had incurred a detriment upon the faith of the defend ant’s promise, and where the defendant bad re ceived a benefit. Debt would lie only In the latter class of cases. in other w ords, Debt could be brought only upon a Real Contract, Aasumpsit up on any paroi contract” Ames, Parol Contracts Prior to Assumpsit, 8 Harv.L.Rev. 252 (1894). ~ Y.B. 2 Henry iv, ta. p1. 9 (1400). 63. 4 Leo. 31, 74 Eng.Rep. 708. 64.

If the promisor defendant. was to pay for his breach by mak ing reparation in Damages, it had to be on some other theory than that which existed in Debt, as De bt could not be used as a rem edy to recover Damages for a Breach of Con tract, without destroying its character as a Real Action. (I) The Common Law Versus the Modern Law Meaning of the Term “Uontract”. — As previously suggested, at Common Law, when it was said that Debt lies on a Simple Con tract, it was used to describe transactions not included within the term “Contract” as understood in Modern Law. Originally, it was used in a very narrow sense and to de scribe a Real Contract, under which the de fendan t was, by operation of law, placed un der a duty to recompense the plaintiff in a sum equivalent in value to the quid pro quo received. The Specialty Contract, by way of contrast, was described as a Covenant, Grant or Obligation, but not as a Contract. As Pro fessor James Barr Ames observes: “A Sim ple Contract Debt, as well as a Debt by Spe cialty, was originally conceived of, not as a Contract, in the Modern Sense of the Term, that is, as a Promise, but as a Grant. A bar gain and sale and a loan were exch anges of"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Page 305 of 735 values. The Action of Debt, as several writ ers have remarked, was a Real rather than a Personal Action. The Judgment was not for Damages, but for the recovery of a Debt, regarded as a i - es.” ~° Such a view of the Common - Law Concep tiOn of Contract excludes those factual situ ations where the defendant’s obligation is founded on a mere promise to perform, un accompanied by the receipt of a quid pro ~5 - According to Bovier, Law Oietionary, p. 660, (3rd Rev. PhIladelphia, 1914) Real C ontracts are those in which It is necessary that there be something more than mere conseifi, such as a loan of money, deposit or pledge, which from their nature require a delivery or the thing, v - es. 50. Ames, Lectures on Legal History, Lecture XIV, Implied Assuznpslt 1.~9, 151 (CambrIdge, 1913). quo. The word “Contract” meant an Execut ed Contract, under which a res passed from the plaintiff to the defendant. If the under taking was executory, or dependent alone upon a pro mise, with provision for mutual exchange of benefit, Debt would not lie. Thus, cases involving suretyship or warran ty, were not referred to as contract. And this explains why, as late as 1630, in the case of Sands v. Trevilian, 5 ’ the Court held that a Con tract of Guaranty was unenforceable in an Action of Debt, as the guarantor had re ceived no quid pro quo from the promisee. In consequence, even unto this day, Debt will not lie for the mere Breach of a Promise, and this remains true even where the conside ra tion itself creates an obligation to restore it if the promise be not performed, as where there is a payment on account for goods sold, and there is a failure of delivery. In such case the money paid constitutes a debt for which Debt will lie; ~ but any loss result ing from the failure of the sale is remediable only in Special Assumpsit for Damages, as opposed to Debt for a Sum Certain. And, of course, as previously observed, the ex change of Mutual Promises does not create a Contract upon which Debt wil l lie, as there is no quid pro quo passing to the de fendant; there is, however, a Contract in the Modern Sense, upon the Breach of which Special Assumpsit will lie. (II) Debt Not Available Upon a Collateral Contratt. — The Common - Law Rule was that Debt wou ld not lie upon a Collateral Promise to pay the Debt of Another,~° — a principle 57. Cro.Car. 193, 79 Eng.Itep. 769 58. See Maylard v. Kister, Moore K.li. 711, 72 Eng. Rep. 857 (1598), in which the Court of Queen’s Bench held that Special Assumpsit was not available upon a promise to pay for goods sold and delivered, ‘be cause Debt properly lay, and not an action on the Case [Special Assumpslt], the matter proving a per fect sale and contract.’~ 69. “Thus, In one of the oldest eases upon the sub ject, is Edw - . III, 13 (1344), It is said: ‘If A bought of Inc certain goods for a certain sum, and B at the 290 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 13 established at an early period in the English Law. Thus, Reeves, in his History of English Law,°° commenting on the changes in legal proceedings between the time of William the Conqueror (1066 — 1087) and that of King John (1199 — 1216), declared: “When they (the parties) were both in Court, then it was to be considered how the demand arose. This might be of various kinds, as ex causa mutui, upon a borrowing; a causa venditionis, up on a sale; cx conimodato, upon a lending; cx deposito, upon a deposit; or by some other cause, by which a debt arose; for at this time all matters of Personal Contract were con sidered as binding only in the light of debts; and the only means of recovery, in a Court, was by this action of debt.” In each of these cases the common characteristic was that the consideration passed from the creditor to the debtor, so that the contract of the party receiving the quid pro quo, or benefit, was to pay his own debt and not that of another. Such transactions were in no way connected with third parties; the debtor was the party securing the benefit, lie alone owed the debt and Debt lay only a gainst him. In view of this origin of the action, it is not surprising to find that Debt, as a remedy, had no application, in case of a Breach of Promise to pay money which was primarily due from a third party. In an early case, the law was stated as foll ows: “If C recover £10 against A, and B shall say to C that if he will release the £10 to A he will be his debtor, and accordingly the £10 are released to A, an Action of Debt will not lie against B, as this sounds in covenant.” ~ In"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Page 306 of 735 the subtle theory of t he thy it was held same time undertook to pay for them at the day if A did not; if A should not pay for them, debt could not be brought against B, because it would sound In covenant.’” Beasley, C. 3., In Gregory v.

IV, 425 (Finlason’s .Ani.EL, Philadelphia 1880). that such a promise by B did not create a debt; the party originally liable, A, remain ed the debtor; B, who made himself a Surety did not by that act impose upon himself a debt. It thus appears that the existence of this ancient rule of law has never been denied, although Chief Justice Beasley, in Gregory v. Thompson,° 2 suggests that in some in stances it h as been misapplied. He discusses the Anonymous 63 case, in which it was held that an Action of Debt brought by the payee of a Bill of Exchange against the acceptor, could not be supported, on the ground that the engagement was collateral. Chief Justice Beas ley observes that while this decision has since been overruled in this country, it in no way affected the principal doctrine, as the reversal did not rest on grounds which in volved the doctrine under elucidation. Chitty, a modern English authority, sustai ns the ancient doctrine, declaring: “Where a Simple Contract creates a Collat eral Liability, as for the payment of the debt of a third person, Debt not being sustainable, Assumpsit is the only Form of Action.” ~ The same rule, Chief Justice Beasley ob ser ves, has found sanction in Amer ica in Pierce v. Crafts ~ and Willmarth v. Craw jord7 and the principle is not affected because the engagement sued upon has l~een expressed in an instrument under seal.

The Dec laration alleged that one of the stipulated installments of rent was unpaid. A brought Debt against C, and a Demurrer to the Dec laration was sustained, the Court holding that Covenant under which the defendant C, jointly with another, had undertaken to se cure the payment of an annuity issuing out of the land, was Collateral, and hence would not, support an Action of Debt.° 8 Finally Chief Justice Beasley refused to follow Mr. Justice Story’s suggestion in Bid lard v.

(III) A Single Quid Pro Quo Will Not Cre ate Two Debts. — As previously observed, Debt was not available against a defendant if a benefit was conferred on a third person even though at the defendant’s request, as th ere was no quid pro quo essential to create a debt. As a result, however, of a case de cided during the reign of Henry VI (1422 — 1461),~° it was established that whatever would constitute a quid pro quo, if rendered to the defendant himself, would constitu te a quid pro quo if delivered to a third person, provided it was delivered at the defendant’s request, and that such third person did not become liable therefor to the plaintiff, as one quid pro quo could not give"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Page 307 of 735 rise to two debts. 1 ’ This was the princip le on which 67, 4 \\ l, & \\ V. 130, 150 Eng.Rep. 1372 (1835). 68. 8c~, in this connection, Harrison v.

(IV) The Statute of Frauds and the Rule that Debt Will Not Lie Upon a Collateral Promise. — The principle that Debt will not lie on a Collateral Promise to pay money pri marily due from another is vital when it comes to the application of the Fourth Sec tion of the Statute of Frauds, 73 which pro vided that no action shall be brought upon a promise to answer for the debt of another unless the agreement shall be in ~iting. T he Statute would, of course, have no ap plication except where the promise to pay the debt of another was Collateral and was not in Writing. 74 The Mode of Declaring on Simple Contracts WHERE the action is brought on a Simple Contract Debt, the Declaration must show the Consideration on which such Contract was founded with exactitude, and it must ap pear that there is a liability established either by law or by an express agreement of the defendant. The Form of the State ment should be that the defendant ag reed to pay the debt, and not that he promised; the 72. CroEliz. 880, 78 Eng.Rep. 1104 (1602). See, also, Stonehouse v.

The quantum meruit and quantum valebant Counts were formerly used in Debt, and re sembled those in Assumpsit, except the words “agreed to pay” were used, instead of “promised to pay.” DECLARATION IN DEBT — ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS: (3) IN DEBT ON A SPECIALTY 140. Jn Debt on a Specialty, the deed or instrument relied upon must be stated in the Declaration in precise words, that is, verbatim, or according to its substance and legal ef fect. The Consideration need not be alleged, unless p erformance of it is a condition precedent."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Page 308 of 735 THE second variety of Debt was Debt on a Specialty, or upon an instrument under seal, which in the English law was known as a Formal Contract. It fixed an obligation in either one of two forms: (1) such an instru ment might declare that an indebtedness is a presently existing fact; or (2) it might assure that a specified sum of money would be paid in the future. Regardless of whether the instrument took on a present or future aspect, if the obligation created was to ren der a specific, certain sum of money to the promisee or obligee, the Action of Debt lay to recover the specific res mentioned in the instrument, and as indicated by the instru ment to be the property of the obligee to whom payment is thereby assured . As the implications of an instrument creating a Present Obligation under a Seal were differ ent from those created by a Future Obliga tion under Seal, each will be considered separately. A Sealed Instrument Fixing a Present Obl~ gation SEALED instrumen ts creating a Present Obligation might take the form of a bond to pay a specific sum of money, as on a single or common money bond, with out any condition, or they may take the form of a bond with a penalty or with a collateral condition. In each case the debt was creat ed by the act of the parties to be charged in executing the instniment under seal which is the basis of the suit. Thus, where a bond is drawn in the conventional form and for the purpose of securing the payment of money, it purports and ackn owledges that the obli gor or the person who signs and seals the in strument is “to be held and firmly bound to the said” ohligee, or the said “plaintiff” in a specific and certain sum of money, which is to be paid to the said plaintiff (obligee), or his p ersonal representatives at once or upon de mand or at some fixed date or upon the hap pening of some contingent act or event. The phrase “to be held and firmly bound to the said plaintiff,” as it appears in the Declara tion imports an obligation on the par t of the obligor to render the specific thing — the in debtedness — to the obligee, and such lan guage executed under seal amounts to a con clusive declaration by the person who thus acknowledges his indebtedness that he has in possession money which belongs t o the ob ligee and which he ought to deliver to him. If the obligor fails to perform the duty to pay, as undertaken under seal, an Action of Debt on the bond lies to recover the money specified in the instrument, the theory being that the obligee or plaint iff is the owner of the specific sum designated and hence is 75. MeGinnity v. Laguerenne, 10 Dl. 101 (1848). Sec. 140 ACTION OF DEBT 293 merely seeking that which belongs to him as provided in the bond. And such an acknowl edgment under seal of indebtednes s by the obligor is conclusive, even where there was in fact no pre - existing debt, or where the debtor - obligor had no property which be longed to the obligee. The reason for this was that such an acknowledgment of indebt edness, when widened by the solemn act of seal, operated as an estoppel, at least in a Court of Law; and it had the practical ef fect of barring the obligor from denying what he had previously so solemnly admit ted, thus placing the matter beyond dispute and eliminating any necessity of inquiry as to the nature and origin of the debt; and in short, under such an obligation, the issue as to how the debt arose, became immaterial. By reason of the peculiar characteristics of the sealed instrument creating a present ob ligation, it became possible for the obligee to use this form of instrument to obtain a bene fit from the obligor which was clearly some thing other than the payment of a debt. Thus, suppose B, the obligor, executes a bond agreeing to pay the obligee, A, a certain sum of money. In effect the in strument becomes evidence of an absolute indebtedness. Now, suppose there is added to this instrument a condition in the form of a clause providing that the entire instru ment should be void if the debtor - obligor, B, performs some other act, such as indemnif y ing the obligee against certain contingencies, answering for the defaults of some third person, conducting himself in the proper and legal manner in some public office, paying a smaller sum of money, or performi ng a col lateral contract. If the obligor, B, performs the condition set forth in the contract, the condition is said to have been fulfilled, with the result that there is nothing due on the bond; that is, the bond is void. If, however? the obligor, B, fai ls in any manner to meet the conditions as set forth, the bond is converted to an obligation as absolute in character as it was upon its original execution, with the result that the obligee, A, may sue in Debt to recover the sum specified in the bond as a conc]usively acknowledged debt."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Page 309 of 735 In such an instance, what the bonl secured was not the sum certain as a debt, but an agreed penalty or Liquidated Damages for ~~tilure to do someting other than paying the debt. Thus, it becomes apparent that the obligor’s acknowledgment of an obligation to pay a specific sum, was, in reality “a cloak to disguise a collateral undertaking; and when the obligee sues on the bond for the amount therein acknowledged to be due, what he actually goes for is not a debt but Dam ages for the nonperformance of the contract contained in the condition.” ‘~ And under the Common Law, as the Breach of a Con dition operated to convert the indebtedness into the absolute obligation it purported to be, the obligee, A, recovered the full amount p re scribed by the bond, in total disregard as to the circumstances under which or the rea son why the obligor failed to perform or the extent of the damage suffered by the obligee A, which, in some instances, was outrageous ly small. Thus, to illustrate, s uppose B, the obligor, by bond, acknowledges an indebted ness to A, the obligee, of $10,000, with a con dition that the bond is to be void upon the payment of $5,000 on a day certain. If, for any reason whatsoever, B failed to pay on the specified date, th e larger amount became absolutely due. And, if thereafter, the obli gor offered to pay the smaller sum, the amount, let us say, actually owed, his tender was of no avail. A Sealed Instrument Fixing a Future Obliga tion WHERE a sealed instrument contains an agreement to perform a certain act at a fu Is. See Kelgwin, Cases in Common - Law Pleading, e.

If, how ever, the sealed instrument had provided for the payment in the future of a specified sum of money, there is a suggestion of a pre - ex isting duty, the money promised presumably being in discharge of a present debt, as for a loan or for goods, which consti tute a causa debendi. 77 By the mediaeval mind, such a promise was conceived of and treated as a present Grant of the specified sum, or a transfer of the title to the plaintiff obligee, which created a debt in the present, but a debt which was to be paid in the future. In other words, B’s agreement to pay A a specific sum of money next year, makes A the owner of that sum at once, even though A may make no claim of the property until the day speci fied. Thus, in the Early Law, it was thought that an Agreement by Specialty for the pay ment of money on a Future Day, in effect, operated as an immediate transfer of title to the sum mentioned, whereby the plaintiff obligee was authorized, upon the arrival of the date specified, or the event designated, to demand th e specified sum as his own. Debt on Specialty, therefore, is the proper remedy to recover a certain and fixed sum of money, made payable by a sealed instru ment, and which under the language of the engagement, is not something other than the debt of the ob ligor. As Professor Keigwin so truly observes: “When, therefore, Action was brought upon a Specialty obligating the defendant to a future payment, the plaintiff did not sue to enforce performance of an Ex ecutory Engagement, but to recover a spe cific sum to which the title had become vest 71.

It is necessary, however, where performance of the Consid eration by the plaintiff is a Condition Pre cedent to his right to sue, to allege Fulfill ment of the Conditio ns to defendant’s liabil ity. 89 The Statement of the Specialty must be a correct description of it, as to time, par ties, etc.; mid it must appear, either by Ex press Allegation or by the use of descriptive words importing the fact, that it was under seal. 81 If not set out verbatim, it must be stated according to its legal operation awl effect. 82 It must appear that the contract IS.

ACTION O F DEBT 295 Sec. 141 was by deed, and it is a general rule, as we shall hereafter see, that Prof ert of the deed must be made, unless it is in possession of the adverse party or lost or destroyed. 83 In an Action upon a Penal Bond, it was formerly the practice for plaintiff to set out only the defendant’s obligation to pay the penalty, without mentioning the Condition Subsequent which it was the object of the bond to enforce. The defendant, if he thoug ht he was able to prove performance of the Con dition, would then crave Oycr of the Con clition and Plead Pert onnance, and the plain tiff would Reply, Assigning Breaches of the Condition. 84 Upon a Penal Bond the Real Cause of Action is the Breach of the C ondi tion Subsequent. It is in effect a Covenant to Perform the Condition of the Bond. The Ac - tion is only in Form for a Debt, which is recited by way of penalty, and in reality is an Action for Damages for Breach of Contract. Contrary to the situation at Common Law, described above, where the fuJi penal sum was always obtained if the defendant had failed to perform the condition, now only the Actual Damages can be collected. By statute the plaintiff is usually required to Assign the Breaches Complained of in his Declaration, and the defendant may then meet them in his Pleas. Although Judg ment may still be entered for the penalty of the bond, this stands merely as security for the Damages caused by the Breach of Con dition as found by the Jury. 83 Wend.

Such statutes custom arily provide that the Forfeited Articles shall pass to the informer, to the officer detecting the offence, or to the Government,. - . -- the effect of such provision being to transfer to such person the title to the property in question. Upon the violation of this type of statute, the property of the offender is held without any further right in the offender, but as ‘the property of the per son to whose benefit it accrues under the terms of the statute. The same rule applies where the statute provides for the Forfeiture of a certain sum of money, the pecuniary amount as a penalty being assimilated to a corporeal chattel, the title to which, by force of the statute, has passed from the wrong doer to the person designated to take under the Statute.

In Debt on a Judgment, where the Ac tion is based on a Judgment obtained in a Court of Record, no statement of the cause of action on which the Record was founded is necessary; the statement should c onsist of a Description of the Judgment, which may be in a concise form, and need not state in full the previous proceedings in the Action in which it was obtained. In General IN a Court of Record, according to a “for mulary of immemorial usage,” °~ a Fi nal Judgment declares that “it is considered that the plaintiff do have and recover of the de fendant” a certain sum of money or a spe cific chattel; that is, the Judgment merely determines the matter of right between the parties, under which the plaintiff is to re gain"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Page 313 of 735 something which already belongs to him and which is wrongfully possessed by the defendant. What the language of the Judgment imports, and what the Judgment does, is to establish the plaintiff’s title to a specific chattel or to a certain sum of money. In like manner, a Recognizance, whereby one person enters upon the records of a court an acknowledgment of his indebt edness to another, is treated as creating a legal obligation on the part of the de fendant to pay the debt admitted to be due. And so, in any case where the indebtedness is demonstrated by a Record, the Action of Debt, because of its proprietary Char acter, was peculiarly appropriate as a rem edy whereby the plaintiff could recover mon ey manifested to be his property. Thus, a Ju dgment for a sum of money ad judged by the court to be due from the de fendant to the plaintiff in any Former Ac tion, is a Debt of Record; that is, a sum of OS. 5ee Keigwin, Cases in Com,non - Law Pleading, Bk. 1, The Forms of Action, c.

This is an obligation of the highest nature, being estab lished by the adjudication of a Court of Rec ord. An Action of Debt was the only means for the enforcement of a Judgment after a Year and a Day had elapsed from the time of its recovery. Alter such time Execution could not issue thereon, as the Judgment wa s presumed to be satisfied. So that, if one has once obtained a Judgment against another ‘for a certain sum, and neglects to take out Execution thereupon, he may afterwards bring an Action of Debt upon this Judgment, ‘and shall not be put upon.the Proof of the Original Cause of Action; but, upon show ing the Judgment once obtained, still in force, and yet unsatisfied, he is entitled to a New Judgment for the debt. Debt thus lies on any obligation of Record to pay money. 99 It lies, for instance, on a Domest ic Judgment of a Court of Record, and on the Judgment of a Court of Record of a sister state, which is generaly regarded as a Specialty. 1 Debt will lie on a Judgment of 99.

Woodworth, 4 Com. 249). * * “The counsel for the defendant insisted that the statement that there is “due,” &c., did not amount to a statement that the debt had become payable; that it meant no more than the statement that the defendant is “indebted,” &c., and that if the word “due” had two significations, the pleader could not select between them, and impute to it the one which suits his purpose best; for the maxim was that everything should be taken most strongly against the pleader, o r if the meaning of the words be equivocal and two meanings present themselves, that construc tion shall be adopted which is most unfavor able to the party pleading. In the case of United States v. State Bank of North Caro lina (6 Pet. 29), Judge Story sai d that the term “due” was sometimes used to express the mere state of indebtment, and then it was an equivalent to owed or owing, and it was sometimes used to express the fact that the debt had become payable. In the latter sense, I think that the word “du e” was used by the pleader in the complaint in this suit, and in that sense it may be deemed to have been used.”” Five years later, in 1857, in the famous case of McKyring v. Bull,’ 2 the status of the 11. Allen & Carpenter v. Patterson, 7 N.Y. 470 (1852) . 12. 16 New York 297, 69 Am.Dee. 000 (1857). Action of Debt or its substitute, the Action of Indebitatus Assumpsit, came up again. The plaintiff brought an action under the Code, equivalent at Common Law, to an Ac tion of Debt or Indebitatus Assumpsit, i n which he alleged that, as an employee of the defendant, he had performed certain labor and service, which were the sum of ~65O, and concluded as follows: “There is now due to this plaintiff, over and above all pay ments and offsets, on account of said wo rk, the sum of one hundred and thirty - four dol lars, which said sum defendant refuses to pay; wherefore plaintiff demands Judgment in tins action” &c. The defendant pleaded a General Denial. At the Trial the defendant offered evidence of payment as a Defen se to the Ac tion, which was objected to and excluded on the ground that it should have been pleaded. The Jury found a Verdict for the plaintiff, upon which Judgment was entered. The de - fendant, having made out a Bill of Exceptions, the Judgment on Appeal was affirmed by the Superior Court at General Term. In affirm ing the Judgment, the Court of Appeals, speaking through Selden J., declared: “Although the Code of Procedure has abro gated the Common - Law System of Pleading, with all of its technical rules, yet, in one respect, the new system which it has intro duced bears a close analogy to that for which it has been substituted. The general denial allowed by the Code corresponds very nearly with the General Issue, in actions of"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Page 316 of 735 As sumpsit and of Debt on Sim ple Contract, at Common Law. The decisions upon the sub ject, therefore, in the English courts, al though not obligatory as precedents since the changes introduced by the Code, will nevertheless be found to throw much light upon the question presented here . “While the General Issue, both in As sumpsit and Debt, was, in theory, what the general denial allowed by the Code is in fact, viz., a simple traverse of the material allega tions of the Declaration or Complaint, yet, Sec. 143 ACTION OF DEBT 301 from the different phraseology adopted in the Two Forms of Action, a very different result was produced. The Declaration, in Debt, averred an existing indebtedness, and this amount was traversed by the plea of nil debet, in the present tense; hence, noth ing could be excluded which tended to prove that there was no subsisting debt when the suit was commenced. In Assumpsit, on the contrary, both the averment in the Declara tion and the traverse in the plea were in the past, instead of the present tense, and related to a time anterior to the commence ment of the suit. Under non assumpsit, therefore, so long as the rule of pleading which excludes all proof not strictly within the issue was adhered to, no evidence could be received except such as would tend to show that the defendant never made the promise. That this was the view taken of these pleas, in the earlier cases, is clear.” Judge Selden observes, however, that con trary to this view in the earlier cases, a prac tice grew up for centuries under which e vi dence was received of payment, and other special defences under the plea of non as sumpsit, as well as nil debet. But, he points out, this practice was swept away under the rules of Hilary term, adapted under the au - thority of the act of 3d and 4th Will iam IV., ch. 42, § 1, under which the plea of nil debet was abrogated, and that of non assumpsit re stored to its earlier status. And, guided by this fact, Judge Selden concludes: “My conclusion therefore is, that neither payment nor any other defence, wh ich con fesses and avoids the Cause of Action, can in any case be given in evidence as a defence, under an answer containing simply a General Denial of the Allegations of the Com plaint.” 13 Finally, we come to the case of Stinson v. Edgemoor Iron Works,” a 1944 Federal case U. MeKyrlng v. Bull, 16 N.Y. 297, 298, 299, 69 Sm. Dee. 006, 697, 704 (1857). ‘4. 53 F.Supp. 864. involving diversity of citizenship jurisdiction, and decided u nder the Delaware Law. The plaintiff alleged that he was employed by the defendant for one year from February 22, 1943, under a contractual arrangement reach ed on March 12, 1943, but retroactive to Feb ruary 22, 1943, at an annual salary of $8,200; that t he defendant breached the contract by wrongfully discharging the plaintiff on March 17, 1943, whereby he became entitled to dam ages in an amount representing the balance of his unpaid salary, the amount of which is $6,491.65. The defendant Moved to Dismis s the Complaint on the ground that the plain tiff had failed to state a cause of action. In denying the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, the United States District Court declared: “The Delaware System of Pleading and Practice is presently that which prevail ed in England at the time of the separation of the Colonies. Whatever may have been the changes in the Action of Debt in other states, that Action in Delaware remains today as it was at Common Law in England even prior to the adoption of the Hilary Rules i n 1834. It is very clear that the Action of Debt as developed in England prior to the Hilary Rules of 1834 could not be used to recover Damages for breach of an employ ment contract. In such suits the amount of Damages — in accordance with the test set forth in the Delaware case of Ogden - Howard — is necessarily uncertain and unliquidated. The amount of such Damages can only be ascertained by Judgment of the Court or by Verdict of a Jury after the consideration of many factors. The Delaware authorities re asser t the principle that an Action of Debt will not lie, unless the demand is for a sum certain, or for a pecuniary demand which can readily be reduced to certainty by com putation. No Delaware case has been found which even hints that its Courts are disposed to deviate from the limitations of the Action of Debt as They existed in England at the time of the Revolution. Delaware inherited 302"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Page 317 of 735 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 13 from England the law relative to an Action of Debt, and that law remains in force until it is changed by the Delaware Courts or its Legislature. In fact, there have been no changes in the Delaware law relative to Actions of Debt, except in one instance. In 1933 the Legislature of the State of Dela ware, Laws of Del., Vol. 38, Chap. 201, abol ished the distinction between an Action of Covenant and one of Debt. But only to this limited extent has the original Action of Debt been changed from its formal status at Common Law and this was apparently found necessary by the enactment of a spe cific statute for this particular purpose. * . * “Viewed against the Historical Develop ment of the Action of Debt, it is apparent that Debt would not lie in Delaware to re cover Damages or compensation for breach of an employment contract regardless of the Allegations in the Declaration. I consequent ly think it clear that Ogden - Howard Co. v. Brand, supra, merely held that an Action of Debt was not the proper Form of Action, and consequently there is no basis for de fendant’ s contention that there are addi tional holdings implicit in that decision. The precise problem before me is, therefore, the simple one of whether the Complaint filed in the instant case is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civ il Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following sec tion 723c. I think it sufficient — especially, since the rules are to be construed to ‘se cure the just, speedy, and inexpensive deter mination of every action.’ Here, the plain - tiff, after stating the existence of a c ontract of employment and a discharge without cause by the defendant - employer, alleges: ‘8. By reason of Defendant’s said breach of its contract with Plaintiff, Plaintiff is en - titled to Damages from Defendant in an amount representing the balance of Plain tiff’s unpaid salary under his said contract with Defendant, the amount of which is the sum of $6,491.65 * .‘ I think this is a perfectly adequate and clear allegation and one that satisfies the requirement of Rule 8.” ~s 15. Stinson V. Edgenloor Iron Wo rks, Inc., 53 F.Supp. 864, 867, 868 (1944). In the case of Williamson v. Columbia Gas and Elec tric Corporation, 110 F (2cl) 15, decided in 1939 the Circuit Court of Appeals took notice of the formal view of Delaware on the Action of Debt, as applied to t he Delaware statute of Limitations. Chief Jus tice Maria declared: ‘In order to apply a statute of Limitations, such as that of Delaware, which reads in terms of Common Law Actions, to a Civil Action brought in a Dis trict Court, it is necessary for the co urt through a consideration of the nature of the Cause of Action disclosed in the Complaint to determine the Form of Action which would have been brought upon it at common Law. It is evident that the complaint in the ease before us discloses a Cause of Act ion which, under the Common Law of Delaware, would be enforceable in an kction on the Case and not in an Action of Debt on a Specialty. The District Court, therefore, properly held that the action was barred by the Delaware Statute of Limitations?’ And thi s was the view taken despite the plaintiff’s contention that since the “Civil Action” provided for by the Federal Rules of civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following Section 723c, had abolished all distinc tions in the Forms of Action, the State Statutes of Li mitations based upon differences in Forms of Ac tion no longer apply.

A Covenant of quiet enjoyment is an illustration of a Covenant for cometb ing in the future. Srndy v. Spurek, 27 Ill. 478 (1861). And any promise under seal, whether to pay money, or to do some other act, or to forbear from doing some act, is such a Cove nant, liquidated, so that Debt will lie, the plaintiff may nevertheless bring Covenant instead, for the remedies are concurrent; but if the sum, the payment of which is secured by a Writing under Seal, is unllquidated and uncertain in amount, Covenant is the onl y remedy for its recovery.” Indeed, since Assumpsit will not lie for Breach of a Contract under Seal, it follows that Covenant is the only remedy to recover unliquidated Damages for the Breach o.f a Contract under Seal. COVENANT - . - DISTINGUJSIJED FROM AND CONCURRENT WITH OTHER ACTIONS 145. Covenant may be distinguished from Debt, as it lies only on an instrument under Seal, whereas Debt lies upon a Statute, a Rec ord, a Simple Contract and on a Specialty. Where the Damages are liquidated upon Breach of a S ealed instrument, Debt and Covenant are concurrent remedies; but where the Damages are unliquidated only Covenant will lie. Special Assumpsit and Covenant are in no instance con current, but Covenant and Case are as against a tenant for yeas’s who committe d Waste. THE Action of Covenant is distinguishable from Debt in that it lies only on a sealed instrument, whereas Debt lies upon a Statute, a Record, and a Simple Contract, as well as a Specialty. Covenant may be brought for the payment of uncertain as we ll as certain sums of money, and for the non - performance of Covenants to do or not to do any other lawful thing. As we have seen, Covenant and Debt became concurrent remedies on all Sealed Instruments upon the Breach of which the Damages were liquithted. 11. Alabama: Jackson v. Waddill, 1 Stew.

In this connection, it should be remembered that Covenant, as a remedy on a Sealed Instrument, gave the plaintiff a remedy of a higher nature than Specia l As sumpsit.’ 3 Covenant and Case in the Nature of Waste were concurrent remedies. Thus, in Kinly side v. Thornton,’ 4 an Action on the Case in the Nature of Waste was permitted even though it was clear there was a Covenant not to commit waste.

In a majority of the states the effective ness of the seal has been abolished or sub stantially modified by Statute. in a jurisdiction where the seal has retained its effectiveness, and the Code has been adopted, there is some authority to the eff ect that where the action of Covenant was the proper action at Common Law, the allegations in an action under the Code must be such as would have supported the Common Law action of Covenant. IN a majority of the states, the effective ness of the private s eal has been abolished or substantially modified by Statute. 29 The change in effectiveness of the seal raises questions in pleading which, although not related to the Codes, are nevertheless of considerable importance in Modern Practice, For example, in Ro ndot v. Rogers) 5 ° the Michigan Court held that the purpose of a Michigan Statute which provided that no deed was to be deemed invalid for want of a seal, “was to permit parties intending to make a deed or specialty to have the writing signed by them, thoug h without a seal, treat ed in law as a deed or specialty; and there fore that covenant might be maintained thereon.” 22.

Agents charged with handling for profit money or goods, or collecting rents and profits from another’ s land, such as Bailiffs, Partners, Factors, Commission Merchants, Executors, Trustees, and Guardians, come under a legal obligation to render an account of the capital (corpus) and proceeds which they receive on behalf of their principal. The Obligation t o Account is thus one which the law im poses independently of contract. It is not founded on promise, but on the existence of a relationship of fact, namely, the being intrusted with the handling of property be longing to another. This obligation was recognized by the Ancient Common Law and was enforced by the Action of Account. Owing to defects of legal procedure, this action was later super seded by the Action for Money Had and Re ceived and by Bill in Equity. In the Action of Acc ount the amount of money claimed is uncertain and unliquidated, but by an ac - counting before Auditors the balance due is ascertained and declared by the Judgment of the Court as a Debt. Account is the proper form of action when one has received money or p roperty for the use of another for which he should account to the latter, 3 or where two persons are part ners in a mercantile adventure.~ “It is said of this action that it is one of antiquity, and lies at Common Law against Guardians, Bailiffs, Receivers, and Mercantile Copart 3 - English: Harrington v.

The action will only lie where the amount sought to b e recovered is uncertain and un liquidated. tt If the mutual debits and credits of the parties have been ascertained, or an account has been stated between them, As sumpsit or Debt, and not Account, is the proper remedy to recover the definite balance due. 1 2 In some cases Assumpsit or Covenant may be Concurrent Remedies with this Form of Action; but Debt can never be so, for account will never lie where the object of the suit is the recovery of a sum certain.

Though it is Commenced like them, the Judgment is first rendered upon the liability to account, quod computet, which is an Interlocutory Judgment only. 13 The Court thereupon appoints Auditors or Arbitrators, whose business it is to take and report the account between the parties, with the balance due, and upon their report the Final Judgment is rendered.

The Action of Account should be dis tinguished from an Action for an Accounting, which was Equitable in character, and from the Action on an Account, which might be in Debt or Indebitatus Assurnpsit. It is concurrent in certain situations with Debt, Detinue, Indebita tus Assumpsit, and a Bill for an Equitable Ac counting. THE Action of Account, at Common Law, was available against a Bailiff, Guardian or Receiver, or any person who received money or other goods to be used for an other’s benefit and in due time accounted for. 15 As the Action of Debt finally develop ed, it became a Concurrent Remed y with Account, and as Indebitatus Assumpsit was a Substitute for Debt in the Field of Debt on Simple Contract, it also became a Con - 14 - Per a ease in which the procedure in an Action of Account is shown in all its technicality, see Willson v. Willson, 5 NIL. 791 (1820), in wluch Kilpatriek, C. J., observes: “This is a Writ of Error to Gloucester Pleas, In an Action of Account. This Form of Action, is, in itself, very difficult, dilatory, and expensive; it has long since fallen into disuse, in a great mea sure, in England; amid in New Jer sey, I have never known, or heard of, more than two or three eases, either in my own time, or before; and I doubt whether even they were carried through to Finni Judgmeat. Hence, we have but few prece dents to guide us in a suit of this kind, and these few, of pretty ancient date; not very intelligible, nnd still less applicable, at this day. In most in - stances, therefore, the Action on the Case, which is simple, easy and well understood, has taken the place of this, in the Common Law Courts, and when that did not afford a complete remedy, resort has been had to Equity, where confidential concerns and trusts of this kind, are more properly cognEzable. Still, however, like all other actions, It is open to all; and In some cas es, where the expense of a Court of Chancery would be too heavy for the sub ject - matter, as It must be confessed, under Its pres ent establishment, it frequently woul4 be, It may, also be necessary.” current Remedy with Account. 1 ° And in the field of Bailm ents Detinue and Account be came Concurrent Remedies for the Bailor. To avoid the delay incident to the Action of Account and to keep the business of ac counting in mercantile matters within the jurisdiction of the Common Law Courts, where there was an ex press promise to ac count, an Action of Trespass on the Case on promises, for the refusal to account, was sanctioned. 17 And, as a matter of principle it was urged that Case would also lie where the obligation to account was raised by oper ation of law. 18 M artin states that it has been doubted whether the law raises an implied promise on the part of an agent or factor to account,’° but feels there is no sufficient rea son against it.20 When the action fell into disuse, its func tion was largely taken over b y the Equitable Bill for an Accounting, the Court of Equity affording a more flexible machinery for the handling of Complicated accounts, in the Form of Discovery before a Master, who possessed power to examine the Witnesses under Oath, to compel the produ ction of books and documents, to pass upon disputed 1~ - See article by Langdell, A Brief Survey of Equity Jurisdiction, 2 Harv.L.Eev. 75, 57 (18%).

STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES OF COURT 161. While the Common - Law Action of Ac count, i n theory at least, has been abolished, the Conunon Law Liability to Account has not been abolished. It may, therefore, be enforced, in some states by a legal action to compel an accounting, in which case the Allegations are essentially the same as at Commo n Law; in others the liability may be enforced by a Bill for an Equitable Accounting. In general, this Mode of Procedure is favored, being more flexi ble in character. WHAT, then, in the light of the foregoing discussion, is the present status of the Acti on 28. Sturges V.

In reversing The Judgment the Court re marked: “At the time of the beginning of t his suit, this form of remedy was open to the plaintiff, and as he has seen proper to adopt it, we are bound to sustain him.” 3~ And in a subsequent case, Sandwich Mfg. Co. v. Bogie, 32 decided in 1927, and under the Code, the Missouri Supreme Court held t hat the original claim was in the nature of an Action of Account, and an additional and different cause of action could not be subse quently commenced, as, under the facts of the case, it would have resulted in a circum vention of the Statute of Limitation s. In re ferring to the Action of Account, the Court declared: “The relationship disclosed is that of agent and manager of a business — a branch office of the claimant at Kansas City.

The facts pleaded in the original claim bring it within thc old Common - Law Action of Account. This was, as said, a Common Law Action, so the referee is ri ght in calling it an Action at Law. Our Practice Act has left us a more limited number of actions, and trials are had of each in the same Court, but the distinction between Common - Law and Equitable Actions are recognized as before. In fact, our several Pra ctice Acts have placed accounts (the items of which are legal as distinguished from Equitable) on the law side of our Courts, there to be tried: (1) By the Court without a Jury, under named circumstances, (2) to be tried by a Jury, or (3) to be tried by a Referee.” ~"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Page 333 of 735 In short, then, despite the fact that the Code had abolished the Common - Law Action in favor of a single, formless form of action, the liability to account, as existing at Com mon Law still remained enforceable under the Code and at Law. It fol lowed, therefore, that the Essential Allegations as required at Common Law, were still required under the Code, perhaps without some of the detail and technicality which prevailed at Common Law. 33.

The term “Special Contract” is often used to denote an Express or Explicit Contract as contrasted with a Promise Implied in Law. TIlE Action of Assumpsit, or Trespass on the Case in Assumpsit, is so called from the word “Assumpsit”, which means that he undertook or promised, which, when the Pleadings were in Latin, was inserted in the Declaration as descriptive of the defend ant’s undert aking. 2 It is a proper Remedy for the Breach of any Simple or Unsealed Contract, whether the Contract is Verbal or Written, or whether it is for the payment of money, or for the performance of some other act, as to render services or deliver goods, or for the forbearance to do some act. 3 In no case will the action lie unless there has been an actual contract or promise, or unless the law will imply one; for a prom ise either given in fact or implied by law is essential. 4 The Action of Covenant hardened bef ore it could be extended to unwritten agreements, even when made upon valuable considera tion, and until near the end of the Fifteenth Century such pacts found no remedy. 2. 1 Chitty, Treatise on Pleading and Parties to Ac tions with Precedents and Forms, c.

Walker & Mosby, 122 Va. 465, 06 S.E. 434 (1918). Prior to the Sixteenth Century the Law of Contracts rested on the foundations of Debt, Covenant and Account, but for the development of this branch of the law they proved entirely inadequate, It remained for the Action of Special Assumpsit to supply the Remedy for Breach of Simple Contracts, and its extension is largely the history of the Substantive Law of Contract. The theory was that when a man undertook by promise to do something and then did it improperly, or where he obtained something by a promise and thereafter broke his promise, Writs of Trespass on the Case were allowed for the wrong done. 5 The Action of Assumpsit, in its broadest sense, was thus developed from the analogies of Actions Ecr Delicto rather than the anal ogy of Covenant, Debt, or any Action Ex Contractu. What the partic ular analogies were that the Courts strained to transform a tort remedy into a contract remedy in the law of obligations hardly con~rns us here.

It is interesting to compare the evolution of Assumpsit with that of Detinue, which started with a Contractual Theory, and, as it developed, invaded the Field of Tort, although it still retained some of its Contractual characteristics. The Action of Covenant enforced prom ises made in writing under Seal simply as promises, expressed in such form as to be binding. The Acti on of Assumpsit as final ly developed enforces promises, not because they are promises, but only when they are based on Consideration. The Action of Debt on Simple Contract enforced a duty to pay for an equivalent already received. But in the Simple Contra ct the obligation is based on the promise, not upon receipt of the quid pro quo, and it is now immaterial whether or not one side of the Consideration has been executed. This Action of Assumpsit supplied the much - needed remedy for the re covery of unliquid ated Damages for the vie lation of Express Contracts not under Seal. A great development took place by the ex tension of this action, by means of an Implied or Fictitious Promise, to debts and to obliga tions in the nature of debt arising from the receipt of benefits or value. This Form of the Remedy is distinguished as General As sumpsit; the original Form of the Action upon an Actual Promise being called Special Ass umpsit. 4. Miller v. Ambrose, 3~ App.D.C. 75 (1910). It nppenrs that the Nonperfonnance of Promises be came actionable in the first part of the Sixteenth Century, or to be specific~ in 1505, when money or something of value was obtained by the Fromisor on the faith of his Promise. Accordingly, we find the Language of the Declaration in Specia l As sumpsit to read: “Yet the said defendant, not re garding his said promise, but contriving and fraud ulently intending, craftily and subtly, to deceive and defraud the plaintiff,” etc. S Street, Foundations of Legal Liability, c.

The Action of Special Assumpsit will never lie at Common Law on a Specialty. In such cases the proper rem edy is Debt or Covenant, and not Assumpsit.’ Where a Bond or other higher security is taken in the place of a Simple Contract, the mere acceptance of the higher security ipso facto merges and extinguishes the lower — that is, the Simple Contract — without re gard to the intention of the parties, and Special Assumpsit will not lie. The action must, therefore, be Covenant or Debt on the higher security. 8 In order that a merger may thus result, however, the subject - matter of the two securities must be identical, and the parties must be the same; and the higher 1 - Special Assujupsit Is not sustainable upon a Spe cialty.

Special Assumpsit, which lies for the breach of an Unsealed Contract, and Covenant, which lies for the Breach of a Sealed Contract, are Mutually Exclusive Remedies. Debt, which lies on a Simple (Ex ecuted) Contract is not to be confused with Special Assunipsit which lies for the Breach of an Express Promise, or of a Simple Contract in the Modern Sense. And Special Assumpsit is distinguishable from Trespass on the Case in that the former lies for the Breach of a Promise, whereas the latter lies for Tortious Misconduct resulting in an injury, hut they are sometimes concurrent rem edies. In General SPECIAL Assumpsit, having been differ entiated from its immediate ancestor, Case for Misfeasance and Case for Nonfeasance, and having in consequence achieved status as an Action Ex Contractu, became the rec - ognized Form of Action to recover Damages for the Breach of a Modern Simple Contract. As such, it is clearly distinguished from Coy S. English: Holmes v. Bell, 8 Man. & G. 213, 133 Bug. Rep. 1120 (1841); Hooper’s Case, 2 Leon. 110, 74 Eng.Rep. 399 (1587); Massachusetts: Banorgee v.

The action is distinguished from Debt, which lies for the recovery of a Specific Sum of money conceived of as belonging to the plaintiff, whereas Special Assump sit lies to recover Damages for Breach of a Promise. While the actions are sometimes concurrent, each proceeds upon its own pecu liar theory. Assumpsit is grounded upon a right of the plaintiff to be indemnified for some detriment incurred as a result of the defendant’s wrongful Breach, whereas Debt is based upon a right of the plaintiff to re - cover a sum certain to which he is entitled as a result of some quid pro quo supplied by him to the defendant. Special Assumpsit a s a Concurrent Remedy with Trespass on the Case for Tort ious Misconduct AND, of course, Special Assumpsit, while differing from its Tort Ancestor, Trespass on the Case, in that it lies for the breach of a duty imposed by the voluntary act of the parties in executing a contract, whereas in Case, the action is to compensate for a wrong independent of any contract obligation, none theless sometimes may be concurrent with Case, as, for example, where one purchases a railway ticket from one point to another an d then suffers an injury; he may, if he so de sires sue in Special Assumpsit for breach o~ the contract, or he may elect” to waive right under the contract and sue in Trespass on the Case for the violation of a duty caus 11.

Consideration in General EXCEPT in cases of Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes, and certain other Con tracts that import a Considerati on,~ it is al ways necessary for the Declaration express ly to state the Consideration for the Prom ise, for, if no Consideration is alleged, the Promise will appear, from all that the Dec laration shows, to be nudum pactuni, and therefore void.~~ And it i s equally essential that the Consideration alleged shall appear to be legally sufficient to support the prom ise.S1 It may sometimes happen, however, that, even where there is a sufficient Con sideration, the Declaration, by omitting some averment in stati ng it, may make it 12. In these eases the Declaration must show on its face that the Contract is of such a natui’e as to im port a Consideration. Nothing of this character can be left to be implied.

The Court held that readiness to receive was not a sufllcient performance of his obligation by the plaintiff; that payment of the price was intended to be concurrent with delivery of the corn.

The Breach, in Special Assumpsit, Is the violation of his Contract by the defendant. Being an essential ground of the action, the Declaration must state it expressly and with certainty, but less particularity is requisite when the facts constituting it lie more prop erly within the knowledge of the defendant. AS the Breach of a Contract is obviously an essential part of the cause of action, it cannot be omitted from the Declaration. 67 The manner of its Allegation must necessari ly be governed by the nature of the Promise or stipulation broken . 65 It should be As signed in the words of the Contract, either negatively or affirmatively, or in words which are co - extensive with its import and effect.° 9 Though the express words of the CS.

Jones, 13 Ark. 09, 56 Am. hoc, 206 (1852), The words of the Contract need not n ecessarily be used; but it is necessary that the words employed shall show clearly that the Contract has been bro Icon.

If the B reach assigned varies from the sense and Substance of the Contract, and is either more inn ited or larger than the Promise, it will be insntTh dent. Thus, in the case of a Promise to repair a fence, except on the west side thereof, a Broach thnt the defend ant did not repair the fence, without showing that the want of repair ~vaS ia other parts of the fence than on the west, is bad on Demurrer, though it may be Aided by Verdict.

Thus, where the Breach assigned was that the defendant had not used a farm in a husband1i1~e manner, ‘~p~ on the contrary had committed waste,” it was l ]eld that the plaintiff could not give evidence of the tie - feudnnts using the farm in an unln,sbandlihe manner, if such misconduct did not amount to waste, though on the former words of the as - signinent such evidence would have been admis sible. 1 Chitty, On Pleading, c.

The safest course is to state the Breach flrst in the words of the Contract, and then to superadd that the defendant , disregarding, did so and so, showing any Particular Breaches not narrowing or preju dicing the previous general assigliment, so that the plaintiff retains the advantage of both; and no in convenience can result from laying the Breach as extonsively as th e Contract, for the plaintiff may recover nithough he only prove a part of the Breach as laid.

THE Status of Special Assumpsit under Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court, clearly appears from a series of cases to which reference will now be made. Long before the Code of 1848, in the pivot al New York ease of Thoi - ne c~ Thorne v. Deas, 8 ° decided in 1809, which involved an Action of Trespass on the Case Super Se As sumpsit for a Nonfeasance in not causing in surance to be taken on a certain vessel, Chief Justice Kent, after reviewing the eal’)y Com mon Law learning on the development of Spe cial Assumpsit out of Trespass on the Case, from Watton v. Brinth, 8 ’ decided in 1400, to the Anonymous Caae in 1505,52 held that the promise to take out insurance was not good, without showing a Consideration. In Candler c~ Hart v. Rossiter, 83 decided in 1 833, the plaintiff declared in Assumpait for Money Paid, omitting the ordinary Super Be Assumpsit — that the defendant undertook and promised — and instead thereof stated the circumstances of his case, to wit, that he bought a quantity of fish for the purpose of shipping it to a foreign port; that defendant, as a joint adventure placed a similar quan tity of fish on board the same vessel, the parties to share the profit arid loss; that the fish were so damaged at sea, that they were sold at a loss, the whole of which the plaintiff sustained and paid, without having received any part thereof from the defendant, where by the plaintiff was damaged in the sum of $500. On Writ of Error, after a Trial and Verdict for the plaintiff, it was held that the Declaration was bad in not alleging a prom ise by the defendant and hi not setting forth a consideration. In reversing the Judgment below, Sutherland, J., declared: “It is probable that at this day the defect in those Declarations would be considered a 80. 4 Johns. (N. Y.) 84 (1800). SL Y.B. 2 Hen.

Mr. Lawes, whose treatise on pleading in the Action of As surnpsit is of the highest authority, seems to consider the omission of the Allegati on as fatal, after Verdict. This doctrine, upon the authority of the preceding cases, was also admitted by the Supreme Court of Massa chusetts, in 3 Mass.R. 160; opinion of Sedg wick, J., page 176. Judge Gould, in his val uable treatise on pleading, speaking on the"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"Page 352 of 735 subject of direct and positive averments, says, the rule appears to be, that all those facts which are directly denied by the terms of the general issue, or which may, by the established usage of pleading, be specially traversed, must be averred in direct and pos itive terms. Thus, in Assumpsit the Promise must be stated in terms direct and positive, because the general issue, Non ..4ssumpsit, purports to be a direct denial of the Promise. Gould’s Treatise on Plead. 73, § 42, 44, 75. Considering therefore, that no contract or agreement whatever is distinctly stated, nor any promise by the defendant, nor any con sideration for a promise, I think the Judg merit must be arrested. These defects are not cured by the Statute of Jeofails; it is the case of a defective title, and not of a good title defeCtively set out”~ After the adoption of the Code of 1848, in the case of Bootft v. The Farmers c~ Mechan ics’ National Bank of Rochester, 85 the plain tiff filed a Decla ration in Assumpsit contain ing two Counts. The first Count set forth that the defendant had assigned to the plain tiff a Judgment, that thereafter the defend ant discharged the Judgment; that the de fendants in the Judgment owned personal property, which, but for the discharge of the 84. 10 Wend.

Judgment would have been liable to execu tion and sale; and the defendants in the Judgment are now insolvent; and the plain tiff has been injured by the discharge. The second Count alleged that defendant was in. debted to the plaintiff for Money Had and Received. The defendant demurred on the ground of a Misjoinder of Actions, viz, one for a Tort, and one on Contract. On an Ap peal from an Order overruling the Demurrer, the Order was reversed. The first Count omitted the Allegation that the defendant undertook and promised to do the act complained of — that is. the Implied Promise by the defendant not to satisfy the Judgment. Wit hout such an Allegation the Count was in Case. And as the second Count was in Contract, there was a violation of the then rule of pleading that Tort and Contract Actions could not be joined. In reversing the Order of the Lower Court, the Court de dared; “ The Codifiers, while proposing to abolish the distinction between Forms of Actions, found it impossible or impracticable, in many cases, to effect their object, and this case illustrates the failure in at least one class of cases. When Case and Assumpsit w ere, at Common Law, Concurrent Reme dies, the Form of Action that the pleader selected was determined, as I have shown, by the insertion or omission from the Dec laration of the Allegation, that the defend ant “undertook and promised.” This right of select ion remains, and Whether the action is in Tort or Assumpsit must be determined by the same criterion. If this is not so, then the right of election is taken away. If tak en away, which of the two is left? An Ac tion on Contract cannot be joined with one in Tort. How are we to determine whether the action is One on Contract or in Tort, unless the pleader, by averment, alleges the making of the Contract, and demands dam ages £ or a Breach in the one case, or by the omission of such an averment makes it an 886 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS cit. 16 Action in Tort? I know of no more certain or convenient criterion by which to deter mine the class to which a Cause of Action belongs than the one suggested. If some such rule is not established the question of misjoinder will arise in every case hi which, at Common Law, Assumpsit and Case were Concurrent Remedies.” ~ In the case of Glanzer v. Shepard, decided in 1922,87 public weighers were requested by the seller to weigh goods sold , and were paid for their services by the seller, and the property was accepted and paid for by the plaintiffs, the buyers, on the faith of the weigher’s certificate. Upon discovering that the actual weight was short by 11,854 pounds, the plaintiffs brough t suit for $1,261. - 26, the amount over paid.

Bishop Stoddard Cafeteria Co., The. 89 decided under the Illinois Practice Act, a former employee of a corporation, which had agreed to buy his stock in the corporation upon the termi nation of his employment, upon refusal of the corporation to buy the stock, filed a suit to recover damages equal to the differ ence between the amount which the corpora tion had agreed to pay and the amount rea lized from sale thereof on the open market. The Declaration consisted of the Common Counts, to which the defendant pleaded the General Issue and two Special Pleas, one of which stated that the alleged promises were not evidenced by any writing, and hence were within the Statute of Frauds, while the other stated that the alleged promises were with out consideration. At the conclusion of plaintiff’s evidence, and at the close of all the evidence, the defendant moved f or a Direct ed Verdict. The Motion having been de&ed, a Verdict was rendered finding the defendant liable and assessing the plaintiff’s damages at $758.00. The defendant moved for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, in Arrest of Judgment and for a New Tr ial, which Mo tions were denied, although with a Remitti ter of $350, after which Judgment was ren dered in favor of Plaintiff, On Appeal, the Judgment was reversed and remanded, the Court stating that the Common Counts can not be resorted to where there i s a Special Contract and the Breach thereof is the gray - amen of the action, but in such case the plaintiff must declare specially. From the foregoing discussion, it appears that the Action of Special Assumpsit, despite the efforts at reform, is still aliv e and vigor ous, not only in the Non - Code States, but also in States operating under Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court. 89. 288 Ifl.App. 174 (1937).

Although no Express Promise to pay was made, the Law recogn izes that by his conduct he Impliedly Promised to Pay, and to enforce this Implied in Fact Promise, Assumpsit is the proper remedy. 2 The term “Implied Contract,” as used in a - second sense, is applied to promises Im plied or Created by Operation of Law, without any agreement between the par ties, and oftentimes, even when the circum stances actually negative the existence of any agreement whatsoever, as where one pays money which another person ought to have paid, or receives money which another ought to have received, or, in some cases, where benefits are conferred upon another without any agreement. The Promise thus said to be Implied in Law is a sheer fiction of Law, resorted to for the purpose of allow ing a remedy in Assumpsit. Such Obliga tions are n ot Contractual, but Quasi - Con tractual, 3 EXPRESS CONTRACTS WHICH DO NOT EXCLUDE INDEIIITATUS ASSUMPSET 173, Indebitaths or General Assumpsit will not lie where there has been an Express Con tract, except that it may be permitted in in stances such as the following: (I) Where the facts underlying the Ex press Contract are equivalent to the legal duty created by the Con - tract. (II) ‘Where the Contract, or some divisi ble part thereof, has been Fully Executed by the plaintiff, and noth in g remains but the payment of money by the defendant. 2.

(V) Where the Contract is merely void (not illegal), or merely unenforce able, or voidable and has been avoided, there may be a recovery in General Assumpsit for Part Per formance. - (VI) Where Additional Work has been done on request in performing a Special Contract. THE general rule of law is that if there is an Executory Special Contract, Indebitatus .Assumpsit will not lie; for the Jaw will not Imply a Promise to pay, except where the Consideration is Executed on th e plaintiff’s part and a duty arises to pay the value of what he has done. 4 The leading English case of Cutter v.

I’Torthern Assurance Co., 6 in which the Court alluded to the Common Law rule as follows: “In the present ease the facts aside from the Promise, viz: the plaintiff’s ownership of the property, its destruction by fire without his fault, — even the pay ment of premiums, — do not raise an Implied Promise by the defendant to pay; it is only the fact that i t Promised, upon certain con ditions, to pay, that makes it liable. Con - sequently, at Common Law, the Promise, the Conditions, and the Fulfillment of the Conditions, must be set forth — in other words the Count must be Special.” I But an Express Contract, u nder which a transaction has been Partially or Wholly Ex - ecuted, does not always exclude an Action of Indebitatus or General Assumpsit for money due on such transaction. The factual situa tion involved may give rise to an Implied Contract, in which case re covery may be had on a Common Count. The occasions when this may occur may be grouped under the following heads: 6. 75 Vt. 441, 56 A. 05 (1903). 7. Hersey v. Northern Assurance Co., 75 Vt. 4 - 41, 443. 56 A. 03 (1903). S. Gibbs v.

(I) Where the Facts Underlying the Ex press Contract are Equivalent to the Legal Duty Created by the Contract. — Where the Express Contract in question creates no oth er obligation than that which the Law would normally imply from the existing factual situation, a Common Count in Indebitatus Assumpsit will lie; Thus, in Gibbs v.

It was held in Illinois that a recovery of tIme balance due on a building Contract cannot be had under Common Counts, where the contractor relies on Mat ter of Excuse for not procuring the final certificate of approval by the architect; but in case of Sub stantIal Performance, where no certificate is called for, recovery may he had under the Common C ounts for labor and material in spite of slight variations. Why the plaintiff cannot show excuse for non - pro duction of an architect’s certificate under the Corn - men Counts to show a recoverable indebtedness for value received Is not entirely clear.

Indebitatus Assumpsit is in general a substitute for Debt on Simple (Executed) Con tract; it was not, however, as broad as Debt, as it was not availabl e on a Specialty, a Record or a Statute, in general, It was distinguished from Special Assuiupsit which lay for Breach of an Express Contract, whereas Indebitatus Assumpsit lay for the recovery of a debt or an obligation akin to a debt. The Action was Conc urrent with Debt, Special Assumpsit and Trover, under certain circumstances, and sub ject to certain necessary qualifications. IT is essential that the distinctions between Indebitatus Assumpsit and other actions should be clearly understood. It is frequent ly said that Indebitatus Assumpsit is a sub stitute for Debt on Simple (Executed) Con tract. For all practical purposes this is true, but in order to be technically correc t, the statement requires some qualification, as strictly speaking, Indebitatus Assumpsit dif fered from Debt in that it might be main tained in situations where the sum alleged to be due was not susceptible of precise proof, 2 ° as required in Debt; it coul d be used to re cover installments of a debt which in its en tirety was not yet due; 21 and it lay against Texas: Steven’s Ex’rs v.

I an Executor or Administrator, against whom Debt would not lie under the Early Common Law where the testator had the right to de mand Trial by Wager of Law. 22 However, until Debt was extended to cover obligations which were not certain, but which might be reduced to certainty by averment or proof, Debt was not a remedy for Obligations sim ilar to but not identical with a True Common - Law Debt, and IIOW known as Quasi - Con tractual Obligations. And while Indebitatus Assumpsit would usually lie where Debt would lie, the converse was not true. As Dean Ames has pointed out, there were many cases where Assumpsit was the only remedy, as the benefit received did not constitute a R eal Debt or a Real Contract. 23 In a certain sense, however, Debt was broader than Indebitatus Assumpsit, as the latter action would not lie on a Specialty, a Record, or a Statute, generally; Indebitatus Assumpsit was a substitute for Debt original ly only in the Field of Debt on Simple (Exe Cuted) Contract; and in the sense that orig inally Debt was not available on Quasi - Con tractual Obligations, whereas Indebitatus As sumpsit would lie, the latter action might be said to be broader than the former. Spec ial Assumpsit was an action to recover Damages for the Breach of an Express Con tract, whereas Indebitatus Assumpsit was an action to recover a Common - Law debt, and finally, to recover obligations akin to debts, but not quite identical therewith. But as w e have seen, Indebitatus Assump sit and Debt were concurrent in the field of Debt on Simple (Executed) Contract, and Indebitatus Assumpsit may and frequently is concurrent with Special Assumpsit, where, over and above the Simple, Executed Con tract, which supports the former action, 22. On the present validity of this distinction, see Ohildress v. Emory, 8 Wheat. (U.S.) 642, 5 L.Ed. 705 (1823). CIt. 17 there is also an Express Promise, which has been Breached. And in such a case it may be eminently judicious to so frame the Decla ration in Assumpsit as to permit the plaintiff to avail himself of either basis of liability. This result may be attained by declaring in a Special Count upon the Actual or Express Contract and thereafter adding one or more Common Counts, covering the meritorious services the rendition of which may be proved. Moreover, under certain circumstances, In debitatus Assumpsit is a concurrent r emedy with Trover. Thus, where a defendant has taken and converted the chattels of the plain tiff amid sold them, at his Election, the plain tiff may sue in Trover for the Conversion, or he may Waive the Tort, and sue in Indebita tus Assumpsit on a Count f or Money Had and Received.

And, in setting forth his Declaration, the pleader need not indicate which variety of Implied Contract — in fact or in law — he re lies upon . But as the Executed Considera tion is an indebtedness, and the Promise alleged to have been broken is one legally resulting from the fact of such indebtedness, the Proof at the Trial must show a debt. It follows, therefore, that the action in reality is one for the recovery o a Money Debt, due upon a Simple (Executed) Contract, such, for example, as upon the sale of goods, or lands, 28 for rendition of services, for work, labor and materials, or on an Account Stated, as well as other similar transactions r esulting in the enrichment of the defendant at the plaintiff’s expense. If a person requests another to do work for him under such circumstances that the other has a right to expect pay therefor, and the latter does the work, the Law will, as an Inference of Fact, Imply a Promise by the former to pay what the services were reason ably worth, and the action to recover such compensation is General Assumpsit. So, if a man orders goods from another without an Express Promise to Pay a certain price, and they are delivered, the seller may maintain Ceneral Assumpsit to recover their value. So, if a person pays money which another should have paid, he may maintain General Assumpsit against the latter to recover it, such a Count being known as a Count for Money Paid by the plaintiff for the use of the defendant. And where a man receives money which in equity and good conscience belongs to another, the latter may sue in General Assumpsit to recover, this Count being k nown as the Count for Money Re 2$.

(I) The Indebitatus Counta — In an In debitatus Count in Assumpsit, the most com prehensive of all, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant, on a certain day, at a certain place, was indebted to him in a certain sum, for a certain described Cause or Considera tion furnished by the plaintiff, and stating the Consideration ~ to have bee n furnished at the special instance and request of the defendant. 32 In general, time and place are immateriaL - 33 If the suit is in a Court of In 30. OrLuim of the Common Counts: “In declaring in Debt, except possibly upon an Account Stated, the plathti~ was required to set forth his cause of ac tion with great particularity - . Thus, the Count in Debt must state the quantity and description of goods sold, with the details of the price, all the par ticulars of a loan, the names of the pe,’sons to whom the mo ney was paid with the amounts of each payment, the namcs of the persons from whom money was received to the use of the plaintiff with the amounts of each receipt, the precise nature and amount of services rendered. Ta Indebitatus As sumpait, on the other b and, the debt being laid as an Inducement or Conveyance to the Assumpsit, it was not necessary to set forth all the details of the transaction from which it arose. It was enough to allege the general nature of the indebtedness, as for goods sold, money len t! money paid at the defendant’s request, money bad and received to the pIaft~tiff’s use, work and labor at the defendant’s re quest, or upon an Account Stated, and that the de fendnnt being so indebted Promised to Pay.

(A) The Money Counts — The Money Counts relate only to Money Transactions as the basis of the debt, while the other Counts relate to any transaction other than a Money Transaction upon which a debt may be founded. These Counts, in the order list ed in the chart above, will now be separately considered. ~4. This requirement is in addition to the of the County as Venue Massachusetts: President, etc., of Nantucket Bank, 5 (1S09)~ New York: Wetmore v. Baker, 9 ‘L) 307 (1812); Virginia: Thoraton v. Wash.

Sec. 176 ACTION OF INDEBITATUS ASSUMPSIT 351 (1) The Count for Money Paid to the De fendant’s Use. — The theory underlying this Count is that where one person allows or requests another to assume such a position that the latter may be and is compelle d to discharge a legal liability of the former, the Law creates or implies a request of the for mer to the latter to make the payment, and a Promise to repay him thus Implied, and the liability thus created may be enforced by an action of Indebitatus Assum psit. As indicated by the heading such an action is technically called an action for money paid by the plaintiff for the use of the defendant; and in order to maintain a Count for Money thus Paid, it was necessary for the plaintiff to show, first, a paymen t in money, and see ondly, such payment must have been paid at the defendant’s request. And money must actually have been paid; a security such as a bond, or even stock, is not sufficient,~ This Count will lie where a party has been com pelled to pay a deb t that another should have paid. Thus, where a member of a firm gave a Promissory Note, signed in the partnership name for a debt of his own, and his partner was compelled to pay it, it was held that the latter might recover from the former as for Money Pa id to his use. 3 ° And the same rule applied where one of several sureties, or other joint debtors, pays the whole debt. In such case he is allowed to recover from each of the others his proportionate share; and a Request to Pay and a Promise to Pay are feig ned, in order to entitle him to the remedy by an Action of Indebitatus Assumpsit. 4 ° The 38.

Wheel er, 118 Mass. 295 (1875); New York: Doremus v. s ame is also true where a surety pays the debt of his principal. 4 ’ Where the money was illegally paid the Count will not lie. 42 (2) The Count for Money Had and Re ceived. 43 — The theory of this Count is that whenever one person has received money to which an other person, in justice and good conscience, is entitled, the Law creates or Implies a Promise by the former to pay it to the latter, and an Action of Assutnpsit will lie to enforce this liability on the basis of the Fictitious Promise.~~ The action is te ch Selden, 19 Johns. (N.Y.) 213 (1821); Pennsylvania: Steekel v. Stcekel, 28 Pa. 233 (1857). Where several persons agree to contribute equally to certain expenditures, and one advances more than his share, the excess is so much paid for the use of the oth ers and hence may be recovered in Indebita tus Assumpsit.

(B) Other Counts: (1) The Count for Use and Occupation of LandP — At Common Law the Action of Indebitatus Assumpsit was not available for Use and Occupation upon a quasi - contra ct.~ The reason for this as worked out by Dean James Barr Ames, was connected with the nature of rent. On a lease for years, reserving a rent, as well as on a sale of goods, originally Debt was the only remedy. In both cases the Obligation to Pay did not a rise out of a Contract in the modern sense, as Debt for goods sold was based on the 43 - ~n general, on the Development of Indebitatus As sumpsit as a remedy to recover damages for Use and Occupation, see: TreatIses: 3 Street Foundations of Legal Liabili ty, c.

As to the sale of goods, the situation was altered by the development of Assumpsit, under which Assumpsit was extended into the Field of Debt, first, by holdi ng that Assumpsit would lie where a Promise to Pay a Debt was made subsequent to the time when the Debt was created, and second, by the holding in 1602 in Blade’s Case,° 6 in which it was decided “that the buy er’s words of agreement, which had before opera ted only as a grant, imported also a Promise, so that the seller might, without more, sue in Debt or Assumpsit, at his op tion.’’ 67 But the courts refused to take this step in the case of rent, and apparently there was only one case °~ of Indebitatus Assumpsit for rent prior to legislative intervention. In that case, Black v. Bowsat,°° decided in 1623, the reporter observed: “Note, there was not any exception taken, that the assumpsit is to pay a sum for rent; which is a real and special duty, as strong as upon a Specialty; and in such case this action lies not, without some Special Cause of Promise.” ~° And Dean Ames cites cases to support the view that thereafter the plaintiff failed to recover in Assumpsit, both where there was a subse quent Express Promise to Pay, as well as where there was no such Promise. 11 Assumpsit was made concurrent with Debt in order to evade Trial by Wager of Law, but 65.

Eowsnl, Cro.~ac. 668, 79 Eng.Rep. 57s, 570 (1023), this incentive was lacking in the case of rent, as Wager of Law was not available in Debt for Rent. And the Execu tor of a Lessee was chargeable in Debt, while only Assumpsit was permitted against the Executor of a Buyer or Borrower. Hence, as Dean Ames suggests, the Courts found no reason why they should extend Indebitatus Assumpsit in to the Field of Rent. In time, however, the landlord was permitted in certain cases to sue in Special Assumpsit as well as Debt, an innovation brought about by the continu ing struggle between the Royal Courts for Jurisdiction. As Special Assumpsit was a branch of Trespass on the Case, over which King’s Bench had jurisdiction, this part of its jurisdiction was expanded to cover the situa tion, as it had no jurisdiction over cases aris ing by Original Writ in Debt. In its earliest attempt, as in the case of Synwock v. Payn, 72 the Court so ught to justify its usurpation by construing agreements concerning leases as not creating a rent. In 1635, in the case of Acton v. Bimonds,’7 3 it was held that As sumpsit would lie concurrently with Debt where it appeared that at the time of the lease, the lessee had expressly Promised to Pay the rent. The argument was sum mari2ed in a report of the same case in Rolle’s Abridgment, 5 ’ where it was said: “ The action lay, because it appeared that it was intended by the parties that a lease should be made and a rent reserved, and for better security of payment thereof that the lessor should have his remedy by Action of Debt upon the reservation, or Action upo n this Collateral Promise at his Election, and this being the intent at the beginning, the making of the lease though real would not toll this Collateral Promise, as a man may covenant to accept a lease at a certain rent and to pay the rent according to th e reserva~ tion, for they are two things, and so the 75.

XV, Assump sit for Use and O ccupation, 167 (Cambridge 1913). 356 OFFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 17 Promise of Payment is a thing Collateral to the Reservation, which will continue though the lessee assign over.” According to Dean Ames, this doctrine, as recognized by the Court of King’ s Bench, was adopted by the Court of Exchequer in the case of Trever v. Roberts, 75 decided in 1664, and by the Court of Common Bench in the case of Johnson v. May, 5 ° decided in 1683. In the cases consid ered to this point the assumpsit was for the payment of a sum certain, but anumpsit was also admissible in cases where the amount to be recovered was uncertain, that is, where the defendant promised to pay a reasonable compensation for use and occupation of land. And, as Debt originally would not lie upon a Quantum Meruit Count, 71 Assumpsit thus filled a gap in the remedial law, as it lay where the sum to be recovered was indefinite or uncertain,~ with the consequence that Debt would not lie. Against this background, in the year 1737, the Statute of 11 Ceo. If, c. 19, was enacted. To remedy the inconvenience of suing for the recovery of rents, where the demises were not by deed, Section 14 provided that it shall be lawful for a landlord, “where the agreement is not by deed, to recover a reasonable satis facti on for the lands, tenements, and heredit aments held or occupied by the defendant in an Action on the Case for the Use and Occu pation of what was so held or enjoyed; and if, in evidence on the Trial of such action, any parol or demise or agreement, not be ing by deed, whereon a certain rent was reserved, shall appear, the plaintiff shall not there fore be Non - suited, but may make use there of as an evidence of the Quantum of Dam ages to be recovered.” From the language of the Statute, it is ev ident that it was ~6.

King t Stephens, 2 RelIc 435, ~1 EngRep. 900 (1823). designed to eliminate two earlier dif ficulties which barred the use of Indebitatus Assump sit for Use and Occupation; first, to prevent a plaintiff from being Non - Suited on the ground of a Variance, where the plaintiff had sued upon a Quantum Meruit Count, and it appeared from the evidence th at the demise was for a sum certain, for which Debt was the proper remedy; and second, to escape from the necessity of proving an Express Promise at the time of the demise, where the plaintiff declared for a sum certain, and it was the removal of this seco nd diffi culty which gave the Statute its chief sig nificance. Dean Ames summed up the mat ter, when he declared: “Thereby Indebitatus Ass’umpsit became concurrent with Debt up on all Parol Demises. In other words, the Statute gave to the landlord, in 1738 , what Blade’s Case gave to the seller of goods, the lender of money, or the employee, in 1602; namely, the right to sue in Assumpsit as well as in Debt, without proof of an Independent Express Promise.” ‘~° Although the Statute only mentioned an Action o n the Case, which meant Assump sit, Debt for Use and Occupation still re mained available, 60 even where there was an Express Demise, but not by deed. 8 ’ Thus, the action of Indebitatus Assumpsit for Use and Occupation became a remedy in all those cases in w hich the demise or agreement was not by deed, and where the defendant had had an actual or constructive occupation; but where the demise or agreement was by deed, the action would not lie, in which case the remedy was in Debt or Covenant on the demise or a greement. 65 79.

But when Debt was extended to suchjmplied Ob ligations, under the maxim Id certum efl quocl certum reddi potest [that is certain which can be made certain], and the Indebitatus Count in Assumpsit came to be perniitted in cases where by evidence an uncertain sum could be reduced to a certainty, it thus was made possible to mai ntain the action on such factual situations as formerly required the use of the Quantum Meruit or Quantum Vale bant Counts. The Value Counts of Quantum Meruit and Quantum Valebant, in the eyes of the legal profession in England, came to be regarded as unne cessary, their original scope and purpose being brought within the purview of the Indebitatus Count in Assurnpsit and in Debt.

A Co unt in Quantum Mcmii, as well as one in Intl ebitat us Assumpsit for Work, Labor, Skill, Care, Dili gence, etc., claims a certain sum due. In either case the plaintiff may recover less, and the Judgment is for so much of his stated claim as is found to be justly merited. The Counts in Quantum Meruit and Quantum Valebat, are therefore unnecessary in any case.” ~ The effect of such decisions has been to reduce the necessary Common Counts to the indebitatus Counts and the Account Stated, the latter of which w ill now be considered.

The Promise of the Defendant, though it is an Implied One, must always be al leged. IT is not intended by this that there must be a detailed statement of the defendant’s Contract, but a brief Allegation that the de fendant “Promised” or “Agreed” to pay the sum owed or value claimed. This much is held essential to a proper statement of the Cause of Action, as the Declaration might otherwise show the rWeged Consideration to be merely a voluntary or gratuitous act on the part of the plaintiff, for w hich there could be no recovery. 30 It does not make any dif ference whether the defendant ever made any such Promise, nor is it necessary to prove it. All that is necessary to prove is a debt, and the law Implies a Promise. Eut some Courts will reverse a case on this technical matter. 5 ’ DECLARATION IN INDEBITATUS AS SUMPSIT — ESSENTIAL ALLEGA TIONS: (4) THE BREACH 181.

As in Special Assumpsit, it is an essential part of the cause of action, and must in all cases be stated, THE neglect or refusal of the defendant to fulfill his Promise, whether Express or Im plied, is always a necessary Allegation in the Declaration, as it is essential to the plaintiff’s right to sue, In form it is usually a brief statement that the defendant has neglected and refused to pay, and still neglects and re fuses so to do.

The Declaration must allege the Dam ages directly resulting from the Breach by the defendant, and must lay them high enough to cover the actual demand. THE measure of recovery in this action will obviously be the amount of the inde bted ness due, or the reasonable worth and value of the services rendered or goods or land sold, where no sum was agreed upon; and the Damages must always be laid high enough to cover all the plaintiff expects to prove, as his recovery will be limited to t he amount stated. 33 STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES OF COURT 183.

THE Action of Indebitatus (General) As sumpsit was in general use in the several states of the United States prior to 1848?~ After 1848, the action remained in vogue. Thus, for example, in the Rhode Jsland case of Parker v. Macomber)° 5 decided in 1892, in which the plaintiff brought Indebitatus As sumpsit for Goods Sold and Delivered, Work and Labor, Money Had and Received, and for Interest, and the Jury returned a Ver dict for the plaintiff and assessed Damages at $1,072.50, being at a certain rate for 390 weeks, and the defendant prayed for a New Trial, contending, among other things, that the services were performed under an Entire Contract, which had not been completed, the Court denied a New Trial. In so doing, Doug las, J. declared: “The questions which are raised by the petition are, whether the plaintiff can re cover what his services are reasonably worth, notwithstanding the making of the Contract, and, if so, whether this Declara tion is sufficient without a Count in Quan tum Me ruit to admit evidence of the value of the services, and to sustain a Judgment"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Page 385 of 735 therefor. “We cannot doubt that, when this ac tion was brought, the agreement had been annulled, if it ever had had any validity. “ If the leasehold interest were for a term exceeding one year, the agreement amounted to an attempt to convey an interest in real estate by parol, and was void under the Stat ute of Frauds. 34.

Lockwood v. Barnes, 3 Hill, N.Y. 128; King v. Welcome, 5 Gray. 41.” ~ In New York case of City of New York v. Fink, 31 decided in 1927, the issue was raised as to whether, under the Code, an action would lie against a trespasser to land for the reas onable value of the Use and Occupation thereof? In denying a Motion by the defend ant, under Rule 112 of the Rules of Civil Prac tice, for Judgment on the Pleadings, McGold rick, J. said: “As a Development of the Common Law a party was permitted to bring a n Action of Assumpsit and thus avoid the difficulties presented in the Pleading and Proof of Caus es of Action in Covenant, Debt and the like. The remedy, however, was not extended to a case in which the landlord sought to recov er compensation for the use of his land, not reserved by deed, until the enactment of statutes (see 11 George II, chap. 19, § 14), in substance re - enacted in our Revised Stat utes and contained in Section 220 of our Real Property Law. When it is said, there fore, that to maintain Us e and Occupation the conventional relation must exist, and such action cannot be maintained against a trespasser (Prof. Ames “Assumpsit for Use and Occupation,” 2 Harv.L.R. 377; Keener Quasi Contracts, 191, 192), this merely means that the Form of Action c haracterized as As sumpsit and based upon the existence of the conventional relation of landlord and tenant could not be maintained against one not bound expressly or impliedly as tenant, or against a trespasser. “It would seem to follow that the histori c al reasons which prevented an owner of property from recovering Damages for tres Sc.

Dean Pomeroy held to the position that in the face of the Code requirement that the Complaint should state the facts in plain and concise language, the practice of using the Common Counts in In debitatus Assumpsit violated one of the fun damental objectives of the Codes.~ “Bu t” said Judge Clark, “the Common Counts were apparently too well and favorably known and too convenient a form of pleading to suc cumb to this strenuous attack, for in prob ably all Jurisdictions the use of the Common Counts, at least for an indebtedness i ncurred with the defendant’s consent, is well set tled.” 40 Judge Clark’s view finds confirmation in the New York case of Maxherntan Co.

Such be ing the case, I cannot distinguish the Com plaint in the case at Bar, supported as it is by the Bill of Particulars, from the Com plaints in numerous other adjudicated cases.” 42 Finally, in the Federa l case of Stone v.

Alper, 210 App.Div. 380, 392 (1024). 43. 301 U.S. 532, 57 S.Ct. 851, 81 LEd. 1265 (1937). of taxes erroneously collected, the Supreme Court of the United States sustained the plaintiff, Mr. Justice Stone observing: “The action, brought to recover a tax er roneously paid, although an action at law, is equitable in its function. It is the lineal successor of the Common Count in Indebita fits Assumpsit for Money Had and Received. Originally an action for the recovery of debt, favored because more convenient and flexible than the Common Law Action of Debt, it has been gradually expanded as a medium for recovery - upon every Form of Quasi - Contractual Obligation in which the duty to pay money is Imposed by Law, inde pendently of Contract, Express or Implied in Fact.” 41 It thus appears that the Common - Law Ac tion of Indebitatus (General) Assumpsit is s till operating with its earlier vitality sub stantially unimpaired, despite our Modern Codes, Practice Acts and Rules of Court. 44.

The Demand of Oyer is the Assertion of the Right of a Patty to hear read (Oyer), or, in Modern Practice, to inspect, a deed of which Profert is made by the Other Party in his Pleading. IF the Declaration contained Profert of an Instrument under Seal, up on which the plaintiff grounded his Right of Action, the first steps of the defendant, after its receipt, was a Demand of Oyer; that is, the Right to 1.

It was necessary to have the Instrument read in Open Court, where the defendant desired to ascertain t he au thenticity of the Instrument, or to make use by Demurrer or Plea of such portions of the Document as were not set forth in the Dee laration. The effect of granting Oyer was to make the Instrument under Seal a Part of the Record. And the Right of Oyer existed in all the Common - Law Actions, whether Mixed, Personal or Real, and by its exercise, 2. Rand v. Rand, 4 N.H. 267, 278 (1828); Judge of Probate v. Merrill, 6 N.H. 256 (1833). The right to crave Oyer of Papers mentioned in plead ing applies only t o Specialties and to Letters of Probate and Administration, not to other writings. It only applies to a deed when the party pleading relIes upon the direct and Intrinsic operation of the deed, Smith r.

It was also demandable in response to Profert made in any pleading subsequent to the Declaration? When a Deed is pleaded with Profert, it is supposed to remain in Court all the Term in which it is pleaded, but no longer, unless the opposite pa?ty during that Term plead in de nial of the Deed, in which case it is sup posed to remain in Court till the Action is determi ned. Hence, it is a Rule that Oyer cannot be demanded in a subsequent Term to that in which profert is made. 4 A party having a Right to Demand Oyer is yet not obliged, in all cases, to exercise that right; nor is he obliged in all cases, after demanding i t, to notice it in the plead ing he afterwards files or delivers. Some times, however, he is obliged to do both, namely, where he has occasion to found his answer upon any matter contained in the Deed of which Profert is made, and not set 3.

Oyer could only be demanded where Profcrt is made. Thus in an action on a bond conditioned for per formance of the covenant in another deed, the de fendant cannot crave Oyer of such deed, but must himself plead it with a Profert.

Acc ording to the settled Conunon - Law Rule of Prac tice in this State, the same not having been abro gated or altered by statute, Oyer of a bond de - clared on cannot be craved after the First Term succeeding the final proceeding at rules, or after the defendant has - pleaded, or a Rule to Plead has ex pired, as thereafter presumably the bond is not in Court.

In such cases the only admissible method of making such mat ter appear to the Court is to Demand Oyer, and from the copy given, set forth the whole deed verbatim in his pleading. 5 In Pleading Performance, fo r example, of the condition of a Bond, where, as is gener ally the case, the plaintiff in his Declaration has stated nothing but the Bond itself, with out the condition, it is essential for the de fendant to Demand Oyer of the condition and then set it for th. 6 And in pleading Per formance of Matters contained in a Collat - eral Instrument, it is necessary not only to do this, but it is also essential to set forth and make Profert of the whole substance of the Collateral Instrument; otherwise it would not appe ar that the Instrument did not stipulate for the Performance of nega tive or disjunctive matters; and, in that case, the General Plea of Performance of the Matters therein contained, as shown above, would be improper.

VIEWS, AID - PRAYER AND VOUCHER TO WARRANTY 185. Preliminary to making a Defense in the Ancient Real Actions, a defendant might seek a View of the Land to better formulate his Defense, an Aid - Prayer, or a call for as sistance in pleading, and a Voucher to War ranty, or a call to some other person to answer the action. Views, Aid - Prayer and Voucher to Warranty IN the Ancient Real Actions, now obso lete to all practical intents and purposes, there were certain motions available to the defendant as a preliminary to making his Defense. A mere enumeration and defini tion of these early procedural devices will suffic e. In Suits by a Demandant to recover land, the tenant, in certain of the Real Actions was permitted to Demand a View of the Land in dispute. The purposes of such Demand was that he might know with some certainty what specific land the plaintiff sought to re cover. Such knowledge enabled him to prop erly shape his Defense.° Where the tenant felt that his own estate was weak, he might, as was said Pray in Aid or call for the assistance of another to assist him in pleading. Such a motion might be made by th e life tenant, asking that the own er of the inheritance in reversion or in re naainder be joined with him, or that he should assist in defending the title.’° 9.

After the plaintiff had filed his IJecla ration, the defendant was entitled to time with in which he might confer with his Adversary, with a view to an amicable settlement. The delay thus permitted was called an Imparlance, and the word Impariance came to be applied to the time given to either party in responding to his adversary’s pleading. AFTER the defendant put in an Appe ar ance, he was entitled to the indulgence of the Court, to some delay, before responding to the Declaration. This privilege was known as an Imparlance, taken from the French “parler”, meaning to speak. Martin says that in the Primitive or Oral Period of P leading, it signified a Jeave to confer with the opposite party, with a view to an amica ble settlement of the controversy.’ 2 Jn order to accomplish this end time was required, and, as a result, the word itself came to rep resent the time given by the Cour t to either Party to respond to the pleading of his op ponent.’ 3 Imparlances were of Three Kinds: tutes of Common and Statute Law, 608 (Richmond, 1891 — 95). ~1.

Imparlance is a delay granted by the Court in response to a General Prayer for leave to imparl, without the saving of any exceptions. If leave was granted, the party obtaining it could plead only in Bar of the Action; he could plead neither in Abate ment, nor to the Jurisdiction of the Court. He was also precluded from pleading a Ten - der, claim of Conusance, or Demanding Oyer of a Deed. According to Martin, this Tm - parlance, whi ch was customarily granted, came to be entered by the attorneys as a mat ter of course, and operated as a Continuance of the Cause to the Next Term? 5 A Special Imparlance was granted in re sponse to a prayer for an Imparlance which reserved the right to make Dilatory Pleas in Abatement to the Writ, Bill, or Count, but not to the Jurisdiction of the Court, unless the Pleas were grounded on a personal priv ilege.’° Such an Imparlance was granted only by leave of the Court of King’s Ben ch, or by the Court or Prothonotaries in the Court of Common Pleas, and its effect was to extend the time for pleading to some day during the same Term or to the first four days of the next Term. 17 A General Special Imparlance was distin guished from the foregoing Imparlances, in that it secured to the applicant the right to make any exceptions to the Bill, Declaration or Writ.

The Procedural Device known as a Bill of Particulars enabled a defendant to ascertain the details of the plaintiff’s claim. The mere naming of t his Device raises two questions; one, as to its Origin, two, as to its Scope and Application. As to its Origin, it may be said that its de velopment was late in point of time. No satisfactory explanation of this has been given, but i t is surmised that the Origin of the Bill of Particulars is connected with the fact that the early Common Law employed a System of Oral Pleading, which, unlike Mod ern Pleading, was conducted in Open Court in advance of the Triai by the Parties or their Co unsel by word of mouth. Since the Pleading took place Orally in the presence of the Court, the Judge could direct each Stage of the Pleadings and compel the Parties to reach an Issue on which both parties were prepared to stand. Thus, to illustrate, let u s suppose that A, in stating his case, alleged that B took his horse, whereupon B inquired, what horse? Thereupon, the Judge required A to specify what horse, to wit, a black horse, with a white forefront foot. The plaintiff’s Allega tion having been made Specific, the defend ant B might object that A’s case was insuffi cient in Law, he might deny the plaintiff’s charge, or he might seek to avoid the alleged liability by admitting the taking of the horse, and then offer the excuse that he took the horse under an Execution. Assuming B ad mitted the taking and offered the excuse that he took the horse under an Execution, the Judge could turn to the plaintiff, A, and say, how about this? If A traversed B’s Plea, an Issue of Fact was raised as to whether B took the horse in Execution; if A Demurred to B’s Plea, an Issue of Law was raised as to whether the taking by Execution was a legal ly sufficient excuse. At each stage of this Oral Altercation, during the early Develop mental Period of Pl eading, the Court was Sec. 187 AFTER THE DECLARATION AND BEFORE THE PLEA"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"Page 392 of 735 0~70 ‘no available to rule at once as to the validity of the plaintiff’s Statement of his Cause of Ac tion or the defendant’s Statement of his De fence. Thus, if the plaintiff’s Alleg ation was too general, and the defendant objected, the Court could compel the plaintiff then and there to make his Declaration more specific, and so, likewise, the Court could compel the defendant to make his Defence more specific if the defendant was too general in setting forth his Defence. By permitting the Par ties to restate their positions to meet with the Court’s ideas, by a process of free Amendment, the Parties were directed in the development of an Issue of Fact or of Law which fairly presented th e ground upon which the Parties were prepared to conduct their part of the action. If the Pleadings terminated in an Issue of Law, the Trial was heard by the Court; if they ended in an Issue of Fact, the Trial was had according to some one of the establish ed ModS of Trial. Whether the Issue was one of Law or of Fact, the intervention of a Bill of Particulars was not necessary to bring the parties to Issue or to Judgment. But the whole picture changed when Liti gation in Person with the Pleader serving as h is own mouthpiece was changed to Liti gation by Attorney, who, according to the practice of the Court, was now required to commit his instructions to writing. So re duced to writing, the Prothonotary, an Offi cer of the Court, recorded them on a Parch ment Roll. 2 ’ It is not known when the plead ing was first required to be written, but Holdsworth suggests a ease which arose dur ing the Reign of Henry VI (1422 — 1461) as in volving “perhaps the first and certainly an early mention of a ‘paper’ pleading.” 22 The first departure probably took place when the Parties or their Counsel Entered the Pro - 21. 3 Ilo1ds~vortli, History of English Law, e. VI, Pro ced,,ro and Pleading, 043 — 644 (4th ed. London 1035). ceedings on the Roll, 23 but in time this gave way to th e later practice of putting the Pleadings in Writing at once. Whatever the reason for this transition, the change had a profound effect upon the Issue - Making Func lion of Pleading. According to Simpson, 24 “Technicality developed; ease of Amendment disappea red; most important of all, the Pleading Stage of a Common - Law cause ceased to be conducted in the presence of the Court and became a matter for the Parties and their Lawyers alone except where the Court’s decision on the issues as developed between unsupe rvised counsel was required.” Thus, reverting to our hypothetical case, suppose that A under the new regime, files a Written Declaration containing a General Allegation that B took his horse. B wants to know what horse? Since the parties are no longer pleading Orally before an Open Court, the question naturally arose as to how B could compel A to make his General Al legation more specific? It was this predica ment which the defe ndant found himself in, which gave rise to the demand for the devel opment of some form of procedural device by which he could compel the plaintiff to make a General Charge in his Declaration specific. And the procedural device developed to meet this situ ation came to be known as a Bill of Particulars. Apparently it made its first appearance in criminal prosecutions, such as an indictment for common barratry 25 and in legislative divorce cases. 2 ° Whether the Bill of Particulars was in any way affected by the Statute of 1731 27 re 23.

In general, however, the rule was taken out after Appearance and the filing of the Dec laration, but before the Plea. Once the Order for a Bill of Particulars h ad been granted, the plaintiff was required to deliver in writing a particular account of the items in the demand, with an explanation of how and when it arose. And where there has been an Account Current, both the credits and debits should be shown. And, of course, after the receipt of the particulars, the defendant once again was given time within which to plead, such time being regu lated according to the Rules of the Court in which the case was pending. In the Actions of Covenant, Debt on Ar ticles of Agreement, and Special Assumpsit, or in Actions on Matters of Record, accord ing to Martin, 35 an Order for Particulars did not seem necessary. In Tort Actions, as the wrong complained of was usually stated in the Declaration with some certainty, an Order for Particulars was not often demanded; it might be, however, when the Nature of the Tort was of such a character as to make such an Order neces sary and proper. 3 ° And, of course, where the Bill delivered was defective in that it failed to make full disclo sure, a further Bill of Par ticulars might be obtained by Order of the Court.

In this Action the defendant before Answer filed, demanded a Bill of Particulars, which was furnished.

Lyon, 3 N.J,L. 1038, Hornblower, afterwards Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who appeared for the plaintiff, said; ‘“ Our Act on the subject of a Bill of Par ticulars, is not a New Law, but a confirma tion of the Common Law, manifested by Uni versal Practice.’ * “And in a case under the title of Anony - mous, 16 N.1L. 346, Mr. Gifford moved for a rule that he have further time to plead, the Bill of Particulars not having been delivered till the 15th instant, and Mr. Chief Justice Hornblower said: “‘The rule is that the defendant has the same time for pleading, after receiving the Bill of Particulars, that he had at the time of demanding it. The delay in the delivery is not to be counted as part of his time for plead ing.’ And in Tillou v. liutchinson, 15 N.J.L. 178, Mr. Chief Justice Hornblower (at p. 179) said: ‘By the fifty - fourth section of the Prac tice Act, Record Laws of 1821, page 421, the defendant, or his attorney, at any time before plea pleaded, has right to require, and the"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"Page 396 of 735 plaintiff or his at torney, if required, is bound to deliver to the defendant, or his at torney, a copy of any bond, bill or note, on which the declaration is founded.

Section - 54, above referred to, is the same as found Sec. 188 AFTER TIlE DECLARATION AND BEFORE THE PLEA 377 in Pat.L., above referred to.

After the Declaration, the Parties must, at each Stage of the Proceedings in the Action, either: (I) Demur, or (II) Plead: (A) A Dilatory Plea, or (E) A Peremptory Plea, or Plea in Ear IF it is assumed that Every Liability con sists of Two Elements — a given combination of Facts or Events, plus a Rule of Substantive Law attaching legal consequences to those Facts or Events; and if it be remembered that in order to state a good cause of action one need only set out the combination of facts and events, t he Court taking Judicial Notice of the Rule of Law without its statement, the question arises: In how many ways may the defendant resist the Alleged Liability as serted in the Declaration? Confronted with this Alleged Liability, with a Declaration of the Facts only, the Minor Premise, and omitting the statement of the Rule of Law relied upon, the Major Premise, the defendant was compelled to De mur or Plead. He was bound to pursue one or the other of these two courses, until Issue was Tendered, if he desir ed to sustain his Defense. If he neither Pleaded nor Dc inurred, but Confessed the right of the ad - verse party, or appeared but said nothing, the Court immediately Entered Judgment in favor of his adversary; in the former case, as by Confession; in the la tter, where he said nothing, by nil dicit,’ If, however, the defendant Demurred, dis puting the Rule of Law relied upon by the Plaintiff, he raised an Issue of Law, Triable by the Court; if he desired to Plead, thus disputing the Combination of Facts reli ed upon by the plaintiff, he raised an Issue of Fact, Triable by the Jury. If he desired to dispute the Rule of Law relied on by the plaintiff, he could do so by resorting to the procedural device known as the Demurrer, which developed in Two Forms, the Ge neral and the Special Demurrer, with the result that the Pleadings terminated in an Issue of Law, which Issue, once Tendered, must be ac cepted by what was known as a Joinder in De murrer. If the defendant Demurred General ly an Issue of Law was presented as to wheth er the Declaration was Substantively Defec tive; whereas, if the defendant Demurred Specially, an Issue of Law was raised as to whether the Declaration was Formally De fective. 1.

A Dilatory Plea sought to prevent the Entry of a Final Judgment on the Merits, whereas a Plea in Bar sought to bring about a Final Judgment on the Merits, If the defendant desired to prevent a Final Judgment on the Merits, tha t is, if he wished to use a Dilatory Plea, he could resort to any one of three procedural devices, known as one, a Plea to the Jurisdic tion, on the ground that the court had no ju risdiction over either parties or subject mat ter of the action; two, a Ple a in Abatement, which shows some ground for Abating or Defeating the Particular Action, without de stroying the Right of Action itself; or three, a Plea in Suspension of the Action, which offered some reason why the plaintiff was temporarily disabled from pursuing the ac tion at the time. Peremptory Pleas By Way Of Traverse or Confession And Avoidance IF, for any reason, the defendant did not desire to use a Dilatory Defense, or if such Defense proved futile, his only other recourse was to enter a Peremptory Plea or Plea in Bar, which might take either a Negative or Affirmative Form. If the defendant desired to dispute the combination of the fa cts relied upon by the plaintiff, he could do so by re sorting to a procedural device known as a Traverse or Denial, which took one of three forms, one, the General Issue, which generally operated as a blanket denial of all the Ma terial Allegations in the plaintiff’s Declara and tion; two, the Common or Specific Traverse, which denied One or More Material Allega tions in the plaintiff’s Declaration; and three, the Special Traverse, a highly technical form, capable of being used only in limited circum stanc es, which consisted of an inducement, containing affirmative new matter, a denial, and a verification, and which did not termi nate the pleadings. In the case of the Gener al Issue and the Common or Specific Trav erse, the Pleadings terminated in an Issue of Fact, triable by a Jury. In these Forms of Traverse, the General Issue and the Common or Specific Traverse, a Tender of Issue was required, which consisted of a Statement in the Pleading that the defendant was ready to go to the country, or to submit th e issue to a Trial by Jury. If, however, the combination of facts and events and the Rule of Substantive Law re lied upon by the plaintiff was sufficient to constitute a cause of action; if the alleged liability could not be met by a Dilatory Plea or by s ome Form of Negative Plea in Bar, the defendant might dispute the asserted lia bility by stating that the plaintiff had not told the full story, that is, that the defendant was willing to admit the combination of facts set out by the plaintiff, or that the plaintiff had stated a prima fade case, but that there was an additional combination of facts and events, 380 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS Cli. 19 plus an additional Rule of Substantive Law which equalled non - liability, or which changed the legal effect of the All egations ad mitted. The defendant could accomplish this end by use of the procedural device known as a Plea in Confession and Avoidance, which took either one of two forms, one, a Plea by Way of Confession and Avoidance in Justifi cation and Excuse; or two, a Plea by Way of Confession and Avoidance in Discharge, the difference being that the former assumes that no liability ever existed, and the latter as sumes that liability once existed but has ceased to exist because of the happening of some subsequen t fact or event. Thus, to illus trate, in Trespass for Assault and Battery, the Plea of Self - Defense assumes that the defend ant was never liable in point of Substantive Law, whereas in Debt for Five Hundred Dol lars, the Plea of Payment assumes that a deb t which once was existent is now no longer existent because of the happening of some subsequent fact or event, to wit, Payment. Pleas in Confession and Avoidance were ter minated with a statement that the defendant stood ready to verify his facts. It will be observed that if the Pleadings ter minated in a Demurrer, an Issue of Law tri able by the Court, arose; if the Pleadings terminated with some Form of Dilatory Plea, the settlement of the case on its merits suf fered a temporary or permanent delay; if t he Pleadings terminated in a Traverse, in the Form of the General Issue or the Common or Specific Traverse, an Issue of Fact tri able by the Jury arose. But if the defend ant pleads in Confession"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"Page 399 of 735 and Avoidance, tIle pleadings remain open, and no issue emer ges, and the altercatIon continues until an issue is produced either by a demurrer or by a traverse. OThER STAGES OF PLEADING BEYOND THE DECLARATION AND PLEA that the defendant has met this by a Plea in Confession and Avoidance, the next Stage of Pleading is the Replication, after which follows a Rejoinder, a Surrejoinder, a Rebutter and a Surrebutter. Such a result, however, as sumes that the preceding pleading was in each case in Concession and Avoidance. This proc ess continues until one side or the other Tra verses or Demurs, thus producing either an is sue of Pact or of Law. Replication IF we assume that the defendant neither Demurs nor Pleads by way of Traverse, but seeks to evade liability by Pleading in Con fession and Avoidance, the pla intiff, at the Third Stage of the Pleadings, may file a Rep lication to the defendant’s Plea, either Tra versing it — that is, totally denying it — as, if in an action of debt upon bond the defend ant pleads Payment — that he paid the money when due — the plaintif f in his Replication may totally Traverse this Plea, by deny ing that the defendant paid it, or the Repli cation may Confess and Avoid the Plea, by alleging some new Matter or Justification consistent with the Plaintiff’s Declaration. Thus, in an action fo r trespassing upon land whereof the plaintiff is seised, if the defend ant shows a title to the land by descent, and that therefore he had a right to enter, and gives color to the plaintiff, the plaintiff may either Traverse and totally Deny the Fact of th e Descent, or he may Confess and Avoid it, by Replying that true it is that such descent happened, but that since the descent the de fendant himself demised the lands to the plaintiff for term of life. Eejoinder TO the Replication the defendant may file a Pleading known as a Rejoinder, to which the plaintiff may, in his turn, Demur, or Plead, either by way of a Traverse, or in Confession and Avoidance, in a Surrejoinder.

It will be observed that these various Pleadings — Plea, Replic ation, Rejoinder, Sur rejoinder, Rebutter and Surrebutter, — in le gal theory, proceeded ad infinitum, until at some Stage of the Procedure the Pleadings terminated in either a Demurrer, thus raising an Issue of Law, triable by a Court; in some form of Dilat ory Plea, in which instance the settlement of the case on its merits suffered a temporary or permanent delay; or in a Traverse, thus raising an Issue of Fact, tri able by the Jury; but if the defendant in his Plea neither Demurs nor Traverses, but Pleads i n Confession and Avoidance, the Pleadings remain open and do not terminate in either an Issue of Law or of Fact. There fore, the plaintiff, at the Next Succeeding Stage of Pleading, the Replication Stage, may either Demur, or Plead by way of Traverse or in Confession and Avoidance, and so on, ad infinitum, until the plaintiff or defendant ei ther Demurs, raising an Issue of Law, or Traverses, raising an Issue of Fact, thus re ducing the controversy to a"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"Page 400 of 735 single clear - cut well - defined Issue of Law, or of Fact, which is the Primary Function of Pleading. If a party finds the Declaration or other pleadIng opposed to him to be Sufficient in Substance and Defective in Form, Sufficient in Form and Defective In Substance, or In suffi cient in both respects, he has ample ground for Demurrer; but whether he should Demur or Plead is a matter of expediency, or of procedural tactics, which may influence favorably or unfavorably the outcome of the litigation. It may be useful therefore to examine the considerations by which, in view of what has been said about demurrers, the pleader should be governed in making his election to demur or plead. ELECTION TO DEMUR OR PL}L&D — FACTORS ‘tO BE CONSIDERED 192. In many cases, a Party must Demur in order to take advantage of defects, while in others he may, even after Judgment, vaise ob jections which he might also have taken by Demurrer. In many cases it may not be ad visable to Demur, even where a Demurrer would lie. IF the Declaration or other P leading which may be involved is sufficient in both Form and Substance, the pleader has no alternative but to plead. If the Pleading is insufficient in either Form or Substance, there is good ground for either a Special or a General De murrer; but whether the defect should be seized upon or taken advantage of depends upon several factors, If the Pleading be deemed insufficient in Form the pleader must inquire of himself whether it would be worth while to take the objection, in view of the indulgence which t he law allows by way of Amendment; the pleader must also bear in mind that if the defect is not taken advantage of at that Stage of the Pleading, it may be Aided by a Subsequent Pleading, or after such Subsequent Pleading, by Verdict of the Jury, or by the Statutes of Jeofails and Amendments, If the pleader elects to De mur, he must take care to Demur Specially, lest, upon General Demurrer, he should be held excluded from the objection.t If, on the other hand, the Pleading in question is De fective in Substance, it must be determined whether the insufficiency is in the case itself or in the manner of statement, such, for ex t. Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading In Civil Actions, C. II, Of the Principal Rules of PleadIng, 185 (3d Am. ed, by Tyler, Washington, 1898). 382 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 19 ample, as the Omission of an Allegation re quired by the Substantive Law as essential to the Cause of Action or Defense. In the latter case the Defect could easily be cured by an Amendment, hence it may therefore not be worthwhile to Demur. And whether the Defect was of such char acter as an Amendment would remove or not, a further question may arise as to whether it might not be desirable to ignore the objec tion at the moment and plead. By such tac tics a party often gained the advantage of contesting the case with his adversary, in the first instance, by a Trial on the Merits of an Issue of Fact by a Jury; and in the second instance, if he lost on the Trial, by urging the Obj ection in Law, after Verdict and before Judgment, by Motion in Arrest of Judgment, or after Judgment, by Writ of Error. This maneuver, however, may not always prove successful; for though none but Formal Objections are cured by the Statutes of Jeofails and Amendments, 3 there are some Defects of Substance as well as Form which may be Aided by Pleading Over as well as by the Verdict; and therefore, unless the fault be clearly of a kind not to be so Aided, a Demurrer is the only Mode of Objection that can be r elied upon. The additional de lay and expense of a Trial is also sometimes a material reason for proceeding in the regu lar way by Demurrer, and not waiting to Move in Arrest of Judgment, or to bring a Writ of Error. Another reason for demur ring is that C osts are not generally allowed when Judgment is Arrested, nor where it is Reversed upon Writ of Error, but each party pays his own Costs, while on Demurrer the party succeeding obtains his Costs. 4 It has been contended that Argument on Demurrer is usually futile. Time and effort are spent by Lawyers and Courts in criticiz ing Pleadings on points far"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Page 401 of 735 removed from the 3. Id. at 166. merits involved. The Demurring Attorney is engaged in educating his opponent on the Law. The tendency, therefore, is to avoid pointing out important Errors, or pressing them any more than is necessary to raise them on the Record in the Appellate Court. Demurring is seldom more than a waste of time and a means of delay, except (1) where there is some essential element of a Cause o f Action or Defense which is not set up, and which cannot be supplied with any chance of proving it; (2) when the Pleading, al though Good in Substance, is not as definite and certain as it ought to be, and by a Spe cial Demurrer the Pleader may be required to state his case more in detail, thereby giv ing better notice, narrowing the issues, and increasing the risk of Variance in the Proof. In some jurisdictions Special Demurrers for Defects in Form have been abolish ed, but the line between Form and Substance is difficult to draw. To abolish Demurrers entirely, while allowing the same Objections in Point of Law to be raised under another name, is as ludicrous a piece of self - deception as the old Fictions in Ejectment. Some other solution of the abuses must be found. 5 FORCED ISSUES UNDER TUE CODES 193. An early joinder of issue is forced un der Codes which do not permit pleading be yond the answer or reply stage.

In other words, the Demurrer was one of the Proce - dural Devices which aided the Common Law in its Issue - Making Process. While, in a certain sense, a Demurrer is not a Pleading, in another sense, it is a plead ing; that is, in the sense that if it i s inter posed to a Declaration, it will prevent the Entry of a Judgment by Default, 3 in substan tially the same way as would any Defense on the Merits. Thus, for instance, if A de clares in Ejectment, alleging Title, Ouster and Damages, and B fails to Answ er, a Judg ment by Default will he Entered. Such, how ever, would not be the case if B interposed a Demurrer. In the sense that such use of a Demurrer will, like a Plea to the Merits, prevent the Entry of a Judgment by default, it may be regarded as a Plea ding. The Office of a Demurrer THE Office of a Demurrer is to raise an Issue of Law as to whether the Pleading of the Adverse Party, to which the Demurrer is interposed, is sufficient on its Face to sus tain the Cause of Action alleged, or to con stitute a Defense, as the case may be. If a Demurrer is interposed to a Declaration, it On the relation of Procedure to Substantive Law, see, article by Clark, The Handmaid of Justice, 23 Wash. L’,L.Quarterly 296 (1931). 3. But while a Demurrer Is not, I n this limited sense, a Plea, It is so far a Pleading as to prevent the Entry of a Judgment by Default. Oliphant v. Whitney, 34 Cal. 25, 27 (1867). 2. Martin, Civil Procedure at common Law, c. IX, Art. II, 236 (St. Paul, 1905). 386 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS Cli. 20 raises an Issue of Law as to whether, on the Face of the Declaration, assuming the Facts alleged to be true, the plaintiff has stated Facts which, as a Matter of Substantive Law, and the Rules of Pleading, entitle him to the redress which he seeks. If he fails to in - dude an Allegation required by the Substan tive Law, this constitutes a Substantive De fect, which, if Apparent upon the Face of the Declaration, may be reached, at the Pleading Stage by Demurrer; after Verdict and before Judgment, by Mo tion in Arrest of Judgment; and after Judgment, by Writ of Error, and possibly by Motion for Judg ment Notwithstanding the Verdict. At the Trial Stage, the same Defect might possibly be reached by Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, If, however, the pla intiff includes in his Declaration all the Allegations required by the Substantive Law to state a good Cause of Action, but states these Allegations in vio lation of some Rule of Pleading, he is said to be guilty of a Defect in Form, which may be reached a t the Next Succeeding Stage of Pleading by a Special Demurrer. Thus, to illustrate, if the plaintiff in Ejectment, by way of stating Title, alleged that he had a “grant deed” of Blackacre, his Declaration would be bad on Special Demurrer, as having stated an Evidentiary Fact, which violates the Rule of Pleading that the plaintiff should have stated the Ultimate Fact of Title, to wit, that he was “seized” of Blackacre. If he had omitted any statement whatsoever as to Title, he would have been guilty of a Sub stantive Defect, which is"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Page 404 of 735 generally avail able on General Demurrer. Generally speak ing, therefore, a Special Demurrer was used to reach Defects in Form; while a General Demurrer was used to reach Defects in Sub stance; but since a Special Demurrer in clud es a General Demurrer, a Special De murrer may also reach Defects in Substance, for reasons which will be explained in con - nection with the effect of the Statute of De mutters enacted in 1585.~ The Import of a Demurrer in Pleading A Demurrer, as we have seen, imports in Pleading that the Party will await the Judg ment of the Court as to whether he is bound to answer the Pleading of his Adversary. In short, it advances the legal proposition that the Pleading Demurred to is Insuff i c ient in Law to maintain the case stated by the adverse party. 5 A Demurrer may be en tered by either Party and to any Pleading until an Issue is joined; 6 and it may be for insufficiency either in Substance, as that the case shown by the opposite party is wa nt ing in an essential element, as, for example, where a Declaration in Special Assumpsit for Breach of a Contract fails to allege Consid - eration or a Promise; or in Form, as that the Matter Alleged is substantially sufficient, but is stated in such an art ificial manner as to violate a Rule of Pleading. For it is a cardinal principle of Law that every Plead ing must contain Matter Sufficient in Point of Substantive Law to constitute a Cause of Action or a Defense, and that such Matter must be deduced and alleged according to the Form required by Law, or without vio lating any Rule of Pleading as to how Sub stantive Allegations of any character must be set forth; and, if either of these require - 4. 27 Eliz. e. 5, § 1, o statutes at Large 360 (1585). 5.

A Demurrer to a Declaration cannot properly he said to go to the Merits, except in cases where a Judgment on the Demurrer In favor of the defend ant would be a Bar to a subsequent Suit on the Sa me Cause of Action; and this can never be the case where the Declaration is Defective only for the want of some necessary Averment.

It is not an Issue in Fact, but an Issue in Law, the question raised being whether the Pleadin g Demurred to is suffi cient, as a Matter of Law, assuming the Facts to be true because not Denied, to require the party Demurring to answer it. As questions of Law are for the determination of the Court, the Demurrer refers the Issue to the Judgment of th e Court. 8 THE SPEAKING DEMURRER 195. A “Speaking Demurrer” is one which Alleges some New Matter, not Declared by the Pleading against which the Demurrer is aimed and not Judicially Known or Presumed to be true. WHEN a party Demurs to an Adversary’ s Pleading, his object is to raise an Issue in Point of Law as to whether the Facts alleged are sufficient to sustain his opponent’s Cause of Action or Defense, as the ease may be. If the Demurrer is successful it eliminates any necessity to answer on the part of the De murrant. It follows, therefore, that the De murrant must accept the Facts Alleged in the Pleading Demurred to exactly as stated, and 7 - English: Colt & Glover v.

A Demurrer can never be founded upon Matter Collateral to the Pleading which it Opposes, but must always arise on t he Face of the Statement of the Facts itself. THE distinction between a Demurrer and Other Pleading is that a Demurrer raises an Objection as to the Intrinsic Insufficiency of the Pleading to which it is interposed,” whereas a Plea, Replication, Rejoinder, or Other Pleading containing a Statement of Facts, undertakes to defeat the adversary by the injection into the Case of Matter Collat eral to that which has been alleged by the adversary. Because of this distinction, the Common - Law Rule and the Rule under the Statute of Anne (1705)15 was that a Party could not Plead and Demur at the Same Time to the Same Matter. The defendant was not, at Common Law, permitted to Plead and Demur because of the incongruity between the P lea and the Demurrer.

See Gould, A ‘Treatise on the Principles of Plead ing Pt. III, Of Pl eading, 340 (6th Cd. by Will, Albany 1909). the Demurrant must be careful not to make his Demurrer too large, and not to violate the Rule against Pleading and Demurring at the Same Time to the Same Matter. ThE Demurrer may be used as an offen sive instrument for an attack upon an Ad versary’s Pleading. And such attack may be directed at the whole of the Plaintiff’s Cause of Action or the Defendant’s Defense, as the case may be, or to a Part Only. In making such a use of the Demurrer, a defendan t, in Demurring to a Declaration in its Entirety, must be certain that his Demurrer is not too large.’ 7 Thus, for example, in Cochran v. Scott,” the plaintiff Declared as the indorsee of a Promissory Note, payable to the Law rence Power Company, Alleging a n indorse ment by the company, without setting forth the names of the members of the firm; he also Declared on several Money Counts; the defendant Demurred to the Whole Declara - tion, Assigning Special Cause for only One Count, and None for the others; and the Court gave Judgment for the plaintiff. Where a Declaration contains Several Counts or Statements of Causes of Action, some good in both Form and Substance, and some De fective, the defendant should Demur only to the Defective Counts, as Judgment will b e given against him on an exception to the whole declaration, separate and divisible parts of it being good? 9 A Demurrer may sometimes be taken to part of a single Count or Plea, where the matters alleged are dis tinct and divisible in their nature. 9 ° It Powdiek v.

The General and Special Demurrer Under the Regime of Oral Pleading PRIOR to the Statute of Elizabeth (1585) ~25 cited or described in the books as the Statute of Demurrers, and an important Statute of Jeofails, 2 ° there were Two Kinds of Demurrer, the General Demurrer and the Special. According to the case, Anony mous, 27 d ecided in 1704, and in which the opinion rendered was by Chief Justice Holt of the Court of King’s Bench, upon a General Demurrer, a Party might take advantage of all Types of Defects, Formal or Substantive, 28 25. 27 Bus. c. 5, 6 Statutes at Large 360. 2 6. The word “Jeofails” means, I have failed; I am in error - Certain Statutes in English Law are re ferred to as Statutes of Amendment and Jeofails, because where a Pleader perceives any slip in the Form of his Proceedings, and acknowledges the er ror (jeof ails) he is at liberty by those Statutes to Amend it. For a complete list of the Statutes, the earliest of which was enacted in 1340, 14 Edw. III, e. 6, 1 Stat utes at Large 474, see article by Reppy, The Hilary Rules and Their Effect on Negative and Affi rmative Pleas Under Modem Codes and Practice Acts, C N.Y.tLL,Rev. 95, 100, n. 19 (1929).

Upon a Special Demurrer, so called because it Assigned a Specific Cause of Demurrer, Ordinary Formal Defects were available as on a General Demurrer. As these Ordinary Formal Defects were reached by a General Demurrer, without the necessity of specif i cally pointing them out as was required in a Special Demurrer, the Latter Form of De murrer was never necessary, except in a case inv olving Duplicity. 29 In such case it was not sufficient to say that the Pleading was Dou ble, or contained Two Matters, but the Party Demurring was required to show of what the Duplicity consisted. 3 ° Perhaps the reason for this Exception may be discovered i n the peculiarity of this Specific Defect. Techni cally, Duplicity constituted neither a Formal nor a Substantive Defect, that is, it was not a Substantive Defect, because not too few, but rather too many Facts had been alleged; and it was not a Defect in Form, for what was al - leged had been stated without violation of a Rule of Pleading, hence the Only Defect pres ent — the statement of Superfluous Facts — was held to be available only on Special De murrer. What the Statute of Elizabeth Provided WHAT did th e Statute of Elizabeth provide and what was the effect of such provision? 29 - Ibid. Duplicity in the Declaration was a common Ground for Special Demurrer at Common Law. Handy v. Chatfield, 23 Wend. (N.Y.) 35 (1840). But for the attitude of the courts of today on Duplicity, see Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co. v. Bates Expanded Steel Truss Co., 11 P.24 415 (19213). And in Eng land, under the influence of the Common Law l’r’o eedure Act, 1552 (15 & 16 viet. C. 76, § 51), which provided that “No Pleading shall be deemed insuf ficient for any Defect which could heretofore o,,ly be objected to by Special Demurrer,” Duplicity, along with other Formal Defects, ceased to be available on Demurrer. The remedy Is now by Mo tion. 30. Lamplougli v.

The phrase, “according as the Very Right of the Cause and Matter in Law shall appear unto them” translated into plain English, means that the Judges thereafter shall decide the Cases on the Merits, and in complete di s regard of any imperfection, defect or watt of Form in any Pleading, except those only which the Demurring Party specifically points out and sets down “together with his Demurrer.” What Demurrer? Answer, the General Demurrer. A Special Demurrer therefore, under the Statute, is merely a General Demurrer, to which is added a spec ification or pointing out of some Defect in Form in an Adversary’s Pleading, as indicat ed by the italicized part of the Form of a Special Demurrer set out above. In other words, th e Statute provides that Defects in Form are aided or waived unless taken ad vantage of by Special Demurrer at the next Succeeding Stage in Pleading. Defects in Form, after the Statute, might, however, still prove fatal, but only if specifi cally objected to by openly pointing out the defect at the next Stage of Pleading. 3 ’ Thus, 31. “This Statute, by making kuown the Causes of Demurrer, was so far restorntive of the common Law; and as a General Demurrer before did con fess all Matters Formaliy Pleaded, so by this Stat ute, whenever the right sufficiently appeared to the Court, it confessed all Matters, though Pleaded in formally.” 8 Tidd, The Practice of the Court of King’s Bench, c. XXX, 649 (1st. Sin. ed., Philn delphia 1807). See, also, English: ICing v. Botham, Freem. 38, 89 Eng.Bep. 31 (1672); Illinois: Cook v. Scott, 1 Gil - man (Th.) 333 (1844); Gordon v. Bankard, 37 Iii. 147 (1863); Cover v. Armstrong, 66 Ill. 267 (1872); Mas in the famous case of Heard v. Baskervile,~ decided in 1614, or only twent y - nine years after the Enactment of the Statute, the Court concluded, upon finding a Defect in a Plead ing to be a Matter of Form, that the Defect could not be taken advantage of upon Gen eral Demurrer, as “a General Demurrer doth confess all matters plead ed”, though not pleaded in proper form. A General Demur rer, therefore, automatically waives all De fects in Form, except in the case of a General Demurrer to a Plea in Abatement, 33 What the Statute of Anne Provided THE Kinds and Forms of Deinurrers after 1705 remained substantially the same, except for a slight alteration in the Scope of the Special Demurrer. The Statute of Anne (1705), was merely a Reenactment of the Statute of Elizabeth (1585), almost word for word , with a proviso that “sufficient Matter appear in the said Pleadings, upon which the Court may give Judgment according to the Very RAght of the Cause,” 34 plus an enumera tion of Certain Defects, which upon the con struction of the Prior Statute, had been held to be Substantial, but which were now to be held Formal, and hence Aided upon General Demurrer, the conservative views of the Judges to the contrary notwithstanding.

A proviso In the Statute of Anne 394 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS C h . 2 0 plaintiff failed to allege the writing, this was held to be a Defect available on Demurrer. 43 Exception to the General Rule as to Defects Available upon a General Demurrer WHILE the General Rule is that upon a General Demurrer only Defects in Substance are available, there is an exception to the rule where the plaintiff files a General De murrer to a Plea in Abatement Defective in Form. 4 ’ In Humphrey v. Whitten,~ where the plaintiff brought Ti - over against the de fendant in the name of James Humplvreys, the defendant Pleaded that he was and “always had been known by the name of James Humphrey, and n ot James Humphreys, as by the plaintiff’s Writ supposed, to which Plea the plaintiff Demurred Generally. Since the defendant’s Plea contained New Matter, in order to be in Proper Form, it should have concluded with a Verification, which it did not contain. There was therefore a question as to whether a Defect in Form in a Plea in Abatement could be reached by a General De murrer after the Statute of Elizabeth and the Statute of Anne. In reviewing the Common Law, the Court concluded that the General Demurrer reached the Defect in Form — the failure to have a Verification — in the Plea in Abatement. Why? Because, at Common Law, prior to the Statute, a General Demur rer reached both Defects in Form and De fects in Substance in a Pleading to which it was interposed, and since the Statute of Elizabeth and the Statute of Anne only ap plied to Pleas in Bar, the Original Common Law as to the Scope of a General Demurrer to a Plea in Abatement was not changed, and therefore, as a General Demurrer reached a Defect in Form in a Plea in Abatement be fore 1585, it still reached it after 1585, the 43.

Common - Law Rule not having been dis turbed, Thus, the Exception to the General Rule that in order to reach a Defect in Form in a Pleading after the Statute of Demurrers, you must Demur Specially. 46 The General Rule as to Defects Available Upon a Special Demt~rrer After the Stat ute of Elizabet!v (1585) and the Statute of Anne (1705) THE General Rule was that upon a Special Demurrer any Defect in Form, as created by a Violation of a Rule of Pleading as to the Manner and Form in which a Substantive Al legation should be Averred, was available, if the Cause of Demurrer was Specifically As signed. Thus, for example, Uncertainty of Allegation, Improper Ending of a Plea, Joinder of Several Causes of Action in a single Count, or any other Violation of a Rule of Pleading, constitutes a Defect in Form. In addition, as observed above, as a Special Demurrer is, under the Statute of Elizabeth (1585), merely a General Demurrer to which has been added a specification of some De fect in Form in the Adversary’s Pleading, Defects in Substance were also reached by a Special Demurrer. The Defect of Duplicity PRIOR to the Statute of Elizabeth (1585), the Defect of Duplicity (which was neither a Formal nor a Substantive Defect) was, as a 46. Shaw v. Duteher, 19 Wend.

After the Statute, Duplicity, despite its peculiarity as a fault, was treated as a Formal Defect, and hence available upon a Snecial Demurrer. 47 But in Oklahoma Gas c~ Electric Co. v. Bate s Ex panded Steel Truss Co., 48 where the defendant Demurred Specially to the First and Second Counts of an Amended Declaration in Case on the Ground of Duplicity, the Court, regarding the Rules of Pleading as but juridical instru mentalities for the furthe rance of Justice, and taking note of a statutory requirement that pleadings should be framed to promote “conciseness, brevity and plainness”, over ruled the Demurrer, where at Common Law the Demurrer would have been sustained. And in England, under the inf luence of the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852, which provided that “no Pleading shall be deemed insufficient for any Defect which could here tofore only be objected to by Special Demur rer,” ~ Duplicity, along with other Formal Defects, ceased to be avail able on Demurrer.

To this General Rule, however, there were at least Five Exceptions , that is, there were some situations in which a mere Viola tion of a Rule of Pleading was held as a Mat ter of Precedent to constitute a Defect in Substance, and therefore could be taken ad vantage of on General Demurrer. This re - ’ suited in case of (1) a Departure; (2) a Dis continuance; (3) a Mispleader; (4) a Mis conception of the Correct Form of Action; and (5) a Misjoinder of Counts.

It follows that, in our practice, Special Demurrers as known in the Common Law have bec,i iinphiedly abolishcd, and therefore Duplicity in Pleading, being, as we have seen , a Defect In Form, is to be reached by an appropriate Motion under the Provisions of FL. 1578.

Two Fundamental Rules Covet - fling Admis sions by Dernun’er THERE are Two Rules that Gover n Ad missions by Demurrer. The first Rule is that a Demurrer will admit any Fact that is Well. Pleaded 04 and will not admit any Fact that is JllPleaded; ~ the second Rule is that a Demurrer will not admit any Fact which the Court takes Judicial Notice to be impossible or untrue. And the Technical Objective of these two rules was to test the Legal Effect of the Allegations to which they were ad dressed and to aid in the Issue - Formulation Process of Separating Questions of Fact from Questions of Law, for ready reference to the Court or Jury, depending on whether the Pleadings terminated in an Issue of Fact or an Issue of Law. CIt 20 Sec. 199 THE DEMURRER 3 9 7 A Demurrer wiTh Admit any Fact thzzt is Well - Pleaded and Will not Admit any Fact that is Ri - Pleaded"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"Page 416 of 735 IN connection with the first Rule, the ques tion arises as to when is a Fact Well - Pleaded or Ill - Pleaded? A Fact is We]1 - Pieaded when it is required by the Substantive Law as es sential to the Statement of a Cause of Actio n or Defense, and is then Pleaded without Vio lating any Rule of Pleading. A Fact is Ill - Pleaded when it is not required by the Sub stantive Law as essential to the Statement of a Cause of Action or Defense, or when, being so required, it is then Pleaded i n Violation of one or more Rules of Pleading. Thus if A sued B in Ejectment and Alleged, by way of Title, that he was Seized of Black - acre, the Allegation of Title was Well - Plead ed, because it was required by the Substan tive Law of Real Property as essen tial to the Statement of a Cause of Action in Ejectment, and because it was Alleged without Violating any Rule of Pleading. If, however, A had Alleged, by way of Title, that he had a Grant Deed of Blackacre, his Allegation of Title would have been Ill - Plea ded, as a Deed is Mere Evidence of Title, and amounts to the Statement of an Evidentiary Fact, a Defect available on Special Demurrer. Assuming that the Facts are Well - Pleaded, a Demurrer thereto admits, for the Purpose of Argument, that they are true, 5 ° a nd the only question for the Court is one of Law as to whether there is any Rule of Substantive Law attaching Legal Effect to the Facts U. English: Barber v. Vincent, Freem.K.B. 531, 89 Eng.Rcp. 398 (1580); Connecticut: Lamphear v. Buekingbam, 33 Conn. 237 (1866); Illinois: coin pher v. People, 12 III. 290 (1850); Nhspcl v.

Mortar, 26 Vt. 271 (1544), And, see also, Dickerson v. Winslow, 07 Ala. 491, 11 So. 918 (1892). Stated. 57 The Rule is subject, however, to the qualification that the Matter must be suffi c iently Pleaded, that is in the Manner and Form required by LaW. 58 If the Facts were not Alleged in Proper Form, they were not admitted by a Demurrer under the Common - Law Rule which prevailed prior to the Stat ute of Elizabeth (1585) and the Statute of Anne (1705) P° This Rule was changed by these Statutes, the Law of Demurrers being altered in such a way that thereafter Facts not Alleged according to the Form required by Procedural Law, might be admitted by Dem urrer in some instaiwes.~° This usually results where the Demurrer is General, in stead of Special, as this usually amounts to a Confession of the Matter Informally Pleaded, thus qualifying the earlier Common - Law Rule that a Demurrer did not admit an E Ple aded Fact.& A Demurrer does not admit Conclusions, either of Fact or of Law, which the Adverse Party may have seen fit to draw in his Plead ingP Thus, in Milivilte Gas Light Company 57.

Sweeten, &c., et aZ.,C the plaintiff Alleged that the defendants, under a contract with the city of Miliville, for the construction of a sewage system, dug up certain streets in the city where the plaintiff had laid gas pipes, which it thcreupon became the defendants’ duty to su pport, protect and render safe dur ing the construction of the sewage system, and that in disregard of this duty the pipes were so negligently supported that they be came broken, and severed, to the injury of plaintiff. The only information derivable from the plaintiff’s Declaration, with refer ence to the existence of the defendant’s Duty to plaintiff, was that plaintiff’s pipes were “laid in the said streets by competent and le gal authority.” On a Demurrer by the de fendant, it was held that the Demurrer did not admit the plaintiff’s Allegation as to its authority to occupy the highway with its pipes; in short, a Demurrer does not admit a Conclusion of Law. But this is not always so. When the plain tiff, in stating title to real estate alleges that he is seized of Blackacre, he is Alleging a Conclusion of Law, yet if the defendant Demurs, he will lose, as this particular Con clusion of Law is one which, as a Matter of Precedent in Law, is treated as a Statement of Ultimate Fact, and hence the Demurrer ad mits it. So, when we say that a Demurrer will not admit a Conclusion of Law, we refer to that type of Conclusion of Law, which, as a Matter of Precedent, is not treated as a Statement of Ultimate Fact , “Where the Facts are stated in a Pleading the Pleader may, and often should, state that Conclusion from such Facts upon which he bases his right, but where the Facts upon which the Pleader’s Conclusion is based are not stated his Conclusicyn from such Un dis conclusions, whether stated in the Complaint or not, that a Demurrer Is directed, and to which It applies the proper test.” Branham y.

The de fendant says, “I win, because, by your D e murrer you admit a lack of Service.” But the plaintiff wins, because a Demurrer does not admit a Fact which the Court by Judicial Notice knows to be untrue. Whether the de fendant was served can only be Seen from looking at the Return of the Sheriff, whi ch states that the defendant has been Served. The Return of the Sheriff is a part of the Common - Law Record, the Court Judicially Notices its own Record, hence the Court Judicially knows that defendant has been Served, that the defendant’s allegation of lac k of service is untrue, and what the Court Judicially knows to be untrue is not admitted by Deniurrer 6 ° This does not apply to facts of which the Court cannot take Judicial No tice, though the Court may have private knowledge that they are untrue. Thus, in the case of Hodges v. Steward,’° in which the plaintiff brought Assumpsit upon an In land Bill of Exchange, declaring upon a Spe cial Custom in London for the bearer to bring the Action, and the defendant Demurred, it was held that since the Court only Ju dicially Noticed the general Law of Merchants, as part of the Law of England, whereas this custom was a local custom of England, the Demurrer admitted the local custom, even in the face of the fact that the Court might have known of its own knowledge that no such local custom existed. Accordingly, Judgment was given for the plaintiff, al though the defendant might have had a good Defense if he had Traversed or Denied the local custom, instead of Demurring. months and ten dayc, were not vaiuable, as it was i ncapable of performing valuable service. 4°.

Will a Demurrer Admit the Pleader’s Conclu sions as to the Construction of a Statute~ AN interesting aspect of Admission by De murrer as affected by the Doctrine of Ju dicial Notice appears in determining whether a Pleader’s Conclusion as to the Construction of a Statute is Admitted by a Demurrer. The Issue was clearly presented in the Illinois Case of Compher v. People.” This was an Action on a Bond executed by the county col lector, in which the county collector and his sureties were defendants. One of the Pleas, after referring to various Statutes enacted subsequent to the date of the Bond, alleged that thereby the Liability of the sureties was materially changed; and it was insisted that the plaintiffs, by Demurring to the Plea, ad mitted to the truth of the Construction of the Statutes as set forth by the defendants. The Court held that the Laws in question were Public Acts, an d that the plaintiffs, by Demurring to a Plea construing them, did not admit such construction to be correct. In considering this problem there are three situations to bear in mind: (1) Where the Action is based upon a Local Statute, and the Pleading sets out the Statute in Substance or Verbatim, the construction of the Pleader is not admitted by Demurrer, as the Court takes Judicial Notice of Local Law; (2) Where a Pleading sets out the Terms of a Foreign Statute, and then places a construc tion upon it, s uch construction is not admit ted by Demurrer; 72 and (3) where the Plead ing states the Substance of a Foreign Stat ute, it is treated as any other Allegation of Fact, and hence is admitted by Demurrer. as the Court will not take Judicial Notice of a Fore ign Statute.’ 3 71. 12 Ill. 290 (1550). 72.

And, on Demurrer to a Replication, if the Court regards the Replica tion bad, but perceives a Substantive Defect in the Plea, Judgment will be given, not for the defendant, but for the plaintiff, provided the Declaration is good as a Matter of Sub stantive Law; but if the Declaration is De fective in Point of Substance, then, upon the same principle, Judgment would be given in favor of the defendant, 77 The Demurre r, at whatever Stage of the Pleadings it is inter posed; reaches back in its effect, through the Whole Record, and ultimately attaches to the First Substantive Defect in the Plead - not show a Cause of Action, Judgment shall be giv en against the plai ntiff and the Complaint dis missed, (Code, See. 148).

Exceptions to the Qetterai Rule The first Exception occurs where the plaintiff Demurs to a Plea in Abatement. Thus, for instance, let us suppose that A sues in Ejectment, but fails to allege Title, that .8 pleads that he was sued in the wrong County, but fails to give the plaintiff a better Writ, or to tell him in what County he might be sued in. This is a Plea in Abat e ment, Defective in Form for failure to give the plaintiff a Better Writ. Now, suppose A Demurs Generally to the Plea. Does the Demurrer reach back to the Defect in the plaintiff’s Declaration, that is, his Failure to allege Title, If it were permitted to do so, the defendant would win the case on the Merits, without having taken any chance of losing it on the Merits, as, with one Ex ception, on a Plea in Abatement the Judg ment is never on the Merits. In order to prevent the defendant from winning when, by his Plea hi Abatement he took no chance of losing on the Merits, an Exception to the Rule as to the retrospective effect of a Demurrer was created where the Demurrer was interposed to a Plea in Abatement, and where, to permit the Demurrer to search the Whole Record, would sooner or later, as illus trated by the case above, result in a victory for the defendant where he had no chance to lose. 82 The second Exception arises where there has been a discontinuance along one of sev eral lines of Pleading. An ex ample of this 82. Professor Charles A, ICeigwin explains this point as follows: ‘Pleas in Abatement are not within the Operation of the Usual Ruie, and that for two rea sons: (1) in Point of Policy such Pleas are dis couraged, because odious in Law and oft en preju dicial to Justice; and (2) in Point of Principle, a flea in Abatement is addressed, not to the Declara tion, but to the writ npon which the Declaration is based, and the Purpose of the Plea is to Abate or quash the Writ for some Defect in the fram ing of the case. Therefore, on Demurrer to a Flea in Abatement, the defendant cannot turn the Demur rer against the Declaration. Should the Plea be Re plied to and the Replication Demurred to, the gen eral principle operates so far as to carry the De murre r back to the Plea, but not to make available any Objections to the Declaration.” Cases in Com mon Law Pleading.

May, 83 in which the plaintiff declared in Assumpsit against A, B and C. Two of the defendants, A and B, pleaded a Debt of Record by way of set - off, without taking any notice of the third. The plaintiff Replied Nul Tiel Record, and gave a day to produce the Record to the two defendants A and B, but entered no suggestion on the roll respecting the third, C. To this Replication, there was a General Demurrer. The Court held that the plaintiffs having Replied to a Plea by two of the de fendants without taking notice of the third against whom they declared, had made a discontinuance; that the Cause being discon tinued, Judgment must be given against the plaintiffs, as they were not in a position to take advantage of the Defect in the defend ant’s Plea. 84 To put the matte r in another way, the plaintiffs, by neglecting to sign Judgment against the defendant, on Allega tions the latter failed to answer, caused a Discontinuance of the Action. The principle involved was that the plaintiff, by omitting to follow up his entire d emand against the three defendants, created an interruption in the proceedings, which is technically known as a “Discontinuance,” and which creates an Error on the Record. The commission of this fault places the plaintiff where he is in no position to ask for Judgment; but such an Error is now generally cured by ona of the Statutes of Jeofails, 85 after Verdict, as well as after Judgment. The third Exception may appear where a defendant interposes more than one Plea, one of which is a Plea of the General Iss ue, and there is a Demurrer at a later Stage in the Pleadings.

It. v. v. York: Rhode The earliest mention of this Rule In Illinois was in Brawner v. Lomsx, 2.3 In. 496 (1860), which was decided without any reference to the New York de cisions. Wear V. Jacksonville & Savaonah l t. F.

To the contrary, the Retroactive Operation of Demurrer wns consciously per,nitted by the English Ct,nrts in this instance. In an account of certain features of the Common Law Pra ctice, it was nuthoritatively said in 1830: “The defendant occasionally resorts to the expedient of Pleading in addition to some Plea sufficient in Point of Law, another which he knows to he insufficient, but to contain a True Statement of Facts, He thus s ometimes succeeds in compelling the plaintiff to take Issue in Fact upon the First Plea, and to Demur to the Second; and, as upon the Argument of the Demurrer, the Court looks to the Whole Record, and decides against the Party First In Fault, the defendaht , instead of supporting his Second Plea, attacks the Declaration, and thus, In ef fect, both Demurs and Pleadi to the Declaration.” Third Report of Commissioners on the Superior Courts of Commob Law, 26 (London, 1830). of a is an ts, 76 ‘~. Ibid. 404 DEFEN SIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 20 well - established Rule that the defendant could not Both Plead and Demur to the same Count. 88 The fourth Exception occurs where tile plaintiff Demurs to a Plea which has been entered by the defendant after his Demurrer to the Declaration has been overruled. Some Courts hold, as, for example, in Stearns v. 88. In referring to this specific point, Bronson, C. J., observed: It is quite clear that the defendant cannot both Plead and Demur to the Same Count. And it is equally clear, that at the Common Law, lie could not have Two Pleas to the Same Count. Indeed the two things, though stated in different ‘verdi, are only parts of one Common - Law Rule; to wit, that the defendant cannot make Two An swers to the Same Pleading. The S tatute c:f 4 and 5 Anne, e. 16, was made to remedy this inconveni ence; and it allowed the defendant, with the leave of the Court, to Plead as many Several Matters as he should think necessary for his defence. With us, leave of the Court is no longer neces sary. (2 ItS. 352, ~ 9). The Statute does not say that the defend ant may both Plead and Demur; and consequently lie ep.unot make Two Such Answers. But he moy Plead Two or More Pleas; sonic of which may term inate in Issues of Fact, to be tried by a Jory; while others may result in Issues of Law, to be determined by the Court. And whenever we come to a Demur rer, whether it be to the Plea, Replication, Rejoinder, or still further onward, tile Rule is to give Judg inert against the Party who committed the Fi rst Fault in Pleading, if the Fault be such as would maine the Pleading bad on General Demurrer. This finle has always prevailed. It was the Rule prior to the Statute of Anne; and to say that the defend ant, because he Pleads Two Pleas, one of which re sul ts Ia a Demurrer, cannot go back and attack the Declaration, would he to deprive him of a por tion of the privilege which the Legislature intend ed to confer. lie eannet Plead and Demur at the Same Time, because the Common Law forbids it; and the Statute d oes not allow it. But he may Plead Two fleas; and be takes the right with all its legitimate consequences; one of which is, that whenever there comes a Demurrer upon either of the two Lines of Pleading, be may run back upon that line to see which Party com mitted the First Fault; and against that Party Judgment will be rendered. Aside from the dicta in question, there is not a shadow of authority, either here or in Eng land, for a different Doctrine.” The Auburn & Owasco Canal Co. t Lelteh, 4 DeMo (N.Y.) 65, 67 (1847). Cope, that where the defendant has Dc murred to the Declaration, his Demurrer has been overruled, and he has Pleaded over, an Exception is created to the General Rule, and the Court having once passed on the suf ficiency of the Declaration, it is incompetent for the same tribunal, at a succeeding term to reverse the decision; also, that the defend - ant having submitted to the first decision, he thereby waived the Defect in the Declaration, if any. But in Cummins v. Gray,°° the oppo site view wa s taken. Where Plaintiff has not put his Action on the Proper Ground AS has been observed, the Court will gen erally consider the Whole Record, and give Judgment for the Party who, on the whole, appears entitled to it. But where, though the right, on the W hole Record, appears to be with the plaintiff, if he has not put his Action on that ground, the defendant will prevail. Thus, where, in an Action on a Covenant to perform an Award, and not to prevent the arbitrators from making it, the plaintiff Declared in Covenant, and Assigned, as a Breach, that the defendant"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"Page 425 of 735 would not pay the sum Awarded, and the defendant Pleaded a revocation of the au thority of the arbitrators by deed, before Award made, to which the plaintiff De murred, the Court held the Plea good as being a sufficient answer to the Breach alleged, and therefore gave Judgment for the defendant, although they were of opinion that the matter stated in the Plea would have entitled the plaintiff to maintain his Action if he had alleged, by way of Breach, 89. 109 Ill. 340 (1854). Bistorically, It may be said that no such Rule was developed by the English cases, and in Illinois, it originated with the ease of Brawner v.

Estoppel, and Facts thus established can never afterwards be contested between the same Parties, or those in Privity with them, in a nother Suit. 2 If, therefore, on a De murrer to a Declaration, Judgment is Ren dered for the defendant, the plaintiff can never afterwards maintain against the same defendant, or those in Privity with him, any similar action upon the same Grounds as were di sclosed in the First Declaration, unless such Judgment result from the Omission of an Essential Allegation. In the latter instance the Judgment would be No Bar to a Second Action supplying the Missing Allegation; nor is it a Bar, where the Action is miscon ceived, to an Action afterwards brought in proper form. The Ground upon which the Estoppel rests, in these instances, is a deter mination of the Merits of the Action, which, by Reason of the Admitted Facts shown upon the Record, the Unsuccessful Party is pre cluded from again bringing into question. And the result confirms the view that one of the Fundamental Functions of Pleading is to Preserve a Record of a Controversy once Litigated, in order to serve as a basis of a Plea of Res Judicata, and thus preve nt the Relitigation of a Cause once settled.

It seems doubtful whether the Change has been one other than in the name used to describe the Procedural Device by which an Objecting Party may Assert his Right to Re fuse to An - swer. IN some States, under Modern Coëes, Prac tice Acts, and Rules of Court, the Demurrer has been abolished, 3 but in lieu thereof the same Defects, formerly available on Demur rer, may generally be reached by Motion. Thus, in New Jersey, the Rules pro vided: Rule 26. “Demurrers Are Abolished. Any Pleading may be struck out on Motion on the Ground that it discloses no Cause of Action, Defense or Counterclaim respective ly. The Order made upon such Motion is Ap pealable after Final Judgment. In lieu of a Motion to Strike Out, the same Objection, and any Point of Law (other than a question of Pleading and Practice) may be raised in 3. For an enumeration and discussion of Code pro visiens Abolishing the Demurrer, see Clark, Hand book of tie Law of Code Pleading, c. A, § 86, pp. 535 — 545 12d ed, St. Paul, 1947). the Answering Pleadings, and may be dis posed of at, or after, the Trial; but the Court, on Motion of either Party, may determine the question so raised before Trial, and if the De cision be decisive of the whole case the Court may give Judgment for the Successful Party or make such order as may be Just.” Rule 27 provided: “Objections to Plead ings other than those provided for in Rule 26 above, shall be Made by Motion. The Action of the Court thereon is appealable after Final Judgment.” Rule 28 provided: “Every Motion ad dressed to a Pleading must present every Cause of Objection then existing.” How effective this Reform was is clearly seen in Savage v. Public Service Ry. Co., 5 in wh ich the plaintiff in a cause for personal injuries alleged that, as a passenger while standing on the rear platform of the car, about to enter the body of the said car, she was suddenly jerked from her feet and thrown to the floor of the car “by the negli gent operation thereof.” After the Pleadings were completed, and the case came on for Trial, on the basis of a Reserved Right, the defendant Moved to Strike Out the Complaint on the Ground that the Complaint disclosed no Cause of Action; in that a General Allega tion of Negligence was Insufficient. The Motion was sustained, Judgment was entered, whereupon the defendant Appealed. After adverting to the abolition of the Demurrer by the provisions as set out above, the Court then proceeded with the discussion of the Issue as to whether a General Allega tion of Negligence was good as against the Motion. Chief Justice Gummere declared: “The question upon which the determina tion of this Appeal depends is whether the Complaint could have been successfully at tacke d by a General Demurrer, upon the Ground that it disclosed no Cause of Action; and we think that it must be answered in the • can I the :hem, iDe Ren can same any were such an tance Icond Ltion; scon ht in Fi the leter ‘hich, upon pre stion.

Van Horn, 38 N.J.L. 133, 138, the defendant interposed a Demurrer to the Sec ond Count of a Declaration, which showed merely that the plaintiff was in one of t he cars of the defendant company under a duty by it to carry her safely, and while there that she was, ‘through the negligence, carelessness and misdirection of the defendant and its agents and servants, thrown from and under the coaches of the said defend ant.’ It svas held by the Supreme Court that, although this Averment was so uncertain and insufficient in detail as to afford the defendant little, if any, information as to what the Specific Act of Negligence was, or what agency of the company was respons ible for it, it was clearly good on a General Demurrer, the Defect being one of Form and not of Sub stance. In Breese ‘s’. Trenton Horse Rail road Co., 52 Id. 250, 253, a Count which stated in General Terms that by the careless management of the car in a p ublic street by the agents of the defendant it thereby ran over the body and arm of the plaintiff, was held good on a General Demurrer. In Race v. Easton and Amboy Railroad Co., 62 Ic!. 536, a Count in a Declaration simply Averring, in effect, that by reas on of the negligent and improper running of defend ant’s railroad train, and blowing of the whistle on its locomotive, a horse which was being driven on the highway by the plaintiff became frightened and overturned the wag on, and that plaintiff was thereb y thrown out and injured, although not specific enough for a proper Pleading was permitted to stand as against a General Demurrer. Ferguson v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 64 Id. 222, is to the same effect. In Minnuci v. Philadel phia and Reading Railroad Co., 68 Id. 432, it was declared that an Averment in a Decla ration which stated that the plaintiff’s In juries were caused solely by the negligence of the defendant, without more, although it did not fulfill the requirement of the Rule Ch.20 of Pleading that the certainty of the State ment of the Plaintiff’s Case must be such as in a reasonable measure to apprise the Defendant of the case to be made against him, was good on General Demurrer.” From the foregoing, it would seem clear that in New Jersey the abolition of the De murrer, in effect, was in name only. 6 The Federal Solution of the Problem THE New Federal System, 7 provides for the abolition of the Demurrer, and the State ment of All Defenses in Law or Fact in the Responsive Pleading, where one is r equired. It also permits certain Defenses to be raised by Motion, which may be heard and deter mined in advance of Trial, or the Court may order the hearing and determination of the Motion deferred until the Trial. Additionally, under the Federal Rules,t where a party contends that the opposing pleading has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matter outside the pleading may be presented to and con sidered by the Court, and in such event the Motion will be treated as one for Summary Ju dgment."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Page 430 of 735 Effect of Reform Sum,nwrized WHAT, one may well ask, has been accom plished in the states by substituting the Motion in lieu of the Demurrer? At first glance, it may appear that this change has been quite sweeping in its effect, whereas, in fact, it is more of a change in Form than in Substance, because in order to determine the Scope of the substituted Motion, it is necessary to understand the Scope of the Demurrer, as it exists and operates at Com mon Law.

If it is asked, what does a Motion Admit, the answer is, it Admits substantially the Same Facts as were formerly Admitted by a Demurrer. If the question is, what Defects in Pleading may be reached by a Motion, the reply is, the Same Defects which, at Common Law, were available upon General or Special De murrer. If it is inquired, how far does a Motion Open up the Record, the answer is, back to the Declaration or Complaint, just as the De murrer did; and finally, if it be asked, what Exceptions are there to the General Rule as to the Retrospective Effect of the Motion, the answer is, the Same as at Common Law, in so far as those Excep tions are susceptible of application to a Code System of Pleading which ordinarily does not extend beyond the Replication Stage. It thus appears that, except for the change in nomenclature, or the substitution of the name “Motion” in place of the name “De murrer”, and except for the fact that a Mo tion may com e up f or Argument on five days notice, whereas a Demurrer came up for Argument on twenty days notice, there is in general no substantial difference between the Motion and the Demurrer, and it may be questioned whether sufficient gain has been registered t o justify the change, with its resultant confusion and litigation.

IF the defendant does not Demur to the plaintiff’s Declaration, his only alternative is to seek to dispute the alleged liability by some Form of Plea. Pleas are separ ated into Two Classes: first, Dilatory Pleas, or Pleas which seek to prevent a Final Judgment on the merits; 2 second, Peremptory Pleas, or Pleas more popularly known as Pleas in Bar, which seek to bring about a Final Judgment on the merits. 3 Pleading — Plea in Abatement — Code, 18 Micli.Ldtev. 433 (1920).

Dilatory Pleas have sometimes been referred to by the generic name of Pleas in Abatement, but this term is more prop erly us ed to designate one of the classes into which Pleas of a Dilatory Nature are di vided. The general effect of these Dilatory Pleas is to suspend or terminate the particular Suit, but to leave the cause undetermined on its merits. And this was on the basis that there was an objection to the Action ground ed on principles of Remedial Law as opposed to Substantive Law. And it was necessary that they be Pleaded before Pleas in Bar, which dispose of the Action entirely. Objec tions to the Jurisdiction of the Cou rt, the Service of Process, and the Venue, are more favorably regarded than Pleas in Abatement proper; they do not have to be Verified by Affidavit, nor give the plaintiff a better Writ, and they may be Amended like Pleas in Bar. 4 A mistake in the Formal P rayer for Relief in a Plea in Abatement is fatal to the Plea. 5 At Common Law, Pleas of every descrip tion were required to follow a certain order. 4.

Though a Plea to the Jurisdictloa is not pruporly a Ple a in Abatement, liko such a Plea, it should state what Court has Jurisdiction. .Minch & Eisenbrey Co. v. Cram, 138 Md. 122, 110 A. 204 (1920). In an Action of Trover the defendant’s Plea to the Ju risdiction on the ground that it was a foreign cor poratio n without a place of business or agent in the state was not - within the reason discouraging Dila tory Pleas, or one going merely to a Question of Venue within the State.

Thus, Dilatory Pleas had to be Pleaded be fore Pleas in Bar, and even as between the different Dilatory Pleas, a certain order was required. A Plea to the Jurisdiction of the Person must be taken b efore the de fendant Demurs, Moves, or Offers any other Plea, or he will submit himself to the Juris diction of the Court, TILE ORDER OF DILATORY PLEAS 204. Dilatory Pleas must be Pleaded before any others. Matters of Defense, which tend only to delay o r defeat the particular Suit, withàut destroying the plaintiff’s Right to Sue, must be presented Before Pleading to the Merits of the Action; the order of Pleading Dilatory Objections is in general as followsl (I) Pleas to the Jurisdiction; (II) Pleas in Abatement on Account of the Disability of the Plaintiff; (III) Pleas in Abatement on Account of the Disability of the Defendant; (IV) Pleas in Abatement for Defect of Parties;"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"Page 433 of 735 (1”) Pleas in Abatement for Pendency of Another Action. THE La w has prescribed and settled the Order of Pleading which the defendant should pursue, and although, in some re spects, the division has been objected to as more subtle than useful, the arrangement given above is still adhered to? as will be seen from the C hart set forth on page 412: 6. See the opinion of Chief Justice Bolt in Longue ville v. Inhabitants of Thlstleworth, 2 Ld.Raym. 969, 92 EngRep. 146 (1703); Co.Lltt. 303a (PhLladel pIña, 1853). This Rule can have no application in Code Pleading, as an defenses are to be covered by the answer, save • the objections specified for the use of a Demurrer. In Equity Pleading, however, the analogy is plain, and a logical sequence of Pleas and Answers ac cording to their object is, to a certain extent, still m aIntained. 412 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 21 ORDER IN Wuicu Plaks MUST BE PLEADED DILATORY PLEAS — 1.

The Order, as set out in the Chart above, has been said to be the Natural Order, since each Subsequent Plea admits that there is no foundation for the Preceding Plea, and precludes the defendant from afterwards availing himself of the Matter, as will be seen if the Order be inverted.

Definition and Classification A Plea to the Jurisdiction asserts, by Way of Denial, that a Specific Court has no Ju risdiction to try the Cause of Action present ed by the plaintiff. In this connection, it is important to keep in mind that Courts are either of General or of Limited Jurisdiction. The first Type of Courts have Cognizance over all Transitory Actions, wherever the Cause of Action may have accrued, as All Actions of that kind generally follow the person of the defendant. The latter have Jurisdiction only over Caus es of Action arising within Certain Local Limits. 8 Courts of General Jurisdiction have 8. No fact necessary to confer Jurisdiction upon these Inferior Courts will be presumed, but every thing must appear upon the R ecord. Clark v. Nor ton, 6 Minn. 412 ((311. 277) (1861). But see, Illinois: Renney v.

Pleas to the Jurisdiction of the Court were either one of Two Descriptions: first, that the person of the Party making the Plea was not subject to the Court’s Jurisdiction; sec ond, that the Cause of Action was not subject to the Court’s Jurisdiction. 8 These will now be discussed. (I) Plea that the Court Has No Jurisdic tion Over the Party Defendant. — Pleas of this character were limited in number, and frequently consisted in a right of the defend ant to be exempted from lia bility to be sued in the Specific Court, as he was privileged to be exclusively sued in some other Court. The conclusion of such Pleas indicates that they should be Classed with Pleas to the Ju risdiction, but some authorities have Classed them with Pleas in Abatement to the person of the defendant t ° According to Martin, “Pleas challenging the right of the plaintiff to sue on account of any disability are not properly classed with Pleas to the Jurisdic “ but more properly belong to a cer tain Class of Pleas in Abatement yet to be considered.

Only Half De fenses were required,’ 8 Formal Commence ments were omitted,’° and such Pleas were concluded to the Cognizance of the Court by Praying Judgment, if the Court would take further Cognizance of the Action. 2 ° Pleas to the Jurisdiction, except such as de - nied Jurisdiction over the Subject - Matter of the Action under any ci rcumstances, were required to be Pleaded first in order, for if the Pleader raises any other question which the Court must of necessity pass upon, he admits the Jurisdiction, and cannot after wards be heard to deny it. 2 ’ This does not apply, of course, whe re the Court has No Ju - risdiction of the Subject - Matter. In such a ease, it cannot acquire Jurisdiction either by consent or waiver, and the objection of Want of Jurisdiction may be raised at any time. 22 If the Action was brought in a Court of Limited Juri sdiction, every Fact essential to sustain the Jurisdiction had to be stated in the Declaration; it would not be aided by presumptions. 23 13. 1 Chitty, On Pleading, e.

The Distinction Between Pleas to the Juris diction and Pleas in Abatement ACCORDING to Martin, Pleas to the Ju risdiction differed from Pleas in Abatement, in the following respects: First, in being always Pleaded in Person; second, in always requiring Half Defense, while some Pleas in Abatement were said to be good with Full Defense; and Tlvh’d, in Fraying Judgment, if the Court will take further Cognizance of the Action. In other respects, says Martin, in that they - abated the Writ or Action, they were essen tially the same. 27 Some authorities have classed Pleas to the Jurisdiction with Pleas in Abatement, while others have treated them under both heads.

Matters in Abate ment include: (I) Wrong Venue or Place of Trial; (II) The Personal Disability of one of the Parties to sue or be sued; (lii) That the Action is Prematurely Brought; (IV) The Pendency of Another Action for the sante cause; (V) Misnomer; (Vi) Nonjoinder or Misjoinder of Parties. The Situation Which Called for the Use of five Plea in Abatement WHERE a defendant, on examinat ion of. the plaintiff’s Declaration, perceives no ground for objecting to the"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"Page 438 of 735 Jurisdiction of the Court, but finds that matters exist by reason of which, though the Cause of Action is not affected, the present Suit cannot be maintained, he should Plead in Abatement. 3 ° Definition and Effect PLEAS in Abatement are variously de fined, depending upon their respective Classi fications, but, broadly speaking, include all such Pleas as seek to defeat a Specific Ac .tion, yet merely delay or prevent the en - .forcement of the Right of Action. By way of contrast, Pleas in Bar seek to bring about 29. A Plea In Abatement has been defined by Martin as follows: “By a Plea In Abatement the defendant shows Matter to the Court why be should not be Impleaded or Sued; or if Impleaded, not in the man ner and form employed by the plaintiff; and pray ing that the Writ or Plaint may Abate.” Martin, Cis’Il Proeednre at Oommon Law, c, X, Defences by Way of Dilatory Pleas, Art.

As to the nature and effect of, and the necessity for, Pleas In Abatement, see Pltts Sons 1Mg. Co. v. Commercial flat, Bank, 121 111, 582, 13 N.E. 156 (18S7). a Final Judgment on the merits on the Right of Action. If sustained, the effect of a Plea in Abate ment is not to dispose of the Right of Action, either entirely, nor even as far as the Par ticular Court is concerned, as is the case with a Plea to the Jurisdiction; nor, on the other hand, is it merely to temporarily Sus pend the Action, as is the case with a Plea in Suspension; but its effect, as observed above, is to defeat entirely that Particular Action, leaving the plaintiff free, however, to a ssert his Right of Action in Another Suit, and in the Same Court. It is some times said that the Plea merely tends to de lay the Action, but this is inaccurate. It en tirely defeats the Particular Action, but it merely delays the enforcement of the Rig/vt of Action, which, thereafter, may again be prosecuted, avoiding the Defect which led to the demise of the Particular Original Ac tion. Classification of Pleas in Abatement IN any event the Writ, on which the plain tiff’s Cause of Action was grounded, was Abatable by a Plea formally attacking its suffiCiency, or by a Plea to the Person suing or to the Person sued, showing that No Writ should have been issued in favor of the plain tiff or against the defendant. In accord ance with this broad view, Picas in A bate ment were classified as follows: First, Pleas relating to the Writ, as to the Form of It and to the Action of It; ~ Second, Pleas relating to the Count or Dec Jaration; Third, Pleas relating either to the Disabil ity of the Person of the Plaintiff or the Per son of the Defendant. 31. 1 Chitty, Oa Pleading, c. VI, Of Pleas to the Ju risdiction, and In Abatement, and the Proceedings Thereon, 450 — 454 (13th Am. ed., Springfield, 1859); I Saunders, The Law of Pleading & Evidence, in Clvii Aetloas, 2 (Ph Iladelphia, 1831). See. 206 PLEAS — DILATORY 417 If ground for Abating the Action Appears on the Face of the Declaration or Record, a Plea in Abatement is not necessary, for the objection may be raised by Demurrer or Motion to Quash; but if the matter does not so Appear, and Extrinsic Facts are neces sary to be shown, a Plea in Abatement is essential. 32 (I) Pleas in Abatement to the Original Writ or Eill. — According to Stephen, 23 a Plea in Abatement of the Writ was one which showed some ground for Abating or Quash ing the Original Writ, and made a Prayer to that effect. Any Matters of Fact tending to impeach the correctness of the Original Writ, that is, to show that it was imprope rly fram - ed or sued out, without, at the same time, tending to deny the Right of Action itself, constituted sufficient ground for Abating the Writ. Such a Plea might be as to the Form of the Writ or to the Action of it."},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"Page 439 of 735 Thus, for example, if there was a V ari ance between the Charge contained in the Original Writ and the Charge appearing in the Declaration, that discrepancy showed that the Original Writ was not properly adapted to the Action, and it was, therefore, a ground for Abatement. And where the Wri t appeared to have been sued out pending another Action al ready brought for the Same Cause, if it nam 32. Thus, any defect in the Writ, its service or re turn, which is apparent from an Inspection of the Record, may properly be taken advantage of by Mot ion; but where the Objection is founded upon extrinsic facts, or outside of the record, as that the defendant was exempt from service, the Matter must be Pleaded in Abatement, so that an Issue may be made thereon, and tried, if desired, by a Jury, like any other Issue of Fact.

C. 1893). ed only one person as the defendant, when it should have named several, or if it ap peared to have been defaced in a material part, it was Abatable. The objection that there was a Variance between the Original Writ and the Declara tion was conditioned upon obtaining Oyer of the Writ. This Form of Objection, however, came into question when, during the reigns of Ge orge II (1727 — 1760) and George III (1760 — 1820), the Courts of Common Pleas and King’s Bench adopted a Ru]e under which Oyer of the Original Writ was denied. The practical effect of this was to abolish Pleas in Abatement grounded on a Variance between the O riginal Writ and the Declara tion. 31 All other Pleas in Abatement, which could not be Verified without benefit of Oyer of the Original Writ, were also necessarily abolished, 35 but this Rule had no application to Actions Commenced by Bill. After this devel opment, Pleas of this char acter, according to Chitty, were termed Pleas in Abatement rather from their effect upon the Writ than from any direct attack upon it, as under the early Common Law Rule. 3~ Martin points out that where the Declaration, which was presumed to correspond with the Original Writ, was incorrect as to some Extrinsic Matter, it then became possible for the defendant to Plead in Abatement to the Writ through the medium of the Declara tion. 37 As to the Form of the Writ, Pleas in Abate ment were grounded principally on Misnom 34.

Under the early Common Law, many matters might be Pleaded in Abatement of the Count or Declaration in Actions begun by an Orig inal Writ. The basis of Pleas of this char acter was principally some Defect, Informali ty or Mistake appearing in the Recital of the Writ in the Declaration, which was deemed essential in all cases, or upon a Variance be tween the Writ as recited and the Count or Declaration, Such Pleas, therefore, although they were primarily directed against the Count or Declaration, and were denominated as Plea s to the Count or Declaration, indirect ly referred to the Original Writ as recited therein. 41 3$.

Ibid. 41 On a Plea in Abatement on the Ground of a Vari ance between the summons, which, in our country, took the place of the Origin al Writ, and the Decla ration, see; Illinois: Snell V. Stanley, 63 Ill. 891 (1872); West VIrginia: Anderson v. LewIs, 64 W. Va. 297, 61 S,E. 160 (1908). In 1654 the Court of Common Pleas adopt ed a Rule of Court, ordering that Declara tions in Actions on t he Case, and upon Gen eral Statutes, except for Debt, should no longer recite the Original Writ, but only the Nature of the Action. 42 As a result of this development, Pleas in Abatement founded on what appeared only in the recital in the Writ, were abolish ed. The objection of a variance between the Writ and the Declara tion could not thereafter be taken advantage of except by obtaining Oyer of the Original Writ. 43 And when, by later Rule of Court, Oyer of the Original Writ was denied, Pleas in Abatement on the ground of a Variance between the Original Writ and the Count or Declaration, disappeared. But for some time thereafter, it was possible to plead in Abate ment to the Writ through the medium of the DeclarationA 4 (Ill) Picas in Abatement to the Disability of the Person of the Plaintiff. — A Plea in Abatement to the Disability of the Person of the plaintiff or defendant was one which showed some personal legal disability in one of the Two Parties t o Sue or Be Sued. 45 As to the plaintiff, such Pleas originally largely consisted of Pleas denying the existence of the plaintiff as a Person, setting up his Dis ability to Sue by reason of his being an alien in amity, or in enmity, his outlawry upon Mesne or Final Process, his Attainder for Felony or Treason, his Infancy when appear ing otherwise than by Guardian or Next 42.

This was also true in Debt, when the infant was Sued as heir on the Specialty or Sealed Obligation of his ancestor, in which case it was held that the Parol might Demur, that is, that the Plea dings might be Stayed until he had at tained his full age. 49 Such right, however, never extended to an infant devisee, and in the year 1830, it was completely abolished by Section 10 of Chapter 47 of the Statute of 1 Wm.

Finally, with respect to these Pleas to the Person, it should be observed that they do not fall strictly within the Scope of Pleas in Abatement, for they do not Pray “that the Writ be Quashed,” but Pray Judgment “if 45.

As stated before, the effect of all Pleas in Abatement, if successful, is that the Particu lar Action is defeated, but the Right of Ac tion itself is not gone; and the plaintiff, on obtaining a Better Form of Writ, may main tain a New Action, if the Objection was Grounded on Matter of Abatement; or, if the Objection were to the Disab ility of the Person, he may bring a New Action when that disability is removed, according to Stephen. 5 ° FORM OF PLEA IN ABATEMENT — ANOTUER ACTION PErqinwG THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY The October Term, AD. 1926 AS. vs. C.D.

XXVII, Of Pleas to the Ju risdiction and Pleas in Abatement, 580 (1st Am. ed, Philadelphia, 1807). 422 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS CIt. 21 AT Common Law there appears to have been some doubt as to the correct method for placing in Issue the Corporate Existence of the Plaintiff. Thus, in the case of Boston Type c~ Stereotype Foundry v. Spooner, °~ in which the plaintiff brought an Action of Assumpsit, but made no Allegation as to its Incorporation, the defendant Pleaded in Abatement that there never was a person in being called or known by name of Boston Type & Stereotype Foundry, to which the plaintiff interposed a Demurrer, upon which a Judgment of Respondeat Ouster was ren dered . The defendant Excepted and the Is sue presented was whether the facts set forth in the Plea were the proper subject of a Plea in Abatement. Before answering this Issue, a few prelim inary observations may be helpful. The de fendant should not be compell ed to answer an Action unless it prosecuted in the name of a person, either Artificial or Natural, against whom he may have a Judgment, and an Execution. But how is he to Plead to bring this end about? As a General Rule, Matter in Bar cannot be Pleaded in Abate ment, but to this Rule there are exceptions. Thus, the Nonjoinder of a Party Plaintiff may be Pleaded in Abatement, or taken ad vantage of under a Plea of the General Is sue, which is a Plea in Bar; in Replevin, the defendant may Plead property in hi mself or a stranger, either in Abatement or in Bar; and certain personal disabilities which en tirely defeat the Suit may be Pleaded in Abatement or in Bar, such as Alien Enemy, Attainder, Felony and Outlawry. So, in the instant ease, it appears that the defendant’s effort to reach a Lack of the Corporate Existence of the plaintiff was a proper subject for either a Plea in Abate ment or Bar; that is, the Plea might be di rected to the disability of a plaintiff, denying ~3. 5 Vt. 93 (1823). See, In this co nnection, Comment, Pleading — Necessity to Plead Corporate Capacity, 22 MI chij,Rev. 175 (1923). his existence, showing that there was no such person in rerum natura, as that at the Commencement of the Suit he was a Ficti tious Person, 64 or he may have Plead ed the Same Matter in Bar. 05 It follows, therefore, that the position of the Counsel for the plain tiff in the instant case, that the defendant could only avail himself of this Defense by Plea in Bar, is erroneous. And the objec tion that the defendant cou ld not give a Bet ter Writ is met by the fact that the Rule re quiring the defendant to give the plaintiff a Better Writ has no application where a plaintiff, as in this case, cannot have a Better Writ, as there was no such person in exist ence. Notwithst anding the above observations, there are two views as to whether the Corpo rate Existence of a Corporation was in Issue under a Plea of the General Issue. The gen erally accepted view was that the Existence of"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Page 445 of 735 the Corporation was not put in issue by a Plea of the General Issue. This appears to be the better view, as the function of the General Issue was to deny Material Allega tions of Fact in the plaintiff’s Declaration. If the Corporate Existence of the plaintiff were put in Issue the General Issue would be placing in Issue a Question of Law, as the Corporate Existence of the plaintiff can only be determined by construing the Charter of Incorporation, and Construction of a written document involves a Question of Law. The General Issue alone, therefore, sho uld operate as an admission of the Cor porate Existence of the plaintiff; 66 if it 64. 1 Chitty, On Pheading, e. fl Of Pleas to the Ju risdiction, and in Abatement, and the Proceedings Thereon, 435 - 436 (12th Am. ed., Springfield, 1859~ New York: Doe v, Penfiehl, 19 Johns.

Corporation. 67 And the same principles operate where a defendant Pleads the General Issue to an Ac tion brought by an Executor,°~ the Authority of the Plaintiff being admitted by the Plea.°° As we have seen all Matter of a Dilatory Character must be Pleaded before entering a Plea in Bar, and by a separate Plea limited to the purpose or delaying the Action. Nor was it possible to Plead to the Jurisdiction or in Abatement while Pleading in Bar, or in any manner affecting the Merits of the Cause. 7 ° And, of course, as may be seen from a glance at the chart on the General Order in which Pleas may be Pleaded, it is clear that any Plea, which contains Matter in Bar of the Action, constitutes a Waiver of all Objections to the Jurisdiction of the Court and to the Manner of Framing the Action. 7 ’ Thus, a Plea of the General Issue, as we observed in discussing how the Cor - porate Existence of a Corporation might be placed in Jssue, admits the competency of that the plaintiff is a corporation is a Plea in Bar, hut a Plea denying that the defendant is a cor poration is a Plea in Abatement. 67.

Non joinder of Plaintiffs in Tort Gives Rise to a Plea in Abatement THE proper plaintiffs in a tort Action for injuries to property are MI the Joint Own ers; but where the remedy seeks the recovery of Damages, and not the Speeiflc Thing, the Nonjoinder of one or more of the Joint Owners can only be taken advantage of to defeat the Action by Plea of Abatement.” If a Plea in Abatement is not interposed to prevent the severance of the Joint Cause of Action in Tort, the plaintiff may recover according to his proportionate interest in the property, and the other Joint Owners Not Joined may afterwards sue and recover their proportion of the whole Damages.° 4 Misjoinder of Plaintiffs in Tort A Misjoinder of plaintiffs in Tort, as well as in Contract, is ground for Nonsuit on the Trial, 05 It has been held that married women must sue alone for personal injuries.

Nonjoinder or Misjoinder of Defendants in Tort A Nonjoinder or Misjoinder of Joint Tort feasors as Defendants is no error, “Several persons acting independently, but causing to gether a single injury, may be Sued either Jointly or Severally) and the injure d party may, at his Election, sue any of them Sepa rately, or he may sue All or Any Number of them Jointly. If he sues all, he may, at any time before Judgment, dismiss as to either or any of the defendants, and proceed as to the others”.° 7 The legal natu re of a Tort is such that it may generally be treated as either Joint or Several, and all the wrongdoers are lia ble individually and collectively for the con sequences of their acts, and all may be sued Jointly, or Any Number Less Than the Whole, or each may be sued Separately. Each is liable for himself, as the entire Dam age sustained was thus occasioned, each sanctioning the acts of the others, so that, by suing one alone, he is not charged beyond his just proportion. It seems, however, that No Joint Ac tion can be maintained for a Joint Slander, though it is difficult to see, upon principle, why one uniting with another in an agreement that the slanderous words should be spoken should not be as much liable as any one of several trespassers where the actu al blow was given by one alone.

CIt 21 Misnomer in the Christian name of the de fendant be Pleaded in Abatement, the de fendant must in such Plea show what his true Christian name is, This requirement of this Rule has often been made the test by which to distinguish whether a given matter sho uld be Pleaded in Abatement or in Bar, The lattcr Plea, as impugning the Right of Action altogether, can, of course, give No Better Writ, as its effect is to deny that, under any Form of Writ, the plaintiff should recover in such Action. If, therefore, a B et ter Writ can be given, it shows that the Plea should be in Abatement, and not in Bar, Matter in Abatement must be set up by Plea in Abatement, and not by a Plea in Bar. In other words, whenever the subject - matter to be Pleaded is to the effect that the plain tiff cannot maintain Any Action at any time, it must be Pleaded in Bar; but matter which merely defeats the Present Action, and does not show that the plaintiff is forever con cluded, must be Pleaded in Abatement. Mat ter in Abatement set up in a Pl ea in Bar can not be considered in Abatement. 5 In an Action on a Promissory Note the defendant Pleaded in Bar, not denying that he owed the note, but suggesting that it was not yet due.

A Plea in Suspension of the Action is one which shows some Ground for Not Pro ceeding in the Suit at the present time, and Prays that the Pleading may be Stayed until that Ground be Removed. THESE Fleas were limited in number, in cluding such Pleas as Outlawry or Alien En mity of the plaintif f, arising after the insti tution of the Su!t. 4 The effect of this Plea is not to abate or defeat the Writ or Action, but merely to postpone or Suspend the Ac tion. This characteristic is responsible for the Classification of such Pleas as distinct from Pl eas in Abatement. When the Ground for Not Proceeding with the Action is re moved, the plaintiff is permitted to go on with it, without the necessity of bringing a New Action. Where an infant heir was Sued on a Spe cialty Debt of his deceased ancestor, he Pleaded his Nonage, not as a Ear or Defense, but merely in Suspension of the Proceed ings until he should arrive at full age, where upon the plaintiff could proceed with his Action. This was called a “Parol Demurrer,” the meaning of which was that the Plea ding should be Stayed. 5 By the Section 10 of Chapter 47 of the Statute of 1 Wm. IV, 70 Statutes at Large 295 (1830), the Parol De murrer was abolished. 3. Pitts Sons’ 111g. Co. v. Commercial Nat.

Aid - Prayer and the Excommunication of the Plaintiff were subjects for Pleas in Sus pension, but since the number of such Pleas was small and the Suspension of the Action was similar to an Abatement of the Suit un til some future time or event, such distinc tion has n ot always served to distinguish them from Pleas in Abatement. 6 In Massachusetts, it was held that a Plea that the plaintiff is an Alien Enemy, though it may be either in Abatement or in Bar in a Reai Action, is merely in Suspension in a Personal Action, a s it sets up merely a tem porary disability of the plaintiff, which ceases with the war. Said the Court in the Mas sachusetts Case, “It is still called a Plea in Abatement, although the effect of it is not to Abate the Writ, or defeat the Process entirely, but to Suspend It; and the Plea is defective, when it concludes either in Bar or in Abatement of the Writ. The Form is a Prayer, whether the plaintiff shall be Further Answered; and the Judgment to be Entered upon it, when it shall be Con fessed or Mainta ined, is, that the Writ afore said remain without day, donec terrac fuerint communes, until the intercourse or peace of the two countries shall be restored. Where the effect of a Plea is a temporary disability of the plaintiff, and nothing more, a Prayer o f Judgment of the Writ is bad.” FORM OF PLEA IN SuSPENSIoN — PAROL DEMURRER"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"Page 453 of 735 THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY The October Term, A.D. 1926 A.B. vs. C.D. 6 - Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, c.

XVI, Dilatory Pleas, § 232 Forms of Pleas in Abatement, 402 (3d ed. by Ballantine, St. Paul, 1923). JUDGMENT ON DILATORY PLEAS 212. if a Demurrer is sustained to a Plea to the Jurisdiction or to a Plea in Abatement, the Judgment is Respondeat Ouster, and the defendant may Plead to the Action, If an Issue of Fact is joined, and the Jury find against the defendant, they assess damages for the plaintiff. If an Issue either of L aw or Fact, upon a Plea in Abatement, is found for the defendant, the Judgment is that the Writ be Quashed. WHERE a Plea to the Jurisdiction or a Plea in Abatement is found in favor of the defendant upon either an Issue of Fact or Law, the Judgment was th at the Writ or Bill, as the case might be, should be Abated or Quashed. If the Plaintiff prevailed upon a Demurrer to the Plea, the Judgment was Interlocutory in Character, that is, Respon deat Ouster, or let the defendant answer over. Where an Issue of Fa ct was joined, and it was found in favor of the plaintiff, that is, that the defendant’s Plea was false, a Final Judgment was immediately awarded in his favor on the merits. 8 The purpose of this Rule, obviously, was to discourage False Dilatory Pleas, and ft made it possible for the plaintiff in this single instance to Win on the Merits, without a Trial of the Issues raised in the Declaration. In no other in stance may a party Win on the Merits on a Dilatory Plea? FORMAL COMMENCEMENT AND CONCLUSION 213. Dilatory Pleas must be Framed with Great Strictness and with a Formal Conclu sion.

The Practice of the Court of King’s Bench in Personal Actions, e. XXVII, Of Pleas to the Juris diction and Pleas in Abatement, 58& — 580 (Ithiladel phia, 1807), contains a discussioa of Judgments on a Plea in Abatement See !t13’eI’s & Waterson v. Hunter Erwin & co,, 20 Ohio 382, 387 (1851), note: ‘I. The Judgment on a Plea in Abatement is either (1) that the Writ or Deeiaratioa he quashed (caneter breve, 0i nO,r&t/o) (2) Ilespondeat Ouster; and (3) Final (quod ,‘ecupcr et), Judgment is rendered either (1) without Issue taken on the Plea; or (2) With Issue. Jssi,os are either (1) Issues in Law or (2) I ssues in Fact. II. Issues on Pleas in Abateme]lt are eIther (I) such as must be tried by the Court; OF (2~ such as may be tried either by the Court or Jury. The kind or form of Judgment, rendered on n~, Issue up on a Plea In Abatement, depends upon the que stion whether the Issue ho found (1) for the plaintiff, and against the Plea; or (2) for the defe,,dant, and In Favor of the Pica.” Sec. 213 PLEAS — DILATORY 431 advantage or relief sought — determines its character. “It would be both illogical and absurd, in a Plea in Bar, to Pray, as in a Plea in Abatement to the Count or Declaration, ‘Judgment of the said Writ and Declaration, and that the same may be Quashed’ ; and, as only the relief asked can be awarded, a mis take in this regard is fatal to the Plea. And hence the Rule that a Plea beginning in Bar and ending in Abatement is in Abatement, and, though beginning in Abatement and ending in Bar, is in Bar; so a Plea beginning and ending in Abatement is in Abatement, though its Subject - Matter be in Bar, and a P lea beginning and ending in Bar is in Bar, though its Subject - Matter is in Abatement. (Comyns’ Digest, title “Abatement”, b. 2.) With respect to all Dilatory Pleas, the Rule requiring them to be framed with the ut most strictness and exactness is founded i n wisdom. It says to the defendant: ‘If you will not address yourself to the justness and merits of the plaintiff’s demand, and appeal to the Forms of Law, you shall be judged by the Strict Letter of the Law.’ And so it has been held that a Plea in Abateme nt conclud ing, ‘wherefore he Prays Judgment if the said plaintiff ought to have or maintain his aforesaid Action against him,’ etc. (a Con clusion in Bar), is bad.” 10 Pleas in Bar do not require the same de gree of certainty as a Plea in Abatement, for being addressed to the justness of the plain tiff’s claim, they are favored by the Courts. Certainty to a common intent, therefore, is all that is required. A Plea in Abatement containing a wrong Prayer is bad, but it has been held that the Conclusion or Prayer of a Plea in Bar is not material; that “there is a distinction between a Plea in Bar and a Plea in Abatement, — in the former the Party 10.

D. Prays Judgment if the Court will or ought to have further Cognizance of the Suit; “‘3 or, in some cases, the defendant Prays Judgment “ whether lie ought to be compelled to answer”.’ 4 A Plea in Suspension seems also to be in general Pleaded without a Formal Com mencement. Its Conclusion, in the case of a Plea of Nonage, is that the Parol shall De mur, or the proceedings be stayed, until the defendant comes of Full Age.’ 5 A Plea in Abatement founded on matter extrinsic to the Writ is also usually Plead - ‘‘Atwood v.

In some states Pleas in Abatement have been abolished, and defects formerly avail able on such a Plea are reached either by a Motion or by an Answer in the Nature of a Plea in Abatement. In England AT Common Law there was no require ment as to Verification of either Pleas to the Jurisdiction or Pleas in Abatement. But the Statute of 4 A nne, c. 16, § 11, 11 Statutes at Large 157 (1705) provided that “no Dilatory Plea shall be received in any Court of Record, unless the Party offering such Plea, do, by Affidavit,’ 9 prove the truth thereof, or show some probable matter to the Court to induc e them to believe that the Fact of such Dilatory Plea is true.” The Affidavit as to Truth required by this Stat ute might be made by the defendant himself, or by a third person; and as the Statute re quired only probable cause, there was no necessity for a n Affidavit, where the Plea was for Matter Apparent. And in 1SS3, by the Statute of 3 & 4 Wm. lv, c. 42, § 8, 73 Statutes at Large 275, it was provided that no Plea in Abatement for 16. Foxwist v. Tremaine, 2 Wins.

ThE GENERAL NATURE OF PLEAS IN BAR 215. If the Declaration is sufficient both in Substance and in Form, so that neither a Dila tory Plea nor a Demurrer will lie, the defendant must Plead in Bar, and his Pleading must be either: (I) By Way of Traverse (II ) By Way of Confession and Avoid - ance (III) By Way of Estoppel Methods of Pleading in Bar ASSUMING that the plaintiff has stated a good Cause of Action in his Declaration, and the defendant desires neither to avail him self of any of the Dilatory Pleas, n or to De rnur, he must interpose a Plea in Ear, which nay be any one of Three Forms of Plea: First, he may meet the plaintiff’s alleged Cause of Action by Traversing or Denying some or all of the Material Allegations of Fact stated in the Declaration; this he might do by Pleading the General Issue, which generally denied all the Material Alle gations in the plaintiff’s alleged Cause of Ac tion; he might plead a Common or Specific Traverse, which was a Denial of a Material Fact in the pleader’s own langu age; or he might plead a Special Traverse, which was an Indirect Denial of a Material Allegation; Sec ond, he may meet the plaintiff’s Declaration by admitting the Truth of the Facts stated therein, arid then alleging a new combination of Facts or Events, to which a Rule of Sub stantive Law attaches the consequence of Non - Liability; such a Plea, known as a Plea in Confession and Avoidance, might be either in Discharge or in Justification and Excuse; Third, the defendant, without either A dmit ting or Denying the Facts alleged, may set up New Facts which operate to prevent the plaintiff from sustaining the Allegations Sec. 216"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"Page 458 of 735 PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 435 contained in the plaintiff’s Declaration. Thus, to summarize, the defendant may meet an Alleged Cause in a Declaration by Plead ing One of Three Forms of Traverse; by Pleading in Confession and Avoidance in Justification, in Excuse, or in Discharge; or by Pleading by Way of Estoppel. Special Pleas — The Different Varieties PLEAS other than General Issues are or dinarily distinguished from them by the name of Special Pleas; and when resort is had to these a Party is said to Plead Special ly, as contrasted with Pleading the General Issue. The Issues produced upon Special Pleas, as being usual ly more specific and par ticular than those of Not Guilty, etc., are sometimes described as Special Issues, as con trasted with what were called General Issues; the latter term having been afterward ap plied, not only to the Issues, but to the Pleas which tendered and produced them. Thus, instead of Pleading the General Issue, the de fendant, in certain cases, may effectually an swer the Declaration by interposing a Spe cial Plea which creates a Specific Issue. Such an Issue was raised by a Common or Specif ic Traverse denying some one Material Allegation in the Declaration upon which the Right of Action depends. Many Special Pleas in Bar, however, Admit the Truth of the Plaintiff’s Allegations, but allege New or Affirmative Matter in avoidance of their legal operation.. One type of Special Flea, alleging Matter of Estoppel, neither con fess es nor denies the truth of the Declaration, though like other Pleas in Bar, It sets up Matter which defeats the Right of Action. Recoupment and Set - Off assert cross - de ?na nds due from the plaintiff to the defend ant. It Is generally improper to set up a De fense by a Special Plea which can be shown under the General Issua But in many eases the defendant may be at liberty to show spe daily to the Court matters of defense, n ot merely consisting in a denial, but introduc tory of new matter, such as coverture or in fancy. Although these may be admissible under the General Issue, yet being matter of justification or excuse, it is convenient to set forth the particular facts reli ed on as a defense in a Special Plea, which will apprise the Court and the adverse party of the cir - cumstances and nature of the defense, and keep the Facts and the Law distinct. Pleas which set up no new affirmative matter, but which merely set up eviden tial facts inconsistent with the plaintiff’s prima facie case, are said to be argumentative de nials and improper. But there is a peculiar species of plea, known as a Special Traverse, which is an exception to the rule. THE VARIOUS FORMS OF TRAVERSE OR DE NIAL 216. The different Forms of Traverse or Denial may be classified as: (I) The Specific or Common Traverse (Il) The Special Traverse (III) The General Traverse, including (A) The General Issue (B) The Replication De Injuria A Traverse concludes with a Tender of Issue. AS previously pointed out, Pleas are of Two General Classes, viz., Dilatory Pleas; and Peremptory Pleas, or Pleas in Bar. Pleas in Bar are said to be either in Denial, that is, by Way of Traverse — or by Way of Con fession and Avoidance of the Action — or by Way of Estoppel. It will be seen, how ever, that under the General Issue, Defenses may sometimes be raised of the sort raised by a Plea in Confession and Avoidance, as well as those raised by a Traverse. And of Tra verses there are four sorts: First, the Specific or Common Traverse; Second, the Special Traverse; Third, the General Trav erse, which includes the General Issue and the Replication Dc Injuria. The latter form of the General Traverse will be discussed in the next Chapter, Where an Ailegation is Traversed or De nied, it is evident that a question is at once raised between the Parties; and it is a Ques tion of Fact, namely, whether the facts in the Declaration or other Pleading, as the case may be, which the Traverse denies, are true. A question being thus raised, or in other words, the Parties having arrived at a specific point, where matter was affirmed on one side and denied on the other, the par ty interposing the Traverse is generally obliged to offer or refer this question to some Mode of Trial, or as it is said, to Tender Is sue. This he does by annexing to the Tra verse an appropriate formula, as for in stance: “And of this he puts himself upon the"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"Page 459 of 735 country,” thus proposing a Trial by the country — that i s, by a Jury. If the Tender of Issue be accepted by the other Party, the Parties were at issue on a Question of Fact, and the question itself was called the “Is sue.” A Tender of an Issue of Fact was and is accepted by what is called a “Joinder in Issue,” or “Similiter,” which consisted of a Form which read thus: “And the said A, as to the Plea of the said B, above Pleaded, and whereof he has put himself upon the country, doth the like.” As we have seen, the Tender of an Issue in Law, by Demurrer, is necessarily accepted by the other Party, but this is not true of the Tender of an Issue in Fact. An Issue of Fact need not necessarily be accepted, for the oth er Party may consider the Traver se itself as insufficient in Law. A Traverse, for in stance, may, in denying a part only of the Declaration, be so framed as to involve a part that is immaterial or insufficient to de cide the action, or the Traverse may be deemed defective in Point of For m, and the other party may object to its Sufficiency in Law on that ground. He, therefore, has a right to Demur to the Traverse as Insuffi cient in Law, instead of joining in the Issue Tendered. Ch. 22 With this general statement in mind, the general rule s relating to the Traverse may be considered, and then various Forms of Traverse may be considered in order. THE GENERAL REQUISITES OF TRAVERSE 217. The following General Rules apply to the Traverse, without regard to whether, in Form, it is Common, Gene ral, or Special: (I) The Traverse should generally deny the Opposing Allegation in the Manner and Form in which it is made (modo et forma; i. e. 9xt Manner and Form as alleged”); thus putting the opposite Party to Proof in Manner and Form, as well as in ge neral effect. (II) A Traverse may be taken upon a Mixed Allegation of Law and Fact, but not upon Matter of Law alone, nor upon matter not alleged. Upon Matter of Fact it must be where the Fact iseither Expressly Alleged, or Necessarily Implied from what is alleged. (III) The Traverse must not involve an Estoppel against the Party Plead ing it. THE different kinds or Forms of Traverse having been previously explained, we shall here take up certain Rules as to the Manner of Pleading Denials. Form of Denial IT is customary in a Traverse to deny the Allegation in the Manner and Form in which it is made, and therefore to put the opposite party to prove it to be true in Manner and Form, as well as in general effect. Accord ingly, he is often exposed at the Tria l to the danger of a Variance by a slight deviation in his evidence from his Allegation. This doc trine of Variance, says Stephen, is founded on the strict quality of the Traverse here stated.’ This strictness is so far modified 436 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS 1. Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading In Civil Actions, ~. II, Of the Principal Rules of PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR Sec. 217 that it is, in general, sufficient to prove ac curately the substance of the Allegation, and a deviation in point of mere Form or in Mat ter quite Immaterial will be disregarded. The general principle is that the Traverse brings the fact into question, according to the Manner and Form in which it is alleged, and that the opposite Party must conse quently prove that, in Substance at least, the Allegation is accurately true. The existence of this principle is indicated by the wording of a Traverse, which, when in the negative, generally denies the last pleading mode et forma [in Manner and Form as al leged]. This will be found to be the case in almost all Traverses, except the General Issue Non Fist Factum, and the Replication d € injuria. These words, however, though usual, are said to be in no case strictly essential, so as to render their omission ca use of Demurrer. 2"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"Page 460 of 735 It is naturally a consequence of the prin ciple here mentioned that great accuracy and precision in adapting the Allegation to the true state of the Fact are observed in all well - drawn Pleadings; the vigilance of the pleader being always directed to these quali ties, in order to prevent any risk of Variance or Failure of Proof at the Trial in the event of a Traverse by the Opposite Party. Traverse Not to be Taken on Matter of Law Alone. AGAIN, in respect to all Traverses, it is laid down as a Rule that a Traverse must not be taken upon Matter of Law? A Denial of Pleading, 219 (Edited by Williston, Cambridge, Mass., 1895). ~ Comyn, Digest, Pleader, 0. 1 (London 1522); Nevll and Cook’s Case, 2 Leon. 5, 74 Eng.Rep. 310 (1589). 3. Bonnet v.

Maddox, 16 48. 320, 117 Eng. 437 the Law involved in the precedent Pleading is, in other words, an exception to the suffi ciency of that Pleading in Point of Law, and is therefore within the scope and proper province of a Demurrer, and not of a Trav erse. Thus, where, to an Action of Trespass for fishing in plaintiff’s fishery, th e defendant Pleaded that the locus in quo was an arm of the sea, in which every subject of the rea]m had the liberty and privilege of free fishing, and the plaintiff, in his Replication, Trav ersed that in the said arm of the sea every subject of the realm had the liberty and privi lege of free nshing, this was he]d to be a Traverse of a mere Inference of Law - , and therefore bad.’ Upon the same principle, if a Matter be Alleged in Pleading, “by reason whereof” [virtute cujus] a certain legal in ference is d rawn, as that the plaintiff “be came seised,” etc, or the defendant “became liable,” etc., this vit’tute cujus is not Trav ersable, because, if it be intended to question the Facts from which the seisin or liability is deduced, the Traverse should be appli ed to the Facts, and to those Cnly; and, if the legal inference be doubted, the course is to De mur. Traverse May be Taken on Allegation of Law and Fact BUT, on the other hand, where an Allega tion is Mixed of Law and Fact, it may be Traversed.6 For example, in answer to an Bcp. 004 (255~ Russcll’s Case, I Dyer 2Gb, p1. 171, 73 Eng.Rep. 59 (1536); Grills v, Mannell, Wines 378, 125 Eng.Rep. 1223 (1742); New York: Fosliny V. fiche, 2 Hill (Nt) 24 7.

The defendant Pleaded that, after making the deed, he offered himself to mar ry the plaintiff, and she refused; absque hoc, “that he refused to take her for his wile be fore she had refu sed to take him for her husband.” The Court was of opinion that this Traverse was bad, because there had been no Allegation in the Declaration, “that the defendant had refused before the plaintiff had refused,” and therefore the Traverse went to deny what the plainff had not af firmed. 1 ’ The Plea in this case ought to have been in Confession and Avoidance; stating merely the Affirmative Matter, that before the plaintiff offered the defendant offered, and that the plaintiff had refused him, and omitting the abs que hoc. Again, in an Ac tion of Debt on Bond against the defendant, as Executrix of J. S., she Pleaded in Abate ment that J. S. died intestate, and that Ad ministration was granted to her. On Demur rer it was objected that she should have gone on to T raverse “that she meddled as Execu - trix before the Administration granted,” be cause, if she so meddled, she was properly charged as Executrix, notwithstanding the subscquent grant of Letters of Administra tion. But the Court held the Plea good in that res pect; and I - Jolt, C. J., said “that, if the defendant had taken such Traverse, it had made her Plea vicious, for it is enough for her to show that the plaintiff’s Writ ought to Abate, which she has done, in showing that she is chargeable only by another na me. Then as to the Traverse, that she did not Ad minister as Executrix before the Letters of Administration were granted, it would be to Traverse what is not Alleged in the plaintiff’s Declaration, which would be against a Rule of Law, that a man shall nev er Traverse that which the plaintiff has riot Alleged in his Declaration.” 12 ii.

Sec 215 PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 439 There is, however, the following Exception to this Rule, viz.: That a Traverse may be taken upon Matter which, though not Ex pressly Alleged, is Necessarily Implied.’~ Thus, in Replevin for taking cattle the de fendant made Cognizance that A was seised of the close in question, and, by his command, the defendant took the cattle damage feasant. The plaintiff Pleaded in Bar that he himself was seised of one - third part, and put in his cattle abs"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"Page 462 of 735 que hoc, “that the said A was sole seised.” On Demurrer, it was objected that this Trav erse was taken on Matter not Al - leged, the Allegation being that A was seised, not that .4 was sole seised. But the Court held that in the Allegation of Seisin that of Sole Seisin was Necessarily Implied, and that whatever is Necessarily Implied is Travers a ble, as much as if it were expressed. Judg ment for plaintiff.” The Court, however, ob served that in this case the plaintiff was not obliged to Traverse the Sole Seisin, and that the effect of merely Traversing the seisin Mocto et F’orma, as alleged, would have been the same on the Trial as that of Traversing the Sole Seisin. Traverse Involving Estoppcl A TRAVERSE must not involve an Estop pel against the Party using it. An illustra tion of this Rule appears in an Action on a Deed. A Party to a deed, who Traverses it, must plead Non Est Factum, and should not Plead that he did not grant, did not demise, etc.’ 5 This Rule seems to depend on the Doc trine of Estoppel. A man is sometimes pre cluded, in Law, from Alleging or Denying a Fact in consequence of his own previous act, i~ Rex v. Kilderhy, I Wms.Saund. 311, 3124, n. 4, 85 Eng.Bep. 428, 433 (1669); GIlbert v. Parker, 2 Salk, 629, 91 Eng.Rep. 532 (1704); Meriton V. Briggs, 1 Ld. Ray m. 39, 91 Fng,Rep. 922 (1695). 14. Gilbert v.

Rep. 1084 (1810). allegation, or denial to the contrary, a nd this preclusion is called an “Estoppel.” It may arise either from Matter of Record, from the Deed of the Party, or from Matter in Pais; that is, Matter of Fact. It is from this Doctrine of Estoppel, ap parently, that the Rule as to the mode of Traversi ng deeds has resulted, for though a Party against whom the deed is alleged may be allowed, consistently with the Doctrine of Estoppel, to say “Non Est Factum,” viz, that the deed is not his, he is, on the other hand, precluded by that doctrine from denying its effect or operation; because, if allowed to say “Non Concessft’ or “Non Demisit,” when the instrument purports to grant or to demise, he would be permitted to contradict his own deed. According]y, it will be found that in the case of a person not a Pa rty, but a Stranger, to the deed, the Rule is reversed, and the Form of Traverse in that case is “Non Concessit,” etc.; 16 the reason of which seems to be that Estoppels do not hold with respect to strangers. MATERIALITY OF TUE TRAVERSE 215. A Traverse must riot be taken on an Immaterial Allegation. This rule prohibits a Traverse; (I) On Matter that is Irrelevant or In sufficient in Law; (II) On Matter that is Prematurely al leged; (III) On Matter of Aggravation; (IV) On mere Matter of Inducement THIS rule prohibits a Pleader from Trav ersing on Matter that is either Irrelevant or Insufficient in Law.’ 7 Thus, in Debt for Rent 10.

So, where, to an Action of Trespass for Assault and Battery, the defendant Plea ded that a Judgment was recovered, and Execution issued thereupon against a third person, and that the plaintiff, to rescue that person’s goods from the Execu tion, assaulted the bailiffs, and that in aid of the Bailiffs, and by their command, the defendan t mollitsr mantis imposuit upon the plaintiff, to prevent his rescue of the goods, it was holden that a Traverse of the Command of the Bailiffs was bad; for, even without their Command, the defendant might lawfully interfere to prevent a rescue, which is a breach of the peace.’° The Rule also prohibits a Pleader from Traversing on Matter which, though not Im material to the case, is prematurely alleged. 2 ’ New York: Rogers v.

Thus, If, in Debt on Bond, the plaintiff should declare that, at the time of sealing and de livery, the defendant was of Full Age, the de fendant should not Traverse this, becau se it was not necessary to allege it in the Declara tion; though, if in fact he was a minor, this would be a good subject for a Plea of Infancy, to which the plaintiff might then well reply the same matter, viz, that he was Of Age. 2 ’ Again, this Rule proh ibits the taking of a Traverse on Matter of Aggravation; that is, matter which only tends to increase the amount of Damages, and does not concern the Right of Action itself. Thus, in Trespass for Chasing Sheep, per quod the sheep died, the dyIng of the she ep, being Aggravation only, is not Traversable.’ 3 And where Matter of Inducement is sb leged, which is not essential to the substance of the case, but only explanatory of the main Allegations, a Denial would be unriecessary.~ It is otherwise, however, when such matter is not merely explanatory. If essential, though in the Nature of Inducemen t, it may still be Traversed. 25 22. Sir Ralph llovy’s case, 1 Vent. 217, 86 Eng.Itep. 148 (1672). 23. Leech v. Widsley, I Vent. 54, 86 Eng.Rep. 38.

The plaintiff replied th at the Judgment was satisfied, but kept on foot by fraud sari covin. The defendants traversed that the Judg ment was satisfied, and this was considered a bad traverse, because to allege that it was satisfied was only Inducement to the Allegation that it wa s kept on foot by fraud and covin.

Where there are Several Allegations, all of which are Material, the Party may Traverse any one he pleases. TIlE Principle of this Rule is that where the case of any Party rests upon Sev eral Allegations, each of which is essential to its support, it may be as effectually destroyed by controverting one part as another. 2 ° Thus, in an Action of Trespass, if the defend ant Pleads that A was seised, and demised to him, a Traverse of either the Seisin or the Demise would be sufficient; as in either case, if maintained, it would be effectual to over come the Defense. 21 Again, in Trespass, if the defendant Pleads that A was Seized, and enfeoffed B, who enfeoffed C, who enfeoffed D, whose estate th e defendant bath, the plain tiff may Traverse whichever of the feoff ments he pleases. 28 Great care is necessary, however, in the selection of the Allegation to be thus denied, so as to oppose the one most open to objection; for, as we see in another place , those not expressly denied are taken as admitted. 2 ° lie was sworn before the Lord Mayor, and that the defendant said be was falsely sworn in that Oath, it was held that the plaintiff’s being sworn before the Lord Mayor, though in the nature of induce ment, was a traversable matter, being of the sub stance of the Action.

DENIAL OF THE ESSENTIALS ONLY 220. A Traverse must not be Too Large, nor, on the other hand, too Narrow. Qualification — A Material Allegation of Title or Estate may be Traversed as Alleged, though stated with unnecessary particularity. AS a Traverse must not be taken on an Im material Allegation, so, when applied to an Allegation that is Material, it should take in no more and no less of that A llegation than is necessary to raise a Material Issue. If it involves more than some essential proposi tion of operative fact, it is said to be too large; if less, too narrow. Traverse Too Large IN the first place, it must not be too large.m It may thus b e too large by involv ing in the Issue circumstances of time, place, quantity, etc., which are Immaterial to the Merits of the particular case, though forming part of the Allegation Traversed.

The plaintiff Replied that the bond was given for a just debt, and Traversed that the £1,500 was won by gaming in Manner and Form as alleged. On Demurrer it was ob ject ed that the Replication was ill, because it made the precise sum parcel of the Issue, and tended to oblige the defendant to prove that the whole sum of £1,500 was won by gaming; whereas the statute avoids the bond if any part of the consideration be on tha t account. The Court was of opinion that there was No Color to maintain the Replication; for that the Material Part of the Plea was that part of the money for which the bond was given was won by gaming, and that the words, “to wit, £1,500” were only Form, of which the Repli cation ought not to have taken any notice. 3 ’ So where the plaintiff Pleaded that the Queen, at a Manor Court, held on such a day by L S., her steward, and by copy of Court Roll, etc., granted certain land to the plain tiff’s lessor, and the defendant Rejoined, Traversing that the Queen, at a Manor Court, held such a day by I. S., her steward, granted the land to the lessor, the Court held that the Traverse was ill, “for the Jury are thereby bound to find a copy on such a day, and by such a steward, which ought not to be.” The Traverse, it seems, ought to have been that the Queen did not grant in Manner and Form as allege& 32 Again, a Traverse may be Too Large by being taken in the Conjunctive instead of the Disjunctive, where it is not Mat erial that the Allegation Traversed should be proved Con junctively. Thus, in an Action of Assumpsit the plaintiff declared on a policy of insurance, and averred “that the ship insured did not arrive in safety, but that the said ship, tackle, apparel, ordn ance, munition, artillery, boat, 3L Colborne v, Stoekdale, I Str. 493, 93 Eng.Rep. 655 (1721). U. Lane v. Alexander, Cro.Jac. 202, 79 Eng.Rep. 177 and other furniture were sunk and destroyed in the said voyage.” The defendant Pleaded with a Traverse: “ Without this, that the said ship, tackle, apparel, ordnance, munition, artillery, boat, and other furniture were sunk and destroyed in the voyage in Manner and Form as alleged.” Upon Demurrer this Traverse was adjudged to be bad, and it was held that the d efendant ought to have Denied Disjunctively that the ship or tackle, etc., was sunk, or destroyed, because in this Action for Damages the plaintiff would he entitled to recover compensation for any part of that which was the subject of insurance and had be en lost; whereas (it was said), if Issue had been taken in the Conjunctive Form in which the Plea was Pleaded, “and the defendant should prove that only a cable or anchor ar - rived in safety, he would be acquitted of the whole.” ~ Traverse Too Large — Qualif ication of Rule On the other hand, however, a Party may, in general, Traverse a Material Allegation of title or estate to the extent to which it is al leged, though it need not have been alleged to that extent; and such Traverse will not be considered as T oo Large. 3 ’ For example, in an Action of Replevin, the defendant Avowed the taking of the cattle as damage feasant, in the place in which, etc.; the same being the freehold of Sir F.

The defend ant Traversed that the plaintiff was seised in his demesne as of fee of B. close, and on De murrer the Court was of opinion that it was a Good Traver se; for, though a less estate than a seisin in fee would have been sufficient to sustain the plaintiff’s case, yet as the plain tiff, who should best know what estate he had, had Pleaded a seisin in fee, his adversary was entitled to Traverse the Title so laid. 35 Again, in an Action of Trespass for tres passes committed in a close of pasture con taining eight acres in the town of Tollard Royal, the defendant Pleaded that W., Earl of Salisbury, was seised in fee and of right of an ancient chase of deer cal led “Cranborn,” and that the said chase did extend itself as well in and through the said eight acres of pasture as in and through the said town of Toflard Royal, and Justified the trespasses as committed in using the said chase. The plaintiff Traversed th at the said chase ex - tended itself as well to the eight acres as to the whole town; and, Issue being taken there on, it was fried, and found for the plaintiff. It was then Moved, in Arrest of Judgment that this Issue and Verdict were faulty, “be cause if t he chase did extend to the eight acres only, it was enough for the defendant, and therefore the Finding of the Jury, that it did not extend as well to the whole town as to the eight acres, did not conclude against the defendants right in the eight acres, w hich was only in question. But it was answered by the Court, that there was no fault in the Issue, much less in the Verdict (which was according to the Issue); but the fault was in the defendants Plea that now takes the ex ception, for he puts in his Plea more than he needed, scil., the whole town, which being to his own disadvantage, and to the advantage of the plaintiff there was no reason for him to Demur upon it, but rather to admit it as he did, and so to put it in Issue. And so Judgment was given for the plaintiff.” 38 Traverse Too Narrow A TRAVERSE must not be Too Narrow) 1 Of a Traverse that is Too Narrow, the follow ing is an example: In an Action of Assumpsit brought for a compensation for the plaintiff’s service as a hired servant, the plaintiff a l leged that he served from March 21, 1647, to November 1, 1664. The defendant Pleaded that the plaintiff continued in the service till December, 1658, and then voluntarily quitted the service, without this, that he served until November 1, 1664. This was a Bad Traverse; for, as the plaintiff in this Action for Dam ages is entitled to compensation pro tanto for any period of service, it is obviously no answer to say that he did not serve the whole time alleged)’ 8 So a Traverse may be Too Narrow by being app lied to Part Only of an Allegation which the Law considers as in its nature indivisible and entire; such as that of a prescription or grant. Thus, in an Action of Trespass for Breaking and Entering the plaintiff’s close, called S.C., and digging stones the rein, the defendant Pleaded that there are certain wastes lying open to one an other — one the close called S.C., and the other cafled S.G. — .and so proceeded to prescribe for the liberty of digging stones in both doses, and Justified the trespasses under tha t prescription.

These are Statements of Fact, either in a Negative or Affirmative Form, which carry within them or imply within them material con trary, Affirmative, or Negative Statements or Inferences in favor of the adverse party. Such a Statement renders the Pleading bad für Amhiguity. THE doctrine of Negatives and Affirma tives Pregnant appears most properly to ar range itself under the head of ambiguity or evasiveness. The principle unde rlying the Rule against a Negative Pregnant has n.t been always dearly and satisfactorily ex plained in the various treatises. This seems true even though the older cases reveal that the fault was a frequent ground of objection. Thus, as early as the year 1449, in the case which appeared in a Year Book, 4 ’ in an action for negligently keeping a fire, by which plaintiff’s houses were burned, the defendant Pleaded that the plaintiff’s houses were not burned by the defendant’s negligence in keep ing his fire; a nd it was objected that the Traverse was not good, as it had Two Intend xnents, — one, that the houses were not burn ed; the other, that they were burned, but 89.

The same ground, that is, that of ambiguity, vQas taken in a case in the early part of the Reign of Edward Il (1307 — 1327) .~2 These two cases are believed to be the earliest authoriti es on the rule itself. And what is found in the later books on the subject tend to support the same view. A Negative Pregnant, therefore, may be defined as such a form of Negative Expres sion as may imply, or carry with it, an Af firmative, or to put the matter in another way, it is a Specific Denial which apparently Denies a Material Allegation, but which in fact leaves an Affirmative Allegation stand ing admitted, whereas an Affirmative Preg nant is an Affirmative Allegation implying a Negative. 43 To ill ustrate the Negative Pregnant, let us take two cases, one in which the issue is Immaterial and one in which the issue is Material. Suppose, in the first case, that 4 alleges that B went out into the rain without an umbrella, and then B Specifically Travers es or Denies that he went out into the rain without an umbrella. Has he denied that he went out into the rain? He has not. In 4~ - 7 Edw. U, 213, 226 (1313). 42. Blachmore y.

Co., 46 S - C. 70, 94,24 S.E. 74~ 77 (1896). Thus, If the defendant Is charged with taking a horse and a mule, a denial that lie took the horse and the mule Is a Negative Pregnant;"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"Page 468 of 735 Moser v. Jenkins, S Or. 447 (1875). Sec. 221 PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 445 this instance the Issue is ImmateriaL But suppose that A alleges that B struck him over the head with a hickory stick, and then that B Specifically Traverses or Denies that he struck A over the head with a hickory stick, Has B deni ed that he struck A? The answer is no, and in this case the defendant, by the Form of his Plea, has left Affirmatively Standing a Material Allegation, to wit, the striking.” Such a Mode of Pleading was deemed faulty under the Rule that such an Ambigu ous Form of Expression must be strictly construed against the Pleader. Thus, in the early case of Myn v. Cole,~~ in Trespass for Entering A’s house, B, the defendant, Plead ed that the plaintiff’s daughter gave him a License to do so, and that he entered by that License. In the Replication A stated that he did not Enter by her License, This was considered as a Negative Pregnant. It will be observed that this Form of Traverse may imply, or carry within it, that a License was given, though th e defendant, B, did not Enter by that License. It is, therefore, in the Lan guage of Pleading, said to be Pregnant with that Admission, that is, that a License was given. At the same time, the License is not expressly admitted; and the effect, there fore, is to leave it in doubt whether the plain tiff means to Deny the License or to Deny that the defendant Entered by virtue of that License. It is this ambiguity which appears to constitute the fault. 46 44 - In Baker v. BaIley, 16 Barb. 54 (1852), under the N ew York Code of 1848, the administrators of A’s estate alleged that B assaulted A on a certain day at a certain place, and that the assault caused the death of A. The answer, among other things, tra versed or denied that .8 assaulted A, the decedent, on th e day alleged. At the Trial, B offered evidence to prove that he never assaulted A at all. It was held that this Offer of Proof was inadmIssible under the Answer, as the Negative Pregnant admitted that the defendant made the assault alleged, but on a dif f erent day. 45. Oro.Jac. 87, 79 Engtep. 75 (1605). 46. Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions, a II, Of the Principal Rules of The following is another example: In Trespass for Assault and Battery, the de fendant Justified, for that he, being master of a ship, commanded the plaintiff to do some service in the ship; which he refusing to do, the defendant Moderately Chastised him. - The plaintiff Traversed, with an Abs que Hoc, that the defendant Moderately C hastised him; and this Traverse was held to be a Negative Pregnant; for, while it apparently means to put in Issue only the question of Excess (Admitting, by Implica tion, the Chastisement) it does not neces sarily and distinctly make that Admission; and i s, therefore, Ambiguous in its Form. 4 ’ If the plaintiff had Replied that the defend ant Immoderately Chastised him, the objec tion would have been avoided; but the proper Form of Traverse would have been de injuria sua propi -- la abs que aliqua tall cansa. This, by Traversing the whole “cause alleged,” would have distinctly put in Issue all the Facts in the Plea; and no Ambiguity or doubt as to the extent of the Denial would have arisen. This Rule against a Negative Pregnant, it is said by Stephen, appears in modern times, at least, to have received no very strict con struction. For many cases have occurred in which upon various grounds of distinction from the General Rule, that Form of Ex pression has been held free from objection. Thus, in Debt on a Bond, conditioned to per form the covenants in an indenture of lease, one of which covenants was that the de Pleading, § 5, 335 (3d Am. ed. by Tyler washington, B.

On De murrer to this Plea, it was Objected that the same was ill, and a Negative Preg nant, and that he ought to have said that such a one lawfully evicted him, to whom lie delivered the possession, or that he did not deliver the possession to any; but the Court held the Plea, as pursuing the words of the covenant, good, being in the Negative, and that the plaintiff ought to have Replied, and Assigned a Breach; and therefore Judgment was given against him. 48 A Denial that a person “carelessly and negligently did an act” is not a Denial that he did the act, and a Denial that a person “negligently” failed to look out for danger, is not a Denial that he actually failed to do so. “Material Facts alleged Conjunctively must be Denied Disjunctively.” ~ The de nial must not be in a Form that raises an Issue of the literal truth of the Entire Allega tion, without indicating whether it is claimed to be entirely or only partially false. THE SPECIFIC OR COMMON TRAVERSE 222. The Specific or Common Traverse is an Ex press Denial of a Particular Allegation in the Opposing Pleading in the Terms of the Allegation, accompanied by a Tender of Issue Qt Formal Offer of the point Denied for Trial. OF the various kinds of Traverses, Spe cific, Special or General, the most ordi nary and the most natural and primitive Travers~ is the so - called “Common or Specific Trav erse.” It consists of a Tender of Issue; 48.

See, also, Comment: Rule of Negative Pregnant in Pleading Applies only to Averment of Material Pacts, 83 Cent.L,J. 143 (1910), that is, of a Denial, accompanied by a Formal Offer of the point Denied for decision; and the Denial which it makes is in the Pleader’s Own Language and is by way of express contradiction in Terms of the Allegation Traversed — a point of considerable impor tance when we come to point out the danger of using the Specific Traverse. Such a Trav erse or Denial, which for this purpose are synonymous terms, controverts a Single Specific and Material Allegation of the Plead ing to which it is interposed.~° The Function of a Specific Traverse ITS use in a Plea is thus to Deny any Single One of the Allega tions of the Declara tion, the failure to prove which would destroy the plaintiff’s case, and where such Allega tion would not be controverted by the Gen eral Issue in the particular action. Thus, in an Action of Covenant on a lease for not repairing wind ows, a Specific or Com mon Traverse, would read as follows: “And the said B, the defendant, by X, his Attorney, comes and defends the wrong and injury when, etc., and says that the said A ought not to have or maintain his aforesaid action against him, the said B, because he says that the windows of the said messuage or tenement were not in any part thereof ruinous, in decay, or out of repair, in the Manner and Form as the said A hath above complained against him, the said B. And of this he puts himself upon the country.” It will be noticed that this Traverse is ex pressed in the Negative. This, however, is not invariably the case with a Specific or Common Traverse; for if it be opposed to a precedent Negative Allegation, it will, of course, be in the Affirm ative. Thus, where So.

First, as to the Argumentative Denial: An example is found in the famous case of Gibbons v. Pepper, 51 where the plaintiff brought Trespass for Assault and Battery, to which the defendant Pleaded that he rode his horse upon the highway, his horse be came frightened and ran away with him, and he couldn’t stop it; that he called to plaintiff to take care, the plaintiff did not get out of the way, and the horse ran over plaintiff against the will of the defendant. The plain tiff demurred to this Plea, and the Court gave judgment for plaintiff. It may not be con sidered a proper Plea in Confession and Avoidance, as it did not confess a trespass by defendant and then justify it, but rather alleged, hi effect, that the wrong was com mitted by the horse. Thus, it could be co n sidered an Argumentative Plea, as there are two affirmatives, the Allegation by the plain tiff of an act done by defendant, and defend St. ~ Ld.Itaym. 38, 91 Eng.1tep. 922 (1695). ant’s Plea that this Act was done by the horse. And, the General Rule is t hat Two Affirma tives do not make a good Negative. Second, as to the Negative Pregnant: A Negative Pregnant is a Plea which apparent ly traverses a Material Allegation in the Opponent’s Pleading, but which Affirma tively leaves a Material Allegation stand ing Admitted, under the theory that whatever is not Denied at the next Succeeding Stage of Pleading stands Admitted. Two examples, previously mentioned, will illustrate the point. A alleges that B went out into the rain without an umbrella. B specifically traverses or denies that he went out into the rain without an umbrella. Has he denied that he went out into the rain? Certainly not. But in this instance the Issue is Im materiai. Now, take a case where the Denial is material. A alleges that B struck him o ver the head with a hickory stick. B specifi cally Traverses or Denies that he struck A over the head With a hickory stick. Has he Denied the striking? Certainly not, and this time the Admitted Fact is Material, as that is the Fact which counts in an Actio n of Trespass for Assault and Battery. Thus, the danger of a defendant running into either an Argumentative Denial or a Negative Preg nant, had a tendency to discourage the use of the Specific Traverse — a procedure which it has been the aim of Modern Pleadi ng to restore. TILE SPECIAL TRAVERSE 223. The design of a Special Traverse, as distinguished from a Specific or Common Tra verse, and the General Issue, is to explain or set forth the Grounds of the Denial. The mat ter set up in the Inducement must be such as amounts to a sufficient answer to the Declara tion. The essential parts are: (a) The Inducement. (b) The Denial. Kottler & Peppy Com.taw PTdg. HB. — 16 448 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 22 (c) The Verification. (I) The Inducement in a Special Traverse is that Part which consists of an Affirmative Statement, Introductory to or Explanatory of the Denial; in itself it is an Argumentative or Indirect Denial; it must in itself amount to a sufficient Answer in Substance to the Opposing Plead ing; and it must not consist of a Direct Denial, nor be in the Nature of a Confession and Avoidance."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Page 471 of 735 The sufficiency of the Affirmation stated by way of Inducement to constitute a Defense may be tested by Demurrer. The Inducement cannot be Traversed unless the denial under the “Absque hoc” clause is bad, for it is a Rule that there can be no Tra verse upon a Traverse, unless the first one is bad; nor, subject to the same Exception, can it be answered in Confession an d Avoidance. (II) The Denial in a Special Traverse is in the Direct Form pursuing the words of the Allegation Traversed; its Form is by the use of the words “Absque Roe” (without this), that, etc. (III) The Special Traverse does not Tender Issue, but concl udes with a Veri fication, thus: “And this the said is ready to Verify.” (IV) Where a Special Traverse is suffi cient, the Other Party must Tender Issue, t 0 be accepted by the Patty Traversing. The Essential Requisites of the Special Trav erse THE Specia l Traverse had to satisfy Three Requirements as to Form; it consisted of: First, an Inducement containing an Af frrnative Statement of New Matter, which constituted an Indirect Denial of some Ma terial Allegation in the Pleading to which it was interposed ; Second, the Absque Hoc clause, consti tuting a Direct Denial of the Same Material Allegation and in the Same Language in which ft is made; and Third, the Conclusion in which the Party Pleading stated that he was ready to estab lish the truth of the matt ers set forth in his Plea, and which went by the name of Aver ment or Verification. The foregoing requisites were essential in order for a Special Traverse to be Good as to Form. It was also required that the In direct Denial contained in the Affirmative Statement by Way of Inducement and the Direct Denial in the Abs que Hoc Clause, should relate to the same matter in the Ad verse Pleading, according to Gould. 65 It may be observed that it was only a logical conclusion, from the very nature of a Special Tra verse, that the Direct Denial of the Abs que Hoc Clause was always a Negative Averment, which necessarily required the Party Pleading to it to do so by repeating his Affirmative Averment and Tendering Is sue therein. 53 Distinguished from the Specific Traverse — Effect ThE Traverse known more commonly as the Special Traverse differs from the Specific or Common Traverse, in that it is a Denial, preceded by Introductory Affirmative Matter, of Material Opposing Allegations; and, un like the other Forms of Traverse, it does not Tender Issue, but Concludes with a Verifica tion. 5 ’ 52.

Sec. 223 PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR iN BAR 449 While it was not ordinarily allowed to Plead Argumentatively what amounted to the General Issue, yet if the defendant were desirous of raising a Question of Law, and referring it to the Court rather than to the Jury, he was allowed, by this curious hybrid Plea known as the Special Traverse, to make an Argumentative Denial. The"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"Page 472 of 735 Inducement to the Traverse discloses the real nature of the Party’s Case and shows the Grounds upon which the Denial p roceeds. The Plea Con cludes with a Direct Denial under the Abs que 11cc Clause and an offer to Verify. (I) The EpeciaZ Traverse — Normal Form. — An illustration of how such a Traverse, in its Normal Form, operates will help to make the matter clear. Let us assume that A, the heir of a lessor, L, brought an Action of Debt against B, the lessee, on a covenant to pay rent, the Declaration alleging that the plain tiff’s ancestor, L, was seised in fee of the land; that L demised the land to the defend ant B, for a certain term of years; that the defendant, B, covenanted to pay a certain r ent; that L, the ancestor of the plaintiff died, that the reversion descended to A, the plaintiff; and that the rent became due from B, the defendant, to A, the plaintiff. Suppose that B, the defendant, opposes the alleged liability, as set forth in the D eclara tion, by saying “that, after the making of the said indenture, the said reversion of the said premises did not belong to the said L, the plaintiff A’s ancestor, and his heirs in the Manner and Form as the said A hath in his said Declaration alleged. And of this the said B puts himself upon the country.” This is a Specific or Common Traverse. Suppose, however, that instead of using a Specific Traverse, the defendant B pleads that the plaintiff, A, ought not to maintain his action “because he says tha t L, the plain tiff’s ancestor, now deceased, at the time of the making of the said indenture, was seized in his demesne as of a freehold, for the term of his natural life, of and In the said demised premises, and continued so seized thereof un til and at the time of his death; and that, after the making of the said indenture, and before the expiration of the said term, to wit, onthe dayof ,A.D. at aforesaid, the said L died; where upon the term created by the said indenture wholly ceased and determined; W ithout this, that after the making of the said indenture, the reversion of the said demised premises belonging to the said L and his heirs in the Manner and Form as the said A hath in his said Declaration alleged. And this the said B is ready to verify. Wh erefore he Prays Judg ment if the said A ought to have or maintain his aforesaid action against him.” • The Substance of this Plea is that the plain~ tiff’s ancestor, L, was seized for life only, and therefore that the term terminated at his death, which involves a Denial of the Allega tion in the Declaration that the reversion be longed to the father in fee. The defendant’s course was therefore to Traverse the Declara tion. Instead of doing so in the Common Form (by using the Specific or Common Traverse), he has adopted the Special Form (the Special Traverse), first setting out the New Affirmative Matter, that the plaintiff’s ancestor, L, was seized for life, etc., and then annexing to this the Denial that the reversion belonged to him and his heirs by tha t peculiar formula: “Without this, that,” etc. The Special Traverse does not, like the Specific or Common Traverse, Tender Issue, but Concluded, prior to the Hilary Rules in 1834, with the words: “And this the said B is ready to Verify, wherefore he Prays Judg ment,” etc., which is called a “Verification” and ‘Prayer of Judgment,” and is the con stant Conclusion of all Pleadings in which Issue is not Tendered. 55 The Affirmative 65. There never was, apparently, any good reason for concluding this Plea with a verification, thus post poning the tender of the Issue. By the Hilary Rules In 1834, such a Plea was required to conclude to the country; that is, to tender Issue. Martin, Civil Pro cedure at Common Law, c. XI, Defences in Bar by 450 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch 22 Part of the Traverse — that is, the part which sets forth the New Matter — is called its “In ducement”; the Negative Part is called the “Absque Hoc Clause”; those being the Latin words formerly used, and from which the modern expression, “without this,” is trans lated. 56 These different parts and properties are all essential to a Special Traverse, which must always thus consist of an Inducement, a Denial, and a Verification; that is, prior to the Hilary Rules. The Regular Method of Pleading in answer to a Special Traverse was to Tender Issue upon it, with a repetition"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Page 473 of 735 of the Allegation Traversed. Thus, to the Plea heretofore given by way of illustration, the Replication would read: “And, as to the said Plea by the said B above Pleaded, the said A. says that by reason of anything therein alleged he ought not to be barred from having and maintaining his aforesaid action against the said B, because the said A says that after the making of the said indenture the reversion of the said de mised premises belong ed to the said L and his heirs, in the Manner and Form as the said A hath in his said Declaration above alleged. And this he Prays may be inquired of by the country.” The effect, therefore, of a Special Traverse, is, as in Replevin where the defendant Ple ads an Avowry, to postpone the Issue to One Stage of the Pleading later than would be attained by a Specific or Common Traverse, for if the defendant should Deny in the Com mon Form without an Inducement, and Con clude to the Country, it would only remain Way of Traverse, § 286, Conclusion of Special Trav erse, 243, 244 (St. Paul, 1905). ~6. The denial may be introduced by other forms of expression besides abaqite koc. Et non will suffice. Bennet v. J4’Ilkins, 1 Wms.Saund. 20, 85 Eng.Rep. 20 (1666); Walters v. Hodges, Lut. 1625, 125 Eng.Ilep. 684 (1692). for the plaintiff to add the Similiter, and Issue would therefore be Joined, whereas, on a Special Traverse, the Issue is Not Tendered until the Next Pleading. (II) The Special Traverse — Abnor mal Form,~ — Once established as a recognized part of the Common Law System of Pleading, the Special Traverse grew in favor. As a result of this development it was adopted in cases where the original reasons for such a Form of Pleading were inapplicable, as in cases where the Inducement included No New Explana tory Matter, but consisted in a mere repetition of the Original Declaration. 57 Thus, for ex ample, in cases of assault, where the defend ant Justified his act under a Warrant of Ar rest, the plaintiff w as permitted to Reply that the defendant of his own wrong, made the as sault, without this, — that he had any War rant of Arrest to justify his act. Although this Form of the Special Trav erse was Abnormal and a manifest departure from the General Requirements of a Special Traverse as defined by the leading authori ties, it nevertheless received the approval of the Courts~ As, however, it was used only occasionally, it has in Modern Times b een largely superseded by the Specific or Com mon Traverse. Form of Declaration and Special Traverse AS the Special Traverse was and is one of the most technical Pleas known to the Common Law, its Character and Scope may appear more clearly from a study of its form. Accordingly, a Form of a Declaration, to 57. Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Piead ing in Civil Actions, c.

Thus, in the example of a Special Traverse above discussed, it was improper to Traverse in the Specific or Common form, viz., “that after the making of the said in - dentur e the reversion of the said demised premises did not belong to the said L and his heirs,” &c., because, by a Rule of Law, a tenant is precluded, or in the Language of Pleading, Estopped from Alleging that his lessor, Ii, had no title in the premises de mis ed; and a general assertion that the re version did not belong to him and his heirs would appear to be prohibited by the same Rule. A tenant, however, is not by law ~0. A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions, c. II, Of the Principal Rul es of Pleading, * 1, p. 180 (34 ed. by Tyler, Washington, ii 0. 1882). 60.

There may be many reasons why it might be desirable that, without going to Trial, a litigant bring a question before the Court for determination in the first instance, and for that purpose an Issue of Law should be raised. In such a case, therefore, the Pleader would state the circumstanc es of the transaction in an In - ducement, substituting a Special for a Spe cific Traverse. The facts thus alleged by Way of Inducement are not subject to Tra verse, but may be Demurred to as insufficient in Law to contradict the Declaration.

Pullman’s Palace (UI) The Abs que Hoc Clause and the Con clusion with a Veriftcation. — Although these reasons seem to show the purpose of the Inducement, they do not account for the Two Other Distinctive Features of the Sp e cial Traverse, viz., the .etbsque hoc Clause and the Conclusion with a Verification. For it will naturally suggest itself that the Af firmative Matter, in each of the above cases, might have been Pleaded per se, without the addition of the Absque Hoc Cla use. So,. whether the Abs que Hoc were added or not,. the Pleading, consistently with any of the above reasons, might have Tendered Issue, like a Specific or Common Traverse, instead of Concluding with a Verification. These latter Forms were dictated by o ther principles. The Direct denial, under the Abs que Hoc Clause, was made necessary by this consideration: that the Affirmative Matter, taken alone, would constitute only an Indirect, or as it is called in Pleading, an Argumentative Denial of the preceden t statement; and under the Rule that Plead ings must be Direct and not Argumentative, all Argumentative Pleading is prohibited. In order, therefore, to avoid the Defect in Form of Argumentativeness, the course adopted was to follow up the Explanatory, Affi rma tive Statement of Matter by Way of Induce ment with a Direct Denial. 62 With respect to the Verification, this Con clusion was adopted in a Special Traverse, with a view to Another Rule, to the effect that wherever New Matter is introduced int~ a Plead ing it is improper to Tender Issue, hence the Conclusion must consequently close with a Verification.

As we have seen, it is the object of the Inducement to give an explained or qualified De nial; that is, to state such circumstances as tend to show that the Last Pleading is not true, the Abs que Hoc being added merely to put that Denial in a Positive Form, which previ ously had been made in an Indirect Form. Now, an Indirect Denial amounted, in Sub stance, to an Answer, without the aid of the Absque Hoc Clause, and despite the fact that it was Argumentative in Form. It fol lows, therefore, that an Inducement, when properly framed, must always in itself con tai n, without the aid of the Abs qua Hoc Clause, an Answer, in Substance to the Last Pleading.~ Thus, in our example above, the Allegation that L was seised for life, and 64.

The second Rule, which followed from the same consideration, as to the object and use of a Special Traverse, was that the An swer given by the Inducement could be of no other nature than that of an Indirect Denial; the Inducement was bad if it con sisted of a Direct Denial.°’ Thus, the plain tiff being bound by Recognizance to pay one X £300 in six years, by £50 per annum, at a certain place, alleged that he was ready every day at that place to have paid to X one of the said installments of £50, but that X was not there to receive it. To this the defendant Pleaded that X was ready at the place to receive the £50, Abs que hoc, that the plaintiff was there ready to have paid it. The plaintiff Demurred on the ground that the Inducement alleging X to have been at the place ready to receive contained a Direct Denial of the plaintiff’s precedent al legation that X was not there, and should therefore have Concluded to the Country, without the Abs qua Hoc Clause, and Judg ment was given accordingly for the plain tiff. 6~ The third rule was that the answer given by the Inducement must not be in the Nature of a Plea in Confession and Avoidance. 69 Thus, if the defendant, B, makes title as the assignee of a term of years of X, and the plaintiff, A, in answer to this, claims under a prior assignment to himself from X of the same term, this is a Confession and Avoid ance; for it admits the assignment to the 67.

Therefore, if the plaintiff, A, Pleads such assignment to himself by Way of Inducement, adding, under an Absque Hoc, a Denial that X as signed to the defendant, this Special Traverse is bad. The plaintiff should Plead the as signment to himself as in Confession and Avoidance, without the Traverse. Still a fourth Rule may be added, which Martin ‘° says was more distinctively a Rule of Practice, resulting from the Nature of an Inducement. The Rule was that with re spect to Special Traverses, the Opposite Party has no right to Traverse an I nduce ment, or, as the Rule is more commonly ex pressed, there could be no Traverse upon a Traverses’ Thus, in the example given above, if the Replication, instead of reaffirm ing the matter denied in the Absque Hoc Clause, had Traversed the Inducement ei ther in the Special or Common form, deny ing that L, the lessor, at the time of making the indenture, was seised in his demesne as of freehold for the term of his natural life, etc., such Replication would have been bad, as containing a Traverse upon a Tra verse, The reason for the Rule is both Formal and Technical. 72 By the first Traverse a matter is denied by one of the parties which had been alleged by the other, and which, having 19. civil Procedure at Common Law, C.

This Rule is, however, open to an im portant Exception, viz., that there may be a Traverse upon a Traverse when the first is a bad one, or, in other words, if the Denial under the Abs que Hoc of the first Traverse be Insufficient in Law, it may be passed by, and a new Traverse taken on the Induce ment. 73 Thus, in an Action of Prohibition, the plaintiff declared he was elected and admitted as one of the Common Council of th e City of London, but that the defendants delivered a Petition to the Court of Com mon Council, complaining of an undue elec tion, and suggesting that they themselves were chosen; whereas (the plaintiff alleged) the Common Council had No Jurisdiction to ex amine the validity of such an election, but the same belonged to the Court of the Mayor and Aldermen. The defendants Pleaded that the Common Council, time out of mind, had authority to determine the election of Com mon Councilmen; and that the defendants b eing duly elected the plaintiff intruded him self into the office; whereupon the defend ants delivered their Petition to the Common Council, complaining of an undue election; without this, that the Jurisdiction to examine the validity ofsuch election belon ged to the Court of Mayor and Aldermen. The plain tiff Replied by Traversing the Inducement; that is, he Pleaded that the Common Council had not authority to determine the election of Common Councilmen, Concluding to the Country. To this the defendants Dem urred, and the Court adjudged that the first Trav erse was bad, because the question in this 13.

As the Inducement cannot, when the De nial, under the Absque Hoc, is Sufficient in Law, be Traversed, so, for the same reasons, it cannot be answered by a Pleading in Con fession and Avoidance. But, on the other hand, if the Denial be insufficient in Law, the Opposite Party has then a right to Plead in Confession and Avoidance of the Induce ment, or (according to the nature of the case) to Traverse it; or he may Demur to the whole Traverse for the Insufficiency of the Denial. As the Inducement of a Special Traverse, when the Denial under the .ttbsque Hoc is sufficient, can neither be Traversed nor Con fessed and Avoided, it follows that there is, in that case, no Manner of Pleading to the Inducement. The only way, therefore, of answering a good Special Trav erse Is to Plead to the Abs que Hoc, which is done by Tendering Issue on such denial. But, though there can be no Pleading to an Inducement, when the Denial under the Abs que Hoc is sufficient, yet the Inducement may be open, in that case, to Exception in Point of Law. If it be faulty in any respect, as, for example, in not containing a Sufficient Answer in Sub stance, or in giving an Answer by Way of Direct Denial, or by way of Confession and Avoidance, the Opposite Party may Demur to the whole Traverse, t hough the Abs que Hoc be good, for this insufficiency in the Inducement. The Use of the Special Traverse at the Present Time HAVING explained the Form, the Effect, and the Use and Object of a Special Traverse, it remains to show in what cases this Method .01 Pleading is or ought to be applied at the present day. First, it is observed by Stephen, that this Form was at no period applicable to every case of Denial, at the pleasure of the Pleader. There are many cases of Denial to which the plea of Special Tra verse has never been applied, and which have always been and still are the subjects of Traverse in the Common Form exclusively. 14 These it is not easy to enumerate or define; they are determined by the course of precedent, and in that way become known to t he prac titioner. On the other hand, in many cases where the Special Traverse used anciently to occur, it is now no longer practiced. Even when"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"Page 479 of 735 the formula was most in repute, the use of this species does not appear to have been regarded as matter of neces sity; and, in cases which admit or require no Allega tion of New Matter, we find the Special and the Common Traverse to have been indiffer ently used by the Pleaders of those days. But in Modern Times the Special Traverse, without an Inducement of New Matter, has been considered, not only as unnecessary, but as frequently improper. As the taste in Pleading gradually simplified and im proved, the prolix and dilatory effect of a Special Traverse brought it into disf avor with the Courts; and they began, not only to enforce the doctrine that the Common Form might allowably be substituted in cases where there was No Inducement of New Matter, but often intimated their preference of that Form to the other. 75 There is a t actical disadvantage to the Pleader, in the use of the Special Traverse, that the Inducement tends to open the real nature of the party’s case, by giving notice to his adversary of the precise grounds on which the Denial proceeds, and thus facilitates to t he latter the preparation of his Proofs, or enables him to test the Grounds of Defense by Demurrer. And even though the case be 74. Borne v. Lewin, I Lditaym. 041, 91 Eng.Rep. 1328 (1700). 7th RobInson v. I 4 aley, I Burr. 320, 97 Ellg.Itop. 330 (3757). Sec. 224 PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 457 such as would admit of an Inducement of New Matter explanatory of the Denial, the usual course is to omit any such Inducement, and to make the Denial in an Absolute Form, with a Tender of Issue; thus substituting the Common for the Special Formula. The latter, however, appears to be still allow able when the case is such as admits of an Inducement of New Matter, except in certain instances to which, by the course of precedent, the Common Form of Traverse has always be en exclusively applied. And, where allowable, it should still be occasion ally adopted, in a view to the various grounds of necessity or convenience by which it was originally suggested. TUE GENERAL ISSUE — ITS NATURE AND USE 224. The General issue is a Denial of the Legal Conclusion sought to be drawn from the Declaration. It Denies by a General Form of expression the defendant’s liability, and enables the de fendant to contest, without Specific Averments of the Defense to be asserted , most of the Al legations which the plaintiff may be required to prove in order to sustain his action, and in some actions to raise also various Affirma tive Defenses. It fails to perform the Func tions of Pleading, either in giving Notice or in reducing the case to Specific Issues. The Nature and Use of the General Issue WHILE the Specific or Common Traverse is of frequent occurrence, there is another class of Traverse which, from its great im portance and use, requires particular study. This form of Tra verse is known as the Gen eral issue, under which, in most of the Mod ern Common - Law Actions, there is an appro priate Form of Plea fixed by Ancient Usage, as the proper method of Traversing the Dec laration, where the defendant means to deny the defendant ’s liability. This Form of Traverse appears to have been so called because the issue that it Tenders is of a more general and comprehensive character than that tendered by the Specific or Com mon Traverse. The General Issue, which is one of the two General Traverses, the Repli cation De Injuria 76 being the other, differs from the Specific or Common Traverse in that it Denies by a General Form of expres sion, such as “Not Guilty,” the defendant’s liability, instead of Denying some Specific Allegation of Fac t on which his liability de pends. Or, put in a slightly different way, it differs in two respects: First, in Point of Form, the General Issue Traverses, not by words of Direct Denial, but, as Professor Keigwin says, “ by a fixed phrase of compendious negation”, such as Nil Debet in Debt or Non Assumpsit in"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"Page 480 of 735 Special or General Assumpsit; and Second, it generally operates to Deny and thus places in Issue, not a Single, Material Al legation, but all the Essential facts whi ch con stitute the plaintiff’s cause of action,n As thus developed, the Scope and Effect of the Plea by way of the General Issue assumes great significance, as the Tender of Issue thus made on the Declaration oper ates to close the Pleadings, and to enabl e the defendant to escape from the earlier re quirement that he must rest his Defense on a Single, Material Allegation, thereby, from the defendant’s point of view, facili tating the progress of the cause. It should be observed, however, that the General I ssue was in Form a Specie of “Licensed Du plicity, in that by such a Plea the defendant, into flatu [at one breathil Denies all the Several Facts alleged in the Declaration.” ~ Thus, the General Issue provides a brief and convenient form of Plea in many ac tions, comprehensive in its nature, and under which the defendant is or was permitted to prove, 6. The Replication Dc Injuria Is discussed in Chap ter 23. ~1 - Keigwin, Cases In Common - Law Pleading, Bk. II, The Rules of Pleading, e. VII, The General Issues , 500 (24 ed. flochester, 1934). 78. IbId. DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS without Specific Allegation, almost All Mat ters in Denial of his liability, as alleged, or to contest in evidence All Allegations requir ing Proof on the part of the plaintiff. - In Case, Eie ctment, Trespass, in its Three Forms, and Trover, the Plea of the General Issue was, Not Guilty; in Replevin, Won Cepit; in Detinue, Non Detinet; in Debt upon a Simple Contract, Nil Debet; in Debt on a Specialty and in Covenant, it was Non efl Factum; and, in both Special and General As sumpsit, Non Assumpsit, or that the defend ant made no such Promise. The effect of these General Issues varied with the different Forms of Action, as to what Defenses could be set up under them, and what must be raised by Sp ecific Denials aimed at Particu lar Allegations, and what by Pleas in Confes sion and Avoidance. To confine the investigation to the points of actual disagreement, and relieve the plain tiff of the burden of proving what the defend ant does not really dis pute, it is provided in Code Pleading that the plaintiff may Verify his Complaint, and then the Denials of the Answer must be Specific, and must also be made under Oath. This requires the Denials to be truthfully made, and to put in Issue only the points o n which the defendant means to rely. Thus, in a suit on a fire insurance policy, there may be rio dispute as to the execution of the contract sued on, but the company may expect to avoid liability by showing in Defense some excuse. Accord ingly, if the Complaint be Verified, the com pany cannot Deny the signature or due ex ecution of the policy, of which the Proof might be difficult for the plaintiff to obtain and produce. It is a great imposition to com pel the plaintiff to produce, and the Court to hear, evidence in regard to what is not truly disputed. It is burdensome enough to have to establish rights in real controver sies. 7 ° At Common Law, while it is a prin ciple that Pleadings ought to be true, ye there were no means of enforcing the RulE Thus the Common - Law Pleadings often fail ed to reduce the case to the real Issues ii dispute. Report of the Common - Law Commissioners, ot which the Rules of HilT. 4 Wm. IV were founded by which the Scope of the General Issue was limit ed, it is said: “ Special Pleading, considered in its principle, is a valuable forensic invention peculiar to the Common Law of England, by the effect of which the precise point in controversy between the parties is developed, and presented in a shape fit for decision. If t hat point is found to consist of matter of fact, the parties are thus apprised of the exact nature of the question to be decided by the Jury, and are enabled to prepare tl,eir proofs with proportionate precision. If, on the other hand, it turns out to be M atter of Law, they have the means of immediately obtaining the decision of the cause, without the expense and trouble of a Trial, by De - murrer; that is, by referring the legal question so evolved, to the determination of the Judge. But where, Instead of Sp ecial Pleading, the General Is sue is used, and under it the defendant is allowed to bring forward matters in Confession and Avoid ance, these benefits are lost. Consisting, as that Plea does, of a mere summary denial of the case stated by the plaintiff, a nd giving no notice of any defensive Allegation on which the defendant means to rely, it sends the whole ease on either side to Trial, without distinguishing the fact from the law, and without defining the exact question or ques tions of fact to be tried. It not unfrequently, there fore, happens that the parties arc taken by surprise, and find themselves opposed by some unexpected matter of defense or reply, which, from the want of timely notice, they are not In due condition to re sist. But nfl effect of m ore common, a,id indeed al most invariable, occurrence is the unnecessary ac - cumulation of proof, and consequently of expense; for as nothing is admitted upon the Pleadings, each party is obliged to prepare"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"Page 481 of 735 himself, an far as it is practicable, with eviden ce upon nil the difFerent points which the Nature of the Action can by pos sibility make it Incumbent upon him to establish, though many of them may turn out to he undisput ed, and many of them may be such as his adversary, if compelled to plead specially, would have thought it unñesirable to dispute. It may even happen (and that Is not an unfreguent occurrence) that the con troversy under this form of Plea turns entirely up on the Matter of Law, there being no fact really in dispute; and In that case the Mode of Decision by Jury is not only defective, but misplaced, and the Trial might have been spared altogether, if the par ties bad proceeded by way of Special Pleading, and raised the questIon upon Demurrer.” 458 Gb. 2 ~9. Bl iss, Law of Pleading Under the Codes of Civil Procedure, ~l 138, 422 (St. Louis, 1987), In the Sec. 224 Nothing could be more absurd than the irregular, variable, and arbitrary Scope of the General Issue in the Different Forms of Action. There is no rhyme or reason or policy in it; nothing but a bewilderment of historical eccentricities. The Function of Pleading is to ascertain with precision the Matters on which the Parties differ and the points on which they agree, and thus to arrive at Certain Clear - Cut Issues upon which the case has to be decided. The main Object of Pleadings is to produce such Is sues, and thus to narrow the controversy to the real points which have to be contested and proved. The practical utility of Plead ings to accomplish this func tion or object has been grievously impaired by the unrea sonable Scope and Latitude which are allowed to the General Issue in some actions. The apparent Singleness and Simplicity of the General Issue are entirely illusory. It fails to focus the controversy upon the real point. It frequently violates the Rule that a Party must either Plead by Way of Denial or in Confession and Avoidance. In Assumpsit, Case, Debt on Simple Contract, Ejectment, and Trover, the General Issue has an Ex ceedingly Broad Scope, whi ch cannot be ex plained by any principle or process of reason. ing. What has to be Specially Pleaded is largely an accidental matter of arbitrary exceptions. SO When the defendant Pleaded Affirmatively to justify or excuse the charge, it was neces sary to set forth the Particular Facts of palliatidn and excuse by a Special Plea of Confession and Avoidance, which would ap - prise the Court and the Adverse Party of the nature and circumstances of the Defense; but, Special Pleading having become per verted into an obstacle to justice, the Courts, by relaxation of the strictness anciently ob served, permitted the Scope of the General aO.

Where a given Defense can be set up under the General Issue, it is improper to attempt to raise that Defense by a Specific Traverse. Where the General Issue can be used as a Denial, it must be used. The reason for, requiring the General Issue seems to have been to close the Pleadings at an early Stage. The Rule, however, does not prohibit a Pa rty from Pleading Affirmatively New Matter which is Admissible under the General Is sue, but only such as constitutes a mere DeniaL 8 ’ In view of the important character of this Plea in restricting the progress of the Plead ings and extending the privilege of the de fendant in establishing his Defense in evi dence, it seems proper here to explain in what cases it should be used. To do this, it is necessary to examine the Scope of the Different General Issues in each Particular Action, to ascertain what Defe nses must or must not be Pleaded Specially. In One Action a given Defense may be Admissible under the General Issue, while in another the Same Defense would require a Specific Traverse or an Affirmative Plea. 81. English: Warner v.

PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 460 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS Cli. 22 PLEAS IN CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE — THE NATURE AND FORM 225. If, histead of Denying in the Direct Form, the Party wishes to assert a Defense in Justification or Discharge of the Matter alleged, lie must Plead by Way of Confession and Avoidance. Pleading in Confession and Avoidance Admits the Truth of Opposing Al legations, and Avoids their Legal Effect by alleging Other Facts. Pleas in Confession and Avoidance are di vided, wi th reference to their subject - matter, into (a) Pleas in Justification or Excuse. Such a Plea, while Admitting the Facts alleged by the plaintiff, shows in effect that he had not at any time a Good Cause of Action, either by reason of some legal right of th e ,lefendant justifying his conduct in Point of Law, or some act or conduct of the plaintiff excusing him from liability in the particular case. (b) Pleas in Discharge. Such a Plea Ad mits that a Cause of Action once existed in the plaintiff, but shows that it has been Discharged by some Matter subsequent, either of Fact or of Law. Pleadings in Confession and Avoidance tie not Tender Issue, but Conclude with a Verifica tion and Prayer of Judgment. In General A PLEADING in Confession and Avoid ance, as t he terms imply, does not, like the Traverse, deny the Allegations of Fact con tained in the Opposing Pleading, but Con fesses them, mid Avoids their Legal Effect. A Plea in Confession and Avoidance, for in stance, Confesses the Truth of the Allega tions in the Declaration, either expressly or by implication, and then proceeds to allege New Matter which deprives the Facts ad mitted of their Ordinary Legal Effect, and avoids them - Thus, in an Action of Tres pass for Assault and Battery, a Plea Admit ting Fact s alleged to have been done by the defendant, but showing that they were done by the plaintiff, is a Plea in Cünfession and Avoidance. Affirmative Pleas in Confession and Avoid ance are either by Way of Justification and Excuse, showing that, even admitti ng plain tiff’s prima fade case, he never had a Cause of Action, or by way of Discharge, showing that, although a Cause of Action once existed, yet it has been taken away by some Subse quent Matter. Pleas of Estoppel are another variety of Affirmative Plea s. 52 Pleas in Justification or Excuse A PLEA in Justification or Excuse shows that the plaintiff never had at any time a good Cause of Action, either by reason of some legal right of the defendant justifying his conduct in Point of Law, or some act or conduct of the plaintiff Excusing him (the defendant) from liability in the particular case. The Former is a Plea in Justification; the latter, a Plea in Excuse. This distinction is supported by authority, though Pleas of Both Classes are usually treated together, as being of the same general effect. Where the defendant, admitting the facts stated by the plaintiff to be true, alleges in contradic tion the exercise of a right founded upon Matter of Title, Interest in or Respectin g Land, Authority derived either Mediately or Immediately from the plaintiff, or the operation of some General Rule of Law ap plicable to the particular case, the Plea is one of Justification, the Defense being that the doing or omission of the acts compla ined of was Justified in Point of Law by the ex istence of such right. Here the facts must be fully set forth, as a Justification must be Specially Pleaded.ss But where, still Ad 82, Dana v. Bryant, 1 Gil. (Ill.) 104 (1844). 83. English: Smart v.

GIVING COLOR 226. A Plea in Confession and Avoidance must Give Color; that is, admit the apparent truth of the plaintiff’s Allegations and give him credit for an apparent or prima facie Right of Action, which the New Matter in the Plea destroys. Color may be Express or im plied. Implied Color is the tacit a dmission of the plaintiff’s prima facie case by failure to deny it. Express Color is a Fictitious Allegation, not Traversable, to give an appearance of right to the plaintiff, and thus enable the defendant to Plead Specially his own Title, which would otherwise amount to the General Issue. It is a licensed evasion of the rule against Pleading Contradictory Matter Specially. Giving Color IT is a rule that Every Pleading by way of Confession and Avoidance must Give Color. “Color”, as a Term of Pleading, sig nifies an apparent or prima fade right; and the meaning of the Rule that Every Plead ing in Confession and Avoidance must Give Color is that it must admit an apparent right in the Opposite Party, and rely, there fore, on some New Matter by which that a pparent right is defeated. 5 ° £~.

Pleas in Confession and Avoidance must either ex pressly or impliedly admit that the Allegations in the Declaration are true, with a statement of mat ter which destroys their effect, and must confess a prima fade Right of Action in the opposite party, and then state new matter by which that apparent righ t Is defeated. Bavarian Brewing Ca v. Eetkow ski, 1 W.W.Harr, 225, 113 A. 903 (Del.Super.192 1 ). Sec. 226 PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 463 I lease was executed as alleged in the Plea, and that the defendant, therefore, is apparently Discharged, but he sets up New Matter by which the effect of the Plea is avoided, name ly, that the Release was obtained by duress. Suppose, on the other hand, the plaintiff, instead of Replying as above stated, should Reply that the Release was executed by him, but to another person, and not to the defend ant. This Replication would be bad as a Replication in Confession and Avoidance, for Wanting Color, because, if the Release were not to the defendant, there would not exist even an apparent Defense, requiring the Al legation of New Matter to avoid it; and the Plea might be sufficiently answered by a Traverse, denying that the deed stated in the Plea is the deed of t he plaintiff. So, in an Action of Trespass Quare Clausum Fregit, where the Declaration charges the defend ants with breaking and entering the plain tiff’s close, a Plea by Way of Confession and Avoidance is bad, as Wanting Color, where it alleges that at t he time of the alleged Tres pass one of the defendants was seised in tail of the said close, and the other defendant in possession of it, as his lessee for years, since, if this be so, it follows that the plaintiff has not even a colorable right to maintai n the Action as for Trespass to his close. 8~ In such SI. So, in Trespass de bonis Asportatis, a Plea that the goods in question were the property of a third person, and that the defendant took them by virtue of an attachment against him, is bad, as amount ing to the General Issue, for it involves a denial of the plaintiff’s possession, and therefore gives no color to the Action. The thing to do in such a case, as We shall see, is to give express color. See, in support and illustration of the text, Brown v. Artcher, 1 Hill (N.Y.) 266; Collet v. Flinn, 5 Cow. (N.Y.) 466. In Conger v. Johnston, 2 Denio (N.Y.) 96, it was held that a Plea of the Statute of Limitations averring that “the severai Causes of Action, etc., if any such there were or still are, did not accrue within,” etc., was bad for want of color. “Every Plea In Confes sion and Avoidance,” It was said, “must give color, by admitting an apparent or prima fade right in the plaintiff, It must either expressly or impliedly confess that, but for the matter of avoidance con tained in the Plea, the Action could be maintained. a case the usual and regular course would be, not to Plead in Confession and Avoidance, but to plead the General Issue, Not Guilty, which puts the plainti ff’s possession of the close in issue, as well as the mere fact of the Trespass. The tacit admission, by failure to Deny, which we have just been considering, has been called “Implied Color,” to distinguish it from another kind, which is in some instanc e s inserted in the Pleading, and is therefore called “Express"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"Page 486 of 735 Color.” 88 Where the Nature of the Defense is such that it would contradict the plaintiff’s prima fade case, the defendant cannot Plead it This Plea makes no such confession, and is there fore bad. Instead of saying, as the pleader should have done, that the several Causes of Action men tioned in the Declaration did not accrue within six years, the words are that the several supposed Causes of Action mentioned in the Declaration, ‘if any su ch there were, or still are, did not accrue within six years. The defendants do not admit that but for the statute of Limitations the plaintiff could have sued.” And see Margetts v. Bays, 4 Ado]. & B. 489, 111 Bug. Rep. 871 (1836); Gould V. Lashury, 1 Cr. , M. & Ii. 254, 140 Eng.Rep. 1075 (1834), (where, in an Action of Debt on Simple Contract, a Plea that the de fendant was discharged under tile insolvent debtor’s act from the debts and Causes of Action, “if any,” etc. was held bad). But see, contra, Wise v. Hodsoll, 11 Adol. & E. SIB, 113 Engltep. 024 (1541), where, in an Action of Tres pass for assault and battery, a Flea, that “if any hurt or damage happened or was occasioned” to the plaintiff, it was by reason of the defendants acting in self - defense, etc., was sustained. 88. “The learned Serjeant Williams, whose notes up on Saunders’ Reports arc often cited in this work; was a gentleman of very florid complexion, which circumstance gave the irreverent youth of the bar occasion to say that he bad much express color. Tradition Informs us also that the same Serjeant Williams had a country place near Londoji, to which he was wont to resort for the week - end, and that he drove a horse which was given to balking; whereupon it was commented, hew strange it was that a horse belonging to s~ learned a pleader should demur when he ought to go to the country.” Kcig win, Precedents of Pleading at Common Law, 554 (Washington, fl C., 1910). 464 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS Cli. 22 Specially without giving Express Color in order to have something to avoid. Express Color is defined to be “a feigned matter pleaded by the defendant in an Ac tion of Trespass, from which the plaintiff seems to have a good cause of action, where as he has in truth only an Appearance or Color of Cause. ” 80 It is the setting up of a straw man, in order to have something to knock down. It occurs at present only in Trespass, and is very seldom used even in that action. Its use and nature may be thus explained: The necessity of an Implied Color has evidentl y the effect of obliging the Pleader to Traverse in many instances in which his case, when fully stated, does not turn on a mere Denial of Fact, but involves some consideration of Law. In the example first above given of Want of Color, this would not be so , for if the deed of Release were executed, not to the defendant, but to a dif ferent person, this, of course, amounts to no more than a mere Denial that the deed, as alleged in the Plea, is the deed of the plain tiff, and no Question of Law can be said to arise tmder this Traverse. But, in the sec ond example given above of want of Implied Color, suppose the plaintiff was in the wrongful possession of the close, without any further appearance of title than the posses si on itself, at the time of the trespass alleged and that the defendants entered in the as sertion of their title, They could not, with out more, set forth their title in a Plea by Way of Confession and Avoidance, because, as we have seen, it would not Give Color, 89. 5 Bacon, Abridgment of the Law, “Trespass,” 1, 208 (0th ed. Dublin, 1793); English: Leyfield’s Case, 10 Ce. SOb, 77 Eng.Bep. 1057 (1610); Comyns t. Boy er, Cro.Elis. 485, 78 Eng.Itep. 786 (11590); Fletcher v.

V, Law and Fact In Jury TrIals, 232 — 234 (Boston, 1598), on Express Colo r as a method of withdrawing questions from the Jury by Pleading in confession and Avoidance. and they would therefore be driven to Plead the General Issue, Not Guilty. By this Plea an issue is produced, whether or not the de fendants are guilty of the Tre spass; but up on Trial of the Issue it may be found that the question turns entirely upon Construc tion of Law. The defendants say they are not guilty of breaking the “close of the plain - tiff,” as alleged in the Declaration, and the reason that they are no t guilty is that they had the title and right to possession of the close. Their title involves a legal question, and yet this question, under the plea of Not Guilty, would be triable by the Jury under Instructions by the Court. The defendants may wish to a void this, and to bring the ques tion up for decision by the Court, instead of by the Jury. They can do this if they cam set forth their Title Specially in their Plea, for then the plaintiff, if disposed to question the sufficiency of the title, may Demur to"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"Page 487 of 735 the Plea, and thus refer the legal question to the Court. But such a Plea, as we have seen, if Pleaded simply according to the fact, would be bad for Want of Color. This difficulty was overcome by the practice of giving Ex - press Color to the Plea in lie u of the Implied Color which was wanting. It is done by in serting in the Plea a Fictitious Allegation of some Colorable but Insufficient Title in the plaintiff, which was at the same time avoid ed by showing the Preferable Title of the - defendant. This was called “Giving Color,” and it was held to cure or prevent the objec tion which would otherwise arise from the want of Implied Color. Such a Plea Con - . teased some apparent title in the plaintiff, as a demise under which he entered and was possessed, and t herefore admits that the close was in some sense the close of the plain - tiff, but at the same time it avoids this col orable title by showing that of the defend ant, and alleging that the plaintiff’s title un der the demise was defective in Point of Law, a nd that nothing passed under the de mise. Sec. 228 PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 465 When Express Color was thus given, the plaintiff was not allowed, In his Replication, to Traverse the Fictitious Matter suggested by Way of Color; for, its only object being to prevent a difficulty in Form, such Tra verse would be wholly foreign to the merits of the cause, and would only serve to frus trate the Fiction which the Law, in such case, allows. The plaintiff would therefore pass over the Color without notice, and wo uld either Traverse the title of the defendant, if he meant to contest its truth in Point of Fact, or Demur to it, if lie meant to contest its sufficiency in Point of Law; and thus the defendant would obtain his object of bring ing any legal question raised upon his title under consideration of the Court, and with drawing it from the Jury. Express Color must consist of such mat ter as, if it were effectual, would maintain the nature of the action.~ On the other hand, the right s uggested must be colorable only, and must not amount to a real or actu al right; for otherwise the plaintiff would be entitled to recover on the defendant’s own showing, and the Plea would be an insuffi cient answer.° 1 PLEADINGS IN ESTOPPEL 227. A Plea i n Estoppel is one which neither Confesses nor Avoids, but Pleads a previous inconsistent Act, Aliegation, or Denial of the Party which precludes him from maintaining his Action or Defense. A MAN is sometimes precluded in law from alleging or denying a fac t in conse quence of his own previous Act, Allegation, or Denial of a contrary tenor; and this pre clusion is called an Estoppel. An Estoppel may arise either from Matter of Record, — from the deed of the party, — or from Matter in Pals, that is, matter of fa ct. Thus, any 90. Comyns, Digest of the Laws of England, “Plead er,” 3, M. 41 (New York, 1825). Di. Radford v. Harbyn, Cro.Jac. 122, 79 Eng.Rep. 106 matter adjudicated in a Court of Record will forever preclude the party from afterwards contesting the same fact in a subsequent suit with his adversary. This is an Estoppel by Matter of Record. As an instance of an Es~ toppel by Deed may be mentioned the case of a bond reciting a certain fact. The party executing the bond will be precluded from afterwards denying, in any action brought upon that instrument, the fact so recited. An example of an Estoppal by Matter in Pais occurs when one man has accepted re nt of another. He will be estopped from after wards denying, in any action with that per son, that he was at the time of such accept ance his tenant. The tenant is likewise es topped to deny his landlord’s title. This doctrine of law gives rise to a Kind of Pleading that is neither by Way of Tra verse nor Confession and Avoidance, viz.: a Pleading that, waiving any Question on the Fact, relies merely on the Estoppel; and, after stating the previous Act, Allegation, or Denial on the Opposite Party, Prays Ju dg ment if he shall be received or admitted to aver contrary to what he before did or said.°~ This is called a Pleading by Way of Estoppel. It may be interposed instead of a Traverse, without admitting Traversable Averments on the other sideY 3 ADMISSION B Y FAILURE TO DENY"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"Page 488 of 735 228.

So, in an Action of Covenant on an indenture of lease, for failure to repair, a Plea Traversing the want of repair admits the indenture.

A Traversable Fact in Pleading may be passed over without Traverse, and the right to contest it in another action preserved by a Protestation in the Pleading in the present action. A Protestation has no effect in the existing suit. Now that several Pleas may he used, there is l ittle, if any, need for Protesta tion."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"Page 489 of 735 THE practice of Protestation of Facts not Denied arose where the Pleader, wishing to avail himself of the right to contest in a fu ture action some Traversable Fact in the pending action, passes it by without Tra ver se, but at the same time makes a declara tion collateral or incidental to his main Pleading, importing that the Fact so passed over is untrue. The necessity for this arose from the Rule that Pleadings must not be double, and that Every Pleading is taken to Admit such Matters as it does not Traverse. 97 Such being its only purpose, it is wholly without effect in the action in which it oc curs, as, notwithstanding its use, every Trav ersable Fact not Traversed is taken as Ad mitted in the existing suit. Now th at Sev eral Pleas may be employed, there seems no reason for not denying every Allegation that one does not wish to admit, and no occasion for Protestation. Suppose, in an Action of Assumpsit for goods sold, the defendant Pleads that he gave the plaintiff certain goods in full satisfaction and Discharge, etc., and that the plaintiff ac cepted them in full satisfaction and Dis charge; and the plaintiff, while Traversing the acceptance, does not wish to admit the delivery of the goods to him, lest the deliv 91.

This practice was abolished by a rule of Ililary Term and the admission ceased to be conclusive in subse quent actions. PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR ery; even though not accepted, might be come the subject of dispute in some subse quent action. To accomplish this purpose he takes the delivery by Protestation, and Trav erses the acceptance, in his Replication, thus: “And the said .4.3. says, that by rea son of anything in the said Plea allege d, he ought not to be barred from having and main taining his aforesaid action against the said C.D., because, Protesting that the said O.D. did not give or deliver to him, the said .4.3., the said goods as the said C.D. hath above in Pleading alleged, for Replication, never theless, in this behalf, the said .4.3. says that he, the said .4.3., did not accept the said goods in full satisfaction and Discharge of the said Promises and Undertakings, and of all Damages accrued to the said .4.3. by rea son of the Nonperformance thereof, in Man ner and Form as the said C.D. hath above alleged; and this the said .4.3. Prays may be inquired of by the country.” As stated above, the only object and effect of the Protestation is to allow the party to pass by a Fact wit hout Traversing it, and without precluding himself from disputing it in another suit. It is wholly without effect in the action in which it occurs. Under the Rule already laid down, every Traversable Fact not Traversed is, notwithstanding the Protestation, to be taken as admitted in the existing suit.° 5 It is also given as a Rule, that if upon the Traverse the Issue is found against the Party Protesting the Protestation does not avail; and that it is of no use except in the event of the Issue being determi ned in his favor; with this Exception, however, that if the Matter taken by Protestation be such as the Pleader could not have taken Issue upon, the Protestation in that case shall avail, even e~.

As a Pleading is a Statement of the op erative Facts which constitute the Plaintiff’s Cause of Action or the Defendant’s Defense, and not of evidence or argument, it must set forth its Allegations of Fact in a Direct and Positive Form, and not leave them to be col lected by Inference and argument only. IT is a branch of this Rule that Two Af fir matives do not make a Good Negative; nor Two Negatives a Good"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"Page 490 of 735 Affirmative. The reason for this Rule is that not only must pre cision be observed in Allegations of Material Facts, but the Adverse Party must be enabled to Traverse such Allegations by a Direc t and Distinct Denial. Thus, for example, if a defendant, instead of Pleading Performance of a Covenant Gen erally or Specially, as might be proper, al leges simply that he has not broken his cove nant, he leaves the Fact of Performance to be inferred fro m that of the covenants not being broken, so that the Former Fact can not be directly put in Issue by a Traverse of the Plea; and the Plea is therefore bad. 1 In an Action of Trover for ten pieces of money the defendant Pleaded that there was a wager betwe en the plaintiff and one C con cerning the quantity of yards of velvet in a cloak, and the plaintiff and C each delivered into the defendant’s hand ten pieces of money, to be delivered to C if there were ten yards of velvet in the cloak, and if not, to the 9~. i~&Jj,p v.

On the subject of argumentativeness, see the ease of Moses v. Allen, 01 Md. 42, 50, 46 A. 323 (1900), in which the Flea set forth reasons which properly were Matters of Evhlence, and hence could not be traversed except by a replication of the same faulty character. The D emurrer, therofore, was properly sustained. Sec. 230 467 plaintiff; and proceeded to allege that, upon measuring of the cloak, it was found that there were ten yards of velvet therein, where upon the defendant delivered the pieces of money to C. Upon Demurrer, Gawdy held the Plea to be good enough, “for the measur ing thereof is the fittest way for the trying it: and when it is so found by the measuring, he had good cause to deliver them out of his hands to him who had won the wager. But Fenner an d Popham held, that the Plea was not good: for it may be that the measuring was false, and therefore he ought to have Averred in fact, that there were ten yards, and that it was so found upon tile measuring thereof.” 2 So, in an Action of Trespass, for ta king and carrying away the plaintiff’s goods, the defendant Pleaded that the plaintiff never had any goods. “This is an infallible argu ment that the defendant is Not Guilty, and yet it is no Plea.” ~‘ Again, in Ejectment, the defendant Plead ed a surrender of a copyhold by the hand of Fosset, then Steward of the Manor. The plaintiff Traversed that Fosset was Steward. All the Court held this to be No Issue, and that the Traverse ought to be that he did not surrender; for if he were not Steward, the surrender is void. 4 The reason of this 2. Ledesham v. Lubram, Cro.Eliz. 870, 78 Eng.Itep. 1096 (1602). decision appears to be that to Deny that Fos set was Steward could be only so far Material as it tended to show that the surrender was a nullity; a nd that it was, therefoi?e, an Ar gumentative Denial of the surrender, which, if intended to be Traversed, ought to be Traversed in a Direct Form. It is a Branch of this Rule that Two Af firmatives do not make a Good Issue. 5 The reason is that the Travers e by the Second Af firmative is Argumentative in its nature. Thus, if it be alleged by the defendant that a Party died seised in fee, and the Plaintiff al leged that he died seised in tail, this is not a Good Issue; ~ because the Latter Allega. tion amount s to a Denial of a seisin in fee, but denies it by Argument or Inference only. It is this Branch of the Rule against Argu mentativeness that gave rise to the Form of a Special Traverse. Where, for any of the reasons mentioned in a preceding part of this wo rk, it became expedient for a Party Trav ersing to set forth New Affirmative Matter tending to explain or qualify his Denial, he is allowed to do so; but as this, standing alone, will render his Pleading Argumenta tive, he is required to add to his Affirma tive Allegation an Express Denial, which is held to cure or prevent the Argumentativeness. 7 Thus, in the example last given, the plaintiff (1827); New Hampshire: Watriss v.

Thus, in Debt on a lease for years, where the de fendant Pleaded that the plaintiff had noth ing at the time of the lease made, and the plaintiff Repli ed that he was seised in fee, this was held a Good Issue. 9 Another Branch of the Rule against Argu mentativeness is that Two Negatives do not make a Good Issue.’° Thus, if the defendant Plead that he requested the plaintiff to de liver an abstract of his title, but that the plaintiff did not, when so requested, deliver such abstract, but neglected so to do, the plaintiff cannot Reply that he did not neglect and refuse to deliver such abstract, but should Allege Affirmatively that he did de liver. 1 ’ PLEAS AMOUNTING TO THE GENERAL ISSUE 231. Where a Plea amounts to the General Issue, it should be so Pleaded. In other words, where the Matter of Defense may be raised un der the General Issue in the Particular Ac tion involved, it must be so Pleaded.

The point has been frequently urged with success that a Special Plea amounted to the General Issue.’ 2 If the General Issue can be used, then it must be used, and to employ a Specific Denial would be Bad in Form. Thus, even if the defendant wishes to Deny one of Several Material Elements making up the Cause of Action, thereby narrowing the issues of Fact, he is not allowed to do so. The reason or purpose of insisting upon the General Issue seems to have been that of avoiding making of Long Records and of Closing the Pleadings at an Early Stage.’ 3 12.

This abuse has been remedied to some extent under Modern Statutory Systems.’ 4 The following cases illustrate the General Rule: In an Action of Trespass for entering the plaintiff’s garden, the defendant Pleaded that the plaintiff had no such garden. This was Ruled to be No Plea, as it amounted to nothing more than “Not Guilty”; for, if he had no such garden, then the defendant was Not Guilty. So the defendant withdrew his Plea, and said, “Not Guilty.” 15 So, in Trespass for Depasturing the plain tiff’s herbage, “Non depascit herbas” is No Plea; it should be “Not Guilty” 16 So, in Debt for the price of a horse sold, that the defendant did not buy is No Plea, for it am ounts to Nil Debet.’ 7 Again, in Trespass for entering the plain tiff’s house and keeping possession thereof for a certain time, the defendant Pleaded that J.S. was seised in fee thereof, and, being so seised, gave License to the defendant to"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"Page 493 of 735 Pleading, an d tend, not only to destroy the settled distinctions between the different species of pleas, but also to the introduction of New Pleas, unknown to the Law.” Gould, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading, Pt.

This was held bad, as amount ing to Non Est Facttcm.°’ These examples show that a Special Plea thus improperly substituted for the General Issue may be sometimes in a Negative, some times in an Affirmative Form. When in the Negative, its Argumentativeness will often serve as an additional test of its faulty quali ty. Thus, the Plea in the first example, “that iS.

Sec. 231 PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 471 the plaintiff had no such garden,” is evident ly but an Argumentative Allegation that the defendant did not commit, because he could not have committed, the trespass. This, how ever, does not universally hold; for in the second and third examples the Allegations that the defendant “did not depasture,” and “did not buy,” seem to be in as Direct a Form of Denial as that of Not Guilty. If the Plea be in the Affirmative, the following consid erations will always tend to detect the im proper construction: If a Good Plea, it must, as heretofore shown, be taken either as a Traverse or as in Confession and Avoida nce. Now, taken as a Traverse, such a Plea is clearly open to the Objection of Argumen - tativeness; for as we have seen, Two Af firmatives make an Argumentative Issue. Thus, in the fourth example, the Allegations show that the house in question was the hous e of J.B., and they therefore Deny Ar gumentatively that it was the house of the plaintiff as stated in the Declaration. On the other hand, if a Plea of this kind be intended by Way of Confession and Avoidance, it is bad for Want of Color, for it admits no ap parent right in the plaintiff. Thus, in the same example, if it be true that J.S. was seised in fee and gave License to the defend ant to enter, who entered accordingly, this excludes all title of possession in the plain tiff, and without such title he has No Color to maintain"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"Page 494 of 735 an Action of Trespass. 22 So, in the example where the defendant Pleads the plaintiff’s own demise, the same observation applies; for if the plaintiff demised to the de fendant, who entered accordingly, the plain tiff would then ce ase to have any title of pos session, and he consequently has No Color to support an Action of Trespass. The fault of Wanting Color being in this manner connected with that of amounting to The General Issue, it is accordingly held that a Plea will be save d from the latter fault where Express Color is given, 23 Thus, in the example of Express Color given, in a former part of this work, the Plea is cured, by the Fictitious Color of Title there given to the plaintiff, of the objection to which it would otherwi se be sub ject — that it amounts to Not Guilty. So, where sufficient Implied Color is given, a Plea will never be open to this kind of objection. And it is further to be observed that, where sufficient Implied Color is given, the Plea will be equally clear o f this objection, even though it consist of matter which might be given in evidence under the General Issue. Defendants are allowed, in certain actions, to prove, under this Issue, matters in the Na ture of Confession and Avoidance, as, for example, in Ass umpsit, a Release or Pay ment. In such cases the plaintiff, though al lowed, is not obliged, to Plead Non Assump sit, but may, if he pleases, Plead Specially the Payment or Release; and, if he does, such Plea is not open to the objection that it amounts to the General Issue. 24 It is said that the Court is not bound to allow this objection, but that it is in its dis cretion to allow a Special Plea amounting to the General Issue, if it involve such Matter of Law as might be unfit for the decision of a Jury. 2~ It is also said that, as the Court has such discretion, the proper method of taking advantage of this fault is not by Demurrer, 23.

The objection may and must be raised eit her by Motion or Special Demur rer. 27 As a Plea amounting to the General Issue is usually open also to the objection of being Argumentative, or that of Wanting Color, we sometimes find the Rule in question discussed as if it were founded entirely in a view to those objections. This, however, says Ste phen, does not seem to be a sufficiently wide foundation for the. Rule; for there are in stances of Pleas which are faulty, as amount ing to the General Issue, which yet do not seem fairly open to the obj ection of Argu mentativeness, and which, on the other hand, being of the Negative Kind or by way of Traverse, require No Color. Besides, there is Express Authority for holding that the true object of this Rule is to avoid prolixity, for it is laid down tha t “the reason of press ing a General Issue is not for Insufficiency of the Plea, but not to make Long Records when “there is no cause.” 28 PARTIAL DEFENSES 232.

If it fails in this, it is bad. 2 ° Thus, in Trespass for breaking a close and cutting down 300 trees, if the defendant Pleads some Matter of Justification or title as to all but 200 trees, and says nothing as to the 200, his Plea is bad. As to the proper course for the plaintiff to take in such cases there is some doubt, and a conflict in the authorities. It is said by Stephen that there is a distinction in a case where the defendant does not Profess to An swer the Whole, and a case where, by the Commencement of his Plea, he does Profess to do so, but in fact gives a Defective and Partial Answer, applying to part only. He says that in the former case, that is, where the defendant does not Profess to Answer the Whole, the plaintiff is entitled to sign Judgment as by Ni?

Martin, 1 Le v. 48, 83 Eng.Rep. 291 charge, and not to deliberate, yet, as he had not Pleaded separately, but had joined in A.’s Justification, the Plea was bad as to him also? 8 This Rule seems to result from that which requires each Pleading to have its proper Formal Commencement and Conclusion; for by those Forms, it will be observed, the Mat ter which any Pleading contains is offered as an Entire Answer to the Whole of that which last preceded. Thus, in the first example above given, the defendant would allege, in t he Commencement of his Plea, that the plaintiff “ought not to have or maintain his action” for the reason therein assigned; and therefore he would Pray Judgment, etc., as to the Whole Action in the Conclusion. If, therefore, the answer be insufficient as t o One Count, it cannot avail as to the other; because, if taken as a Plea to the latter only, the Commencement and Conclusion would be wrong. It is to be observed that there is but One Plea, and consequently but One Com mencement and Conclusion; but if the de fendants should Plead the Statute in Bar to the First Count separately, and then Plead it to the Second Count with a New Commence ment and Conclusion, thus making Two pleas instead of One, the invalidity of One of th ese Pleas could not vitiate the other. As the Declaration, like the General Issue, has neither Formal Commencement nor Con clusion of the kind to which the last Rule relates, it does not fall within the scope of the one under consideration. A Declaration may be Good in Part, and Bad as to Another Part, relating to a distinct demand divisible from the rest; and if the defendant Plead to the Whole, instead of to the Defective Part Only, the Judgment will be for the plaintiff. 39 38.

Singleness of issue IT was the avowed object of Common - Law Pleading to reduce the controversy of the parties to a Single Material Issue decisive of the case. If a defendant had Several De fenses, the Common L aw required him to make his Election between them and rest his one selected. In Whitaker v. Chief Justice Marshall says: “The principle in Pleading that a Special Plea must Confess and Avoid the fact charged in the Declaration was introduced at a time when the Rigid Practice of the Courts re quired that every cause should be placed on a Single Point, and when it was deemed error to Plead Specially Matter which Amounted to the General Issue; it was not allowed to Deny the Fact and also to Justify it. The def endant might select his Point of Defense; but, when selected, he was confined to it. That a Single Point might be presented to the Jury, he was under the necessity of Con fessing everything but that point. The at tention of the Jury was not directed to Mul tifarious Objects, but confined to one on which alone the cause depended.” ~ The Rule is well settled that No Plea or Traverse can be good which embraces Dif ferent Matters, which cannot be brought within the scope of One Issue. 43 A Plea or 4’. Whitaker v. Freeman, 12 N.C. 271, Fed.Cas.No. 17,527a, 29 FeciCas. 955 (C.C.1S27). 42. Originally, at Common Law, the plaintiff was al lowed to plead only One Plea in Bar, as the great aim of Pleading n - as to reduce the controversy to a Single, Clear - Cut, Well - De fined Issue for the Jury, and thereby simplify the Investigation. By use of the various General Issues, Singleness of the Issue early became a fiction, since the Issue, though ap parently single in words, was in reality Complex. 43. Comyn, Digest, Pleader, E. 2 (London, 1522). Every Plea must be Simple, Entire, Connected, and Confined to a Single Point, and a Ploa sotting up more than one lndcpcndent fact or set of facts, ei ther of which ts sufficient answer, Is bad for du plicity, whether the Plea Is in Bar, In Abatement, 475 case on the Freeman, 4 ’ 476 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS CIt 22 Replication, therefore, must contain but One Complete Answer to the last Opposing Plead ing, the principle being that, as One such An Swer, if maintained, is sufficient to defeat the Action or Defense, all others are superflu ous. 44 It is not necessary, however, that the Single Ground of Defense or Answer to which each Flea or Replication is thus"},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"Page 499 of 735 limited shall consist of a Single Fact, 45 since several con nected or dependent Facts or circumstances may be necessary to constitute a Single or Complete Answer. In such a case the fault of Duplicity cannot exist, as such Facts con - stitute, in fact, but a Single Answer. 4 ° The Rule against Dupli city in the Plea does not prevent a defendant from giving Several Distinct Answers to Different Mat ters of Claim in the Declaration. A defend ant may therefore Plead the General Issue to One Part of the Declaration, and Matter in Confession and Avoidance to the residue, or One Matter of Abatement to One Part, and ‘N or Both.

Another to Another Part, or may Plead in Abatement to One Part of the Demand, and in Bar as to Another.~’ To Several Counts, or to distinct parts of the Same Count, he may therefore Plead Several Pleas; that is, one to each. Thus, in an Action of trespass for three assaults and batteries, the defendant may Plead Not Guilty to the First Count; in Ex cuse — Self - Defense -- — to the Second; and the Statute of Limitations to the Third. The reason is that the Different Matters so Plead ed are not alleged to the Same Point, and therefore do not tend to produce Several Is sues as to that point.~ The Rule applies equally to the Replication and Other Subse quent Pleadings in the series, a severance be ing always proper when there are Several Subjects of Claim or Complaint. This right, however, of thus Pleading Distinct Ma tters, appears to be subject to the restriction that neither of the Separate Defenses thus alleged can be such as would alone constitute a suffi cient Answer to the Whole of the Opposing Claim, since then one only would be neces sary. 49 It may often happen that the defendant may have Several Distinct Answers to give to the Same Claim or Complaint. Thus, in an Action of Trespass for two assaults and batteries, he may have ground to Deny both the trespasses, and also to allege that neither of them was committed within the period of the Statute of Limitations.

Sec. 234 PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 477 presently notice, it was not competent for him to thus Plead Several Answers to the Same Claim, as that would have been an in fringement of the Rule against Duplicity. 50 He was therefore obliged to Elect between his Different Defenses, Where more than one thus happened to present themselves, and to rely on that which, in Point of Law and Fact, he might deem best. But as a mistake in that selection might occasion the loss of the cause, contrary to the real merits of t he case, this restriction against the use of Several Pleas to the same matter, after being for ages ob served in its original severity, was at length considered as contrary to the true principles of justice. The Rule was changed by the Statute of 4 Anne, c. 16, § 4, 11 Statutes at Large 156 (1705). That section provides that “it shall and may be lawful for any defendant or ten ant In any Action or Suit, or for any plaintiff in Replevin, in any Court of Record, with the leave of the same Court, to Plead as Many Several Matters thereto as he shall think nec essary for his Defense,” This statute is old enough to have become a part of our Com mon Law, but in most states substantially the same provision has been expressly enacted. Since this Act the course has b een for the defendant, if he wishes to Plead Several Mat ters to the same Subject of Demand or Com plaint, to apply previously I or a Rule of Court permitting him to do so; and upon this a Rule is accordingly drawn up for That pur pose. 5 ’ When Several Pleas are Pleaded, either to Different Matters, or, by virtue of the Stat ute, to the Same Matter, the plaintiff may, according to the nature of his case, either Demur to the Whole, or Demur to One Plea M.

C. 1875). and Reply to the Other, or make a Sev eral Replication to each Plea; and in the Two Latter cases the result may be a correspond ing Severance in the Subsequent Pleadings, and the Production of Several Issues. But, whether One or More Issues be produced, if the decision, whether in Law or Fact, be in the defendant’s favor, as to any One or More Pleas, he is entitled to Judgment, though he fail as to the remainder; that is, he is entitled to Judgment in respect of that Subject of Demand or Complaint to which the successful Plea relates, and, if i t were Plead ed to the Whole Declaration, to Judgment generally, though the plaintiff should suc ceed as to all the Other Pleas. By a relaxation similar to that which has obtained with respect to Several Counts, the use of Several Pleas, though presumably in tended by the Statute to be allowed only in a case where there are really Several Grounds of Defense, 52 is, in practice, carried much fur ther. For it was soon found that, when there was a Matter of Defense by Way of Special Plea, it was generally expe dient to Plead that Matter in company with the General Issue, whether there were any real ground £ or de nying the Declaration or not; because the effect of this is to put the plaintiff to the Proof of his Declaration before it can become necessary for the defendant to establish his Special Plea; and thus the defendant has the chance of succeeding, not only on the strength of his own case, but by the failure of the plaintiff’s Proof. Again, as the plain tiff, in the case of Several Counts, finds it convenie nt to vary the Mode of Stating the Same Subject of Claim, so, for similar rea sons, defendants were led, under Color of Pleading Distinct Matters of Defense, to state variously, in Various Pleas, the Same De fense; and this either by presenting it in an en tirely new view, or by omitting in One Plea some circumstances alleged in Another.

The legislat ive provision allow ing Several Matters of Plea was confined to that case, under the impression, probably, that it was in that Part of the Pleading that the hardship of the Rule Against Duplicity was most seriously and frequenUy felt, and that the Multipli city of Issues which would be occasioned by a further extension of the enactment would have been attended with expense and inconvenience more than equiva lent to the advantage.

For example, it empowers a defendant to Plead to a Declaration in Assumpsit for goods sold and delivered (1) the General Issue; (2) that the cause of action did not accrue within six years; (3) that he was an infant at the time of the contract. On the First Plea the pl aintiff has only to Join Issue, but with respect to each of the Two Last he may have Several Answers to give. The case may be such as to afford either of these Replica tions to the Statute of Limitations, namely, that the cause of action did accrue within six years, or that at the time the cause of action accrued he was beyond sea, and that he commenced his Suit within six years after his return. So, to the Plea of Infancy, he may have ground for Replying, either that the defendant was not an infant, or tha t the goods for which the action is brought were necessaries suitable to the defendant’s con dition in life. Yet, though the defendant had 57 - But compare Priest v. Dodsworth, 235 Ri. 612, 619, 85 NE. 040, 942 (1005). the advantage of his Three Pleas cumulative ly, the plaintiff is obliged to make his Elec tion between these Several Answers, and can Reply but one of them to each Plea. It is also to be observed that the power of Pleading Several Matters extends to Pleas in Bar only, and not to those of the Dilatory Class, with respect to which the leave of the Court will not be granted.r~ Again, it is to be remarked that the Statute does not operate as a total abrogation, even with respect to pleas in Bar, of the Rule a gainst Duplicity. For, first, it is necessary, as we have seen, to obtain the leave of the Court to make use of Several Matters of De fense, the application for leave being ad dressed to the discretion of the Court, 5 ° and then the Several Matters are Plead ed For mally, with the words, “by leave of the Court for this purpose first had and obtained.” The Several Defenses must also each be Pleaded as a New or Further Plea, with a Formal Commencement and Conclusion as such; so that, notwithstanding the Statute, and the leave of the court obtained in pursuance of it, to Plead Several Matters, it would still be improper to incorporate several matters in One Plea in any case in which the Plea would be thereby rendered Double at Common Law.°° As the Several Counts in the Declaration are required, apparently at least, to be dis tinct and complete Statements of Separate 5S.

A Pleading which Contains Several Answers, whatever their Class or Quality, will be Double. THIS Rule rests upon the principle, pre viously stated, that where One of Two or More Facts would constitute a sufficient ground of Defense, only One such Fact sho uld be stated. If, therefore, a Pleading included Several Matters in Abatement or in Bar,° 4 or contained One of each Character, 65 it would be Double, and hence fatal on a Special Demurrer. The same would be true in join ing Several Matters in Confession an d Avoid ance, or Several Answers by Way of Tra verse, or a Traverse with a Plea of the former kind~ 6 DUPLICITY — IMMATERIAL MATTER 236. Matter which is wholly Immaterial cannot operate to snake a Pleading Double. THIS is the result of a General Rule that Surplusage is to be disregarded, Where Mat ter is Pleaded which is wholly foreign to the cause, it is mere Surplusage, and will not therefore render a Pleading objectionable, under the Rule we are considering, even 64.

Such Matter will be rejected as Impertinent 67 and Superfluous, since it re quires no answer, and it therefore cannot oc casion the fault for which all Double Plead ings are objec tionable, that is, a Multiplicity of Issues. 68 Thus, in an Action by the Executors of A on a bond conditioned that the defendant should warrant to A a certain meadow, the defendant Pleaded that the said meadow was copyhold of a certain Manor, and that the re is a Custom within the Manor, that if the customary tenants fall in payment of their rents and services, or commit waste, then the lord for the time being may enter for for feiture; and that the said A, during his life, peaceably enjoyed the meadow, whi ch de scended after his death to one B, his son and heir who, by his own wrong, entered without the admission of the lord, against the Custom of the Manor; and because three shillings of rent were in arrear on such a day, the lord entered into the meadow, as into lands forfeited. On Demurrer, it was objected (among other things) that the Plea was 87. An Impertinent Averment is a statement of mat ter altogether foreign to the Merits of the Cause, and may, therefore, be struck out in its entirety, without in jury to the pleading, and, of course, no proof of such an Allegation can be required; on fhe other hand, an immaterial Ave,ment must, in many cases, be proved, and is a statement of unnecessary particulars in connection with, and as descriptive of, What Is material.

Double; because in showing the forfeiture to have accrued by the heir’s own wrongful act, Two Several Matters are alleged: Ffrst, that he entered without admission, against the custom; secondly, that three shillings of rent were in arrear. But the Jud ges held that the only sufficient cause of forfeiture was the nonpayment of rent; that, there being No Custom alleged for forfeiture in respect of entry without admission, the Aver ment of such Entry was mere Surplusage and could not, therefore, avail to m ake the Plea Double. 69 It is, however, to be observed that the Plea seems to rely on the nonpayment of the rent as the only ground of forfeiture, for it alleges that “because three shillings of the rent were in arrear, the lord entered,” and the Court noti ced this circumstance. The case, therefore, does not explicitly decide that where Two Several Matters are not only Pleaded, but relied upon, the Immateriality of one of them shall prevent Duplicity, but the manner in which the Judges express themselves see ms to show that the doctrine goes to that extent; and there are other au thorities who take the same view. 70 DUPLICITY — MATTER ILL PLEADED 237. Material Matter, though Ill Pleaded, will occasion the Fault of Duplicity. ALTHOUGH Immaterial Matter is to be disregarded, that which is Material to the cause of Action or Defense, though stated in an insufficient manner, will render the Plead ing open to objection as Double, when Plead ed in connection with other Issuable Facts. Such Matter cannot be treated as S urplusage, and, being Material, is therefore, Issuable though defectively alleged. It can neither be rejected as Superfluous, nor does it render the Plea void. It may, therefore, be stated that any Matter which, if Well Pleaded, 69. Executors of Grenelife, 1 Dyer 4 2 a, 73 Eng.Rep. 01 (1538)~ ‘70.

That object i s the avoid ance of Several Issues. So, whether a Mat ter be Well or Ill Pleaded, yet if it be suffi ~ient in Substance, as to make it possible for the opposite party to take Issue upon it, if he chooses to Plead Over, without pressing the Formal Objection , such Matter tends to the Production of a Separate Issue, and is on that ground held to make the Pleading Double. On the other hand, if the matter be Imma terial, no Issue can properly be taken upon it. It does not, therefore, tend to a Separate Issue, no r, consequently, fall within the Rule against Duplicity. DUPLICITY — MATTERS FORMING A CONNECTED PROPOSITION 238. No Number of Circumstances, however multifarious, that together constitute but One 71. See Bleeke v. Grove, 1 Sid. 175, 82 Eng.Bep. 1040 (1663). fl. 4 Bacon, Abridgment of the Law, ‘Pleas” K. 2 (Dublin, 1786); Bleekc v. Grove, 1 Bid. 175, 82 Eng.Rep. 1040 (1063). Connected Proposition or Entire Point, will operate to make a Pleading Double. THE Rule against Duplicity has been qualified, not only as to Pleadings in Confes sion and Avoidance, but also as to Traverses; and a Party may therefore Deny, as well as Affirm, any Number of Circumstances that together Form but a Single Point or Propo sition. 73 Thus, to an Action of Trespass for Assault and Imprisonment, if the defendant Plead that he arrested the plaintiff on suspicion of felony, he may set forth any Number of Circumstances of suspicion, though each cir cumstance, taken alone, may be sufficient to Justify the arrest; for, all of them, taken to gether, amount to one connected cause of suspicion. 14 And, in an Action of Trespass for breaking the plaintiff’s close and depasturing it with cattle, the defendan t Pleaded a right of com mon in the close for the said cattle, being his own commonable cattle, levant and couchant upon the premises. The plaintiff, in the Rep lication, Traversed “that the cattle were the defendant’s own cattle, and that they were levant and couchant upon the premises, and commonable cattle.” On Demurrer to the Replication for Duplicity, it was objected that 73.

But the Court held that the point of the De fense was that the cattle in question were en titled to common; that this point was Single, though it involved the Three Several Facts that the cattle were the defendant’s own, that they were levant and couehant, and that they were conimonable cattle; that the Rep lication Traversing these Facts, in effect, therefore, only Traversed the Single Point whether the cattle were entitled to common, and was consequently not open to the Objec tion of Duplicity. 75 There is some difficulty in the application of this Rule in establishing a test between those cases in which Several Averments make up a Single Point, and may therefore be Al leged or Traversed together, and those in which each constitutes a Separate Point, though insufficient in itself as a Defense with o ut union with the others. The governing principle seems to be that while each Suc cessive Denial or Allegation in Pleading must contain no Superfluous Matter, and must be limited to what is strictly necessary to con stitute a Good Defense or Reply to the P lead ing it seeks to answer, it may still go as far, and cover as much ground, as may be req uisite to attain that object. Therefore Two Distinct Facts cannot ordinarily be Averred or Denied Together, if the Proof or Disproof of one would be sufficient to defeat or main tain the action. 76 A qualification becomes necessary, however, where a Number of Dif - ferent Facts or Averments relate to one thing, or together make up a Single Proposi tion; and it seems that the Rule above stated will hold where the Averme nt of Several Con nected Facts is necessary to make a Complete Defense, and that under it, where the Denial of any One of Such Facts would not be a Per fect Answer, a Replication will not be Double 7~. Robinson V. Raley, 1 Burr. 316, 97 Eng.Rep. 330 (1757 ). which meets the Averments by Separate De nials of all, or by a Single General Denial. A Traverse thus made is called a “Cumulative Traverse.” The most frequent instance of its use occurs in the Replication Dc Injuria, which alleges that the defendant of his own wrong, and “without the cause alleged,” com mitted the act. This “cause” may consist of Several Connected Circumstances, and the Denial in the Replication is taken as a Trav erse of Each of the Facts stated by Denying the cause which they collecti vely tend to show. 77 There is a restriction upon the use of this Form, however, where the Opposing Allegations include Matter of Title, Author ity, etc., and in such case Matter of that Character must be Denied Separately; or, if the plaintiff wishes to di sregard these and Deny Other Matters in the Plea, such other Matters must be Separately Traversed.78 General Issues as Double Pleas IN some cases the General Issues appear to partake of the Nature of these Cumulative Traverses; for some of them are so framed as to convey a Denial, not of any Particular Fact, but Generally of the Whole Matter alleged, as Not Guilty in Trespass or Tres p ass on the Case, and Nil Debet in Debt. And in Assumpsit the defendant is permit ted, under the General Issue, in that ac~ tion, to avail himself, with some few Excep tions, of any Matter tending to disprove his liability. The consequence is, that under th ese General Issues the defendant has the advantage of disputing, and therefore of put ting the plaintiff to the Proof of every Aver ment in the Declaration. Thus, by Pleading Not Guilty, in Trespass quare clau.sum fregit, he is enabled to Deny, at the Tria l, both that the land was the plaintiff’s and that he corn - 77. O’Brien v.

Indeed, besides this advantage of Double Denial, the defendant obtains, un der the General Issue, in Assumpsit and oth er Actions of Trespass on the Case, the ad vantage of Double Pleading in Confession and Avoidance. For he is allowed, in these actions, to bring forward, upon the General Issue, almost Any Matters, though in the Na ture of Confession and Avoidance, which tend to disprove his debt or liability; so he is not limited, as he would be in Special Pleading, to a reliance on any Single Ma tter of this de scription, but may set up any Number of These Defenses. While such is"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"Page 507 of 735 the effect of many of the General Issues in mitigating or evading the Rule against Duplicity, the re mark does not apply to all. Thus, the general issue of Non Est Factum raises only a Single Question, namely, whether the defendant ex ecuted a valid and genuine deed, such as is alleged in the Declaration. The defendant may, under this Plea, insist that the deed was not executed by him, or that it was executed under circums tances which absolutely annul its effect as a deed, but can set up no other kind of Defense. 7 ° The Replication Dc Injuria is similar to the General Issue in being a General Traverse, which is allowed where an Affirmative De fense is set up by Way of Excus e. Like the General Issue, it is an anomaly and a viola tion of the Rule against Duplicity, since it permits the Party to set up Numerous De fenses by one Plea. DUPLICITY — PROTESTATION 239. A Protestation will not render a Plead ing Double. THE nature of this illogical and unneces sary Form in Pleading has been heretofore explained, and from its nature and object, in being only a collateral objection or reser vation, without effect in the Action in which it is used, it is manifest that it cannot cause Dupl icity. Thus, in the example given on another page, where the defendant Pleads the delivery and acceptance of goods in satisfac tion of the plaintiff’s demand, though the plaintiff cannot Reply that the goods were neither delivered nor accepted in satisfac tion, for this would be Double, yet he may Protest that they were not delivered, and at the same time Deny the acceptance, without incurring the objection. For a Protestation (as already explained) does not Tend to Is sue in the Action, but is made merely to re serve to the party the right of Denying or Alleging the Same Matter in a future suit. It consequently cannot fall within the object of the Rule against Duplicity, which is, to avoid a Plurality of Issues.

Under the Ililary Rules “Not Guilty” operated in trespass quare clausum fregit only as a denial that the defendant committed the trespass alleged in the place mentio ned; and in trespass de bonis asportatis only as a denial of the defendant having committed the trespass alleged by taking or damaging the goods. The Hilary Rules of 1834 restricted the Scope of the General Issue by providing that, in Trespass Quare Claus urn Fregit, the Plea of Not Guilty shall operate as a Denial that the defendant committed the Trespass alleged in the place mentioned, but not as a Denial of the plaintiff’s Possession or Right of Pos session. If this is intended to be Traversed, it must b e by a Specific Traverse. In Trespass Dc Bonis Asportatis, the Plea of Not Guilty operated under the Hilary Rules as a Denial of the defendant having committed the Trespass alleged, by taking or damaging the goods mentioned, but not of plaintiff’ s property therein. To put in Is sue the plaintiff’s Right, the Specific Tray erse “Not Possessed” was used. Prior to these Rules of Court there was no occasion for a Specific Traverse. THE GENERAL ISSUE IN TRESPASS ON THE CASE 244. The Plea of “Not Guilt y” is the proper General Issue in an Action of Trespass on the Case, and is a Formal Denial of Liability, ad mitting almost All Defenses.

THE General Issue in the Acti on of Tres pass on the Case is “Not Guilty,” and the Scope and Effect of this Plea is much broader than in the Action of Trespass Vi Fit Armis, where it operates as a Mere Denial or Trav erse of the Facts alleged. An effect is given it similar to that in t he Action of Assumpsit, by which the defendant may contest under it, not only the truth of the Material Facts al leged in the Declaration, but may also give in evidence any Defense which, as Lord Mans field observed, “would in equity and con science, under the existing circumstances, preclude the plaintiff from recovering, because the plaintiff must recover upon the justice and conscience of his case, and on Sec. 244 PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 489 that only.” ~° The defendant, upon the Gen eral Issue of Not Guilty, not only put the plaintiff upon the Proof of the Whole Charge in the Declaration, including Matters of In ducement, as well as Matters constituting the Gist of the Action, but he might also offer evidence of Defenses going to Disp ute Liabil ity, more popularly known as Affirmative Defenses. And this included Affirmative De fenses in Discharge of the cause of action, as wail as Defenses in JustifIcation and Excuse. The net effect of this departure from the True Principles of Pleadin g, was to permit the defendant, under the General Issue, any Matter of Defense in contravention of the Plaintiff’s Right of Action, even though such matters were strictly the proper subjects of a Plea in Confession and Avoidance of the Declaration; 91 alth ough the defendant could, if he chose, bring forward by Way of a Special Plea all Matters in Confession and Avoidance of the Declaration. Thus, in ef fect, under the General Issue, the defendant’s Defense might be that he did not commit the Wrongful Act co mplained of, or that 90. Bird v. Randall, 3 Burr. 1353, 07 EngRep. 566 (1762).

Thus, if your automobile is damaged and you sue the wrongdoer in Trespass, the Plea of Not Guilty will serve as a Denial of the Facts stated in the Declaration, and no more. Matters of Justification or Excuse, such as the Defenses o f Contributory Negligence, or Leave and License, cannot be proved under this Plea. But if you sue in Case, the defend ant may, under a Plea of Not Guilty, not only put the plaintiff upon Proof of the whole Charge contained in the Declaration, but may offer any Defense in Justification or Excuse, or he may set up a Former Recovery, or a Release, or Discharge. 93 An Action on the Case is said t 0 be in the Nature of a Bill in Equity, and the defendant may prove, under the General Issue in that action, almost any thing, except the Statute of Limitations and Truth in Libel and Slander, which shows that the defendant ought not to recover — an il logical and whimsical reason for slipshod Pleading. 92.

At Common Law, under a Plea of the General Issue in Trespass on the Case, as in Assumpsit, Debt on Simple Contracts, and Trover, most of the Affirmative Defenses may be admitted without being Specially Pleaded. The Two Principal Exceptions are the Defenses of the Statute of Limitations and Truth in Libel and Slander. In general, all matters in Justification and Excuse, or in Discharge of the alleged Right of Action, could be shown under the Geri eral Issue in Case rather than Pleaded Af firmatively in Conf ession and Avoidance. There were Two Principal Exceptions to this Rule, which will be considered shortly — the Statute of Limitations and Truth in Slander and Libel Cases.

If the Stat ute is not Pleaded, the plaintiff is liable to be surprised, and therefore equally unprepared to answer in the one action as in the other. In neither case does the Statute extinguish the debt, but Bars only the Remedy, and it is optional whether the defendant will insist upon the Statute or waive it. If he intends to insist upon it, he should Plead it, to prevent surprise, and if he does not, i t should be pre sumed he intends to waive it. This is the view taken by the late Mr. Serjt. Williams, than whom a sounder lawyer, or more accu rate Special Pleader has rarely done honor to his profession; and he states it to be very usual, and the Modern P ractice, to Plead to Debt on Simple Contract, that the Cause of Action did not accrue within six years, that the plaintiff may Reply, either that he was within the Exceptions in the Statute, or that he has sued out a Writ within time, as is the common ease in Assumpsit,” ~ The real reason, however, why the Statute of Limitations must, in general, be Pleaded Specially, stems from another cause. Any Allegation which the Pleader is not obliged to Prove as he states is Immaterial. Allega tions of this characte r include the specifica tion of time, which in pleading is ordinarily Immaterial, unless the date of a transaction is, for some other reason, Material as to its validity. Such Immaterial Allegations are not admitted by Demurrer.° 9 It follows, therefore, th at the Statement of a Right which appears, according to the date laid for it, to be Barred by the Statute of Lim itations, is not, for this very reason, held to be bad on Demurrer, as the plaintiff, in Stating his Declaration, is not bound by the Allegatio n of a Specific Time. Hence, if the defendant desires to take advantage of the Bar of the Statute of Limitations, he can OS. Chapplo v, Durston, 1 C. & 3. 1, 9, 148 Eng.Rep, 1311, 1314 (1830). ~. Georgia Rome Ins. Co v.

It is reported that this Issue was taken up at a meeting of all the Judges, called to consider a case in volving this Issue which arose in the Court of Common Pleas.

In Trespass on the Case, the General Issue of “Not Guilty” under the Runty Rules operated only as a Denial of the Breach of Duty or Wrongful Act; all other Deenses were required to be Pleaded Specially. THE Scope of the Plea of the General Issue in Trespass on the Case — Not Guilty — was greatly restricted by the Hilary Rules of 1834, Section IV, which provided that “the Plea of Not Guilty shall operate as a denial only of the breach of the duty or wrongful act alleged to have been committed by the defendant, and not of the facts stated in the Inducement; and no other defense than such denial shall be admissible under that Plea; all other Pleas in denial shall take issue on some particular matter of fact alleged in the Declaration.” The term “Inducement”, as used therein, refers to those Facts and Cir cumstances which are required to be Stated in an Action of Trespass on the Case, in order to disclose the plaintiff’s Right as it existed S. Stoevell v. Beagle, 57 Ill. 97 (1870); Dowic V. Pridcile, 216 111. 553, 75 N.E. 243, 3 Ann.Cas. 526 (1905). 6 - Underwood v. Parks, 2 5tr. 1200, 93 Eng.Eep. 1127 (1744). PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR at the time of the defendant’s Wrongful Act. The Plea of the General Issue, after the flu ary Rules, operated to Deny the Wrongful Act of the defendant, and to admit the In ducement, which disclosed the plaintiff’s Right. Under Section TV of the Hulary Rules all Matters in Confession and Av oidance were re quired to be Pleaded Specially, as in Actions of Assurnpsit. The Defenses of the Statute of Limitations and Truth in Defamation were required to be so Pleaded even before the Hilary Rules, as we have previously observed. THE GENERAL ISSUE IN TROVER 247. The General Issue in Trover, as in Trespass and Trespass on the Case, is “Not Guilty,” which is a Formal Denial of the Wrongful Conversion. It denies a Legal Con clusion, and so Admits All Defenses, except Release and the Statute of Limitat ions. FORM OF THE GENERAL ISSUE IN TROvER [Trover: Not Guiltyj In the King’s Bench, Term, William TV C. D, 1 ats. A.B.

Thus, such a Defense as the Bank niptcy of the defendant, may be shown, but neither a Release nor the Bar of the Statute of Limitations may be admitted.’ This lati tude is permissive only, however, and the de - fendant is at liberty to Plead Specially any Defense which admits both the property in the plaintiff and the conversion, but Justifies the latter. 8 PLEAS IN CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE IN TROVER 248. The Defenses of a Release and the Statute of Limitations were required to be Pleaded Specially. AS stated above, in Trover under Not Guilty, the only Defenses which could not be shown were a Release and the Statute of Limitations. THE HILARY RULES — THEIR EFFECT UP ON NEGATIVE AND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES IN TROVER 249. The Effect of the Hilary Rules in Trover was to restrict the General Issue of “Not Guilty” to a Denial of the Wrongful Conver sion only. 7. English: Webb v.

Sec. 249 493 494 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS Cli. 22 AS Trover was in Form an Action on the Case, it fell within the Scope of Section IV of the Hulary Rules. Under the Reforming Rule, the Plea of the General Issue operat ed to Deny the Wrongful Act of the defend ant, and no longer, as at Common Law, De nied the Right in the plaintiff, even though the Facts of Right might, in some degree, constitute a par t of the description of the Wrongful Acts.° In the examples which the authors of the Hilary Rules gave under Sec tion IV, in Paragraph 3, with respect to the Operation of the Rule as to the General Issue in Trover, it was said that “in an action for conver ting the plaintiff’s goods, the conver sion only, and not the plaintiff’s title to the goods,” were in issue under the Plea. According to Chitty 10 and Greenleaf,” only the Conversion in Fact, was in issue, ir respective of its character. Martin, however, states that the decisions have receded from this view, and that the term “Converskm/’ as used in the Rules, means a Wrongful Con version, in the same sense as it did Prior to the Rules, and that there can be no such thung as a Justifiable Conversion.’ 2 A fter the Hilary Rules, under a Plea of the General Issue in Trover, a defendant was per mitted to prove any Defense tending to show that the Act complained of was not Wrong ful, and hence not a Conversion, and, of course,"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"Page 518 of 735 such Plea admitted the plaintiff’s title, which constituted the sole Inducement P.

After the Hilary Rules, in England, the Scope of the Gene ral Issue was greatly restricted, being limited to a De nial of the Wrongful Act of Conversion, hence most Defenses had thereafter to be Pleaded Specially.’ 6 If the plaintiff’s title was to be put in Issu e, the defendant was required to interpose a Specific Traverse of “Not Pos sessed.” In general, it has usually been said, that in the Several States of the United States, the Rules as they existed in England prior to 1834, or at Common Law, are followed. TUE GENERAL ISSUE IN EJECTMENT 250. The General Issue in Ejeetment is “Not Guilty,” which permits all Defenses, Affirma tive as well as Negative, to be shown. Equita ble Defenses are still not allowed in sonic jurisdictions. FORM OF THE GENERAL ISSUE IN EJECTMENT [Ejcctment: Not Guilty] In the King’s Bench, Term, William IV C. D. ats. ANTi) the said C.

But in time the Scope of “Not Guilty” was re stricted by the Common Consent Rule, under which the Actual Tenant, as a condition of being substituted in place of the Casual Ejec tor, was compelled to admit the Entry, the Lease and the O uster, leaving in Issue only Title. As a result of the development of the Ac tion, the General Issue in Ejectment — ”Not Guilty” — operates as follows: (1) As a De nial of the Unlawfulness of the withholding, that is, of the Plaintiff’s Title and Right to Pos session; (2) All Defenses in Excuse or Discharge, including the Statute of Limita tions, are available. 17 Specific Traverse THE defendant, under the General Issue, cannot be heard to dispute that he held 17.

In Illinois, the defendant would Deny by a Special Plea, Verified by Affidavit, that he was in possession or claims any inter est or title in the premises, or that a ny de mand of possession was made. 15 PLEAS IN CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE IN EJECTMENT 251. In Ejectment, as Affirmative Defenses are admissible under the General Issue, it is not proper to Plead them Specially. Equitable Defenses are not allowed in Ejectme nt. AFFIRMATIVE Defenses are wholly im proper in Ejectment, as these Matters are available under the General Issue,’° nor are Equitable Defenses 20 permitted in Eject ment.

It follows, therefore, that an Equitable De fense constituted no Bar to a recovery. Thus, it is no Defense in Ejectment to show that a deed was procured by the plaintiff’s fraud, even though a Court of Equity, on the same showing, might rescind the conveyanceYz Possession of land under a verbal contract, payment of the price, and the mak ing of valu able improvements thereon, will operate to take the case out of the Statute of Frauds in Equity, hut not in a Court of Law, and such facts constitute no Defense to an Action of Ejectnient. The defendant, for relief, must have recourse to a sepa rate proceeding in Equity. 23 - In Illinois, when the distinction between the Common Law and Chancery Courts was being maintained, it was not permissible, in an Action of Ejectment, to attack a deed up on the ground that the grantor was mentally incompeten t to execute the deed, as the remedy in such case is in a Court of Equity. In those states, in which the distinction be tween Common Law and Equity Jurisdiction is not so strictly maintained, the Defense of Incompetency can be raised in an Action of Eject ment. 24 In an Ejectment Action, the Court cannot adjust the equities, if any, be - 21.

Where the Declaration is for the unlawful detention only, the Plea in Denial should be “Non Detinet” or “Non Detinuit ;“ and that would seem on principle to be the Proper Pl ea at the present time, unless in case of an actual wrongful taking, since the gist of the Action is now the Wnngful Detention.

The Pleas of “Non Cepit” and “Non Detinet” thus both concede the Right of Possession to be in the Plaintiff, and only put in Issue the Taking and the Detention, as the case may be. 3 ° By Statute, in Some States, a Plea of “Not Guilty” or other General Issue, is allowed to put in Issue, not only the Wrongful Taking and Detention, but also the Right of the Plaintiff to the Possession of the property claimed, and even Matters in Excuse may be admissible under it. 3 ’ TIlE SPECIAL TRAVERSE IN REPLEVIN 256.

The General Denial in Beplevin under the Codes has a peculiar comprehensiveness and permits almost all Defenses, Affirmative as well as Negative. Note: Pleading — Bep)evin — -- .Wbat Defenses are Provable Under a General Denial, S Minn.L.Rev. 563 (1021); Squire, General Denial in Replevin, 24 Case & Corn monl 21 (1017). A SPECIAL Traverse is the proper Form of Denial of the Right or Title of the Plaintiff in an Action of Replevin. It consists of two parts: (1) An Affirmative Statement by Way of Inducement, setting up the facts and circumstances inconsistent with the Right or Title of the Plaintiff, such as Title in the De fendant or in a Third Person; (2) An Abs que Hoc Cause follows this Argumentative De nial with a Direct Denial of the Plaintiff’s Right. 35 Thus, to illustrate, suppose the plaintiff in Replevin alleges th at the defend ant Wrongfully took his cattle. The defend ant, Pleading an Affirmative Statement by Way of Inducement, would allege “that the cattle were the cattle of X, a stranger.” But Two Affirrnatives do not create an Issue. If, therefore, the defendan t ended his Plea at this point, it would be subject to a Special Demurrer as an Argumentative Denial. To avoid this, the defendant adds his Absqw3 Hoc Clause — and not the cattle of the plain tiff — which turns the Argumentative Denial into a Negative Plea Den ying Title. 3 ° Under a Plea by Way of Special Traverse, the plaintiff had the burden of Proof, and the defendant, if he succeeds, is entitled to a return of the goods, without the necessity of making an Avowry or Cognizance, because the plaintiff must reco ver on the strength of his own title and right to immediate posses sion. 40 38.

TIlE GENERAL ISSUE IN DEBT ON SIMPLE CONTRACTS AND STATUTES 258. The proper General Issue in Debt on Simple Contracts or on Statutes is “Nil Debet,” which is a Formal denial of the Debt.

MARTIN, Civil Procedure at Common Law, Appendix, Form (50) (St. Paul 1905). WHERE the Action of Debt is not found ed on a Record or a Specialty, the General Form of Traverse is “Nil Debet,” meaning that the defendant owes nothing; and it ap plies without regard to whether the debt aris es by the operation of a Statute or by Simple Contract. As “Nil Debet” denied a present existing debt, the Courts gave a very broad construction to it, permitting Defenses which went to show the non - existence of the debt. Th us, for example, where the Declaration in Debt on Simple Contract alleged that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff for goods sold and delivered, to which the de fendant pleaded “Nil Debet”, that is, that “he does not owe the money alleged to be due, ” the Issue on the Pleadings, framed in the present tense, is: Is the defendant pres ently indebted to the plaintiff? Were the Allegation merely “that the goods were not sold and delivered,” it would, of course, be applicable to no case but one where the d e fendant intends to deny the sale and de livery; but, as the Allegation is that he does not owe, it is evident that the Plea is adapted to any kind of Defense that tends to deny an existing debt, and, therefore, not merely, in the case supposed, to a Defe nse consist ing of a Denial of the sale and delivery, but also to the Defenses of Arbitrament, Satisfaction, Release, and a multitude of oth ers, to which a Traverse of a narrower kind would be inapplicable. 4 ’ It has been said that the Defenses of Bankrupt cy, the Stat ute of Limitations and Tender are the only ones which could not be proved under the Plea of Nil Debet. 48 However this may be, it appears that there is hardly any Mat ter of Defense to an Action of Debt to which the Plea of “Nil Debet” is not a pplicable, be cause almost all Defenses resolve themselves into a Denial of the Debt. 49 The Scope of the 47.

The same ef feet was given to this New Form of Flea as to the Plea of “Non Assumpsit” in Indehitatus Assumpsit under the Hilary Rules, and all Matters in Confession and Avoidance wer e to be Specially Pleaded as in the Action of As sump sit. In other Actions of Debt in which the Gen eral Issue of “Nil Debet” had been used, in - eluding those on Bills of Exchange and as of Assumpsit, the same reason to,’ Pleading the Statute applyi’,g e qually to both. If the Statute is not pleaded, the piaintift is liable t 0 be surprised, and therefore equally unprepared to answer in the One Action as jo the Other, In neither ease does the Statute extinguish the Debt, but Bars only the I ti’,nedv, and it is optional whether the defendant will insist upon the Statute or waive it. I - he in tends to insist upon it, he should plead it to pre vent surprise, and if he does not, it should be pre su med lie intends to waive it. Phi is is the view taken by the lat e Mr. Serjt. Williams, than whom a sounder Lawyer, or more accurate pleader has rarely (lone honor te his profession ; and he states It to be very usual, and the modern practice, to plead to debt on Simple Contract, that the Cause of Action did not accrue within six years, that the plaintiff may reply, either that be was within any of the exceptions in the Statute, or that he has sued out a Writ within time, as is the Common Case in Assutupsit.” t2.

In this action, therefore, the defendant must still Plead, as prior to the above Rule, Pay ment at or after the day, Performance of the Condition of the Bond, or any Matter in Ex cuse of Performance, such as Non Damni fi catus [not injured] to a bond of indemnity, and no award to an arbitration bond.

The reason f or this characteristic of the Plea — its narrowness — may be traced to the fact that in ancient times there was no Defense to a Sealed Contract outside of its conditions, except such as had a logi cal tendency to show that it had not been executed, or that the cause had been re leased under seal. Thus, in the early period of the action, Fraud, Want of Consideration, and Release, unless under Seal, constituted No Defense. No Defense in Pais outside of Non - Performance of conditions, except Du ress, would be enter tained. 69 In an Action on a Sealed Contract of Lease, if you sue in Covenant for the rent, the de fendant must Plead to some Particular Allega tion. The Defendant may plead Non Est Factum, yet that only puts the Execution or Validity of the deed in Issue, and not the Breach of the Covenant. If, however, you sue in Debt on the Lease, though it be Sealed, the defendant can Plead the General Issue of Nil Debet, as the Specialty is considered as but the Inducement to the action. In Actions of Debt on the Speci alty itself, the General Is sue is Non Est Factum, as in Covenant. Un der Nil Debet, the defendant may not only put the plaintiff to the necessity of showing the existence of a legal contract, but he may give in evidence the Performance of it, or Mat ter i n Excuse of Performance, or a Re 66.

The Gen eral Rule, if a p arty would avail himself ol the Statute of Frauds as a Defense, is that he must Plead it. The reason for the Rule at Common Law appears obvious, for a Contract is not Absolutely Void, but merely Voidable at the Election of the Party against whom it is to b e enforced. When, therefore, such a Contract is declared upon, if a Party fails to Plead the Statute of Frauds, he will be deemed to have waived it.’ 1 THE RILARY RULES — THEIR EFFECT ON THE SCOPE OF TIlE GENERAL ISSUE IN SPECIAL ASSUMPSIT 271. The Ililary Rules restricted the General Issue in Special Assumpsit to a Denial in Fact of the Promise or Contract Alleged. ANCIENTLY, as we have seen, Mat ters in Discharge of the Action were re quired to be Specially Pleaded. Afterward, a distinction was made betwee n Express and Implied Assurnpsit; in the former, or in Special Assunipsit, they were still required to be Pleaded, but not in the latter — General or Indebitatus Assumpsit. At length, about the time of Lord Holt there was a general relaxation of the earlier view, arid they were 87 - 1 Tidd, Practice of the Courts of King’s Bench in Personal Actions, e.

To permit the de fendant, therefore, to give this in evidence under the Gener al Issue, which is a Plea by Way of Traverse, is to lose sight of the dis tinction between the Two Kinds of Pleading. Under the Hilary Rules, this misapplication and abuse of the General Issue was correct ed. It restricted “Non Assumpsit” to a Denial of t he Contract alleged. It did not Deny the Breach, 92 nor Performance by the plaintiff of a Condition Precedent to his Right to sue, nor Performance by him of a Bilateral contract. These were, under the Hilary Rules, properly the subject of a Com mon or Specific Traverse. In Actions on Bills of Exchange and Prom issory Notes, under the Hilary Rules, the General Issue was not permitted. What was required was a Specific Traverse of some Matter of Fact alleged in the Declaration, such as making, draw ing, indorsing, accept ing, presenting or giving notice.° 3 92. Smith v.

While many Matters in Discharge may be shown under the General Issue in General or Indebitatus Assumpsit, some Defenses, such as Discharge in Bankruptcy, and the Statute of Limitations, must be Specially Pleaded. MANY matters in Discharge, such as Pay ment, Novation, Accord and Satisfaction , Conditions Subsequent, may be shown under the General Issue, with some exceptions, among which are the following: (1) Dis charge in Bankruptcy; (2) Failure and Lack of Consideration of Negotiable Notes, if copy is filed with the Common Counts; °~ (3) In fancy (query); (4) Set - Off; ~ (5) Statute of Limitations; and (6) Usury.

Under the Hilary Rules “Non Assump sit”, in General or Indehitatus Assurnpsit, oper. ated as a Denial of the Matters of Fact from which the Contract or Promise alleged may be Implied by Law. BY the Hilarv Rules of 1834, it was provid ed that “Non Assumpsit”, in General As sunipsit, shall operate only as Denial of the Mat ters of Fact from which the Contract or Promise alleged may be Implied in Law. 94.

O’Halloran, 144 flLApp. 74 (1908). it the Common Counts alone are used, the defendant has no notice describing the instrument relied upon for a recovery, and accordingly, It is held that the defendant cannot be required to set up Defenses such as the Statute of Frauds specially. $6. Kennard v. Secor, 57 IILApp. 415 (1804). And hi compliance with this Rule, it was de clared that in General Assumpsit for goods sold and delivered, or for money had and re ceived, “Non Assuinpsit” was to operate only as a Denial of the sale and delivery, or of th e receipt of the money to the plaintiff’s use.

COMPARISON OF SCOPE OF DIFFERENT GENERAL ISSUES 275. The General Issue has a wide Scope in Case, Trover, Assumpsit, Debt on Simple Con tract, and Ejeetment. It has the effect of a General Denial only in Trespass and Detinue. In other Actions, the General Issue is more in the nature of a Specific Denial than a General Denial. IT has been observed that, at Common Law, by the General Issue in Assumpsit, in Debt on Simple Contract, in Trover, in Case, and in Ejeetment, the defendant puts the plaintiff to the Proof of almost all the ele ments of his cause of action, and at the same time he may prove in his own Defense almost all Matters in Jus tification and Excuse, and most of the matters in Discharge. In Tres pass and Detinue, however, the General Issue is only a Summary Denial of the Material Allegations of the Declaration, and matters in Confession and Avoidance must be Specially Pleaded, an d cannot be admitted under the General Issue. In the Actions of Covenant, Debt on Spe cialty, Debt on Judgment, and Replevin, the General Issue does not perform the function of a General Denial, but rather has the effect of denying only some of the Materi al Allega lions in the Declaration, therefore, in truth, partaking of the characteristics of a Specific Traverse, rather than a General Traverse; Sec. 277 PLEAS — PEREMPTORY OR IN BAR 513 and, in these instances, matters in Confession and Avoidance must be S pecially Pleaded, and cannot be admitted under the General Issue. By the FRIary Rules of 1834, promulgated in England under Stat. 3 and 4 Wm. IV, c. 42, the Scope of the General Issue, as it existed at Common Law, in admitting almost every possible Defens e in certain actions, was lim - ited. The particular object of these Rules was to generally limit, in England, the opera tion or Scope of the General Issue in actions upon Contracts, to a Direct Denial of the Contract, and in Actions for Wrongs, to a Denial only of the Breach of Duty or Wrong ful Act of the defendant, making the defend ant Specifically Traverse or Deny any other Material Fact stated in the Declaration, and Plead Affirmatively all Matters in Confession and Avoidance. NOTICE OF DEFENSES UNDER THE GENERAL ISSUE 276. Statutes sometimes have permitted the setting up of matter in Confession and Avoid ance without a Special Plea at the option of the Pleader, by giving Notice in Writing under the General Issue of the Special Matters intended to be relied on for Defense at the Trial. INSTEAD of developing the Rules of Pleading in the direction of substituting Spe cific Pleas for General Traverses, as was done in England under the FRIary Rules of 1834, the Common - Law Procedure Act of 1852, and later Acts, some American states have gone in the opposite direction. Statutes sometimes have permitted the setting up of matter in Confession and Avoidance without a Special Plea at the option of the Pleader, by giving Notice in Writing under the Gen eral Issue of the Special Matters intended to be relied on for Defense at the Trial, 97 No Issue of Fact or of Law can be raised on a Notice of Special Matter of Defense filed with the General IssueP 8 This Rule was criticized as follows by the Illinois Supreme Court in the case of Hunt v. Weir. 99 “Treat ing the Notice as a Plea, and open to Demur rer, these consequences would be avoided. If a Demurrer be sustained to the Notice, the defendant can Amend it as he can a Defec tive Special Plea, and he is in no danger of being caught in a trap, which, though he may have set himself by his Defective Notice, need not, to advance justice, be suddenly sprung upon him on the Trial of the cause. The quality of the notice is a preliminary matter, and should be determined before the Trial. Like objections to Depositions, they are heard and disposed of before the Trial, and cannot be started for the first time on the Trial.’’ 1 PLEA PUIS DARREIN CONTINUANCE 277. A P lea Puis Darrein Continuance is a Plea by the defendant of Matter of Defense which has arisen since the last"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"Page 540 of 735 Continuance of the cause. Such a Plea waives and supersedes all former Pleas. UNDER the Ancient Law, there were Con tinuances or Adjournments of the proceedings for certain purposes from One Day or one Term to another; and in such cases there was an Entry made on the Record expressing the ground of the Adjournment, and appointing a day for the parties to reappear. In the in tervals between such Con tinuances and the Day appointed, the Parties were out of Court, and therefore not in a situation to Plead. But it sometimes happened that after a Plea had been Pleaded, and while the Parties were out of court, in consequence of such a Con tinuance, a New M atter of Defense arose, 98. Illinois: Burgwin v. Babcock, 11 III. 30 (1849); Bailey v. Valley Nat. Bank, 127 111. 332, 10 N.E. 095 (1889); Michigan: Rosenbury v. Angel!, 6 Mich. 508 (1859). 99. 29 Ill. SB (1862). 1. Id. at 86. 97.

Matter that had happened after the Last Continuance — ”Puis ance.” 2 Darrein Continu Defenses arising after the action has been begun cannot, as a Rule, be shown unde r the General Issue, for the reason that they do not Deny that a cause of action existed at the Commencement of the suit. 3 Such Defenses must be Pleaded either “to the further main tenance of the action,” or, if they do not arise until after Plea, they mus t be Pleaded ‘Puis Darrein Continuance.” ~ But in the Action 2.

It must be certain and definite in every particular, the greatest degree of strictness being required. 6 A Plea Puis Darrein Continuance is a waiver of and substitute for the first Plea, and of the latter no advantage can be taken afterwards. When flied, the Plea, by opera tion of Law, supersedes all other Defenses in the cause, and the Parties proceed to settle after thc Commencement of the Suit and Before Plea, It must be pleaded to the further mainte nance of the Action.

This was so because the early Common Law doctrine was that the only remedy where Cross - Demands existed was for each party to sue separately, 9 The absurdity of this situation became crystal clear in a situation where A sold a thousand bushels of Grad e A wheat to B, but on delivery it turned out to be Grade B wheat, whereupon B refused to pay. When, therefore, A sued B for the purchase price, and B desired to cut down the amount of A’s recovery by asserting his Claim for Damages for Breach of Warranty, it was necessary for him to bring a separate action. However, through a long series of judicial decisions, the Common - Law Doctrine of Re coupment was developed. At first, Recoup ment could be used solely as a Defense to diminish the plaintiff’s recovery. Further more, it was confined to Contract Actions, and to Cross - Demands arising from the very contract sued upon by plaintiff.’ 0 As it evolved, however, Recoupment came to lie for Matters arising from the same transac tion, as well as the same contract.

It Stow v. Yarwood, 2 the Court speaks ol Recoupment as follows: “This Doctrine ol Recoupment tends to promote justice, and U prevent needless litigation. It avoids circuity of action, and multiplicity of suits. It ad justs by one action adverse claims growing out of the same subject - matter. Such claims can generally be much better settled in one proceeding, than in several. It is not nec essary that the opposing claims should be of the same character. ‘ * * A claim orig inating in contract, may be set up against one founded in tort. It is sufficient that the coun ter claims arise out of the same subject - matter, and that they are susceptible of a d justment in one action.” 13 The Doctrine of Set - Off AT Common Law, where Cross - Demands existed, the defendant, until Recoupment was recognized, could not Pray for any Relief in his Pleadin gs. If he had a claim against the plaintiff, he could only set it up in another suit of his own. Although the Doctrine of Set - Off of Mutual Claims had early been rec ognized in Equity, it had not found its way into the Common Law. But in 1729 the doc trine was incorporated into the Common Law by means of the Statute of 2 George 11, c. 22, § 13, 16 Statutes at Large 53 (1729). By this Statute a defendant was allowed in an Action upon a Debt to set up a liquidated demand of his own to counter - balance that of the plaintiff, either in whole or in part 14 12. 14 Ill. 423 (1853). 13, Id. at 426, See, also: Delaware: Houghton & Co.

WHERE a defendant pleads in Confession and Avoidance, at the Replication stage of Pleading the plaintiff may Demur or Plead. If he does not Demur, he may deny or trav erse the truth of the matter alleged in the Plea, either in Whole or in Part, or he may confess and Avoid the Plea. 2 If he decides upon the latter, he must be careful to avoid a Departure, which, in the case of the plaintiff, is an abandonment at a later Stage of Plead ing of the ground on which the plaintiff placed his Cause of Action. li - i case of an Evasive Plea it may be permissable for plain tiff to enter a New Assignment, and, in some cases, he may Reply by showing Matter in Estoppel. To a large degree, the Requisites of a Rep lication resemble those of a Plea, and are, first, that it must Answer so much of the Plea as it professes to Answer; second, that it must not Depart from the Cause of Action 2.

THE REPLICATION DE INJURIA — DEFINI TION, SCOPE ANT? AVAILABILITY 280. In certain Actions, where the defend ant Pleads Matter of Excuse, the plaintiff, in stead of Traversing Specially, is permitted to Reply by a Denial in General and Summary Terms. This Traverse is used only to Deny Matter of Excuse, and occurs only in the Repli cation. Such a Pleading is Known as the Rep lication De Injuria. A REPLICATION DE INJURIA is a com penius Form of Denial which, broadly speak ing, does for the plaintiff at the Replication Stage of Pleading, what a Plea of the General Issue does for the defendant at the Plea Stage of Pleading, that is, it denies all the Material Allegations in the Plea. But in what situa tion is this most technical procedural device used? If we suppose that the defendant’s Plea sets out several Distinct Matters which are essential to constitute his Defense, the General Rule has been, according to the prin ciples so far observed, that the plaintiff, in framing his Reply to such a Plea, was re quired to select one of the several Facts or Matters a lleged and Traverse or Confess and Avoid that Particular Fact or Matter, and, as an incident thereof, admit by implication all the other matters. Thus, for example, in Trespass De Bonis Asportatis for taking goods, conceivably the defendant might Plead tha t the goods in question consisted of a num ber of cases of alcoholic liquor, that the plain tiff was unlawfully in possession of them, having no License to keep such goods and having them f or illegal sale, that the defend ant was an officer having the aut hority to seize liquors unlawfully kept, and that he did seize them for the reason stated, and deliv ered them to the officer appointed by the Law to receive goods so seized. Assuming that the goods were not contraband, that the plaintiff had lawful posses sion of them, that the defendant was not an officer, that he had no authority to seize any goods, and that he used the goods for his own consumption, the plaintiff, at the Replication Stage of Pleading might Reply by Traversing any one of the facts relied upon by the defendant. If, how ever, he undertook to Traverse more than one, or all of these facts, he would be guilty of violating the Rule of Pleading against Du plicity, unless the Common - Law Rule as to Singleness of Fact Denied be changed in such a sit uation. The Common - Law, under such circumstances, did permit the plaintiff to Traverse a Plurality of Matters or Facts con tained in the defendant’s Plea, by Replying that the defendant committed the trespasses stated itt the Declaration, of his own wrong and without such cause as in the plea alleged, Dc lnjurja Sua Pro pr - ta Abs que Tali Ca - usa. Such a Form of Replication, known as a Rep lication Dc Injuria, 3 operates as a Compendi ous Denial of Every Material Fact set out in the Plea, thus creating an Iss ue of Fact, just as the General Issue enabled a defendant to Traverse, at the Plea Stage of the Pleading, all the Material Allegations in the plaintiff’s Declaration. The Replication De Injuria dif fered from a Common Ti - averse, which was a Denial of a Mat erial Allegation of Fact in the Pleader’s Own Language, in that the Rep lication De Injuria was not a Denial in Di rect and Categorical Terms, but rather by a Fixed Form in the Nature of a Blanket Nega tion and in that it operated to put in Issue Not One, but All the Material Facts constitu ting the defendant’s composite Defense. The General Rule as to When the Replication Dc Infuria May be Interposed to a Plea THE Common - Law Rule was that a Repli cation could not be Double or contain Two or More Replies t o the Same Plea. And it 3. Gould, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading, Part UI, Of Pleading, Div. v, Of Pleas to the Ac tion, C. III, Of Traverse, 539 (6th ed, by Will, Al bany, 1909). t20 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS Cli. 23 should be kept in mind that the Statute of Anne, 4 enacted in 1705, which permitted a defendant to Plead Several Defenses, did not extend to Replications, except in the single instance of a Plea in Bar to an Avowry in Re plevin, which is in the Nature of a Replica tion, but which is in reality a Plea, as the Avowry was in reality in the Nature of a Declaration."},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"Page 546 of 735 Where a Plea sets up a series or group of circumstances which together constitute the Defense, the strict Theory of Pleading re quires the plaintiff to select some one of such Several Matters and take Issue upon that Single Specific Allegation alone. The Repli cation De Injuria, like the General Issue, is an instance of Licensed Duplicity, to permit a Denial of Several Matters in one Compen dious Form . Before the enactment of Mod ern Statutes permitting the filing of more than One Replication, the use of the Replica tion De Injuria was of great advantage to the plaintiff as it put the defendant to the Proof of all the Material Allegations in his Plea, in stead of leaving the plaintiff to stand or fall by the Denial of a Single Allegation, the oth ers being admitted by failure to Deny them. 5 As the General Issue was used by a defend ant, so a Replication Dc Injuria was avail able to the plaintiff at the Replication Stage of Pleading. It was said to be a Uniform 4. 4 Anne, c. 16, ~ 4, 11 Statutes at Large 135 (1705). Since the Statute, which permitted the do fenriant to Plead more than One Defense or Plea to a Singlo Count, did not give plaintiffs a similar privilege of making more than One Replication to One Plea, the Proeethiral Device of the Replication Dc Injuria, which was a Comprehensive Traverse, was created to cover the need, and become of groat importance. But under the Modern Pr ocedure Re forms, the great mass of technical learning on the subject has become largely obsolete. Ames, cases on Pleading, 104, note (24 ed., Cambridge 1905). .S.

Properly Commencing and Concluding a Rephication requires considerable skill in Plead ing, hence some suggestions as to the Formal Parts of a Replication are discussed below."},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"Page 548 of 735 A REPLICATION was usually Entitled in the Court and of the Term at which it was Pleaded; and the names of the plaintiff and of the defendant were stated in the margin — thus, “AD. v. C.D.” ‘~ When the Body of the Replication only contained an Answer to a Part of the Plea, the Commencement should then specify the Part intended to be Answered, for if the Com mencement professed to Answer the Whole. but the Body contained an answer to Part only, t he whole Replication was insufficient. Every Replication must Conclude either to the Country or with a Verification and Pray er of Judgment. A Replication to a Plea in Bar has this Commencement: “~ * * Says that by reason of anything in the said Plea all eged he ought not to be barred from having and maintaining his aforesaid action against him, the said C.D., because, he says,” etc. This Formula is commonly called “Precludi Non.” The Conclusion is thus: In Debt, “Wherefore he Prays Judgment, and his debt aforesaid, together with his Damages by him sustained by reason of the detention thereof, to be ad judged to him;” in Covenant, “Wherefore he Prays Judgment, and his Damages by him sustained by reason of the said Breach of Covenant, to be adjudged to him;” in Tres pass, “Wherefore he Prays Judgment, and his Damages by him sustained by reason of the committing of the said Trespasses, to be ad - 13.

With respect to Pleadings Subsequent to the Replication, it will be sufficient to ob serve, in general, that those on the part of the defendant follow the same form of Com mencement and Conclusion as the Plea; th ose on the part of the plaintiff, the same as the Replication. STATUS OF THE INJURIA UNDER PRACTICE ACTS COURT 283. Cases decided under Modern Codes, Practice Acts, and Rules of Court, evince the continued existence and application of the Rep lication De Injuria. UNTIL somewhat more than a century ago, the Replication De Injuria was limited to Trespass and Trespass on the Case; in 1832, as a result of Selby v. Bardons,’ 4 it was ex tended to Replevin. Two years later, the sit uation was complic ated by the promulgation of the Hilary Rules, which sought to restrict the Scope of the General Issues in the Various Forms of Action. As one of the consequences the institution of Special Pleading was given an additional impetus, thus causing great diffic ulty when it came to framing Replica tions in Contract Actions. It is, therefore, not surprising to find that the English courts began, in the year 1836 in the case of Issac REPLICATION DE MODERN CODES, AND RULES OF 14. 3 B, & Ad. 2, 110 Eng.Rep. 1 (1832). Sec. 283 THE REPLICATION 523 v. Farrar,’ 5 to hold that the Replication IDe Injuria was applicable to an Action of Tres pass on the Case for a Breach of Promise. In the United States, where, in theory at least, the Hilary Rules had not been adopted, it was natural that the"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"Page 549 of 735 English decisions, as influenced by those Rules, should not be adopted. Thus, we find Gould stating that the Traverse Dc In~uria, ccc., Abs que Tall Causa, though of frequent occurrence, is con fined to actions Ex Delicto, and used only in Replications. 10 But this view did not prevail, as shown by the Statement of Scudder, J., in the New Jersey case of Ruckman v. The Ridge field Park Railroad Com pany,” in which it was urged that the Replication De Injunia was inapplicable in Actions Ex Contractu. The Judge declared: “Formerly the General Traverse, Dc injuria, was confined in practice to Actions of Trespass, Replevin, and cases for injuries. But wh en, under the New Rules [the Hilary Rules], Special Pleas in Excuse became frequent in Actions of As sumpsit and Debt on Simple Contracts, it became reasonable that the plaintiff should be a]lowed to take Issue by a General Trav erse of the Whole Matter of Excuse alleged, and such Pleading was sustained by the Courts. There was no occasion to use this Replication when the usual Plea in Assumpsit was the General Issue. But, as more Special Defenses by Pleading are being favored in the modern practice of our Courts and by Legislation, the Replication De Injuria be comes applieable as a General Traverse of the Excuse and all the Material Allegations in the Special Plea. It is only allowed where the Plea is in Excuse, and not in Denial of the Cause of Action. It is bad when the 15. 1 M. & W, 65, 150 EngRep. 248 (1836). ‘0.

Diccon, 2 ° was said, by Pollock, C.B., to be “in the nature of a General Replication De Injuria,” 2 ’ and the effect of such a Joinder was to place in Issue all the Material Al legations of the Pleading to which it was interposed. In Maryland, in 1856, or just four years after the English Act, 22 the Repli cation Dc Injuria was abolished by Statute and a Joinder of Issue was subst ituted in lieu thereof. And in the District of Columbia, as early as the year 1879, this Form of Joinder was authorized by a Rule of Court, the effect of which was to put in Issue the Substance of the Plea. 23 In most American Jurisdictions, following the e xample of Mary land, a similar Joinder of Issue has been authoniz~d in most actions and at any Stage of the Pleading, such Form of Pleading being broadly the equivalent of the Replication Dc Injuria, having the effect of a Compendi 18.

Keigwin suggests that the prac tical effect is that in any action a Party may “not only Reply, but Rejoin or Surrejoin Dc Injuria” 21 He wrote that “some Lawyers who shudder at the imaginary intricacies of Pleading would be shocked to learn that they have all their lives been using the archaic and mysterious Replication Dc Injuria in disguise, and to an extent vastly beyond the • Contemplation of the Common - Law, very ‘much as the bourgeois in Moliere’s comedy was startled to discover"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"Page 550 of 735 that he had always spoken prose without knowing that it was prose.” 26 Two Delaware cases testify as to the con ~Unued existence and application of the Repli cation Dc Injuria in its virgin form where the Code is not adopted. In the tirst case, Murden v. Russell, 26 decided in 1915, the plaintiff brought an Action of Trespass by Assault, and for the removal of the plaintiff’ s houseboat from a beach. The defendant Pleaded in Jus tification, that the title to the beach was in a Town, and that as the Agent of the Town, he removed the boat, as he lawfully might do, The plaintiff filed a Replication IDe Injuria to each of the two Pleas as set forth above, whereupon the defendant filed a Special De murrer, on the ground, first, that such a Rep lication is proper only in Reply to a Plea in Excuse; and second, that such a Replication Is improper when the defendant, in his own right, o r as a servant to another, claims an In terest or Title in Land, citing as authority the tamous English Crc gate’s Case, 27 New Jersey Case of Taverna v.

T he plaintiff did not dispute the principles urged in support of the Demurrer, and left the question of their application to the Court, which sustained the Demurrer and gave Judgment for the defendant, Boyce, 3., in accordance with the Rule at Common - Law, d eclaring: “The Replication Dc Injuria is proper when Matters in Excuse are pleaded; but when Justification, or a claim of Title or Interest in Land, is pleaded the Replica tion must be by way of a Special Traverse.” ~° In the second case, Empire Box Corpo ra tion v. Jefferson island Salt Mining Co.,31 de cided in 1941, the plaintiff filed a Declara tion containing Four Counts, Three Special Counts, and One on a Common Count. To the eleventh and twelfth Pleas, the plaintiff filed a Replication Dc Injuria, wh ereupon the de fendant entered a Special Demurrer, on the grounds first, that a Replication De Injuria is not available in Actions Ex Contractu; and second, that a Replication IDe Injuria is not permitted where a Plea sets forth Matters of Discharge. The S pecial Demurrer to the Rep lication IDe Injuria was sustained on the ground that such Form of Replication was not a Proper Form of Traverse in an Action of Assunipsit. While this is not correct as the Replication Dc Injuria finally developed, the position of the Court is made clear by Chief Justice Layton, who declared: “The System of Pleading in force in this State, and strictly adhered to, is that System which prevailed in England at the time of our Independence ex cept as changed or modified by Constitut ional or Statutory Enactment. In Asswnpsit, the General Issue of Non - Assumpsit puts the whole Declaration in issue, and almost every thing may be given in evidence which shows that the plaintiff at the time of Commencing Suit had no Cause of Action.

A Departure is an Abandonment at a Later Stage of Pleading of the Ground on which the Plaintiff has placed his Cause of Action, or the Defendant his Defense. Such a Fault in Pleading is not permitted as the Record would by such means be extended to an in - definite length, and the Formulation of a Spe cific Issue unnecessarily delayed. Departure Defined THE Common - Law Rule was that in Pleading there must be no Departure. A Departure occurs where, in any Pleading, a Party Abandons the Ground taken in his las t Antecedent Pleading, and Resorts to Another, distinct from and not fortifying the first. From this definition it becomes clear that this Fault in Pleading can never arise until the Replication, but it may arise in that or any Subsequent Stage of Pleading . It is, therefore, a Settled Rule that the Repli cation or Rejoinder must not Depart from the Allegations of the Declaration or Plea in any material matter. 32 Its most frequent point of occurrence is in the Rejoinder by the defendant, and the Fault may be either in the Substance of the Defense, or the Law on which it is founded, and this also applies where plaintiff Departs in his Replication from the Ground on which he placed his Action in the Declaration. The Pleader must not Abandon a Previous Ground in his Pleading and assume a New One, For 32. Co.Litt. 304a (Philadelphia 1853); English: Hick man v.

A Replication in Estoppel is No Departure or aban dcoiment of the ease statod in the Declaration. The Reason for the Rule Against Departure THE Rule against Departure was evidently necessary to prevent the retardation in the development of the Issue. For, while the Parties, in Pleadin~ are respectively con fined to the grounds they have first taken in their Declaration or Plea, the Process of Pleading, after a few Alterations of Stat e inent, will exhaust all the Facts involved in the cause, and thereby develop the Issue in dispute. But if at any Stage of the Available Series of Pleadings, a New State of Facts be introduced, the Termination of the Plead ings in a Single, Clear - Cut, Wel l - Defined Issue of Fact, is in consequence postponed. Besides, if One Departure were permitted, the Parties might, on the same principle, shift their ground, either in Point of Fact or in Point of Law, as often as they pleased; and an almost indefinite, if not intolerable length of altercation might, in many cases, be the consequence. THE KINDS OF DEPARTURES AND THE STAGE OF PLEADING AT WHICH THEY MAY OCCUR 285. Departures were of Two hinds, being either in Point of Fact, or in Point of Law. The earliest Stage of Pleading at which a plaintiff may Depart is in the Replication; the earliest Stage of Pleading at which a defend ant may Depart is in the Rejoinder. Departure in the Replication THE Replication is the earliest Stage of Pleading at which the plaintiff may be guilty of the Fault of Departure. And such a De parture may be in Point of Fact or in Point of Law. (I) In Point of F’act. — Thus, for ex ample, where, ha Special Assumpsit, the plaintiffs, as Executors, declared on several Promises alleged to have been made to the testator in his lifetime, the defendant Plead ed that she did not Promise within six years before the obtaining of the Original Writ of the plaintiffs, to which the plaintiffs Replied 35. Lee v. Rogers, 1 Let 110, 83 Eng.Rep. 322 (1663); Cole,. Hawkins, 10 Mod. 348,88 Eng,1te~ti759 (1717). that, within six years before the obtaining of the Original Writ, the Letters Testamentary were granted to them, whereby the action accrued to them, the said plaintiffs, within six years, the Cou rt held that there was a Departure,"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"Page 553 of 735 as in the Declaration they had laid Promises to the Testator, whercas in the Replication they had alleged a Right of Action as accruing to themselves as Ex ecutors. 36 If they meant to put their action on this ground, in the Declaration they ought to have laid Promises to themselves, as Ex ecutors. (II) In Point of Law. — Thus, for example, in Mole v. Wallis, 3 ’ where the plaintiff de clared in Covenant on an Indenture of Ap prenticeship, by which the defendant was to serve h im for seven years, and Assigned, as Breach of Covenant, that the defendant left his service within the seven years, the de fendant Pleaded Infancy, to which the plain tiff Replied that, by the Custom of London, infants may bind themselves as apprentices, the Court held there was a Departure in Point of Law between the Declaration and the Replication, as that which is Pleaded Generally as the Common Law cannot be maintained by a Custom. Departure in the Rejoinder TIlE Rejoinder is the earliest Stage of Ple ading at which the defendant may be guilty of the Fault of Departure, and it occurs more frequently at this point than in the Replication. And such a Departure may be in Point of Fact or in Point of Law, (I) In Point of Fact. — Thus, for example, in Debt on a Bond conditioned to perform an Award, so that the same was delivered to the defendant by a certain time, the de fendant Pleaded that the Arbitrators did not make any Award, to which the plaintiff re plied that the Arbitrators did make an Award to such a n effect, and that the same was ~ Hickman v. Walker, Willes 27, i25 Eng.Bep. 1037 (1737). 527 Tendered by the proper time, to which Repli cation the defendant Rejoined that the Award was not so Tendered, to which Rejoinder the plaintiff Demurred on the ground that the Rejoinder was a Departure from the Plea in Bar. In sustaining the plaintiff’s Demurrer, the Court relied on the fact that in the defendant’s Original Plea in Bar, he had said that the Arbitrators made no Award, whereas, in his Rejoinder, he implicitly con fessed that the Arbitrator had made an Award, but says that it was not Tendered according to the condition of the bond. This, in the view of the Court, was a clear Depar ture, for it is one thing not to make an Award and another thing not to Tender it when made. And although these things were nec essary, by the condition of the bond, to bind the defendant to perform the Award, y et the defendant should have relied only upon one or the other by itself. 39 And so where the plaintiffs declared in Debt on a Bond conditioned to keep the plain tiffs harmless and indemnified from all suits of one Cook, the defendants Pleaded that they ha d kept the plaintiffs harmless, to which the plaintiffs Replied that Cook had sued them, so that the defendants had not kept them harmless, to which the defend ants Rejoined that they had not had any notice of the Damnification. The Court held first, that the Matter of the Rejoinder was bad, as the plaintiffs were not legally bound to give notice; and second, that the Rejoin der was a Departure from the Plea in Bar, as in the Plea in Bar the defendants Pleaded that they had saved harmless the plaintiffs, wh ereas in the Rejoinder they confessed that they had not saved the plaintiffs harmless, and said that they had not had Notice of the Damnification; which was a plain De parture?° SS - itoberts v.

And where, in Debt on a Bond conditioned to perform the covenants in an indenture of lease, one of which was that the lessee, at every felling of wood, would make a fence, the defendant Pleaded that he had not felled any wood, to which the plaintiff Replied that he felled two acres of wood, but make no fence, to which the defendant Rejoined that he did make a fence, the Court held there was a Departure. 4 ° (II) In Point of Law. — The cases dis cussed above were cases in which the de fendant, at the Rejoinder Stage of Pleading, deserted the ground, in Point of Fact, that he had first taken in his Plea. It i s, however, also a Departure, where he puts the Same Facts on a new ground in Point of Law, as where he relies on the effect of the Common Law"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"Page 554 of 735 in his Plea, and on a Statute in his Re joinder. Thus, where, in Trespass, the defendant made Title to the premi ses, Pleading a demise for fifty years made by a certain college, to which the plaintiff Replied that there was another lease of the same premises, which had been assigned to the defendant, and which was unexpired at the time of the mak ing of the said lea se for fifty years, and alleged a proviso in the Act of 31 Hen. VIII, c. 13, 4 Statutes at Large 455 (1539), avoid ing all leases, by the colleges to which that Act related, made under such circumstances as the lease last mentioned, to which the defendant, by way of Rejoinder, Pleaded an other Proviso in the Statute, which allowed such leases to be good for twenty - one years, if made to the same person, and that by virtue thereof, the devise stated in his Plea was available for twenty - one years at least, the Judges held the Rejoinder to be a IDe - 40.

The Method of Taking Advantage the Fault of Departure is by a General Th murrer; it involves, however, an Exception I the General Rule that a violation of a Rule Pleading constitutes a Defect in Form. AT C ommon Law any violation of a Rul of Pleading was said to create a Defect ii Form; any violation of a Rule of Substantivi Law a Defect in Substance. As a Departun involved a violation of the Rule of PIeadin~ that there must be No Departure, it would appear, on analysis, that such a Fault con stituted a Defect in Form and should, there - fore, have been available on Special De murrer. But this was not the Law; the Rule was that the Mode of taking Advantage of a Departure was by General Demurrer, 42 the Fault bei ng an Active Abandonment of the ground on which the plaintiff had placed his Cause of Action or the defendant his Defense, and hence it was treated as a Fault in Substance. 43 A Verdict in favor of him who makes the Departure will cure the Fault, however, i f the Matter Pleaded by way of Departure is a sufficient Answer, in Sub stance, to what is before Pleaded by the adverse party; that is, if it would have been 41, Pulrnerston v, Steward, Flow. 102, 73 Engitep 160 (1554). 42. The availability of the Fault of Departure on a General Demurrer, results from the fact that the Defect of Departure is one of the Five Exceptions to the General Rule that a Violation of a Rule o t Pleading constitutes a Defect in Form. 43~ Massachusetts: Iteay cc Goodwin, 16 Mass. 1 (1819); New Hampshire: Tarleton v.

In general, under Modern Codes and Practice Acts, the Common - Law Doctrine as to Departure still prevails. THE rule as to Departure under Modern Codes and Practice Acts is ge nerally the same as at Common Law, that is, that the plaintiff in his Replication, and the defendant in his Rejoinder, may not Depart from the Cause of Action set forth in the Declaration or the Defense set forth in the Plea. 4~"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"Page 555 of 735 Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, where there is no counterclaim or cross claim in the Answer, a Reply is permitted under Rule 7(a) only upon order of the Court.

NEW ASSIGNMENT — DEFINITION, NECES SITY AND APPLICATION 288. A New Assignment is a restatement in the Replication of the plaintiff’s Cause of Ac tion. Where the Declaration in an Action is ambiguous and the defendant Pleads Facts which literally are an Answer to it, but not to the R eal Claim set up by the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s course is to Reply by Way of New Assignment, that is, to allege that he brought his Action, not for the cause supposed by the 4~.

Market Investment Co., 95 Wash. 484, 164 P. 65 (1917). 529 defendant, but for some Other Cause, to which the Plea had no application, THE necessity for this Form of Procedural Device arose from the very Gener al Mode of Statement sometimes permitted in the Declaration, as in Trespass to land. This made it possible for the defendant to Plead an evasive Plea, which, in turn, rendered it necessary for the plaintiff in his Replication to restate the Cause of Action intended, with greater precision and particularity. 46 Thus, for example, in an action of Tres pass for Assault and Battery, a case may occu r in which the plaintiff has been twice assaulted by the defendant; and one of these assaults may have been Justifiable, being committed in Self - Defense, while the other may have been committed without Legal Excuse. Supposing the plaintiff to bring his act ion for the latter, it will be found, by referring to the Form of Declaration for Assault and Battery, that the statement is so General as not to indicate to which of the two assaults the plaintiff means to refer. 41 The defendant may therefore suppose, or af fect to suppose, that the first is the assault intended, and will Plead Son Assault Dc mesne. This Plea the plaintiff cannot safely Traverse, because, as an Assault was in fact committed by the defendant, under the circumstances of Excuse here alleged, the defendant would have a Right, under the Issue Joined upon such Traverse, to prove those circumstances, and to presume that such Assault, and no other, is the Cause of Action. And it is evidently reasonable that he should have this Right; for if the pla intiff were, at the Trial of the Issue, to be allowed to set up a different Assault, the defendant might suffer, by a mistake 46.

The plaintiff, therefo re, in the case supposed, not being able to safely Traverse, and having no ground either for Demurrer or for Plead ing in Confession and Avoidance, has no course, but by a New Pleading to correct the mistake occasioned by the Generality of the Declaration, and to declare that he brought his action, not for the first, but for the second, assault; and this is called “New Assignment”. The mistake being thus set right by the New Assignment, it remains for the defendant to plead such Matter as he may have in Ans wer to the Assault last mentioned, the first being now out of the question. 45 There"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"Page 556 of 735 are other situations where similar considerations make necessary a New Assignment of the plaintiff’s Real Cause of Action, which was left uncertain by reason of having been Generally Alleged in the Declaration. FORM OF NEW ASSIGNMENT 289. A New Assignment appears in the Rep lication; it is not, however, a true Replication, as it does not attempt, by either Pleading by Way of Traverse or in Confession and Avoid ance, t o meet the Defendant’s Plea. THE Form of the Replication which ap pears below is a New Assignment in a case where the defendant, in Trespass for Assault and Battery, has Pleaded in Confession and Avoidance of Trespasses other than those intended to be dec lared upon by the plaintiff: FORM OF NEW ASSIGNMENT AND as to the said Plea of the said CD. by him secondly above pleaded, as to the said several trespasses in the introductory part of that Plea mentioned and therein attempted to be justified, the said L B. says that, by reason of anything in that Plea alleged, he ought not to be barred from having and maintaining his aforesaid action thereof against the said C.D., because he says that he brought his said action, not for the Tres passes in the said second Plea acknowledged to have been done, but for that the said CD. heretofore, to wit, on the day of _______ AD. 19_, with force and arms, at aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, upon another and different occasion, and for another and different purpose, than i n the said second Plea mentioned, made another and different assault upon the said AR than the assault in the said second Plea mentioned, and then and there beat, wounded, and ill - treated him, in manner and form as the said A,B, bath above thereof complain ed; which said trespasses, above Newly Assigned, are other and different trespasses than the said trespasses in the said second Plea acknowl edged to have been done. And this the said A.B. is ready to verify. Wherefore, inas much as the said C.D, hath not answered the said trespasses above Newly Assigned, he, the said A.R, Prays Judgment and his Damages by him sustained by reason of the committing thereof to be adjudged to him, etc. NEW ASSIGNMENT AS IN THE NATURE OF A NEW DECLARATION 290. It has been said that a New Assign nient is in the Nature of a New Declaration, meaning that it is not a true Replication, as it does not profess to Reply to anything in the defendant’s Plea; rather it seeks to state afresh, and with greater detail, the ci rcum stances of the plaintiff’s case originally Gen erally Laid in the Declaration. A NEW ASSIGNMENT is said to be in the Nature of a New Declaration, although in reality it was a Form of Common - Law Amendment, which contrary to the Ordinary Amendment coul d be exercised as a Matter of Right rather than in the Discretion of the Court. It may, however, more properly be considered as a repetition of the Declara tion, differing only in this: that it distill guishes the true ground of complaint as being 4~. Id. at 222, 223. Sec. 291 THE REPLICATION 531 different from that which is covered by the Plea. Being in the Nature of a New and Repeated Declaration, it is consequently to be framed with as much certainty or specifi cation of circumstances as the Declaration itself. In some cases, indeed, it should be even more particular, so as to avoid the necessity of another New Assignment. Thus, if the plaintiff declares in Trespass Quare Clausum Fregit without naming the close, and the defendant pleads th e Common Bar — a Plea of Libe rum Tenementum — , which obliges the plaintiff to New - Assign, he must, in his New Assignment, either give his close its name, or otherwise sufficiently describe it, even though such name or description was not required in the Dec laration .~ STATUS OF NEW ASSIGNMENT UNDER MODERN CODES. PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES OF COURT 291. The need for New Assignment under the Codes is minimized by virtue of the more complete statement of the claim in the Com plaint and the liberal rules with res pect to ~amendment, but its use has been permitted under some"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"Page 557 of 735 Codes. SINCE the facts are fully set forth in plaintiff’s Complaint under the Codes, there 49. .Soe 1 Cliittv, On Pleading. e~ VIII, Of Replica dons, 628 (14th Am. ed. by Perkins, Springfield, is considerably less need for New Assignment than there was at Common Law. However, in some Code States, the plaintiff is permitted to interpose a reply in the nature of New Assignment, where this becomes nec essary in order to show that the plaintiff’s action is grounded on matter other than that to which the Answer speaks. 5 ° But the need for the use of such procedure is minimized by the fact that the same result can be ac complished by amendment of the Com plaint. 5 ’ Clark points out that the simplified plead ing of the Federal Rules gives little or no occasion for the use of New Assigiinient, and concludes that it does not appear to be a matter of great importance in modern pro cedure, perhaps hardly justifying attempts which have been made to limit, if not pro hibit, anything savoring of New Assign ment. 52 5°.

CHAPTER 24 TilE PRODUCTION, TENDER, AND JOINDER OF ISSUE Sec. 292. Production of Issue. 293. Tender of Issue. 294. Joinder of Issue. PRODUCTION OF ISSUE 292. An Issue in Pleading is a Specific proposition or point of controversy, Affirmed on the O - ~.te Side and Denied on the Other. The reduction of the controversy to Issues is the great Object of Pleading. WE have al ready seen that the defendant, in opposing the Allegations of the Declara tion, must either Demur or Plead, and that, in the course of the Pleadings, they must finally reach a point where there is some question or point presented, Affirmed on One Side and Denied on the Other. The reduc tion of the controversy to some specific ques - tion is the Object of all Pleading, and when reached, it is called the “Issue”; and the Cause, when at Issue, is ready for Trial or for the decision of the Issue raised. A De murr er, either by the defendant to the Decla ration or Other Pleading of the plaintiff, or by the plaintiff to a Plea or Other Pleading of the defendant, being a Denial of the legal sufficiency of the Opposing Pleading, raises at once a Question of Law which i t is always the peculiar Province of the Court to deter mine, without the aid of a Jury. This ques tion must be decided before further proceed ings are had, and it is therefore said that the Demurrer always Tenders an Issue in Law. Again, if the Declaratio n or Other Pleading is sufficient on its face, and no Demurrer is interposed, the Pleadings, whether of the de fendant or the plaintiff, stating Matters of Fact, must at length reach a point where the Opposing Party will simply Traverse or Deny what is all eged, and this Traverse must al ways Tender an Issue, which is One of Fact, and which the formal words of the Traverse refer to a Trial by Jury, by concluding “to the Country.” The decision on an Issue of Law may not necessarily end the Pleadings, except for the time being, since if the Demurrer be over ruled, the Party offering it is now generally allowed to Plead Over, as it is termed — that is, to offer the Pleading he would have made if he had considered the Pleading Demurred to sufficient; but the Tender and"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"Page 558 of 735 Acceptance of an Issue of Fact closes all Pleading in the Action, as there is then nothing left but a Trial, which must dispose of the Action on its Merits. TENDER OF ISSUE 293. Upon a tra verse, Issue must be Ten dered - AU Pleadings which Form the Issue by an Affirmative and Negative must Conclude to the Conntry But where New Matter is introduced, the Pleading should always Con clude with a Verification. WE have before seen that it is the Object of All Pleadings to bring the Parties, in the course of their mutual altercations, to an Issue that is a single entire point, Affirmed on the One Side and Denied on the Other; and it is to effect this Object that the above Rule was established. Ther e can be no ar rival at this point until one or the other 532 See. 293 PRODUCTION, TENDER, AND JOINDER OF ISSUE 533 of the Parties, by the Conclusion of his Pleading, offers an Issue for the acceptance of his opponent, and this offer is called the “Tender of Issue.” The Formulae of Tender ing the Issue vary according to the Mode of Trial proposed. Upon a disputed Question of Fact the Issue is Tendered by a Conclusion to the Country — referring the question to a Trial by a Jury — usually in the following form: “ And this the said A.B. Prays may be inquired of by the Country” — if by the plaintiff; or, “And of this the said CD. puts himself upon the Country” — if by the de fendant. 1 Wherever, therefore, a Denial or Contradiction of Fact occurs in Pleading, Is sue ought at the same time to be Tendered on the Fact Denied, by Concluding the Plead ing in One of the above Forms, The Form of Tendering Issue to be tried by Matter of Record is as follows: The Party setting up the Matter of Record (in the Plea, for in stance) sa ys: “And this the said CD. is ready to Verify by the said Record.” The other Party, after denying the existence of the Record (in the Replication, for instance), says: “And this he, the said A.B., is ready to Verify when, where, and in such manner as the C ourt here shall order, direct, or ap point.” The reason is that, as it sufficiently ap pears what is the Issue or Matter in dispute, it is time the Pleadings should close and the method of deciding the Issue be adjusted; and the Conclusion in the above Fo rm al ways refers the decision to a Trial by Jury. The Pleadings which should thus conclude “to the Country” embrace all Forms of the 1. Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleaffing in Civil Actions, ~. I, Of the Proceedings in an Ac tion, from its Commencement to Its Termination, 48, 60 (Williston ed., Cambridge, Mass., 18~5). It is held, however, that there is no material differ once between these two Modes of Expression and that if “ponit se’ be substituted for “petit quod inquiratur,” or vice ve rsa, the mistake Is unimpor tant. Weltale v. Glover, 10 Mod. 166, 88 Eng.Rep. 677 (1713). Traverse except the Special Form, and also Replications, Rejoinders, etc., which do not contain New Matter, but present an Affir mative or Denial in a direct and posi tive form. Conciw~ion by Verification When the Answering Pleading contains New Matter, introducing Statements of Fact not previously mentioned by the other side, the latter has the right to be heard in an swer if the accompanying Denial is immate rial, an d a Tender of Issue by the Party Pleading such matter would therefore be pre mature. 2 In such case, unless the New Mat ter is a Negative, the Pleading concludes with a “Verification,” as it is termed, gener ally in the following words: “And this the said A .B. is ready to Verify.” To this exception belongs the case former ly noticed, of Special Traverses. These, as already explained, never Tender Issue, but always Conclude with a Verification; and the reason seems to be, that in such of them as contain New Matter in the Inducement, the introduction of that New Matter will give the Opposite Party a right to be heard in answer to it if the absque hoc be imma terial, and consequently makes a Tender of Issue premature. And, on the other hand, with respect to suc h Special Traverses as contain no New Matter in the Inducement, they seem in this respect to follow the anal ogy of those first mentioned, though they are not within the same reason. Not only in the case of Special Traverses, but in other instances also, to which that Form does not apply, a Traverse may some times involve the Allegation of New Matter;"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"Page 559 of 735 2.

C., 1000). 534 DEFENSIVE PLEADINGS Ch. 24 and in all such instances, as well as upon a Special Traverse, and for a similar reason, the Conclusion must be with a Verification, and not to the Country. An illustration of this is afforded by a case of very ordinary occurrence, viz., where the Action is in Debt on a Bond Conditioned for Performance of Covenants. If the defendant Pleads Gener ally Performance of the Covenants, and the plaintiff, in his Replication, relies on a Breach of them, he must show Specially in what that Breach consists; for to Reply Gen er ally that the defendant did not Perform them would be too vague and uncertain. His Replication, therefore, setting forth, as it necessarily does, the circumstances of the Breach, discloses New Matter; and conse quently, though it is a Direct Denial or Trav erse of the Plea, it must not Tender Issue, but must Conclude with a Verification. 4 So, in another common case, in an Action of Debt on Bond conditioned to indemnify the plaintiff against the consequences of a cer tain act, if the defendant Pleads Non Dam - nificatus, and the plaintiff Replies, Alleging a Damnification, he must, on the principle just explained, set forth the circumstances, and the New Matter thus introduced will make a Verification necessary 5 To these it may be useful to add another example. The plaintiff declared in Debt on a Bond Condi tioned for the Performance of certain Cove - nants by the defendant, in his capacity of Clerk to the plaintiff; one of which Cove nants was to account for all the money that he should receive. The defendant ple aded performance. The plaintiff Replied, that on such a day such a sum came to his hands, which he had not accounted for. The defend ant Rejoined, that he did account, and in the following manner: that thieves broke into 4. Gainsford v. Griffith, 1 ~Vnis. SaunJ. 51, 85 Eng. Rep. 59 (1667). 5. Richards v. Hodges, 2 \\ Vms.Sauni]. 80, 85 Eng. Rep. 749 (1670). the counting - house and stole the money, and that he acquainted the plaintiff of the fact; and he Concluded with a Verification. The Court held that, though there was an express affirmative that he did account, in contradic tion to the Statement in the Replication that he did not account, yet the Conclusion ~vith a Verification was right; for Ne w Matter be ing alleged in the Rejoinder, the plaintiff ought to have liberty to come in with a Sur rejoinder, and Answer it by Traversing the robbery. 6 The application, however, to particular cases, of this exception, as to the introduc tion of New Matte r, is occasionally nice and doubtful; and it becomes difficult sometimes to say whether there is any such introduc tion of New Matter as to make the Tender of Issue improper. Thus, in Debt on a Bond conditioned to render a full account to the plaintiff of all such sums of money and goods as were belonging to W. N. at the time of his death, the defendant Pleaded that no goods or sums of money came to his hands. The plaintiff Replied, that a silver bowl, which belonged to said W. N. at the time of his death, came to the hands of the defendant, viz, on such a day and year; “and this he is ready to Verify,” etc. On Demurrer, it was contended that the Replication ought to have Concluded to the Country, there being a complete Negative and Affirmative; but the Cour t thought it well concluded, as New Matter was introduced. However, the learn ed Judge who reports the case thinks it clear that the Replication was bad; and Mr. Ser geant Williams expresses the same opinion, holding that there was no introduction of New M atter such as to render a Verification proper. 7 6.

The Rule applies both to Issues — (I) In Fact; and (II) In Law IF issue be well Tendered both in Point of Substance and in Point of Form, nothing re mains for the Opposite Party but to accept or Join in It; and he can neither Demur, Traverse, nor Plead in Confession and Avoid ance. 8 The Form of accepting or Joining in the Tender of an Issue in Fact is by the use of the words “And the said A.B. doth the like.” This is called the “Similiter.” It is only re quired when the Conclusion of the Adverse Pleading Tenders a Trial by Jury, but is then essential. If omitted by the Party, it may be added for him to complete the Record, as, when the Issue is well Tendered, he has no option but to accept it.° An Issue need neve r be accepted unless it is well Tendered.

As now used, the Similiter serves to mark both the acceptance of the question itself and the Manner of Trial proposed.

In this connection, however, it should be kept in mind that sometimes the Court decides certain Issues of Fact, as when the Action is founded upon a Record and the defendant has pleaded Nut Tiel Record, as in an Action on a Domestic Judgment, or where a Jury Trial is waived. Where, the refore, upon a Demurrer, the Issue in Law has been Entered on Record, the next step at Common Law is to Move for a Conciliuhi, that is, to move to have a day appointed on which the Court will hear the Counsel of the Parties argue the Demurrer. In this coun try this development is described as placing the Demurrer on the argument list or “Law and Motion Calendar,” according to the practice which prevails. And on the day entered for argument, or as soon thereafter as the business of the Court will permit, the Demurrer is argued viva voce in Court by the respective counsel of both parties, after which the Judge or Judges announce their decision, Trial Without a Jury — Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law - IN some instances, at Common Law, a case might be tried by a Court without a Jury. This might occur where there was no right to a Jury Trial or where the par ties had waived the right.

At Common Law Trials by Jury were either at Bar or Nisi Prius, The latter type of Trial was a product of the Statute of West minster II (1285), which permitted actions, except those of great importance, to be tried out on the Nisi Prius Circuits, thus eliminat ing the inconvenience to the Parties, Jurors and Witnesses of Attending the Trial at West 2.

Sec. 296 TRIAL BY COURT OR BY JURY 539 minster, when they lived in a distant County and the means of transportation were inade quate. Trial at Bar or at Nisi Prius TRIALS by the Jury are either at Bar, or Nisi Prius. Prior to the Statute of West minster II (1285)~ civil causes were tried at the Bar, before all the Judges of the Court, in Term - Time; or, when of no great mo ment, before the Justices in Eyre. All causes anciently commenced in the Superior Com mon - Law Courts were tried at the Bar of the Specific Court in which they were com menced, wherever the Court might be sitting. The Jury was, therefore, necessarily brought before the Court from the County in which the Venue was laid by a Writ of Venire Facias Juratores. Only actions of great importance were brought in the Superior Courts, suits of less significance being disposed of in the Court Baron, the Hundred and County Courts. In time, however, by re ason of the superior quality of justice administered in the Superior Courts, cases of a trifling amount and nature were brought to these Courts for Trial, and it imposed an intolera ble burden upon the Parties, Jurors and Witnesses to compel them to attend the Trial at Westminster when they lived in a distant County and the means of transportation were scarce and difficult. Accordingly, at a very early date, the practice developed of contin uing the cause from Term to Term in the Court above, provided the J ustices in Eyre did not come into the County where the cause of action arose; and if it appeared that they arrived there during the continuance, the whole cause was removed from the Jurisdic tion of the Superior Court to that of the Jus tices in Eyre.° 5. 13 Edw. 1, c. 30, 1 Statutes at Large 203 (1285). 8. 2 Tidd, The Practice of the Court of King’s Bench in Persona] Actions, c. XXX~1i, Of Trials by the Country, and their Incidents, 706 (Philadelphia, 1807). But when the Court of Common Pleas be came fix ed at Westminster Hall by virtue of Magna Charta in 1215,’ the practice of con ducting Trials before the Bar of one of the Su perior Courts, in cases which could not be properly removed therefrom, was fraught with great hardship to the Parties, Witnesses, and Jurors, whose attendance was required. Once it was recognized that the Fact - Finding Process could be separated from the Law and from the rest of the legal procedure involved, the way was opened to relieve the hardship to the Parties, Jurors and Witness es occa - sioned by the necessity of traveling to West minster in London."},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"Page 564 of 735 This relief came in 1285 in the Form of the Statute of Westminster II, 13 Edw. I, c. 30, 1 Statutes at Large 203. Under this Statute power was conferred upon the Jus tices of Assize, who had superseded the Jus tices in Eyre, to try Common Issues in Tres pass, and other less important actions, with instructions to return them, when tried, into the Superior Courts above, where alone Judg ment could be Rendered and Enrolled. 8 Since, unde r the Statute, only the Trial, and not the determination in the entire case, was now to be conducted in the Lower Court, the Nisi Prius Clause was omitted from the Conditional Continuances. Instead, the Stat ute directed that there should be inserted in th e Writs of Venire Facias the foflowing lan guage, “that the Sheriff should cause the Ju rors to come to Westminster (or wherever the King’s Courts should be held) on such a day in Easter and Michaelmas terms (Nisi Prius), unless before that day the Justice s as signed to take Assizes shall come into his said County.” As the Justices in Assize were al 7.

This Statute was commonly known and designated as the Stat ute of Nisi Prius (1285), and, in consequence, the same name was given to the Trial con ducted in pursuance of its authority before the Justices of Assize.° The pr actice under the Statute of Nisi Pri us (1285) developed an inconvenience. It arose out of the fact that the Sheriff made no Return of the Jury to the Superior Court. Thus, the parties to the action remained in ignorance as to the Names of the Jurors un ti l they were actually called at the Trial. The Counsel of the Parties, therefore, found themselves unprepared to make Challenges or take Exceptions. This difficulty was cor rected by the Statute of 42 Edw. III, c. 11, 2 Statutes at Large 183, enacted in 136 8. Under this Statute, the Method of Trial at Nisi Prius was changed. It was provided that no Inquest, except of Assize and Gaol Delivery, should be taken by Writ of Nisi Prius until after the Sheriff had made a Re turn of the Names of the Jurors to the Su perior Court. Selection of the Jury — Summoning, Impanel Ling and Examining (I) Summoning the Jury. — When the par ties have put themselves upon the Country, which is the technical way of referring the issue between them to the Jury, one of the Entries upon the Roll is the Award of the Mode of Decision, which, in the case of Trial by Jury, directs the issuance of a Writ of Venire Patios commanding the Sheriff of the County where the facts stated in the pleading S. See Martin, Civil Procedure at common Law, e. XIV, Trial, Verdict, Judgment and Execution, Arti cle I, Trial, § 362, Trials by Jury Ordinary, 307 (St. Paul, 1905). are alleged to have occurred, to Summon a Jury to try the issue. (II) impanelling the Jury. — When the Jur ors appear in Court, the first step and one of the most important in Trial by Jury, is the process of Drawing and Selecting the Jur ors from what is known as the “Panel.” It is a list of the prospective Jurors sum moned by the Sheriff to serv e on the Juries which may be needed during a Particular Term, or for the Trial of a Particular Action. The Names of these Jurors are written on ballots 10 or tickets and placed in a box, and from the larger number of prospective Jurors in the Panel, names are drawn by lot and called to be sworn as Jurors upon the Jury, unless challenged or excused. If the Orig inal Panel be exhausted by Challenges or Ex cuses, a further supply, known as “Tales - men,” ‘~ may be summoned. (III) Challenges to the Jury. — Tidd sa ys that Challenges are of two kinds, first, to the Array; and second, to the Polls? 2 Challenges to the Array took the form of an Exception to the Whole Panel, in which the Jury are Arrayed, or set"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"Page 565 of 735 in order by the Sheriff on his Return. Such objections to the Jury may be based upon some charge of par tiality, or upon some default in the Sheriff, or his Deputy who Arrayed the Panel. Also, if there be no personal objection against the Sheriff, yet if he Arrays the Panel at the nomination, or under the directi on of either 10. By the Balloting Act, 3 Ceo. II, c. 25, § 11, 16 Statutes at Large 167 (1730), the process of select ing Jurors by baflot was carefully restricted. 11. “The qualification of a Tales man, In point of es tate, is only five pounds per annum. And, by the 7 & 8 Wm. III, e. 32, § 3 [9 Stafutes at Large 492 (1690)), the Sheriff is directed to return such per sons, to serve upon the Tales, as shall be returned upon some other Panel, and then attending the Court. ” 2 Tidd, The Practice of the Court of ICing’s Bench in Personal Actions, c. XXXVII, Of Trials by the Country, and their Incidents, 784 (Philadelphia, 1807). 12. Id. at 779. Sec. 296 TRIAL BY COURT OR BY JURY 541 party, it is good cause of Challenge to the Array. Challenges to the Polls, in capita, are ex ceptions to Particular Jurors. Accordthg to Sir Edward Coke, Challenges of this descrip tion are of four kinds: First, Propter Honoris Respectum, as if a Lord o f Parliament be empanelled on a Jury, in which case he was permitted to chal lenge himself, or be. challenged by either party. Second, Pro pter Defectum, as if a Jury - man be an alien born, or a slave or bondsman, or if he is not a resident of the County, or lacks the necessary qualification of estate. Third, Propter Affecturn, as where a Juror is of kin to either party, within the ninth de gree; that he has been arbitrator, or declared his opinion on either side; that he has an in terest in the cause; tha t there is an action pending between him and the party; that he has accepted money for his Verdict, or even food and drink at either party’s expense; that he has formerly been a Juror in the same cause; or that he is the party’s master, servant, tenant, co unsellor, steward, attorney, or of the same society or corporation with him. Besides these, there are Challenges to the Favour, where the party objects only on account of some probable rounds of suspi cion, as aequathtance, and the like. Fourth, Propter D elictum, as where a Juror was challenged for a conviction of Trea son, Felony, Perjury, or Conspiracy; or if, for some Infamous Offence, he has received Judgment of the Pillory, Tumbrel, or the like, or to be branded, whipped or stigma tized; or if he be o utlawed or excommuni cated, or has been attainted of False Verdict, Praemunire, or Forgery. (IV) The Examination of the Jurors. — Great latitude is permitted in the examina tion of Jurors on the Voir Dire, with regard to the various causes of Challenga, in order that there may be a full and thorough test of their qualifications. The extent of the Exam ination should fit the importance of the case, being searching and thorough in a momen tous case, but brief in a minor one, and per haps addressed to the whole twelve, rather than to the individuals separately. It is ad vantageous, if possible, to show confidence in the Jury. The Juror knows best his own condition of mind and may be examined fully, though not to his infamy or disgrace . Examples of the kinds of questions which may be put are as to his membership in secret organizations, un - der oath and obligation to assist fellow mem bers; whether he has formed a partial opin ion from rumors he has heard, or from the newspapers (facts n ot in themselves disquali fying, though, if taken with others, they might show bias, so further Examination is necessary to make a prima fade case for ex clusion); whether he has any personal knowledge of the facts of the case, or has formed any opinion ab out it, which he would favor if the testimony were equally balanced; whether he has an opinion which it would require evidence to remove; whether his at tention has been called directly or indirectly to any litigation of the same kind in such a way as to i nfluence his Judgment (as if he were a plaintiff himself against an Insurance company); whether he has any prejudice against corporations, as grasping and op pressive; whether he would take the Law from the Court, and be guided and controlled by its"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"Page 566 of 735 Instru ctions, or whether he disagrees with some rule involved; whether he has conscientious scruples against the infliction of death penalty; in short, he may be Exam med generally in regard to his occupation, nationality, religion, social bonds, his sympa thy a nd intellect, and evidence may be intro duced by other witnesses as to his relations or expressions of opinion on the merits of the case. The grounds of objection should be specifically stated, in order to assign Errors 542 LITIGATING THE CONTROVERSY Ch. 2 5 in Law in ruling on the Challenges upon Mo tion for a New Trial.’ 3 The Burden of Proof It may be said that in general the Burden of Proof will rest on the plaintiff for some specific propositions, but on the defendant for others,’ 4 depending upon which side has the Affirmative or Negative of the points at issue. This turns on what facts in dispute are essential to the case, or prima fade Cause of Action, and what to the Defence, respec tively; he who asserts must prove. The plaintiff must make out a prim a facie Cause of Action, while the defendant must satisfy the Court of the truth and adequacy of any Defences of New Matter pleaded in Confes sion and Avoidance. As to these, the plaintiff need only repel the attack and keep them balanced or doubtful, that is, below the re quired degree of persuasion. (I) Prima Facie Case. — The first task of the plaintiff at the Trial is to make out a prima facie case by presenting proof of the facts or points essential to his recovery, if these be denied, in order to move the tribunal to decide in his favor. What facts and propo sitions are sufficient prima fade for a deci sion in the plaintiff’s favor are, in general, de termined by the Rules of Substantive Law ap plicable to the particular case, as to what facts must be p roved to make out a good cause of action; and, these in turn may be af fected by the Rules of Pleading as to the Man ner and Form required in the Statement of the Cause of Action, which marshal and apportion the respective grounds of Claim and Defence. But the Apportionment is not accomplished by the Pleading alone, but is further determined by the Specific Rules as to the Burden of Proof in various cases. Thus, there is no general test as to what con - 13. Shipman, Hanc]book of Common Law Pleading, c. 1, Outline of I’roecedlngs In an Action, 35 (3rd ed. by Ballantine, St. Paul, 1023). 14. lii. at 3t stitutes a prima fade showing, as this de pends upon a combination of factors, such as the Substantive Law, the Rules of Plead ing, and the Rules of Eviden ce, which in turn are affected by a sense of Fair Play and Pub lic Policy. Under the irregularity of pleading which characterized the various Common - Law Forms of Action, and under the limited Series of Pleadings under the Codes, which ordi narily do not e xtend beyond the Replication Stage of Pleading, the Pleadings do not fully indicate by whom proof must be made or clearly Apportion to Each Party the proposi tions which are essential to his case, and which fall to him as the case progresses. Under an ide al System of Pleading, the turns and logical Stages of the Proof Process would be indicated by the Series of Pleadings, viz., the Declaration, Plea, Replication, Re joinder, Surrejoinder, Rebutter and Surrebut ter. But, as we have seen in the Chapter on Pl eas, Peremptory or in Bar, the General Issue, at Common Law, did not always mean that the defendant’s Defences were Negative; in many instances Affirmative Defences were hidden thereunder; in consequence, the Pleadings sometimes failed to disclose who had the Burden of Proof. (II) The Burden of RebuttaL — When the plaintiff makes out his prima fade case by reasonable and credible evidence, the Burden of Proof is said to shift to the defendant, but this use of the phrase is very inaccurate and confusing. The plaintiff must at all times keep the proof of his contentions at the re quired height. This Ultimate Burden of mak ing out a p rima facie case and keeping it good cannot shift; ‘~ but the Burden of going for 15. Professor James Bradley Thayer was the first to demonstrate clearly the inaccuracy of the expres sion that the Burden of Proof “shifts,” and to elab orate on the distinc tion between the Burden of Proof, in the sense of the “duty to establish,” which never shifts, and what Is awkwardly termed “the duty of going forward with the evidence,” which does have the characteristic referred to as ‘shift"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"Page 567 of 735 Sec. 296 ward with the evi dence may shift from time to time. Perhaps an illustration would help to make the matter clear. Suppose A brings Trespass for Assault and Battery against B, who pleads Self Defense, whereupon A Traverses the Plea, thus creat ing an Issue of Fact as to whe ther the defend ant B did strike in Self Defense. At the Trial, as B’s Plea admits the striking, A has, at the outset, a prima facie case; but suppose B goes forward with the evidence by offering suffi cient Proof of Self Defense, then the Burden of Rebutt al, or the need to go forward with the evidence and repel the Proof of B, shifts to A, who as tile asserter of the cause of ac tion, or the proponent, must establish a Pre ponderance of Proof in favor of his cause of action, If he succeeds in this, the Bur den of going fonvard with the evidence will again shift to B. Thus, in the course of the Trial, the Burden of going forward with the evi dence may shift from the plaintiff to the de fendant, and vice versa. When, however, the case finally goes to the Jury, the Burden is always on the Affirmative to keep a Prepon derance of Proof in his favor, while the Neg ative is safe with an even balance or equili brium. (Ill) Respective Functions of Judge and Jury. — Each Party must first pass the gaunt let of the Judge with his evidence in order to get to the Jury on the Issue. Unless the plaintiff makes a prima fade case and satis fies the Judge that he has sufficient evidence to be considered by the Jury, and to form a reasonable basis for the Verdict, a Motion for a N onsuit should be granted by the Judge. This Motion may be made by defendant at the close of plaintiff’s case, when it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish an alleged fact, and there is insufficient evidence on the point, or the only testimony contr adicts it. big.” See flayer, The Bulden or Proof, 4 Harv.L. Dci’. 45 (1590); 9 Wigniore, Evideilce, §2487 (3d ed., Boston 1940); Mekdams v. Bailey, 169 lnd. 518, 82 Nt. 1057 (190?). 543 A Motion to Direct a Verdict for insufficiency of the opponent’ s evidence to go to the Jury may be made by either Party at the close of defendant’s case. The case should be taken from the Jury: (1) Where there is no evi dence to support the Burden of Proof on some essential fact; (2) where there is no conflict in evid ence, as where by the testimony of the plaintiff he put his head out of the window in the train, which is contributory negligence, and precludes recovery as a Matter of Law; (3) where the evidence is somewhat conflict ing, but so certain and convincing tha t no reasonable man could decide otherwise. Di recting a Verdict saves the need of a Motion for a New Trial; but the result of Setting Aside a Verdict is different, in that it results in a New Trial, while Directing a Verdict re sults in Final Judgment. Th e test for the Two Motions is not necessarily identical, though very similar. 1 ° The Judge thus has supervisory control over the Proof and the Jury may be prevented from rendering a Verdict against reason which would later have to be set aside as against th e evidence. 17 By a Demurrer to the Evidence, interposed at the close of the plaintiff’s evidence, the Court may be asked to pronounce the Law upon the case, admitting all facts which the evidence tends to establish and all reasonable inferences therefrom. Where the evidence fails to prove a prima facie case, the Demur rer will be sustained. In theory the Func tions of Court and Jury are sharply divided. It is for the Court to decide Questions o f Law and for the Jury to pass on Questions of Fact. In practice the Court has important functions in passing on the evidence and controlling the work of the Jury, and the Jury applies the Law to the facts under the Instructions of the Court. (lv) The Ord er of Proof. — When the plaintiff has the Burden of Proof on any one 10. 9 Wigmore, Evidence, ~ 2494, (3d ed., Boston 1940). 17. Id. at § 2487. TRIAL BY COURT OR BY JURY Kofiler & Reppy ComLaw P1d9 HG — la 544 LITIGATING THE CONTROVERSY Ch. 25"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"Page 568 of 735 of the Issues, he has the right to open the evidence and prove the facts on which he re lies to establish his case. The defendant may then present evidence to contradict the plain tiff, and also to support his own propositions in defense, to relieve himsel f from the conse quences of the plaintiff’s prima facie case, and by way of Cross - Action. Finally, the plaintiff may disprove in Rebuttal the af firmative portion of his opponent’s evidence. Affirmative Evidence cannot, in strictness, be given by the plain tiff in Rebuttal. He should not reserve his real or main attack until after he has drawn out the testimony of the other party, and until the defendant has closed his case. He should offer all his evidence in chief on the points upon which proof is essentia l to his recovery. In Rebuttal he is confined to Rebutting evidence only, unless the Court, for good reason, permits him to offer evidence on his original case, If the plaintiff be allowed to give Affirmative Evidence in Rebuttal, the defendant should be a llowed to contradict it, by Surrebuttal; so where the credibility of defendant’s witnesses is assailed. Each side must in turn exhaust his case, and neither may give evidence by piecemeal, but must in the first instance produce all his evidence in chief, o n which he relies to establish his case, and is confined in Rebuttal to the contradic tion of affirmative facts brought out by his adversary’s evidence. But it is no objection to Rebuttal that it incidentally tends to cor roborate the party’s case in chief . The plaintiff should not anticipate defenses, or attempt to disprove facts which have not yet been asserted, and upon which there may finally be no controversy. In an action for the price of goods sold, the plaintiff should prove sale, delivery, and acc eptance of the goods, and then rest. He need not prove freedom from defects. If the defendant pro - - pounds this, the plaintiff may rebut or refute .it. The departure from the regular order of iproof may be allowed in the sound exercise of discretion by th e Court. While ordinarily the affirmative must exhaust his evidence before the other party begins, yet the Court may be requested to reopen the case at vari ous stages of the Trial, and admit evidence which has been overlooked or newly discov ered, even af ter one or both have “Rested”; i. e., formally announced that his evidence is closed, and even after motion for nonsuit or submission of the case to the Court. Par ticularly in the course of the trial the order of proof is discretionary, and the plaintiff may be permitted to strengthen his original case by the introduction of cumulative evidence in rebuttal, after the defendant has rested, if opportunity is given to the defendant to reply. But he must ask the Court to reopen the case for the purpose, or it may be excluded as part of the original case which should not have been withheld. The Right to Open or Close (I) The Objective Sought in the Exercise of the Right. — Generally speaking, at Com mon Law, the advantage of the Opening and Closing Speech to the Jury, as well as the Right to Open and Close the Evidence, be longs to the plaintiff, if he has anything to prove essential to his prima facie right of ac tion; but it belongs to the defendant if there be no issue on the Allegations of the Declara tion.’ 8 In Criminal Cases, the prosecution always has the Opening and Closing Argument, and it may be given to the plaintiff in all Civil Ac tions by a Mere Rule of Practice, irrespective of his true position with respect to the Bur den of Proof. This right to ha ve the last word, after the opponent has been heard, with 18. If the defendant admits all the material facts alleged In the Declaration, he may assume the en tire affirmative and have the Right of Opening and Closing the Case, as where he admits the due exe cution of a contract, but sets up the Affirmative IJe tense of Discharge by Release; or by Operation of Law.

TRIAL BY COURT OR BY JURY 545 See - 296 no opportunity thereafter to explain, expose fallacies, or remove the spell of an emotional appeal, is regarded as giv ing a very distinct advantage to the side which acquires it. (II) The Opening Statement — Its Scope and Content. — As a preliminary to the intro duction of the evidence, the plaintiff’s coun sel, or that side which has the Affirmative of the Issue, and from w hom Proof is first re quired, has the right to make an Opening Statement. He briefly sets forth the issues of the ease as presented in the Pleadings,"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"Page 569 of 735 states what is admitted and what is disputed there under, gives an outline of the main points he expects t o prove in support of his case, and attempts to show what bearing the evidence will have on the points he intends to estab lish. After this prologue, he then proceeds to call his Witnesses and to introduce his Docu mentary Evidence. The defendant may rese rve his Opening Statement until after the close of the plain tiff’s evidence, or it may be made immedi ately after the Opening Statement by the plaintiff, in order to place the issues before the Jury at the outset. The Evidence (I) Methods of Production - of Evidence. — The mode of offering testimony is generally by Witnesses who are present in Court and testify Orally before the Jury, though in all the states there are provisions under which, in certain circumstances, the evidence of Material Witnesses may be taken before the Trial, reduced to wrtting and certified by a proper Officer, and thus used at the Trial without the appearance of the Witnesses themselves, Where Witnesses testify Orally, they are first questioned by the Counsel for the Party producing them, which is called the “Direct Examination” or “Examination - in - Chief”, and then by the Opposing Counsel, which is called the “Cross - Examination,” and perhaps again by the former, which is known as the “Re - Direct Examination,” and by the latter, which is known as “Re - Cross Exami nation,” (II) The Examination of Witnesses: (A) The Oath of Witness. — When a Witness is called, before he takes his seat in the witness stand, the Clerk of the Court Administers the Oath that “the evidence that you shall give to the Court and Jury, touching the matters in question, shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So help you God!” (B) The Direct Examin - ation, — The wit ness, having asserted to the Oath, the Counsel producing th e Witness then proceeds with what is called the Direct Examination. He usually begins by asking the Witness his name, residence, business, and other prelimi nary matters, and then he proceeds to extract the desired information, He may do this ei ther by pl ying the Witness with successive questions, or instead of requiring answers to specific questions, by permitting the Witness to tell his own story uninterrupted and un guided by questions from Counsel. The ad vantage of the second method is that it gives t he opposition less opportunity to know be forehand what evidence is to be offered, and hence lessens the likelihood of the Examina tion being interrupted by captious objections, designed to weaken the impact of the evi dence upon the minds of the Jurors.’ 9 It is the duty of the Court to exercise a reasonable control over the Mode of Exam ination and the Scope of the Evidence offered. Leading Questions, or questions so framed as to suggest to the Witness the desired answer, may elicit answers based on Couns el’s sug gestion, rather than on the Witness’ own knowledge. Questions which obviously in struct the Witness as to the tenor of his re ply, are, on this ground, generally objection able. However, in dealing with a hostile Wit ness, as on Cross - Examination, the bias and 19. On the art of examining a Witness on the Stand, see John C. Reed’s “The Conduct of Lawsuits.” 546 LITIGATING THE CONTROVERSY € 1. 2~. reluctance of the Witness removes much of the danger of suggestion from Leading Ques tions. It is proper for the Court or Jurors to put additional questions to elicit the facts upon which they desire fuller knowledge. (C) The Cross - Ex.amination. — Each Wit ness is not only subject to Direct Examina tion by the side which produced him; he is also subject to Cross - Examination by the op posite party, for the purpose of extracting his whole knowledge and to test its credit and significance before he leaves the stand. Ac cording to Dean Wigmore, a most distin guished authority in Evidence, “the b elief that no safeguard for testing the value of human statements is comparable to that fur nished by cross - examination, and the convic tion that no statement(unless by special ex - ception) should be used as testimony until it has been probed and sublimated by that test, has found increasing strength in lengthening experience. Not even the abuses, the mis handlings, and the puerilities which are so often found associated with Cross - Examina tion have availed to nullify its value. It may be that in more than o ne sense it takes the place in our system which torture occupied in the mediaeval system of the civilians. Nev ertheless, it is beyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.” 20"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"Page 570 of 735 (D) The Advantages and Danger of Cross Examination. - . — Cross - Examination is effec tive, because it exposes falsehood and inac curacies, and beats out the truth, by disclos ing the ability and willingness of the Witness to declare the truth, his opportunity to ascer tain the facts, his powers of observation and memory, his situation and motives, and by fixing the Witness as to all the minute details of time and place. It is very difficult to make a fabricated story agree with all the circum stances. Truth alone will match all arOund. But Cross - E xamination often is a two - edged sword, for it may extract the most unfavor able and damaging facts, confirming the op ponent’s case, demonstrating the Witness’ credibility, or supplying fatal gaps which the opponent had left in his Proof. Methods of Withd rawing the Ca~se from the Jury AT Common Law, in the course of a Trial by Jury, the respective functions of the Judge and Jury were apportioned, the General Rule being that the Court decided the Law and the Jury the Facts, although this is not invari ably true. From this practice, it follows logically that where the plaintiff failed to produce legally relevant evidence at the Trial, the matter might be withdrawn from the Jury. And the classic Common - Law pro cedural device for securing this end was the Demur rer to the Evidence. (I) The Demurrer to the Evidence:” (A) In GeneraL — A Demurrer to the Evi dence is analogous to a Demurrer in Pleading, and it operates to withdraw a case from the Jury. It questions the sufficiency of the Evi dence in Point of Law, and calls for the opin ion of the Court upon the legal effect of the facts shown in evidence. And, for this pur pose, it admits all the facts presented in the 21.

But if he wishes to contradict it, he must resort to the Jury. This step is taken only in cases in which it is Very clear that the evidence has no tend ency to prove the case; and naturally it is not often resorted to, for it is generally unsafe for a party to rest his case solely upon the test of what the evidence tends to prove — a mat ter often difficult to determine. The Party Demurring must obviously be the one holding the Negative of the Issue, as the result of the case must, as a General Rule, be in his favor, unless the Affirmative is proved against him. The effect of the proceeding is to determine the question whether the plaintiff’s evidence shows a prima facie case or right of action.’ 3 The Demurrer to the Evidence withdraws from the Jury the Application of the Law to the Facts, as in the case of a Special Verdict. On a Demurrer to the Evidence or Motion for Nonsuit, no Objection can be made to the Pleadings.’ 4 (B) In the Several St at es. — In many States, the practice of Demurring to the Evi 22.

United States, 2 ’ originally approved the rule as to admissions by Demurrer applied in the English case of Cocksedge v. Fans.haw, 25 to the effect that “by the Demurrer, the de fendant admits every fact which the Jury could have found upon the evidence.” 29 But some five years later, in 1813, in the case of Young v. Black, 30 the Supreme Court, speak ing through Mr. Justice Story shifted to the rule as enunciated in Gibson v. Hunter. 3 ’ In that case, decided in 1793, the Court held that where the testimony was oral and loose and indeterminate, or circumstantial, the plaintiff was not required to join in the De murrer except where there was a specific ad mission in t he Demurrer of every fact which the evidence conduced to prove. Thereafter, unless the plaintiff voluntarily joined in the Demurrer, the issue as to whether the Jury could have found the facts was no longer the subject of the inquiry; if the evidence at al l conduced to prove the facts, those facts had to be admitted on the Record.

In consequence of this division of view as to the Demurrer to the Evidence in the United States Supreme Court, some States followed the more liberal rule of the Cocksedge Case, while others followed the stricter rul e of the Gibson Case. Virginia developed an unorthodox view which included deferring the Demurrer until both Parties had completed their evidence. 33 This practice was adopted in West Virginia, 34 where it was further distorted by allowing the Court, in cert ain situations, to determine the sufficien cy of the Demurrer on the preponderance of the evidence. 35 As thus modified, in Virginia and West Virginia, the Demurrer to the Evi dence still flourished.

At Common Law, a Nonsuit was not granted without the plain tiff ’s consent, and the Court had no power to order a Nonsuit where the plaintiff insisted on a submission of a case to the Jury. But now, in many Jurisdictions, a Court may grant a Motion for a Nonsuit where the plain tiff’s evidence fails to make out a p;’in ic: facic case. Broadly speaking, a Nonsuit is a Judgment given against the plaintiff when he is unable to prove his case, or when he neglects or re fuses to proceed to Trial. And Nonsuits are of two descriptions: 1. The Vountary Non - suit, which is an abandonment of his cause by the plaintiff either before the Trial is commenced, or during the presentation of his case; and 2. The Involuntary Nonsuit, w hich is a Judgment ordered by the Court where the plaintiff fails to appear, or where he has given no evidence on which a Verdict in his favor can be rendered.

Accordingly, after the Arguments, the Judge Orally Charges the Jury, and Jays down the Rules of Law which they are to apply to the Facts proved in rendering their Verdict for one or the other Party. The Judge will ordinarily state the Nature of the Action and Defense, the Points in Issue, what the plaintiff must prove to recover, and what rules will apply to the different states o f fact which may possibly be established in the Opinion of the Jury. (II) Restrictions on the Charge. — At Com mon Law the Judge was under slight re straint in guiding the Jury. He could sum up the evidence, observing where the main issue lay, stating what evidence had been given to support it, and giving them his opin ion on the credibility of the Witnesses and the weight and effect of the evidence — e.g., that the defendant’s case was a very “thin” one; but under our practice in the United States such commen t, even if correct, would be regarded as an invasion of the Province of the Jury, and as such Reversible Error.

It is almost universally pro vided that Judges may not Charge Juries with respect to Matters of Fact, but may sum up the testimony and Declare the Law. The Judge is not to state abstract principles of Law, but should state the Law concretely as applied to different conceivable theorie s of thc case, and instruct the Jury to find for the plaintiff or defendant according to one hy pothesis or another. He may lay down the Rules by which the credibility of the Wit nesses in general is to be judged, and where there is no Evidence or where a fact is ad mitted he may so state; but he cannot indi cate his opinion as to what the Evidence proves, and the Jury is thus deprived of the benefit of his training and exuerience. (III) Requests to Charge — It is the duty of the Judge to Instruct the Jury, upon prop er request, as to the correct decision, assum ing any reasonable hypothesis in relation to the Facts in Evidence, and it is error for the Court to refuse any instruction which cor rectly Declares the Law, framed on a theory pertinent to the case. These requests"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"Page 574 of 735 may be presented to the Judge before or during Ar gument, but should be made in such time as will give the Judge opportunity to examine and pass upon them without delaying the Trial. There seems to bc no limitation on the number or length o f the instructions which may be requested. Very few Lawyers are competent to write an elaborate Set of In structions without committing errors which might conceivably mislead the Jury, and in the hurry of a Trial the ablest Judge may mistake the Law and mi sdirect the Jury; yet a Verdict for the plaintiff, obtained upon er roneous instructions, is practically worthless. This is one of the most serious abuses con. nected with Jury Trials. Exceptions for er rors in giving, refusing, or modifying instruc tions should be taken before the retirement of the Jury, and should specifically point out the ones objected to. In some States excep tions may be entered at any time before En try of Final Judgment. The Deliberations of the Jury THE Jury, after the Charge, unless the case be very clear, withdraws from the Ear to deliberate upon their Verdict. After the case was finally submitted to them, they could not separate, but were kept in charge of a Bailiff or Officer of the Court, duly sw orn to attend them, but this is not always the case in Modern Practice. Ry the old English Prac tice they were to be kept without meat, drink, fire, or candle, unless by permission of the Judge, till they were unanimously agreed, a method of accelerating u nanimity which is now given up. Formerly, if they did not agree in their Verdict before the Judges left town, they might be carried around the Cir cuit from town to town in a cart. Now, if it appears to the Court that they cannot agree, they are Discharged , and the case must be re tried. The Court is not permitted to coerce the Jury into finding a Verdict, and should refrain from anything savoring of a threat as to how long the Jury will be kcpt together unless a Verdict is rendered. 4 ’ The Verdict (I) The General Verdict — Its Form and Tenor. — The Verdict, regardless of its char acter, must be responsive to the Issue sub mitted for Trial. At the Pleading Stage, in connection with the Development of the Common - Law Forms of Action, two inflexi ble rules of plead ing grew up, one, that the Charge in the Declaration must correspond with the Charge in the Original Writ; two, that the Charge proved at the Trial must correspond with the Charge in the Declara tion. It follows, therefore, that the Rule that the Issue fou nd by the Verdict must cor 41, Alabama: DeJarnette v. Cox, 128 Ala. 518, 29 S. 618 (1900); Massachusetts: Highland Foundry Co. v. N.

And, of course, the Judgment must correspond with the Issue as found by the Verdict. By these devices the procedure at Common Law, both in the Pleading and Trial Stages, was able to secure what, in English Composition, in rela tion to writing a paragraph, we refer to as unity and coherence. The General Verdict is in general terms, that is, merely “for the plaintiff” or “for the defendant.” If it is returned for the plain tiff, it contains a Finding as to the Amount of D amages to which the Jury thinks him en titled, where Damages are claimed in the ac tion. At Common Law, the Rule of Unanimity, made it essential that the Jurors must be in complete agreement as to the Verdict.

The situation in respect to the Special Verdict is like that when the Trial is by the Court, in which case the Judge is not permitted to make a General Finding of Fact and Law, as in a General Verdict, without separate findings on the par ticular issues raised. Under Modern Statutory Provisions, how ever, Special Questions, stating Each Point Separately, may be framed and submitted by the Court on request of Counsel, which the Jury must answer before their discharge, so that the true legal significance of Ascer tained Facts may be declared by the Cour t. It is thus possible to see how the Facts are determined, whether the Law is properly ap plied, and how the Special Findings harmo nize with the General Conclusion. (111) The Effect of a Variance Between the Charge and the Proof. — As observed above, the Verdict must be responsive to the Issue as made by the Pleadings and as sub mitted for Trial. It was, therefore, essential for the Party upon whom rested the Burden of Proof to establish by Adequate Proof the Substance of the Issue in his favor. Of course, if there was a Total Failure of Proof, it became the duty of the Jury to Find the Issue in favor of the opposite party. When, however, there was a discrepancy between what the plaintiff alleged in his Declaration and what he proved at the Trial, the discr ep - ancy was called a Variance. Thus, if A al leged that B took his black horse, to which B pleaded Not Guilty, and at the Trial A of fered evidence that B took his white horse, with a black front forefoot, B could Move for a Nonsuit on the ground of a Va riance. Such - a Variance at Common Law was as fatal to the party bearing the Burden of Proof as if there were a Total Failure of Evidence, as the Jury is bound to find against him upon such discrepancy between the Issue and the Proof."},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"Page 576 of 735 (W) The Rule Nisi. — A fter a Verdict at the Nisi Prius Trial, the Party against whom the Verdict has been rendered, may obtain a “RuJe Nisi,” as, for example, to set aside the Verdict and Enter a Nonsuit, which, in effect, is an Order by the Court to the Adverse Par ty to show cause why such relief should not be granted. Upon Motion and Argument of the question, if the Court grants the relief requested, it makes (as it is said) the Rule Absolute. If, however, the Court denies the Motion, it (as it is said) Discharges the Rule, w hich means that the party who obtained the Rule Nisi should obtain nothing. (V) A Special Case, or Reservation of a Point — Whether a Jury shall return a Gen eral or Special Verdict is a matter entirely in its own option. The party objecting in Point of Law cannot therefore insist on a Special Verdict, hence he may be compelled to Demur to the Evidence, if he desires to make the ob jection a Matter of Record, without which no Review may be had on Writ of Error. If, however, his object be merely to obtain a d e eision in the Court in bane at Westminster, he need neither Demur to the Evidence, nor take a Special Verdict, but merely take a General Verdict, subject, as it is said, to a Special Case. A Special Case is a written statement of all the Facts proved at the Trial, drawn up for the opinion of the Court in bane. It is usual ly drawn up by the Counsel and Attorneys on either side, under the direction of the Judge at fl183 prius. The Party for whom the Gen eral Verdict is given, is not entitled to Judg ment until the Court in bane has decided the Special Case. According to the result of that decision, the Verdict is ultimately entered for hint or his adversary. Sec. 297. 298. 299. 300. 301. 302.

On the contrary, it has been seen that, upon a De murrer arising at a later Stage of the Plead ing, the Court will retrospectively consider the sufficiency in Law of Matters to which an answer in Fact has been given. And it has al so been shown that, even after an Issue of Fact and Verdict thereon, the Court is bound to give Judgm ent on the whole record, based upon an examination of the legal sufficiency of all Allegations, throughout the whole se ries of the Pleadings. It follows, therefore, that advantage may be often taken by either party of a legal insufficiency in the Pleading of the other side, either by Motion in Arrest of Judgment, Motion for Judgment Non Ob stante Veredicto, or Writ of Error, according to the circumstances of the Case, although he has answered instead of Demurring, provided the Case is not one within the ex ceptions above noted, and which will now be ex plained; that is, provided the fault is not cured by the subsequent Pleading, or cured or Aided by Verdict, or by a Statute requiring the objection to be raised at a particular Stage of the Proceeding. AIDER BY PLEADING OVER: WITHOUT VERDICT 298. If the party wishes to Plead, instead of Demurring, and still preserve his right of ob jection to a defective adverse Pleading, he must so frame his own Pleading as to avoid waiver of such defects by the formation of a complete issue. A defect in Pleading is Aided if the adverse party Plead Over to or answer the defective Pleading in such a manner that an informality or omission therein is supplied or rendered formal or intelligible. A defect of this character may be thus supplied either: (I) Expressly, or (II) By Implication. Aider Defined ASSUMING that a Pleading is either for mally or substantially defective, any subse quent Act in the course of the litigation which supplies, waives or otherwise rectifies the error in the Pleading, whether it be one •of Commission or omission, is an Aider. Thus, for example, to maintain an Action of Trover the plaintiff must allege Posse ssion or Right to Immediate Possession, Wrongful Act of Conversion and Damages. Suppose, however, he omits the Allegation as to Possession or Right to Immediate Possession. If, at the next succeeding Stage of Pleading, the de fendant, by his Plea, supplies the missing Al legation of Possession or Right to Immediate"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"Page 578 of 735 Possession, the defect in the plaintiff’s Decla ration is said to be Aided or cured. The Modes of Aider were five in number, three of which operated in advance of any Verdict and independent the reof, whereas two came into play after Verdict and only by reason of the Verdict. For purpose of dis cussion, therefore, we may say that we have two types of Aider, to wit, Aider without Ver dict and Aider by Verdict 2 Aider Without Verdict — By Subsequent P leading PRIOR to a Verdict and independent of a Verdict, defects in a Pleading may be cured in one or more of three possible ways, the Mode of Aider being dependent upon the character of the defect. (I) By Pleading Oven — As we have seen, after the Statute of Elizabeth (1585) and the Statute of Anne (1705), all Defects in Form not made the subject of a Special Demurrer were Aided. If the Adverse Party failed to Demur at all or entered a General Demurrer, or Pleaded over Matter of Fact, he automati cally waived the Formel Defect in the Plead ing and thereafter could not take advantage of such insufficiency upon any Demurrer at 2. This division of the topic is borrowed directly from ICeigwin, Cases in Common Law Pleading, Bk. II , - e. III, Aider of Defects 494 (24 ed. Rochester, 1934). Sec. 298 AlDER AND AMENDMENT 555 any Subsequent Stage of the Pleadings, 3 and obviously not after Verdict. In the Anon y nzaus case, Holt, Chief Justice, in referring to Objections in Form, said that “if a man Pleads Over, he shall never take advantage of any slip committed in the Pleading of the other side, which he could not take advantage of upon a General Demurrer.” ~ (II) By Express Averment . — Where a Substantive Allegation of Fact is Omitted from a Declaration or Other Pleading, and in the Next Succeeding Stage in Pleading is sup plied by the Adverse Party, such subsequent statement operates to cure the Defect in th e Original Pleading. Thus, in the famous case of Brooke v. Brooke, 6 A brought Trespass for taking a hook, but failed to allege possession. B Pleaded that while going over A’s land, over which he had a right of way, he met A and took the hook out of his han ds. On Mo tion in Arrest of Judgment, the Court held that the defendant by his Special Plea had cured the Declaration by supplying the Miss ing Allegation of Possession. And so, in La - ~.

And likewise where a plaintiff purports to Sue as a Personal Representative, that is, as an Ad minis trator or Executor. And a General Al legation of a “good and valuable considera tion” in the Contract Field, or that the plain tiff was injured “by the negligent operation of the defendant’s engine’, in the Tort Field, may be waived by a General Demurrer, or taken advantage of upon a Special Demurrer; but if the Adverse Party fails to Demur for insufficiency, or to take Issue upon an Ill - Pleaded Allegation, and Pleads to other Facts stated in the Pleading, the Ill - Pleaded Fact will stand Admitted by Implica tion as a re sult of ignoring it and taking Issue upon a Collateral Matter.

But, says Professor Keig win, “in Buckland v. Otley, 13 . - . al though there was a Verdict, the Declaration was said to be made good by the Mere Plead ing of a Collateral Plea; and in Cutler v. $outhern,’ 4 there was no Verdict at all, and the bad Pleading as to Cook’s Suit was held on Demurrer to be waived by the defendant’s Pleading to something else.

A VERDICT is rendered by a Jury, Im paneled and sworn for the Trial of a Cause, upon which Evidence is presented by Both Parties, and it is reported to the Court, upon Issues duly submit ted to the Jury upon the Trial. As a result of the Trial, on the basis of Evidence presented, the ease as presented by the Pleadings may be supplemented. Thus, the Evidence may supply matters not previously disclosed, make clear Facts which were left in do ubt by the Allegations in the Pleadings, and clarify other Issues not clear ly presented in the Pre - Trial Proceedings. Under such circumstances certain Deficien cies in the Pleadings may be Aided by a Ver dict, operating by either one of Two Meth ods, whic h are diverse in character. In one situation the remedial effect of the Verdict is the result of the Common Law Principle of Intendment After Verdict; in the other the Aider by Verdict flows directly from the ef fect of a Series of Statutes, known as the S tat utes of Jeofails. Aider by the Common Law Principle of Intendment after Verdict, and Aider by virtue of the Statutes of Jeofails, constitute the Fourth and Fifth Modes of Aid er, which will now be considered in their re spective order, Aider by the Common Law Principle of In tendment After Verdict WHERE, iii setting forth a Cause of Action or a Defense, as the case may be, a Pleader fails to allege a Fact sufficiently or to ade quately state a right, no presumption arises to validate his Fact or to complete his right. Sec. 299 AIDER AND AMENDMENT 557 In fact, as the Pleader is presumed to tell his side of the controversy in the light most f a vorable to himself, the presumption is that any failure to sufficiently state what is essen tial to make out his case is to be attributed to the circumstance that the Omitted Facts did not exist. However, in the case of Hitchin v. Stevens, 15 where the purchaser of a rever sion brought an Action of Debt for rent, but alleged no attornment, the defendan t pleaded Nil Debet, and there was a Ver dict for the plaintiff, whereupon the defend ant Moved in Arrest of Judgment on the ground that the plaintiff had insufficiently set forth his title to the rent, having failed to allege an attornment, the Court held that in any case where anything is Omitted in a Declaration, even though it be Matter of Sub stance, 16 if it be such as, without proving it at the Trial, the Court could not have had a Verdict, and there be a Verdict for the plain tiff, such Omission shal l not Arrest the Judg ment. Accordingly, Judgment was Entered for tIme plaintiff. The Verdict thus placed the case in a different light; the Fact of Title having been imperfectly alleged, because of 15. 2 Show.K.B. 233, 89 Eng.Rop. 909 (1682). 16. But co mpare Da costa v. Clarke, 2 B. & P. 257, 126 Eug.Rep. 1265 (1500), where the court held that an imperfect Averment of a Material Fact was not Aided by Verdict in favor of the pleader In such a case, before the Rule can operate, there must be a sufficient A verment to serve as a peg to hang the omitted matter on, [See opinion of Buluer, J., in Spiers v. Parker, 1 T.R. 141, 99 Eng.Rep. 1019 (1786)1, or, stated otherwise, there must be at least a partial statement of a substantive fact before any presumption wi ll arise that the circumstances requisite to a complete statement were in reality proved at the Trial. For an instructive statement and application of the principle, see Wills v. Claflin, 92 U.S. 135, 23 LEd. 490 (1875). See, also, Alabama: Contorno V. Ens ley co., 211 Ala. 211, 100 So. 127 (1924); Illinois: Miller v. Kresge Co., 309 III. 104, 137 N.E. 385 (1922); New York: Sherwood v. Chace, 11 Wend, (N.Y.) 381 (1833).

From this flowed a presumption that at the Trial the plaintiff Proved the Allegations, though not correctly stated, which were essential to make out the Ultimate Fact o f Title. To the Common Law Principle of Intend ment After Verdict there were two limita tions: (I) Where There is no Peg to Hang the Omitted Matter On. — Where the Defective Pleading sought to be"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"Page 581 of 735 Aided by Verdict un der the Principle of Intendment contains no Averment at all, imperfect or otherwise, of the Ultimate Fact required to establish the Pleader’s Case, no presumption can arise that the Fact was proved, and it follows logi cally that the Verdict cannot Aid the Com plete Omission. The same idea has f requent ly been expressed in the statement that a Verdict will cure a Defective Statement of a Good Title, but not the Statement of a Defec tive Title; in other words, as Professor Keig win observed: “The Verdict will supplement an Incomplete Pleading, but will not supply a Total Want of Averment.” 17 Although one who alleges an imperfect case is entitled to a Verdict if he proves the Facts as alleged, obtaining a Verdict affords no presumption that he has proved what he has failed to allege at least by imp lication, or to some extent by suggestion - Thus, in the case of Buxendin v. Sharp) 8 where the plaintiff alleged that the 11. Cases in Common - Law Pleading, Bk. II, c. Ill, Aider of Defects, 495 (2d ed., Rochester 1934). But see, Skinner v, Gunton, 1 Wins. Saund. 229, 85 Engilep. 249 (169W, in which it was held that a Dec laration in case for Malicious Prosecution, which omitted an Allegation that the former proceed ing had ended, was Aided by a Verdict for the plain tiff. But a failure to allege want of probable cause constitutes a substantive defect, and hence presum ably would not be Aided by Verdict. Dennehey v.

Under such circum stances the Verdict raises no presumption that the Ill - pleaded Fact was made effective by the evidence produced at the Trial. For example, if in a Declaration in Special As sumpsit, the Consideration is Defectively Al leged, and the defendant Pleads the Statute of Limitations, since No Issue is taken on the Fact of Consideration, no Proof is required, and hence a Verdict for the plaintiff does not Aid the Defective Statement of the Consid eration on the theory that the evidenc e at the Trial supplied any Omitted Element. Cases of this charactel’ therefore do not fall within the scope of the Common Law Principle of Intendment after Verdict. It may be, how ever, that such cases may fall within the pur view of that series of Remedi al Enactments known as the Statutes of Jeofails. THE STATUTES OF JEOFAILS 300. As a result of the English Statutes of Jeofails, beginning in 1340 and extending down to Modern Times, there has been a gradual liberalization of the earlier strict policy against permitting Free Amendments of Pleadings, 19. English: Jackson v. Pesked, 1 M. & 8. 234, 105 Eng.Jlep. 88 (1513); Alabama: Douglas v. Beasley, 40 Ala. 142 (1866); Illlaois: Chicago & A. R. Co. v. Clausen, 173 Ill. 100, 50 N.E. 680 (1898). AFTER the appearance of Written Plead ings, and after the proceedings in any given case were Entered on Record, at Common Law, or prior to the grant of Statutory Au thority, the Courts would permit no further Amendments. This resulted in many liti gants losing their cases when they were clear ly entitled to win as a matter of substance. They were accordingly left without remedy. To meet this situation Parliament gradually began to provide a piecemeal remedy in a series of Enactments now known as the Stat utes of Jeofails. Most of the ensuing Stat utes, enacted between the years 1340 and 1705, appli ed to Errors which called for cor rection after Trial, but two of them, the Stat ute of Elizabeth (1585) and the Statute of Anne (1705), applied to the Record before Verdict. According to Plucknett, 2 ° efforts to im prove the System of Special Pleading, wh ich tended to become more rigid as time went on, by the Enactment of Statutes of Jeofails, be gan in the early Fourteenth Century. And Professor Samuel Tyler, in his Preface to Ste~ phen, 2 ’ stated: “No less than Tsvelve Stat utes, beginning in the Reign of Edward III [1327 - 4377], and coming down to that of George I [1714 — 1727], had been passed by Parliament before"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"Page 582 of 735 we separated from Eng land, to remedy tcchnical inconveniences.” AMENDMENTS 30L A party will generally be allowed to correct Inaccuracies or Supply Omissions in his Pleadings by Amendment at any time be fore the Jury have retired, if he has not been guilty of Ladies in applying for leave to Amend, and if the Amendment does not change the Form of Action, or introduce a New Cause of Action or Ground of Defence, or prejudice the Adverse Party. 20.

D. C. 1000). THE Court will generally allow an Amend ment to correct Mistakes in the Names of the Parties, 22 or to strike out Parties Im properly Joined, 23 or bring in Parties Im properly Omitted, or who have become Nec essary Partie s since Commencement of the Suit, 24 or to correct the Pleading as to the Capacity in which a Party Sues or is Sued. 25 And an Amendment is frequently allowed in order to Conform the Pleadings to the Proof that has been offered, so as to avoid a Van ancë, wh ere no prejudice to the Opposite Party can result. It is always safer to apply for Leave to Amend before Issue Joined, or at least before the Thal has Commenced, for the Court may refuse to allow an Amendment after that time. 2 ° A Party cannot insist upon a right to Amend if he has been guilty of Laches. 2 The Court may, however, in the exercise of its discretion, allow Amendments at any time before the Jury have retired, if it properly protects the Other Party, 28 and some Amend - merits, as Amendments to Conf orm to Proof, may be allowed after Verdict, and even after Judgment. 2 ° 22.

Amendments to Ciwn - ge the Form of Action UNDER the Common Law a plaintiff was not permitted to Amend his Declaration if it operated to change the Form of the Action, as from Assumpsit to Covenant, or from Case to Trespass. 3 ° There was a sensible reason for such a holding. The Rule was that the Charge in the Declaration had to conform to the Charge in the Original Writ as is sued out of Chancery. If there was a Vari - ance between the two, it was ground for a Plea in Abatement. Thus, if A sued out an Original Writ in Debt, his Declaration was but an Amplification of the Charge of Debt as set forth in the Writ. Naturally, an attempt to Amend his Declaration to Cove nant would be Error, as Covenant did not fall within the scope of the Charge of Debt as Stated in the Original Writ. Nor could such a Defect be waived by agreement of the Par ties. 31 Even where an Amendment would otherwise be permissible, it should not be al lowed if it would result in prejudice to the Ad - 30.

The Situation Under Modern Law as to Amendment Changing the Form of Ac tion - IN England, as earlier observed, as long as the Original Writ operated, an Amend ment changing the Form of Action was fatal. But with the abolition of the Original Writ in 1833,~~ Amendments were permitted in the discretion of the Court. In New Hamp shire, in the case of Stebbin s v. Lancashire Ins. Co., 34 the Court followed this liberal Eng lish view, but in the Several States of the United States, despite the fact that Original Writs were not used, Amendments chang ing the Form of Action have been frequently disallowed. 35 With the abolition of the Forms of Action after 1848, all reasons for observing the Rule prohibiting Amendments changing the Form of Action ceased to exist, and it would seem that the Code States might have followed the liberal view in pennitting amendments. Bu t according to Professor Scott, “this rule was replaced by one which is even worse.” It was held that an Amendment could not be allowed if it changed the Cause of Action. “This is in many ways a more sweeping limi tation upon the power of the Court than th e Common - Law Rule.” ~ Fortunately, this de parture from the ways of Good Pleading was 32.

This was provided for in Wisconsin under its Code. 38 As Winslow, J . said, in Jilek v. Zahi? in re ferring to the purpose of the Wisconsin Stat ute: “The beneficent effect of this provision can hardly be overestimated. It means that ft will no longer be necessary to kick the plaintiff out the back door of the Courtroom (w ith Costs) in order that he may re - enter by the front door in a different garb.” Amendment and the Statute of Limitations IF an Amendment imtroduces into the Dec laration a New and Different Cause of Action from the One Originally Stated, it is subject to a Plea of the Statute of Limitations, if the Statutory Period had run against the claim. And this is true although the Statute had not run at the time the Original Action began. But obviously Amendments should be allowed which do not introduce a New Cause of Action, but"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"Page 584 of 735 where the Allegations merely amplify or vary the claim set up in the Original Count, md this is true even where Essential Elements are added.’° The ‘question of the running of the Statute of Limitations and the right to Amend the Declarati on thereafter should never turn up on the question whether the Declaration states a Good Cause of Action. The correct test should be whether the Commencement of the Action constituted fair notice of the assertion of that particular claim. 37. See N. J. Laws, 1912, e. 231; Wis.Stats. § 283Gb (Laws 1915, c. 219, ~ 2). 38. Wis.Stats. 2836b (Laws 1915, e. 219, ~ 2). 39 - 162 WIg. 157, 101, 155 N.W~ 008, 810 (1916). 40. Carlin v.

The Statute of Limitations continued to run in spite of a Defective Declaration. In the case of Walters v. City of Ottawa, 41 an Ac tion was brought against the City for per sonal injuries due to a defective sidewalk, in which the Declaration failed to state that Formal Notice had been given as required by Statute. The City Pleaded the General Issue, but later withdrew this Plea and filed a Demurrer, which was sustained. There upon the plaintiff Amended her Declaration by adding to each Count Averments showing the giving of the Notice in due season, Now, the City again Pleaded the General Issue and added a Plea of the One - Year Statute of Lim itations. A Verdict of $1,000 was rendered against the City, but on Review by th e Su preme Court, the Judgment which had been Entered was Reversed, the Court holding that an Amendment to the Declaration sup plying such Essential Averments more than a year after the injury was open to a Plea of the Statute of Limitations. 42 By the wei ght of authority, to supply one of the Essential Elements of a Cause of Ac tion, does not constitute a New and Sepa 41. 240 Ill. 259, 88 N.E. 651 (1909).

And Amendment after the Limitation Period is permissible, al though the Declaration was Dem urrable, where it perfects the Same Cause of Action Originally Pleaded. That is the only sort of Amendment that is really important. 43 It is well settled that the Statute of Limitations is no Bar to an Amendment of the Declara - tion as to non - essentials. 4~ STATUS OF AIDER AND AMENDMENT — UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES OF COURT 302.

But, under a number of Codes, if it appears that the Amendment wa s for the purpose of delay and that the Adverse Party will be prejudiced, the Amended Plead ing may be stricken out, on such Terms as the Court may deem just. And Some State Stat utes have provided in effect that the Court may permit Amendment of Any Plead ing by addng or striking out the irnine of Any Par ty, or by correcting a Mistake in any other respect; or, provided the Amendment does not substantially change the Claim or De fense, by Conforming the Pleading to the Facts proved. 47 Federal Rule 15(b) pr ovides that when Issues not raised by the Pleadings are tried by express or imphed consent of the Parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the Pleadings. Moreover, even After Judgment, a Party may upon Mo tion Amend his Pleadings to Conform to the Evidence, and failure to so Amend does not affect the result of the Trial of these Issues. And where there is an Offer of Evidence which is objected to at trial on the ground that it is not within the Scope of the Issues as Made by the Pleadings, the Court may al low the Pleadings to be Amended where the Merits of the Action will be subserved and the Objecting Party fails to satisfy the Court ES. Jbl& that the admission of such evidence woult prejudice him. 48 Certain States att empted to Regulate th Form of Amendments. Oregon, for example required an Amended Pleading to be com plete in itself, aside from the Original Plead~ ing; ~° some States required Motions to be in writing and to specifically set forth the words sought to be inserted or stricken out; ~° and in at least one State Amendment was not permitted to be made by erasure or inter lineatlon, a separate paper being required to be filed, and when so filed, to constitute with the Original but a Single Pleading. In the absen ce of statutory requirement, the Form of an Amendment lies within the discretion of the Court In Some States it was required that the Application for Amendment be ac companied by Affidavit stating the reasons therefor. 51"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"Page 586 of 735 Amendments Changing the Cau~se of Action AS we have seen in the earlier discussion of this subject as it stood at Common Law, with the abolition of the Original Writ in England in 1833 and the Forms of Action in New York in 1843, the reasons for not per mitting an Amendment changing the Fo rm of Action ceased to operate. In the Code States where the Statute Regu lating Amendment does not in specific terms restrict the power, it would appear that such unrestricted power should extend far enough to permit an Amendment changing the Cause of Ac tion.

Co. v. ~y7er;~ in which an employee of a railroad was not permitted to shift his claim for Dam ages from the Common Law to a Kansas Statute, a stricter view was assumed, the Court indicating that a “Depar ture from Law to Law” was not permissible. Third, in the more recent case of Missouri, K. c~ T. H. Co. v. Wulf,~ the trend again turned in the direction of liberality, where a Claim Under a Kansas Statute was, as a result of Amendment, converted to a Suit under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. In stead of finding a New Cause of Action, the Court said the change was merely in Form and Not in Substance, In the process of development, the Federal Courts made clear that they had abandoned the restrictive “ Law to Law” rule, and when the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted, they contained no such restriction.~ It may be said, therefore, that the earlier policy of re stricting the Power of Amendment has lost favor, with the Courts generally accepting the broader concept of the Cause of Action as consisting of a Group of Operative Facts. The “Law to Law” test was abandoned in New York as early as 1872,~ and Other States have followed her leadership. 57 New York 52. Chapman v.

Changes in legal theory should be ignored in determining the Issue.

Variance TIlE situation where there is a Varian ce between the Allegations in the Complaint and the Proof at the Trial, is now covered in the Codes by a Statutory Provision, of which an example is Rule 3025(c) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, which pro vides: “Tile Court may permit Pleading s to be Amended before or after Judgment to Conform them to the Evidence, upon such terms as may be just including the granting of costs and continuances.” Defective Pleadings Aided by Statute THE related Section 2001 of the New York Civil Practice Law an d Rules, covering Mis takes, Omissions, Defects and Irregularities in Pleading, provides: “At Any Stage of an Action, the Court may permit a Mistake, Omission, Defect or Irregularity to be cor rected, upon such terms as may be just, or, if a substantial ri ght of a party is not preju - diced, the Mistake, Omission, Defect or Ir regularity shall be disregarded.” Supplemental Pleadings SUPPLEMENTAL Pleadings, as provided for in Statutory Provisions, are usually re stricted to a Statement of Facts which oc curre d after the Filing of the Original Plead ing by the Party. In this sense such Plead ings, strictly speaking, are not Amendments. But they may well fall within this class under those Code Provisions which permit Supple mental Pleadings to set forth Facts wh ich ex isted, but of which the Pleader had no knowl edge, when the Original Pleading was Filed. In any event, the Allowing of such Plead ings, like Amendments, is largely a matter for the discretion of the Court, and the meas ure of their allowance ought t o be whether they result in general in the Furtherance of Justice.° 6 66.

As the Retrospective Motions for a New Trial, for Venire Facias De Novo, for Ar rest of Judgment, for Judgment Notwith standing the Verdict, and for a Repleader, come after Verdict and before Judgment, it is essential to understand that Judgment does not i mmediately follow Rendition of a Ver dict. It is suspended for a short period of time to permit the Losing Party at the Nisi Prius Trial to examine the Pleadings in order to determine whether the Matters Alleged by the Prevailing Party are sufficient to su stain a Judgment on the Verdict, and to examine the Conduct of the Trial with reference to rulings of the Court and other conduct which might invalidate the Verdict. 1 - in general, 01) the subject of the Retrospective Motions, see: TreatIses: 2 Tidd, The Praetiee of the Court of King’s Bench in Personal Actions, e.

Thus, for example, if A sues B in Case for Slander, alleging that B spoke of and con cerning A, stating that A is a liar, A is not entitled to recovery, even though a Jury finds the Facts as A alleged, if the alleged state ment is derogatory language which, as a Mat ter of Substantive Law, is not actionable even ii proven.

As a Verdict is therefor not necessarily decisive of the Cause, th Court, in conside ring an appropriate Motior should thoroughly examine the Pleadings fo: the purpose of ascertaining whether the Fact: alleged by the victorious Party will sustain Judgment in his favor. And in some caset the conduct of the Trial may have to be con sidered, particularly with reference to th Rulings of the Court on offers and rejections of evidence, some of which may operate to invalidate a Verdict. To meet these even~ tualities and to give an opportunity for the losing party to examine the Record and the Tria l, at Common Law the Entry of the Judgment was delayed. This resulted in Eng lish Practice from the circumstance that Nisi Prius Trials were usually held out on the Circuit away from Westminster, during a Vacation of the Court, and therefore the Record Rol l, with the Entry of the Ver dict, could not be presented to the Full Court for Judgment, until after the Commencement of the Next Term. Within four days after the Court met En Bane at Westminster. the Losing Party at the Nisi Prius Trial was permitted any Motion seeking to avoid the Judgment which in the normal course of affairs would logically follow upon a Ver dict. 3 A similar Rule has usually been fol lowed in the American Courts, except where changed by Rule of Court or Statute. - 1 The effort to avert t he Entry of Judgment on the Verdict took the Form of One or More Motions, which, as Professor Keigwin ob serves, “because they look backward over the course of the proceeding, may be called Re trospective Motions,” ~ which were Five in 3.

MATTER OF RECORD VERSUS MATTER OF EXCEPTION 304. Four out of five of the Retrospective Motions are addressed to Errors Apparent Up on the Face of the Common - Law Record. The • Common - Law Record consists of the Process, the Pleadings, the Verdict and the Judgment. After Judgment, such Errors were Reviewable by Writ of Error. Errors which occurred at the Trial were not part of the Common - Law Record, and could be Reviewed by a Motion for a New Trial, after Verdict and before Judg ment; by Statute, such Errors could be Re viewed after judgment by incorporating them into the Record by means of a Bill of Excep tions. It was therefore essentia l to keep clear ly in mind the distinction between Matter of Record and Matter of Exception. UNDER the ancient practice, the Proceed - ings in a litigated case were Entered upon the Parchment Roll, and when this was completed, the end product became known a s the Common - Law Record. It consisted of Four Parts, the Process, which included the Original Writ and the Return of the Sheriff, by which the Court acquired Jurisdiction over the defendant; the Pleadings, presented by the Parties in the prescribed order to develop an Issue of Law or of Fact, and which includ ed the Declaration and all subsequent Plead ings, together with the Demurrers, if any; the Verdict; and the Judgment, These Four Elements formed the Co mmon - Law Record, but it should be observed that at the point where the Retrospective Motions come into 567 play, the Record has not been developed be yond the Stage of Entering the Verdict upon the Roll. At this point it should also be recalled that betw een the time when the Pleadings Termi nated in an Issue, which Joinder in Issue was duly Recorded on the Parchment Roll, and the time when an Entry of the Verdict was made, nothing was Recorded on the Parch ment Roll. The reason for this was that be tween the Joinder of Issue and the Rendition of the Verdict, the Trial takes place, and what occurs during this Trial does not Appear upon the Face of the Common - Law Record. Thus, Offers and Rejection of Evidence, the Court’s Instruction of the Jury, or its Refu sal to Instruct as requested by Counsel, or any Misconduct Connected with the Trial, such as Prejudicial Remarks on the Part of the Court, and the like — that is — any Error that occurs at the Trial — cannot be corrected by resort to the Common - Law Record becaus e not Ap parent Upon its Face. Such Errors were pre served only in the notes made by the Presid ing Judge, or in his memory, and were review - able, after Verdict and before Final Judg ment, by a Motion for New Trial made before the Court En Bane at Westmins ter, within four days after the Commencement of the Next Term following the Rendition of the Verdict. As each of the Judges of the Court had Motions of a similar character coming up for decision from the Trials over which they had presided, the natural inc lination of each Judge was to support the Rulings of his broth er Jurists, and thus Overrule the Motion for a New Trial. Furthermore, Errors that oc curred at the Trial were not Reviewable after Judgment on Writ of Error, because Not Ap parent on any one o f the Four Parts of the Common - Law Record. To remedy this De fect, Parliament enacted Chapter 31 of the Statute of Westminster II in 1285,6 which provided for Review of such Errors through 4 Sec. 304 RETROSPECTIVE MOTIONS Ch. 27 therefore tuse, the Motion dings for the Facts iustain a tie cases be con ? to the ejections ierate to se even - for the and the of the"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"Page 592 of 735 I in Eng hat Nisi on the Luring a fore the he Ver ill Court acement ys after m inster, is Trial to avoid course i a Ver - een fol t where i. 1 The ment on ir More Null oh )ver the led Re - Five in Bk.

Matters extraneous to or outside of the Record could be tested after Verdict and before Judgment only by a M otion for a New Trial. A distinc tion is made between Matter of Record and Matter of Exception, Matter of Record re ferring to those Errors Apparent upon the Face of the Common - Law Record and hence Reviewable after Final Judgment upon a Writ of Error, and Matter of Exception referring to those Errors which Occurred at the Trial, and were Not Apparent on the Face of the Common - Law Record, hence Reviewable aft er Final Judgment only by incorporating such Errors into the Record by means of a Bill of Exceptions , as authorized by Chapter 31 of the Statute of Westminster II in 1285.~ - TIlE MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL 305. A Motion for a New Trial calls for a re - examination by the Court of the occurrences at the Trial to determine whether any errors had been made up on the Trial, or whether any irregularities had occurred in connection with the Trial. A Motion for a New Trial does not reach defects in the Pleadings. New Trial 9 AT Common Law, Proceedings leading to a decision might be corrected or Reviewed after 7.

Its purpose was to have the Court set asid e the Verdict and order a New Trial on the ground that some Error had occurred at the Trial, con - sisting of some alleged Misconduct of the Parties, the Counsel, the Jurors or the Judge.• Prior to 1655, the Law Courts, it was said,• held themselves incompet ent to set aside Ver - dicts, hence the only Remedy available for a Party who had been prejudiced by an improp er Verdict was either by the then impractical Proceeding to Attaint the Jury, or by an Ap peal to a Court of Equity, which, under some - conditions, might procure New Trials. The first case in which it was said a New Trial was• granted at Law, In order to meet the inade quacy of the Courts in refusing to set Verdicts - aside, was Wood v. Ounston,’° decided in 1655. But Lord Mansfield was of the opinion that New Trials were granted at Law at an earlier time?’ Note: New Trial — Exclusiveness Grounds, 5 Minn.L.Ilev. 564 (1921). it Style 466, 82 Eng.Rep. 867(1655). 11.

As the procedure evolved i n the American Courts, the Motion for a New Trial became one which was generally ad - dressed directly to the Judge who conducted the Trial, and sought to persuade him that he had committed some Error in one or more of his Various Rulings during the Trial, o r that for some other reason Justice was not done. it is altogether proper that this Motion should be heard by the very Judge who tried the Case, as he is personally acquainted with the Facts involved, and able to judge as to their bearing upon the merits of the controversy, as well as give them their proper evaluation. And it was for this very reason that it became the established Rule that a Judge in passing upon a Motion for a New Trial exercised his own discretion, which, in general, was not re viewahle in an Anpeilate Court, as the Grant or Refusal of a New Trial could not be As signed as Error in Another Court, While the discretion exercised by the Trial - Court in passing upon a Motion for a New Trial was not ordinarily subject to Appellate Review, it should be observed that some of the Errors urged in support of such a Motion may be and frequently are made the subject of Exceptions, and are thus incorporated into the Record by means of a Bill of Exceptions. In this way the same Errors which are urged below on Motion for a New Trial may be Re viewed by Writ of Error, which brings the Bill of Exceptions to the Appellate Court, or by Statutory Appeal. if the BiU of Exceptions reveals that the Trial Court committed Errors, as in improp erly A&’nitting or Excluding Evidence, or in failing to correctly Instruct the Jury, the Ap peilate Court may, on the ground of such Er rors, Reverse the Judgment and grant a New Trial. Such a Course of Procedure involves no revision of the decision ol’ the Trial Court on th e Motion for New Trial; that which is revised is the Erroneous Ruling which oc curred at the Trial. And the New Trial which is granted, is granted not because the Trial Judge Erred in refusing it, but on the ground that he had previously Erred in his heari ng of the case and with respect to a Matter which Impaired the Validity of the Judgment.’ 2 Grounds for New Trial AT Common Law there was a wide discre tion in the Judge as to the Causes for gran ting a New Trial, and the Statutory Grounds laid down in our Modem Codes and Practice Acts are not exclusive of all others. 13"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"Page 594 of 735 The Grounds for the Motion generally in clude such Errors and Irregularities in the Conduct of the Trial as Errors in Impaneling the Jury, Bribes and Private Communications of th e Prevailing Party to the Jury, which may have influenced their Verdict, or Misbe havior of the Jury in their deliberations, as by intoxication, separation, private investi gations, casting lots or drawing straws for the Verdict, or of the Jury bringing in a Verdict contrary to the weight of the evidence, so that the Judge is reasonably dissatisfied there with, or if the Jury has given Excessive Dam ages indicating passion and prejudice, or if the Judge has erroneously Excluded or Ad mitted Evidence, or Mis directed the Jury on the Law controlling the case, so that in conse quence they may have found an Unjustifiable Verdict; for these and any other reasons, which may amount for Error at the Trial, it is the duty of the Court to award a Retrial if 12.

And, of course, the Motion for a New Trial, should be clearly differentiated from the Mo tion for Veniyc l 7 acian Dc Novo.’ 5 Another Matter for which New Trials are sometimes granted is surprise, where a Party using all diligence and care is placed in a situation injurious to his interests without his own default. 1 ° One may reguiarly Subpoena a Witness, and he may be actually in atten dance, but absent himself at the time when needed, without the knowledge or consent of the Party or his Attorney.

The Motion for Venire Facias Dc Nova was, unlike the Motion for New Trinl, designed to Vacate the Verdict and obtain a Retrial on the basis of Defects Appearing on the Record; and if granted when it should not be, it was Er ror, and the Award of it could be reversed, whereas a Motion for a New Trial was common ly granted after a General Verdict for some Cause not Apparent on the Record, and was not Assignnble for Error, THE Motion for Venire Facias Dc Novo was an Ancient Proceeding o f the Common Law, in use long bc~2ore the Motion for a New Trial. IS. In referring to tile distinction between a Motion for Ve,zire Fades Dc Nero and a Motion for a New Trial, in the ease of Witham v. Lewis, 1 Wils. KB. 48, 55, 05 Eng.llep. 485, 489 (2744), Chief Justice Wilies declared: “Tue Counsel at the Bar endeavored to confound a Ve. Pa.

Be 2~ovo is tile ancient proceedi]sg of the Common Law, a New Trial is only a new invention; the first is as Ancient as the Law, wile’s attuints were in use, but Motions for New Triats were introduced in this manner; the Judgment in Attaint was very severe, and the punisl.nuent ox cessively hard, and therefore to avoid that sever ity it was thought bet icr to prrr - cerl in :1 milder way, and so Motions for New Trials were intro duced, They likewise differ in this respect, that New Trials are generally granted where n General Verdict is found, a Fe.

If granted when it should not be, it was Error, and the Award of it could be reversed, whereas a Motion for a New Trial was com monly granted after a General Verdict and was not assignable for Error. The Motion for Ventrc Fat - ia - s Dc Nova was granted where a Verdict was so imperfect that Judgment could not properly be grounded upon it. 2 ° This might occur where the Verdict was not responsive to the Issue, or where some irreg ularity in the Impaneling of the Jury was involved, provided such insufficiency or ir regularity was Apparent on the Roll. If the Motion to Set Aside the Verdict and to Award a Venis’e Facias Do No - vo was granted, a Writ was then issued requiring the Sheriff to Summon a New Jury to try the Cause. 2 ’ TIlE MOTION IN ARREST OF JUDGMENT"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"Page 596 of 735 307. The Court will generally, on Motion, refuse to Enter Judgment upon a Verdict, De fault, or Demurrer to Evidence, when substan tial Defects exist in the Pleadings or the Ver dict. And the Defect must be at least one w hich would have been fatal on a General Demurrer, and not one which a Verdict would cure; and it must be Apparent on the Face of the Record. If a Declaration shows No Cause of Action whatever, or a Plea is utterly Wanting in Stating a Defense, the Entry of a Judgment clearly cannot be allowed to repre sent what has not been established. And, of course, a Motion in Arrest of Judgment must be made After Verdict and Before Rendition of the Judgment. It operates, with significant differences, as a kind of Delay ed Demurrer. 19. Butcher it. Metts, 1 Miles (D.C.Phila.) 233 (1830). 20. Kcigwin, Cases in Common Law Pleading, Bk. II, The Rules of Pleading, c. XVIII, Retrospective Mo tions, 771 (2d ed. Rochester, 1934). Definition IN Legal Proceedings, a “Motion” is an ap plication, either written or made viva voce, by a Party to an Action or a Suit for some kind of Relief. 22 And a Motion in Arrest of Judgment is a procedural device, entered up on the Record, and is designed to Stay 23 Judgment, or prevent its Ent ry, pending a de termination of whether the Record will sup - port the Judgment. Such a Motion usually occurs after an Issue of Fact has been tried and a Verdict Found, but the Motion is also available after a Default, in which case it is treated exactly as if it had been a Demurrer to the Declaration, and not like a Motion made after Verdict, 24 The Principle Underlying the Motion TUE Theory of the Motion in Arrest of Judgment is that the Judgment of the Court is a Conclusion of Law from all the Facts as cer tained and spread upon the Record, and as such Conclusion must rest upon and be col lected from the Whole Record, the Party who does not, upon the Entire Record, appear entitled to Judgment, cannot have it, Thus, a Substantive Defect is available at the Pl ead ing Stage, by Demurrer; After Verdict and Before Judgment, by Motion in Arrest of Judgment; and After Judgment, by Writ of Error. And this principle holds true even though a Verdict has been found, a Default suffered, or a Demurrer to Evidence deter mi ned in favor of the Party, who, upon the Whole Record, appears not to be entitled to Judgment. For even in the face of such Ver dict, Default or Final Ruling on a Demurrer to Evidence, the Record, as viewed as a whole, may disclose No Right of Action, or n o Legal 22. State it.

And, therefore, if a Verdict is found for the plaintiff, upon a Declaration substantively defective — as in Ejectment in which there is a failure to allege title — or for the defendant, on a Plea in Bar totally void, Judgment must in either case be Arrested. The Motion in Arrest of Judgment, of course, must be made Before Judgment and it operates, with sig n ificant differences, as a kind of Belated De murrer, 2 ° The Question on a Motion in Arrest of Judg ment is One of Lay, THE Motion in Arrest of Judgment raises a Question of Law; it in effect asserts that there is some Error Apparent on the Face of the Reco rd which in Point of Law vitiated the proceedings culminating in the Verdict; that is, Judgments were Arrested only for intrin sic causes. 2 ’ And after the Statutes of Amendments and Jeofails, the Error Manifest upon the Face of the Record was required to be One of Substance and Not One in Form. Defects Available Upon Motion in Arrest of Judgment - UNDER the Ancient Common Law a Mo tion in Arrest of Judgment could reach mere Defects in Form in the Pleadings.

If a"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"Page 598 of 735 Defect is Cured by Verdict, a Motion in - Arrest of Judgment will not be sustained. With respect to such imperfections as are Aided by Verdict at Common Law, it was early observed, “that where there is Any De fect, Imperfection, or Omission in Any Plead ing, whether in SubstanCe or Form, which would have been a Fatal Objection upon De murrer; yet if the Issue Joined be such as necessarily required on the Trial Proof of the Facts so Defectively or Imp erfectly Stated or Omitted, and without which it is not to be pre sumed that either the Judge would Direct the Jury to give, or the Jury would have given the Verdict, such Defect, Imperfection, or Omission, is Cured by the Verdict by the Com mon Law.” ~ An d this Rule has subsequently been followed, 33 28.

Sec. 307 Since after the Statute of Demurrers, 34 in 1585, Supplemented and Amended by the Statute of Anne in l705,~~ Formal Defects in the Record were Waived except on Special Demurrer, it followed that thereafter Judg ment could not be Arrested for any other than a Substantive Defect. Such a fault may be found either in the Pleadings or in the Verdict if one has been rendered. Thus, where the plaintiff has been Awarded a Ver diet on a Declaration Totally Defective in Substance — as where in Trover he fails to al leg e a Conversion — or varies totally from the Original Writ — as where the Writ sued out - - was in Special Assumpsit for Breach of a Con tract and the Verdict was in Case for a Tort — Judgment may be Arrested on the defendant’ s Motion. But if the Declaration was Substan lively Vaiid, and the Plea in Bar on which the defendant obtained a Verdict is Substantively Defective — as where the defendant Pleaded Not Guilty to a Declaration in Assumpsit — the Judgment may in turn be Arrest ed on the Motion of the Plaintiff. 36 In each instance the Defect at which the Motion Struck was in the Pleading. The Defect may, however, be in the Ver dict. Thus, where the Pleadings terminate in a Perfect Issue, but the Jury finds a Verdict Materially at Variance with the Issue — as where the Issue is whether the defendant owns Blackacre and the Jury by its Verdict finds that the defendant owns Greenacre — Judgment will be Arrested for the insuffi ciency of the Verdict The Court cannot tell from such a Verdict for which Party the Judgment should be given. And, in general, it is a universal Rule in Arresting Judgment, that any Defect in the Record which would render erroneous a Judgment entered in pur suance of a Verdict, constitutes a valid groun d for Arresting the Judgment. “For,” 34. 27 EIiz. c. 5, 6 Statutes at Large 360 (1585). 35. 4 Anne, e. 16, 11 Statutes at Large 155 (1705)."},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"Page 599 of 735 36.

In the other case, that he is not enti tled to the Judgment of the Court, although a Verdict has been delivered in his favor. Like the Motion for Judgment Non Obstante Vercd - icio, that in Arrest of Judgment must always be grounded upon something Appar ent on the Face of the Pleadings; for instance, if, in an Action against the indorser of a Bill of Exchange, the plaintiff were to omit to allege in his Declaration that the defendant had notice of dishonor, Judgment would be Arrested even after a Verdict in the plain tiff’s favor. “The power to make these respective Mo tions, coupled with the inability to Demur and Plead at the Same Time, led to a prac tice of passing over Objections to the Plead ings until After the Trial, when it was too late to Amend, and the successful litigant was often deprived of the fruits of a Verdict ac cording to the merits by a slip in the Plead ings, whi ch might have been remedied if brought to his notice by Demurrer.” ~‘ An utter failure to keep in view the proper Functions of Pleading is strikingly shown when a Fair Trial on the merits of a case is set at naught by a Motion in Arrest of Judg ment, by J udgment Notwithstanding the Ver dict, or even on Writ of Error, because of a lack of some Allegation in the Declaration. And some have regarded such an outcome a perversion of Justice by the Rules of Proce dure, resulting from the blind and mechanical appl ication of Rules for their own sake. Of course, all too often, astute practitioners, in stead of giving gratuitous instructions to their opponents, permit them to go through the Trial on Defective Pleadings, and then wipe out all the results of the Trial i f it goes against them, by Motion in Arrest of Judgment, or a Similar Motion. 41.

In referring to this type of practice, in the Illinois case of Oilman v. Chicago Railway Co.,42 Craig, J., in dissenting, declared: “The defendant, if not sufficiently informed of the Statement of Claim, had the right to demand a more Specific Statement, but instead of that it filed an Affidavit of Merits, in which it reserved the right to object to any insuffi ciency of plaintiff’s claim, went to Trial, and had a Fair Trial on the Merits, and, having been unsuccessful in the Trial, now asks that the Judgment be Reversed because the Statement of C laim did not set out a Com plete Cause of Action.” ~ The majority of the Court failed to appreciate that the main Function of Pleading is to clear the ground preparatory to the Trial. The need of a formal “basis for the Judgment” is not a sufficient reason for permitting such Objec tions to Pleadings to be raised and be availed of after a Trial on the Merits, unless it is shown that the defendant was actually pre vented from having a Fair Trial by reason of the Defect. In some States, a defendant, when a D emur rer has been erroneously overruled, may not Move in Arrest of Judgment; yet he may Move for Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto, or he may secure a Reversal of the Judgment on Writ of Errorfr~ But it has been well said that “a Court, by Ruling Wrongly on a Demurrer, does not preclude itself from aft erwards Ruling Rightly upon a Motion in Arrest of Judgment.” ~ C. 205 El. 305, 311, 109 N.E. 181, 183 (1915). 43 - See, also, Enberg it.

Sec. 307 Defects in the Verdict FROM the logical nature of the Rules gov erning all Common - Law Pleading, it is ap parent that, if a Verdict is to be effective as a finding upon the Issues presented, it must conform to and include all matters of Sub stance covered by such Issues. Judgment will consequently be Arrested when a Gen eral Verdict, awarding Entire Damages, is given on a Declaration containing Several Counts, some of which are bad, but not when it is silent as to matters which, though submitted, can have no effect upon the merits of the con troversy. 46 Relation of Motio n in Arrest of Judgment and Aider by Verdict AS we have seen,’ 7 it is well settled that Faults in Pleading may in some cases be Aided or Cured by Verdict. Thus, where the plaintiff, in alleging a grant which must have been by deed, fails to expressly State in the Declaration that it was by deed, and the de fendant, ins tead of Demurring, as he would be entitled to do, and in case of which the Declaration would be held bad, Pleads Over, and Issue is taken upon the grant, and a Ver dict rendered for the plaintiff, the Verdict Cures the Defect in the Declaration, and no obj ection can be taken on that ground by motion in Arrest of Judgment, or by Writ of Error.’~ The doctrine of Aider by Verdict is 46.

Forman, 26 founded on the Common Law, and is entirely independent of any S tatutory Enactment. The expressions “Cured” or “Aided by Ver dict” signify that the Court will, after Ver dict, presume or intend that the particular thing which appears to be Defectively or Imperfectly Stated, or Omitted, was duly proved at the Trial so a s to support the Ver - dict. But, if the Declaration fails to allege any Substantive Fact which is essential to the Statement of a Cause of Action, and which is not implied in, or inferrable from the finding on those which are alleged, a Ver dict for the pla intiff does not Cure the De fect. Thus, for example, if in Ejectment the plaintiff Omits the Allegation of Ouster, and the Jury nevertheless finds a Verdict for the plaintiff, the Judgment must be Arrested.

The Intendment must arise not from the Verdict alone, but from the combined effect of the Verdict, and the Issue upon which the Verdict was given, as shown by the Record.

A more simple statement of the Rule is that a Verdict will Cure the Defective Statement of a Title, but Not the Statem ent of a Defective Title.

It should be observed that in such a case the Judgment is in reality grounded upon the Confession made in the Plea, with out re gard to the Verdict, as the Verdict decides nothing however it may go,M Formerly, the Motion for Judgment Non Qbstctnte Veredicto, was granted only where it Appeared upon the Record that the plain tiff was entitled to Judgment Notwithstand ing the Verdict for the defendant; and the defendant wa,s limited to a Motion in Arrest of Judgment, and could not obtain a Judg ment after a Verdict for the plaintiff upon a Bad Declaration. 55 But, under Modern Law, the Motion was also held available by some Amer ican Courts in favor of a defendant, where the plaintiff’s Pleadings were not suf ficient to support a Judgment in his favor.M It has been urged that this difference is unsubstantial, since a Judgment for the de fendant without regard to the Verdict is in fact an Arrest of Judgment. 57 But accord ing to lCeigwin,~ 4 the difference is not alto gether unsubstantial, as an Arrest of Judg ment is by no means equivalent to the Entry of Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto.

V. 578 LITIGATING THE CONTROVERSY Ch. 27 serves that upon an Arrest of Judgment, no Entry of Judgment is made for Either Party, except where the plaintiff desires a Judgment to be Entered for the defendant to serve as the basis of an Appeal, thus enabling him to have a Final Adjudication of the alleged Cause of Action. In the absence of such an Entry, the action stops at the Arrest of Judg ment, wi th the rights of Neither Party prej udiced, and with the plaintiff free to renew the litigation in some other form and at some other time when success is more apt to at tend his efforts. By contrast, a Judgment Non Qbstanto Veredjcto is as conclusive as is any other Judgment. 5 ° And there is also a distinction between a Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto and a Re - pleader; the first being given when a Plea is Good in Form, but Bad in showing a De fense without merit upon which Issue is Joined and found for the Party Pleading; while the latter is Awarded when the Defect lies rather in the Manner of Statement than the Matter Pleaded, upon which aa’i Immate rial Issue is Joined. A Judgment Non Ob stante Veredicto is always upon the Merits of the Action; a Repleader is upon the Form and Manner of Pleading. 6 ° If a Plea is De fective, and the defendant succeeds at the Trial, the question is whether the Plea Con fesses the Cause of Action. If it does, and the Matter Pleaded in Avoidance is insuffi cient, the plaintiff w ill be entitled to Judg ment Notwithstanding the Verdict. If not, there should be a Repleader. 5$. Birmingham it.

When the Court, from the Whole Rec ord, is unable to determine for whom the Judg ment should be gi’~en, by reason of the Issue as developed by the Pleadings having been an Immaterial One, it may order the Parties to Plead De Novo. WHEN the Parties to an Action have Joined Issue and the Jury has rendered a Verdict upon a point which in its nature is not calculated to determine the contro versy on its merits, the Court, not having the proper material upon which to render a Final Judgment in Bar for One Party or the Other, will direct the Parties to Replead the case from the point where there was a De parture from correct Allegation. 6 ’ Such a direct ion is only ordered after Verdict, for the obvious reason that until then the ques tion for whom the Judgment should be ren dered cannot well arise. Beginning with the first Defective Allegation, without regard to the side on which it appears, the New Plea d ing continues until each Faulty Pleading is replaced with a correct one, and there is a Joinder on a Material Issue, Which will make it possible to determine the case on the merits. The usual case for Awarding a Repleader occurs when the defendant, Not Confessing the Plaintiff’s Cause of Action, sets forth some Fact which is immaterial and hence not calculated to decide the controversy on the merits, whereupon the plaintiff inad vertently traverses the Immaterial Allega tion, upon which a Verdict is rend ered. The Fact found by the Verdict, not being adapted to determine the litigation, and the Court, not able to render a Judgment on the merits, should order a Repleader for the purpose of producing a Material Issue. Thus, for example, where A brought Assumpsit against 61. For a discussion of Repleader, see McRelvey, Com mon - Law Pleading, e. VII, Motions Based on the Pleadings, III, Repleader, 179 — 182 (Now York 1914). See, also, Ex ~arte Pearce, 80 Ala. 195 (1885). an Administrator, and alleged a Promise by the decedent to pay money, and B, the de fendant, Denied that he so Promised, the Flea neither Admits nor Denies the Promise of the decedent. The fact that B set up, to wit, that he had made No Promise, wheth er t rue or untrue, was irrelevant, and not responsive to A’s Allegation that the de cedent had promised to pay the money. To this Plea, the plaintiff should Demur, but if he should mistakenly Traverse it, the Is - sue created would be an immaterial one, and a Ve rdict would not, therefore, be decisive as to the merits of the case. Accordingly, the Court should Award a Repleader to es tablish an Issue of Fact upon which a Judg ment on the merits might be rendered for one Party or the other.° 2 The famous case of St aple v. Heydon 63 af fords another example of a situation which called for a Repleader. A brought Trespass against B, alleging that .8 had wrongfully entered upon a certain wharf in the Thames river. This wharf was held by A under a lease from C and adjoin ed a lot on the bank which was held by B under a lease from the same C. B Pleaded that he had a right of way over the wharf, derived from C; but the Plea was Defective in Form because in tracing title it showed that C himself was a lessee, and it did not s how from what seisin in fee his term was derived. For this reason his Plea was held Demurrable in Form al though it was Valid in Substance. In order to bolster his Defence, B in his Plea further alleged that he had no other way of egress from his lot to th e river than by crossing the wharf, which Plea of a right of way by necessity was not supported by the Facts stated in relation to his title. To this part of the Plea A Replied that B had “another convenienter way to the river.” The Issue thus taken upon t he Replication of A was 62. Fairfax it. Lewis, 2 Rand.

Raym. 921, 92 Eng.Uep. 115 (1703). 579 clearly Immaterial, and upon a Verdict for the defendant at the Trial, the Court held that the case was one in which a Repleade r was proper. So, where, as in the instant case, a defendant interposes a Defense which in itself is valid, but then adds an Allega tion of an Immaterial Fact, and the plain tiff mistakenly takes Issue upon that Fact, after which a Verdict is rendered, no Mate rial Issue arises upon which the Court can determine the case upon its merits, and the Verdict, whether for One Party or the Other, fails to guide the Court as to who is entitled to Judgment. In the example above, the Plea does not Confess the plaintiff’s Cause of Action by admitting his title, but Denies his right, although placing the Defense upon an un tenable ground. As the defendant has not admitted a prima facie"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"Page 607 of 735 right in the plaintiff, wh ich he has not sufficiently avoided, but on the contrary has disputed the plaintiff’s right, but for reasons which are invalid, the plain tiff is not in a position to demand a Judg ment Notwithstanding the Verdict. The Ver dict upon the Issue as to whether the defend ant had a convenient egress from his lot to the river other than by crossing the wharf, was not determinative of the Issue as to whether the defendant had trespassed upon the plaintiff’s wharf. It follows, therefore, that the distinction betwee n a case for Judg ment Non Obstante Veredicto and one for Repleader turns on whether or not the de fendant has by his Plea Confessed the plain tiff’s Cause of Action.” As Iceigwin ob serves: “If the Plea admits the Tort or the Breach of Contract alleged an d undertalces to Justify or Discharge it by matter not sufficient for that purpose, a Verdict for the defendant merely proves the insufficient Avoidance and leaves the Admission still ef fective.

In general, it may be said that the Retrospective Motions, as they existed at Com mon Law, were adopted in the Early Period of American Procedural Development. Sub sequently, due to the lack of a Centralized Court System, under which th e Trial Judges sat En Eanc, as in England, certain Modifica tions in the Procedures Regulating these Mo tions were made. But in substance these Pro cedures followed and still follow the Pattern developed by the Common Law Practice. Motions for New Trials WITH certain Modifications it may be said that the English Common - Law Practice as to Granting New Trials was adopted by the American Courts, being used to Review Errors that occurred at the Trial and which were not Apparent on the Face of the Com mon - Law R ecord. And the Grounds for Granting New Trials, as developed in Eng - land, have become the recognized Grounds for New Trials in both Common - Law and Code Jurisdictions. 68 The Four"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"Page 608 of 735 Day Period after the Entry of the Verdict, during which, at Common Law, the Mo tion is normally made, has ranged from Two Days in the State of Washington 67 to Sixty Days in Wis consin.M Rule 59(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the Motion may be made as late as Ten Days after Judg ment. 6~. lCcigwin, Cases in Common Law Pleading, e. xvi II, Retro~pcctive Motions, 775 (24 ed., Itocliester 1934). 60.

According to MilIar, 69 our Courts have followed the Common - Law Practice in allow ing more time where the Motion for New Trial is based upon Newly Discovered Evi dence. A Motion on this Ground may be made within a reasonable time, Not More than One Year from the Date of Judgment, under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Ituics of Civil Pro cedure, The Motion for New Trial, as at Common Law, is still addressed to the Court’s discre tion. 7 ° While there is a distinction bets%’een a Motion Raising a Question of Law, and one in correctly characterized as an “Error in Fact,” as, for example, where it is asserted that the Verdict is against the weight of evidence, it seems clear that in most Juri sdictions Errors of Law not productive of manifest injustice will not warrant the granting of a New Trial. Unfortunately, some American Courts have followed the 1835 English Court of Ex chequer Rule, under which, in the matter of evidence, “an Error of Rul ing created per se for the excepting and defeated party a right to a New Trial.” ~‘ The Common - Law Rule, un der which a New Trial was not in order, even though mistakes may have occurred, if it appeared upon the whole that substantial Justice had been done , now seems the proper solution. Within forty years after it was adopted, the “Exchequer Rule” was abolished in England under the Judicature Acts, with the Rules of 1875, which provided that a New Trial on the ground of an improper Instruc tion by the Cour t or an improper Admission or Rejection of Evidence, was not to be grant ed unless “some substantial wrong or mis - 69. 31111cr, Civil Procedure of the Tria’ Court In Historical Perspective, c.

This change in the Common - Law Practice resulted from a decentralization of the Trial Courts, and the development of Review of Erroi’s by separate Appellate Courts. At Common Law a Verdict was indivisible, hence a New Trial involved a Retrial of All Issues, and this was true although the Mo tivating Error was not applicable to All Is sues, and the Same Parties were also involved in the New Trial. One of the earliest rec ognitions of the Doctrine of Severability of Issues and Parties came in Massachusetts in 1831 in the case of Winat v. Columbian Insur ance Co., 73 and since then has come to prevail in Other States. Related to this problem is that of whether a Court may condition its refusal of a New Trial on the plaintiff’s remission of an appro priate amount for that of the Verdict. In Wood v. Gunstone ~ decided in 1655, a New Trial was granted because the Damages were Excessive, and this practice has continued. 3 Nor does the Court’s Action in this respect violate the Constitutional R ight to Trial by Jury)° A more difficult question arose when the Amount of Damages given in the Verdict appeared Inadequate, and there has been some doubt expressed as to the Constitution - ality of Statutes in Some States prohibiting 72.

Lyman, 76 in which he took the position that a Party had a right to have a Prejudicial Error in a Tria] corrected, but not a right to a New Trial if the error could be otherwise corrected, and that in making such correction it was necessary to destroy only what was erroneous when the latter could be severed from the former. This Rul ing was followed in Other States, N ew Jersey making it the subject of a Provision of the New Jersey Practice Act of 1912.~° And in Dimick v. Schiedt, 8 ° the problem dealt with the Issue in a negative manner, the Supreme Court holding that, regardless of Earlier Rulings, the Common Law at the time of the adoption of the Constitution “forbade the Courts to increase the Amount of Damages awarded by a Jury in Actions such as that here under consideration,” — that the practice of Increasing Damages, where the Damages given by the V erdict were Inadequate, was no part of recognized practice — and hence was to be regarded as in violation of the Sev enth Amendment.

This latter Motion, which is in effect a Motion for Judgment on the Plead ings, is not restricted to a Motion After Ver d ict, and it had the combined effect of a Demurrer and the relevant Common - Law Motions. In New York the recognition of the Judicial Equivalent of the Common - Law Mo - dons was given Statutory Effect in 1908 when the Legislature provided that where either Party was entitled to Judgment on the Plead ings, the Court might give Judgment at any time after Issue Joined, 86 and this provision was carried forward in the Civil Practice Act 82.

In the Common - Law Motions, the result of the Motion turns upon the Pleadings exclusively, without any regard to the evidence.

A Judgment is the Award of Relief pronounced by a Court, upon the Facts Found. AT Common Law, on the expiration of the Rule for Judgment, if there were no previous Motion for a New Trial, or in Arrest of Judg ment, and if the prevailing Party had had the Postea stamped and marked by the Clerk of the Postea, he might proceed to sign Final Judgment. According to Blackstone, in Ancient Times a Judgment was represented as the determi nation and Sentence of the Law and not the determination or sentence of the Judge pro nouncing it,’ The theory was that it would better command the obedience of the suitors and the support of the community if it was regarded as the Act of the Law, binding on all, as opposed to being treated as the Act of the Judges, who were not infallible. This dis tinction found expression in the Style and Form of the Judgment, which were said to be 2 - 3 Blackstone, Commentaries o,i the Laws of Eng laud, 396 (6th ed., Du blin, 1775). “the Sentence of the Law, pronounced by the Court upon the Matter Contained in the Rec ord.” 2 Thus, the Ancient Judgment made no mention of the Judges, 3 but read: “It is con sidered by the Court” (consideToturn est per curiani) that the plaintiff do recover his Damages, his Debt, his Possession, and the like; which implies that the Judgment is none of their own, but the Act of Law, pro nounced and declared by the Court. 4 THE JUDGMENT THE OBJECT OF AN ACTION 312.

The Final Judgment is the Conclusion of Law officially declared and pronounced by the Court upon the Facts Found, after due deliberation and inquiry, declaring that the plaintiff has either shown himself entitled, or has not, to recover the re dress he sues for. In Jurisdictions which have abolished the distinctions between Law and Equity as far as Proced ure is concerned, the final determinations of any Action or Suit is called a Judgment. 5 The natural right to relief for Breaches of Contracts would seem to be performance in Kind, to be enforced by an Order of the Court directing the defendant to perform under threat of punishment by imprisonment or fine. So, in the case of Tort, it would seem that the plaintiff should have a right to spe cific reparation, by a decree compelling the Tort - Feasor to restore the state of things that would have existed but for his wrong. Likewise, in the case of a claim"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"Page 613 of 735 to property, the natural relief would seem to be a decree requiring the detainer to deliver possession of the property and make restitution of the very thing itself. As a General Rule, however, Money Dam ages a re the panacea of the Common Law; Specific Relief is regarded as exceptional and extraordinary, and generally attainable only in Equity, except in the case of recovery of Debts and of Possession of Real and Personal Property. 5 - See Walker y. Walker, 93 I owa 643, 61 N.W. 930 (1895). TEE JUDGMENT AT LAW AND DECREE IN EQUITY COMPARED AND DISTINGUISHED 313. A Judgment at Law merely determines the Matter of Right between the Parties, where as a Decree in Equity not only determines the Matter of Eight between the Parties, but or ders the defendant to obey the Decree on Peril of Contempt for failure so to do. THE Judgment of a Common - Law Court did not order the wrongdoers to do anything; it did no t directly seek to compel them to re pair their wrongs. It merely determined the Matter of Right between the Parties. Thus, the Judgment was simply that the plaintiff do recover the Damages, Debt or Possession, as the case may be. If the moral persuasion o f the Judgment was not sufficient to move the wrongdoer, then the Law intervened in aid of the Judgment. It sought by the exer tion of physical force through the Sheriff and the seizure of the defendant’s property on Execution to give the plaintiff the Red ress Awarded, The Sheriff was invested with le gal authority, under Writs of Execution, to seize, sell and transfer Title to the defendant’s property subject to debts, and by such seizure and sale to pay the Money Judgment out of the proceeds. But in no ea se was it adjudged at Common Law that the defendant be com pelled to act or aid the plaintiff or Sheriff to do Justice or Satisfy the Judgment. All that the defendant was required to do was to sub mit to the authorized acts of the Sheriff. The defendant co uld not be called before the Court and punished for a contempt because he did not actively exert himself in surrendering his property or disclosing its whereabouts to the Sheriff, so that he might carry out and Satis fy the Judgment. As Professor Langdell xr marked: “The defendant may know where the property is, having purposely removed it or concealed it from the Sheriff; still he can - not be ordered to deliver it to the plaintiff.. So, if a defendant has refused to Perform a Contract, a Court of Common Law can only give the plaintiff Damages, no matter how 586 JUDGMENT, EXECUTION AND APPELLATE REVIEW Ch. 28 important to the latter actual performance may be.” 0 Neither did the Common - Law Courts successfully accomplish a division or partition of real estate a mong the several co owners, nor compel the rendering of an ac count, though this was formerly attempted. A Decree in Equity, as contrasted to a Judgment at Common Law, not only deter mined the Matter of Right between the par ties; it ordered the defendant to do some thing about it, on peril of being jailed for Contempt if he failed so to do. This was done n the theory that in refusing obedience to the Decree, the defendant was guilty of a Contempt, not to the Chancellor, but to the King, and hence when he proceeded to punish him for Contempt, he used a Procedure un known to the Common Law, the defendant being treated as if he were a rebel and con temner of the King’s Sovereignty - 7 THE CLASSIFICATION AND SCOPE OF’ JUDGMENTS 314. Judgments are either Interlocutory or Final. The former is one which defines the rights of the parties at an intermediate stage of the action, whereas the latter is one which ends the particular Action. The Scope of a Judgment is determined by its Form and ob ject. interlocut ory Judgments INTERLOCUTORY Judgments define the rights of the parties at an intermediate stage of the action, but they do not"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"Page 614 of 735 Terminate the Suit. Probably the best instances of Interloc utory Judgments are those entered by Default in Actions of Assumpsit , Case, Covenant and Trespass, where the Sole Object of the Action is the Recovery of Damages, by which at Common Law only the Right to recover is de termined, leaving the Amount to be ascertain ed by a Writ of Inquiry or other proceedings 6.

Id. at 1 38, p. 30. upon which a Final Judgment will be ren dered. There is one species of Interlocutory Judgment, however, which establishes only the Inadequacy of the Defense interposed. A Judgment for the plaintiff on a Demurrer to a Plea in Abatement is such a Judgment as it is a decision on a point independent of the Merits of the Case, and in Form is always that the defendant Answer Over. There are many Judgments, Interlocutory in character, which define the rights of the parties at an Inter mediate Stage of the Action. 8 Judgments before Issue Joined are of v a rious Kinds, including those referred to above, and are in their nature Interlocutory, though often not classed as such. They are generally the result of the fault or neglect of one of the Parties in failing to pursue the means available, and may be for either Par ty, If for the plaintiff, Judgment may be for Default of Appearance of the defendant, aft er being served with Process; or, in All Ac tions,! of Nit Dicit, where, having Appeared, he neither Demurs nor Pleads, nor maintains his Pleadings until the Issue is complete. Again, if the defendant’s Attorney Enters on Record a statement that he is not informed of any answer to be given, or if the defend ant, having n o Defense, chooses to Confess the Action, Judgment for the plaintiff will be respectively Non Sum Infarnwtus, or by Con fession. If for the defendant, Judgments of Non Prose quitur, Retraxit, (Jassetur Breve, Nofle Prose qui, may be Entered against the pla intiff, according as he fails to maintain his Suit, or Prays that his own Writ be Quashed, or Discontinues the Action. 9 Thus, Interlocutory Judgments at Com mon Law may be Judgments which are fol lowed by Final Judgments, such as a Default 8. See Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, c. XIV, Trial, Verdict. Judgment and Execution, Art.

Sec. 315 THE JUDGMENT 587 Judgment which is followed by an Inquiry to assess Damages and then a Final Judgment; or, Interlocutory Judgments at Common Law may be such as settle an Issue in the course of the Action, but only to clear the way for another Issue to be raised in the same case, such as where the Judgment on an Jssue of Law on a Dilatory Plea is in favor of the plaintiff, in which case the Judgment is, Let the Defendant Answer Over to the Action, called a Judgment Respondeat Ouster.’° Final Judgments FINAL Judgments are instanced by the Judgments rendered where an Issue of Fact has been tried by a Jury, who also Assess the Damages. Also, at Common Law, a Judg ment f or plaintiff on a Demurrer to a Plead ing - in - Chief, where the damages are liquidat ed, and a Judgment for defendant on a De murrer to a Pleading - in - Chief, are Final Judg ments. In these cases, there is nothing left to be done, and the Judgment, therefore, neces sarily ends that Particular Action, as distin guished from an Interlocutory Judgm ent, which leaves something remaining to be done and does not Terminate the Action. Thus, a Judgment for plaintiff at Common Law on a Demurrer to a Pleading - in - Chief where the damages are unliquidated, may initially be classified as Interlocutory, but it i s followed, after assessment of damages, by a Final Judgment.” Final Judgments may be in dif ferent forms. If, for example, there is a Judg ment for defendant on a Dilatory Plea, either on an Issue of Fact or Law, the Judgment is generally that the Writ be quashed, or the Ac tion Dismissed. Though such a Judgment is not conclusive on the Merits of the Case, it 10. Stephen, A Treatise on the Principles of Pleading in Civil Actions, c.

IT, Demurrer, § 241, Judgments on Demurrer, 201, 202 (St. Paul, 1905). nevertheless disposes of the particular Suit, and has been classified as a Final Judgment.’ 2 Under Modern Practice and Statutes, a rul ing on a Demurrer to a Pleading - in - Chief us ually does not result in a Final Judgment, as where a Demurrer to a Pleading - in - Chief is sustained, the Party whose Pleading is found defective is generally permitted to Amend his Pleading; and where a Demurrer to a Pleath ing - in - Chief is overruled, the Party ~‘.‘ho inter posed the Demurrer is generally permitted to Plead Over. REVIVAL OF JUDGMENTS 315. If no execution was had upon a judg ment in a real action for a year, it was neces sary to obtain a Scire Facias in order to ex ecute. The same procedure was made avail able, by Statute, in cases where a Judgment had been obtaine d in a personal action. A Scire Facias was also necessary where a new person was to receive the benefit of or to be charged by the execution. WHEN, in a real action, Judgment was ob tained at Common Law for a particular par cel of land, it was required that any execu tion thereunder be entered on the Roll. If no such entry appeared on the Roll for a year, execution could thereafter be had only by re sort to a Writ of Scire Facias, which issued to show cause why execution shou ld not be awarded under the Judgment. 13 The reason the plaintiff was required to resort to Scire Facias after the lapse of a year was because it was presumed, in view of his long delay in executing upon the Judgment, that the execution was released. The d efend ant would not be disturbed in his possession without having the opportunity to plead re lease in Court, or showing cause why the ex ecution should not be had. 12. ItL Ut 319. 320. 13.

XLII, Of Seire Faeias, 1000 (1st Am. ed., Philadelphia, 1807). 588 JUDGMENT, EXECUTION AND APPELLATE REVIEW Ch. 28 However, with respect to personal actions, the Common Law rule was otherwise. Where a plaintiff had taken no process of execution fo r a year, he could not then resort to Sci?e Facias, but was required to commence an ac tion upon the Judgment, and the defendant ‘was obliged to show how the debt, which was evidenced by the Judgment, had been dis charged, 14 This situation with respect to Judgments which had been obtained in personal actions ‘was changed by Statute in 1285,’~ and the plaintiff in a personal action was given re course to a Sciire Facias to revive his Judg ment, thereby conforming the procedure available to him with that whi ch prevailed ~vith respect to judgments in real actions. However, due to the wording of the Statute some question arose as to whether this was true in the case of a Judgment obtained in an action of Ejectment, which was considered a personal action, or whe ther the Statute had failed to give the right to one holding a Judg ment in Ejectment. In practice, however, the remedy was granted in such cases, which in fact appeared proper under a reasonable in terpretation of the statutory language. A Scire Facias was also necessary in cases where a new person was to receive the bene fit of or to be charged by the execution, be cause of the rule that executions must corre spond with the Judgments upon which is - sued.~ 24. lii. at 1000, 1001. 25. 13 Ediw. 1, Stat, I c 45, 1 Statutes at Lnrge 224 ‘(1955)."},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"Page 616 of 735 *6 Martin, Civil Procedure at Common Law, c.

The Codes often define the Judgment so as to include both the Common Law Judg ment and the Decree in Equity. Nevertheless, a Judgment on a claim essentially legal in nature retains the attributes of the Common Law Judgment, white a Judgment on a claim essentially equitable in nature retains the at tributes of a Decree in Equity. Under the Codes a Judgment is generally defined as the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or a pro ceeding. 17 And where the Codes have pur ported to abolish the distinction between ac tions at law and suits in equity, the final de termination of the controversy, be it at law or equity, is termed a Judgment. 1 ° Thus, the decree in equity has, from the standpoint of nomenclature, been replaced by the Jud g ment. To consider this change as being of sub stantive import, however, would obviously be in error. At Common Law, as indicated in the above discussion, the Judgment at Law was limited to a determination of the matter of right between the parties, whil e the De cree in Equity not only determined the Mat ter of Right between the parties, but also or dered the defendant to do something about it, on peril of being jailed for contempt if he failed to do so. 1 ° The fact that under the Codes the term Judgment n ow is generally used to embrace both situations does not change the fact that a Judgment on a claim essentially legal in nature will still have the attributes of the Common Law Judgment, while a Judgment on a claim essentially equi table in nature will ret ain the attributes of a Decree in Equity. 17.

The Definition and Nature of Execution AFTER Final Judgment, which in theory is the end of an Action, the plaintiff may, at any time withln a year, sue out a Writ of Execution against the body, lands, or goods of the defendant, provided there be no Writ of Error pending, or agreement to the con trary. 2 An Execution may be defined as a Judicial Writ grounded on the Judgment of the Court from which it issues, 3 and is supposed to be Issued by the Court at the request of the party entitled thereto, to give him Satisfac tion on the Judgment standing in his favor. 4 The mere Judicial Declaration of the right to redress, the award of relief, can pro duce no practical benefit or result, unless the defendant, under its moral persuasion, vol untarily submits to its determinati on of the Matter of Right between the parties, and sat isfies the plaintiff’s demand, If such volun tary action is not forthcoming, then the plaintiff must resort to some Form of Execu tion, the compulsory process for satisfying the plaintiff’s demand and putting the relief awarded by Judgment into Legal Effect by the exercise of Executive Force. Execution, therefore, is in the nature of an Executive Remedy, supplementary to the Judicial Remedy, and may consist: (1) In placing the plaintiff in possession of his land or property by force, the actual res titution of the thing taken or detained; t.

At Common Law, the Execution following the Judgment, is either for the plaintiff or the defendant. If for the plaintiff, the Exc cution upon a Judgment in Assumpsit, Case, Covenant, Replevin or Trespass, was for the damages and costs; in Debt, for the debt damages and costs recovered; in Detinue, the Execution is for the goods or their value, with damages and costs. If for the defend ant, upon a Judgment in Replevin at Common Law, the Execution is for a return of the goods. And, in the other Actions, upon a Judgment of Non - pros, Non - suit or Verdict, it is for the costs only. 5 An Execution must be sued out of the Court which issued the Judgment. And while supposedly awarded by the Judge or Judges in Court, in reality and in practice no such award is in gener al actuaily made. The party who secured the Judgment, and who has a Right to a Writ of Execution, usually sued it out of the proper office in the Form adopted under the Law to the Form of Ac tion and Nature of the Judgment to be car ried into effect. Accor ding to Martin, 6 Exe cutions fall properly into two general classes, each class turning upon the nature of the 5. 2 Tidd, The Practice of the Court of King’s Bench in Personal Actions, c.

These two types of Execution will now be considered, with at tention being directed first to executions where the judgment awards possession of property, and second, where the judgment is for the recovery of money only, as a debt or damages. Restitution of Possession IN the case of a Judgment awarding pos session of land, a Writ of Possession to the Sheriff, commanding him to give actual pos session to the plaintiff of the land so recov ered, is an efficient means to put the sentence of the Law into Force. To accomplish the delivery, the Sheriff may take wi th him the Posse Coni~tatus, or power of the county, calling to his assistance private citizens, and may justify breaking open doors, if the pos session be not quietly delivered. But in the Action of Detinue for recovery of personal chattels, if the wrongd oer were very per verse, he could not be compelled to make res titution of the identical thing taken or re tained; but he had his election to deliver the goods or their value, an imperfection in the Law, which resulted from the Nature of the Judgment and t he methods of Execution em ployed. 7 Execution Against Goods ci Profits of Land THE only Judgments given by the Com mon - Law Courts were those for the delivery of possession, or for the recovery of a debt or damages. By the Common Law a man could procure sa tisfaction for his money judgment from the goods and chattels of his debtor, or the present profits of his debtor’s land, by the Writs of then Facias and Levani Facias.

Therefore, when the Writ of Levani F’acias issued, commanding the Sheriff to levy the plaintiff’s debt on the lands an d goods of the defendant, the Sheriff in executing the Writ, levied only on the goods of the debtor, and the rents and profits of the land, but not on the land itself.” The Sheriff was authorized to continue collection of the rents and profits of the land until the satisfaction of the Judg ment had been secured. According to Martin, the Writ of Lerari Facias, was substantially superseded by the Writ of Elegit, which will be considered next ~12 8. 2 Tidd, The Practice of the Court of ICing’s 1~ench in i’ ersonal Actions, c.

By reason of this Writ, the Sheriff seiz ed the goods and chattels of the defendant, empannelled a Jury, who appraised the goods and chattels so seized, and, except for oxen and beasts of the plough, thereafter deliv ered them to the plaintiff at the price placed upon them in part satisfaction of the debt. If the goods and chattels proved insufficient to satisfy the Judgment, then one - half of his freehold lands were also delivered to the plaintiff, to be held until he had satisfied his Judgment or the debt out of the rents and profits thereof, or until the interest of the de - fendant in the land had expired. While hold ing the land for this purpose, the plaintiff was called a Tenant by Elegit.’ 3 This Execution, or seizing of land under an Eleçjit, is of such high nature that after its issuance the body of the defendant could not be taken upon an? Other Writ; but where the Etegit could not be executed by delivery of lands for the reason that the defendant owned none, and where it appeared that any chattels and goods levied upon were not suf ficient t o satisfy the plaintiffs Judgment, the plaintiff might then sue out a Writ of Capias Ad Satisfaciendum. 14 Tue Writ of Extendi Facias, or Extent THE Writ of Extendi F’acias, or Extent, at Common Law, lay, first, for the debts owed to the Crown; second, on a Statute Merchant or Statute - Staple, or Recognizance in the Nature of a Statute - Staple; and third, on a Execution, 383, Executions In Actions for the Recovery of Money, 325 (St. Paul 1005). 13. 3 Blaekstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, c.

As to debts Not of Record, the Re medy for recovery of them was governed by the Statute of 33 Her 4 . VIII, c. 39, 5 Statutes at Large 115 (1541), which provided that all obligations and specialties made for any cause touching the King or his heirs, were to be of the same effect as writ ings obligatory acknowledged according to the Statute of the Staple at Westminster. The Execution of this Writ was directed against the body, lands and goods of the Crown debtor. And the Sheriff was com manded to inquire by a Jury what goods and lands the def endant was seized of, to ap praise and extend them, and to take and seize the same into the King’s hands. In the court of Exchequer, under a prac tice recognized and controlled by Statutes, a debtor of the Crown might invoke in his be half, the Writ of Extendi Facias, for the pur pose of collecting a debt of equal amount due him from any subject, the theory being that without the aid of such Writ the Crown might be unable to collect its claim against its debtor. Such a Writ could also be in voked by a su rety of a debtor to the Crown who had paid the debt of the Crown Debtor. As so used the writ was called a Writ of Extendi Facias in Aid, as opposed to a Writ of Extendi Facias in Chief, where it was em ployed only to collect debts directly due to the Crown . The Writ of Capias Ad Satisfacienduin The ordinary Common - Law Method of en forcing a Judgment where money only is recovered, as damages or a debt and not any specific chattel, is now, as it anciently was, 15. Id. at 043. Sec. 317 THE EXECUTION 59a by seizure and sale of the property of the defendant. Execution against the person was, however, at an early date extended from criminal procedure, so that the body of the debtor was or might be imprisoned until satisfaction was made for the debt, costs or damages. This species of Execution was by a Writ of Capias Ad Satisfaciendum, and was assumed by the Courts to be availaNe wherever the defendant was liable to be taken upon a writ of Capias Ad Res’pondendum, to compel ap - pearance at the beginning of the suit, or as a provisional remedy and security for the Judgment. At first this Writ was available to subject to imprisonment the body of the defendant in Trespass Vi Et .~4rrnis only. 16 It was then extended to the Actions of Debt and Detinue by the Statute of 25 Edw. Ill, c. 17, 2 Statutes at Large 59 (1350), and to the Action on the Case in 1503.” The original exemption from arrest at Common Law was probably due to feudal reasons, rather than to a regard for personal liberty. Where a defendant is at large when the Writ issues, it commands the Sheriff to take body of the defendant, to keep him safely, so that he may have his body in Court on the return - day to satisfy the plaintiff of the debt or damages recovered. When the de fendant was already in custody, there was no occasion for the Writ. The effect of this Writ, taken after Judgment, was to deprive the defendant of his liberty until he made satisfaction of the debt or damages. 18 If he 18. Forsythe v.

Id. at 962 — 969 for a discussion of this Statute. 594 JUDGMENT, EXECUTION AND APPELLATE REVIEW Ch. 29 THE LIEN OF EXECUTIONS 318. A General Lien of an Execution binds property after the Writ has come into the hands of the Sheriff and while the Writ remains un satisfied. Where goods taken in Execution were per mitted to remain in the custody of the debtor, at Common Law such goods might be seized at the suit of another creditor. At Common Law and in England, the Writ of Fieri Facias bound the defendant’s goods from the time of its teste, so that a sale of the goods made thereafter by the defendant, though bona fide, migh t have been avoid ed. 23 This was changed by Section 16 of the Statute of Frauds, 2 - ’ under which the Writ was to bind the property from the time such Writ was delivered to the Sheriff to be executed, who was to endorse on the back thereof when he received t he same. But even so, the property in the goods is not al tered until the Writ is actually executed. If the party dies after the teste, but before the delivery of the Writ to the Sheriff, the goods are bound in the hands of his execu tors or administrator s. As to this situation, the Law is as it was before the Statute, as this involved no change of property by sale and for a valuable consideration. And under the Statute of Frauds, 25 it has been held that a party who bought goods at a sale under an Executi on, which had been de livered to the Sheriff subsequent to the deliv ery of a prior Execution, was protected from the prior Execution, although, as to any oth er party, the goods were bound by the prior 23 - This common - Law Rule prevailed in Tennessee: coffee v.

Dickey, 21 an fllinois Court, in commenting on the priority of Execution, declared: “First, that wh ere two or more Writs of Fieri Facias are delivered at dif ferent times, either to the same or different officers, and no sale is actually made of the defendant’s goods, the Execution first deliv ered must have the priority, though the first seizure may ha ve been made on a subse quent Execution. Second, but where the goods are actually sold by virtue of a"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"Page 622 of 735 levy made under a Junior Execution, the sale will be good, and the property can not afterwards be taken from the purchaser by the Senior Execution. The on ly remedy of the party in jured is against the officer.” 25 Where goods were taken in Execution and suffered to remain in the custody of the debtor, at Common Law, such goods might be seized at the suit of another creditor. 2 ° Finally, a General Lien of an Execution binds property acquired after the Writ has come into the hands of the Sheriff and while the Writ remains unsatisfied. 3 ° STATUS OF EXECUTION UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RULES OF COURT 319.

Certain of the Common Law Writs c ontinue in use, especially that of Fieri Facias, al though they may be designated by other names. AS among the Common Law Writs, Fiert Facias still flourishes, “frequently, it is true, in a code disguise.” 31 The Writ of Elegit was too feeble a Remedy to survive, although it was long used in Virginia. 32 31.

Th e early Common - Law Rule exempting lands from sale on Executions has been abol ished by Statutes, and while under such Stat utes resort must usually first be had to per sonalty, the general rule now is that the Judgment creates a lien on the Real Proper ty.

But in some instances, as in certain cases of summary proceedings be fore an Inferior Court, where the proceedings were not according to the Course of Common Law,” and there was no other method of re view, Certiorari was permitted even after Fi nal Judgment.’ 2 But Errors in rulings which occurred at the Trial could only be reviewed by Motion for New Trial, Bill of Exceptions, or under Modern Procedure, by Appeal.

The Writ was grantable cx debito justitiae {from or as a debt of justice, or as a matter of right] in all cases except Treasons and Felony. 20 The strict Common - Law Record consisted of four parts: (1) The Process, which in cluded the Orig inal Writ and the Return of the Sheriff; (2) The Declaration and All Subsequent Pleadings, including Demurrers, if any; (3) The Verdict, and (4) The Judg ment. After the Judgment has been entered on the Record, by removing this Record to the Appellate Cour t and Assigning Errors up on it, the unsuccessful Party in the Trial Court could secure a Review of any Error of Law Apparent upon the Face of Any Portion of the Common - Law Record, the objective be ing to"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"Page 627 of 735 reverse or modify the Judgment for some Error of La w supposed to exist in the Proceedings as recorded.

Judge was usually a member. This Court could grant or refuse a New Trial as a matter of discretion, the exercise of which was not Reviewable at Common Law. The Writ of Error is usually brought by the Party or Parties against whom the Judg ment was given; but it may be brought by a plaintiff to Reverse his own Judgment, if er roneous, in order to enable him to bring an other action. 21 But the defendant was not permitted to bring it contr ary to his own agreement or that of his Attorney. 22 In general, a Writ of Error was available for any Error or Defect in Substance that had not been Aided, Amended or Cured at Common Law, or by the effect of one or more of the Statutes of Amendments and J eofails. 23 Thus, the Entry of a Judgment in a Form inappropriate to the Specific Form of Action, constituted an Error of Law. And if the plaintiff brings an Action of Ejectment and omits the Allegation of Ouster, alleging only Title and Damages, such omiss ion of a Sub stantive Allegation will be available on Writ of Error after Final Judgment. And in this connection, it should be ob served that there was some doubt as to whether a Judgment on Demurrer could be Reviewed as a part of the Common - Law Rec ord, without taking an Exception. Speaking to this very point in Hamlin v. Reynolds 24 21. Johnson v. Jebb, 3 Burr 1772, 97 Eng.Rep. 1091 (1705). 22. Cates t West, 2 T.R. 183, 100 Eng.Rep. 90 (1787). 23. See Chapter 20, Aider and Amendment 24. 22 Dl. 2 07, 200 (1859). Walker, 3., declared: “It is believed that no reported case can be found, either in Great Britain or this country, in which it has been held that it is necessary to Except to the Judgment on a Demurrer, to enable the Par ty to have the deci sion Reviewed in an Ap pellate Court. By the Ancient Practice it was the Final Judgment in the case, on the Count or Plea to which the Demurrer was in terposed, and Leave to Amend or Plead Over was rarely if ever given. And the Judgment on Demurrer, by the Modern Practice, is Final, unless the Court in the exercise of its discretion permits an Amendment, or grants Leave to Plead Over. The Judgment on the Demurrer is as much a Part of the Record as any other Judgment that is rendered by the Court in the Caus e. The Office of a Bill of Exceptions is to preserve that of Record, which otherwise would not Appear of Record. By the Practice of Courts of Common - Law Jurisdiction, the Evidence in a Cause, the Decisions of the Court in Admitting or Re jecting Evidence, Affidavits on Motions, and the Reasons Upon which Motions are Made, the Giving and Refusing Instructions, and Various Other Matters, do not Appear of Rec ord, and are no part of it, unless embodied in a Bill of Exceptions, and by that means are made a part of the Record in the case. In the - decision of all such questions, the Judgment of the Court is not usually spread upon the Roll of its Proceedings. While Judgments by Default, on Demurrer, in cases of Nonsuit, Fi nal Judgment on Verdict, etc., have by the practice at all periods, been so Entered and re garded as a Part of the Record. It would be improper practice, to embody a Judgment on a Demurrer in a Bill of Exceptions, as it would uselessly incumber the Record and unneces sarily add to the expense of l itigation. The position that the Judgment on the Demurrer to the Second and Third Pleas in this case, was not Excepted to in the Court Below is - wholly untenable,” Sec. 323 APPELLATE REVIEW 601 The Writ of Error: Coram Nobis"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"Page 628 of 735 WHERE a Judgment was Erroneous in Point of Fact only, and Not in Point of Law, it could be reversed by the same Court, by Writ of Error Coram Nobis, or Quac Corant Nobis Resident, so called from its being found ed on the Record and Process, which were - stated in the Writ to remain in the Court of the Lord the King, before the King himself; as where the defendant, being under age, ap peared by Attorney, or the plaintiff or de fendant was a married woman, at the Com mencement of the Suit, or died before V er dict, or Interlocutory Judgment; for Error in Fact was not the Error of the Judges, hence reversing it was not reversing their own Judgment.

This Court could grant or refuse to grant a New Trial in its discretion, the exercise of which at C ommon Law was not Reviewable. This Method of Review left the Aggrieved Party somewhat at the mercy of the Original Trial Judge, as he was usually a Part of the Reviewing Court En Banc, and it provided No Method for Re view, after Judgment, of Errors which occur red At the Trial. Obviously, a New Method was needed by which such Errors could be incorporated into the Record. The Origin of the Bifl of Exceptions THE Method devised had its origin in that Great Remedial Statute of the Common Law, the Statute of Westminster II, 13 Edw. I, c. 31, 1 Statutes at Large 206 (1285), under which it was provided, in Substance, that where an Error occurred At the Trial, such as the Improper Admission of Evidence, the Aggrieved Party could allege an Exception; if the Except ion was not allowed, he could reduce the Exception to Writing, 26 have it Signed and Sealed by the Judge, and Attach it to the Record. This operation incorpo rated the alleged Errors into the Record and when the Writ of Error issued, not only those Errors A pparent Upon the Face of the Common - Law Record, if any, but also those Errors which occurred At the Trial, and which had now been incorporated by means 26. The time for reducing the exception to writing was not prescribed by the statute, but it was held i n the case of Wright - r. Sharp, 1 Salk. 288, 250, 91 Eng. Rep. 255, 258 (1705), that reason required the sub stance of the exception be reduced to writing when taken and disallowed. 602 JUDGMENT, EXECUTION AND APPELLATE REVIEW Ch. 30 of the force and effect of Chapter 31 of the Statute of Westminster U, also went up to the Appellate Court for Review. And thus the explanation of the distinction between Matters on the Record, and Matters in the Record, or, as sometimes otherwise express ed, between Matter of Record and Matter of Exception, Matter of Record consisting of Errors Apparent Upon the Face of the Strict Common - Law Record; Matter of Exception referring to those Errors placed in the Rec ord by the Bill of Exceptions. STATUS UNDER MODERN CODES, PRACTICE ACTS AND RIfLES"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"Page 629 of 735 OF COURT 324. Review is now generally by Appeal, which is a Statutory Proceeding. Where the Action is Legal in Nature, the Appeal is gen erally limited to a Review of Questions of Law. Where the Action is Equitable in Nature, Ques tions of both Law and Fact are Reviewed on Appeal, as was traditionally the case in Equity. In 1848 the New York Code of Civil Pro cedure made an Appeal the only Form of Review in that State. Other States abolish ed the Writ of Error, but created a System of Review which included a Review of Legal Causes by Proceedings in Error, and for Eq uitable Causes Review on the lines of the Appeal in Chancery. 2~ An Appeal in New York was at that time regarded as a New Ac tio n. 2 ° In those States which did not adopt the New York Statutory Appeal, an Appeal in the Nature of a Writ of Error was adopt ed, including Alabama in 1853, Connecticut in 1882 and 1889, and Pennsylvania in 1889.20 The Method of Appeal in New York, being en tirely Statutory, it was available only in the situations specifically provided for by the 27.

In States where there was a Concur rence of Review by a Writ of Error and an Appeal in the Nature of Error, the term “Ap peal” began to be regarded as covering both Types of Review. This gradual merger of the two principal Modes of Review was a by product flowing from the introduction of Eq uitable Defenses and Equ itable Relief in Ac - tions at Law. - In the States today, Review on Appeal is generally a Statutory Proceeding, with more of the characteristics of the Common - Law Writ of Error, rather than the Appeal in Eq uity, by which the whole cause was removed from a lower to an Appellate Court, and there tried tie novo without reference to the conclusions of the Inferior Court. The Mod ern Appeal is more in the nature of a Writ of Error, in that the Appellate Court does not try the cause afresh or hear evidence. It i s regarded as a continuation of the Original Litigation. In an attempt to modernize and simplify Appellate Review in the Federal Courts, even before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted, Congress, in 1928, abolished the Writ of Error in all c ases, Civil and Criminal, except in cases coming from State Courts, and substituted the Modern Ap peal as the Vehicle for Ordinary Appellate Review. 30 The effect of this Legislation was to make Uniform the Procedure for Review in both Law and Equity, since prior to 1928 the Appeal, and not the Writ of Error, was the Method of Review from a Decree in Eq uity. 3 ’ However, this Legislation did not remove the differences that had theretofore existed 30.

Perhaps the most significant difference was that Appeals from Judgments of Law Courts continued to be limited to Review of Questions of Law only, whereas an Appeal from an Equitable Decree permitted Review of the Facts as well as the Law. 32 Today, the basic Federal Judicial Struc ture is composed of District Courts, 33 Courts of Appeals ~<‘ and the Supr eme Court. 35 The District Courts “are the Trial Courts of the System” and exist in each of the numerous Judicial Districts"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"Page 630 of 735 established by Statute. 36 Decisions of the District Court are Appeal 35.
