INTRODUCTION ...perhaps there is a pattern set up in the heavens for one who desires to see it, and having seen it, to find one in himself - Plato All things that come into being have a reason for their existence, although intellectual lethargy, together with the passage of time, are the reasons why some things are accepted as fact when they are not. We dwell in times were the ego of man, and not the spirit of man, is adored and reinforced. We should allow for all that is said to be sacred to be in an adulterated and atrophied state. Sincere and close observation shows that this is indeed the case with the arcane canon, with the great Hermetic Arts of Divination: Tarot, Astrology, Kabala and Numerology. When I took up a serious study of the Tarot it was there that I found the secrets to the real Archetypal Astrology. The high Arts of Divination have each suffered from flagrant tampering, manipulation and unsustainable interpretation, from those wishing to, as the sun they worship does, conceal greater secrets. Moreover, in today's overly dislocated world of academia, the Divination Arts are almost never taught as one subject as they always were in the past. Nevertheless, as I discovered, it seems that the Universal Will (Intelligence) is always in operation. In my studies I found that what was taken from or lost to one Art would be preserved and traceable in its cousin. That which was expunged or lost to Numerology I found still intact in, say, the Kabala. What was lost to Kabala I could resurrect from the study of Tarot and so on.

I did this with no prerequisite or pet theory, and no partisan conviction or bias. I knew not what shape the final edifice would assume. Little did I realize that my task would take me back through time to see the travesty that time and man have played on all these mystic creations of our forefathers. We may fairly agree that the subject of history, as commonly taught, is one of the most boring of all subjects. However, the study of how the subject of history has been manipulated, is surely one of the most interesting of all subjects - Michael Tsarion Today, due to the pitiful condition of the Earth and the human psyche, the Human Race looks forward to nihilism and calamity. Due to our compulsive fixation on the future, we now prefer to live in ignorance of the sublime bequeathments of the Diviners and Magi of old, and care little to nothing for their many sacrifices and dedication, their observation of the Alchemical nature of nature. Voltaire remarked that man will cease to commit atrocities when he ceases to believe absurdities. Our age, more than any other it seems, has a penchant for exoteric absurdities. In my researches there was always much darkness much that did not make sense. There were leads that initially threw little light but, when added one to another, served to spark my curiosity in ways that no orthodox subject ever had. When studying the Tarot I especially had some questions. Mere aesthetic and artistic knowledge did not serve to explicate the enigmatic symbols and most of what the books had to say often seemed contradictory and perfunctory. So I followed the wisdom of Vernon Howard who wrote: see human nonsense as nonsense and save spending years making sense of it.

But few there are in the west today that have heard of their parent subject - Astro-Theology. We insist that this is not by chance. We as individuals, instead of constantly looking powerlessly forward to hypothetical futures for our truths, must begin revisiting the roots of culture, religion and government. In today's society we are always searching for excellence and perfection. We speak about the prestige of being \"original\" and we admire those who are. But the word original connotes origins, which connotes the ability to - go back to the roots. Many there are, abroad, teaching metaphysical subjects. However, very few teachers dare lay bear the occult roots of religion and politics. It was in the earliest days of my researches, in Ireland, that I came across the voluminous work of Jordan Maxwell, a researcher into the ancient cults. Jordan alone deserves the title \"the world's most controversial speaker.\" Since the 1950s he has been diligently reconstructing the Gnosis of the Stellar and Solar epochs, and has found that these Cults are far from being relics of the past. The puzzles and conundrums that had troubled me for years slowly became lucid, after my introduction to the work of Jordan Maxwell. So was proved to me the truth - If your search is very diligent, then one day you will meet a teacher that will not deceive you. Without the work of Mr. Maxwell I am convinced that I would still be very much in the dark concerning the finer details of the great story, and would certainly never have made the profound discoveries concerning the Divination Arts that has been my good fortune. I come from a tradition were one always honors their patrons and mentors, and I never forget their patronage or influence. My deepest gratitude goes out to Jordan for all his courage, conviction and humanity. If statues of Jordan, in bronze , were to be erected in every city of America, it would still be a small token of homage to this true Magi of our times... per ignem ad lucem!

Where do the images originate and what do they represent? Some have said that the layout tells a certain story. Actually, I believe and advocate, that we cannot hope to come to complete understanding about the Tarot until we experience Life, Being and Cosmos, the way the ancient Egyptians and Mediterranean peoples did. The way they perceived nature, the Universe and the mystery of Being is encapsulated in the Tarot. As Plotinus wrote: The Egyptians, either by exact science or spontaneously, had arrived at a method by means of which they could rite with distinct picture of material objects, instead of ordinary letters expressing sounds and phrases. These pictures were not ordinary images of the things they represented but were endowed with certain symbolic qualities (Sophia), by means of which they revealed to the initiated contemplator a profound insight into the very essence of substances of things, and an intuitive understanding of their transcendental origins, an insight which was not the result of reasoning or mental reflection, but was acquired spontaneously by means of divine inspiration and illumination. As artistic representations of this phenomenal world, they revealed, in fact, the ideal world of the soul. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (5 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The Tarot contains the wealth of their experience about every aspect of life, microcosmically and macrocosmically. The 22 cards of the Major Arcana may be called 22 \"photographs\" of the world of the ancients, if you will. But they are not only of the physical world, but are symbolic representations of the mythic and archetypal dimensions. They allow us to transcend the hylic (base/stereotypic) level and rise to the transluminal (symbolic/archetypal) level of cognition. Tarot cards, like an astrological chart, collectively and individually, represent composite symbolic descriptions of the microcosmic and macrocosmic dimensions. They also depict the dynamics and changes which arise from our interaction with our inner and outer environments. The Divination Arts remind us that our inner world is not separate from the so-called \"outer\" world. They remind us that psychic energy and physical energy are the same thing, seen from two different vantage points. They remind us that ego and self are not the same thing, that doing and being are not the same thing, and that life and lifestyle are not the same thing. Man changes his environment which, in turn, changes him. Man is a part of, and apart from, the world. The glass of water which we drink is forever changed by that act. But we too are changed forever by that same simple act. The ego sees the action of mind over matter as the magic. That is the so-called fact which inspires science. However, the truth is that the real magic is how the mind is affected by matter, by nature, and by the magical and mysterious process we call \"life.\" True symbolism depends on the fact that things, which may differ from one another in time, space, material nature, and many other limitative characteristics, can possess and exhibit the same essential quality - Titus Burckhardt ( Alchemy ) Astrological Inaccuracy and Fallacy No ancient astrologer or diviner believed, as the exoteric astrologers do now, that rocks floating in distant parts of space, affect consciousness. Nothing of this kind was taught, and nothing could be further from the actual truth. If the planet Mars exploded tomorrow, it does not mean that the human proclivities, represented by Mars, will disappear from consciousness. As my Taroscopic System ™ advocates, the zodiac is within . I refer to it as the \"Living Oracle.\" The external planets have no strange effect on consciousness, at least not enough to affect one's fate. It is a fundamental error and the basis of great metaphysical confusion to postulate otherwise.

Schwaller de Lubicz ( Sacred Science ) As we all know science began with the stars, and mankind discovered in them the dominants of the unconscious, the “gods,” as well as the curious psychological qualities of the Zodiac: a complete projected theory of human character – Carl Gustav Jung The present fallacy exists because of clever and patient tampering, over time, with the fundamental postulates and undergirding philosophy of the ancient science of astrology, and its sister disciplines. We can surmise, that the same forces who conspired to vehemently slaughter, plunder, massacre and desecrate the ancient oracles, shamans, witches, mystics, gnostics, diviners, and who put entire nations to the sword would hardly, after all their successful efforts, leave those very arts practiced by their victims in perfect pristine condition. It was these arts that they were after in the first place, and that they wanted to appropriate and suppress. Therefore, if we still find the divination arts in existence, which we do, it goes without saying that they cannot be in their original, uncontaminated form. They must be distortions, and do betray this fact not only by being disconnected from one another, but from frequently yielding erroneous advice. The elites within Judeo- Christianity knew that mere suppression of these arts was not going to work. Suppression would force the practice underground, for the great arts were far too ingrained into the minds and hearts of the ordinary people of the ancient world. Better, then, to gradually tweak them, warp them, and eviscerate them, so they may appear to exist and work, when in fact they work only imperfectly. The high arts of Divination now suffer from being disconnected from one another, and from being studied, taught, used and researched as separate divided subjects. This travesty alone betrays a malign influence. Few scholars in recent times have correctly researched the particular vision, and teachings, of the ancestors. We, therefore, encourage the reader to peruse the works of Jordan Maxwell, Gerald Massey and the other scholars mentioned above, to come into some legitimate understanding of how the mighty Egyptian Siderealists saw the mysteries of Life, Being and the Universe, for unless we get back to that vision we as a species are doomed to utter destruction. And no amount of \"isms\" and \"ologies\" will ever prevent it. Ultimately, the student must eventually begin sincerely researching Astro-Theology, the subject of subjects. Astro-Theology, the \"Religion of the Stars,\" is also called siderealism, sabeanism and uranography. It is from this great subject that common astrology and astronomy derive. Any study of these cannot, in any way, be complete without comprehension of their parent: Astro-Theology. On this site we endeavor to resurrect this subject of Astro-Theology, especially in its vital connection to the Divination Arts of Astrology and Tarot. Those with independent minds and open hearts, please read on. The tarot contains indeed the mystery of all such transmutations of personages into sidereal bodies and vice versa. The “wheel of Enoch” is and archaic invention, the most ancient of all, for it is found in China. Eliphas Levi says there was not a nation but had it, its real meaning being preserved in the greatest secrecy. It is a universal heirloom - Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky Origin of the Tarot The modern exoteric scholars and would-be occult buffs are unaware of the actual antiquity of the Tarot, believing it to date from post- Hellenic times. The secret of the origin of the cards are contained within the cards themselves, within their striking, and enigmatic imagery. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (7 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The fact of the matter is, and should be understood by all, the Tarot is purely Egyptian in origin. ...according to the ancient Greek philosopher Iamblichus, a series of 22 frescoes identical to the Tarot Major Arcana once adorned the walls of a secret underground gallery accessed through labyrinthine passages. Priests wishing to be indoctrinated into the meaning of these frescoes entered the subterranean passage through a door in the breast of the Great Sphinx. The novice priest would then repeatedly encounter the sphinx motif within this secret gallery. The frescoes lining each wall were said to be flanked by sphinx-like caryatids, 24 in all, and to be lit by 11 crystal oil lamps shaped n the form of sphinxes. A sphinx was also prominently displayed in Fresco 10 (Arcanum 10 of the Tarot), the last fresco in the sequence 0 through 10 which together depicted the science of creation... Also, Arcanum 21 (the final pictogram in the series) depicted the four zodiac signs of the sphinx distributed symmetrically around a large wreath. Moreover, the initiated priests wore a the symbol of the Rose Cross around their necks on a golden chain. This bore the four signs of the sphinx, the bull, the lion, eagle and water-bearer, distributed symmetrically around the rose between each arm of the cross - John Baptiste Pitois ( History of Magic ) Remains of the original Tarot designs can be seen today in ruins of the temples of Thebes, capital of Egypt in 2000 BC, particularly on ancient ceilings in the halls of the palace of Medinet-Abou. Moreover, the 22 major cards are also found paralleled in the Book of the Dead, etched into stone crypts as vignettes or world sketches thousands of years ago - Tony Bushby ( The Secret in the Bible ) Elite Subterfuge Those who decry and prohibit the use of Divination to the ordinary man, who subtly control the bodies, minds, emotions and life-force of the under-classes, have used the same for their own advance and empowerment. These following pages constitute a humble attempt to draw attention to the manner in which this control and subterfuge operates. The early Church fathers prohibited astrology and the Great Council of Toledo banned it forever. Nevertheless six hundred years later the dates of the Pope's coronation were determined by the zodiac, the church hierarchy employed their own astrologers; and signs of the zodiac appeared all over Church furnishings, tiles, doorways, manuscripts and baptismal fonts.

Many of the symbols that surround the Biblical Jesus, and many of the things that he is made to do, are analogous to events which occurred 2,000 years previously. Due to the great scholarship of a few diligent writers, the truth of the historicity of Christ is slowly coming to light. The Bible, from beginning to end, and many of its characters, including Jesus, are resciptions of earlier personages - from Egypt. The information presented on this, and on following pages, contain the reasons and evidence for such a statement. The Jesus mediated to us by the Church is not the true Jesus. That is an artificial construction, assembled from true and false fragments of his biography, from authentic and invalid statements, and based on a great deal of inventiveness on the part of the Christian writers - Holger Kersten ( The Original Jesus ) ... this whole affair of which we speak and preach, and which is called Gospel, has no reference at all to any person that ever existed, or events that ever occurred upon earth - Rev.

During this rite the male's entire body was considered a phallus and was anointed accordingly. This originated from the rites of the Egyptian earth god Geb, and from the Hindu god Shiva. Geb's symbol, in Egypt, and still today, was the phallic obelisk reaching up from earth toward the sky, to the Goddess consort Nuith. Shiva's symbol was the Lingam stone, which was, and still is, ritually anointed with white milk representing the semen.

Bishop Theodoret, writing in the Fifth Century, provided further conformation that Jesus was not one of the “krist” personalities although many others of his time were...The son of Poseidon and Meduse was called Khryst and the priests of Apollo were known as Khyrstes. In fact, the word Kristo and its derivations, Krst, Krist, Kristo, Khyst, and Krish-na, all appeared in every ancient religious system and showed the original Kristo concept was believed to be the personal and invisible mediator and guide between God and everything spiritual in man. The Krist concept has been an ancient religious tradition continually suppressed by the Catholic church through the centuries - Tony Bushby ( The Bible Fraud ) According to Bishop Epiphanius, the Krist is the spiritual self within each person - Tony Bushby ( The Bible Fraud ) This anointing was commonly carried out by women, that is by ordained female archimandrites or priestesses. For this reason the Christian Gospels made sure to denigrate Mary Magdalene, the priestess who anointed Jesus with very costly spikenard. It is said of Mary and the women around Jesus that they \"ministered unto him of their substance\" - Picket & Prince ( The Templar Revelation ) More importantly, we have to understand that the Christ is a figure largely based on the Sun. The \"Son\" of God, the Light of the World, is really the \"Sun\" of God, the Light of the World. This is not as heretical as it may first sound, for when we do our homework, and when we open our eyes, we will discover that the elites within Judeo-Christianity know this all too well. In fact, their predecessors are the ones who decided, as many other pagan peoples had already done, to personify the Sun as a man. As diligent researchers know, monotheism - the belief in one god - is not a creation of Judaism. It was a concept known thousands of years previously.

Each Cult, until the point when they joined together, absorbed the mythologies and beliefs of those antecedent. All used astrology but each Cult made changes to the lexicon of the past, to the canon of the Gnosis regarding this subject of subjects. We are inheritors of all these contentions and alterations. And from our pedestal, looking back through the generations, we have anything but a true perspective. The lives and beliefs of our earliest predecessors are especially obscured by time and obsolescence. Moreover, our perspective has been consciously distorted by malign influences within the post-Industrial cabals of learning, by http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (11 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com those at the helm of the faculties of history, anthropology, mythology, and religion, etc,. The Great Cabal The great Cults finally decided to unite their forces and, instead of being in constant competition for the minds of men, to make it all so much easier for themselves by consolidating resources and agendas. This event of monumental importance, this forming of the world's first corporation, occurred in the area today referred to as \"Israel.\" Though the traditional histories avoid this fact, it is spoken of allegorically, in the Bible and in other tales and fictions. In fact, it is the reason why Israel has its very name. Israel, is made up of the names of the three deities the ancient Cults: Isis, Ra and El (Moon, Sun and Saturn). As the most adept scholars know, there were no twelve tribes of Israel. This concept of the twelve roving tribes was a deliberately concocted fiction designed to conceal much more surreptitious, but important, occurrences and themes. The fiction was the creation of the great Cults of power, whose elites commissioned Roman and Jewish writers and historians to randomly and prejudiciously translate many old texts and myths, and include them into what would become the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, and to flagrantly distort Semitic and Egyptian history so as to prevent the curious from discovering the existence and agendas of those archaic Cults, fraternities, and occult colleges which seek habitually to remain invisible. ...Nay, not only are there no proofs of the twelve tribes of Israel having ever existed, but Herodotus, the most accurate of historians, who was in Assyria when Ezra flourished, never mentions the Israelites at all...How is this possible? - Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky ( The Secret Doctrine, vol 3) The history of astrology, myth and religion, cannot be fully understood without a deep study of these elusive Cults, and the manner in which they have succeeded in concealing their existence. Though they have left few tracks to follow, so to speak, their symbolism pervades our world. They do hide, but they hide in plain sight. Their Bible, and other scriptures, give us some insight into their existence and operations, and though their own direct activity is difficult to trace, the machinations of those in their employ is more conspicuous, especially to those who have learned what to look for, and how to look for it. Beneath the broad tide of human history there flow the stealthy undercurrents of the secret societies, which frequently determine in the depths the changes that take place upon the surface - A. E. Waite (Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn) Infernal Pacts The coming together of the Cults did not happen overnight. It was a long and tedious process. The major denominations, like those of today, were no lovers of each other. It was financial and material incentives which motivated them to combine their resources and intentions.

Moreover, each Cult's hierarchy feared that the other Cults may unite against them. So, because of this fear, and because of insatiable greed, each Cult agreed that confederation was expedient. From the time of their infernal pact, they realized that all that was needed for total dominion over minds and lands, was the ability to convincingly wave \"God\" in people's faces. From that point onward the rest would be easy. The leaders of the seven great Cults of power (Seven Churches), decided that rather than fighting amongst themselves for supremacy over the ancient world, they should combine forces. Each Cult feared that they could be deposed if the others conspired in concert against it. This conjunction of Cults did not happen immediately or quickly. It took several centuries. The Old Testament contains the story of this coming together. The elite dynasties of these Cults operate, through their descendants, in this world today, and are extremely powerful - Jordan Maxwell (From: Secret Societies and Toxic Religion ) The Empire (Rome) gradually absorbed and adapted to its own ends the multitude of cults derived from all its parts and over the ensuing centuries coupled them together as one, the Roman universal church. Today, it is called the Roman Catholic church. Henceforth, much of the literature then written was aimed at propagating a fabricated faith to the world and ensuring Roman Emperors were given places as heads of church and state - Tony Bushby ( The Bible Fraud ) The slow attempts to unite the Cults (\"Seven Churches\") is even mentioned in the Bible itself, albeit in language which is veiled and cryptic: Then I went down to the potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel...And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it - Jeremiah 18 A Matter of Time Time itself was divided to reflect and commemorate the unification of the Cults. The year round was broken down into 12 months to honor the Solar Cult. Their god was the sun and his number was 12. The next division of time was a month and, as the word's etymology indicates, this was sacred to the Lunar Cult, whose chief tutelary deity was the moon. The next division of time is a week, in which the 7 gods of the Stellar Cult are honored. These are today's days of the week.

The hands of a physical timepiece have, for generations, concealed and revealed this sectioning of time according to the Cults. The hour hand represents Horus, the sun. The minute hand stands for Min, the moon-god. The fast moving second hand stands for Mercury, the god of the Stellar Cult, as do the 12 divisions. On elaborately designed watches and clocks, the hands often display circles upon them, to illustrate that they represent planetary orbs. Flags contain stars, moons, and solar orbs. Islamic and oriental countries still portray the crescents and stars, which clearly indicate the actual origins of their religions. The use of symbols to convey meaning to the initiated and to conceal it from the uninitiated is as old as civilization. A clear understanding of the symbolic way of thinking is necessary if are to unveil and comprehend the \"esoteric\" (hidden or secret) meaning of the symbols of ancient and modern times - (Jack Benjamin's introduction for Symbols, Sex and the Stars ) The descendants of the great Cults still exist today. They are in control of all the world's governments, for as Jordan Maxwell has pointed out: There is no government which is not somewhat religious, and no religion which is not somewhat political...Religion and Politics are two arms serving the same brain - (From: Secret Societies and Toxic Religion ) OVERVIEW OF THE CULTS As scholars like Jordan Maxwell have labored to pointed out, our modern religions began somewhere, sometime. They each have date of birth and have not always been with us. When we delve into the question of the origins of religion we eventually discover that religious institutions developed out of several major old-world Cults, that is, from powerful theocratic and political dynasties and forces. There were seven major Cults of the ancient world, and several minor ones. Of the seven major Cults, four were of the greatest significance. They have changed form and name down through the ages but they are not expired. The descendants of these Cults are the rulers of the present world-system. They are the \"Over-World\" figures that we rarely, if ever, hear about or see. The People's Champions\" that we do see on the public stage are often merely employed minions of these Plutocratic \"Over-Classes.\" The Cults are as follows, with the first four being the most important: Stellar Lunar http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (14 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Saturnian Solar Vulcanus (Fire Cult) Dionysian (drug, or psychedelic Cult) Venusian (Cult of Venus) The Stellar Cult Before the corruption of the great Cults, motives were pure and nature was revered, studied and served. The first of the great cults was the Sidereal or the Stellar. Their totem symbol was, and still is, the serpent and/or the pentagram or star. It is to these Siderealists that we owe almost all the knowledge of reality that we possess. The Cults which followed them merely emulated their way, absconding with their teachings and using these to embellish their own doctrines. It was the Stellar Cult who discovered the mysteries of the stars, and who created the high sciences of astrology and astronomy. They were also great mathematicians and geometrists. They were the builders of the pyramid, the sphinx, and the other great cyclopean megalithic sites all over the globe. They excelled in navigation and used the stars to guide them on the high seas. Their findings and subsequent creations, in writing or stone, are the foundation upon which all the historical ages rest. Should anyone doubt this, they should spend some time visiting the great capitol cities of the west and observing the design and layout of them all. Most importantly, the Stellar Cult created and utilized the Divination Arts. It is from them that the true esoteric Tarot comes. In order for the phallocratic, hierarchical, masculine and monotheistic (Solar) religions to take hold, and rise to dominance, it was essential that the Stellar, and Lunar Cults of Egypt, India, Ireland and the world, be systematically undermined and eventually eradicated. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (15 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The Egyptians had no vicarious atonement, no imputed righteousness, no second-hand salvation. No initiate in the Osirian mysteries could possibly have rested his hope of reaching heaven on the Galilean line of glory. His was the more crucial way of Amenta...to tread with the guidance of the word, that step by step and act by act he must himself make true - Gerald Massey ( Egypt - Light of the World ) The Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks and Romans, had no word in their language for sin: the Israelites introduced both the word and the concept into the stream of Western civilization and by doing so diverted it - Leonard Schlain ( The Alphabet Versus the Goddess ) The Stellar Cult first conceived of government under Divine Justice, and of the right of kingship (sic, kin-ship). It was they who decided to convey and preserve the great secrets concerning the nature of the universe, of the human biology, of procreation and of life in general, through the means of parable, allegory and mythological fiction. The entire dimensions of the Great Pyramid at Giza are, for instance, encapsulated within the 52 cards of the ordinary playing deck. Most of our nursery rhymes also originate with this Cult. They all contain profound esoteric secrets. The Role of Women During the tenure of the Stellar Cults women held superior positions in society, religion and government. It was the periodicity of the female gestation cycles that initially awakened humans to the inherent order of the universe outside them, and that drew their attention to the night sky which has always, henceforth, been regarded as the \"body\" of the goddess. The perceived order of the universe was, hitherto, always styled and worshipped as a female mother goddess. This goddess was known, by various names, depending upon the Cult and the correlations. She was known as Taurt (Tarot), Nuit, Nun, Ma'at, Isis, Hathor, Sophia, and Mara or Mary. The epithet Ma'at (Mahat, Mayat, Maut, Maht, etc,) is the root of the very words matter, material, mate, mathematics and measure. Throughout the ages of history it was never forgotten by the ancients how the biological cycles of the individual female were in total complementarity with the so-called \"external\" world of phenomena. In fact, the ancients preferred to consider that they lived inside the body of the goddess Nuith, or Ma’at. It was Rudolf Bultmann, the German Biblical scholar, who cited certain passages in the Gospels...as interpolations of Sophia herself, put into the mouth of Christ - Caitlin Matthews ( Sophia: Goddess of Wisdom ) The Suppression of Women One of the main reasons why the knowledge of the Sidereal Cult is kept obscure is to keep women divorced from their power in ways that are barely understood. When woman are, and the feminine principle is, kept in a fallen state the masculine \"Yang\" modality and mentality which is so spirit denying and destructive can easily be insinuated into consciousness and culture. Our own times bear sufficient testimony to this differentiation. Males immortal live, renewed by female deaths - William Blake The history of civilization appears to be a sorry, one-sided history of domination by man...almost invariably the basic cultural pattern has been the work of man. Whole areas of history are darkened by the ignorance of man of the truth that they can create only through the feminine in their own natures just as they procreate in the world without through the woman alone - Laurens http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (16 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com van der Post ( Jung and the Story of Our Times ) When we look back across the historical time of patriarchy...there seems to be some terrible inevitability, a relentless desire to crush the female essence, human and divine. The question of why is one of the most puzzling of our time - Leonard Schlain ( The Alphabet Versus the Goddess ) Many of the ancient peoples were Siderealists, the early Semites, Indo-Aryans, the Chaldeans, Teutons and Celts, etc,. The Semitic and Roman calendars began at sunset. The Druids and the Shamans of the Maya also arose at night and marked time primarily from the passages and phases of Venus and the Moon. The Siderealists had complete knowledge of the measurements of the earth, and even the neighboring planets were charted by them in detail. They were the fathers of astronomy. They are the original Magi spoken of in the religious tomes and the one we know as the Christ and other figures such as Merlin, Abaris, Pythagoras, Apollonius, Ovid, Virgil, Valentinus, Basilides (and many more among the ranks of the persecuted), were scions of the Sidereal Cult. Christ even remonstrates to his disciples \"Be ye as wise as Serpents.\" This doesn’t make much sense until we discover that the serpent was the prime symbol of the Stellar Cult, the \"wise-ones\" of old. And, what's more, the Egyptian hieroglyphic for \"woman\" was a serpent. This is one of the reasons why the serpent was considered negative by later Christians. The word ritual , comes from ritu, meaning \"the blood-red\", and the word secret, comes from secretion which implies the female biological cycle. Moreover, the Egyptian word for woman was mesta , from which we derive Mystery. The Solar Cult Proto-astrology was not, as it is now, premised upon a Solar-Theology, since the sun on its annual rotation physically and symbolically equates with ephemerality and wane, with time and evolution through time. The twelve signs were seen as twelve aspects of consciousness. They represented the innate categories of consciousness. The sun stands for the human ego, the hero, who must, like a novice, pass through the twelve \"school-rooms\" before it can be pure and wise enough to know the secret of the universe. The Stellar Cult understood that the personal horoscope is a projection of one's inner Republic. It represents the strengths and weaknesses that we possess. It is an external image of the interaction between our Dharma and Karma, the masculine and feminine modalities of our being, and of the interactivity of psychic and physical energy. To the Stellar Cult, the sun was not considered the center of the zodiac, because the ego was not considered the center of human consciousness. The properties of the sun, analogous to the properties of the ego, were not as revered as they are today. It was understood, by the ancient Magi, that the light of ego-consciousness was not sufficient to illumine all the mysteries of the Self. To cast a beam of light onto something only ensures that everything that is not within that beam is cast into darkness. Light may highlight and clearly reveal one small area but must, as a result, cast all else into shadow. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (17 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Metaphysically, the situation is exactly the same. If we find ourselves in ignorance today, about almost everything that matters, there is a reason. The reason has to do with the machinery and mechanics of light. As the sun literally draws a veil of light across the body of the mysteries (the night sky and the stars) so the human ego (our \"inner sun\" so to speak) also draws a veil of psychic luminescence over our true inner essence and source. We have little idea what this means today because we have been indoctrinated, even intimidated, by thousands of years of Judeo-Christianity and the orthodox hegemonies of those aligned and obsessed with solar propaganda. Women, nature, quietitude and darkness are equated with evil. Lifestyle and human motivation become expressions of aggression, acquisition and conquest over other entities. Whether direct, canalized or sublimated, this acquisitive, graduating movement of a personal and collective ego, is circumscribed by periodicity and time. Its signature is rise and fall, wax and wane. Conversely, the stars are the symbol of all that is eternal, everlasting, complimentary and mutual. The Solar Cult's main tenets and philosophies can still be found encapsulated in the Bible's Old and New Testaments. Christianity is patently a Solar-Centric Theology, and whether its modern-day adherents know or accept this or not is unimportant. Facts cannot be changed to fit opinions. Christianity's god and son of god were originally associated with the sun and the stars. As late as the fifth and sixth centuries, the words \"Our Lord, the Sun\" were used by the Christians in their prayers. his same phrase was also used in the liturgy until altered later into \"Our Lord, the God\" - Bozena Brydlova ( Io Unveiled ) I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star - Rev 22:16 it is our contention that the bizarre cornucopia of Biblical pseudo-theology were created by elites within the Solar Cult for the purpose of recording, albeit in cryptic form, their own history and existence. Behind its befuddling phantasmagoria we find a most intriguing and sinister account of dynastic machinations and universal power-mongering, the likes of which a dozen cloned Cecil B. DeMilles, with all the resources of the world, could not possibly have concocted. The Broken Kings (Solar-Theology: Origin and History) Ernest Busenbark reminds us that it was about 3,000 years ago, in the Age of Taurus that the Solar Cults began gaining power. He writes: ... sun worship does not appear to have existed as a distinct and separate system, but was simply grafted on the older cult; and after the two became fused, the sun eventually became the dominant figure. This Solar Cult's chief officialdom were the so-called \"Broken Kings\" of Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty, namely the family of Amenhotep IV (Akhenaton), Smenkhkare, Nefertiti, Kiya, and the boy-king Tutankhamen. This punitive, intolerant, and renegade dynasty, lionized by modern historians, forbade Egyptians from venerating any other god except Aton, or Aten (the sun). http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (18 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com They forcibly closed the great temples, instigated monotheism, and allowed foreign elements in to contaminate the racial purity of the Egyptians. Akhenaton (renamed Mosis, or Moses by later propagandists) was a priest of the Cult of the Sun. His god was Aton (also Adon, or Adonai). Around the year 1361 BC, and after decades of suppression, the Egyptians finally rose up against this decadent dynasty and ousted them from power. The great Pharaoh Horemheb banished them and their many Israelite servants to the outer regions. The story of this exodus is concealed in the Bible's early books and chapters, but the true story has come to light through the work of modern researchers. (See Moustapha Gadalla's Historical Deception ). Three-thousand years later we would find this dynasty reappearing, albeit in a disguised garb, as the dramatis personae of the Bible, rescripted as the great heroes - Solomon, David, Joseph and Jesus, etc,. No such characters ever physically existed at the time when they were said to have lived, or at the locations stipulated. There is not a single shred of evidence for any of these Biblical characters. This is because they are later interpolations, characters designed to resemble earlier figures, whose real presence is well hidden in the shadows of time and history. Surely even Masons would never claim the actual existence of Solomon? As Kenealy shows, he is not noticed by Herodotus, not by Plato, not by any writer of standing. It is most extraordinary he says, “that the Jewish nation, over whom but a few years before mighty Solomon had reigned in all his glory, with a magnificence scarcely equaled by the greatest monarchs, spending nearly eight thousand million of gold on a temple, was overlooked by the historian Herodotus, writing almost necessarily within a few miles of the splendid capital of the national Jerusalem? How can this be accounted for, he asks - Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky ( The Secret Doctrine, vol 3) Where Are They Now? A close reading of the evidence and the history reveals that Tutankhamen (king of the Solar Cult) was the prototype of Jesus - the Christ, the new child-king of the sun. The figure of Jesus Christ was also loosely based upon several other personages who frequented the area around modern day Israel and who had powerful legends attached to them. These figures have now been identified, by various researchers, as Jesus bar Panthera, Judas Khrestus, Apollonius of Tyana, and even Hiram Abiff, the Phoenician-Masonic builder of the Temple of Solomon. But there are resemblances to several other mystical figures, such as the Buddha of the Far East, Mithras, Orpheus, Dionysus, Simon Magus and John \"the Baptist\" (an Essene Leader known as the \"Teacher of Righteousness\"). Jesus, the biographical figure, is a composite character. Scholars spending time trying to find his physical \"original\" are still to comprehend and acknowledge how the person of Jesus was mostly modeled upon the sun, the god of the Solar Cults. The Bible barely disguises this, and yet few have dared to broach this subject, and those who have, like the Rev. Robert Taylor, have languished in dungeons as a result of their audacity. I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star - Rev 22:16 ...the Jesus of history is a living figure, who lived, who moved through life, who died...the Jesus of theology is god...and there isn't really a lot of connection between these two figures. And if we try to connect these two figures we either create bad history, or bad theology - Michael Baigent (author The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail ) After their banishment to the eastern wilderness, these monotheists did not just disappear. They left Egypt with all their wealth, and moved eastward toward Palestine, setting themselves up in Jerusalem. As the secret \"Thirteenth\" tribe of Israel (ostensibly the Levites, and not to http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (19 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com be confused with the Khazars), they commissioned the proto-Freemasons (Phoenicians) to construct the Temple of Solomon (Sol) for them so they could continue and promote their monotheistic cult. From the moment when it first appears as an entity this tribe of Judah has a strange look. It was always cut off, and never got on well with its neighbors. Its origins are mysterious. it seems from the beginning, with its ominous name, somehow to have been set apart... Douglas Reed ( Controversy of Zion ) They demanded an order of existence fundamentally different from that of the people about them. These were differences which allowed of no process of assimilation with others. They demanded separation, absolute differentiation - Dr. Kastein The little tribe in the south, Judah, became identified with the landless tribe, that of the Levites. These hereditary priests who claimed that their office had been bestowed upon them by Jehovah on Mount Sinai were the true fathers of Judaism - Douglas Reed The Cult of Aten (Aton) left Egypt along with the Semitic tribes that had served and lived alongside them in Tell el-Amarna, at the great city of Akhenton. These tribes are today put before us as the \"Israelites,\" - the Jews of later history. Those who became known later as Jews were originally, however, neither Israelites nor Hebrews. The word hebrew derives from Ibaru, an ancient Egyptian term for the \"wise ones.\" It referred to the chief priests, and to the magicians, astrologers, temple builders, and keepers of the secrets. The Ibaru were members of the elect and were near to the House of the Pharaoh. It was these Ibaru. This word had a similarity to Hibaru, which meant wanderer, or shepherd, or foreigner. This unfortunate similarity of etymology has caused great confusion, but has favored the machinations of those elites who crave to keep their true historical identities blurred. The ancient pagans, that is the peoples of other races and countries, knew the meaning of these words, and knew the one from the other. But in the west we don't question the half-truths put before us. The ancients knew that the terms Israelite and Ibaru referred only to high-ranking, spiritually endowed Egyptians. And they knew that Egypt had been visited numerous times by vagabonds, and ne'er do wells, out for what they could get. The outlying provinces of Egypt were often plagued by such miserables, who stole food, polluted wells, and generally caused a disturbance. They were also known to be very unhygienic. More than once did the Egyptian Governors take to banishing and exiling such foreigners who were infecting their people. Thankfully, there are a few western scholars who have seen through the controversy of the identity. Jewish author Max L. Dimont covers the problem in his fine book Jews, God and History. He wrote: Let us pose a hypothetical question: Where the Hebrews who left Ur with Abraham in 2000 BC, and the Hebrews who entered Egypt under Joseph in 1600 BC, the same people as the Israelites who were led out of Egypt by Moses in 1200 BC? Were these Israelites who came out of Egypt the descendents of Abraham, Isaac, and Jocob, or were they a different people?... Dimont goes on to write: ...In Genesis, the book dealing with their history before their entry into Egypt, the Jews are, with one exception, referred to as Hebrews, not as Israelites. After their exodus from Egypt and in the other Books of Moses, the Jews are referred to mostly as Israelites, very seldom as Hebrews. After the exodus, it is the pagans who usually refer to the Jews as Hebrews, whereas the Jews usually refer to themselves as Israelites - Max Dimont ( Jews, God and History ) http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (20 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com We can see from these passages that the people who were exiled to the wilderness with Akhenaton (Moses), were not the Israelites or Hebrews, in the true sense. These terms were falsely and duplicitously adopted at a much later date. After all, name changing was a very common practice in the ancient world. Akhenaton himself had changed his name from Amenhotep. No, the \"Israelites\" were not the people who accompanied the Pharaoh, they were the Pharaoh and his immediate Egyptian coterie. As we have said, this word referred to the high initiates of Egypt. Because they had once ruled in Egypt, the Solar Cult of Aton were revered and obeyed. It was relatively easy for them to weld themselves to the Semitic priestarchies which frequented Palestine. But the Cult of Aton, and their one god, were also feared. We certainly read of their utter ruthlessness in the early chapters of the Old Testament) won them many local enemies. Everyone that stood in their way was crushed or undermined politically. Their patented strategy of diplomacy versus military threat would persist until our present age. From their time in Egypt, they already had diplomatic ties with the Semitic Sumerians, Phoenicians, Hindus (Brahmins) and Babylonians, and with the fanatical Semitic House of Judah (their creation). Later, as time passed, they would find cultivate profitable relationships with powerful forces within the echelons and dynasties of Grecian, Roman, French and English society. In their machinations, they would either make an approach openly through official agents or ambassadors, or if their future host proved overly resistant or wary, they would insinuate themselves gradually by way of a \"Rasputin,\" \"Casanova,\" or \"Nostradamus\" - that is, by way of some elusive and uniquely endowed \"holy\" man or shaman, advisor, or soothsayer, or other Machiavellian reprobate in their employ, who would purposely attract a lot of notoriety in order to attract attention away from his or her real agenda. The history books are full of such characters, and their faked \"rags to riches, back to rags\" biographies provide fodder for the pseudo-history books and the common palate. Nothing has changed today, since many of our present \"People's Champions\" and pop icons are also agents in the employ of this antique and rotten Cult of the Sun. (For more on this, review the DVD - \"Astro-Theology & Sidereal Mythology\") The Piso family of Italy are direct descendents of this original \"holy\" Sun-Clan of Aton. It was they who commissioned the writing of the Bible, in Rome. Naturally, they fashioned it to be a manifesto of their beloved Solar Theocracy, and manufactured the histories of the Nile Valley to fit their own agendas. Not wanting to be seen, or remembered, as tyrannous renegades they ruthlessly suppressed and expunged authentic historical accounts, and carefully rescripted and doctored Egyptian and Israelite history into the strange and unsustainable concoction we find today. Despite the doctoring, however, the work still manages to reveal their true agendas. The Bush family of America, are descendents of the Italian Pisos Upon diligent and unbiased research we can soon discover just how these connoisseurs of power used various strategies to cover their tracks. We find that because of their relative lack of success in merging with the ten tribes of the house of Israel (various spurious polyglot Semitic groups), the Levitical Judahites began seeking other more convenient and sustainable covers behind which to operate. According to orthodox accounts, after the ten tribes of Israel assimilated into the western lands, the Cult of Aton quickly devised another form of camouflage. This was the oppressive Mosaic (Levitical / Pharisaic) religion that would later appear to oppose, and then finally morph into, modern Judeo-Christianity. Based largely on their own Solar Theocracy, it was carefully scripted to appear the sundry biographies of prophets, saints, and martyrs. By the time of the Pisos in Italy, the phantasmagoria of pseudo-theology was compiled in one incoherent http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (21 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com book, and eventually bestowed a aura of holy authenticity, by the Vatican's officialdom under their power. The choice was made to design another more adroit cover, primarily due to the wholesale ransacking of Jerusalem by the Romans during the second destruction of the Temple (35 years after the so-called Crucifixion). Tired of all the uprisings and foment, the Emperor Vespasian ordered the annihilation of Jerusalem. The fury of the attack had the effect of permanently scattering the Judeans far and wide. Though the Levites (Pharisees) would regroup in Jamnia, they were too displaced and exposed a group to be of further use, to their controllers. One hundred years following the sacking and seizure of Israel, the Levites composed their “Law,” epitomized in Deuteronomy which was read aloud in the temple. This was the birth of “Mosaic Law” really created by the Levites and attributed to Moses. It is really Levitical or Judaic law. It is their “political programme.” Deuteronomy means “Second Law” because it stood distinct from the original Israelite law. It was the first book to be completed and is not the fifth book of the Bible - Douglas Reed ( Controversy of Zion ) No mass-Exodus of captives from Jerusalem to Babylon can have occurred, because the mass of the Judahite people, from which a Jewish nation later emerged, was already self-distributed far and wide about the known world...having gone whether conditions for commerce were most favorable - ibid A careful attention to the history of the world for the last eighteen hundred years has shown me, that the priests of all religions have practiced fraud to forward their objects...I cannot forget that the priests of every age have protected, as ours do now protect, impostures, and that in every age numerous examples of pious fraud may be found...Magic is pretty nearly over, but fraud seldom throve better - Godfrey Higgins (Anacalypsis ) These monstrosities lied and blackened the names of the kings of previous dynasties and obscured the spiritual histories of ancient Egypt. They also sent agents to physically desecrate the exquisite celestial monuments and temples of the Nile. This desecration continues to this day. The masses of illiterate and preoccupied peoples and tribes, even if they knew better, were not a force to be reckoned with, and could raise no voice against these literati and their lies, those who systematically suppressed true Gnostics and \"Heretics.\" Their Bible was cunningly embellished with so many familiar mythic motifs, and supernatural anecdotes, that the world's few literate men would have plenty to appease their imaginations. They saw to it that their own true history and advance would be cryptically concealed behind the officially presented stories of the Exodus, the building of the Temple, the conflict between the Houses of Israel and Judah, the Captivity in Babylon, the westward journey of Jeremiah and the 10 tribes, and the various other convoluted, unsustainable fables which, with no evidence to support them, are still taken at face value and zealously accepted chapter and verse. Red Shields and Red Carpets Little of this Oriental history would matter more than a jot if it were not for the fact that many of the most powerful dynasties and families in control of the present world's religions and governments happen to be descended from this Aton bloodline. The reader may have noticed how often we see the major world leaders walking upon a red carpet. This is an old symbol dating back to Jeremiah. The red carpet is a figurative motif representing the blood path, or blood line coming down from the past and running into the future. The guards at the Tower of London also wear the red sash around their wastes for the same reason, and the British troops were know once as the \"Red Coats.\" Today, we often speak of being caught in \"red-tape\" or of being \"in the red,\" when we are \"under the gun\" of the state.

The center of Communist Russia was near \"Red Square.\" The Rothschild dynasty get their name from \"Red Shield.\" This is a reference not to a street in Frankfurt (as we are told) but to their symbolically blood- soaked \"shields\" (as used in battle). This blood is, of course, more than merely figurative. It has come from their many brave enemies, that is, from those who have dared to stand in their way, and expose or thwart their clandestine rampage through history. The plutocratic despots in the public domain may be an overclass, and may belong to secret societies. However, they are not the descendants of non-existent Israelites. That much has, of late, been proven. No, they are not descended from any \"Israelites,\" nor from any \"Judahites.\" The terms \"Israelite,\" \"Judahite,\" and \"Christian,\" have been used as \"cloaking-devices\" behind which the real coherent origins hide. This fact is only being gradually discovered and released to the world. The demagogues of the world have a great deal to lose should their deceptions be exposed. They would literally lose possession of the thrones of the world, and this fear seethes constantly, providing ample motivation for their continued machinations, suppression, and clandestine tampering with world history via duplicitous insider \"historians\" and media savants. ABC Towers in LA (shaped as a Star of David) Piazzi Smyth, a Scot astronomer, evolved the British Israel theory by complicated mathematical calculations in some remote connection with the Great Pyramids upon which he based the claim that the throne of England is the throne of David, and the kings and queens of England Queen Victoria in 1800 and George VI in 1944 - are of the royal lineage of David, and the British people, therefore, the real Israel today, which they claim descends not through Judah or the Jews but from the ten tribes. The true Israel, they claim, does not include Jews but are the Anglo Saxons...Their theoretical views are completely contrary to ethnological history bearing on the origin of the British people and the Anglo-Saxon race, the facts of which the Anglo-Israel authors have the bold audacity to dispute and deny. But their unhistorical claims are no more pretentious than their unscriptural interpretations are presumptuous - Foy E. Wallace Jr. ( God's Prophetic Word ) The Bible is nothing more than the manifesto of a few powerful Cults and families. It is their testament and device for extortion and enslavement. Full of personal details that only insiders could decipher, it allowed a personal family god to become, in time, \"Rex Mundi\" (Lord of the World). ...a most charming political fiction, dreamed up for excellent purposes in the garb of history, and adopted to the gross conceptions of a rude, sensual, unlearned and credulous people - Dr. Geddes (on the early books of the Bible) Investigations into the beginnings of religion have accumulated steadily throughout the past half-century. It is only by great efforts of censorship, by sectarian education of an elaborately protected sort...that ignorance about them is maintained - H. G. Wells ( The Fate of Homo Sapiens ) There is nothing holy about the Bible, nor is it “the word of God.” It was not written by God-inspired saints, but by power- seeking priests. Who but priests consider sin the paramount issue? Who but priests write volumes of religious rites and rituals? No one, but for these priestly scribes were sin and rituals imperatives. Their purpose was to found an awe-inspiring religion. By this intellectual tyranny they sought to gain control, and they achieved it. By 400 BC, they were the masters of ancient Israel. For such a great project they needed a theme, a framework, and this they found in the Creation lore of more knowledgeable races. This they commandeered and perverted – the natural to the supernatural, and the truth to error.

Mack ( Who Wrote the New Testament ) There is not preserved nor is there existent in the world a single original book or manuscript of Hebrew or Christian scriptures containing the inspired word of Yahweh.

Robert Taylor ( The Devil's Pulpit ) This so-called \"god\" (Yahweh-Aton), has no substantial antiquity, and was not known prior to the early centuries AD. Even Moses at the so-called \"burning bush\" had to ask the identity of this \"Jehovah.\" This Yahweh was, and is, merely a rescripting of Aton - god of the Solar Cult, of Saturn - god of the Saturnian Cult (Kronos of the Romans), of the Hindu Trinity of Brahma (ether), Vishnu (water) and Siva (fire), and of Mars, the pagan god of war. He, or rather, It, is venerated by the Freemasons and Knights Templar under the pseudonym Jabulon , which is a composite word made from three gods - Yahweh (Mars), Baal (Saturn), and On (Sun). Many of the major Biblical authors, translators and scholars, and a good many of the bishops, cardinals, popes, and evangelists were, and still are, merely lieutenants of this secret, and fabulously wealthy, Luciferian dynasty. The word \"satan\" simply meant \"one who tempts\" and it merely referred to any contradicting, skeptical or accusatory agent and their argument. Within holy orders, like the Essenes and Gnostics, a \"satan\" was any detractor or opposition party. There was nothing supernatural about a satan. To oppose any hegemony, is therefore to be \"satanic.\" So we see that there is a big difference between satan and Lucifer. Lucifer was originally based on the pagan god Mars. Eventually, satan too became identified with Mars, the red fiery planet and god. In the Bible we have Jesus turning to Peter saying \"get thee behind me satan.\" If we accept Jesus to be the sun, then we can take this statement to be of astro-theological significance. Mars occasionally rises heliacally, that is - with or even before the sun. The priests of the sun, in the Solar-Cult, would exclaim from their temples \"get thee down\" or \"get thee below\" or \"get thee behind, satan,\" in order to not have their deity be ousted, rivaled and outshined. Interestingly, the symbol of Mars (an arrow) can be seen (in miniature) on the central panel of the rosette window above the door of number 10 Downing Street in London, England. This is the center of the British Government. The word ten, also comes from Aten (Aton) Nowhere in the Genesis account is there any mention, direct or indirect, of Satan’s involvement, and yet it has become common practice for the Church to portray the serpent as an emissary of Satan, or even as Satan himself - Laurence Gardner So, let it be known how that which we call the \"Christian Church\" is, like the Vatican ( vaticanus - \"place of the sorcerers\"), the creation of this Cult of Aton-Adonai-Lucifer, and, as a result, all its innumerable crimes against humanity can be laid at their blood-soaked doors. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (24 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com It is very plainly put in arcane literature that Jehovah was originally a Lord of Mars.

The spiritual rituals of the former were abandoned and little heed was paid to the sacred knowledge that had been amassed. Any occult knowledge that was possessed by the sorcerers of the Aton Cult would to be used solely to undermine their enemies and to steer humanity into chaos and ruin. The focus of worship was moved from the pantheistic and esoteric outlook to the monotheistic and exoteric. Instead of the night sky and the constellations, it was the day and the lone sun which became the symbol for deity. All future world religions would bear antique motifs, but worship would fixate on a homogenous source-point. When we read or hear about the coming of \"Christianity\" we are really hearing the history of this change of philosophical and theocratic paradigm, which explains why there are so many seemingly fantastic and inexplicable events occurring around the personality of Christ. These have been put in front of us as legitimate biographical anecdotes which must be accepted on faith or as \"miracles\" which can never be rationally explained. According to the story, after baby Jesus is being \"born\" in Bethlehem, he and his parents are visited by three \"wise men\" bearing gifts. Into the stable come three kings with three symbolic gifts. The nature of the gifts and the number of visitors alerts the student to the hidden implication of the Nativity story. Not only do the three Magi represent the three great cults (other than the Solar), the symbols they bear indicate that they are paying supplication to the Solar King, the new power \"in town,\" so to speak. Frankincense, is amber-like in its natural resinous form. It was burned in the temples of the sun. Likewise, Myrrh is resinous, and both it and Frankincense are sacred to the sun, occasionally being referred to, figuratively, as the tears of the sun. And gold, obviously, also represents the sun. In fact, it is one of the sun's major symbols. All in all, the \"Nativity\" tale is a propaganda story for the Solar Cult. In this tale the three other Cults symbolically bow down and pay tribute to the new Cult which is to dominate them, and the world. Christ then, like the Pope now, is only a symbol for the sun. Moreover, many times in Christian art Jesus is depicted with a bright solar halo, and is often shown holding the \"Shepherd's Crook.\" This is a symbol of the Egyptian Pharaohs who, ages before, where known as the \"Shepherds\" of their people. Additionally, the largest and most influential Christian Evangelist television network in the United States is called, suggestively, DAYSTAR corporation. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (25 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com For more on these Stellar myths, review the DVD - Astro-Theology & Sidereal Mythology Among the many symbols used, the sun is often represented by the \"All Seeing Eye\" of the god of light. This symbol is, suggestively, seen above an Egyptian pyramid. It has been called the eye of Ra, or of Horus, but it is really the eye of Aton/Jehovah/Adonai, the god of the monotheistic Akhenaton and his bloodline. Those who worship this god, those behind the thrones of power today, refer to themselves as the \"Illumined Ones,\" or the \"Elites.\" Within their enclaves they know themselves as \"Luciferians\" as is known by those researchers who have taken the time to read their various manifestos. This symbol, of the all-seeing eye, can be seen emblazoned on the documents of the nefarious and powerful secret society, called the Illuminati, which infiltrated Freemasonry (and other guilds and institutions), and on the American one dollar bill. Adjacent to this symbol, on the dollar bill, is the bald eagle with the thirteen arrows and olive leaves. This eagle is the symbol for the Tribe of Manasseh, and was also used by the Rothschild Dynasty (one of the major servants of the descendents of the renegade Cult of Aton). The pyramid with the eye can also be seen today on innumerable corporate logos, on the emblems of governments, religious organizations, and on many media consortiums, which are either owned or controlled by these selfsame oligarchies. Neither the pyramid nor the eagle are American symbols. And let us bear in mind, from now on, that the generic terms \"Israelite\" and \"Hebrew\" denote those people who had spent time in Egypt, and is not specifically a racial or religious term. These terms were used more as titles, and were adopted to signify the Jews and other sundry tribes and racial groups that were once resident in Egypt and who were fond affiliates, and even servants of, the Cult of Aton (Adonai/Jehovah/Yahweh). The non-racial term \"Israelite\" was adopted by those without legitimate claim to such ancestry and by those who seek to disguise their origins. Since scholars, and history, can find little trace of any \"Israelties\" the ruse was an excellent one, and has worked supremely well thus far. Note A : The term \"Israelite,\" was a sacred Egyptian term and referred to the knowledgeable ones. The word Israel , as we saw, was later adopted to express the coming together of the Cults of Power. This is probably the reason why the term Israelite was used by each Cult, including the Solar Cult of Aton. It is a term which connotative rather than denotative. The same thing applies to the Welsh, Scotts, Irish and English when they refer to themselves as \"British.\" When the Bible was being conceived, in Rome, it was decided that the word and concept of Israel should be personified. For reasons which are NOT detailed, Jacob - son of Abraham - was renamed Israel by God. This act of \"renaming\" (Genesis 35:9) is just one of several clever ploys used by the Bible's mythographers in Babylon and Rome to distort history and to leave false trails. Note B: The labyrinthine nonsense of the Bible only seems complicated because modern Christians attempt to distinguish themselves from Jews by saying that they are descended from all twelve tribes, whereas the Jews are only descended from one tribe, that of Judah, the fourth son of Jacob. Once we realize that neither the Christians nor the Jews can prove any such descent, all is made clear. And putting words into the mouth of Jesus which indicate that he was also fixated on his physical lineage was a shoddy manner of legitimizing these unsustainable claims. Obviously, if Jesus was indeed born of a virgin, by way of the Holy Spirit, and not from his physical father Joseph, as the New Testament asserts, then he can have no lineage other than a divine one. The Christians who assert a connection to ancient lost tribes are in contradiction to the message of Christ. Only those who do not care about Christ's moral and spiritual message, and who desire to connect themselves to the god Jehovah, and his \"Covenant\" of power and dominion, waste their time with physical descent. Such types betray the fact that it is physical, and material power and sovereignty that concerns them, not spiritual and moral. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (26 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Such individuals should call themselves what they truly are - Levites, Pharisees, hypocrites and liars all, wallowing in contradiction and dancing on the strings pulled from above by the forces that created the whole drama, from their Babylonian Academies and Roman Scriptoriums. Note C: The \"Tribe of Manasseh\" like all other tribes, have long since departed from history, if they ever existed at all. There is precious little to support the existence of this, or any other \"Israelite\" tribe. The fiction of the ten tribes is a conveniently holy sounding device, or ruse, behind which the devilish Solar Cult can remain hidden. Let it be known that when we read the terms Israel, Israelite, Hebrew, Chosen, etc., we are to think - Judahite, Levite, Pharisee, and Cult of Aton. This will make reading and understanding the \"scriptures\" a great deal easier. (The Levites were always considered a tribe apart. Their duties were mostly militaristic and administrative, but they had particular jurisdiction over temple sacrifices). In short, never let us forget that the Bible is a propaganda manifesto with little to no historical or biographical veracity. As historians frustrate themselves searching for non-existent old-world tribes, the Cult of Aton hides in plain sight, to ply its abominable trade and spread its infection the world over. Its chiefs dance upon their desks in merriment over our ignorance and folly. But, take an English man, bury his dead corpse in Wales and wait for a thousand years to pass by. Then dig him up, take him to China, and label the find \"Ancient Scottish Chieftain found buried for a thousand years.\" The Chinese will be your best customers. Even if he were to be compared to an authentically dead Englishman or a Welshman, your dead Scotsman gimmick is likely to remain safe, sound and lucrative, especially if your critics still have to buy a ticket from you to glean proof of their skepticism. The adoption of the name “Israel” by the Zionist state which was set up in Palestine in 1948 was transparent false pretense - Douglas Reed ( Controversy of Zion ) The encyclopedia Britannica says that Judaism developed long after the Israelites had merged themselves with mankind... ibid ...Nay, not only are there no proofs of the twelve tribes of Israel having ever existed, but Herodotus, the most accurate of historians, who was in Assyria when Ezra flourished, never mentions the Israelites at all...How is this possible? - Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky ( The Secret Doctrine, vol 3) Anything like a pure bred tribe of Judah must have disappeared some centuries before Christ, at the latest - Douglas Reed ( Controversy of Zion ) The Latin inscription on the banner around the Judaic eagle's head (below the Star of David) - E Pluribus Unum (\"From the Many - the One\") refers to the god of the henotheistic Judahites, who was, quite literally, chosen from the many gods of antiquity, and not to any high- fluting concept of Fabian Humanism. It is also a cryptic reference to the separatist, monotheistic, light-worshipping Cult of Aton, who have hidden their very physical ancestry behind the myriad cults, religions and secret societies of history, many of which are of their own creation. Because they have concealed themselves behind the so-called twelve tribes of \"Israel,\" their denoting number is thirteen. This number appears all over the US one dollar note, and appears on many national flags, coins and coats-of-arms.

The thirteen levels of the pyramid and the thirteen stars above the eagle's head, together with every other emblem therein, represent the Ancient Cults, and the Solar Cult of Aton which conceals itself behind Judaism, Christianity, and behind secret societies such as the Knights of Columbus, the Knights Templar, the Freemasons, Jesuits, and the Illuminati, etc,. If we look closely, we will see 33 feathers in the wing of Aton’s Eagle. This number represents the Masonic Order, which has 33 main degrees of initiation in its hierarchical, pyramidical structure. This occult family, of Aton, sits at the top of the power pyramid, and has designed, funded and controlled operations through the time of the Levites, Pharisees, Greeks, Romans, Venetians, the Hanovers of Holland, the royal elites of England (Plantagenet, Tudor, Stuart and Windsor dynasties), through the world's first exploitatory conglomerates such as the East-Indian Company and Russell Trust (Virginia and Hudson Bay Companies), which were behind the \"discovery\" of America's original thirteen states (New Israel), and which own and control both political parties within America today. This cabal also funds and controls the world's major charities, the majority of the US Christian Protestant (pro-Zionist) Evangelist Pastors, the newspapers and media networks for the youth, the music and pharmaceutical monopolies, the Federal Reserve and its banks, the United Nations, the Vatican and the Jesuits, and the major think-tanks and space programs (NASA - \" ...the Eagle has landed \"). The symbols on the currency (notes and coins) that government (British and American) buys from the private banks in order to sustain its existence, furnish the student with proof-positive as to the truth of this last statement. Moreover, the terms \"Camp David\" and \"Capitol Hill\" are oblique references to the city of Jerusalem, and to Levite tradition. The term \"breaking the law\" is an oblique reference to Moses (Akhenaton) literally breaking the Law of the Covenant.

Therefore, there are always a few individuals within the secret societies enclaves who refuse to simply roll-over and play dead in front of the influence of the Cult of Aton. Initially, some of these societies and fraternities were dedicated to the uplift of humanity and to the preservation of sacred knowledge. Originally, even the Freemasons had very little whatsoever to do with revolution and political intrigue. That is why we find warning calls going out from the highest echelons within Freemasonry foretelling, and finally lamenting, the infiltration of powerful and extremely malign influences. Unfortunately, the warnings went largely unheard. ...We see our edifice...crumbling and covering the ground with ruins, we see the destruction that our hands no longer arrest...a great sect arose, which taking for its motto the good and the happiness of man, worked in the darkness of the conspiracy to make the happiness of humanity a prey for itself.

Written to Brethren in 1794) I have been convinced that we, as an Order, have come under the power of some very evil occult Order, profoundly versed in science both occult and otherwise, though not infallible, their methods being BLACK MAGIC, that is to say, electro-magnetic power, hypnotism and powerful suggestion. We are convinced that the Order is being controlled by some Sun Order, after the nature of the Illuminati, if not by that Order itself - The Duke of Brunswick (Grand Master of World Freemasonry, 1700s) The Knights of the Temple of Solomon After the Knights Templar entered into Jerusalem, during the Crusades, and after they took over the Temple Mount as their base, they were approached and eventually infiltrated by the oriental Cult of Aton. The Templars became converted to their cause and have been serving them ever since. They have occasionally changed their name and their address, and have used other ruses to disguise their agendas and leadership, but they have long been under the tutelage and jurisdiction of the Aton Cult. Through these complicit Templars, the Cult of Aton has been busy working behind the scenes of the world's governments and through the medical and pharmaceutical monopolies. The Priory de Sion One of the secret societies that they formed, when in France, is known as the Priory de Sion. This is one of the most illustrious and most powerful secret societies in the world. Scholars know that this Templar-Freemasonic order takes its name, Sion (pronounced Sheeon ), from the first letters of the Holy Family of Egypt - Set, Isis, Osiris and Nephthys. These deities are sacred to all Egyptians and to those whose family tree comes down from Egypt. The word ON, is an Egyptian term, meaning - the Sun.

One of the Priory's main bases in France is in the province of Lorraine. The symbol for the province, and the Dukes, of Lorraine is the double cross. This symbol was used by the so-called French \"Underground,\" and is seen on the Exxon oil corporation of America today. Exxon is Esso, in England. An \"Exxon\" (like a Page) is, in reality, an official of a royal court, and acts as a messenger or spokesperson for royalty . The word Sion can also be spelled Xion (since Si in Greek is Xi). This is similar to Exxon. In numerology, the letters SION, are 1965. These numbers also give, by way of transposition and Gematria, ROSE (9615). The word and symbol of the Rose have often been used as a cryptic cover for the Cult of Aton, and their many secret society servants, for instance the Rosicrucians (L'Ordre de la Rose-Croix). We still use the term \"double-crossed\" today, when we suffer being undermined, deceived, or defrauded. Rose gardens exist near major parliament buildings and government offices. Rose-shaped windows are a common motif. (Downing Street) The term Sion, or Zion, can be found in the Book of Samuel. It was the city adopted as a capitol by King David, of the House of Judah. However the name David has been found to refer to the kings of the Egyptian Eighteenth Dynasty, that is to the Cult of Aton. (See Moustapha Gadalla). The word david, gives us dove. The dove is a major cryptic device used to symbolize the House of David, and the Cultof Aton. In Latin dove is coloumbe, giving us the Knights of Columbus, the District of Columbia, Christopher Columbus, CBS, and so on. The dove can also be seen on the royal standards of the British Royal Family, on Greenpeace, and on the VISA credit cards. Now, astoundingly, but fortunately for us, the prime movers and their henchmen often openly betray their intentions, and the very nature of their designs, for the furtherance of a New World Order, for the rebuilding of the third Temple (of Sol / Aton), and for a return of their Luciferian Sun-King, etc,. A French-Jewish nobleman Hugues de Payens, together with eight other crusaders of Jewish origin, including Andre de Montbard, Geoffroi Bisol, and Geoffroi de Saint-Omer officially founded the Order of the Knights Templar in 1118. There is, however, certain information that the order was actually founded four years earlier...In 1114, the bishop of Chartres mentioned “La Milice du Christ: in a letter, the name by which the order was originally known...Hugues de Payens became the first grand master of the order...There were eleven original members and they called themselves the “Poor Knights of Solomon’s Temple,” where they were first based...A secret Jewish order was behind these men, the Order of Zion.

The fact that the central symbolism of Masonry involves the Temple of Solomon, should have alerted us to this fact long ago. Now, it happens that Freemasons, who refer to themselves as \"Sons of the Sun\" ( Phre-Massen ), are distinguished by the symbols that they commonly use on their lodges and on their literature. And it is via a study of their symbolism that we can decode their true function and agenda. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (31 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The three symbols which they universally employ are the Compass, the Square and the letter G. Many are the interpretations as to what these symbols mean and as to where they actually originate. A close reading of Masonic documents reveals a plethora of information and disinformation regarding the origin and significance of these three symbols. Space does not permit a thorough analysis presently. However, it is important to bring out something concerning the letter \"G,\" which is a great Masonic sigil (secret sign). Scholars have concluded that it refers to God, to Geometry, to Gaia, to Generation (sex), to the Hunab Ku of the Maya Shamans, to Geb the ancient Egyptian god of the phallus and the Earth, and to the sacred Spiral, etc,. Naturally, due to the synthetic and ambivalent quality of symbols, all these interpretations might be said to be true. Symbols have endless permutations. Each of these interpretations can be accepted, and each can also be refuted after separate but plausible argument and critique. It is from a close reading of Masonic and Levitical symbolism that an important clue as to the letter's actual occult origin is yielded, one that gives greater credence to our present thesis. Masonic Compass, Square, and \"G\" with the crowning Eye of Aton After the massacres and devastation by Vespasian's Roman forces in Jerusalem, the Levite echelon moved on to Jamnia and Usha, in Babylon, and formed their Talmudic Academies which lasted for centuries. It was there that they collated all the esoteric knowledge that they had acquired from Egypt. And it was there that they honed their plans for world domination. At this time the dispersed lower-class Judahites of the world knew to look to Babylon, to Jamnia, Usha, Sura, and Pumbedita, and to the Talmudic Academies, for their guidance and learning. Now, interestingly, the head potentates of these ancient academies, the elites of Talmudic scholarship, were known as the \"Gaonim.\" These Gaonim were considered princes of sacred knowledge and, as such, they commanded the greatest reverence imaginable. It is, therefore, our opinion that these Levitical Gaonim, resident in Babylon, were the descendants of the even more ancient Cult of Aton. And, furthermore, it is our contention that the Masonic letter or cipher \"G\" stands for these self-proclaimed Exilarchs, these Princes - the GAONIM, of the Babylonian GAONATE. In short, we do not think that it is far-fetched to suppose that the Compass and Square might refer to the builder's guilds and the skill of physical masonry which constructed the Temple of Sol-Aton; and to likewise suppose the \"G\" to be the arcane sign of the Priest-King cabal, and their god, who were worshipped in it. Though the knowledge of such temple construction may have rested for a time in Palestine and later Babylon it should be obvious, to even a layperson, that it originated in Egypt. Four Faces, One Head The most beloved symbol to Freemasons, and those who control this order, is the Egyptian Pyramid. They prefer the pyramid with thirteen levels, and a detached two-dimensional capstone and \"all-seeing\" eye, for the reasons mentioned above. But let us not forget that any true pyramid has four sides or faces. A pyramid is made from four triangles. Many mysteries are concealed in this design. But the power-elite at the summit know the reason for the four faces. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (32 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Basically, their secret control operates downward through the thirteen levels, yes. But it also first fans out in the four main directions symbolized by the four identical faces of the power-pyramid. That is, it operates simultaneously via four separate or sub-pyramids. After all, a pyramid would not exist without its four sides reaching upward to become the apex. So, in practice, the power of the supreme Sun Order, the Cult of Aton, is invested in four connected, but self-governing divisions or executors. If one contingent should fail, or be uncovered and thwarted, the agenda continues unmolested via the other three agents. These four \"faces\" are Judeo-Christianity (and the other orthodox religions), the military, the various scientific, educational and media institutions of the world, and the Banks. Each division, or face, has its own apex (controlling officers) who organize and govern the lower levels of its \"face.\" However, these privileged lieutenants answer to the supreme invisible \"Generals,\" above them. The Masonic and educational fraternities are designed upon the cell-structure to facilitate this occult control, and to ensure that no one part within the hierarchy conceives of what is really happening around, or above it.

They have a great deal to lose should women ever be allowed to hold office or find out what the real reasons are for their persecution and marginalization down through time. In times to come, women will constitute a major rival faction, and a vital part in the overthrow of this blood-soaked hegemony. Before this can happen, however, women need to truly awaken from to their actual archetypal purpose, lay aside their socially-vetted roles, and re-initiate themselves back into their true status as Priestesses, agents of Nuith and Ma'at, daughters of Eve and Lilith, as \"fifth-columnists\" and agents provacateurs, working to heal the planet, re-instigate the true Stellar Gnosis and tend to the psychic hygiene of their wards. The first act of creation is the birth of light. Light is always and everywhere a symbol of the male principle - Erich Fromm ( Love, Sex and Matriarchy ) She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her - Proverbs 3:15-18 Unless women do return to their royal roles as healers of nature, and keepers of the true Gnosis, the Evilarchies which dominate the planet will never be defeated. Women need to expose and confront their age old enemy that has perpetrated horrendous crimes against their sex, against their forebearers, and bring them to account for their heinous deeds. The Bible alone reveals the hatred that the great Cults, and their \"god\" have towards woman, who have never been forgiven for a certain \"crime\" that they committed over 13,500 years ago. (See Atlantis) Because thou hast done this, though art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shall you eat all the days of thy life - Genesis 3:14 The appellation Satan, in Hebrew...belongs by right to the first and cruelest “Adversary” of all other Gods–Jehovah, not in the serpent which spoke only words of sympathy and wisdom - Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky The women who decide to disregard this great work, and who compliantly remain as slaves within the status quo, and who would rather continue serving nature's destroyers rather than to be queens themselves, condemn the earth and the whole human race to physical and psychic enslavement. Nature's call to her daughters has gone unheard long enough. The time has come for action . The women who once ruled on Earth, now seem content to be ruled by its destroyers - Michael Tsarion Deceived by the Light I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star - (Jesus Christ, Rev 22:16) http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (34 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The Judeo-Christian doctrine is patently a Solar doctrine, based on the adulation of light. Its heroes are Lucifers all. According to the legends and scriptures, Lucifer was the \"Son of the Morning.\" The Son of the Morning is, obviously, the Sun. It is as simple as that. Therefore, to worship the gods of light, is to be, quite literally - a Luciferian. Lucifer is, however, the deceiver, the obscurer of the \"truth.\" Well, the sun does obscure the truth. Every morning, upon its rise, it draws a veil of light across the theatre of the night sky, the original mystery school, and analogue of the inner dome of the head, the deeper recesses of the ancestral mind. The night sky was the body of the goddess, the primal mother Nuith. As the physical sunlight obscures the mysteries of the night, so the inner psychological sun - ego- consciousness - obscures the deeper mysteries of Self and Being. The dynamics of light are the same, whether it be of the physical or psychological variety. Light emanates from the sun, and the sun is very important to Judeo-Christians and most other orthodox religions (Islam, Hinduism, Bahai, Zoroastrian, etc,.) But few ask why this should be. After all, light has some very interesting properties. What light is to the outer physical world, intellect is to the inner world of consciousness - Arthur Schopenhauer In fact, light conceals more than it reveals. This is a fact which is not commonly contemplated. \"God is Light\" and \"In the beginning was the light,\" are the mantras we constantly hear and read from Judeo- Christian sources. We need to realize what is implied by these high-sounding postulations, and by the habitual conjunction of divinity with the phenomenon known as \"light.\" What is light? And what is darkness? What is the true difference between them? Why is the sun important to the Solar Cult? Why were the stars and moon more important to the members of the Stellar and Lunar Cults? Does not the sun, upon its daily rise, draw a veil of light across the theatre of the stars? Moreover, should someone shine a bright light in your eyes, are they not then hidden from your view? And are you not blinded so as not to be able to see anything? Additionally, when light is cast upon an object, is a shadow not instantly thrown? Yes, there are many things we need to comprehend about the nature and dynamics of light. It is always before our eyes, and we believe that we see all there is to see because of it. We do not think of light as a weapon, and have left ourselves open to serious violation from those Elites who expertly and surreptitiously wield their \"industrial\" magic of light. Light As Thought Not many of us realize that there are two kinds of thinking which operate simultaneously. There is thinking with the brain, and there is thinking with the mind. Mind and brain are not the same thing. The latter is basically an organic machine programmed by our worldly experiences through time. The former is an phylogenetic inheritance, and contains the thought impressions of all those men and women who have lived before us and whose myriad experiences have been recorded in the Akashic Record or, in modern parlance, in the Collective Unconscious. Thinking with the mind is really imagining, rather than thinking. Those who \"imagine\" (with the mind) can be referred to as \"right-brained,\" while those who primarily use the brain to think, the vast majority, are \"left-brained.\" The latter see the parts and not the whole, and are \"intellectual.\" The former see the whole in each part, and are \"intelligent.\" The latter are inventive, the former are creative. The brain-thinkers love physics. The mind-imaginers enjoy alchemy and art. The brain-thinkers are linear, repressed, retentive, http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (35 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com conformist and outer-directed. The mind-imaginers are mutable, iconoclastic, independent and inner-directed. According to true Mystics, Gnostics and Taoists, true wisdom cannot be attained via any kind of thinking. Neither the brain, nor the mind, can apprehend the Real as it really is. The very act of thinking alters what is thought about, as the very act of seeing changes what is seen. Truth cannot be KNOWN. ...your desire to end desire, is still a desire - Chuang Tzu (300 BC) Additionally, contrary to what we falsely believe, we do not come into this world \"innocent.\" Innocence, as William Blake knew, is merely our state of mind when we are introduced to the phenomena of the world for the first time. To the young brain everything seems new, fresh, exciting and incomprehensible. Originally, before we are taught otherwise, we do not even try to think about what happens to us, or about what we see and experience. We just experience, and it is enough to do so. As we age, however, we gain experience, and innocence eventually flees, never to return. We certainly continue to crave that newness and freshness, but fail to realize that it is our minds, our very consciousness , which needs to be new and fresh every day, and not our experiences. The mind which is split, infirm, narcissistic, toxic and/or prejudiced, can hardly be expected to function in a healthy, spontaneous manner, or to know anything as a certainty. As such a mind decays, it loses its mutability and ceases to function holistically. It continues to have experiences, and relationships, but very few which are deep or meaningful. Such a \"calcified\" mind is content to take orders, to allow others to lead it, and to seek unison with others of its own kind. It loathes independence and aloneness. It despises darkness, silence and inwardness. It despises anyone that is inward, quiet and dark. And, it does not realize that, sooner or later, it will have to inherit the very shadows it has cast, by way of its phallocentric, acquisitive, hyper-focused modalities of thought. Nicholas Copernicus displaced Mother Earth from the center of the universe and replaced her with Father Sun - Leonard Schlain ( The Alphabet Versus the Goddess ) The correlation of consciousness with masculinity culminates in the development of science, as an attempt by the masculine spirit to emancipate itself from the power of the unconscious...We call this path \"ascent\" because we experience consciousness and the world of light as being \"above\" us and unconscious and darkness \"below\" still under the spell of the primitive symbolism which associates the upright posture of the human figure with the development of the head and the rest of the \"higher\" centers of consciousness - Erich Neumann ( The Origin and Evolution of Consciousness ) ...thinking which does not start from and continue in close relation to its foundations in the physical universe must lead to falsity - Alvin Boyd Kuhn Light As Seeing Living in the world involves sensing the world. The most important sense is seeing. Through sight we receive the vast majority of our knowledge about the world, and about reality. Seeing is achieved by way of the human eye. The eye, and the act of seeing, is dependent upon light which transmits or conducts a good portion of the world's contents to the brain. Light is, as they say, knowledge. The very word phenomena (meaning the stuff of the world) comes from the Greek word phainomenon, which derives from phaos, meaning \"Light.\" Ithyphallic beams of light enter the vesica-shaped eye, and the repetition of this motion, second by second, can be justifiably likened to a sexual act. In fact, the entrance of light piercing the passive eye is experienced as a very erotic act by the human brain, which is little more than a mass of super-sensitive nerves. This subtle optical experience may be compared to a miniature orgasm, small enough to not be http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (36 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com noticed consciously, but strong enough to be very stimulating and entrancing to the subconscious part of us. Over time, the transmittance of information via the light, creates deep impressions on the brain and mind. Again, this has phallic connotations. Because of the inherent eroticism of the light, we literally become addicted to light and the thinking to which it gives birth. Thought is the original addiction, and as addicts we do not realize how strongly held and dependent we have become. As the original addiction, thought inevitably gives rise to all other addictions. The brain cannot conceive a lightless place, and hates the darkness. This is why it has decided to associate divinity with light, and why we, subsequently, adore the light and call it god. We are light-infatuated. However, what we need to comprehend is the dual nature of the light. Where light is, there too will be shadow. Similarly, where god is, there the devil will also be. This is the paradox that perplexes the exponents and adherents of Solar-based religions. God is good, but also wrathful. God is merciful, but also vengeful. God is truth, and also deceit. So it goes, and few can account for the strange ambivalence within the nature of god. We can , and will , account for it when we realize the all- important connections between God, Lucifer, light, mind and thought. In short, light does not reveal mysteries, it creates them. Any development, at any stage, that strives toward patriarchal consciousness, toward the sun, looks on the moon spirit as the spirit of regression, as the terrible mother, as a witch - Erich Neumann ( The Origin and Evolution of Consciousness ) ...monotheism does not mirror human society. Humans are first and foremost social animals. A deity who was alone, not by choice but because there were no other companions for Him, was a concept without parallel in human society. The god of the Israelites did not have a wife, a son, a daughter, or a mother - Leonard Schlain ( The Alphabet Versus the Goddess ) It is of great interest to find out that the ancients also knew these facts, and how they too habitually connected light with masculine and phallic principles. And, it is vital to understand how important these seemingly abstract metaphysical principles are to the elites (\"great lighted ones\") within the secret societies, to those worshippers of Lucifer - the Light Bearer. To successfully combat them and foil their designs, we have to be as intellectually astute as they are. We must know what they know. We must know what it is that commands their allegiance, and we must know just how fervent their allegiances are. In writings to his Illuminati and Masonic brethren, Albert Pike, reveals the esoteric connections between Lucifer, light and phallicism: In the Book of Enoch, in speaking of the fallen angels it s said: \"The name of the first is Yekun: he it as who seduced all the sons of the Holy Angel; and causing them to descend on earth, led astray the offspring of men...and the name, as Yekain, is fitly represented by a phallic column\" - Albert Pike ( The Book of Words ) Yekun becomes Jakin , which is one of the pillars at the gates of Solomon's (Aton's) Temple, and at the gates of all Masonic Lodges. These phallic altars to Lucifer can be found (as the obelisk, tower or monument, etc,,) in most civic centers in the world, and near important banks and government addresses. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (37 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The very word phallic comes from phalos, meaning \"white\" or \"bright\" and from phaos, meaning \"light.\" Albert Pike writes: By the very name, it (the phallus) was connected with the Sun. Conclusion As Rene Magritte remarked: Everything that we see obscures something else we want to see. The path of light does not lead to true \"enlightenment.\" The original Gnostics knew this, and always associated light with Lucifer - the fallen angel. Lucifer's Fall was as a lightening flash, wrote the Kabalists. Light, they believed, descended downwards through ten major centers, or Sephiroth (spheres), and came to rest in the realm known by Kabalists as \"Malkuth,\" i.e., the Physical plane. The light, or knowledge, at this low level, is so weak in magnitude and so far removed from the realm of pure spirit, that only exceptionally wise and mentally empowered individuals can comprehend reality as it really is, and see beyond the myriad illusions which infest the world and lower mind. Those devoid of psychological insight, objectivity, and moral purity cannot escape living mediocre lives riddled with contradiction. It is not difficult to recognize and define the individuals who belong to this sorry category. They are those who wish to live forever but who despise getting old. They are those who desire to know everything but who do not wish to open their minds. They are those who wish to avoid pain but who never find out why pain arises in their lives; who say they desire freedom and yet abuse it when they find it; who want the \"light\" but who deeply fear facing the dirt it will reveal in them; and who want to see reality as it is but who don't realize that doing so will first entail seeing oneself as one truly is. Those who cannot, or who will not, face reality, have no chance of changing reality - Michael Tsarion ( Atlantis, Alien Visitation & Genetic Manipulation ) Originally, it was known and taught that spirit is outside the realms of time and does not evolve to perfection. To Mystics, the concept of Becoming has no meaning. Spirit, like the Universe from which it came, are already perfect as they are. They do no \"become\" perfect through time. The ever changing entity (the human ego) that is dependant upon the movement of time, and which is a victim of the contingent, can never arrive at its illusionary goal of perfection. Every step it makes toward this mirage is but a re-affirmation of its imperfection. And the ego cannot find a way out of this paradox. Like a spider caught in its own web, it searches constantly for an answer and tries, in manifold ways, to artificially empower itself (through technology and science), hoping to rival eternal nature, whose mysterious ambient power threatens it deeply. A shadow is just the part of Her that his light can’t banish or erase - Michael Tsarion These concepts are so alien to us because we have, in our present solar-centric, pro-masculine, anthrocentric, technocratic milieu, successfully divided reality into a myriad conflicting parts, have instigated unsustainable hierarchies which bear no resemblance to the holarchic structure of nature, and have arrogantly considered ourselves, like marooned but over-zealous Robinson Crusoes, to be \"enlightened\" \"advanced,\" and \"civilized.\" Our present decadent \"civilization\" approaches its finale, while we continue to blithely believe our own lies despite all evidence to the contrary, and despite the horrors, debauchery, injustice, criminality and insanity which pervades and infects the body politic. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (38 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com ...there were no religious wars in the ancient world before monotheism - Leonard Schlain (T he Goddess Versus the Alphabet ) The rise of masculine power and of patriarchal society probably started when man began to accumulate personal, as over against communal, property and found that his personal strength and prowess could increase his personal possessions. This change in secular power coincided with the rise of sun worship under a male priesthood...Sun worship was usually introduced and established by an edict of a military dictator, as happened in Babylon and Egypt, and probably other countries as well - M. Esther Harding ( Woman's Mysteries ) Perhaps Mahatma Gandhi was right when he cynically said that civilization would be \"a good idea,\" and perhaps Konrad Lorenz was right when he humorously implied that man is merely the missing link between apes and human beings. Perhaps, in persisting with our vain ardor to repair what is not broken, and the irrational quest to \"improve\" upon perfection, we have finally lost our vision of the inherent, ambient order and beauty all around us, that is not plugged-in, wasteful or finite, and which operates flawlessly without mind, without ego, and without human consciousness. Our own inner ugliness and toxicity prevents us from looking deeply into that pristine mirror of nature to see all that we are, and all we should be. We have become nature's rotten-apples, her unwanted abortions, so to speak, who must, for the greater good, be left to perish in the great Plutonic storms that approach us and which we, due to our existential vagrancy, have summoned into being. back Empire Striking Back Man is free to choose not to be conscious, but not free to escape the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction - Ayn Rand Despite the fact that the Bible's Old and New Testaments are the concoction of the all-powerful, scheming, megalomaniacal Cult of Aton, its incoherent and fabricated \"message\" has been accepted as \"God's Word\" for several centuries by the recently literate, nonsense- preoccupied masses of humankind. To quote from new scripture - when \"Dorothy\" wakes the hell up, she will find that behind the veil and mask of this perverse Jehovah, the brooding god, hides the \"Golden Ones\" of old, turning the world-system like a rubix-cube in whatever direction takes their maniacal fancy, cracking the whips on the herd to move them hither and thither, and slowly lasering through the very boughs of the greater Tree of Life, upon which all things, including they themselves, rest and grow. http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (39 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The unfortunate over-worked, apathetic and brain-washed masses have neither the time, energy nor inclination to discover for themselves whether there is a shred of truth in all the myriad high-sounding fables of the Bible. As the great Astro-Theologist of the nineteenth century, Rev. Robert Taylor, wrote: Men have been trained to prefer ignorance to learning, and have chosen to be driven mad and wild by faith, rather than to be instructed, enlightened and improved by reason and philosophy. To restate the headlines - it is asserted by the adherents of Judeo-Christianity that the so-called \"ten tribes of Israel\" moved westward after the so-called \"Captivity\" in Babylon, became the \"Caucasians\" and are God's \"Chosen People,\" charged with establishing the \"New Covenant\" of their jealous God in the west, specifically in America and Britain, which are, according to scripture, considered to be the \"New Israel.\" This preposterous nonsense, spouted and screamed from the pulpits, and from the rabid mouths of British-Israelites arose because of a deliberately erroneous interpretation concerning Genesis Chapter 48. That chapter concerns the blessing of Jacob upon his grandson's Ephraim and Manasseh. These two boys are the sons of Jacob's (renamed Israel) favorite son Joseph and were, suggestively, born in Egypt while Joseph was \"Governor\" there. The boys are blessed and Joseph is informed that they will go on to found the great \"Israelite\" nations of the future. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near unto him. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn...And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head...And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he shall become a people, and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations – (Genesis 48) The brain-washed, or maliciously deceptive, leaders of the world, eager to imagine themselves Jehovah's \"chosen\" elect, the descendents of the House of Israel (or David), go along with this mis-interpretation which holds the promise of total world power and dominion. This is the \"New Covenant\" that they serve, wave in front of their subjects, and which has brought the world to ruin. They preach this from on high, and fund the various maniacal evangelist scholars to find and/or supply the supporting \"evidence\" for this passage and its alleged significance. However, since both this passage and the Bible in which it is found are both elaborate concoctions of the age-old scheming Cult of Aton and their scions, our chances of finding this evidence are, like our chance of finding sense in it, minimal at best. As we have attempted to demonstrate, the Bible was created as a manifesto for world domination by the super Cult of Aton, and its Masonic, Illuminist scions. There is a further important point to bring out regarding this strange passage. It concerns the secret societies and the symbolism that they employ, and where that symbolism comes from. One of the most powerful secret societies which orchestrates world events, is known as the \"Order of the Skull and Bones.\" It is also known as the \"Brotherhood of Death.\" The symbol of this order is a death's head skull and two http://taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (40 of 44)11/03/2005 13:52:48"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com crossed arm bones, and the number 322, which connotes the spring equinox and the sign of Aries (Mars). This is the same peculiar symbol which has been used by the Pirates, the British troops, and by the Nazis. It is also a prominent Knights Templar emblem. Obviously, there are many speculations as to where this strange and sinister motif originated. It is our belief that it has its origins in Genesis Chapter 48, and in the blessing of the two brothers, Ephraim and Manasseh, the seed of the nations. The fact that they never physically existed is of no consequence to those who have benefited and profited from the lie, nor to the secret societies whose bizarre legends and rites have repeatedly been the template for political and social intrigue. Joseph brought the sons to Jacob that he might bless them, and bestow the birthright on the eldest son. Aware of Jacob’s poor vision, he was careful to place Manasseh, the eldest son, in position to receive Jacob’s right hand on his head. The birthright was given placing the right hand on the head of the one receiving the birthright. But in spite of Joseph’s careful positioning of Manasseh, so that he would receive the birthright, Jacob stretched out his hands, and crossed them and placed his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh. Thus the birthright was given to Ephraim, the youngest son - (From: Tracing the Ancestors of Great Britain and America, by the Gospel of Kingdom Ministry) Now, given that today's world leaders believe this phantasm of the \"New Covenant\" to be true we are afforded a great insight into the motives for the present belligerence of the US and British governments, and for the zeal with which they move to instigate their precious, but perfidious, \"New World Order\" leviathan. As to whether the ordinary man in the street will benefit from such a draconian \"order\" we can turn to the past words of those who deemed themselves agents of the \"Most High\" for instruction. Fortunately, from the earliest ages, these Luciferian potentates and princes have made sure to let us know of their contempt of us, and of the retribution that they will take against any form of rivalry, physical or philosophical, to their assumed suzerainty: The state of monarchy is the most supreme thing upon earth, for kings are not only God's lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon god's throne, but even by God himself are called gods...for if you will consider the attributes to God, you shall see how they agree in the person of a king...to dispute what God does is blasphemy...so it is sedition in subjects to dispute what a king may do in the height of his power. I would not have you meddle with such ancient rights of mine as I have received from my predecessors - James Stuart VI (king of Scotland and England) God omnipotent, is mustering in his clouds on our behalf, armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot, that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown...You wretches, detestable on land or sea, you will seek equality with lords and are unworthy to live.

For as long as we live we will strive to suppress you and your misery will be an example for posterity. However, we will spare your lives if you remain faithful, choose now which course you want to follow - Richard II (Fourteenth Century Plantagenet King of England) As the humble, sinning \"subjects\" of such kindly kings and gods, we cannot help but be moved to grateful tears to be recipient of such beneficent regard. In short, our masters let us know clearly and distinctly how the guarantee of our security and prosperity stands in direct proportion to our offerings of servility, obedience and labor.

We do not need the philosophers or sages to remind us of the consequences to human freedom should occult knowledge and religious obsession become fused together and used as weapons against us. Neither reason nor sense will serve to quell the obsessive zeal of these ministers of the New World Empire. The conventional intellectuals and historians who are \"educated' within the system, can write all the pro/con articles and books they want to, and can pontificate loudly or quietly 'till their heart's content. However, their words are, for the most part, mere commentaries and rarely go to the soul of the issue and problem. Moreover, the propaganda of the Empire builders, expertly drip-fed to us down through the centuries, has always proved more than successful to veto the remonstrations and warnings of their various detractors and critics. Yes, by \"Cross or by Crown,\" or by \"Hook or by Crook,\" they are determined to get their way. Manasseh would become a great nation. The greatest nation in the history of the world is the United States of America. This Joseph-nation has always been ready to come to the aid of any nation, when they need help. This is the nation that has spread the word of God throughout the world, as the prophets foretold they would, in the latter days - (From: Tracing the Ancestors of Great Britain and America, by the Gospel of Kingdom Ministry) As the savants have declared, what the Imperialists first do abroad to supposed enemies they will soon do at home to their own subjects. America and Great Britain were indeed meant to be the New Empire of Yahweh. The Temple of Sol-Aton was meant to be rebuilt for the third time. The New Jerusalem is meant to be re- established in the world. The Arab and Gentile infidels are meant to be ground into the dust, humiliated and destroyed, and the \"sinner's\" are meant to be cast into the hell of hells. There is to be eternal war.

Oft as they kindle a beacon fire for war, shall God quench it. And their aim will be to abet disorder on the earth, but God shall loveth not the abettors of disorder - The Quran (on the Levites and Zionists) Yes, the unenviable task of revealing the origins, evolution and agendas of this greatest of mind-control programs, Judeo-Christianity, may be justifiably considered futile in the extreme.
