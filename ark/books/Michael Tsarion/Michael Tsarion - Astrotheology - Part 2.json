INTRODUCTION ...perhaps there is a pattern set up in the heavens for one who desires to see it, and having seen it, to find one in himself - Plato All things that come into being have a reason for their existence, although intellectual lethargy, together with the passage of time, are the reasons why some things are accepted as fact when they are not. We dwell in times were the ego of man, and not the spirit of man, is adored and reinforced. We should allow for all that is said to be sacred to be in an adulterated and atrophied state. Sincere and close observation shows that this is indeed the case with the arcane canon, with the great Hermetic Arts of Divination: Tarot, Astrology, Kabala and Numerology. When I took up a serious study of the Tarot it was there that I found the secrets to the real Archetypal Astrology. The high Arts of Divination have each suffered from flagrant tampering, manipulation and unsustainable interpretation, from those wishing http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (2 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com to, as the sun they worship does, conceal greater secrets. Moreover, in today's overly dislocated world of academia, the Divination Arts are almost never taught as one subject as they always were in the past. Nevertheless, as I discovered, it seems that the Universal Will (Intelligence) is always in operation. In my studies I found that what was taken from or lost to one Art would be preserved and traceable in its cousin. That which was expunged or lost to Numerology I found still intact in, say, the Kabala. What was lost to Kabala I could resurrect from the study of Tarot and so on. So, like an archaeologist, only in the realm of the esoteric, I learned how to \"dust off\" these relics, so to speak, and piece them back together again. I did this with no prerequisite or pet theory, and no partisan conviction or bias. I knew not what shape the final edifice would assume. Little did I realize that my task would take me back through time to see the travesty that time and man have played on all these mystic creations of our forefathers. We may fairly agree that the subject of history, as commonly taught, is one of the most boring of all subjects. However, the study of how the subject of history has been manipulated, is surely one of the most interesting of all subjects - Michael Tsarion Today, due to the pitiful condition of the Earth and the human psyche, the Human Race looks forward to nihilism and calamity. Due to our compulsive fixation on the future, we now prefer to live in ignorance of the sublime bequeathments of the Diviners and Magi of old, and care little to nothing for their many sacrifices and dedication, their observation of the Alchemical nature of nature. Voltaire remarked that man will cease to commit atrocities when he ceases to believe absurdities. Our age, more than any other it seems, has a penchant for exoteric absurdities. In my researches there was always much darkness much that did not make sense. There were leads that initially threw little light but, when added one to another, served to spark my curiosity in ways that no orthodox subject ever had. When studying the Tarot I especially had some questions. Mere aesthetic and artistic knowledge did not serve to explicate the enigmatic symbols and most of what the books had to say often seemed contradictory and perfunctory. So I followed the wisdom of Vernon Howard who wrote: see human nonsense as nonsense http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (3 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com and save spending years making sense of it. The medieval packs are hopelessly corrupt...or otherwise far from presenting the Ancient Truth of the Book in a coherent system or shape of lucid beauty - Aleister Crowley ( Book of Thoth ) THE INFLUENCE OF JORDAN MAXWELL There are thousands hacking at the branches of evil, to the one who strikes at the root - Henry David Thoreau Many have heard of Astrology and Astronomy. But few there are in the west today that have heard of their parent subject - Astro- Theology. We insist that this is not by chance. Many there are that teach metaphysical subjects but few that can completely lay bear the occult roots of religion and politics. In short, we as individuals instead of constantly looking powerlessly forward to hypothetical futures for our truths must begin revisiting the roots of culture, religion and government. In today's society we are always searching for excellence and perfection. We speak about the prestige of being \"original\" and we admire those who are. But the word original connotes origins, which connotes the ability to - go back to the roots. It was in the earliest days of my researches, in Ireland, that I came across the voluminous work of Jordan Maxwell, a researcher into the ancient cults. Since the 1950s he has been diligently reconstructing the Gnosis of the Stellar and Solar epochs, and has found that these Cults are far from being relics of the past. The puzzles and conundrums that had troubled me for years slowly became lucid, after my introduction to the work of Jordan Maxwell. So was proved to me the truth - If your search is very diligent, then one day you will meet a teacher that will not deceive you. Without the work of Mr. Maxwell I am convinced that I would still be very much in the dark concerning the finer details of the great story, and would certainly never have made the profound discoveries concerning the Divination Arts that has been my good fortune.

For more information on the life and mission of Jordan Maxwell, visit his website at www.jordanmaxwell.com TAROT AND ASTRO-THEOLOGY There has been much speculation and debate about the origin of the idiosyncratic imagery of the Tarot's 78 Atus (cards). Where do the images originate and what do they represent? Some have said that the layout tells a certain story. Actually, I believe and advocate, that we cannot hope to come to complete understanding about the Tarot until we experience Life, Being and Cosmos, the way the ancient Egyptians and Mediterranean peoples did. The way they perceived nature, the Universe and the mystery of Being is encapsulated in the Tarot. As Plotinus wrote: The Egyptians, either by exact science or spontaneously, had arrived at a method by means of which they could rite with distinct picture of material objects, instead of ordinary letters expressing sounds and phrases. These pictures were not ordinary images of the things they represented but were endowed with certain symbolic qualities (Sophia), by means of which they revealed to the initiated contemplator a profound insight into the very essence of substances of things, and an intuitive understanding of their transcendental origins, an insight which was not the result of reasoning or mental reflection, but was acquired spontaneously by means of divine inspiration and illumination. As artistic representations of this phenomenal world, they revealed, in fact, the ideal world of the soul. The Tarot contains the wealth of their experience about every aspect of life, microcosmically and macrocosmically.

But they are not only of the physical world, but are symbolic representations of the mythic and archetypal dimensions. They allow us to transcend the hylic (base/ stereotypic) level and rise to the transluminal (symbolic/ archetypal) level of cognition. Tarot cards, like an astrological chart, collectively and individually, represent composite symbolic descriptions of the microcosmic and macrocosmic dimensions. They also depict the dynamics and changes which arise from our interaction with our inner and outer environments. The Divination Arts remind us that our inner world is not separate from the so- called \"outer\" world. They remind us that psychic energy and physical energy are the same thing, seen from two different vantage points. They remind us that ego and self are not the same thing, that doing and being are not the same thing, and that life and lifestyle are not the same thing. Man changes his environment which, in turn, changes him. Man is a part of, and apart from, the world. The glass of water which we drink is forever changed by that act. But we too are changed forever by that same simple act. The ego sees the action of mind over matter as the magic. That is the so-called fact which inspires science. However, the truth is that the real magic is how the mind is affected by matter, by nature, and by the magical and mysterious process we call \"life.\" True symbolism depends on the fact that things, which may differ from one another in time, space, material nature, and many other limitative characteristics, can possess and exhibit the same essential quality - Titus Burckhardt ( Alchemy ) Astrological Inaccuracy and Fallacy No ancient astrologer or diviner believed, as the exoteric astrologers do now, that rocks floating in distant parts of space, affect consciousness. Nothing of this kind was taught, and nothing could be further from the actual truth. If the planet Mars exploded tomorrow, it does not mean that the human proclivities, represented by Mars, will disappear from consciousness. As my Taroscopic System ™ advocates, the zodiac is within . I refer to it as the \"Living Oracle.\" The external planets have no strange effect on consciousness, at least not enough to affect one's fate. It is a fundamental error and the basis of great metaphysical confusion to postulate otherwise.

It was these arts that they were after in the first place, and that they wanted to appropriate and suppress. Therefore, if we still find the divination arts in existence, which we do, it goes without saying that they cannot be in their original, uncontaminated form. They must be distortions, and do betray this fact not only by being disconnected from one another, but from frequently yielding erroneous advice. The elites within Judeo-Christianity knew that mere suppression of these arts was not going to work. Suppression would force the practice underground, for the great arts were far too ingrained into the minds and hearts of the ordinary people of the ancient world. Better, then, to gradually tweak them, warp them, and eviscerate them, so they may appear to exist and work, when in fact they work only imperfectly. The high arts of Divination now suffer from being disconnected from one another, and from being studied, taught, used and researched as separate divided subjects. This travesty alone betrays a malign influence. Few scholars in recent times have correctly researched the particular vision, and teachings, of the ancestors. We, therefore, encourage the reader to peruse the works of Jordan Maxwell, Gerald Massey and the other scholars mentioned above, to come into some legitimate understanding of how the mighty Egyptian Siderealists saw the mysteries of Life, Being and the Universe, for unless we get back to that vision we as a species are doomed to utter destruction. And no amount of \"isms\" and \"ologies\" will ever prevent it. Ultimately, the student must eventually begin sincerely researching Astro-Theology, the subject of subjects. Astro- Theology, the \"Religion of the Stars,\" is also called siderealism, sabeanism and uranography. It is from this great subject that common astrology and astronomy derive. Any study of these cannot, in any way, be complete without comprehension of their parent: Astro-Theology. On this site we endeavor to resurrect this subject of Astro- Theology, especially in its vital connection to the Divination Arts of Astrology and Tarot.

The fact of the matter is, and should be understood by all, the Tarot is purely Egyptian in origin. ...according to the ancient Greek philosopher Iamblichus, a series of 22 frescoes identical to the Tarot Major Arcana once adorned the walls of a secret underground gallery accessed through labyrinthine passages. Priests wishing to be indoctrinated into the meaning of these frescoes entered the subterranean passage through a door in the breast of the Great Sphinx. The novice priest would then repeatedly encounter the sphinx motif within this secret gallery. The frescoes lining each wall were said to be flanked by sphinx- like caryatids, 24 in all, and to be lit by 11 crystal oil lamps shaped n the form of sphinxes. A sphinx was also prominently displayed in Fresco 10 (Arcanum 10 of the Tarot), the last fresco in the sequence 0 through 10 which together depicted the science of creation...Also, Arcanum 21 (the final pictogram in the series) depicted the four zodiac signs of the sphinx distributed symmetrically around a large wreath.

Each Cult, until the point when they joined together, absorbed the mythologies and beliefs of those antecedent. All used astrology but each Cult made changes to the lexicon of the past, to the canon of the Gnosis regarding this subject of subjects. We are inheritors of all these contentions and alterations. And from our pedestal, looking back through the generations, we have anything but a true perspective. The lives and beliefs of our earliest predecessors are especially obscured by time and obsolescence. Moreover, our perspective has been consciously distorted by malign influences within the post-Industrial cabals of learning, by those at the helm of the faculties of history, anthropology, mythology, and religion, etc,. The Great Cabal The great Cults finally decided to unite their forces and, instead of being in constant competition for the minds of men, to make it all so much easier for themselves by consolidating resources and agendas. This event of monumental importance, this forming of the world's first corporation, occurred in the area today referred to as \"Israel.\" Though the traditional histories avoid this fact, it is spoken of allegorically, in the Bible and in other tales and fictions. In fact, it is the reason why Israel has its very name. Israel, is made up of the names of the three deities the ancient Cults: Isis, http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (12 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Ra and El (Moon, Sun and Saturn). The history of astrology, myth and religion, as well as the theories advanced here, cannot be fully understood without a deep study of these cults. Israel is the \"Holy Land\" and the locale from which, what we know as Judeo-Christianity, arose. We cannot understand much about this until we approach it from the background of Astro-Theology and the great cults. What good is a surgeon who does not know where the heart is? What good is a historian who does not understand the heart of religion, government and culture? Infernal Pacts The coming together of the Cults did not happen overnight. It was a long and tedious process. The major denominations, like those of today, were no lovers of each other. It was financial and material incentives which motivated them to combine their resources and intentions. Trade routes, power over the minds of men, and domination of the earth, was all for the taking, and it was too much to resist. Moreover, each Cult's hierarchy feared that the other Cults may unite against them. So, because of this fear, and because of insatiable greed, each Cult agreed that confederation was expedient. From the time of their infernal pact, they realized that all that was needed for total dominion over minds and lands, was the ability to convincingly wave \"God\" in people's faces. From that point onward the rest would be easy. The leaders of the seven great Cults of power (Seven Churches), decided that rather than fighting amongst themselves for supremacy over the ancient world, the should combine forces. Each Cult feared that they could be deposed if the others conspired in concert against it. This conjunction of Cults did not happen immediately or quickly. It took several centuries. The Old Testament contains the story of this coming together. The elite dynasties of these Cults operate, through their descendants, in this world today, and are extremely powerful - Jordan Maxwell (From: Secret Societies and Toxic Religion ) The Empire (Rome) gradually absorbed and adapted to its own ends the multitude of cults derived from all its parts and over the ensuing centuries coupled them together as one, the Roman universal church. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (13 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Today, it is called the Roman Catholic church.

And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.

Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel...And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it - Jeremiah 18 A Matter of Time Time itself was divided to reflect and commemorate the unification of the Cults. The year round was broken down into 12 months to honor the Solar Cult. Their god was the sun and his number was 12. The next division of time was a month and, as the word's etymology indicates, this was sacred to the Lunar Cult, whose chief tutelary deity was the moon. The next division of time is a week, in which the 7 gods of the Stellar Cult are honored. These are today's days of the week. The worshippers of the god Saturn was given Saturday as a feast day, and since their god (planet) moves so gradually, the larger, longer cycles of time where attributed to him. The hands of a physical timepiece have, for generations, concealed and revealed this sectioning of time according to the Cults. The hour hand represents Horus, the sun. The minute hand stands for Min, the moon-god. The fast moving second hand stands for Mercury, the god of the Stellar Cult, as do the 12 divisions. On elaborately designed watches and clocks, the hands often display circles upon them, to illustrate that they represent planetary obs. Flags contain stars, moons, and solar orbs.

The first of the great cults was the Sidereal or the Stellar. Their totem symbol was, and still is, the serpent and/or the pentagram or star. It is they who discovered the mysteries of the stars. They were the high mathematicians and geometrists, and it was they who fashioned and employed the Divination Arts. It is to these Siderealists that we owe almost all the knowledge of reality that we possess. Their findings and subsequent creations in writing or stone are the foundation on which all historical ages and our time rest (should anyone doubt this, they should spend some time merely visiting the great capitol cities of the west and observing the design and layout of them all). For the advent of the phallocratic, hierarchical, masculine and monotheistic (Solar) religions to take hold, and rise to dominance, it was essential that the Stellar, and Lunar Cults of Egypt, India, Ireland and the world, be systematically undermined and eventually eradicated. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (15 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The Egyptians had no vicarious atonement, no imputed righteousness, no second-hand salvation.

The entire dimensions of the Great Pyramid at Giza are, for instance, encapsulated within the 52 cards of the ordinary playing deck. Most of our nursery rhymes also originate with this Cult. They all contain profound esoteric secrets. The Role of Women During the tenure of the Stellar Cults women held superior positions in society, religion and government. It was the periodicity of the female gestation cycles that initially awakened humans to the inherent order of the universe outside them, and that drew their attention to the night sky which has always, henceforth, been regarded as the \"body\" of the goddess. The perceived order of the universe was, hitherto, always styled and worshipped as a female mother goddess. This goddess was known, by various names, depending upon the Cult and the correlations. She was known as Taurt (Tarot), Nuit, Nun, Ma'at, Isis, Hathor, Sophia, and Mara or Mary. The epithet Ma'at (Mahat, Mayat, Maht, etc,) is the root of the very words matter, material, mate, mathematics and measure.

When woman are, and the feminine principle is, kept in a fallen state the masculine \"Yang\" modality and mentality which is so spirit denying and destructive can easily be insinuated into consciousness and culture. Our own times bear sufficient testimony to this differentiation. Males immortal live, renewed by female deaths - William Blake The history of civilization appears to be a sorry, one- sided history of domination by man...almost invariably the basic cultural pattern has been the work of man. Whole areas of history are darkened by the ignorance of man of the truth that they can create only through the feminine in their own natures just as they procreate in the world without through the woman alone - Laurens van der Post ( Jung and the Story of Our Times ) When we look back across the historical time of patriarchy...there seems to be some terrible inevitability, a relentless desire to crush the female essence, human and divine. The question of why is one of the most puzzling of our time - Leonard Schlain ( The Alphabet Versus the Goddess ) Many of the ancient peoples were Siderealists, the early Semites, Indo-Aryans, the Chaldeans, Teutons and Celts, etc,. The Semitic and Roman calendars began at sunset. The Druids and the Shamans of the Maya also arose at night and marked time primarily from the passages and phases of Venus and the Moon. The Siderealists had complete knowledge of the measurements of the earth and the neighboring planets were charted by them. They http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (17 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com were the fathers of astronomy. They are the original Magi spoken of in the religious tomes and the one we know as the Christ and other figures such as Merlin, Abaris, Pythagoras, Apollonius, Ovid, Virgil, Valentinus, Basilides (and many among the ranks of the persecuted), were scions of the Sidereal Cult. Christ even remonstrates to his disciples \"Be ye as wise as Serpents.\" This doesn’t make much sense until we discover that the serpent was the prime symbol of the Stellar Cult, the \"wise-ones\" of old. The Solar Cult Ernest Busenbark reminds us that it was about 3,000 years ago, in the Age of Taurus that the Solar Cults began gaining power. He writes: ... sun worship does not appear to have existed as a distinct and separate system, but was simply grafted on the older cult; and after the two became fused, the sun eventually became the dominant figure. Solar-Theology: Paradigm and Politics The rise of masculine power and of patriarchal society probably started when man began to accumulate personal, as over against communal, property and found that his personal strength and prowess could increase his personal possessions. This change in secular power coincided with the rise of sun worship under a male priesthood...Sun worship was usually introduced and established by an edict of a military dictator, as happened in Babylon and Egypt, and probably other countries as well - M. Esther Harding ( Woman's Mysteries ) Any development, at any stage, that strives toward patriarchal consciousness, toward the sun, looks on the moon spirit as the spirit of regression, as the terrible mother, as a witch - Erich Neumann ( The Origin and Evolution of Consciousness ) Nicholas Copernicus displaced Mother Earth from the center of the universe and replaced her with Father Sun - Leonard Schlain ( The Alphabet Versus the Goddess ) http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (18 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The politics of the Solar Cult in regards the previous Cults was somewhat the same as that of the Protestant religion toward its antecedents. The rituals of the former were abandoned and no heed paid to the knowledge that had been amassed. The focus of worship was moved from the pantheistic and esoteric outlook to the monotheistic and exoteric. Instead of the night sky and the constellations, it was the day and the lone sun which became the symbol for deity. All future world religions would bear antique motifs, but worship would fixate on a homogenous source-point. When we read or hear about the coming of \"Christianity\" we are really hearing the history of this change of philosophical and theocratic paradigm, which explains why there are so many seemingly fantastic and inexplicable events occurring around the personality of Christ. These have been put in front of us as legitimate biographical anecdotes which must be accepted on faith or as \"miracles\" which can never be rationally explained. When baby Jesus is being \"born\" in Bethlehem, he and his parents are visited by three \"wise men\" bearing gifts. Into the stable come three kings with three symbolic gifts. The nature of the gifts and the number of visitors alerts the student to the hidden implication of the Nativity story. Not only do the three Magi represent the three great cults (other than the Solar), the symbols they bear indicate that they are paying supplication to the Solar King, the new power \"in town,\" so to speak. Frankincense, is amber-like in its natural resinous form. It was burned in the temples of the sun. Likewise Myrrh, is resinous, and both are sacred to the sun, occasionally being called the tears of the sun. And gold, obviously, represents the sun. In fact, it is one of the sun's major symbols. The Nativity is a propaganda story for the Solar Cult. In it the three other Cults bow and even pay tribute to the new Cult which is to dominate them, and the world. Christ then, like the Pope now, is only a symbol for the sun. On an existential and psychological level the sun and the Solar relates to the left-hemisphere of consciousness and to the kind of thinking which is exemplified by Physics. The so-called \"right- brain\" equivocates with the moon and the stars. The right brain's activity gives rise to imagination and intuitive thought. Physics sees the part of the parts, whereas Alchemy deals with the whole within each part. The former relies on linear mathematics and pulls one’s attention into the realm of physical empirical \"reality\" http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (19 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com divorced from man's inner universe. It is also patently hierarchic and exclusionary, masculine and autocratic, unlike the more antique world-view which emphasizes the mutuality and inherent kinship of all life, sentient or otherwise. The edicts of the Siderealists is somewhat preserved in today’s pagan traditions who declare: Live simply that others may simply live . Pity that this seems so complicated to do for most people. ...monotheism does not mirror human society. Humans are first and foremost social animals. A deity who was alone, not by choice but because there were no other companions for Him, was a concept without parallel in human society. The god of the Israelites did not have a wife, a son, a daughter, or a mother - Leonard Schlain ( The Alphabet Versus the Goddess ) Proto-astrology was not, as it is now, premised upon a Solar- Theology since the sun on its annual rotation physically and symbolically equates with ephemerality and wane, with time and evolution through time. This is diametrically opposed to the mysticism of the Sidereal ethos. As the sun literally drew a veil of light across the body of the mysteries (the night sky and the stars) so the ego (our \"inner sun\" so to speak) draws a \"veil\" over our true inner essence and source. We have little idea what this means today because we have been indoctrinated, even intimidated, by thousands of years of Judeo-Christianity and the orthodox hegemonies of those aligned and obsessed with the solar milieu. Women, nature, quietitude and darkness are equated with evil. Lifestyle and human motivation become expressions of aggression, acquisition and conquest over other entities. Whether direct, canalized or sublimated, this acquisitive, graduating movement of a personal and collective ego, is circumscribed by periodicity and time. Its signature is rise and fall, wax and wane. The stars were however the image of all that is eternal, everlasting, complimentary and mutual. The movement of the sun was far less important to the Siderealists than it became to later cults. Upon its rise, the entire night sky with all its mystery and revelation was extinguished, the stars could not be observed and life became external and industrial. Thus it was that the sun was considered under the sidereal ethos as Lucifer, literally the \"Son of the Morning.\" He, Lucifer, obscured the truth and the goddess. It is a truism of the Siderealists that those who worship the sun are \"Luciferians\" in the truest sense of the word. Among the many http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (20 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com symbols used, the sun is often represented by the \"All Seeing Eye\" of the god of light. Those who worship this god, those in power today, call themselves the \"Illumined Ones.\" Within their enclaves they know themselves as \"Luciferians\" as can be seen by those that have taken the time to read their various manifestos. (See Albert Pike's Morals and Dogma ). The greatest manifesto being the Old Testament: The first act of creation is the birth of light. Light is always and everywhere a symbol of the male principle - Erich Fromm ( Love, Sex and Matriarchy ) Originally, it was known and taught that spirit is outside the realms of time and does not evolve to perfection, for to perfection the concept of Becoming has no meaning. Spirit, like the Universe from which it came are already perfect as they are. The ever changing entity that is dependant on the movement of time, a victim of the contingent, can never commune with these. The reason that this is so alien to the religious and philosophical sensibilities of modernity is due to the legacy of living in a solar- centric, masculine-polarized era that sets the universe into dialectical opposites, warring factions and then brazenly posits the reason for all of this as being the final triumphant \"illumination\" of mankind. All along the way to this orgasmic rapture we find destruction, debauchery, monumental arrogance, megalomania and mesmerizing corruption. The one thing that seems to continually elude these tyrannies is human freedom. Is this the legacy left to us by the masters and Magi of old? For more information on Astro-Theology go to the links page Two Kinds of Magick http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (21 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Now it happens to be a fact that the dogmatists and advocates of the Judeo-Christian belief system would have seen each of us on the gallows, in the dungeon or on the stake for practicing Theurgy or Hermetic Magick, etc,. Orthodox representatives from each of the three main exoteric religious creeds, habitually declare that belief in, or practice of, the Divination Arts is sacrilegious. Yet, when we do our homework, when we open our eyes and see behind their rhetoric, we find that these same prohibitors, these assailants on other people's life and liberty, have conferred names and titles upon themselves which clearly originate from the Stellar, Lunar, Saturnian and Solar cults of antiquity. To further understand the reasons for this and to discover how the plutocrats and religious archimandrites empower themselves, it is of great importance to realize something about the two forms of Magic - namely the \"Black\" and \"White.\" Note how neither of these terms denote a specific value judgment. Good and bad, negative and positive, are not expressed. The terms are \"White\" and \"Black.\" So what do they mean beyond their pantomime connotations? So-called \"Black Magic,\" is that which is done to one without their consent and conscious knowledge, from behind the scenes, so to speak. \"White Magic\" is that which is done in full view and usually with one's consent on some level. Though it may sound strange, Black Magic can be good magic and White Magic can be very malign. When one walks into a hospital, or court, or school or even a church, they are involved in \"White Magic\" rituals. When one watches TV, or looks at a commercial billboard or advertisement it is the same. One is on the \"White Square.\" One has had their consciousness altered or influenced but one has \"gone to them,\" as it were, with volition, energy and compliance. Black Magic is merely that which is done without one's full knowledge or approval. But it can still be for one's ultimate benefit. Today the \"White Magic\" is more deadly. And this is not all a play on words as the lazy mind may conclude. This is exactly the logic of the controllers. In the process of taking our power back from those who have cunningly appropriated it, there are many such nuances to be considered. WORDS WITH ASTRO-THEOLOGICAL ORIGINS http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (22 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com This section also introduces the subject of Etymology (the meaning of words). Etymology is one of the most important subjects to learn. History has been tampered with to the point that makes it serve the oligarchic forces that keep man in servitude. However, words change only slightly, mostly the vowels interchange whereas consonants remain very much the same for centuries. Ancient written languages like Greek, Egyptian and Hebrew did not use vowels at all. History can be distorted (using synchronic and diachronic manipulation, etc,). Words and names often preserve much vital and fascinating information about the world of the past and present. Here are some words, along with others, that are found commonly in the orthodox world but which derive directly from the \"pagan\" past and which make reference to the mystery of the stars. PASTOR Here is a word commonly used by persons in the Christian religion, in reference to someone with clerical duties. The word has two syllables, Pa and Stor . The first syllable is the root of the word for father, elder and great. The latter stands for Star . The vowels often replace one another as a word passes down and is pronounced by different cultures. The word pastor , translates as great or father star. The great star is, of course, the sun, the great star in the heavens. It may also relate to Saturn, which was the supreme 'star,' of the ancient cult of Saturn. Now in the time of the Saturnian Cult the color black was worn by the holy ones, because as astrologers know, the planet Saturn and the domicile Capricorn, are connected with the color black and the metal lead. Followers of the ancient Cult of Saturn or of EL, knew that it had rings around it. The white ring around the collar of the Pastor and the black robes that he dons, are direct references to the Cult of EL or Saturn. EL worshippers had their days and calendars begin at 12 midnight and held their convocations on the day of Saturn (Saturday), as opposed to the later Solar Cult that worshipped on the Sun’s day ( Sunday). Now the planet Saturn was worshipped because it was the planet that had the rings around it. This is where we get the image of the magician standing in a protecting circle, usually containing planetary sigils. It is why the magistrate, in a court, sits in a half circle. It is why when one comes to be married a wedding ring is worn. It is why the monks shaved their heads in a ring, why the Jews who worship on the day of Saturn, http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (23 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com wear the yarmulke and why the Pope also wears it. It is why the yogi joins his thumb and middle digit together, to signify mastery over the forces of karma and time. It is why ambassadors upon entrance to a foreign court, would draw around themselves an imaginary circle to indicate neutrality. It is why Kings wear crowns. This very word, as well as coronet, comes from corona and Kronos. Kronos is the same as Saturn. In fact the Kings would often wear the ring of authority or power due to this relation to the planet Saturn. It is the reason why women wear the earrings, as they were told to listen to their god Saturn. It is where the idea for the spiritualizing halo came from, that one sees throughout religious art. The ancient name of Saturn was, as mentioned, EL . It is the reason why those that were chosen by EL, were called Elites . In fact the words, Elect, Elder, Elevated, Elohim, Temple, Circle, Gospel, Apostle, Disciple, Evangelists , etc., all derive from the Cult of EL. Angels are messengers of god. But god was EL , which is why we have the names of the Archangels bearing the \"el,\" suffix - Raphael, Michael, Uriel, Gabriel, etc,. It is were the idea came from to ring a bell in order to summon people to worship. Many place names contain the prefix or suffix EL (see Elstree, meaning EL's Tree ). Understanding of modern religion can never be complete without a comprehension of this great cult as its symbols permeate all areas of religious and even secular life. A look at corporate logos symbols makes it clear that this cult is not at all extinct. El also gives Bel, Bael, Baal and Belial. MASTER A very familiar word given to those of intelligence and merit. But its origins are again connected with the Stellar Cult. The syllables are Ma - for measure and Stor - for Star. \"measurer of the stars,\"- namely an astrologer. Children are still given a star today for successful application to their studies. When we matriculate from a university, we are given a \"Master’s Degree.\" This is purely sabean. Degrees are part of the cycle of the zodiac. The ancients marked competence on how a person knew about celestial mathematics and the science of the heavens. The heavens are the abode of the goddess, so knowing the movements within her abode was paramount to the ancients. The operations of the heavenly bodies and familiarity with their \"great dance,\" was the vaunted knowledge. One was given a \"degree,\" to show that they, like the sun they were progeny of, had ascended to an exalted place. Once you had mastered the stars you were then quite literally a MASTER. The word Mas, in Persian meant moon, so http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (24 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com master, can mean moonstar . MINISTER Another familiar term associated with the ecclesiastical profession. However, what few realize is that this word originated in or refers to the Lunar and Stellar Cults. The word Min was the common name of the moon, in fact it is were we derive the word moon . And Ster , is really star. So when we refer to someone as a Minister, we are really saying Moon-Star . It is a title that derives from the lunar and stellar cults. This explains why there is a minute hand on a watch. The three hands of a watch relate to the three planet associated with time. The slow hand is the hour hand, meaning Horus, the sun. The minute hand is for Min, the moon and the swift ticking hand is for Mercury, the planet which rotates fastest of all, both round the sun and on its own orbit. This is why the figure of the god Mercury was depicted with wings on his shoes or feet. CARDINAL In Catholicism, we have the Pope and his Cardinals. The word is Latin for hinge. As the sun passed the great solstice and equinox points, it was said to have passed and even to have \"opened\" the doors of the Houses (astrological). The physical Pope even has rituals called the opening of the door to the year or the millennium. Pope seems to come from Pontifex meaning \"Bridge Builder\" or from Papa , meaning the \"doorway.\" The cardinal points are a direct reference to the astrological colures. The Cardinals surround the Pope as the cardinal points surround the sun. The sun casts its rays on the Houses as it passes, turning them crimson. The color worn by the physical Cardinals is red, to symbolize that they are illuminated by their proximity to the Pope, the representative of God on earth. The word Pope , may also be a derivative of the word in Egyptian for the evil serpent Apep, Apophis or Apopsa. (See Poop Deck and Pupa, and Pepsi, Pepsid, Dr. Pepper, Sgt. Pepper, etc,). PATRIARCH Means Father or great arch. Again this connotes astrological phenomena. The great arch or arc, is the passage of the sun across the northern dome of the sky. This was revered and is why there are beautiful arches in all the cities of the world. Arches symbolize the sun’s triumphant journey. A man who measured or observed this movement was titled- Patriarch . http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (25 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com ARCH BISHOP Again this refers to the great journey of the sun across the northern sky. Arches or arcs are an astrological and geometric term. And Bishop is one of the oldest words we have referring to those who knew the sky. MONARCH Comes from the Lunar Cult, where the head potentate would be called a \"moon’s arch,\" that is, bestowed sovereignty by the goddess of the Moon. MONSTER Has the words moon and star in it. The word was used to further denigrate those who would not adhere to the Solar Cults dominion. This demonization is the same as lunatic, sinner, harlot, whore, tart, prostitute and fallen woman. All these words were monikers for the members of all the previous cults, that resisted the dominion of the later cults. The word Hierodulai, , meaning sacred woman, or beloved one, is where we get harlot . And the sacred women got to be sacred because they were the priestesses of the previous cults. MONSIGNOR Another person of the Cloth. The word means, Elder-Moon , or the Great Moon . MONASTERY The name given to a place where one is interned to contemplate the divine mysteries. However, the word comes from mon (moon) and aster (stars), a place of the moon and the stars. Yet when we enter into one and ask if the monks or priests there believe in astrology, you might find that you get sprinkled with holy water. People that have made a study of stained-glass windows or church architecture will have seen many secret sabean symbols. Now our banks and fast-food eateries seem to appear subliminally like churches; porticos, towers, stained-glass and all. Not that anyone has noticed. CHURCH This finds one origin in the Greek Circe , the goddess of deception who lured men into her lair and transformed them into pigs. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (26 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Jordan Maxwell correctly points out that this is the same thing that is done by that which we call the physical Church. The difference is that the latter is done mostly with our consent. The actual origins of the word Church go back to Egypt. MAGISTRATE The Magi were the Egyptian star-gazers or astrologers. The black- robed judge or magistrate, like the priest, pastor, rabbi, missionary and scholar, is styled on the planet Saturn, always denotative of law and order, establishment and Karma. \"Old Father Time,\" that punishes for infractions of divine law. He sits three stories high and presides over the 12 lesser \"judges.\" But there is a more secret rationale behind the design of courts and the use of the number 13. The court rooms of today are analogous to the zodiac. The judge represents the 10th House or sign, Capricorn, he that puts a \"stop\" on you , calls you to account. In the Tarot the equivalent card is called The Devil . Also the number 13 is extremely important in occult ritual, though not for the reasons known to superstitious Christians and the like. It represents the Lunar year and also the 13th sign of the zodiac that is known and employed by the black deceivers. This sign called Ophiuchus, (the Serpent Bearer ), runs between Sagittarius and Capricorn. It is considered by occultists a neutral zone, actually out of the regular zodiac. The reason for this has to do with the Galactic Center, the Black Sun , the altar of the solar system, to which everything is moving. This central sun is in the 13th sign (commonly Sagittarius). It is considered a precinct of the zodiac removed from the other houses. This is why when one is in a Law Court, one has to pass by a gate and fence to face the 13th judge. This is why in many cathedrals, churches and synagogues, there is also a precinct behind the altar, leading to the holy place. It is also the reason why in civic centers and government buildings there are motifs and murals on the architecture and on the floors depicting zodiacs and large black stars. These can also be seen in Masonic Halls and on product logos. The planet Saturn can be considered a double for the black sun, as it rules Capricorn and the color black. The symbol of Saturn is perhaps the most common logo symbol used, after the sun. The swastika also went by the name of the \"Black Sun.\" There are many corporate logos that are based on it also. The number 13 turns up in the fact that many serial killers actually murder 13 victims before they are caught. One day when people are ready to hear about the real reason for these killings, they will find the answers for what has http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (27 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com been staring them in the face for decades. Many government operations, both covert and non-covert, are convened under the 13th sign, that is rituals, assassinations and inaugurals, speeches and declarations of war, etc,. SISTER Comes from the word for star and possibly the phoneme Xi (now si), meaning woman in ancient Greek. The word sissy , used as a ridicule for cowardice, comes from this. AMEN Here we have a name from the Egyptian sidereal period, their sun- god and highest divinity. Yet we have at the end of every Christian prayer the word Amen . Amen is the sun and one of the earliest Egyptian gods. THE LETTER O (Oh) As placed in front of terms like God and Lord , etc,. It signified the sun. In Christian churches the habit of raising the hands in front of one and in the shape of a V, comes from the ancient salute of the sun worshippers. HOLY Derives from the same root as halo, hallowed, hail and hello, etc,. All come from Helios, the sun. Halos were shown as a effulgent aureole around the head of a saint or elevated person. Occasionally, they represent the rings of the planet Saturn. MONEY $ Comes about due to the Cult of the Moon. All money was made of elements that symbolized divinity and the particular deities that the Cult was worshipping. The gold coinage was in honor of the sun, the silver coinage, the moon. Now the Lunar Cult preferred silver and this metal was more abundant. The heads or likenesses of the deity would be emblazoned on the very coins. Materialism was loathed and the means of exchange for commercial ventures was made to bear the visages of the gods as a reminder of the spiritual dimension, lest man should forget and get immersed in lower appetite drives. Later, kings got it into their heads, that they were gods and began putting their heads on coins and the rest is history. But the coinage and currencies got the name \"money\" from the moon as there was always much more silver coinage http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (28 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com than gold. Silver was connected with the moon and therefore with the Goddesses of the moon, the most famous of which was and is ISIS. So her name became the symbol of money. We find this today in the cleverly camouflaged motif - $- which is nothing more than the sigil for the name of I-S-I-S , but fused together in an ingenious manner. The dollar sign was originally an innocuous U. S. fused together. One must ask why it was changed, or why the dollar bill is covered in the symbols common to each of the four great cults. The Pyramid is for the Stellar Cult, as are the various stars that appear on the bill. The Golden Eagle is for the Solar Cult. The Eagle is the symbol of America because it signifies the constellation in Scorpio called Aquila. Scorpio is the sign of power, money and wealth, as well as secret knowledge. (The U.S. elections are held right n the middle of Scorpio and the birthday of America is in the Scorpionic decanate of Cancer.) The color green also relates to the Solar Cult. The number thirteen, which appears frequently on the dollar bill stands for the Lunar Cult. There are thirteen months in the Lunar Year. (America originally had thirteen States. London is made up of 28 boroughs, this being the number of the Lunar \"mansions.\") Thirteen is also a Stellar Cult numeral, much used by the Israelites and other Semitic tribes and nations. Then there are the watermarks, or \"moon letters,\" for the Lunar Cults. And the material power of money, which is supreme, in the world, relates to the Cult of Saturn. The art of money making and its design was preserved by the Huguenots, who were originally a secret society of Freemasons (see Harold Bailey's Lost Language of Symbolism, vols 1 and 2). The word mint comes from the most ancient name of the moon. Money is a purely a creation of occult societies. There is also much Jupiterian symbolism also on the dollar bill, in the quotations from Ovid and Virgil that are found around the pyramid. The Semitic nations brought their totemic and cultic symbols into Europe after their various \"captivities.\" It is thought that these tribes gained much of their symbolic knowledge from their exposure to the high cultures of Babylon and Egypt and other civilizations that are later lambasted as havens of debauchery. It should be considered interesting that in over 30,000 years of existence, Egypt never expanded its main territories or set out to conquer any other peoples or lands. All citizens had rights and there was not a single record found relating any religious intolerance. Women enjoyed freedoms and status that no later age would credit them, and there is no record of any sexual http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (29 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com criminality or abuse of women coming out of Egyptian history. MONTH This one is at least still well known as attributable to the periodicity of the moon. After the joining of the great Cult, each was permitted to have a season of the year for their own, to commemorate their own deities and beliefs. The calibration of the year followed the movement of the sun, to keep the elites of the Solar Cult happy. The division of the next section of annual time was given to the Lunar Cult, that is the 28 day month and the week of 7 days incorporates the sacred numbers and planets of the Stellar Cult. MONK Certainly this has to do with the moon. However, the actual monks are a product of the Saturnian Cult and their dogma. This is why they had the habit of cutting a round circle on the top of their heads. Same as the Jewish yarmulke, These signatures were analogues to the planet Saturn, with its conspicuous rings. CEREMONY Common word that in religions indicates the time of ritual. But the name is made of two goddess names. Ceres is the Greek goddess of the earth, connected with harvests and Mon is moon, the Lunar-Feminine influence. In astrology the planets Venus and Moon are compatible. DEACON This may seem unfamiliar until one remembers that the word is the same as decan, the section of 10 degrees that each of the 12 houses of the zodiac are divided into. So, a Deacon or Arch- Deacon gets his name because his original duties in the time of the Stellar Cult was to watch the stars, their stations and motions. Such a personage was titled in accordance with his function. A Deacon was nothing more than an astrologer who watched the stars by night. SEXTON This may seem unconnected to the stars and heavens until we realize that it is the same as the word sextant , which is a instrument the navigators and astronomers use for measuring - guess what, the stars. A sexton is a man with clerical duties, so http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (30 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com how come he is called after an astrologer's tool. The reason is that before we had the modern religions, the gods were the Luminaries or at least were represented by the Luminaries and the stars. The religion of the stars is the earliest religion, and all the subsequent religions and their doctrines are founded on it. NUN This word has also hardly changed in centuries. The earliest goddess of the Stellar period, of the primordial abyss and night sky, called Nun. She was the great virgin. She was also associated with the fish, ( Nun means fish). This refers to the Vesica Piscis, the symbol of the great Creatrix. So today we have the \"Nuns of Christ\" who are also known as the chaste \"Brides of Christ.\" We also derive our word noon from Nun. Noon was never 12 midday, but 12 midnight, when the goddess was seen above in the night sky. The nocturnal dome was her great womb and the planets and stars were seen as the inseminating spermatozoon's or seeds with her. The sun too was seen this way. It was the \"seed\" of God entering her womb or ovum every morning, resulting in life and fruition and abundance. It is for the same reason why it became customary to light great fireworks on special zodiacal days, to represent the seeds of light being planted in the celestial womb for a bright tomorrow. HOURS The word has hardly changed in centuries. It denotes the name of the sun god. Horus was portrayed as the hawk, wearing the solar disc. He was the rising sun, that flew up into the sky. In the early days when one wanted to know what time it was, meaning where the sun was, they said, \"what Horus is it?\" (where is Horus now?). Today we say, \"what hour is it?\" ORISONS In pre-Industrial and Medieval times one did not say “I am going to say my prayers,” but my “orisons.” This word is the same as Horizon, as all Solar Cult practitioners would say their prayers to AMEN or ATON, by turning to the east, where the Sun rose. Horizon, is literally the zone of Horus, or Horus’s Zone. Again we find a Christian word for prayers that has its roots directly in the pagan past. The purveyors of the Christian ethos, who take 7 year theology degrees, are all aware of these connections. They know the origins of their edifices all too well. The horizon is the zone of Horus, whereas on the western side we have the sunset.

So when the sun is consumed by the darkness, we call it the time of sun-set. The three stations of the sun in the sky gave rise to the original Trinity that the Christians later used for their own purposes. The word zone , is actually a derivative of the word Sun anyway. Zone becomes zon, which becomes son, or sun . We commemorate the movement of the sun in the very act of writing. We write from left to right, to emulate the movement of the sun from east to west. For without the light of the sun, there could be no writing and no knowledge. Light is the most common connotation for knowledge, eg., Enlightenment, Illumined, Alumni, Illuminati, Illustrious, Brilliant, Scintillating, Elites, Pupils , etc, . EASTER A long celebrated ritual period, that the Christians particularly recognize as the time of the resurrection of the son of god. What their illustrious seniors do not explain is that the word Easter comes from the compression of the words eastern and star . The star that rises or resurrects on the spring equinoctial point is again, the sun itself and not a man. This is why the Jewish feast of the Passover is called Passover. It is because the sun has literally passed over the equinox at Aries, from the winter seasons into the new year. In fact the feast comes from the Age of Aries, which is why lamb's blood was smeared on the \"doors,\" meaning houses of the zodiac. Easter also contains the word aster , again meaning star. MONA Famous female name that derives from the moon. The most famous Mona is the Mona Lisa , by Leonardo Da Vinci. And many persons have spent time questioning what makes the painting so distinctive. There is something distinctive that has missed their attentions though and that is the name Mona Lisa . The first word is an anagram for Amon (Egyptian God of the Sun) and the second is L’ isa , the goddess of the moon. So the name cryptically expresses the unification of the Luminaries, which was always connotative of harmony and beauty. The figure in the painting is meant to symbolize the mystical Androgyny that comes about after one has conquered duality. Leonardo Da Vinci, like many around the Florentine and Venetian oligarchies, was a high initiate into the Stellar ethos, preserved by the Masonic Brotherhoods of the world. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (32 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com ATONEMENT In the Christian religion we are told to seek atonement with God and for our sins. However, what we are not told is that the word means Aton-ment, suggesting oneness with Aton, the Semitic Adonai. Aton also gives us words like Eaton. MATRIMONY In the Christian world we have the ritual of the coming together of the male and female, under God. The term for this is, however made from the two goddesses names - Maat (goddess of the unification of opposites, still seen above the court-houses, in which one legalizes their bond and Mon for the moon goddess. Marriage was convened under the feminine power. Today the male priests see to it that they assume that role. They do wear the flowing robes of the female and refer to their church as \"Holy Mother Church.\" All the symbolism that appears in church architecture is based on sexual imagery, used on one subliminally after the natural instincts have been suppressed by the cunning patriarchs. MYSTERY All the religious representatives pontificate about the \"great mystery\" that only they know how to mediate with. What we are not told is that the word is Egyptian for woman, namely Myst or Mesta. The mysteries are the feminine Gnosis, of the Great Mother Universe that was always personified by the Female, as was the mathematics and geometry that gave access to the secrets of Her Being. In ancient days it was noticed that the body of the female in regards the menstrual and gestative cycles, were synchronous with the movement of the Luminaries. Thus woman’s body and the name of the goddesses, like Maat, became synonymous with the mysteries of the Universe. The very word \"matter,\" comes from the name of the supreme goddess of the Egyptians. The Solar-centric ethos that came later marginalizes women for this reason. They are given no place in the inner sanctums of the modern orthodox religions because they would be privy to the cover-ups that have been perpetrated to disempowering them. As the new millennium enters we must strive to expose the machinations of the institutionalized and malign religious conclaves, which are no more than criminal organizations, that have sequestered all these truths and so many more, from the ordinary person. Not even a tenth of the books that http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (33 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com have been written are available to the general public, only to those among the corrupt oligarchs of government and religion. The books are indeed privatized, but as the reader can see, we can still uncover their profound truths through subjects like etymology. MINUTE Arises from two goddess names, Min (moon) and Nut (Nuith) both of the Stellar Cult. The former was the keeper of time as it is today. In fact the reason why a watch has three hands is to represent the three important planets associated with Astrological and sidereal temporality. The slow moving hour hand is for the sun (Horus), the quicker moving \"Min-Nut,\" hand is the moon’s hand and the fast ticking hand is for Mercury, the planet that was known to spin fastest around the sun and on its own orbit. The chess-board also preserves this. The King which can only move one square at a time is the sun, the Queen which has more latitude is the vacillating moon and the black and white squares of which the board is comprised represents the day and night of the diurnal motion of the luminaries. This and other games were created by the Stellar Cult, who also worked with the right-brain modalities of expression and comprehension. In sports today, there are three levels of competence and the symbols (medals) given to the victors have astrological significance. The gold is for the sun and is the ultimate prize. The silver medal is obviously for the next luminary, the moon and the bronze symbolizes the Earth itself, as the color of earth is bronze, (or could be Mars, the \"ruddy one\"). Kings are often wearers of medallions as these also denote the sun. Generals and army personnel also wear various solar emblems. HARMONY Again these syllables preserve Sabean iconography. Har was the name of Horus as it was pronounced in Egypt. Mon is moon. Again we have the coming together of the Luminaries, always an analogue of real Harmony . HAIL (HEIL) This is used as the salutation to the sun (see \"Heel Stone\" at Stonehenge). But the word suggestively means to conceal . And that is precisely what the sun does. Think about it !! YOUNGSTER http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (34 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Obviously means young star . When a parent saw their child they called him or her, their young star or son/sun. This is because the child god of Egypt and the beloved of the primal parents of Osiris and Isis was Horus, who was literally the young sun rising in the spring sky. Parents will often say of their good children, they are as \"good as gold.\" This came from the phrase, good as the Golden One , or Horus. PUPIL A word meaning the center of the eye. But it connotes the sun which was always considered the pupil or eye of Horus, the sun god. The sun is the eye of day. We speak of students as \"pupils,\" to represent the fact that wisdom and education makes one finally illumined as the sun. The word alumni connotes the same. AUM/OM This word is similar to Amun or Amon. The Irish alphabet is called the Ogham. This word is, however, pronounced \"Aum.\" The connection of words to mantras should be obvious to those who study the mysteries. As 1 is the root of number, so Aum, it is believed, is the root of all language. It is suggestive that the Celts seem to have recognized this fact in the naming of their alphabet. (For more on this particular subject, see the works of Nigel Pennick, Robert Graves, Charles Squire, Jim Fitzpatrick and Godfrey Higgins, etc,.) ZOROASTER Name of the august Persian mystic of the Cult of Mithras, later adopted as a patron saint by occultists. This fictitious figure is, like Christ and Moses, etc., a composite character, a personification of the sun. He was one of the first solar mystics, worshipped at the dawn of the male patriarchal cults. This is why he is still revered in the cabals of the Masonic and Rosicrucian fraternities. The Cult of Mithras would probably have been the world's most accepted religion but for the advent of Christianity, as propounded by Emperor Constantine around 400 AD. SINISTER Made from the words sin and ster . The latter means star, while the former is the most ancient name for the moon, even more used than Min. All Lunar Cult peoples referred to their goddess as Sin . This is where we derive the word Sinai , which is a mountain mentioned in the Old Testament. This region and the mountain, http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (35 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com like all mountains, was sacred to the astronomers and star- gazers, who would always have stations and altars on the tops of hills and mounts. We still see the word, mount , (moon), before certain place names. Later, in the time of the patriarchal religions, all scions of the Lunar cult were rebuked and vilified. Thus we have the words sinner and lunatic as derogatory terms. The former is so loaded with religious intonations that we cannot see its real origins. It comes from the bigoted solar cult. The remonstration in the Bible- \"go ye and sin no more,\" is not really a call for contrition, as we are told today. It really meant, Go and worship SIN no more, that is the moon, worship the sun instead. Sinners were not wayward Christians. They were the converted and enslaved members of previous Feminine cults. The word harlot and prostitute also referred to the same persons. These were originally the High Priestesses of the previous cults. They worshipped the natural cycles and rejoiced in the bounty of \"mother\" Earth and their credo was one of tolerance and coexistence. They worshipped the night sky as an corporeal manifestation of the body of The Creatrix. They did not reject or repress the natural libidinous energies of the body and respected the sexual drive as a normal and productive power. We get the word sign , from sin. The word comes from the time when we knew that the planets, like the moon, gave signs, meaning astrological intimations. When the moon gave rise to mantic auguries, one would say that \" Sin,\" has shown us the way, or it is a sin or I saw a sign . Now we just say it was a sign , or give us a sign. It all comes from astrology. The ancient name for India was Sindh. The Lunar Cult was very strong there. It was strong in Persia also, which is why the Islamic flags still bear the crescent moon emblem. The name of the moon is preserved in names like Cindy. Cinderella a lunar myth, dealing with the \"Chemycal Marriage,\" amongst other things, has an entire astrological dramatis personae. In fact we still use the term \"stellar cast\" when speaking in movie jargon. It's so old it's new. But the principalities that were focused on the Martian and repressive hegemony, lost no time in eradicating the Lunar Priestesses and their influence and world view. Stories like that of Sodom and Gomorrah, of the Magdalene, the \"Whore of Babylon,\" and of Jesus rejecting and rebuking his mother, will suffice to help one to see propaganda instead of revelation. Or perhaps it is a revelation. But from what agency? http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (36 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Innumerable English place names also contain such origins: CHESTER, GLOUCESTER, ROCHESTER, WORCESTER, DORCHESTER, MANCHESTER CHICHESTER, etc, etc,. This comes about because in the Druidic times, all domiciles and major centers were convened under the stars. The High Druid would observe the surrounding heavens to estimate which stars or constellations of importance were prominent. Then the town or locale would be named and founded on that celestial talisman. Great energy went into this. This is why so many national and state flags and seals as well as heraldic insignias and coats of arms, feature stars and chevrons and strange hybrid animals. The latter device was to represent certain zodiacal houses. Everything on the national flags has to do with the Stellar Gnosis and not politics. The student that has true understanding will realize, that politics is occultism . The world’s political cabals are run by adroit occultists and secret fraternities. This is why though there appear to be so many dialectically opposed parties, each vowing to put things right, nothing ever gets better in life. Politics is based on persuasion and the control over human minds. As Lord McCauley so aptly put it: The object of oratory alone is not truth, but persuasion . Astro-Theological names are equally conspicuous in my own country of Ireland. The entire country was divided by the High Druids into 5 provinces ( Four around One ). ULSTER A corruption of the world El Star , meaning Saturn’s Star . It is an interesting and singular anecdote that the Archetype of Saturn rules the forces of vengeance, karma, oppression and slavery. Interestingly, it is this very Province of Ulster which is the theatre for all the bloody feuds and conflicts between the \"Free\" Irish and the Irish \"Loyalists.\" The name EL probably means that this province was favored by the members of the Saturnian Cult. A study of the various prehistoric burial chambers and sacred mounds there proves this. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (37 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com MUNSTER A variable of Moon Star . This means that the Cult of the Lunar worshippers were domiciled here. Curiously, like the moon, Munster is a very tranquil province, famous for its exquisite landscapes and lakes. LEINSTER This is the Province named for the Solar Cult that governed there. Lein, is a derivation of the word Leo . Leo is the ancient name of the house and domicile of the sun. Leinster, the place under the Lion, is famed for its stately houses and slightly more temperate weather. (See also the English Leister .) Some of the Semitic tribes that peopled the British Isles brought the symbol of the lion to these shores, particularly the Tribe of Dan, which is why there are so many place names beginning with the prefix Dan or Dun , in Celtic countries. CONNAUGHT Conn, like caan, cahen, cohen, etc., means \"serpent,\" and in Hebrew it means Priest. This was the Province of the great and most ancient Stellar Cult. They were always revered as Magi and the symbol of their wisdom was the Serpent. Even Christ, the paragon of the Solar Cult was reminding his disciples to be \"... as wise as Serpents.\" Now this statement is abstruse and enigmatic until we acknowledge that Christ was referring to the \"Serpent People,\" renowned as the keepers of the high arts of mathematics, temple construction, naturopathy and Magick. Ireland and its Cults, however, suffered the same fate as the rest of the world at the advent of the solar Christian paradigm. The solar priest Patrick (called saint), is said to have come down from the \"holy mountain\" and declared to the assembled that he had cast out all the serpents form Ireland. People must have been quite puzzled, as they are today, on hearing this as there have never been any snakes in the land of Ireland. The reader may now know to what the words relate. They refer not to the casting out of snakes (what a job for a famous Saint), but to the Serpent- People, who would indeed be rooted out, lock, stock and barrel, by the descending hegemony, of which Patrick was the ambassador. The Arthurian Legends relate the same tale and truth, of the supplanting of one epoch with another. Many scholars contend that the word Cain and its other spellings refers to the land of Canaan. This is only partly true. The Stellar Cult was also http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (38 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com proliferate in the land of Canaan (which is why this land is so denegrated in the Old Testament). However Canaan could not compete in majesty with the nearby Egypt, which really contributed to the world’s civilization. Canaan can rightly be considered a satellite locale. Now this brings us back to the words cain or koen , etc,. This word actually derives not from Canaan, but from the Egyptian’s name for their own country, which was Khenn or Khem. This is were the words chemistry and alchemy come from. Now the word for Egypt was Khen which became cahen, cain, canaan, coen, koen, conn, etc,. The word Khan derives from it also. The male name Kenneth (Ken), means, 'man of Egypt,' and the English county of Kent, was named by travelers and settlers from Egypt and the Mediterranean who were undoubtedly astrologers and Siderealists, expert in the navigational sciences. MEATH (pronounced Mathe) Now the last of the Provinces is Meath. This was the central and administrative province. One of the derivations of the word is Mide, meaning middle. This, however, relates directly back to the Egyptian goddess of balance Maat, whose hierogram also stood for the fraction 1/2. Meath was home of the Druid Counsels and Tara the capitol, the seat of the High Chieftans. It was encircled and protected by 7 bastions or Fences (sacred stellar number). Tara is yet another goddess name, but it also relates to the stars. Many tombs to the Gaelic Queens are found in Meath. It was a Matriarchal era. The fact that Meath was an administrative center is suggestive because the main symbol of the goddess Maat was the Scales of Balamce. These have long since been the emblem for the administrative and judicial professions. In Scotland the word Mother is still pronounced \"Mayther.\" Mother comes from Maat or Mayat or Meatha, etc,. In Ireland there are is the goddess known as Mabd (Maeve). PHALLIC The treasures of Ireland, Nuada's Sword, Lugh’s Lance, Dagda’s Cauldron and the Stone of Fal , happen to be striking analogues to the Tarot’s Wand, Sword, Cup and Disk. Since the word fal means stone, the Stone of Fal literally means Stone of Stones. It was probably a powerful crystal which radiated energy. It was stolen by the Stuarts of Scotland and from there taken by the English and is said to be under the Coronation Seat in London. One arcane story tells that the original stone was that upon which http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (39 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com the Biblical Jacob had his dream of the ladder reaching to heaven. The stone was then brought to Ireland by the prophet Jeremiah and the Tribes of Israel - particularly that of Dan. In Sanskrit there is the primordial Creatrix called Mahat. In the Scandinavian legends we have the primeval goddess Tiamat. Similar words, same entity. For a study of Celtic History see: Celtic Myth and Legend, by Charles Squire.

I’d like to interpret this for you, but I think it might be better if you just look out of your window. I guess that the assembled masses thought, \"What are those lunatics talking about now?\" And we still don’t get it! ETYMOLOGY (the lost key) Here we can continue the theme of Etymology with a few more examples. The reader will see the role played by Egypt. NETER Gives the word nature . Also nether (as in netherworld) and neuter and neutron , etc,. Both meant, the land of the gods. Neter means - gods, or spirits or soul in Egyptian. This latter force was personified as a god or goddess. We also get neuter from it. The gods were often considered sexless. The word enter is an anagram. There was no dichotomy in those days between the inner and the outer, the mind and the cosmos. Nature was God. The ancients saw themselves as literally being inside the womb of the great Universal Mother whom they called Maat, Nuith or Isis. MATTER From Mahat (Sanskrit). Means the Great Flux. Comes from the Egyptian Maat , giving words like mother, maths, measure, meter, mate, master , etc,. A \"master\" is one who is in balance, who operates in accordance with divine or natural law- obeying MAAT . Measure and Mathematics arise from this Maat. Mankind discovered that number and geometry was inherent in the Universe due to the menstrual cycle. All number and calculation was therefore derived from and connected to the female body, http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (41 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com which is why the goddess was sacred, being the origin of it all. Today’s science is possible because of the female. This is why \"math\" is a close derivation of Maat. The scientist forgets that the mystical traditions are therefore as 'scientific' as their work, more- so sometimes. Freemasons use the capitol letter \"G\" between the compass and the rule. \"G\" was an ideogram for the throne of the goddess Isis/Maat. Demeter the Greek Earth goddess means The- Meter/Mater/Mother, from Maat. In the New Testament, we find Matthew, who was a \"Tax-Collector\" and whose symbol was the Scales (?) KABALA This is an Egyptian word. The syllables are the very names of the 2 parts of the soul, known in Egypt as the KA-Self and the BA - Self. The LA is a form of AL or EL, meaning God or One (see, Allah). These three phonemes become the first letters of the English alphabet, A, B, C, or (AA, BA, KA), The English alphabet, like the Sanskrit, Celtic and Runic, is a magickal alphabet , though this actual truth has been lost. The Ba is the root of ABBA (father) of KAABA (in Medina) of BABY and of the verb - To BE (to Exist). The root Ka may give the modern word - Character , and is the root of Cast , Christ (Karast), Kal (time) and Karma (Justice), etc,. In Latin the word Cabalas happens to mean horse. So due to this chance association, the real Kabalists, those operating behind the scenes of government and religion, have often used as their code symbol, a black horse. This symbol is found on numerous logos as well as in architecture. SOLOMON This clearly shows the words SOL (sun) and MON (moon). However, it also can be expressed as SOL - OM - ON, giving the name of the sun in the three sacred languages of the ancient Indo- European and Mediterranean peoples. SOL is Sumerian, OM is Brahmin (Hindu) and the ON is Egyptian. The ancient capitol city of the Solar-Cult on the Nile was called ON, later renamed by the Greeks to Heliopolis (city of the Sun). Even today we say getting \"on\" with it, moving \"on-ward,\" etc,. We turn a light \"on.\" Moreover, the Greek word for Being, is ON (onto). The English call their first number, ONE (again meaning light). When one is alone he is \"One,\" (as is the sun alone), The Hindi we have YONI (which relates to the Female, the birthplace). Surely even Masons would never claim the actual http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (42 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com existence of Solomon? As Kenealy shows, he is not noticed by Herodotus, not by Plato, not by any writer of standing. It is most extraordinary he says, “that the Jewish nation, over whom but a few years before mighty Solomon had reigned in all his glory, with a magnificence scarcely equaled by the greatest monarchs, spending nearly eight thousand million of gold on a temple, was overlooked by the historian Herodotus, writing almost necessarily within a few miles of the splendid capital of the national Jerusalem? How can this be accounted for, he asks. Nay, not only are there no proofs of the twelve tribes of Israel having ever existed, but Herodotus, the most accurate of historians, who was in Assyria when Ezra flourished, never mentions the Israelites at all...How is this possible? - Helena Blavatsky EMMANUEL This is an Anglicized version of the ancient OM ON EL, again the names of the sun. (Those who doubt the veracity of this can check the numerology of the various names of Jesus and of deity to find further confirmation). HARMONY Har was the Egyptian for Horus the sun, Mon is the Moon. The coming together of the Luminaries, the opposites creates Harmony !! ISRAEL A fascinating composite word, ISIS, RA and EL. These are three gods of the ancient Cults. There where 4 major Cults, one replacing the other through time. Finally these Cults joined up and became one. The earliest cult is the Stellar, next came the Lunar, then the Saturnian and then the Solar. The illusion that their where voluminous pantheons of gods is a result of these cults. (see, Da Vinci and Bottecelli, Mona Lisa and Last Supper , etc,.) HEBREW The word Hebrew did not relate to a particular race but to the \"Wise Ones\" - originally the Ibaru - or high priests of Egypt. A chance similarity to the words for \"shepherd\" or \"wanderer\" (Hibiru) allowed it to be transposed into a racial title. The so-called \"Hebrew\" alphabet comes originally from Egypt. It is in fact the \"long lost\" non-hieroglyphic script. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (43 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The Hebrew language is considered to be very old, and yet there exists no trace of it anywhere in the old monuments, not evening Chaldea - Helena Blavatsky ( The Secret Doctrine ) According to Sir W.

Hebrew is composed of the hieroglyphs, symbols and myths of the Egyptians and their gods - Valentia Straiton ( The Celestial Ship of the North ) It is therefore apparent that the translation of the holy books of Judaism into Greek was a watershed in the development of the Hebrew Qabalah, since it naturally exposed these texts to the application of Hellenistic alphabetical symbolism and isopsephy for the first time. Before then, no such practice existed, or could have existed, since alphabetic numeral were unknown to the Jews - Kieran Barry ( The Greek Qabalah ) (See works of Max Dumont, Gerald Massey, Alvin Boyd Kuhn, http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (44 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Helena Blavatsky, Valentia Straiton, John Hewitt Brown, Arthur Dyott Thompson, Muata Ashby and Moustapha Gadalla for more on this). LUNA This name of the moon, really means Alone. The moon was called the \"Lone One.\" Another common name of the moon was Min (see minute) or Mon (see money). Later when the Solar Cult took over persons of this previous cult became rebuked as \"monsters\" or \"lunatics.\" SOL This term for the sun really means single and alone. There were two suns at one time. From it we get sole, when speaking of being alone, also - soliloquy, solitude, solitaire, solo, solace, etc,. CATASTROPHE The word actually means the destruction of a star. Such events were known and considered very ill omens. DISASTER Also means the destruction of a star. Literally - no star . It can also be translated as \"evil star.\" AUM (OM) This means sun, light and oneness. It comes from the Egyptian, Ahom, which was their first letter (A). The ideogram of Ahom was the golden eagle, still seen with the letter \"A\" and on innumerable symbols. In Celtic lands the Alphabet was called Ogham, but this word is pronounced Om or Aum . The connections between the worlds magical alphabets have been noticed and written upon for centuries. GRAIN The original of this is a word with several meanings, all related. It means seed, gold, sun and /or woman. The female name Grainne (pronounced granya) come from it. The word green derives from it and therefore originally refers to the color gold and to the sun. This is the reason why there are place names all over Celtic countries like; Greenhill, Greencastle, Greenwich, etc,. They have nothing to do with the color green but everything to do with the color gold and the sun (see green card, gold card and http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (45 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com gilders, sovereigns, guineas, crowns). The English used numerous such transliterations to disguise the original meanings and obliterate the previous traditions. They did not wish modern man to know that the ancients were sun observers and astronomers. The site of the time meridian is at Greenwich, England. The word Grain links to sun because the sun was often thought of as a grain or seed. Moreover, the ancients knew that the sun’s light opened the seeds in the earth. The word meant \"woman,\" because women were considered the literal \"house\" of the male seed. SIDHE Means mound and describes a burial place in the Celtic lands. But the word also means \"woman\" and \"breast.\" In Sanskrit it means \"power\" or \"magical force.\" The dead are put into the rise or mound which represents the breasts or the womb. This custom was seen among the Gaels, Egyptians, Teutons, the Gallic peoples and the Scandinavians. GAELIC Comes from Gal , meaning white or pure. It has the secondary meaning of \"foreigner,\" connoting a stranger from far away. May originate with the Sumerian, Ab-Gal, meaning \"masters of wisdom.\" One of the great Celtic tribes was called the Fir Bolg, incorrectly and habitually translated as \"Men of the Bags,\" when in fact it really means the \"Men of Wisdom.\" EGO Gives the modern egg . The ego is the inner sun. The egg when cracked open looks like the sun, with the yellow yolk. GENESIS Really means the Genes of Isis or Generation of Isis. This is because the original story in that so-called first book of the Bible is really an Egyptian Sidereal Tale, taught to initiates in the great Nile temples. Moreover, the syllable Gen means \"woman\" or \"queen.\" In fact this latter word derives from it. \"Queen\" came from qwen or gwen. Gwyn, guen or gwen (which also means \"white\"), also gives the Celtic word Guinevere, meaning \" fair woman,\" or \"white queen.\" The original \"White Queen,\" was not so much Guinevere, but Isis, Egyptian goddess of the moon, wife of Osiris, the original King Arthur. This fascinating name also gives Guin-Eve , that is Queen Eve, relating to the primal parent, http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (46 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com thus confirming the esoteric status of the Arthurian legends. Gyn meant woman, hence gynecology. We also get the drink Gin, named so because it was favored by women. The word Genes (passed down from the mother), Jini, Genealogy and the female name Jean also come from it. \"Genius,\" is called so, because this was someone who was infused with the Muses, the female creative force. A child who was a genius was called so because his \"genes\" were good, meaning that his mother was the cause of the skills. 'Genius' implied that one was favored by the goddess. In India we find the term Guna , meaning inherited traits . We also get genetics, genealogy, gentle and gentry from it. A \"gentleman\" was one that had the feminine sensibilities awakened. One of the figures that stood for the female and still does, is the letter or symbol X (from XI, the Greek, pronounced She ). This is why cars still often bear the phoneme X or XI, etc., to subliminally feminize them. And this symbol is found on other product logos also. The syllable Gen, also means garden. Genesis can mean, the Garden of Isis, referring to the Earth or even the Universe which we, her children, inhabit. SION As in Mt. Sion or Priory de Sion. This is a common term in Christianity and Judaism, yet few know really to what it refers. It refers to the Royal (Holy) family of Egypt, the four principle gods upon which the Pharaoh founds his dynasty. The gods are Set, Isis, Osiris and Nephthys. The first letters of their names make the word S.I.O.N. The numerology of these letters is 1.9.6.5, same as ROSE ( 9.6.1.5 ), which is why the rose is used often on occult circles and used as a symbol of royalty. YULE Comes from the same root as wheel. At Yule (the Winter Solstice, Christmas) the zodiac has rotated a full turn, like a wheel. The Roman title or name \"Julius\" comes from this. Julius Caesar for instance, was crowned at the winter solstice, under the god Jupiter. Caesar was infatuated with the Venus/Maia, which he considered his patron goddess. LAZARUS Originally French L’azuras or L’asur, means, the Asura. Asur, Asura. Asurya is the sun. The Egyptian name for Osiris is Asur. The raising of Lazarus, is connected to the raising of the dead sun at the Solstice points, especially winter when Virgo is on the http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (47 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Eastern horizon. Later during the Solar Cult the raising of Lazarus in the home of the Biblical Mary, another virgin, was to do with the opening of the Egyptian New Year, July 25th, then in the sign of Virgo. Moreover, the word Asur (sun) also gives the prefix for the male gender, Sir or Sire. Even in India it is the same - Sri. These mean the \"noble ones.\" DAVID / DOVE Means Divide and indicates 'Geometry.' The letters of the word seen geometrically make the Star of David. The two \"D\"s become a circle, the \"A\" is a triangle, the \"V\" is an downward facing triangle. We also derive the word Dove from David. This is why there is a dove on the modern credit card and why the Royalty also use the symbol. In Spanish the word for Dove is Columba, or Columbanus. This is where the Knights of Columbus get their name. The District of Columbia, British Columbia, Columbia (SA), Columbia Pictures, Columbia Records, Christopher Columbus and Columbine High School, all derive from the secret meaning of this term and symbol. The name of Columbus , was adopted by Christopher Columbus because he was in the pay of the Knights of Malta, the real founders and owners of America. We still see the pictures of the ships in which Columbus sailed. On the sails was the red cross of the Knights of Malta, also known as the Knights of Columbus. Another of their symbols, the dove, is also found on Greenpeace , and in the movie For your eyes only , the criminal group of crack assassins use the symbol. The Knights of Columbus trace their occult history from the actual Assassins of the Persians. CHAOS Consciously associated with confusion and darkness, this Egyptian word meant Light. It was spelt KHUS and meant among many things, angels or beings of light, the pure, exalted souls of the dead, stars which set not. TIME From Amit (Sanskrit), which means endless or immeasurable. Also comes from Tammuz, which gives Thomas (see disciples) and Thames, etc,. The Thames river in England is also known as the Isis, (the Nile was seen as a personification of that goddess). The word chimes comes from Time. \"Ch\" often replaced the hard \"T.\" When the great cults decided to join together, the prime symbols and even concepts of each had to be represented in the http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (48 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com new gestalt. In subsequent consensus, it was decided that the year would represent the Solar Cult's idea of time and periodicity, being calibrated upon the movement of their archetype, the sun. The month would be calibrated along lines that would suit the Lunar Cult, featuring their cardinal numbers, while the week would conform to the paradigms of the Stellar Cult, featuring their sacred number 7. Many other idioms of our age come from this activity, being placations to and commemorations of the power cults of antiquity. The symbols that are found on paper money, for instance, reflect just these historical events. AGE The word Age, comes from the word for goat Aegis, being, therefore, a reference to Saturn (or Kronos), to his sign Capricorn, that has the astrological symbol of a goat. Saturn is the oldest god of time and of cause and effect. CALENDAR From Sanskrit Kala, meaning time. Also from kalatar, signifying a chart for the division of time. TEMPLE From the word tempus , meaning time. The Temple is connected to the zodiac, the abode of god. Words that feature the EL prefix or suffix arise due to the time of the Cult of Saturn or El. Words like angel, angle, gospel, circle, evangelist, apostle, disciple, Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, elite, elect, elder, elevated, Elohim, Elton, Annabel, elevation , etc,. all arise from the time of that Cult. SEVEN From the Egyptian Sevekh, a god. Also from Seshet (see Statue of Liberty). Also from Sebek-Ra, the crocodile god ruling over time. SHAMAN Comes from semen, referring to the male energy of creation. It may also relate to She-Man (Xi-Man) , since the concept and reality of mystical androgyny was central to the practice of the shaman and esoteric magicians. CAIN Comes from the word Cahen (or Caan) , known even in the http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (49 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Mexicos, as meaning Serpent or Priest. Today we have Cohen . This is the Hebrew line of temple Priests. It also gives Canaan, called by the Patriarchs a land of Serpent worship. The worshippers of the Serpents were the Stellar or Sidereal Cult, which preceded the Solar, Lunar and Saturnian Cults. The Stellar Cult were renowned as the keepers of the great wisdom, as masters of the zodiac. This is the reason why we even hear Christ reminding his disciples to be as \"...wise as serpents.\" However, it became imperative that the later Church Fathers utterly remove from history or theology any mention of their existence. The Indian or Persian term Khan, comes from this Can also. The place in France called Cannes, is named so because of it being a place of the Stellar Cult. It is not by chance that the film festivals are held there. Almost all the film production companies use sabean symbolism and the personages behind them, regard themselves as the new priests of the Gnosis. (See; Industrial Light and Magic, Dreamworks, Touchstone, Paramount, Columbia, Universal, Orion, Lion's Gate, Viacom, Hollywood Pictures, Tristar, MGM, RKO, CBS, Arista, Gramercy, Castle Rock, Trilogy, CTS , Cannon, Starz, FOX, Meridian , etc, etc, etc.,) \"Hollywood,\" has that name for a reason. In ancient times the Druids of the Stellar Cult used to cut their magic wands from only one kind of tree. The wands were made from only one kind of wood, the wood from the Holly Tree. So we still find that those magi in the movie business are putting their \"spells\" on us. The makers of cinema know all about the libido, sexuality, desires and drives of the human beings that they are trying to pacify and control. The fact that \"programs\" are called \"programs\" is fascinating in itself. Programs are what one puts in a computer. They see the human mind as a computer and have been putting in their programs very day for decades. This is what is called \"White Magic,\" or Industrial Light and Magic , as some prefer to say. ABRACADABRA This word is Persian. It is an incantation and really reads, Abr - Acad - Abr. This translates as, god-the one-god . Literally, \"there is but one true God.\" HOOD As in the composite myth of Robin Hood. The word may derive from Hod or Hog, which in Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian means Hawk. Robin the Hawk , This fits, as he was identified with Horus and with adroit marksmanship, skill and cunning as well as the http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (50 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com fact that he fought the powers of evil. MYSTERY From Egyptian, Mest or Myst, which meant woman. The serpent was the symbol for mystery and the Egyptian glyph for woman was also interpretable for serpent. The connection between the Cult of the Priestess and the symbol of the serpent goes back to the pre-deluvian epoch and is an entire study of itself. MASS From the word for Woman and also from Mes . This was the annual cake made from the clay gathered from the banks of the Nile and considered extremely sacred. It was ritually baked as small cakes and symbolized the life-giving properties of the female and the Nile which was personified as Isis. BIBLE From the word Buka . This Buka was the reeds which grew on the banks of the Nile. It gave one papyrus. From Buka comes Book. Buka was also called Biblos. TESTAMENT From the word Testes , referring to the male generative organs, where the 'seeds of life,' are kept. Words were often thought of as the seeds of life. Moreover, the word Testes also connotes the light of the sun, without which all writing and reading would be impossible. The reason why one writes from left to right was because this is how the sun moved, from east to west across the sky. In other climes this would have been different. (See, \"Moon Letters,\" etc,.) GOD This word for Deity, originates from the Anglo-Saxon word Gott , which actually means Goat. This arises because the original tribes and peoples worshipped Deity as a goat, a stag or bull, or any horned animal. Due to the travesty of Christianity the very goat, symbol of God, is now the symbol of Satan the opposer of God. All original gods were shown with horns on their heads. This is why Michelangelo shows Moses with them, to mark his wisdom and spirituality. This is why monarchs and shamans have them in their head-dresses, i.e., crowns and coronets. Jews wear the Sheepskin. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (51 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com PAN This word means the number five, Pente. Five has long been associated with God, prophets and ascended masters. There are many corporations that employ the phoneme and syllable Pan or Pen , etc,. Esoterically, five relates to the Quintessence, to the \"Akash\" and to the etheric level. Alchemically, the symbol of the Dragon, symbolizes the Fifth Element. A dragon is fire (its breath), water (its scaly skin), air (its wings) and earth (its talons) in one. The Dragon turns up in fables and dreams, etc., to represent transcendence. The pagan deity Pan is also nothing more than a symbol for the same transcendence. The god in associated with nature and forests and, therefore, corresponds to the Celtic Herne (Cernunnos) and to the Hindu Shiva. HERMES The Greek equivalent of Thoth, god of medicine, writing and speech. The Celts had Herne, the god of forests, the animals and wisdom. The word also means Serpent. A \"herme\" is a phallic stone like an obelisk. So Hermes also meant man, probably \"the Serpent Man.\" (See the first card of the Tarot's Major Arcana, The Magician .) The Romans renamed Hermes, as Mercury. From this we get the modern word firm. And interestingly this is the name given to corporate structures and edifices, to imply their masculinity, the fact that they are commercial, and therefore under the auspices of Mercury, the god of commerce. CHEMISTRY and ALCHEMY These come from the original name of the land of Egypt, Khem (Khenn). This meant the \"Black Land.\" But Khem was the cradle of the naturopathic arts, of chemistry and herbalism as well as other sciences of the body. This is why the words Chemistry and Alchemy , still bear the root and why the medical profession still uses the Caduceus of Hermes or Thoth, Egyptian gods of healing. EGYPT The word gives us Gypsy. The Gypsies were reputed to have come from there. NUT The name of the great sky goddess and one of the primal pantheon, also connected to the Tree of Life motif. Still today we refer to the fruits of certain trees as nuts. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (52 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com ALIVE Comes from the Hebrew Aleph, meaning the breath. Obviously, breath bestows life. Aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It also gives aleve and elf , etc,. The corporate logo FILA is it in reverse (thus connoting death). HERO Also comes from the word HERU (Horus). He was the original hero. When people celebrate they chant \"Hooray,\" which is also the name of the sun-god, Horus. BRITAIN From the goddess Baratana and the name of India, given by the Indo-Europeans, who later came to England. Today the name of India is Bharat. The Indians were known as the Barats or Parats. English are the Brits. INDIA Derives from the ancient word Sindh, which relates to the the Cult of the Moon. The Lunar Cult was very strong in Asia, as a look at the various flags and emblems will confirm. The myth of Cind eralla, comes from this, the fact that the moon was considered the bride of the sun, that she wedded when entering into the sign of Leo, the sun's \"palace.\" NOAH The name is of the Bible Patriarch who built the Ark and survived the deluge which destroyed all mankind. In Irish legend the fifth and greatest High King was called Nuada (also spelt Nuah and pronounced Nada), came to Ireland after a great deluge which destroyed all mankind. He had come in a \"magical ship\" with a few of his people. The Mayans speak of their deluge survivor Nata, left to re-people the earth. The myth is found all over the world. THE ARK This comes from the Hebrew word for the human breath and also of the spirit, Ruach (Rkh), when an A is placed in front of the rkh, it gives arkh. The real Ark is the Spirit or womb of all life. This is also the reason why we read of the dove being sent out from the Ark. The dove is a symbol for the Holy Spirit. Boats and ships have always been used as symbols for the womb, which is why all http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (53 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com mariners referred to their ships as \"She,\" and why female heads were mounted onto the prows. The Christening of a newly built ship with champagne or wine, etc., is to simulate the act of insemination. ABRAHAM From the Sanskrit Vedas, Brahma, god of creation. His consort was Saraswati. Curiously, the consort of Abraham, father of the Hebrews, was Sarah. This god gave his name to the Bacchus of the Romans and also to their Brumalia, or winter solstice. This word though Latin actually derives from Brahma, the supreme creator god of the Hindus, god who may be equated in some ways with Saturn or Kronos. The connection between the Brahmins and the Romans had been carefully camouflaged. VEDAS The holy books of the Hindus. The word is the same as that of Eddas, the holy legends of the Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon Skalds. Only thing is these are peoples thousands of miles away from each other. Both Veda and Edda mean \"Teachings of Knowledge.\" (see AVEDA) ADAM Comes from the Egyptian Atum, the very first Man/God. The numerology of A. T. U. M is 1 . 2 . 3 . 4, the building blocks of the numerical system and also symbolizing the Cross. (See Myth of Christ). The Semites have Adam, the Hindus the Atma or Atman. Another supposedly Semitic permutation of the word is Adam Kadmon. However, this like the entire \"Hebrew\" alphabet comes originally from Egypt. It is in fact the \"long lost\" non-hieroglyphic script. Adam Kadmon (God-Man) comes from Adam -Ka-Amon, meaning the \"Man of the Sun\" or the \"Solar Man.\" SAXON Comes from the term Issac's Sons, or Sons of Issac. The Anglo- Saxon or Caucasian peoples where first thought of Israelites (Semites). The word Caucasian did not originally designate race at all. It merely signified that one had passed into the Western lands by way of the Caucasus mountains. The Saxons were a mix of Indo-European and Mediterranean blood. They possessed rituals and symbols shared by the Semites, of which the Hebrews are a small branch. This accounts for the plethora of Semitic symbolism attending the royal pageantry and ceremony and other http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (54 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com national motifs, like the Irish Harp (really David’s harp) THOR Same as the Celtic A-thor or Arthur. Both warrior kings and axe wielders, both holding a court of Heroes. Ireland had Artur. Arthur sat at a Round table, hence was not a king in the ordinary sense. There is no head, at a round table. The Celts were giving us a message. Kingship arose because of the democratic togetherness of all. KING Comes from the root Kin , like kindred. Originally the King was kindred, \"my kin,\" really - \"of my blood.\" The final \"g\" is both phonetic and may also represent the serpent or even the throne of the \"Mother,\" upon which he, the king sits. Throughout the ancient world the king or pharaoh always received the right of rule from the female goddess. He officiated for Her. The symbols for woman and serpent were often interchangeable in ancient cultures. The Egyptian hierogram for woman was a serpent, for instance. CZAR/CSAR Comes from the Assyrian, Sar, meaning Sun King. This is probably were we get the name Sarah. DAGDA One of the supreme kings and elders of ancient Ireland. The Phoenicians worshipped him as Dagon, the Fish God. We may derive the words Dadda or Daddy from it. CULHULAINN Same as the Mayan Kukulkan or Quetzalcoatl, the \"Feathered Serpent,\" who came from the west. Both had strange births, tremendous strength, long life-spans and magical gifts. ATHENS Considered as named after Athena. But originally both names came from Egypt’s Aten. Aten meant TEN . Aten was a solar god. Words like attention and attain come from this. (See companies like AETNA, TENA, EATON , etc,.) EAMONN http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (55 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Comes from the Egyptian Amon or sun. AUTUMN Comes from the word ATUM, the dying god of Egypt. The sun does wane in the autumn. TATTOO Which means to mark, inscribe or design. The god of Writing in Egypt was Tehuti, Thoth, earlier called Tat or Teuth. We derive words like thought, taught, truth and Tarot from this name. TA , is used a word used to thank in Celtic Britain and it means hidden or sacred in Persian. Thoth /Toth, was the god of measurement and counting, so we have the words today and total and to tot-up . Its all Egyptian ! CHRIST (JESUS) Comes from Egyptian Karast, meaning Anointed. This gives Caress, Cast, Krishna. The Chaldean name of the sun was CHRIS. Karast means to Caress with Oil (hence Crisco oil). Christ was called the \"Anointed One,\" accordingly. The name Krishna also gives rise to Tristna or Tristan (Arthurian legend). Both had evil uncles, both were physically beautiful, both masters of music (flute and harp) and both played to shepherds, etc, etc,. Jesus comes from Jarrus or Jasus who was also called Iesus by the Romans. The Romans knew this being as the son of a high priest and dedicated to Neptune. This is of interest since Neptune is the planet ruler of Pisces the sign of the zodiac that is associated, esoterically, with Christianity. This Jasus was known to all Rome, but had no connection to Israel. Alexander the Great made his acquaintance. Moreover, the Druids had a patron god called Hesus, that had died and who would return as a Messiah. Volumes exist that have detailed the connection of the Christian Messiah with the more ancient Druidic schools. The Druids also worshipped the \"Bloody Cross,\" long prior to the people of the Middle East or Romans. Mustafa Gadalla has exposed the fact that the entire \"Holy Family\" of the Christians derive from the dramatis personae of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. (See his classic Historical Deception ). MARS Comes from the word Mark . The House of Mars is Aries, the symbol is the Ram. RAM is the reverse of MAR. RAMA is another ancient name for God. Mars was symbolized by the human http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (56 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com thumb, the palm of the hand and by the capitol letter \"M.\" This is due to the fact that a weapon such as a sword (a seminal Martian symbol) when gripped, sits in the palm, while the enclosing fingers make an M figure over the hilt. Mars was the God of war and aggression. In Arthurian legend the enemy of Arthur’s Court was King Mark . The other adversary of Arthur, Mordred, is Scorpio where the planet Mars was said to rule prior to the re-discovery of Pluto. We still say that something is \"marred\" if it goes wrong. NUCLEAR An ancient word, spelt Nukt or Nukta, meaning Power. Still we use the slang \"nuke.\" There may be a correlation between the word nuclear , and the name of the Sumerian god-king Enki, who is supposed to have brought mankind the secret of science, particularly genetics. The vowel-less consonants of this name are, NK. This is also the root of the word ANKH which was the symbol of the gods (really spelling or indicating ANU. N. AKI). The symbol represented their special status and knowledge and the fact that they were, in all likelihood, keepers of the mysteries of the science of life. ATOM From the word Aton , meaning light or sun or force. Atoms have been compared to miniature solar systems. This word also appears to correlate with a god of ancient times, specifically the progenitor god - Atum, who was known and described, suggestively, as the First Cause. RA Meaning Light. This gives us the words Ray and Raj . Many English names end in ray or rey to commemorate the light- (Geoffrey, Deborah, Sandra, etc,). NUMBER Comes from the Egyptian god KNUMN, who was the Potter-God, who fashions man, instilling in him the frequencies of life. ART From the Egyptian Aart , meaning the Uraeus Serpent, which may have to do with the Kundalini energy without which their could be no life-force or creativity. The ways of Art are subtle like the physical movements of a snake. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (57 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com PETER From Petra and back to Ptah, the supreme god of the Memphite Egyptians. Peter was hung on a cross inverted. RHINE The word comes from Rune , which meant mystery or holy. PHOENICIANS This comes from the word Phoenix , the bird which rises from its own ashes after 5-600 years. The Phoenicians were star-gazers, astronomers and master navigators. They were the only workers of skill in wood and were the words greatest maritime people. They were of the Mediterranean stock, same as the Sumerians, Egyptians and Celts. The Venetians and Irish Fenians may be related in some manner to these seafarers and architects. ACCURACY Comes from Acura or Mercuria. Mercury was the god of swiftness, agility and accuracy. (See ACURA company.) Dogs were also referred to as curs, because the animal was sacred to Hermes, Mercury and Anubis. The dog is also the companion of the Fool in the Tarot Arcanum. The planet Mercury was known in ancient times and recognized to be the fastest moving of the planets, both on its own axis and in its orbit around the sun. This latter orbit lasts 88 days and this number signifies the planet Mercury and is found in many areas. Several car companies and newspaper, etc., use various Mercurial symbols. MINOTAUR This is a composite word. It refers to the zodiac. The place of initiation was the Labyrinth, leading to the dangers of the underworld. This place was not physical, but in the zodiac. The place between Taurus and Gemini. The end of the word Ge/MINI and the beginning of the word TAUR/us gives MINITAUR or MINOTAUR. The Milky Way happens to run right between these two signs. The Milky Way runs across the zodiac from this point until it passes throughout the middle of Scorpio and Sagittarius, an area of the zodiac of great importance to sidereal astrologers and magicians. It also happens that the Archer of Sagittarius points his arrow (at least did originally) toward the galactic center in the constellation of Sagittarius, specifically Scutus. Many stately houses use effigies of the Archer for this reason and the chief http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (58 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Masonic Hall in Washington DC is on Shooter's Hill. ATON Is the root of the word Atom and gives us words like Eaton and atonement. It is also an anagram of NATO . In the later Hebrew, Aton becomes Adon (Adonai) the name for God. And along with E, the letters A, T, O and N, are the most frequently used of the twenty-six English letters. AMEN Comes at the end of every Christian prayer, yet is the Egyptian word for the sun. SEAT / EAST Come from the Egyptian name for the goddess Aset (Isis). Her headdress was also a seat and she was often referred to as the star in the east. NASA This is an anagram of the Hindu Sana or Asana, meaning sacred practice and power. Moreover, the word Nasa happens to be the initials of the four principle members of the Egyptian Pantheon. The royal gods. Their names in Egyptian are Nephthys, Asar, Set and Aset. (Nephthys, Osiris, Set and Isis). LEAVES The pages of a book are called leaves due to the fact that the ancients, such as the Druids, would write or mark leaves and often tie leaves of different trees on a cord, to represent words. The Egyptians wrote on papyrus, which is also a leaf, so to speak. The Celtic peoples had 13 trees that they considered sacred. However, the reason why these trees where really sacred was that they represented the 13 signs of the known zodiac. The words or intelligence which words communicated was therefore about the stars. PAPER From the Egyptian word Papera (papyrus plant). PYRAMID From PIR-E-MIT, meaning the \"division of Ten,\" (or of number). Ten or Aten was Man, whose body represented wholeness, http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (59 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com oneness. This is why Vitruvius, Agrippa, Pacioli, Leonardo Da Vinci, etc., depict Man spread like a Pentacle, divided. Images that represent the division or factorization of number will be seen in and around the sculptures and depictions of God and the saints, like Buddha, Christ, Krisha, Brahma, Vishnu, Ishwara, Hermes, etc,. APPLE From the word Apollo . Also Avalon meant the Land of the Apples, a veiled reference to the pre-diluvian Garden of Eden and the Egyptian creation myths, which were known throughout the world. Saint Paul in the Bible is a analogue to this ancient mythic character and today we have the names Paul and Paolo , etc,. The name Apollo also refers to the earth’s axis or Pole. This is because the earth was seen like an apple or 'fruit' in space. There are several companies that make use of the word Polo . Moreover, in ancient times the Siderealists used the symbol of an apple to represent the female ovum. Females were the goddesses that gave life. Therefore, they were called the Trees of Life. Their produce were the fruits, the apples from the proverbial Tree. (We still speak of the \"fruit of the loins\"). So apples were ovum that are produced by the female body in order to incubate life. The worm or Serpent that encircles the great Tree and the Apples is the male spermatozoon. Its entering of the individual ovum was always referred to by the ancients as the \"Biting of the Apple.\" Today we still refer to problem children as “rotten apples.” MOSES An Egyptian word, merely meaning son of , as in the more specific Thotmoses (son of Thoth), etc,. There could be a connection between Moses and Menes, the first Pharaoh of the first dynasty of Egypt. It also derives from Meshe, Anointed one or One who Anoints , indicating an Intiator. Moses was connected to the Eighteenth dynasty of renegade Pharaohs. VENICE / VIENNA Names follow on from Venus, the goddess of Love and also sexual excess (see Venereal). ARISE Meaning to rise up. It comes from the same root as does Aries. The sun was seen to literally rise-up on the spring equinox, so it became a commonplace to say to one another \"rise and shine\" or http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology.html (60 of 65)22/11/2004 13:17:35"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com \"arise good knight\" because the sun's rising was in the House of Aries. In calendar months Aries falls in April. This word comes from Aperio, meaning to open or I open, because the sun opens the year on the Spring Equinox, in Aries, in April. Many corporate logos and names are based on this word and on Aries imagery. SEARS, SURE, XEROX, SIERRA, REXALL, REDKEN, LEXUS, DATSUN, NISSAN, ARS, APS , etc,. KEEPER As in \"Keeper of the Keys,\" or \"keeper rings.\" Comes from the Egyptian Khepera , which was the title of the Scarabeus Beetle, which represented the sun at the highest point of summer. However, this highest point is in Cancer. Cancer’s symbol was not the crab, but the Scarab Beetle, Khepera. The stars of Cancer are not visible until December, when the sun is in Capricorn. The ancients saw the stars of Cancer, the Throne of the Sun, in the house of Capricorn. This is, in fact, how Capricorn got its name. Capri is not Goat, but the word Khepera (Khepra-Corn) all really surrounding the imagery of Cancer, the opposite sign. Similarly, the \"Goat-Stars\" were seen in July, so the original symbol of those stars - the Unicorn, became transposed with the house of Cancer. We see this today not as a horned goat, but as the horned horse or Uni corn ., which is common on all Sidereal heraldry. It is really the symbol for Capri corn as is the Beetle Capri/Khepra for Cancer. Since Khepra corn is the opener of the new year, it was said to hold the keys to the door of the zodiac or calendar. This stellar story is encapsulated in nursery rhymes like Jack and Jill , etc,. VATICAN This derives from Vaticinia , or \"Place of Divinations.\" It also has the meaning \"Place of the Sorcerers.\" Underneath St. Peter’s Square there are miles of mazes and catacombs, reportedly, 25 miles of shelves upon which is kept the secret Vatican Library. (All the astronomical telescopes and observatories in the world are funded and controlled by the Vatican). CANNES May derive from the Sanskrit Sannes or Sanis meaning Saturn. May have been a center for Saturn worship. Cannes also may derive from Cann , meaning Serpent.

CALCULATE Comes from the Greek word Kalkuli , which means pebbles, which were used when learning to enumerate. CREATOR Same a Creature, both from the German word Kreator , which meant creature. Creature signifies Nature, not the anthropomorphic God as Creator so familiar from religions. This definition also parallels the Gnostic precept that the god of the religions is in fact the \"Demiurge\" or fallen archon. PARIS From Perisii, or Parisii, meaning - temple of Isis. There was also a place on the Nile river called Paris. The Seine river is the French Nile. The Cult of the Black Madonna is clearly found behind the building in the Notre Dame cathedral and many of the other structures in Paris and other civic centers are from Egypt, see the obelisks, pyramids, sphinxes, gargoyles, towers, gardens and city layouts, etc,. Paris is a strong cultic and occultic center and the sexual libertinism that it is renowned for is not altogether disconnected from this. Other cities like Venice and Vienna get their names from the same Goddess (Isis and Venus are names and expressions of the same deity). PHARAOH Comes from Pharong, meaning the Liberated One. Also from Para , meaning brother. In Hindi the word for brother is also Pra . It is also connected to the term Pharos (fire) meaning light and effulgence. Also Pharos-Nous, or lighted mind. Pharoneus or Pharomeus gives Prometheus, the light-bringer of the later Greeks. The word Farragh, was used in Scotland and Ireland, meaning Chieftain. SACRED As well as sacrifice, sacrament, etc., comes from the Sacer or Zakar, meaning, phallus.

TECHNOLOGY from Tch, meaning serpent. The Egyptian Tec or Tek, meant to find a way around . (Corporate logos, many of them from the silicon companies, feature subliminal references to the serpent motif, for instance, Apple, Teknekron, Nec, Sun, Nikken , AT&T , Intel, CNN, Isuzu, Chevrolet, etc,.) The word may also derive from the Egyptian tekh meaning the heart. Technology could paradoxically mean the \"knowledge of the heart.\" Serpent Symbolism (Cont'd...) As long as humanity kept records of its existence, serpents were used as emblems of the intelligence of God. In ancient times and as widespread and diverse as Australia, China, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Babylonia, Sumeria, Egypt, India, and Central America, serpents were feared and worshipped as gods for thousands of years. If there is a common origin to the mythology of the serpent, it may have developed at the Great Pyramid of Giza. To this day, serpents or dragons signify divine heritage and royalty in many Asian countries, while in the West the serpent represents wisdom and knowledge...Among nearly all ancient peoples the serpent was accepted as the ultimate symbol of wisdom or salvation - Tony Bushby ( The Secret in the Bible ) The founders of Christianity, knew of their indebtedness to the antique Egyptian religions, but knew also that the iconography and customs of the past had either to be customized to suit a biography, or be utterly denigrated. The serpent was the most ambiguous symbol of ancient times and the patriarchs were especially threatened by its intimate connection with the Stellar and Lunar Cults and with the female goddess.

Our land will stand desolate. Tombs and the dead will be its only witnesses - Aesculapius Introduction We wish to reveal, as others have sought to do, that the greatest of all the mythologies, the Christian, is entirely based on the zodiac and the stars. The people that are going to accept this statement are so few in number, that one may wonder at the reason for the work here presented. It is presented in the spirit of true revelation. Our motive is to re-introduce the greatest of all subjects, Astro-Theology and the mystery of the heavens, of the stars, that was the province of the original makers of civilization, the Egyptian Siderealists. Let us be aware of what we actually mean in terms of duration, when we speak of Egypt. The time of Egyptian Stellar Cult was at least 20,000 years B. C. The original dynasties long predate the official dates given in the history books. What Piazzi Smith, Rutherford, Davison, and the other Egyptologist discovered, and what masters such as R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz and Gerald Massey proved, is that the hey day of Egypt was not, as fraudulent modern writers insinuate, the Eighteenth Dynasty, and the time of the rise of monotheism, but was ages before, during the days of the great siderealists, the original builders of the pyramid and sphinx, and cultivators of the Nile Valley. Their god was Set, the Child of Taurt the original Madonna. They existed as far back as the Precessional Ages of Libra, Virgo and Leo. Zodiacally, we are in the Ages which directly oppose these signs. We are, astrologically speaking, \"mirroring\" the ages of the Stellar Cults, which is why there has been revival of interest in the great mysteries of Egypt. This is why prophets like Edgar Cayce predicted that it would be in the present Age of Pisces, that the secret of the Pyramid would again be discovered. What we call \"Egypt\" lasted longer than the later Hellenic, Roman, Byzantine, Medieval, Renaissance, Enlightenment, Industrial, and modern ages put together and multiplied by three. The manipulators of history, therefore, purposely concentrate our attention on the latter days, in order to prevent us delving back into Egypt's past. They do so, understandably, for they have everything to lose once humankind becomes reintroduced to the archive of knowledge and wisdom that was common to our ancestors. This wisdom is encapsulated still in the four high arts of Divination, in Tarot, Astrology, Kabala, and Numerology. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (2 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com In the new millennium there is need to return to the wisdom that was humankind’s in the days of old and move away from the dogma and corruption of orthodoxy which has caused untold horror to the Earth and to the consciousness of human beings. Christian Supplanters By their own admissions and remonstrations, the purveyors of Judeo-Christian theologies concede that there exist \"satanic\" forces preying on the pure. This, they have advocated from their own pulpits and publications for countless generations. Additionally, they have professed themselves to be the enemy and indicter of these malignant agencies. Yet our world has been, and continues to be, debauched by these very self-righteous agents and exponents of orthodox religion. We must conclude that the great Judeo-Christian vanguard has been more than remiss in their crusade against the entities and principalities that they assure us exist. By their own standards of rectitude they are judged impotent and recalcitrant. Sadly few know, or even care to know, the reasons why these religions came to power, or for that matter, how they exercise their power. Those fine commentators on this subject have had their work sequestered and even suffered personal ridicule and injury. However, though the messenger may be destroyed, the message lives eternally: ...there exists...another class of adepts belonging to a brotherhood also and mightier than any other they have to be ranked with the adepts of the Black Arts. These are our Roman Catholic “Fathers” and clergy...

As between a civilization deeply softened by a profound reverence for the assumed presence of deity in the earth, and one dulled to any such sensitivity, one must give the rating to the pagan over the Christian - Alvin Boyd Kuhn ( Ultimate Canon of Knowledge ) The traditional history of Christianity is hopelessly inadequate to the facts. From our research into ancient spirituality it has become obvious that we must fundamentally revise our understanding of Christian origins in the most shocking of ways. Our conclusion, supported by a considerable body of evidence in our book, The Jesus Mysteries, is that Christianity was not a new revelation. It was a continuation of Paganism by another name. The gospel story of Jesus is not the biography of an historical Messiah. It is a Jewish reworking of ancient Pagan myths of the dying and resurrecting Godman Osiris- Dionysus, which had been popular for centuries throughout the ancient Mediterranean - Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy ( The Original Jesus ) We can accept God becoming Man to save Man, but not Man becoming God to save himself - Vernon Howard Conclusion The Bible, that is the Old and New Testaments, was originally an Occult Theology, clandestine and suppressed. It was a consolidation of numerous Asian and Oriental pagan doctrines (Cults). Outside of normal fanaticism, most of its founders and adherents had no intention of it becoming any kind of universal religion. Moreover, the Four Gospels are not a biography of a man. The dramatis personae of the old and new Testaments are not to be taken merely as actual human personalities. They were scripted as such later, when the Israelite and Levite (later Rabbinical) scholars were being hosted by the Romans in the Occident. The Israelites had seen, and may even have participated in, the corruption and fall of the civilizations of Egypt, Babylon, Medea, Persia, Assyria, Greece and Rome. In the heyday of each of these great Semitic civilizations, the Israelites http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (12 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com (themselves Semites), were treated like favored guests, and were not perpetually or vengefully captive, enslaved or persecuted. They learned and developed greatly due to their proximity to the high cultures, and owe much to these hosts, including their language and alphabet. Originally, they were not in any way intellectually or technically endowed. For instance, during their time in Israel, after the so-called \"Exodus\" from Egypt, they had to call in Hyram Abiff and his Phoenician architects to construct the famed Temple of Solomon for them. The Temple was then constructed by the Phoenicians (high Semites) for their skill-less lower caste brethren. Nevertheless, after their protracted, but relatively pleasant stay in Babylon (the so-called \"Captivity\"), and after their ingratiation by the later rulers of the Medo-Persian empire, they succeeded in appropriating, by emulation and outright theft, the wealth of esoteric knowledge which would hold them in good stead down through the successive generations, through the Dark Ages and into modern times. Out of the ashes and ruins of these high cultures, and in order to look exotic and illustrious themselves, the Israelites took the remnants of Stellar theology and philosophy and patched it together in a hideous travesty of what it once was. And one of their main contributions to the canon of falsity was to personify stellar idioms and leitmotifs. They eroticized, sensationalized and de-spiritualized the esoteric significance of the great sidereal myths. Under their hands, the high arts of astrology, tarot, kabala and numerology (all Egyptian) suffered enormous contextual and qualitative desecration. Though the scale and overall impact is hardly the same, the behavior is comparable to the action of groundlings whom, upon exiting the dumb-show before the first act of a Shakespearean Tragedy, then attempt to explain, by grotesque re- inaction, the most profound nuances of the great bard's work. It is comparable to the keeper of the gate-lodge who considers himself both the architect and owner of the mansion.

The finest minds were repeatedly employed and commissioned to round off the edges and make the scriptural nonsense as palatable as could be. More importantly, as their theocratic and political power increased, they sought to impose their lies, by force, upon the rest of mankind.

The state of utter decay in the world presently, and which is found contaminating the minds, emotions, and sexuality of human beings, derives from the tyranny of those \"Scribes and Pharisees\" who, as the fictional Christ is meant to have said in the Book of Matthew , do not enter the kingdom of truth themselves, and who also stand outside on the porch to prevent others from entering. (See Matt 23). Nevertheless, regardless of their zealous contempt for truth, and their inborn penchant for deceit and fabrication, these bearers of false witness have not succeeded in permanently burying the facts. The light of Truth has a strange way of shining through the intellects and imaginations of great men, whose sacrifice, dedication, and love of wisdom has continually saved humankind from calumny. It is from the hearts of such beings that the true light of Christ shines.

C) decided not to return after all to their beloved Jerusalem. Having wined and dined in Babylon, and having been exposed to yet another exotic and cosmopolitan civilization (the Paris of its times), the \"Chosen People,\" were reluctant to make a return to the dust bowl, in Canaan, that they had once called home. As the Old Testament books relate, the ten tribes of the Tribe of David, the House of Israel, decided to follow their prophet Jeremiah westward, across the Caucasus Mountains and into the lands beyond. Only two tribes, those of http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (15 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Benjamin and Levi (House of Judah - the Jews), were still fanatical enough to make a return southward. It is from these two tribes that the Old Testament Yahwistic dogmas of Judaism arises. It is from the exponents and descendants of these two tribes that the Zionist movement of the nineteenth century arise. The greater number of the tribes have long since assimilated with the peoples and tribes of the west. The flags, symbols of state, and the heraldry of almost all the western kingdoms, and nations bear testimony to this, for like the American dollar bill, the symbols are Semitic in origin. Examples of Semitic Symbolism When the ten tribes crossed the Caucasus Mountain ranges, the people of the west referred to them as \"Caucasians.\" This was a generic term and had nothing to do with race. As they moved across Europe, they were called the \"Sons of Isaac.\" This term later became pronounced \"Isaac's Sons,\" and later as \"Saxons.\" Therefore, the fact is that the so-called \"Anglo-Saxon\" races are part Semitic. Hence, the utter idiocy of the white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, and their ken, when they proclaim themselves to be, whatever it is that they proclaim themselves to be. Hence also the idiocy of the Zionist factions, and Jewish zealots, when they flagrantly accuse Gentiles and Anglo-Saxons of being \"Anti- Semitic,\" should one or more of their number stand up and point out Jewish crimes against humanity. The Semitic Race is the largest on the planet. The Phoenicians, Egyptians, Babylonians, Canaanites, Assyrians, Celts, Africans, Arabs, Slavs and the British peoples are largely Semitic. As such, it is preposterous for ordinary Jews (mostly Jewish by religious conversion, and not by racial descent) to benefit and be lionized from the pretense of being the original benefactors of the world's culture. The assimilated House of David has little to nothing to do with the modern religious Jew (a word first used in the 18th Century). Moreover, not a single Jew can possibly trace his ancestry back further than Spain of the Seventeenth Century. Ashkenazi (Yiddish/Hassidic) Jews who make up the largest body of world Jewry (80 percent) are without exception Jews only by religious conversion, and have no blood tie to Israel or the holy land whatsoever. (See The Thirteenth Tribe, by Arthur Koestler, and Controversy of Zion, by Douglas Reed). http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (16 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The United States of America is symbolized by an eagle with arrows and olive branches in its talons.

A term \"Camp David,\" comes from the Israelite symbolic canon, and the famed Irish harp, which appears on Irish flags and coins, etc., is in reality King David's harp. The so-called Shamrock derives not from a plant but from the three interlocking circles seen worn on the robes by visiting Coptic monks and abbots. The \"Red Hand of Ulster\" is connected to Israelite symbolism. The word Tara, is similar to Tyre, the Phoenician capital. The red band worn by the guards at the Tower of London, comes from the red thread tied by the mid-wife around the waist of Jeremiah. The coronation stone, upon which the kings and queens of England are crowned, is reputed to have come to Britain with Jeremiah himself, and be non other than the Bethel Stone upon which Jacob rested when he had his dream of the ladder ascending to heaven. The term \"Reds\" when describing Russia, comes from the Hebrew word Edom, or Edomite, and the kings and queens of England are said to reign as custodians of the House of King David, and be of the \"Seed of David.\" The dove which appears on the maces of the queen of England, and emblazoned on Visa credit cards, is also a reference to the House of David (Doved) whose symbol is the dove. Volumes upon volumes have been penned on this fascinating subject.

The uranograph, or chart of the skies, was incontestably the first of all Bibles, pictorially edited. Not quite simply and patently, but still most luminously for the initiated who held the recondite keys to the symbolic lexicon of ancient writing, it can be affirmed that all Bibles are but amplifications and elaborations of the original volume of ideography that was first written on the open slate of the sky, then charted in the zodiac and the planispheres carved on the ceilings of ancient temples and later transferred to earth and inscribed in scrolls, tablets and parchments.

We concentrate here, however, on the Judeo-Christian ethos as it is the one familiar to most persons in the West and because it constitutes the most pernicious form of psychic dictatorship that subjugates the reason and character of human beings. We concentrate on Christianity because we know that its own very origins are to be found in the Hermetic (later Gnostic) and Magickal traditions of antiquity. The modern form which has enslaved the masses for millennia, is an exoteric concoction, a debauched and unnecessarily contorted simulacra, which needs to be dispensed with forthwith. Beneath its crumbling edifice has always flowed the true teachings, those never conferred on the many, or on the unworthy: There was always an exoteric portion given out to the world, to the uninitiated, and an esoteric portion reserved for the initiates, and revealed only in degrees, accordingly as the candidate demonstrated his fitness to receive, conceal and rightly use the knowledge so imparted.

Now, we again find that in the New Testament there are 4 Gospels. There are several reasons for this and one of the main ones has to do with Astro-Theology. The four Gospels are representations of the four cardinal points of the zodiac! And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years - (Genesis 1:14) http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (20 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The Gospels are not a biography The original authors had no intention of making their book into a biography and never for a moment intended it to be one. They were merely rewriting the oldest story in the world, that of the zodiac. They never dreamt that a cabal of megalomaniac and perverse patriarchs would attempt to corrupt the story by personification. The 4 gospels do not work as a biography. If it was meant to be one, the authors would have done a better job of it, after all, there are only four of them. Even after years of doctoring and pious commentary it still doesn’t make sense as the biography of an individual. Actually, as will be shown it is a great work on propaganda, that was originally a compilation of tales regarding the orbit and adventures of the sun through the zodiac. Does this threaten ones spirituality? Does the pronouncement upset all one holds dear? If it does it is because all that we think is spiritual today is utterly false. We have moved so far away from what is real that we cannot even see the truth of this. That is what this web-site is all about. The real Christ, or Moses, or John the Baptist were sidereal astrologers instructing their students in the great mysteries of the sky. And atheism has nothing to do with it. If one has read through the Taroscopes Tour it will be recalled that the external zodiac got to be external because it was a constellation of archetypes within the consciousness of man first. By projection and inflation, the human consciousness turned the contents of itself out into the external. All the myths mention this in various ways. Blake’s Albion falling through the abyss and breaking asunder on the rocks of matter, the Biblical \"fall\" of the primal parents, in the Kabala we have the descent of Adam Kad Amon, in Egypt the vomiting forth from the mouth of the gods, in Greece the \"masturbatory\" action of the Titan creators like Zeus, etc., are all ways of describing this act of consciousness, emptying forth its inner template to the world. Emmanuel Kant proved it in his philosophy as did others within the discipline of metaphysics. The contents of human consciousness can be expressed in mathematical terms. The mind is fourfold and from these 4 come 7, 10 and 12, numbers which are found absolutely everywhere. Now, since it is proven that the external zodiac is the analogue of the consciousness of man, we can understand that there is complete authenticity in the ancients studying it and using it as a means to an end in the tuition of the novice in the great mysteries http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (21 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com of Being, which are the mysteries of God. And this truth, has been carefully concealed from the masses for centuries. We are walking, breathing zodiacs. The zodiac is in us, so are the 12 houses and 7 planets, (or what they represent archetypally). Our ego-consciousness is the inner sun that must pass through the halls of the 12 judges, must matriculate, must perfect itself. And this cannot be done in surrogate. Each must go through their own journey. The triumph of all religions lies in their ability to convince us all of the opposite: that some personality outside of ourselves, separated from us personally, by millennia, has done it all, or will do it all for us. The orthodox created the external model that has done it all for us, taking away the responsibility for our own actions, in clever ways. And we fell for it. The religious teaching presented in Paul’s Epistles is fundamentally different from what research has recognized as being authentic sayings of Jesus... What we know as Christianity today is not the teaching contained in these authentic sayings; it is the theology disseminated by Paul and the doctorers of his Epistles - Elmer H.

Behind these views is an ancient doctrine that has existed from the beginning - Celsus The Real Crucifixion We handed our spiritual evolution to the powers that be and are now divorced from the sacred oracle within. The goal of true religion or theology, is to return one to the understanding that one cannot find god, one becomes god, that is enlightened, to the truth of ourselves and the living ambient universe. Enlightenment is the awakening to the understanding that the law of reciprocity means that all division and separation is illusion. ALL IS SELF and SELF IS ALL. This cannot be accomplished without integration of all Four aspects of inner consciousness. And this is the mystery concealed in the very first Tarot card - Magician , as well as others. The Gnostics said: when the 2 + 2 = 1 then shall the Christ be born in you . The Tarot is one of the means of actualizing this state. As said before, Tarot is the Book of Life and not a dogmatic scripture. The Bible is an outgrowth of the Torah, but the Torah is an outgrowth of the Tarot, in fact they are the same word, meaning Law, or Way, same as Tao. There are many mysteries encapsulated in the Tarot and the zodiac and few modern researchers have touched on them. We intend to correct this. The 4 Types have always been symbolized by the 4 elements, Fire, Water, Air and Earth, or as in Tarot: Wands, Cups, Swords, Disks , or in playing cards, Clubs, Hearts, Spades and Diamonds . There are innumerable other figurative replications of these 4 Types. If one examines closely, the cards of the Major Arcana, especially The Magician and The Universe they will see this supernal motif pictorialized. It is a wonder that this motif has been ignored completely by so called Tarot scholars, as the uniting of the four modalities is the central precept of all Gnosticism and Magick. This neglect emphasizes what we mean when we say that there is an exoteric and an esoteric approach to the mysteries. Many there are who can teach ancient subjects, but very few who can teach them in the ancient way. In our times we can have medical professionals displaying the Hermetic Caduceus (serpent staff) without practicing Hermetically, And we find so-called \"astrologers\" who know not what, or where, the stars really are.

Though Christ a thousand times in Bethlehem be born, But not within thyself, thy soul will be forlorn; The cross on Golgotha thou lookest to in vain, Unless within thyself it be set up again - Angelus Silesius And one of them that has been staring us all in the face for centuries is the Four Gospels. They too represent the four elements. See if you agree: Back THE REAL FOUR GOSPELS The four principal festivals of the solar worship celebrated in the northern hemisphere were the spring or vernal equinox, the summer solstice, the autumnal equinox, and the winter solstice. Their observance can be traced to the remotest period of history or tradition and belongs to every nation and every wide-spread religion of which we have any knowledge - Alexander Del Mar The Book of Mark This is the Book of Mars . Mark comes from Martian or Mars. As we said the disguises are rather thin, because it was originally never meant to be too cryptic. It was the same as so many other stories that are common all over the planet and which are autonomous creations of the human being as he seeks to comprehend the enigmas of existence. Mars was a well known planet and archetype. It is the ruler of the sign Aries. So the Book of Mark is, in zodiacal terms, the BOOK OF ARIES . And this makes perfect sense as Aries is the first house of the zodiac and is the place of rising of the sun at Easter or at the spring equinox. We even get terms like \"arise and shine,\" from the Aries house, as this is literally were the orb of day does arise and shine. The house of \"arising\" is Aries. Aries is in the month of April.

This is because April opens the year. Aries is the sign that is ruled by the Ram. In Christian art we see one of the 4 Evangelists symbolized by a Bull. This is also to do with Mark/Aries, because both Aries and Taurus are constellations or houses on the Eastern horizon. They are the eastern signs always seen in the sky together. And in ages past the symbols connected to both these signs were very pervasive and important. Christ is often depicted carrying a lamb, or in nativity scenes, a small lamb is often seen. The Book of Luke This is also transparent to those who have done their homework. Luke is Latin for Lucius and both words mean Light. The House of Light, of Lucius is Leo, the domicile or natal house of the sun. This is the BOOK OF LEO . The sun rises to its astrological throne in the signs of Cancer and Leo in the Northern sky, during the months of July and August. In Celtic Ireland the name Leo was Lugh , another solar hero and mystic. In Wales he was Llew , to the Romans Lugus , to the Sumerians Lughal . Its not the same dude on walkabout, it’s the Astrological sign of Leo. In the Christian iconography we have one of the Evangelists represented by a Lion. In the Nativity scenes we see 4 animals around the cradle of the Son/Sun king. One of these is also a Lion. Christians probably believe that there was one in the area and just happened to wander into the inn to take a peek at sleeping Jesus. Good thing it wasn’t very hungry. Christ is often termed the \"Lion of Judaea.\" Book of Matthew This is more adroitly concealed. But those who are aware of the theocracy of Egypt can recognize the word Matt . This gives Maat, the supreme Goddess of the ancient Egyptians. Maat is pronounced Mayat . She is the Mahat of the Brahmins, the Meath of the Celts, the Tiamat of the Skalds, the Maia of the Romans and the Mara of the pagans. Maat is always symbolized by the Scales of Justice, which, in turn relate with the western sign of Libra. So this is the BOOK OF LIBRA . Now in the Bible, we read that Matthew was the disciple that the other 11 did not want to accept. The reason for this was that he was a tax-collector, (perfidious company in any age). However behind all the hyperbole, we have a secret concealed. The symbol of the tax- collectors has always been the scales or balances. This is because they did not only want currency, but they took grain and livestock also. And their lackeys would carry large scales around. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (25 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com It is the same today in rural, eastern communities. Astrologically, Maat and her scales are connected with the western sign of Libra, which directly faces the signs of Aries and Taurus. Libra was also the last sign to be officially added to the codified zodiac, although it was known long before. This is why we hear that Matthew was the last to join the 12. That is right astrologically. It doesn’t make any other sense. Why would spiritually inclined disciples of a spiritual master, attracted to him and his teachings because of the ethics of brotherhood, compassion and love, suddenly show chagrin towards a potential addition to their company? In Christian iconography we see one of the Evangelists symbolized by an Eagle. Astrologically, this is Matthew. One of the most important constellations in the western sky (actually in the modern Scorpio), is Aquila-the Eagle. Libra was a sign made out of part of Scorpio. The word Matthew, also comes from Matt-Theos . The Book of John This is abstract until we understand that John comes from Jahan or Jahn , which comes from the earlier Ionnes , Oannes (the Fish god). Jahan or J ahn gives us other names, like Jane, Joan, Janus and even Jasus or Jesus. It eventually gives us the word Jahnuary or January . This is the month that corresponds with the sign of Aquarius. Aquarius is the southern sign, symbolized by a man carrying a water pitcher from which water is flowing. This is why we have the biblical character John the Baptist, the initiator of Jesus. It is all a symbol for this important sign. Now the Book of John stands for the Book of January or BOOK OF AQUARIUS . In art we see a figure of the Angel or Man. This stands for John and Aquarius. Now naturally the orthodox have attributed these animals to the wrong Evangelists, so to further conceal things. January comes to represent this time of the year because of the opening of the secular and agricultural year. Janus was the \"double-faced,\" god. During January (Aquarius), the Nile waters were the purist, so the Egyptians would collect it for use in telestic rites. The sign of Aquarius became associated with baptism, cleansing and purification by water. This was borrowed by the Israelites and finds its way into the Christian traditions. So now we see the gospels clearly detailed as signs of the zodiac. The sun-king must pass through these signs. They are his \"chroniclers\" ( chron means time specifically relating to the round of the zodiac). They are his measurers, his \"Apostles\" (post means demarcation post, a colure of the zodiac).

Egypt was known by alien nations as the “Land of the Tree and the Serpent.” This relates to mysteries of the body, the Kabala, to Androgyny and the meta-sexual mysteries. It refers to the magical, serpentine staff called the Caduceus of Hermes, borrowed as a symbol by today’s medical professions. It is the country were one was sent to learn these and other great mysteries, as Aristotle, Plato, Pythagoras, Solon, Xeres, Ammious Saccas, Hippocrates, Ovid, Apollonius, Iamblichus, Isocrates, Porphyrius, Plutarch, Diodorus, Diogenes, Euxodos, Thales, Plotinus, Porphyry, Herodotus and so many other scholars from through out the world would readily have verified. Theology, Theurgy and Divination were in the hands of the female in ancient times. The Priestesses were the initiators. There was much knowledge there concerning the biology of the human body. During the early period of the Christian movement the multitude of often contradictory texts was so great that the young Church saw only one way of preserving the faith from splitting into numerous sects: assembling a canon of writings and destroying rejected apocryphal (hidden) texts - Elmer H.

Her fruits are the circular ovum. Conception was fascinating to the Egyptians, not because they were sex mad, but because they understood that the meeting of the male force and the female force allows the miracle of incarnate life to occur, it is the way a soul enters physical creation. We take this for granted and never see the mystery of it. But the ancients considered this of paramount importance and saw the magic in it. And since the female is the host and incubator of that soul, the living alembic of this supreme Alchemical act, she was revered and deified. One of the other names for the Goddess was Nuith or Nut. She was also a mother goddess and identified with the Tree of Life . This is why today we still refer to the fruits of any tree as the \"nuts\" meaning of the goddess Nut. In ancient papyrus art we see a tree and actually one with it we often see a goddess, like Nut or Isis or Hathor, etc,. They show that the tree and goddess are one being. In the Middle Ages we see in tapestries, the Madonna seated and behind her the Tree of Life . Now the story of the Tree of Life and all its connotations was called, in Egypt, the Book of Genesis or Gen isis . Isis was the supreme mother goddess of Egypt, after acceptance of the Osirian mythos. Genesis means \"genes of Isis,\" or even \"generation (progeny), of Isis.\" This referred to the physical female and of the cosmic female, the Universe itself. The Egyptians saw themselves as the offspring of one cosmic mother and her name was Isis. Isis is the later Eve and Mary, the virgin queens. The Book of Genesi s is therefore a book of genes, relating to the human DNA (the real Tree of Life ). \"Biting the Apple\" Now we come to the part in the adapted Book of Genesis were the primal parents are tempted by the evil serpent and are outlawed from paradise forever. No one has ever come up with a reason for the strange prohibition mentioned or the subsequent wrath of the creator in regards his own creations. We can now state clearly that the reason why no explanations are given regarding anything in Genesis is because their adapted and interpolated story is patently concocted and false. Explanations are meant to cast aside ignorance and show the rationale for a thing. How can one explain a pack of lies. It is a hash of a sacred initiation story that was learned by the novices in the sanctums and palmyriums of ancient Mediterranean peoples. The subversion of this act was to disempower the female and http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (29 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com marginalize womankind from the coming institutionalized religious cabals that would enslave humankind and pervert all the sacred tracts and rituals. But behind the graffiti we can find again the original message, the original intent of the ancients. Now as we pointed out the female’s ovum were called the \"apples,\" from the Tree of Life . But what of the sperm from the male, without which there can be no life. The sperm was long equated with and symbolized by a wriggling snake or serpent. Once this is known, it will help to explain numerous carvings and images found in the ancient temples of serpents shown in close approximation to circular orbs and symbols. How many have seen the cobra motif crowned by a circular disc? Now the sperm does attempt to enter the ovum and circles all around it. This was depicted as a serpent coiling around an apple, or a tree. So in the Bible we have the serpent tempting and an apple that is called the Fruit of the Tree of the “knowledge of good and evil.” This tree does not exist in any place but the minds of the biblical authors, attempting to draw attention away from the tree as a female symbol. We need to substitute \"male and female\" or \"masculine and feminine\" for \"good and evil,\" to get back on track. The serpent and the apple were symbols of the sperm and the ovum . The \"biting of the apple\" was always a connotation for the sperm entering the ovum. Its action of penetration was seen figuratively as \"biting\" into the apple. An apple cannot be replaced once it has been plucked, as the sperm cannot be deviated or returned upon entering the ovum. The term \"rotten apple\" was and still is, used to ridicule a recidivist child. When the prohibition states not to bite the apple, is a prohibition against conception, not given by the ancients, but by later church patriarchs with an agenda of dividing masculine from feminine, (the goal of all true mysticism and religion is the opposite) and male from female. There can be no rule or domination over the consciousness of man unless there is first rule over the biology of man. There could be no authority structures of any kind without prohibition and punishment. Freud proved that humans literally embody the patriarchal model. We even identify with the oppressor if that force is powerful and threatening to our personal security and well- being. Circumcision (the mark of servitude) Religion had in mind the idea of turning man’s awareness away from himself and his innate, natural wisdom, to the external realm http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (30 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com of change and transition. It also had in mind the need to convince man to repress his own vital energies, the libido and the sexuality. To do this they instigated and reinforced the pagan tradition of circumcision, employing it in their liturgy as a \"holy\" ceremony. The pagan custom was never holy and it had potentially very negative connotations, of great interest and attraction to these conceivers of the Solar-centric, phallocratic theocracies. Taking a circlet of skin from the male, from his penis had the symbolism of removing the feminine principle from him. Circles, as shown above, were always analogous to the ovum and since the ancients recognized that the penis was the symbol of man, cutting from there, served to symbolically reinforce his manhood/ masculinity, to emphasize the polarity of the genders. When women had to undergo the circumcision of the clitoris, this was the removal of the small \"penis\" from her, the polarization of her maleness and the hardening of the femaleness. The emphasis in both these barbaric and demeaning, but ever so \"sacred\" rituals, was the polarization of the sexes, not their union. Now this is not the role of true religion. True religion makes each sex realize the essential bi-unity of its nature, on a psychological level. Orthodoxy could have none of that. They wanted man to repress his instincts so that they could provide all the sexual repressions in vicarious forms later on, in their intricate ecclesiastical rituals and convocations. The architecture of the churches and cathedrals, the regalia and attire are all surrogate sexual symbols. Sexual imagery has become sacred imagery. You cannot have someone repress their natural instincts and desires without coveting neurosis and schizophrenia (split personality). A certain amount of disassociation is necessary for the control, but too much defeats the purpose. They want us inwardly divided alright, but also aspiring systemically for that lost equipoise. So they cleverly provide the erotica, cloaked in esoterica. This is why even in modern times we have the bizarre fetishism of sexual personae. We are not allowed to know about androgyny in all its permutations. But we can have a Christ figure placed before us, cosmetically made-over to look typically androgynous. And as many have shown, Christian Art is saturated with veiled erotic depictions (see Camille Paglia and George Bataille, etc). \"Bruising the Head and Heel\" When we hear that the head of the serpent will be \"bruised,\" we are also hearing about the breaking of the head of the sperm as it enters the ovum. As the single sperm penetrates the precinct of http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (31 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com the female ovum, its head breaks off (see the Tower Tarot card). \"Enmity\" And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between they seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and then shalt bruise thy heel - (Genesis 3:15) When we hear that there will be \"enmity\" placed between the woman and the man we must, instead, read \"polarity.\" Naturally, in conception there are two sexes. But as explained above, the Church Fathers wanted to emphasize the dichotomies between man and woman. It is simple divide to rule tactics but with massive political and spiritual connotations. There has been an overt war against the role of the female in physical life. There is also the war for the suppression of the Feminine, or Anima, within the consciousness of humankind. The Anima is the supreme archetype and gives life its mystery and meaning. It is the cosmic female that gave life to all that exists. Church religion wanted to cut us off at the root and judging by the record of horrors executed under the auspices of all fundamental religion, it has certainly succeeded. The present schisms between the sexes is a symptom of the inner systemic and psychic duality. The sexual act and everything sexual had to be made taboo. Sexuality, even on the lower genital level, calls for unison and bonding. In emotion behind all sexual union, especially the highest manifestation of it, is the loss of personal identity and gender dichotomy. Object and subject are obliterated, transcended. Through sexual experience the Male is meant to be introduced to his inner Female. Likewise the female is meant to be introduced to her inner male. And ultimately this calls for the complete transcendence of these illusions. And in ancient Hermetic traditions, the Priestess was the being that preserved and expounded the articles and precepts of this faith (Hermes was the Grecian version of the Egyptian Thoth and this latter is always described as an agent of the goddess. Hermetic traditions are Goddess traditions and it is just a play on words that would make it seem otherwise). Moreover, if we have potentates dressing as the female and referring to “Holy Mother Church” we realize now that it is all a vestige of a rich, meaningful metaphysic. Androgyny http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (32 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The \"biting of the apple\" is a hermeneutic for the sperm/serpent, entering the ovum at the moment of conception. But this elaborate and evocative story of the garden of Eden was not only about the sexual biology we are all versed in. It contained deeper motifs, relating to Androgyny and the union of the energies of the Shiva and Shakti, Osiris and Isis, Adam and Eve, Guinevere and Arthur, etc,. In the myth of Osiris we find him cut into 15 pieces. This is because there are 15 joints to the male body, 14 for the Female. (14 + 15 = 29 = 11 - JUSTICE , the Libran card of the marriage of opposites. 11 is one and one or the meeting of the opposites in the Chymical Marriage or Hieros Gamos ). The moon’s cycle is complete after 29 days. The Pharaoh is always seen with his arms crossed over his breast. This is not a symbol of death. Actually, when the right arm (male) crosses the left side and the left arm (female) crosses the right side we have a symbol for bi-unity or Androgyny. Moreover, the \"Crook and the Flail\" symbols that he carries also represent, among other things, the ovum and sperm again. Our number 9 came from the symbol of the sperm which must enter the female ovum, which is why we have the number 10. The curved number 9 has that design to represent the male phallic 1 returning to, or becoming the circle or zero. Male returning from whence it came. There is a Gnostic/Pythagorean adage that states: The circle doth beget the line, but the line begetteth not a circle. It should be obvious now what this means. In magic the protecting circle is commonly of 9 feet (cubits) in diameter. The \"squaring the circle\" motif is common in most city architecture. One must become familiar with the concept of Androgyny and how the ancients were concerned with it. Little that is contained in world myth, legend and lore is going to make much sense unless one is conversant with Androgyny. The entire Alchemical \"Magnum Opus\" deals with it explicitly. The Magickal Circle and Pentagram We can also see the motif of the ovum and sperm in the image, coming down to us out of the past, of the Magician standing in his protecting circle, often with a pentacle design there also. Christians point to this as satanic. However, as shown above, for anyone that does not know it, conception occurs when the male sperm enters into the female ovum. This latter is the precinct of http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (33 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com life itself, the sacred alembic of all advanced animal life. The fetus takes shape, then shape-shifts, goes through magical metamorphosis, grows and becomes human, all within, or from, the protection of its little circle. So when the Magician, whose intent it is to rise to the fifth spiritual dimension (the Quintessence), stands within his circle he is attempting merely to emulate the original acts of conception and birth. His living body replicates the male sperm within the female ovum. He may even hold a wand or staff to emphasize that fact. In magic the circle is frequently designed according to the number 9 and its factors. The word nine comes the word nun which meant \"primordial ocean.\" It was also the name of the original mother goddess from Egypt. The number 9 connotes the female gestative cycle, but also represents the phallic yod . or number 1 returning to the shape of the circle. The pentagram is the symbol that is seen in all naturally flowering things. It is another symbol of the female and the Mother (Venus). It is connected to the Phi ratio (creation ratio), which is why we see Leonardo, Vitruvius and Agrippa depicting man standing in that shape. All things grow according to the pentad and its various harmonics. It represents the fifth level of cognition, or human evolution and there is nothing \"satanic\" about it. But since it all related to the female initiatory precepts, it had no place and no currency in the Solar and Saturnian power cults that superceded the Stellar and Lunar epochs. (Incidentally this is the reason why the letter Greek letter for Phi is a circle and a line, similar to the English \"Q\"). The Magician is the one who deems it the object of life to attain the fifth dimension. The first four are the mineral, vegetable, animal and human kingdoms. The Magician wishes to undergo the great metamorphosis and attain the \"Meta-Human,\" or \"Pharaonic\" level, which is that of the true Christ (karast). This metamorphosis is akin to a rebirth and so there is need to employ the symbols commensurate with an act of birth namely, the \"Ring and the Rod.\" This is also why we see the female pentagram and the protecting precinct of the circle in all Magical depictions. Unfortunately, the modern practitioners of ceremonial magic have not the faintest idea of any of this and the Christians, who know just as little, continue their dialectical rankling and scare tactics. The latter are reacting against the wrong symbols and the former are trying to revere symbols that have nothing to do with their main tenets. All the while the power elite are dancing on their desks enjoying the entire spectacle. The reason why the http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (34 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com pentagram gets shown with a goat’s head has also nothing to do with Satan or Satan worship. The word goat comes from the word gott which is god in Anglo-Saxon. This is because the symbol for god for millennia was either a horned goat, or other horned, vegetarian, non-pack, animal. (See L. A. Waddell and Harold Bailey, etc). Actual \"Satanists,\" who are some of the stupidest people on the earth (and they have stiff competition for this merit), often adopt the upright goat’s head as their symbol proving that, like Christians, they are in total ignorance as to the nature of telestic mysteries. To really show \"opposition\" to the Christian God and ethos the real \"anti-Christian\" would reverse or invert the image of the goat’s (God’s) head. (It was reversed not the pentacle. An inverted pentacle has no negative meaning at all. It merely means that one is turning to the world within themselves rather that the outer world. Of course, this is seen as evil to all the orthodox minions who are fixated on the external and exoteric. The main reason why the reversed pentagram is seen at all in magic has to do with the Egyptian Kabala. In Kabala the fifth sefirot Geburah is associated with Mars and, therefore, with masculinity, aggression and evil, the fall of spirit into matter. It represents the place of the Fall and also the place of the adversary. (This is the reason why the US Pentagon is that shape). Now inverting the symbol of he five indicates a subversion of this same \"Yang\" energy and the exaltation of the feminine \"Yin\" principles, the return of spirit to the supernal realms. There is nothing evil in any of this for a truly spiritual person. Outside the strict Kabalistic milieu the pentagram came to represent nature and the creative force of sexuality (Eros) the ever extending physical impulse and libido which is often needed to be internalized (reversed) by the mystic savant who realizes that there is more to life than procreation, furtherance of life in the external sense and infatuation with the material illusion. The mystic by definition does not desire to participate in the erstwhile progress of the material flux which prizes species over individual. The fifth card of the Tarot is the patriarchal Hierophant, representing orthodox approaches to religion and belief. He is the creator of dogma and is suppressive to anything which contradicts his hegemony. He represents the Church and the Inquisition, and the forces which conspire to have men and women conform to a fixed pattern of understanding. The reversed pentagram is in this context, therefore, a symbol of the rebellion against such http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (35 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com conformity and hierarchical dominance. It is the sign of the outcast, and subversive - the Gnostic and Taoist who values individuality and who knows that what we believe cannot be imposed on others, or enforced by subliminally implanted fallacies about the nature of god, however ingeniously manufactured. (To read more about the Hierophant card, click here). A pentagram also stands with 2 feet on the ground and three above. In Kabalistic symbology, this represents the marriage of Chokmah (masculine) and Binah (Feminine). However, the five points can clearly be connected with the five senses. The two points represent the two senses that rank higher that the others in a spiritual context. These are seeing and hearing. Upon these the other senses are dependant. Seeing and hearing are senses that are very different and one must understand their essential nature in order to progress spiritually. The Misuse of the Pentagram The Semites and Greeks would inscribe, around the points of a pentagram, the letters for the word Hygiene. For them, however, this word did not refer merely to physical cleanliness and a repressed or inhibited life. To mystery school initiates the five- pointed star was a symbol of moral excellence and spiritual perfection. The Pentagram was therefore the device worn by those with unsullied souls, the truly blessed ones. Additionally, because of its esoteric connection with the planet-archetype Venus, it was known and recognized as an emblem of health and healing. It reversal, in this context, would represent toxicity and sickness, evil and moral degeneracy. So-called \"true\" Satanist would never use a reversed pentacle is because they too are, in fact, spiritualists, and like their nemesis also seek the perfection of the \"Fifth Element\" or Quintessence. All mystics and magicians are attempting in their work to reach this stage. That is why the pentacle and the circle are utilized. Leonardo Da Vinci even depicted Man in formation as a pentacle to highlight this telestic theme, that he too, being an Alchemist was involved in reaching. So given the actuality of these facts, that regardless of whether the Magician is \"black\" or \"white\" the goal is the same, neither practitioner would invert the pentacle. To do so would be to affirm that the practitioner was interested, not in evolution of consciousness, but rather devolution to a lower state, that of animal, vegetative or even inorganic life. Naturally, this http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (36 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com cannot be the intention of anyone, let alone of those whose entire motive is the augmentation of their personal power. Now the \"lower\" Satanist who does unwittingly use the reversed pentagram will never attain his desired goal and is, in fact, in severe danger of self-destruction. Taking all he knows about magic from the grimoires and lexicons of the Middle Ages, the befuddled fabrications of monks and witch-hunters, he engages in rites of futility. He aspires to the fifth dimension, thinking like all megalomaniacs that the state can be artificially actualized, but employs a symbol that means the exact opposite of his intention. Hell certainly awaits for such a fool. He becomes possessed or regresses to the lower ontological states. In his own words, something goes \"disastrously wrong\" and he is visited by all manner of entities resembling insects, animals, serpents, dragons and other hybrid creatures. Not that there is anything inherently evil in these apparitions. They are just the representations of, or familiars of, the realms that he has been unwittingly contacting and are probably as unhappy to see him as he is to see them. It will one day be found out who has been funding all the exploitative \"horror\" movies, not only those from the classic black and white days, but the more recent blood and gore ones, like \"The Omen,\" \"The Exorcist,\" \"Halloween, \"Friday the 13th,\" etc,. It is the Vatican, for they have much to gain from reinforcing our idea of evil and their redemptive role as public saviors from it all. On a more mundane level, if one does use a reversed pentacle they may be merely saying that they do not believe in the path of the religions or even of the magician, as a means of contacting reality or fostering soul advancement. In Masonic conclaves the upright pentagram or pentacle placed on anything signifies that the item is transmuted to the mystical level. (This is not done for positive reasons though but because of large scale rituals that the top Freemasons are involved in). It is a sigil that like an exclamation mark or apostrophe, signals that there are subliminally arcane meanings behind the seemingly mundane appearance. (This is why the pentagram is on national flags and heraldry, why they are worn by those in the military, why the US Pentagon is that shape and why even the hellish machines of war and death bare the symbol.) http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (37 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com When found in a text, the star determined (or indicated to the reader) that the group of hieroglyphs associated with it was related to spiritual matters.

But because Satanists do ignorantly use some as such Christians are right to feel wary and critical. They should, however, make a more in-depth study of symbols to know exactly what is consciously malign. Factually, a symbol can only become a sigil for negative energy when its modal regularity (shape), that is, its vertices, are warped, distended or reconfigured in any way so that one side is of a different length than the others, or of all different lengths. Actions like that will corrupt the mathematical and geometric/geomantic calibration of a symbol and certainly make it a conduit for dissonant energies. It is beyond question that the great ancient design of the zodiac is a wondrously conceived graph aimed to depict the structure of the Logos, the pattern or creative evolution, the essential constitution of the universe and the course of the current of life in the cosmos, and by analogy in man the microcosmic replica of the macrocosm. Almost infinite nuances of significance have been adumbrated in those twelve signs or houses of the zodiac and the thirty-six other constellations, as well as in the semantic pictorializations which ancient sagacity and an ingenuity born of a sapient understanding of the profounder truth of life conceived and drew around those star clusters in the heavens. The uranograph, or chart of the skies, was incontestably the first of all Bibles, pictorially edited. Not quite simply and patently, but still most luminously for the initiated who held the recondite keys to the symbolic lexicon of ancient writing, it can be affirmed that all Bibles are but amplifications and elaborations of the original volume of ideography that was first written on the open slate of the sky, then charted in the zodiac and the planispheres carved on the ceilings of ancient temples and later transferred to earth and inscribed in scrolls, tablets and parchments.

The male column and the circular fountain of life-giving waters were a common fixture to city centers, because they represent fertility and abundance. The obelisk represented the phallus of the earth god Geb, whose erect member extends into the body of the goddess of the heavens, his consort, Nuith. The Masons that were the architects of the temple structures and who knew all about the measurements of the planet, place the capital \"G\" within the symbols of the calipers (compass) and ruler. The word Geb probably gave rise to the Greek \"Geo\" meaning Earth, hence - geo metry, geo mancy, etc,. Circles represent the ovum. This is why we see modern conjurors holding a straight wand and a circular ring. Sometimes we see a hat, from which the magician pulls endless paraphernalia and living animals. The ring or the hat represent the ever-teeming womb that is fertilized by the inseminating wand, the phallus. When we get married the ritual includes the placing of a ring on a straight finger, as a symbol of union and coming fertility. In Jewish traditions a circle is drawn around a pregnant woman during the birth hours. During the Catholic Mass, one has a small, white, circular wafer, placed in their mouths. This action of imbibing and ingestion is subliminally based on the relationship, again, to the mother. The circle of the Mass represents the Ovum. In circumcision, a small circlet of skin is removed from the male phallus. This represents the removal under pain, of the female principle. This is why at this time, a boy is said to become a 'man.' http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (39 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Roman ambassadors would draw a circle around themselves in the earth prior to delivering their counsels, this was to indicate their neutrality.

In Washington DC we have the phallic \"Monument\" facing the female \"Oval\" office. In Paris we find another obelisk in front of the Notre Dame (\"Virgin\" Mary’s) Cathedral. All ancient Celtic passage graves have the standing stone aligned with circular mounds called sidhes, which means \"breast\" or \"womb.\" Silbury Hill in England turns out to be a huge spirallic womb, when seen from the air. Glastonbury Tor (a phallic tower) is nearby. Get the picture? (interested readers can see the Etymology section above and look under the word Genesis ). Jesus and the Twelve There can be no doubt that the story of Jesus and the twelve derive from the Sun and the signs of the zodiac. However there is another corollary that concerns the mystery of generation, conception and mitosis. It has been noticed that it takes one sperm to enter an ovum for conception to take place. However, now with the new microscopes it has been found there are certain preliminaries that occur for this sperm to even gain entrance. Thousands of sperms must circulate the outer wall of the ovum and then 12 sperms must line up against the wall in an extremely geometric manner. Only when this is just right will the ovum and the pronucleus allow one sperm usually the 13th through. Cannot the coming to earth of Jesus and the gaining of the 12 disciples correlate with this microcosmic mystery? In several Catholic paintings we often see the 12 disciples and sometimes Christ himself all enswathed in the blue veil of Mary, in a manner that definitely replicates the above mentioned scenario. In almost all if the hero myths of the world we have the twelve companions. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (40 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Back Astro-Theology and the Bible (cont'd...) The Twelve Ages or Aeons Many of the anecdotes and stories in New Testament have to do with the astronomical phenomena called 'The \"Precession of the Equinoxes.\" This is the movement of the constellations relative to the motion of the Earth. There are three basic celestial motions that concerned the ancients and that were symbolized by three circles, a motif seen on religious architecture, etc,. There is the motion of the Earth around the Sun, there is the motion or orbit of the Earth on its own axis and there is the \"wobble\" motion of the planet Earth as it turns on its own axis. This latter motion is the one that makes it appear as if the point of the Equinoxes are moving backwards in relation to the fixed astrological houses. Now this motion may not seem worthy of attention to most readers. However, we cannot emphasize it enough as the 'Precession' is the heart of all mythology, symbolism and religion. One cannot have astrology without it. It is the secret of all magical, Hermetic traditions and volumes can be and have been written on it, few which are in print today. Even the humble nursery rhymes descend from it. Jack and Jill, Humpty Dumpty, Goosy Goosy Gander, Old Mother Hubbard , etc., all contain cryptic sabean motifs. The zodiac is of twelve houses. It takes 72 years for the zodiac to move \"backwards\" just one degree of arc. This means that it takes 2,160 years for the sun to pass through one sign of the zodiac of 30 degrees. And for all twelve signs it takes 25,920 years. This is called the Platonic Year or the Grand Cycle. Then 4 of these Great Ages also constitutes a Cycle that is spoken of in the ancient records. But the astrologers knew that there are many changes in the evolution of the Earth when the sun passes into another house. And while the Equinox was being measured to see which constellations were opening the year, the wobble itself made the pole axis point to a different star in the northern sky. This is another important cycle that lasts 3,700 years. There are seven major \"stations\" of the Pole that were known. This gave rise to euphemisms in religion and mythology such as the 7 candlesticks that the \"Son\" (sun) passes through, the hall of the 7 chambers, the 7 crowns, the 7 magi, the 7 sleepers, the 7 jackals, the 7 gates, the 7 challenges, the 7 http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (41 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com hurdles, etc, etc,. The Pole of the earth is euphemistically called the Rock of Ages, in the Bible. The Pole was connected to stability. Plinths, columns, lecterns and podiums, etc., represent this Pole, as does the staff that the \"wise\" are seen carrying. For a zodiac age to change meant that a new constellation was seen at dawn on the 21 March or the Spring Equinox. When the Pyramid was built the sign of Virgo was at this point. When the Mystery Schools opened on the Nile, the constellation of Leo was there. When the Priestarchies dominated, it was the Age of Taurus. During the Age of Aries, the male god was worshipped and there was war and conquest in the world. As each age changes, those sages in charge of the gnosis see to it that an entirely new mythology is created around its associated symbols. All the imagery that surrounds the various heroes has to do with the sun passing through these 12 houses. And the modern historians know this, but dare not go into it, as this information is sequestered by many of the secret fraternities of the world. One can review all the myths of the world in relation to this astronomical movement. And all the historical ages can be analyzed in regards the signs of the zodiac. And even in our own age, we find innumerable zodiacal symbols incorporated into heraldry, paintings, architecture, city-plans and in the milieu of religion, government and media. On a conscious level man operates with the use of the long and short term memory. But our racial memory goes very much deeper than these. The legacies of the ancestors, of millennia, are encoded in the human DNA. When sacred symbols, out of the ancient theologies, are used subversively, attached to mundane products, they serve to lower and confuse the libido and the consciousness. And it is a desecration to use them in such a nefarious manner. For though no symbol is in itself negative, they can be bent to serve malign forces. They are indeed the most powerful of weapons in any arsenal. We all know of the power of symbols. Many will die and have died for them. And one will also unconsciously be manipulated by symbols all their life long. As Fredrick Nietzsche wrote: As long as one is committed to the idea that the stars are something above the head, they will lack the eye of knowledge. Lets review some more Biblical motifs in regards this ancient and mystical doctrine. But we have time and space only to look at the Divination Arts and the latest myth, Christianity. And if this is done correctly it will illuminate many other areas also. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (42 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The Age of Pisces The Christian Mythos coincided with the Age of Pisces. This is the reason why there is much in the way of water symbolism in the New Testament. There is the mention of Baptism, the fact that the disciples were mostly fishermen. Then there is the walking on the water, the washing the feet of the disciples, the feeding of the five thousand with two fish, etc,. The Christians still use the symbol of the fish to symbolize Jesus. The letters of the word Jesus Christ the Savior of the World , in Latin, give the word for fish. The Pope wears the \"Ring of the Fisherman,\" and the Pope's headdress is a fish head, from the side. The early Christians were called the \"Little Fishes.\" In the Old Testament we read about the prophet Jonah being swallowed by the whale or the great fish. All the imagery of the chapters and verses of the New Testament can be related to the Precessional phenomena, as that it what it was composed for in the first place. It was never meant to be a biography. The 33 years of Christ's ministry This is a number that connects directly with the zodiac and the movement of the sun around it. As mentioned above, the sun takes 2,160 years to pass backward through one sign of 30 degrees. Now this number 2160 or its shorter version 216, is a number that turns up in megalithic construction throughout the world. It was encoded into most of the cyclopean structures, to represent the Serpent or Sidereal Cults who were the Magi, or astrologers. Now it takes 2,160 years for the sun to clear a house. In degrees this is 30. But the sun enters at the 30th degree but is not totally clear until the 33rd degree, as it is of a certain size also. This is why they said in the Bible that the ministry of Christ begins at 30 and finishes at 33. This reference would have been unmistakable to anyone aware of the secrets of astrology. The number is connected to the initiation of the \"Sun\" of god not \"Son,\" passing through the zodiac. This is why the Freemasonic lodges also utilize the number. There are also 33 vertebrae in the spinal column. The 12 official and 72 unofficial disciples This refers to the twelve houses or signs of the zodiac that are found on or very near to the ecliptic. The ecliptic is the path of the sun around the zodiac. There are more than twelve constellations there of course. And in fact if one counts all the constellations of great importance, there are 72, not counting the 12. These extra- http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (43 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com zodiacal constellations are called the paranatellons. The also pay homage to the passing sun. So it was written that Jesus had 12 official servants and 72 others that also carried the message. The symbol of the Arthurian Round Table is also a motif that is based on the round of the zodiac. Now these paranatellons are the leitmotif behind innumerable other Biblical and mythical stories. But because we are not conversant with these constellations and their esoteric relevance we do not notice when they turn up either in fiction or art, architecture or commercial. Jonah and Daniel Two stories that make reference to these heavenly paranatellons are that of Jonah and the Whale and that of Daniel in the Lion's den. In the latter the sign of Leo is being cryptically inferred, for just like Samson and Hercules, or any solar hero, there are trials that test merit and valor. Fighting the lion or being in a den of lion is a reference to the hero conquering his own vanity or egotism. In Celtic legends, many of the heroes face a dangerous boar or dragon. The boar relates to Taurus and the dragon to the constellation called Draco, one of the most arcane of the sabean symbols. Now the great whale relates to the constellation of Cetus, in the sign of Pisces. That people still imagine Jonah being swallowed by a physical whale, to re-emerge again, is testimony to the ignorance that exists in the world. The devices that are found on heraldry and on shields all relate to the paranatellons. The sun moves to its highest point in the constellation of Cancer. It also burns brightest and hottest in the next sign of Leo. It is to commemorate these two signs that one finds a lion and a unicorn on royal insignias. They represent the royal houses of the sun. The unicorn is one of the original symbols of Cancer, the earliest being the scarab beetle, Khepera. This is the reason why according to tradition, the fair or white queen sits on the left throne, while the red king sits on the right throne. We find the same sabean motifs in chess and several other \"games.\" In chess the black and white board represents the turning of day and night. Another one of the important paranatellons of antiquity is Aquila the Eagle. This is in the sign of Scorpio. The Egyptians, Romans and Americans make much use of the Eagle because it is known to represent the sign of power and wealth. It is curious that all the major myths and folktales speak of the http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (44 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com combat between the hero and some fantastic beast. This is a staple, yet so many people take it literally. It makes reference only to the sun and the luminaries passing through the trials of the \"underworld\" or the night sky, the zodiac and the fantastic stories can only be fully understood in this context. It is also for this reason that we have the \"nursery\" rhyme of \"Jack and Jill.\" All of the nursery rhymes go back to the stellar cults. \"Jack\" represents the sun and \"Jill\" the moon. The \"hill\" which they ascend is the northern zodiacal arch, known as the \"Primordial Hill\" in ancient times. The \"pale of water,\" that they are to fetch, is a reference to the stars of Aquarius that were seen in the dawn of Leo. In this sign of Leo, when the star Sirius would be seen rising, the Nile would begin to rise to inundation. So the Egyptians said that the waters of the great goddess Isis (Sirius), were overflowing to bring them and the land new life for the year. The image that was usual for this, was that of the goddess of life, pouring forth her waters from an urn or pitcher. The images of the female, the urns and the great star, are still found on card 17 of the Tarot, called The Star , which appropriately goes with the sign Aquarius . Later, the image was masculanized to be a man with a water pitcher , still used today for Aquarius . In fact, this connection between the signs of Leo and Aquarius is the reason that today all over the world one sees beautiful fountains with lions in the architecture, or one sees lions with water pouring from their mouths. The Masonic architects of the great capitol cities new all about the relationship of the earth to the heavens as well as the dynamics of the constellations in relation to one another. And they knew that it was in the sign of the Lion (Leo), in the days of old, that the waters of the Nile would rise and flow. Then in the rhyme, Jack comes \"tumbling down.\" This has to do with the fact that after reaching the most northerly point in the zodiac and after burning so brightly, the sun cannot ascend any higher and so must begin descending. And what the sun does, so the moon must also do, or was seen to be doing. So Jill came http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (45 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com \"tumbling after.\" And it was said of the sun at this time of descent, that his \"crown\" was broken. He was old and impotent. This is depicted in the Tarot, by the Hermit , symbolizing the old sun whose light is, after the summer solstice, weak and cold. The Tarot has preserved all that was lost to astrology when the latter was doctored by those of the Judeo-Christian persuasion. All the cards contain powerful information about the constellations acquired over millennia by our ancestors. Forty days in the Wilderness In many of the Bible stories, we hear of the prophets or the heroes venturing into, or being exiled into, the \"desert\" or the so-called \"wilderness.\" The most famous cases are Abraham, Jacob, Moses and Christ, though all the major myths feature something similar. Like all the passages of the scriptures, this is an occult reference. It deals with the heavens and with astrology, and well the clergy know it. It was mentioned that the sun passing through the twelve signs of the zodiac was frequently used as a motif in the great myths of the heroes. Well the sun reaches it's highest place in the sign of Cancer. Cancer was one of the most important of the signs and the symbolism connected with it is very ancient. The Egyptians had several gods associated with the sign. The most important of these was Khepra or Khepera and his personal symbol was the scarab beetle. Later the astronomers changed the icon of the scarabeus beetle to a crab. But though the sign of Cancer was the highest position of the sign and though it is the most northerly of the sign, it was given rulership by the Moon. It was also known as the Gate of Coming Forth, meaning coming forth into the world. The souls were thought to descend to the terrestrial abode via the sign of Cancer. This is why the sign is still associated with the female and the mother. Many important constellations, including the Great Bear, Ursa Major and the pole star are also in Cancer. However the majority of the sign of Cancer is dark. Its constellations are particularly dim. And it was because of this that the ancient Magi referred to Cancer as the \"wilderness.\" And when the sun was entering into the sign it was said that it had entered into the wilderness for 40 days. This is because most signs are considered 30 degrees wide and of 30 days in duration. But with 5 or so degrees on either side, we make 40 altogether. Now when the sun physically, or any hero mythically, passes into and through the sign of Cancer, the orb or http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (46 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com hero was said to be in the \"wilderness.\" He was also said to be tempted by the evil one, the tempter, the adversary. This was in reference to the stars of Capricorn which is the domicile of the planet Saturn. Saturn was the rival (opposite) of the light. And these stars were seen on the house of Cancer during the night. So we read of Christ in the wilderness being tempted by Satan. The Egyptian period of the Inundation, was noticed to last approximately forty days, hence the connection of the number with water and initiation. It was also noticed that the days of pregnancy were approximately 40 weeks. So it was that the number became connected with periodicity, retreat, denial, sacrifice, pain and rebirth. We have the 40 days of the Deluge, 40 years of wandering in the wilderness for the so-called \"Chosen People\", 40 days of fasting by Moses, 40 days spent by Christ in the desert being tempted, 40 days between the rising of Jesus and his final departure, 40 days of mourning for Jacob, 40 days of fasting for Elijah, 40 days mourning in the rites of Persephone, the 40 days of the Christian Lenten, etc, etc,. (See Symbols, Sex and the Stars by Ernest Busenbark) The Nativity The sign of Cancer also plays a very important role in the event known as the \"Nativity,\" the birth of Christ in the manger in the inn. The improbable story of the Annunciation, the flight into Egypt and then the pause along the way are all cover stories for the relationship and dynamics of the constellations. It is reported that the son of god was born on the 25th of December. This is a few days after the famous Winter Solstice and this date had long been a pagan festival. For instance, in Egypt December 25th was the birthday of Horus, son of Isis and Osiris. But this day and the period were held sacred due to Astro-Theological reasons. It was noticed in very ancient times that during the solstice period, the sun which was traveling south into the cold of winter, would descend until it reached a point where it would stop. In fact this is what the word \"Solstice\" means, \"sun standing still.\" This most southerly position of the sun is marked on all globes, as the tropic of Capricorn, for it is in that sign that this event takes place. The ancients considered that the sun had actually died. In fact, the great orb, would remain standing still for three days neither moving north or south. Then, it was noticed, that on the third day, the sun would begin moving northward again. So it was always said that the sun, the light of the world, would die for three days and then on the third day rise again. This was known thousands http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (47 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com of years before Christianity came on the scene. Now this all occurs in the sign of Capricorn. But due to the movement of the earth in relation to the zodiac, the stars of the opposite signs or constellations are visible in the opposite houses. So in the house of Capricorn on sees the stars of the northern signs, including that of Cancer. And there are several important constellations in the sign of Cancer. One of these constellations, known to the ancients astrologers was called the Manger or the Cradle . This is the constellation, amongst others, that is seen just before dawn on the day when the sun is beginning its rebirth. So it was said that the sun of god, the light of the world, that dies on the cross, rises after three days and is born from a manger or cradle. The idea of the cross comes about because it was known that the two solstices and two equinoxes can be geometrically aligned using a perfect cross. In fact this was the origin of the symbol of the cross. It comes from no other place and no other discipline than astrology. Now we know what constellations are seen in the night sky of December. But we have not considered the eastern, western or northern sky at the same period. Visitation of the \"Magi\" and the \"Wise Men\" We read that the infant Jesus is visited at the inn by three \"wise men,\" or \"Magi\" from out of the east. On the western horizon of the heavens on the dawn of the third day after the solstice, after the 21st, that is the morning of the 25th, the sign of Taurus was seen. And this is also a sign with very prominent and important constellations. One of these is known as Orion. This refers to the warrior Orion. And in this constellation of the warrior, there is the \"belt\" of Orion. This belt is made up of three very famous and bright stars. And the Magi referred to these three stars as the \"three wise men.\" And it was also said that these wise men followed the great or \"bright star,\" in the heavens. The great star is a simple reference to the sun itself. If one believes that there were literally three wise men who followed a physical star, one can ask what these travelers would have been doing during the daytime, since the stars only come out at night. The signs, and even the planets were like the cards of the Major Arcana, originally feminized. Later many were recast as masculine. This is the case with Aquarius, Sagittarius and Taurus, etc,. Also the three wise men, that is, Orion's Belt, were originally known as the three sisters. They turn up in tales and myths like Beauty and the Beast, Macbeth and Cinderella , as well as more recent trashy examples, of sitcoms and movies, etc,. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (48 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com \"Born of a Virgin\" This makes reference to another sidereal phenomena happening at the same time. On the eastern horizon on the morning of the 25th of December, the ancients noticed the sign of Virgo. This was always known as being associated with Isis, the divine and archetypal Mother. So it was said that the sun of god, the light of the world was born or risen again after 3 days, and that he is born in a manger, of a Virgin. And even long before these particular constellational dynamics were known, the sun was said to be born of a virgin. The relevance came from the fact that in ancient times, the Egyptian New Year began in the sign of Virgo, on the 25th of July. So it was said that the sun was \"born of a virgin,\" or in a virgin. And we read that Mary came into the Inn upon a donkey or ass. This refers again to Cancer, as one of the largest and most well known of the constellations in Cancer was and is called the Ass . This constellation and that of the Manger can be seen on any planispheres. In the art-work of the Medieval and Renaissance periods, four animals are commonly seen around the cot of Jesus. There is the donkey, the bull, the lamb and the lion. These represent the constellations and paranatellons of the Cardinal signs. There can be no other reason why a lion would be incorporated into the depiction. Actually, the reference to Mary being a virgin is not from the Bible being the essence of physical accuracy. The word almah, was mistranslated to read \"virgin\" when it really meant \"unmarried mother.\" The mistranslation occurred purposely to align the concoction of the \"biography\" of Jesus to ancient cosmological and mythic motifs. The Christian should realize that if the Gospels were indeed a real biography, they would be infinitely more consistent than they are. And also if Christ existed, he did not write himself, begging the question as to whether his was the action of someone desirous of being remembered, or of someone intent on founding a new religion. He also directly prohibited any public prayer or ceremony. Were these words heeded by the founding fathers, who pretended to be so conscientious in their veracity? Herod and the \"Massacre of the innocents\" This event relates to the constellations that are found in the northern sky on the morning of December 25th. For if the stars of Cancer are occupying the house of Capricorn, so in reverse, the stars of Capricorn must be occupying the house of Cancer. Now the sign and stars of Capricorn have for millennia been associated http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (49 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com with threat, time, karma and darkness. They are often connected with the adversarial forces. And in astrological parlance an \"opposition,\" is considered an unfavorable aspect. So opposing the sign of Cancer, opposing the place of birth or rebirth of the sun, we have these stars. In the story we also have the Saturnian force opposing the coming of the \"son.\" This is Herod, the authority figure, the potentate of the times. Capricorn and Saturn, its planetary ruler, is connected with punitive authorities, as any common astrologer knows. And this is the reason why in the Nativity tale we have such a reference. The entire Nativity and all of the New Testament concerns the stars and their relationships. \"Many Mansions\" This passage \"In my father's house are many mansions\" is not a correct translation. It is meant to say, that in the father's house or abode are many rooms. It refers to the heavens, the actual abode of god, in which there are many houses. And specifically there are the twelve houses of the zodiac. There are several passages in the New and Old Testament that make direct reference to the stars and to astrology. Joseph a \"Carpenter\" This is a reference to the Masonic guilds. All Masons know the real meaning of the word. It refers to the \"Craft.\" Joseph, Julio, Julius, etc., derive from the word \"Yule,\" which comes is better understood as \"Wheel.\" The Yule referred, as it still does today, with the winter solstice. The zodiac was always likened to a rotating wheel, that began moving at the time of the winter solstice. And the solstice is in the sign of Capricorn, house of Saturn, the Artifex or crafter of the material realms. Saturn is the Carpenter. Capricorn is the place of the birth of the physical sun. So we read that the \"Son\" is born of a \"Carpenter.\" In Medieval and Renaissance art Joseph is often seen holding the symbols that have long been associated with the planet and archetype of Saturn. Peter on the inverted Crucifix Peter is a derivation of Ptah , the primordial god of ancient Egypt, the great Artificer of the material realm. In astrological terms Ptah, the great father is Capricorn and Saturn. The \"Keys of Peter\" are the keys to the cardinal sign of Capricorn where the year \"opens.\" The winter Solstice was seen as the inverted cross of the zodiac because the sun \"dies,\" in the cold of the southern climes.

Thomas is Tammuz or Tem. These gods gave the word Time . \"Time\" is the \"doubter\" that cannot understand eternity. Through the vale of time one always needs rational proof of things. Peter is also the \"denier\" of Christ. This emphasizes his role as Saturn the adversarial polarity. The cock \"crowing\" in the story of Peter's denial is another reference to Capricorn and the opening of the year. The cock is a symbol for the deity Abraxas , whose name in numerology adds to 365, the number of days in the solar year. And the denial three times, is a reference to the three days that the sun sits upon the solstice, in Capricorn, without moving. So it was said that the sun/son and his light, or his word, was \"denied\" by one of the twelve (signs). Peter was also called the \"rock.\" This is a oblique reference to Capricorn being the \"rock of the zodiac,\" the Cardinal Earth sign, that sits at the base of the circle of twelve holding it in place, as it were. \"Raising the Temple\" This is a reference to the coming forth of the sun again after 3 days. The zodiac was known by the Siderealists as the temple. Temple means Time of El or god, meaning the clock of god, which the zodiac is. Now, the rebuilding of the temple can either be seen as the actual 3 days of the sun's rebirth in the sign of Capricorn, or also as the 3 signs that precede the Spring Equinoctial rising of the sun, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. \"Days,\" refers to signs of the zodiac, they are days of Precession. Creation in \"Six Days\" This refers to a period of 2,160 x 6 or 12,960 (a number found encoded in almost all the sacred megalithic structures and temple complexes of the world). A Precessional \"day\" is 2,160 years long. This is 1 degree every 72 years for a sign of 30 degrees. But the 2,160 was considered so sacred that its mystery was rarely mentioned to the uninitiated. Instead of it, the number 666 was used. (6x6x6 = 216.) This is the real reason why the orthodox Christian hierarchy have made this number out to be satanic. It is because it has to do with Astro-Theology, astrology and the Stellar Cult. When a particular secret number was to be expressed, another related code number was used in its place. The Jews did the same thing with the word Adonai , which they uttered in place of Jehovah . There is nothing \"satanic\" about the number 666. It is, however, the \"Number of the Beast\" alright. http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (51 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com ...LET HIM WHO HATH UNDERSTANDING RECKON THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST FOR IT IS A HUMAN NUMBER...

And for his personal life, for the life of the earth upon which he lives, for light and energy he needs the outer sun, the center of the zodiac. Nine months is 270 days. The wheel of the zodiac like all circles and cycles that man will live in, is defined by 360. And the sacred numeral of the sun is 36. 270 + 360 + 36 = 666 (the Human Number) Moreover, all the numbers between 1 and 36, again make 666. The number 666 is a solar number also.

Stay tuned to this site for a full treatise by Michael Tsarion on sacred Hermetic Numerology) The Seventh or Sabbath Day The number 7 is sacred for many reasons. But in the present context, the \"day\" that the Lord \"rested\" from his labors, refers to the sign of Libra, which ends the first cycle of signs, those of the northern sky. The physical sun enters the Nekyia or Underworld in this sign. It is the place of \"rest\" because the \"job\" of the sun, meaning its creative power, is no longer as strong or as needed. The sign of Libra directly faces that of Aries, so it was said that the sun had come to the place, or the seat of harmony, where there was temporary stasis. The calm energy of Libra was the polar opposite of the aggressive and extrovert Aries. This is partly the reason why the symbol of the sign of Libra was the great http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (52 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com Scales of balance. The Autumnal Equinox is also in the sign of Libra. The symbolism around this sign is very extensive and cannot be gone into here. The sign of Libra was associated with the goddess Maat and the disciple Matthew. The word Maat gives us the word mute, meaning silence, because as we are saying, the sign of Libra was the \"resting\" place of the sun after its creative work through the seasons of spring and summer. The two Mary's There are always the two mothers around the hero in myth. And in the Christ Myth we have the mention of two Marys. There is Mary the mother of Jesus and later appears Mary the Magdalene. There is also Miriam and Martha. It is in their house that the marriage feat of Cana takes place. In many Medieval and Renaissance paintings we see the two Marys at the foot of the cross. And in the famous paintings of Leonardo Da Vinci, like the Madonna on the Rocks , we again see two female personages, two mothers. This image has clear roots in the Egyptian cosmology and mythology. Isis and Nephthys were the two mothers, consorts and goddesses. (Psychologically, they can be seen as the Soul and the Conscience. They are said by various scholars to represent the waxing and waning moon, Venus and Moon, earth and sky, day and night, and life and death, etc,.). They are seen on either side of the Solar Child Horus, in the Tarot card numbered 6 (the Lover ) . They are also seen behind the throne of the Pharaoh , in the Papyrus of Ani, in the Book of the Dead. In fact, the implication of this image is that the Pharaoh officiates for and holds his office under the auspices of the female principle. It was this that the Christian concoction was mimicking. In fact, the word \"Magdalene,\" comes from \"Magdala\" meaning \"tower.\" Mary Magdalene was called the \"Lady of the Tower.\" And this is the same name that was given to Lady Nephthys, sister of Isis, whose head-dress was a tower. And the connections between Mother Mary and Isis herself are so voluminous as to fill entire volumes. (The interested reader is directed to the works of R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz and Gerald Massey). The \"Raising of Lazarus\" Now, Miriam and Martha had a brother, called Lazarus. Lazarus is http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (53 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com \"dead\" in the tomb in the garden of Miriam and Martha. Later we see two Marys around the cross of Christ. Earlier we see two mothers around the child Jesus. Lazarus is raised from the dead. But this again goes back to Egypt. It relates to one of the best known and most powerful myths, the raising of Osiris, the god of the dead. Now the word \"Lazarus\" is a thinly disguised L- ASURAS. Asur, is the real name of Osiris in Egyptian. \"L\" just means \"the,\" as in the modern French. In Hindi the sun is called Asurya or Surya or Sri. This is where we get our Sire or Sir, when referring to a man of status and education. The Bread and Fishes As mentioned above, this has to do with the Age of Pisces. But more specifically, it has to do with the relation of the signs Pisces and Virgo which face one another in the wheel of the zodiac. In Virgo, the Egyptians began their Harvest. It is the sign of the fertility goddess Isis who later became Arista, Demeter, Ceres and Mary, etc,. The fish is the symbol of the child born of the mother and virgin (Virgo). So the entire story of the 5 loaves and the two fishes is or was a discourse on the dynamics of the constellations, particularly those of Pisces (the two fishes) and Virgo (the five loaves). Virgo is the fifth sign of the zodiac from Aries the first sign, and was always symbolized by five loaves of bread, in the same manner as hot-cross buns symbolize Easter today. But the deeper concern of the Magi with these two signs lies in the fact that they were the Descendant and Ascendant in relation to the chart of the Earth itself. And though western astrology puts all the emphasis on the latter it is really the former that has the greatest occult meaning for the times. All governmental operations are done according to the position of the descendant and that is why few believe this. The descendant is of supreme importance and there is a good reason why it is ignored by most conventional \"astrologers.\" In Gaelic legend the Salmon of Knowledge, has to do with the star Fomahault, in Aquarius/Pisces. In Christianity, many Druidic motifs are found, one being the symbol of the fish as the bestower of secret wisdom. Bread was always connected to the goddess. The four ingredients of bread represented her: grain, yeast, water and salt. Mary Magdalene at the Tomb Like Mary the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene represents the sign of Virgo. But the stars of Virgo were seen physically in the sign of Pisces. The heavenly Virgin was at the seen in the sky in http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (54 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com the morning of the Passover, of Easter, at the first days of Spring, at the Vernal Equinox. The \"tomb\" relates to the winter seasons, the signs of the underworld were the sun is concealed and considered dead or asleep. At the time of the Equinox, in the last days of the sign of Pisces, the sun is young and new, he had \"risen.\" And the stone rolling away from the door to the tomb actually relates to the earth itself, moving away from the \"door\" or the Equinox, allowing the \"bright angel\" or the light of the sun to show. The angel guarding the door is the sun which has risen. And the stars of Virgo are seen at the moment of the opening of the \"tomb.\" So it was written that \"Mary\" was present at the tomb before all else. The Passover Called such because the sun is literally passing over from the dark cold months of winter into the spring, from the state of impotency to virility and effulgence. The smearing of ram's or lamb's blood on the lintels of the doors, was due to this Passover being in the very sign of the Ram, that is Aries. Doorways and portals were always related to the signs of the zodiac, as a study of architecture will soon confirm. The Jews still blow the Ram's horn at the opening of Nissan, the first month of their year. The word April means \"I open.\" And in France on April Fools Day, a fish representing Pisces, is pinned on people. The \"Good Shepherd\" The Bible mentions Christ as the good \"Shepherd\" and there are the \"Shepherds\" who watch their \"flocks\" by night who come to visit him in the manger. First of all, there are no shepherds who watch flocks in the dead of winter, and secondly, like all the passages of the Bible, the meaning of this is to be found in the Gnostic cosmology of ancient Egypt. As the Precessional Ages change, so does the mythology that is associated with the zodiac cycles. In fact, one of the most important jobs of the Pharaonic priests, the Celtic bards, the shamans, etc., was to render the changes to the body of world myth, tailoring it to fit with the new age, while keeping the mystical coherence. In fact, the role of the \"artist,\" is the same. Now Christianity was a theology that expressed the archetypes connected with the twelfth sign of the zodiac, that of Pisces, the sign of the fishes. But the previous Age was that of Aries, the Ram. And Egyptian Pharaohs and priests of knowledge in that Age were referred to as the \"Good Shepherds.\" The \"Flocks\" that they watched by night were the stars in the night http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (55 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com sky, as they were all Siderealists. This is why we read that the Magi, as well as the \"Shepherds,\" following the bright star, knew of the place of birth of the Solar King, Jesus Christ. The word \"Shepherd\" was a euphemism for \"astrologer,\" for it is they who \"follow,\" the stars. \"Get thee behind, Satan\" Christ said these words to Peter. But the origin of these words is astrology again. Christ represents the sun, the supreme light in the heavens. But in the sidereal mythos, the planet Mars was always seen as the rival to the light of the sun, the usurper, the adversary of the light and majesty of the sun. The reason for this was that like Venus the planet Mars was often seen rising heliacally, that is with, or even slightly before the sun, on the eastern horizon. So it was said that he planet Mars does not know his place and attempts to compete with or take away from its light and power. So the solar heroes were made to retort, get thee behind , or get thee below me me Satan. Satan was Mars. One of the words we use to describe something corrupted or destroyed, is marred. And the word Satan was used generically for rival, even in the political arena. It meant combatant or rival, not necessarily evil. But one fact that has been carefully concealed is the connection between the Semitic Jehovah and Satan. In fact they were the same. Anyone who \"knee-jerks,\" at this, has not, as Jordan Maxwell says \"done their homework.\" A reading of the first books of the Old Testament, especially of Exodus and Deuteronomy, the details of bloodlust and mass-murder that are done in god's name, should allay the doubt of any rational reader as to the identity of Jehovah. In over 25,000 years the Egyptians managed to go without one act of conquest, or the expansion of their borders into any other country. They had no Empire, and strictly only defended themselves from invasion. In the short time between the coming of the Israelites to Canaan, we find nothing but devastation and genocide. So who then, are the \"Holy People?\" It is very plainly put in arcane literature that Jehovah was originally a Lord of Mars. He is also the god of battles...Mars and its lord are somehow deeply associated with strife and violence, affecting and afflicting that type of humanity inhabiting the Earth - Brinsley Le Poer Trench ( Sky People ) http://www.taroscopes.com/astro-theology/astrotheology2.html (56 of 67)22/11/2004 13:21:23"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Astrotheology and Sidereal Mythology by Michael Tsarion - www.taroscopes.com The Book of Revelation Church records stated that an Egyptian presbyter ‘wrote over’ the original Sybil’s document to create the fabricated version now in the New Testament.

There are four Sanskrit Vedas (holy books of the ancient Aryans/Brahmins) as there are 4 Gospels. Saint James - has a correlation with Yamas, the Vedic god of death. This would, therefore, link him with the astrological sign of Scorpio and perhaps even Capricorn. James is also close to Janus from which we get January. Janus comes from the Vedic god Ganesh. Saint Thomas - from Tammuz, and from the root of the word time. Thomas the \"doubter\" is time, which doubts eternity, and cannot comprehend the ordinances of the spirit. He is the twin of Christ, and therefore represents the Ka, but also Set, the brother of Horus.
