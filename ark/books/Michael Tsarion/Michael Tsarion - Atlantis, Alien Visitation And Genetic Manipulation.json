I do not know what the others are here for. (W. H. Auden) During the next 10 years, the human race is destined to finally discover the facts about its true origins and destiny. As part of this discovery, we have to address the over- whelmingly important question of how the phenomena of evil came into the world and into the consciousness of Earth’s human inhabitants. This is a question that should be on the mind of every living man and woman. It has been with us for millennia and it will be with the children of the future if we do not come upon the answer now. We have left the question of evil in the hands of theologians and scientists for too long. This was surely a mistake for, as the casualty statistics clearly testify, the institutions of religion and science have been the worst purveyors of evil that this planet has ever had to endure. After centuries of prevarication and criminality, we can no longer afford to look to these edifices to answer the all-important conundrum of evil. But if we turn from religion and science in this regard, does it mean that we are left in a void? Is there, perhaps, another answer to how the phenomenon of evil came into being? I believe that the answer lies in the ancient records of our forefathers and in the myths and legends of the pre- and post-diluvian epochs that speak of the visitation of the “gods” or “angels.” Several key researchers have stated that these beings were actually extraterrestrial entities. I address who they were, why they came here, and show that after their arrival they established their main headquarters at what we now call Atlantis, and from there, they instigated a hybridization program lasting centuries. Their genetic interference of the Earth races resulted in several hybrid creatures, one of whom I will refer to as “Homo Atlantis.” Each and every living “Adamic” human of the last 10 millennia or more is descended from this exceptional being. Every one of us has both “human” and “alien” DNA. This is exactly what we have been told in all the world’s sundry myths, from the Celtic and Arthurian legends to the Ramayana and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Preface vi Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Mahabharata . It is also implied by recent scientific findings in the geological record and the biology and genetics of humans, findings which are being sequestered by those with a vested interest in maintaining the present status quo. Its greatest proof, one can argue, lies in the mysteriously destructive behavior that we modern humans have adopted toward our own home planet, the animal kingdom, and the indigenous peoples who have lived in relative harmony with the planet. In my work I intend to show that the descendants of these ancient visitors are still in custodianship of the planet Earth. I will demonstrate that their agendas are not com- mensurate with the present or future best interests of “Adamic” mankind. Due to the surge in technological advancement, our once beauteous planet is now on the brink of ecocide, while its political and economic underclasses are subject to a very real New World Order. It has been said that there is no excuse for ignorance of the law. How- ever, it is also a truism that ignorance of the lawmakers is no excuse. The end-game of the visiting alien race and their descendants is being played out in the present “Silicon Age.” It swiftly and relentlessly advances while most of us, preoccupied with our domestic and professional roles, have little time or energy to speculate how the multi- farious phenomena of our world came into being. Adroit manipulation from those within the echelons of power make quite certain that our attention is rarely focused on the lawmakers and those in control of the economy, military, media, and technology of the world. In this book my intention is to draw the attention of the ordinary person to the reasons why he lives in the disempowered existential state he does and that while confined to circumscribed, socially-vetted roles, he and his fellows will have little ability and less resource to prevent the evil that is evidence everywhere, especially in the so-called “corridors of power.” I explain why it is that in the back of every mind is the memory of a time when life was harmonious and reverent, when there was no war and little in the way of want, subjugation, or class division. I explain something of the fate of women and why it is that they have suffered the incredible atrocities they have through the post-diluvian ages. I show that they continue to be collectively punished for a cer- tain “crime” they committed on this planet approximately 13,000 years ago. I make mention of the significant role that women are to play in the times ahead once they take back the power that was theirs in the days of old."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation vii Preface In the Epilogue, I continue to detail the end-game which is being played out as you read. The ancient Mayan Calendar stipulated the date 2012 as the end of time. It may indeed be the end of the world as we know it. The way things are going, there seems good reason for regarding ourselves on this planet to be well passed the “Eleventh Hour.” In fact, we are veritably at a “Defcon One” situation and subconsciously every- one knows it. This book, which first appeared as a short essay, was not written in, or for, levity and is not a work of fiction. It is based on three decades of research and was composed in the utmost seriousness. It demands a certain austere attention where personal prejudices and partisan conditionings are temporarily, if not permanently, bracketed. I urgently implore even the most inveterate skeptic to suspend incredulity and contemplate the sublime consequences to himself, his fellows, and to the earth upon which he lives, if the question of evil could once and for all be answered and its worst effects quickly assuaged without further loss of life or welfare. However, being well aware of the state of decay in this age of entertainment and chronic narcissism, I leave to those who can- not suspend their mental and behavioral conditioning the following quote, while dedi- cating this book to those who now understand or in the near future will come to understand that before law, country, money, pleasure, love or even god, our supernal right and need has always been and remains– Freedom !

Atlantis was not a center of advanced human civiliza- tion, but was, rather, the cre- ation of and home to alien beings that colonized the Earth. There are over 30,000 texts from all over the world that speak of this visitation, and these are only those texts that have remained intact throughout the millen- nia.

It was the original Elysian Fields. The Celts and Gaels called their ancestral homes by a variety of names which have passed down into the fairy folklore of later periods. In their legends we hear of Finias, Murias, Gorias and Falais, and of Tir Tairngire (the Land of Promise), of Mag Mell (the Plain of Happiness), Tir fa tonn (Land Beneath the Sea), of Tir nam beo (the Land of the Living), and of Tir nan og (the Land of the Young, or of Everlasting Youth). As H. G. Wells succinctly put it: There is magic in names and the mightiest among these words of magic is Atlantis...it is as if this vision of a lost culture touched the most hidden thoughts of our soul. Visitation of beings from outside our solar system is not as farfetched as it might seem and is a possibility greeted by many top scientists, including Albert Einstein. Carl Sagan personally estimated that this planet has been visited at least 5,000 times. In the book, Mankind, Child of the Stars , the authors quote Dr. Harrison H. Brown of the California Institute of Technology who they say: ...estimates that virtually every star in our galaxy has a planetary system, in each of which from two or four planets might have an Earth-like environment and chemistry that encour- ages our kind of life to exist. He gives the enormous figure of 100 billion stars with planets in the Milky Way galaxy alone. Professor Hermann Oberth, the father of rocket science, openly believed the planet Earth to be watched by beings from other planets. Indeed, ancient records also confirm that visitations were a relatively common occurrence. Generally, the visitors respected Earth's sovereignty and have conducted their researches without attracting attention or attempting to interfere with Earth’s indigenous tribes. Those who have the secrets of and who indulge in space travel maintain non-intervention as an inviolate edict. On the other hand, the Bible and the Book of Enoch , in particular, relate that Earth's sovereignty was violated by one contingent of ancient visitors. These beings were named the Nephilim (“those who were cast down”). There are many names that have come down to us that were used to describe the visitors. Some of these are: Anakim, Rephaim, Djinn, Giants, Titans, Fallen Angels, the Watchers, the Els, the Ari, Elders,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 3 From the End of Heaven Sons of Zadok, Sons of Seth, the Uranids, Cyclopeans, Promethians, Olympians, the Elect, Asuras, the Illies, Fomorians, the Necromancers, Rayless Ones, Bent Ones, the Dogons, Dagons, the Ana, Amaraka, Nagas, the Rakshasas, Dragon Kings, Naddred, the Brotherhood of the Snake, and the Serpent People. They were also referred to as the Djedhi (see Jedi). The Bible takes the position that the Nephilim were a malign presence and insists that their leaders committed a great “sin” by interfering with the evolution of humankind: And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, he that is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world, he was cast down to Earth and his angels were cast down with him. (Revelation) And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose. (Genesis, Chapter 6-8) There are several key hypotheses and theories that seek to account for the presence of these beings. Let us explore a few of the most provocative yet cogent ones. In the Bible and other scriptures, we read about these “Fallen Angels” and their sojourn on Earth; for in ancient days, their arrival and activities were not concealed as they are now. There were giants in the Earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bear children to them...the mighty men which were of old, men of renown.

(The Enuma Elish) We read from various sources that approximately 50,000 years ago a certain planetary body in our own solar system was mysteriously destroyed. This body has been called Tiamat, Phaeton, Lucifer, Marduk, Maldek, Rahab, and even Luna (not connected to the name later given to the moon). It was believed to have existed between Mars and Jupiter and was referred to as the “second sun” and may have been mistaken as such, because its atmosphere was resplendent with reflections of the actual sun. This is not as improbable as it sounds since Venus, the “Morning Star,” the second planet from the sun and the third brightest object in the sky, is so bright that it casts a distinct shadow on a moonless night. Around the time of this event, the solar system, and later the Earth, was colonized by extra-terrestrial beings who were either attracted to this solar system by that conflagra- tion or upon coming here caused the calamity themselves. Whether the disaster was natural or not, the result was that mankind on Earth experienced total and long lasting chaos and confusion. The surface of the planet Tiamat consisted mostly of great oceans. Upon its destruction, these vast saline waters entered into the Earth’s atmo- sphere causing the first of two massive prehistoric deluges and tribulations that man- kind would experience. It is thought that the alien invaders took full advantage of this predicament and moved in to bring about colonization. They met no resistance from the disoriented and weakened inhabitants of the Earth who believed their visitors were powerful gods. Some theorists, like the energetic Erich von Daniken, have also determined that there was a great intergalactic war between two (or possibly more) extraterrestrial forces in a neighboring galaxy or solar system. The result of this titanic war had enormous con-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Earth’s First Deluge 6 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation sequences for the Earth because, it is postulated, the losers on being pursued into our system pretended to take refuge on Tiamat. They even erected a makeshift radar-type station there to decoy their pursuers. However, the defeated ones had really taken ref- uge on planet Earth, not on Tiamat. Upon their arrival, they almost immediately went underground into existing caverns that through scans of the planet they knew existed. They also descended into other caverns that they themselves cut out of the living rock. There were at least five entire continents on Earth in primeval times called Appala- chia, Tyrhennia, Beringia, Fennoscandia, and Oceania. Our present continents are remnants of these. Beneath them were literally thousands of miles of subterranean pas- sages, caverns, and refuges. Some of these remain today and experts know that many of them were not made naturally. Many of our quaint myths and tales, like those of Dwarves, Trolls, Elves, the “Little People” and the Scandinavian “King Under the Mountain,” for example, concern these subterranean worlds. Almost all the native American Indian tribes speak of their original residence beneath the surface of the Earth. The pursuers, the victors of the war in the heavens, erroneously thinking that their ene- mies were on Tiamat utterly annihilated it. This horrific act and its subsequent conse- quences were witnessed and recorded: And behold a star fell from heaven...and the children of the Earth began to tremble and quake before them and to flee from them. And again I saw how they began to gore each other and to devour each other and the Earth began to cry aloud. (Book of Enoch) I saw in a vision how the heavens collapsed...and when it fell to Earth I saw how the Earth was swallowed up in a great abyss...and I lifted up my voice to cry aloud, and said “the Earth is destroyed.” (Book of Enoch) And in those days Noah saw the earth that it had sunk down and its destruction was nigh. And he arose from thence and went to the end of the earth and cried aloud to his grandfather Enoch, and Noah said bitterly, three times, ‘Hear me, Hear me, Hear me!’ And I (Enoch) said unto him, Tell me what it is that is falling upon the earth that it is in such evil plight and shaken...(Book of Enoch) And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as if it were a lamp...And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and many men died of the water, because they were made bitter.

(2 Peter 3:5) Celtic records also speak of the Deluge: I have been in the bark of Dylan, Son of the Wave, when the waters rose as lances, falling down from the skies, into the exposed abyss. (Book of Taliesin) The Indians of Lake Missoula, Washington, have in their myths the following account: One summer morning the people were startled by a rumbling and a shaking of the Earth...Then the sun was blotted out...Terrified people ran to the hills to get away from the pounding water...Then a rain of ashes began to fall. It fell for several weeks. The Ute Indians relate: The sun was shivered into a thousand fragments, which fell to Earth causing a general con- flagration. Then TA-WATS, fled before the destruction he had wrought, and as he fled, the burning Earth consumed his feet, legs, body, hands and arms...until at last, swollen with heat, the eyes of the god burst and tears gushed forth in a flood which spread over the Earth and extinguished the fire. The Navajos, Coyoteros, and Pueblos Indians have similar reports, in this vein: Their only food was meat...for all kinds of game were closed up with them...Then the men and animals began to come up from their caves and their coming up required several days. The Earth was at this time very small and the light as scanty as it had been down below, for there was as yet no heaven, nor sun, nor moon, nor stars.

It was no mere ice drift. It was sudden and terribly swift and violent. It permanently affected the world’s climate towards greater extremes of cold and damp, lengthened the solar year by enlarging the world’s orbit. It shaped world history by compel- ling the flight of survivors to other less inhospitable climes and led in considerable degree to the dispersion of the Aryans. It inundated the British Isles for a period to a great extent except the higher lands. It was the drowning of Atlantis. The Flood immortalizes the colli- sion of a fallen planet, later termed Satan, actually a cometary body, with our earth – Comyns Beaumont ( Riddle of Prehistoric Britain ) The debris from Tiamat’s destruction has become the asteroid belt with its own orbit. When it nears the Roche Limit of this planet, the debris occasionally re-enters the atmosphere, falling to the surface. As researchers like Charles Fort have so splendidly collated, our Earth has seen strange rains of fish and frogs, oil and stone, hail and ice descending from the skies. What has been kept back is the fact that these anomalies are really the remains of an entire planet, that of Tiamat. The waters of its great oceans became frozen in space. When they entered our atmosphere, they liquefied, depositing their often live contents on the surface of Earth to the perplexion and bemusement of witnesses. When it was written in the Book of Revelation that the “Battle of Armageddon” would be fought in the “air,” it seems to refer to either the ramifications of the destruction of a second luminary in our own solar system or to the believable intergalactic war that strayed also into our back yard. (See The Lost Zodiac, and the works of Erich Von Daniken, Immanuel Velik- ovsky, William Bramley, David Hatcher Childress, and J. J. Hurtak) As conjectured, the ensuing war of the air was obviously seen from the Earth by its then indigenous inhabitants. Moreover, the reconnaissance missions of the “fallen” gods in their strange “chariots” were also witnessed and recorded. These records remain today though many believe them to be mere fairy tales: More than 30,000 written documents from all over the world tell of advanced beings who either came to Earth or who were already living on Earth.

The appearance of the wheels and their composi- tion was like the color of shiny amber: and all four wings had one likeness: and their compo- sition was like a wheel in the middle of a wheel. (Book of Ezekiel) Let’s consider just a few of the strange references from the pages of the Bible testa- ments, and think to ourselves whether there is some other tale going on other than that which has been expounded from the pulpit. Then Eve looked up to heaven and saw a shining chariot come drawn by four gleaming angels whose glory no one born of woman could express nor look on their face and angels went before the chariot.

( Mahavira of Bhavabhuti, an 8th Century Jain text, speaking of earlier records) Now Vata’s chariot’s greatness! Breaking goes it, And Thunderous is its noise, To heaven it touches, Makes light lurid [a red fiery glare], and whirls dust upon the earth. The airplane occupied by Salva was very mysterious. It was so extraordinary that sometimes many airplanes would appear to be in the sky, and sometimes there were apparently none. Sometimes the plane was visible and sometimes not visible, and the warriors of the Yadu dynasty were puzzled about the whereabouts of the peculiar airplane. Sometimes they would see the airplane on the ground, sometimes flying in the sky, sometimes resting on the peak of a hill and sometimes floating on the water. The wonderful airplane flew in the sky like a whirling firebrand - it was not steady even for a moment. (The Mahabharata) The head of Sanskrit at the University of Madras, Dr. V. Raghavan, writes: Fifty years of researching this ancient works convinces me that there are livings beings on other planets, and that they visited earth as far back as 4,000 B.C...There is a just a mass of fascinating information about flying machines, even fantastic science fiction weapons, that can be found in translations of the Vedas, Indian epics, and other ancient Sanskrit texts. Zacharia Sitchin and others of his ken are of the opinion that the losers in this cosmic “Armageddon,” that is, the visitors, were generally moral and good, and that their arrival here was generally a good thing for the Earth.

There is a great deal of information coming out of the ancient legends that convinces this writer that the visitors, for all their intellectual acumen and technological expertise, were morally corrupt, without spiritual sensibili- ties of any kind. These alien, criminal renegades took their cover on Earth, met with the indigenous tribes, were considered gods, and took full advantage of the relative credulity of their hosts. Having no love for the people of Earth, they almost immedi- ately sought to enslave them. It is our opinion that they were successful and that no one can have a real grasp of the history and progress of humankind without taking into consideration the idea of alien colonization. Many ancient legends speak of this visita- tion. For instance, the Hindu scripture, Srimad Bhagavatam , relates the coming of a demon race which invaded the three planetary systems. One of the epithets given to the visitors was the “Ant People ” from the fact that they had the habit of mining and burrowing underground and living there in complex colonies. This was a practice that availed perfect concealment as these renegades knew that it was absolutely imperative that they were not traced to this planet and that their previous hosts believed them utterly destroyed. The Celtic legends, and even the Bible, declare that the Nephilim (fallen angels) took refuge under water in their crafts. No craft they knew, with woven brick and jointed beam to pile the sunward porch; but in the dark earth burrowed and housed like sunless ants in sunless caves. (Aeschylus) And the King said to her, be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the Earth. (I Samuel 28:13) Dead things are formed from under the water, and the inhabitants thereof...(Job 12:5) With this kind of phenomena occurring, we can perhaps make sense of one of the most enigmatic edicts from the Yahwistic commandments: You shalt not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is under the water of the earth.

In David Icke’s Children of the Matrix, we read: Thirty-six underground cities have been discovered in Cappadocia so far and some are huge complexes going down eight levels. The ventilation systems are so efficient that even eight floors down the air is still fresh. Thirty vast underground cities and tunnel complexes have also been found near Derinkuya in Turkey. The Hopi Indians speak of an underground world called Sipapuni where they say their tribe originated. Interestingly, G. Warren Shufelt discovered the underground tunnels beneath Los Angeles, which the Hopi Indians had for centuries believed were inhab- ited by a lizard race over 5,000 years before. In his book Agartha, Robert E. Dickhoff tells of a Tibetan monk who learned that an alliance of reptilians and “human” black magicians were causing chaos and destruction in the surface societies by projecting malevolent energy fields into people’s minds using that which we call witchcraft–the manipulation of energy. Dickhoff says that the monk led 400 warrior-monks into the caverns to do battle with this “serpent cult.” Scholar and researcher, J. J. Hurtak declares: In our research in Africa, the Far East and the mountains of South America, we have come across statuary of very grotesque beings, who according to the Indian and Shamanistic tra- dition, went into the Earth at the time of a great cataclysm. . . The Apache Indians tell stories of tunnels between their lands and the city of Tiahuan- aco and claim that their ancestors traveled for years by this route. The Indian chiefs also assured that the tunnels were ...carved out by rays that destroy the living rock. And that their creators were: ...beings who live near the stars.

We could fill vol- umes with the references of alien visitation in connection with the Hollow Earth."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 13 Earth’s First Deluge These accounts of the ancients have been dismissed for centuries and often ridiculed and misunderstood. For instance, the visitors are sometimes described to be fantastic in aspect, sometimes as having “two heads” or faces. But this description is compre- hensible when we realize that it refers to a face inside a space helmet, which appeared to our ancestors as two faces or heads. The “Men of Brass” or “Bronze” was also a title used for the visitors possibly due to the metallic suits they wore. They also seem to have communicated in strange voices (many-tongues). Can this not also be explained in practical terms? Can the references about the “fallen angels” in the Old Testament , Book of Enoch, and the Dead Sea Scrolls , for example, not be based on actual fact? The Nephilim had to begin calibrations of the Earth in relation to the neighboring plan- ets and stars almost immediately after ascent from their subterranean havens. Although they were in no immediate hurry, they believed they could leave the planet whenever they desired. Earth was certainly not their home, but it was better than nothing in an emergency. But because they had arrived suddenly and not by choice, they were in a predicament as to where they were in celestial terms and in a quandary about where to go in the future. The Nephilim with the help of the Neanderthal race constructed and erected stone monuments and giant Earth calendars on the plains for their astronomers to engage in calculations to orient themselves correctly in this new wing of the galaxy. There is some evidence to indicate that the Nephilim did not leave Earth immediately because they feared that the solar system after the destruction of Tiamat was magnetically unstable to the extent of preventing them from flying out and navigating easily. (One does not drive their car through a volcano or earthquake by choice). The risk was too great for a time. They also did not know if their enemies where still watching for them or whether they had set some kind of warning “alarm” system that would signal the Nephilim’s presence. The Nephilim established their main headquarters, Atlantis, on the continent of Appa- lachia. From this center they would corral and experiment on the indigenous Earth inhabitants taken from cultures and tribes that were shaken asunder by the recent celestial catastrophe. Nearly all the native cultures of the Earth record the visitation of strange and advanced individuals possessed of miraculous powers. An interesting anecdote which repeats throughout the ancient records and accounts is that the beings who visited the various countries were never numerically many. The records say that"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Earth’s First Deluge 14 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation they appeared in groups of three or four members. The fact that the visitors were of such a small number is suggestive that they were actually contingents of a larger mass centered elsewhere, that they were on reconnaissance missions, and that were data gatherers and ambassadors sent out to the corners of the globe. The strangers could knit bones, provided food, took counsel, gave magnificent gifts, spoke in strange tongues, were intensely intelligent, and pointed to distant galaxies when asked about their origins. Many texts record that some of the visitors where also extremely venge- ful when wronged. And they were after mineral wealth and human labor. (See the works of David Hatcher Childress.)"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 15 CHAPTER 3 Old World Disorder After Atlantis was constructed, the alien-visitors sought to establish the “New Order” over their minions, the erstwhile natural and nature loving inhabitants of the Earth. Their common rationale was the same as John Milton’s fictional archangelic renegade, Lucifer: Better to reign in hell, than serve in heaven. (Paradise Lost) One of the ways in which they sought to accomplish their goal involved biogenetic interference with and alteration of the indigenous Earth inhabitants. Such a practice was known to be a cardinal sin, and so, originally, normal sexual intercourse was attempted with unsatisfactory results: And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose. (Genesis 6-8) And the daughters of Cain with whom the angels had companied conceived, but they were unable to bring forth their children, and they died. And of the children who were in their wombs some died, and some came forth, having split open the bellies of their mothers they came forth by their navels. (The Ethiopian Kebra Nagast ) Extraterrestrials visit neighboring planets and galaxies, but they rarely interfere with the evolution of the species that they find there. This edict the Nephilim disregarded. And they knew that there would be a penalty for their heinous actions. In the Book of Enoch , we read of the Nephilim leader (called Samjaza, Anzal, Belial, Enlil, etc.) speaking of the deed to his 200 brethren: And then Samjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Old World Disorder 16 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Individuals were selected from various tribes and lured to Atlantis, perhaps under the pretext of being “chosen” and specially favored. As part of other nefarious stratagems, we find that large sections of certain tribes were lured and corralled in Atlantis. It may be noted that though it is now common, it is not normal for mankind to congregate and live in cities. This is entirely artificial. The design of the continent of Atlantis was created in such a way as to make possible the segregation of populations while the surveys and researches were ongoing (see Planet of the Apes ). The Earth’s natural pre-visitation caretakers may have been the Neanderthals, Cro- Magnon, or even the Engis peoples. Though these peoples have always been put before us as backward and dull-witted, the palaeo-archaeologists are finding evidence that contradicts these commonly held assumptions. Nearly all the theories that have perpetuated this conjecture are now antiquated and unsustainable. It is known, how- ever, that these Neanderthals suddenly vanished from the Earth for no known reason. Authors Max H. Flint and Otto O. Binder wrote in their book, Mankind, Child of the Stars : Cro-Magnon Man appeared with a mysteriously improved skeletal characteristics and with a cranial capacity that is amazingly in excess by 100 cubic centimeters of that of modern man...A similarly large degree of brain expansion occurred in absolutely no other species on Earth in all the ages of the past, not has any genus shown evidence of brain mutation of a comparable magnitude since antiquity. Those ever so “lucky” persons who were chosen for hybridization by the Nephilim inherited the alien DNA and became morally corrupt. Some of these persons were sent back into their tribes as kings possessed of powerful magic and wealth. Henceforth, bloodline would be extremely important to the monarchs of the Earth. Records were kept in Atlantis of all their engineered slaves, and from then onwards, the progeny of those persons would be favored and protected. Some writers contend that after hybrid- ization the genetically manipulated individuals had very extended lifetimes and could maintain the same form for many hundreds of years."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 17 Old World Disorder In prehistory, most tribes were predominately of the matriarchal type, which is why all Bronze Age villages were circular in design. Even the later concept of the Arthurian “Round Table” indicates the idea that no one man is head and that kingship (sic, kin - ship) arises from the camaraderie and collaboration of all, not the ego driven, auto- cratic travesties of later periods. In many cultures the dead warriors were buried in cir- cular cairns or mounds called sidhes (pronounced she ). This word connotes female breast and the burial chambers actually look like such from outside. The implication is that the dead are placed again inside the womb, the breast, the symbols of renewed life. The Egyptians used to place their dead within sarcophagi that were symbols of the female body. In fact, the interior of the lid of the sarcophagus had the image of the night sky as the over-arching body of the mother goddess Nuith. Clearly, the monarchies of any age have been responsible for atrocious crimes. And yet, the monarchs themselves claim rulership by “Divine Right.” James VI of Scotland became James I of England and was the main proponent of this. The origins of the sanctity of kings goes back to pre-diluvian times, however. The state of monarchy is the most supreme thing upon earth, for kings are not only God's lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon god's throne, but even by God himself are called gods...and so their power after a certain relation compared to divine power...for if you will consider the attributes to God, you shall see how they agree in the person of a king...to dis- pute what God does is blasphemy...so it is sedition in subjects to dispute what a king may do in the height of his power. I would not have you meddle with such ancient rights of mine as I have received from my predecessors... James VI (King of Scotland and England) . On Atlantis, the segregated or imprisoned groups had their biology studied and exper- iments were continued for centuries. Along with their supersensory skills, the Nephilim also possessed great knowledge of biology, crystallography, organic comput- ing, and robotics, etc. Such sciences were common in pre-diluvian epochs and are not discoveries of our “silicon age.” Many scholars have pondered why it is that certain ancient cultures like the Sumerian, Indo-Aryan and Egyptian have alphabets, mathe- matical concepts, and symbolic cosmologies, all just appearing fully formed without record of the normal antecedent and cumulatory stratifications that must attend these achievements. Here are some examples of the quandaries that beset the scholars and academes. Sir Leonard Woolley in his Ur of the Chaldees wrote: There is nothing to show to what race the first inhabitants of Mesopotamia belonged...At a date which we cannot fix, people of a new race made their way into the valley, coming whence we do not know..."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Old World Disorder 18 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation And Professor W. B. Emery wrote in his Archaic Egypt the following: At approximately 3400 years BC a great change took place in Egypt and the country passed rapidly from a state of advanced Neolithic culture...to two well organized monarchies...at the same time writing appears. Monumental architecture and the arts and crafts developed to an astonishing degree...there appears to be little or no background to these fundamental developments... In Colin Renfrew’s Before Civilization , the following passage: Archaeologists all over the world have realized that much of prehistory as written in the existing textbooks, is inadequate, some of it quite simply wrong...It has been sug- gested...that the changes now at work in prehistory herald the shift to a ‘new para- digm,’...made necessary by the collapse of the first paradigm... After hybridization, certain “chosen ones” from the Earth men were also brought into the “inner circles” of the visitors. This would have been done for purely pragmatic rea- sons. Some of those genetically modified were sent back to their societies and exalted as priests, elders, or even kings. They were lackeys of the malign warlocks of Atlantis who really ruled from “behind the thrones,” keeping in touch with their minions through the use of powerful crystal “seeing stones.” In Our Haunted Planet by John Keel, we read: According to the traditions of many isolated peoples, the first great emperors in Asia were god-kings who came down from the sky, displayed amazing superhuman abilities, and took over. There was a veritable worldwide epidemic of these god-kings between 5,000 and 1,000 BC... They were also capable of telepathic communications: Their close world-wide cooperation has been maintained by instantaneous intercommunica- tion by telepathy which is taught them. (Eklal Kueshana , The Ultimate Frontier ) It is from these times that we have the concept of initiation into the so named “mysteries,” which were always some kind of sequestered knowledge of enormous portent that only a few “special” severely tested persons could know about. Later, it was thought, after mankind defied the alien despots, some of these initiation processes were maintained for the keeping of the knowledge sacred and out of their hands."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 19 Old World Disorder These false envoys and overlords imposed taxation, enforced slavery and sacrifice, and generally lived off the labor of the hybrid Earth people. The indigenous people of Earth did not rebel immediately against these foreign oppressors. Strong assertive leaders, it seems, were needed after the destruction of Tiamat and the subsequent ter- restrial calamities. The false ones promised consolidation, order, safety, and privilege. They instigated hierarchic control, the division of labor, merit-oriented advance, and induced conditions that inevitably lead to man’s disconnection from nature. Necessity fostered the worst of tyrannies to descend on prehistoric humanity. Humankind would not just create or accept such structures as a matter of course. It takes extraordinary circumstances for the millennia old, symbiotic “umbilical” connection to the planet of origin and to the universal order to be occluded and for humankind’s chthonic sen- sibility and natural love to become sublimated and directed away from its prime source and object into purely pragmatic power-relations. It is logical to assume that these incongruent and deviant patterns have not arisen merely as a matter of course, as a consequence of the erstwhile organic evolution of our species, as modern intellectuals advocate. We feel that it is more consistent with the facts to posit some external interference. And there are many myths, legends, and sagas that conceal, behind the wide and complex panoply of euphe- misms and allegories, allusions to this very predicament. From the presence of the aliens and from their overt dominion, we have the creation of competitive sports, tests of prowess, and the exaltation of the muscular skills. There also came the pursuit of aggressive warfare and the conquest of other tribes and nations. There came the division of people into superior and inferior groups. We must ask – are such habits intrinsic to Earth humans? Are they productive? Would they not be more commensurate with the agenda of those bent on weakening the populations of the Earth, on embroiling them in futile and destructive wars, on arousing aggressive instincts, which cause so much systemic and social despair? From their presence, came the reality of ritual murder and human sacrifice to further instill fear and provide sustenance to the gods of the “Underworld” (sic, night sky). This accounts partly for why once great and benign civilizations, peaceful and respect- ful of nature, suddenly descend into debauchery and civil strife. In the legends of the Tahoe (California) Indians, for instance, we read of the strife : There was a time when their tribe possessed the whole Earth and were strong and numerous, and rich; but a day came when a people rose up stronger than they and defeated and"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Old World Disorder 20 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation enslaved them. Afterward the Great Spirit sent an immense wave across the continent from the sea, and this wave engulfed both the oppressors and the oppressed, all but a very small remnant. The records of hundreds of cultures lead us to the conclusion that their eventual decline and fall was indeed due to external interference. The alien invaders and their lackeys also instilled the idea, now so all pervasive, that nature was threatening and antithetical to humankind, something to be abused and possessed. This instinct is cer- tainly not natural to terrestrial humans but would be consistent with the outlook of those not from this planet. It is extremely unlikely that such a pernicious philosophy could originate from within humankind. For reasons that should now be apparent, historians have suppressed most of the evidence of the pre-diluvian matriarchies. All the various tenets of post-diluvian religion have their roots in the lexicons of those bent on mind control and the enslavement of human- kind. The utter perversity of their natures could not be better revealed than by the philosoph- ical perusal of these so-called religious credos. A study of Christian history discloses the portentous fact that the concept of the “malig- nancy of matter,” coming into the movement from Hinduism through Zoroastrianism, became an influence overwhelmingly dominating the theology and the ethic. It bred the mon- strous cult of asceticism, whose driving motivation was the idea that the instincts of the flesh must be crushed down in the interests of the spirit... The tragic consequence of this stagger- ing default of insight are incalculable, but in all conscience overwhelming to any intelli- gence that discerns it. It lay the Christian mind open to the obsession of a psychological influence that has been nothing less than devastating to sanity, inflicting upon the psyche a trauma that has produced morbidity and crushed to a degree the natural instinct for human happiness. (Alvin Boyd Kuhn , The Ultimate Canon of Knowledge ) From these malefactors comes the notion of the removed god, a distant, immaterial and punitive “Demiurge” that requires man to repress natural instincts and live in con- stant guilt. From them also comes the pernicious concept of a fallen god who tempts the unwary and leads one into everlasting perdition. They also instilled the fallacy that women are lower in ontological status than men and that they are to be distrusted and kept in subordinate positions. Polygamy, another practice pervasive in certain ancient societies, was again based on the need for these biologically “superior” entities to reproduce their kind as fast as was possible. Keep- ing women in submissive positions and having them uneducated mitigated against"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 21 Old World Disorder them ever wondering why they were being used as incubators. Tribes who are in true harmony with nature and who desire to remain so are instinctively repulsed by the over-population of the Earth. (See the works of Prof. L. A.Waddell). Rebellion broke out on Atlantis, possibly due to a falling out between factions of the oppressors, with one group, as a result, taking sides with the humans. Some say that a small group of alien priests took pity on the Earth and sought to restore the natural rule, or close to the original condition (see David Wood’s Genesis, A First Book of Revelation ). Others contend that it occurred due to the intervention of galactic forces that sought to eradicate the “Bent Ones” from this planet, or at least restrict their cor- rupting operations. Whatever the actual truth, it appears the rebels decided that it would be futile to go into the individual colonies throughout the Earth to depose the Atlantean demigods. Better to strike at the root of the problem, Atlantis itself. Many world myths and legends speak of wars between the giants. The stories have uncanny similarities and may refer to this attempt of Earth inhabitants to eradicate strange demonic visitors. It has been noted for instance that the Mahabharata in India, the Trojan wars and the Gaelic wars in Ireland, all occurred relatively simultaneously (see Immanuel Velik- ovsky). In the story of Beowulf , one of the first romances of the later Anglo-Saxon period, we again find the story of demonic forces that live in the wild places and prey off the people. The “Romances” have the same refrain wherever they are found. All speak of the banished hybrids, living on islands or under the Earth. Is this a mere story that is put before us? Was it all just creative license? Grendel this monster grim was called, march-river mighty, in moorland living, in fen and fastness; fief of the giants the hapless wight a while had kept since the Creator his exile doomed. On kin of Cain was the killing avenged by sovran God for slaughtered Abel. Ill fared his feud, and far was he driven, for the slaughter's sake, from sight of men. Of Cain awoke all that woful breed, Etins and elves and evil-spirits, as well as the giants that warred with God weary while: but their wage was paid them! (Beowulf - Prelude, Episode 1)"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Old World Disorder 22 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation On Atlantis, the peoples of the sequestered colonies of original Earth inhabitants, fore- warned of this coming rebellion, would have been prepared to vacate the precincts and overthrow the tyrannical technocratic elites. Knowledge, instruments, and books were rescued and preserved. The freed persons moved onto the waters in ships and with the use of certain devices attempted to relocate their respective lands. Some that were not able to do this settled on lands that were unfamiliar. This is clearly the case with the Gaels. In fact, it is recorded that they came to Ireland from four sacred islands that were destroyed because the rulers were corrupt. In Irish myth, we read of the succes- sive waves of colonists, each declaring that, although in opposition politically, they were kindred to those already in situ . The story of the migrations has survived down to modern times and been retold in masterworks of fiction and non-fiction. (See Charles Squire, Jim Fitzpatrick, Morgan Llewellyn, Ursula Le Guin, Frank Herbert, and Rob- ert Holdstock.) Many of the people who left Atlantis after the overthrow were themselves genetically altered and possessed what was called “magical powers,” which awed all that were witness to them. The extraterrestrial priests who sided with the Earth-people set them- selves up as kings or more likely as the advisors of the indigenous but “magically endowed” kings. The Arthurian legends speak of such beings, for instance, Merlin. In other Celtic myths, we have Taliesin, Amergin, Tuan, Breas, Balor, Diancecht, Indech, Elathan, Lugh, Nuada, Culhulainn, Ossian, Finn Mac Cumhail, and a host of others. In these and other stories, the advisor, leader, or king has pronounced strength, wisdom, clairvoyance, beauty, and long life, which are all the possible results of genetic modifi- cation. One may also recall the strange attributes of the Russian warlock, Grigori Rasputin, enig- matic occult advisor to the Romanov Dynasty of the 19 th Century. ( Grigori is a Greek word for fallen angel. See Alex de Jong’s Rasputin ). In many cases, he also possessed a familiar weapon or talisman with magical proper- ties. Magic was the word used for high technologies not understood by the witnesses of the day. If a machine works perfectly, the results are like magic. The Celtic sagas are full of mention of “magical” weapons and treasures. One of the latter was the sacred “Stone of Fal” that was placed under the throne of the king in Tara (Drumcain or Hill of the Serpents ). This stone, it was said, would cry out if a false one sat to be crowned. We might ask what mystery is"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 23 Old World Disorder secreted in this myth? The word Fal actually means stone and is the root of the word phallic . The “Stone of Fal” is, therefore, the “Stone of Stones,” probably a powerful crystal that would indicate if a person was genetically altered in some way. (This stone, like the lingam of the Hindus, was believed to be connected to the planet Saturn, for whom the earthly kings ruled.) In folklore, there are covert references to genetic manipulation. Consider the entity called a “Changeling.” Was this an alien substitute for a human infant? Moreover, in prehis- toric times, it was impossible for anyone to rule in Ireland if they were blemished , a rule that was assiduously honored. Could blemished be a reference to artificial alteration? The world’s folklore is replete with warnings about witches who can be identified as “evil” because of their strange markings or deformities. Though later mundane history tells of much abuse of such lore, it is reasonable to assume that they were founded on some factual- ity. This is also the reason why there is the emphasis on purity of the bloodline when it comes to kingship. This purity was essential to both sides, each having a vested interest in having only their own lineage enthroned. Innumerable rituals associated with kingship date from this. And in certain tribes there is the custom of being “bonded by blood.” In such cer- emonies, a person who has come to love and respect another, lets physical blood and literally presses this to that of his fellow who has likewise let free their blood. Is this just another meaningless heathen ritual? Does this not mean that kindredness has to do with the same blood, not dis -similar blood? And what are we to make of the Persian tale of the “Genie in the bottle.” Could these tales not also conceal facts about laboratories, evil wizards, hybrid- ization, and genetic manipulation? Not all the returning natives freed from Atlantis found it easy to gain access to their kingdoms or lands or to take control in their enslaved provinces. During the reign of the alien tyrants, the morale of the enslaved was reduced, while superstition and suspi- cion were rampant. When it was learned that usurpation had occurred on Atlantis, rul- ing despots feared for themselves and for their exposure and expulsion. Through the adroit use of manipulation and propaganda, they turned the people against the new- comers, often engaging them in battle. In this endeavor the use of betrayers was espe- cially useful. They spread false rumors that the newcomers were not returning saviors, but dangerous sorcerers who would steal the children and bring disease (all things that the tyrant masters were themselves engaged in). All over the world, we have then one of two possible outcomes. Either the free ones triumph, banishing, imprisoning, or killing the evil ones, or alternatively, the evil ones prevail to continue cruel, inhumanitarian regimes. In this latter scenario, the freed Atlanteans would be killed, betrayed, or imprisoned. They, like the less endowed natives, would live out lives of poverty and servitude. This is the situation that we find in evidence all over the globe coming down into historical times (see the saga of Robin"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Old World Disorder 24 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Hood). And since, for the most part, the evil ones remained in power, they had the offi- cial histories fabricated to aggrandize themselves and to perpetuate the status quo. Their priestly allies were especially complicit in this endeavor. Their mythographers pushed back in time the dates of the arrival of their masters by hundreds of thousand of years, making it impossible for later scholars to piece together the facts. They also saw to it that facts would be further distorted by creating around the various accounts innumerable elaborations and exaggerations, such as we now find in all myths, legends, and fairy tales. For a certain time, it seems that the efforts of the rebels were successful. The humans probably relied on their physical numbers. However, the “evil ones” who lost battles or who were deposed continued to practice their vile arts. More importantly, the off- spring of those who had been genetically altered also continued to exist and procreate. They had within them the instincts of aggression and power mania innate to their fore- fathers. It is these persons who moved from the limbic and later the left-brain modality who excelled in the technological sciences and were predisposed to feeling separate, distinct from, or superior to the planet’s natural inhabitants. They were the ones who found it easy to destroy nature and to manipulate and murder their fellow human beings. Throughout historical time, we find personages rising to the top of political and cultural life who labor so assiduously for technological advance and yet who demonstrably display little love or concern for humanity. Do such scenarios occur for the reasons that we have been conditioned to believe? Can the same set of facts be approached from another angle?"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 25 CHAPTER 4 Lemuria and Homo Atlantis As we continue to review even more coherent and provocative hypotheses and theo- ries concerning Atlantis, pre-diluvian history, and the coming of evil, we note how scriptures, especially the Bible, contain references to key events: The history of the Old Testament is the history of Atlantis. (Comyns Beaumont) Some key modern writers, such as Brinsley La Pour Trench, Barbara Marciniak, and William Bramley have espoused other important theories that seek to account for the presence of evil in the world. These accounts relate to the same idea of alien visitation and colonization. In this case, the alien invaders are referred to either as the “Serpent People” or the “Brotherhood of the Snake.” (It has been repeatedly noted that though physical snakes were unknown on most islands, the symbol of the snake or serpent on carvings, etc., is extremely conspicuous). In the Apocalyptic Fragment of Clement, we read: And on Earth shall be monsters, a generation of dragons of men, and likewise of serpents. But though this is their title, it should not be taken that they had the physical likeness of ser- pents, which they did not. A fuller explanation of this is provided later. Though no two writers wholly agree on the question of evil, or an alien presence, according to the most coherent theories the visitors are usually described as being of dubious morality but possessed of great mental and technical power. This writer is rel- atively convinced that they were headquartered on Atlantis, and that the notion that this continent was the center of all that was elevated and good is erroneous, being founded less on fact and more on wishful thinking."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Lemuria and Homo Atlantis 26 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation On Atlantis genetic experiments were begun on indigenous Earth humans with the equipment that was brought from the alien planet of origin: And God said: Let us make man in our image, after our likeness...(Genesis 1:26) The race that they subsequently created, the “Sons of the Serpents,” possessed the DNA of their alien fathers, as well as that of the indigenous Earth people, the Homo Sapiens. (In the Bible, the correct translation of “create” is “build.”) These genetically created offspring were made to serve the needs of their creators in the “Garden of Edinu or Eden.” They are “Homo Atlantis.” The original pre-visitation Earth inhabitants were probably the Cro-Magnon, Engis, Homo Erectus or Neanderthals. There could have been some other race altogether, but given the suppression of data in these subjects, it is doubtful if we will ever know the truth about our Earth ancestors. Recent findings seem to indicate that both Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon races were genetically interfered with and were the victims of hybridization. Unluckily for the “Serpent Masters,” this first-born progeny eventually began to chafe against their imposed servitude. Their human qualities and sensibilities were such that they were not only lofty of intellect, but were possessed of a moral and spiritual dimension utterly lacking in their extraterrestrial masters. As a result of this, they openly began to resist their creators whom they disliked and came to physically out- number. It is written that these “Sons of the Serpent” would not recognize the superi- ority of their masters, since they lacked the exalted qualities. Finally, after an unspecified period of time, the majority of the “Sons of the Serpents” leave the “Gar- dens of Edinu” (Atlantis) and vacate the continent of Appalachia, relocating to the island of Oceania, later known as Lemuria, where today’s Pacific Ocean is. Here they establish a thriving civilization where they also practiced the high sciences. The sub- lime cultural inventions and philosophies that enrich humankind then and now origi- nate from them. Lemuria comes from Mu or Mu-devi which means the “Land Ancestral” or “Land of the Ancestors.” Mu-Devi was the Hindu mother goddess. Shiva was her counterpart and is the “Great Father” of mankind. An Indian Tamil text, Silappadikaran , describes a lost continent in the Pacific and Indian Ocean that it calls Kumai Nadu or Kumari Kandam, which means the “Dragon Land of the Immortal Serpents.” Their rebellion and departure affronted their creators who, from that time onward, would consider their “first born” avowed adversaries."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 27 CHAPTER 5 The Race of Adam In a late Sumerian myth...it is declared that men were created to relieve the gods of the oner- ous task of tilling their fields. Men were to do that work for them and provide them with food through sacrifice. (Joseph Campbell, Occidental Mythology ) The Serpent Masters deduced that the first time round they had made a fundamental mistake. They had given their progeny the same intellectual capacities that they them- selves possessed, which meant their creations also understood all about genetic sci- ence. This time, it was decided that such invaluable knowledge would be completely withheld and that the biological and cerebral centers of higher intelligence would be blocked. This would entail genetic modification. And the euphemism that has come down to us connoting this state of ignorance concerning the high sciences is “naked.” The members of this new slave race who were termed “Adamic” (meaning “from the Earth”) would be kept “naked” in the garden. After the rebellion of their “first born,” the original “Serpent People” were forced to return to the draw- ing boards to again begin reproducing a new race, one that would this time serve them obediently. We read of this in the Popul Vuh : Let us make him who shall nourish and sustain us! What shall we do to be invoked, in order to be remembered on Earth? We have already tried with our first creations, our first creatures; but we could not make them praise or venerate us. So, then, let us try to make obedient, respectful beings who will nourish and sustain us. Satan and Eve by William Blake"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Race of Adam 28 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation The words “Adam” and “Eve,” like those of “Jehovah” and “Elohim,” do not imply individ- uals but races . When this is understood, so much more becomes clear when reading and interpreting the scriptures. The “Adamic Race,” like the original indigenous peoples of Earth, were of both gen- ders, although the modified Eves could not reproduce sexually at that time. The male Adams, consistent with their human strain, possessed a foreskin. Later, it came down in priestly rituals that this human foreskin would be surgically removed as a mark of servitude to the overlords. Circumcision is the ritualized removal of the human aspect in favor of the alien, done to create a subliminal affiliation. When it is said that Eve was made from the “rib” of Adam while he slept, the reference is again to genetics and bioengineering. Being “naked” ultimately meant that the members of the hybrid “Adamic” servant race would be strictly forbidden to partake of something now referred to as the “Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil” or the “Tree of Life.” These were other cryptic euphemisms for the knowledge of biology and genetics. The DNA was always likened to a tree with 22 branches, or later, in esoteric lore, pathways. The knowledge of genetic science was symbolized by possession of a straight staff with a serpent motif. This is the reason why even today, the medical profession uses the Hermetic Caduceus. There is nothing esoteric about the term, “Tree of Good and Evil.” When it is realized that the reference is to DNA, all becomes clear. Both sides, literally, the good and the evil had knowledge of the “Tree.” Therefore, it should read as the “Tree of the Good and/ or the Evil.” Alan Alford is just one of many scientists who is open to the concept of alien interven- tion when accounting for the anomalies surrounding the origin and evolution of man. He writes: Homo sapiens has acquired a modern anatomy, language capability, and a sophisticated brain (well beyond the needs of its everyday existence) apparently in defiance of the laws of Darwinism. There are a number of possible explanations for this anomaly. One is that man- kind evolved in the sea, and that crucial fossil evidence is thus missing. Another is that Dar- winian theory itself has a missing link. And a third explanation is that the genes for modern man were suddenly implanted by an intelligent extraterrestrial species who colonized the Earth."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 29 The Race of Adam Sir Leonard Woolley writes in Ur of the Chaldees : There is nothing to show to what race the first inhabitants of Mesopotamia belonged...At a date which we cannot fix, people of a new race made their way into the valley, coming whence we do not know... In Uriel’s Machine, authors Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas write: ...Neanderthals did not contribute mitochondrial DNA to modern humans; Neanderthals are not our ancestors... In his book The Neanderthal Enigma , James Shreeve comments on the enigma of our human development: An ‘all-important transition’ did occur, but it happened so close to the present moment that we are still reeling from it. Some here in the vestibule of history, just before we started keep- ing records on ourselves, something happened that turned a passably precocious animal into a human being. Harvard scientist John A. Ball muses on the matter: Most evolutionists believe that it (life) was generated long ago but perhaps it never was...Perhaps the Earth was infected from elsewhere... Top scientist Gunther Rosenburg writes: Man is a unique animal. He stands out like a sore thumb when comparisons are made with his cousins, the apes. The differences are more numerous than the similarities. Darwin’s Theory of Evolution is simply unproven. Catastrophist and maverick scientist/cosmologist Immanuel Velikovsky, probably one of the most abused scholars in history, wrote: Most controversial is the evolutionary question. I have done a great deal of work on Darwin and can say with some assurance that Darwin did not derive his theory from nature but rather superimposed a certain philosophical world-view on nature and then spent 20 years trying to gather the facts to make it stick."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Race of Adam 30 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation And researcher Laurence Gardner puts it this way: It took man over a million years to progress from using stones as he found them to the real- ization that they could be chipped and flaked to better purpose. It then took another 500,000 years before Neanderthal man mastered the concept of stone tools, and a further 50,000 years before crops were cultivated and metallurgy was discovered. Hence, by all scales of evolutionary reckoning, we should still be far removed from any basic understanding of mathematics, engineering or science – but here we are, only 7,000 years later, landing probes on Mars...So, how did we inherit wisdom, and from whom? And most mysterious of all, we have the following from the mouth of one of the acclaimed co-founders of the Theory of Evolution , Alfred Wallace himself: ... some intelligent power has guided or determined the development of Man And in the fascinating book Mankind – Child of the Stars, Max H. Flint and Otto O. Binder detail a very important anomaly: ...molybdenum, a very rare metal plays an important role as a trace element in the physiol- ogy of all Earth creatures. It is surprising, therefore, that life so dependant on a rare metal should arise on a molybdenum-poor world like ours... These acclaimed scientists, point out that there are many other specialists with serious doubts about the relation of Evolution Theory to the origin and ascent of Man. They state: ...we are not quarreling with natural selection...as it applies to other creatures...But we do state unequivocally that Darwinian Evolution and natural selection do not apply to mankind at all. They draw our attention to 35,000 years BC to the specific transition from the species of Neanderthals who were not our ancestors to Cro-Magnon who are believed to be. They write: And the greatest riddle of all comes up – where did Cro-Magnon Man, the first of our own Homo sapiens species, come from 35,000 years ago?

Neanderthal most decidedly could not be the direct ancestor of Cro-Magnon, for they were two distinctly different types of human, physically and even skel- etally.

Was replaced suddenly by Cro-Magnon, who was a completely separate species. ...Neanderthal most decidedly could not be the direct ancestor of Cro-Magnon, for they were two distinctly different types of human, physically and even skeletally. Neanderthal Man endured both cold and mild cycles with apparently equal success. He con- tinued to exist in western Europe right up to about 35,000 years ago, and then he abruptly disappeared. The evolutionary tendencies that he exhibited during this period are extremely puzzling. For he seems to have gotten more “primitive,” not less so. Classical Evolution theory simply cannot account for these two events. First, the abrupt dis- appearance of a whole well-entrenched species, plus the abrupt debut of a better species. Second, the fact that the Neanderthal species retrogressed and became more primitive as time went on. Natural selection and survival-of-the-fittest are square pegs that cannot be hammered into those round holes... These scientists are both convinced that biogenetic intervention and hybridization resulted in the demise of the Neanderthal and the sudden appearance of the much more sophisticated Cro-Magnon. And they are far from being lone speculators in the ortho- dox academic community. Dr. Robert Bloom, noted paleontologist, came out with a pronouncement that probably staggered all his colleagues, saying it was clear to him that evolution was accomplished not by natural selection or mutations but by: ...spiritual beings of various grades and various kinds of intelligence. This is an appropriate place to point out the reason why the term “Serpent” was and is used as a moniker for the Nephilim and their offspring. It refers to knowledge, especially of the arcane kind. It refers to the technological mastery that they possessed. Even in Hebrew, for instance, the root NHSH, that is, “serpent” means “to decipher,” to “find out,” implying that the Nephilim were scientists. The opposing sides both used and continue to use the serpent symbol, but with certain differences. The “Sons of the Serpent,” with the human DNA and human sensibilities, use the serpent usually in a winged form, or with a crown, or even as multicolored. Often referred to as the Uraeus, the Agatho Daimon, the Feathered Serpent, or even the Phoenix, it is a positive symbol, and like the dragon with five toes is connected to wisdom, white magic, and mystical practice.

After the creation of the “Adamic Race,” the Atlanteans felt confident that their colo- nization of the Earth was finally secure. They now had a subservient underclass that would labor and provide for them. Everything looked good. However, something happened that thwarted their plans for a third time. The “Sons of the Serpents” on Lemuria found out what their fathers were doing and about the newly created race that had taken their place as unwitting servants to evil. It occurred to them that such exper- iments were wrong and that this latest servant race was, although ignorant, part human and, therefore, “cousins” to themselves. It was decided that emissaries of the “Sons of the Serpents” would make contact with the new race. The experience of transport through Earth's atmosphere was recorded by some and passed down the generations in what are now considered fabulous tales of “chariots of fire.” The visions of the prophets Enoch and Ezekiel and the experience of Babylonian King Etana are related to these actual events and experiences. Members of the “Sons of the Serpents” entered the “Garden” to open dialogue with their cousins in bondage and spiritual ignorance. The male Adams were not that interested in the counsel of their visi- tors. But the females, the Eves, were. It is said that the Eves found the newcomers comely and attrac- tive. The visitors told those Adams and Eves who would listen that they were being kept in a state of induced ignorance and servitude, but that it was within them to become “gods” themselves, and that if they left the garden and came to Lemuria (Oce- ania), they would be shown all that had been hid- den from them and be awakened to their true natures. Finally, because of this intercession, a great multitude of the Adamic race did follow their wise visitors to their island paradise. They were taken to Lemuria by spacecraft.   Eden by William Blake"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 33 The Race of Adam Due to the relocation of the Adamic race, we find a compulsion in the psychology of humans to seek for some lost paradise or far away shore where life is sublime and untroubled. This instinct appears especially strong in members of the female sex. Because of the allegiance of the Eves and their curiosity toward the high mysteries, the Matriarchal cults of the Priestess began. These cults of power women existed down to Medieval times, when the Brotherhood of the Snake, under the guise of Catholicism, rose up to destroy them, en masse . The Eves have never been forgiven for their aban- donment of the alien hegemony. Their decision sealed their fate. That the compilers of the Old Testament and the creators of the Anthrocentric, monotheistic religions pro- pound the subservience of woman should be enough proof of whom they serve. The following passage reveals the wrath of the Atlanteans, not only toward their “first born,” but also toward the Eves: Because thou hast done this, though art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shall you eat all the days of thy life. (Genesis 3:14) In Eve’s scene at the tree...nothing is said to indicate that the serpent who appeared and spoke to her was a deity in his own right, who had been revered in the Levant for at least seven thousand years before the composition of the Book of Genesis. (Joseph Campbell, Occidental Mythology ) The appellation Satan, in Hebrew...belongs by right to the first and cruelest “Adversary” of all other Gods–Jehovah, not in the serpent which spoke only words of sympathy and wisdom. (Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky) Woman have always been marginalized and degraded in post-diluvian times, because of their allegiance to the “First Born.” The Book of Genesis reveals the intense hatred that the Bent Ones have toward the female. The tyrannies which have been perpetrated against wom- ankind through all the centuries, though disguised as a male versus female problem, are cer- tainly not at all confined to this, which is why very little is changing. The gender problem and dichotomy are but a carefully crafted manifestation of a greater malevolence, an all per- vasive ancient loathing for Earth’s original inhabitants. Once we approach the problem from its root, we will see progress. When we look back across the historical time of patriarchy...there seems to be some terrible inevitability, a relentless desire to crush the female essence, human and divine. The question of why is one of the most puzzling of our time...

This was the third time that their plans and exploits had been thwarted. First, they were banished from their home planet. Then after com- ing to a new one, they created a race to serve them, but which did not; and when they finally created the perfect servant, they found them permanently seduced away from their duties. The ire of the Atlanteans at this snubbing was so intense that they unleashed an atomic war on the “Sons of the Serpent” and their Adamic wards, now resident on Lemuria (Oceania). These latter were not unprepared, however, and being technically advanced, set up to defend themselves and retaliate against their evil adversaries on Atlantis. So, there was on Earth a nuclear war. It was an event that changed the face of Earth history. The war between the gods (the “Serpent Masters” and the “Sons of the Serpents”) and subsequent paroxysms were recorded by almost all the cultures of the world: And god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the Earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on Earth, and it grieved Him at his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon: and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not...and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the Earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

Under the evil insinuations of their demon Thevetat, the Atlantis race became a nation of evil magicians...the giants and magicians and all flesh died and every man. And author Jack Barranger also expresses the travesty of man’s perplexity: We have been lead to believe that the entity that the Old Testament describes as a mass mur- derer and heinous leader is the God of the Universe. We have been lead to think that the slaughter of human beings in the name of God is a divine act. And all through these passages is the reference to more than one god. A perfect exam- ple follows: Thou shalt not revile the Gods. (Exodus 22:28) Scholar and genius, Ignatius Donnelly wrote of the tribulations: It sounds like the cry not of a man but of a race, a great, religious, civilized race, who could not understand how God could so cruelly visit the world. And from Comyns Beaumont’s The Riddle of Prehistoric Britain : ...the prehistory of the Atlanteans and the race of Adam possessed peculiar similarities. The supermen of Plato’s island were drowned in a flood like the Adamites, the Giants of old time, men of renown, the men whose thoughts became wholly evil, destroyed in what is called the Flood or universal Deluge.

The Algonkian Indians relate: Long ago, two powerful Manitous felt themselves insulted by the hero Wisaka.

From Ovid’s Metamorphosis : Giants attacked the very throne of heaven...Jove struck them down. Three times had Poseidon (Neptune), ventured with stern countenance to thrust his arms out of the water; three times he was unable to endure the scorching heat of the air.

For nine days there was no exit from the palace and no one could see the face of his fellow...

The Egyptian scribe Manetho records information seemingly about the era of the Pha- raoh Amenophis, but which is really about a previous time: His...was an intensely dramatic era which culminated in a prolonged war, the invasion of his country by vast and well-armed hordes, accompanied by meteorological events of a phenomenal character, and finally ended in the Great Catastrophe which destroyed him and most of his nation. In Spell 316 of the Egyptian Coffin Texts, we find the following passages, referring to powerful destructive weaponry: So the gods were brought together, Re addressed Nun: Behold, mankind who came from my eye, have been scheming against me... Nun replied: O Re, if your eye was turned against those...how greatly would they fear you? Hathor said: I have prevailed over mankind and it is pleasant to my heart...

We read of weapons of strange power and magical properties, which literally needed several men to use. Their records give pronounced indications of genetic engineering in the tales of demonic hybrid entities, called the Fomorian Race, or Men of Lochlann, endowed with great powers, clairvoyance, and physical strength. We hear mention of “glass towers” from which the evil overlords could keep watch over the entire island. The later races subjugated the land of Ireland and its natives for centuries until they were finally overthrown. The Celtic word Fomhoraigh , means “giants,” and also derives from a term that means “from under the seas.” The myths say that the Fomorians lived under the ocean. Interest- ingly, one of the ancient names for the mythical lost isles was Tir fo thuinn , meaning “Land beneath the Wave.” One of these mysterious weapons mentioned in the Irish sagas was the Lance of Lugh, the sun god. Lugh was called Ildanach, or “Master of all the Arts,” but also the “Far- Shooter.” Here is a description of his strange lance: He also had a magic spear, which...he had no need to wield himself, for it was alive and thirsted for blood...When battle was near it was drawn out; then it roared and struggled against its thongs; fire flashed from it...it tore through and through the ranks of the enemy, never tired of slaying. (See Celtic Myth and Legend by Charles Squire ; The Book of Con- quests, and The Silver Arm by Jim Fitzpatrick.) Another weapon of power was the sword of the high king Nuada, called Retaliator. It is the prototype of Excalibur. Retaliator was said to vibrate in the presence of negative forces or enemies. The Celts had the strange prohibition that no king could rule who was “blemished.” This does not make sense until we realize what it relates to is genetic alteration. The high king of the Gaels, Nuada himself, had to step down as leader after his arm was severed in the titanic war with the Formorian hybrids. He sub- sequently had his missing limb replaced with a “silver arm.” The astonishing account of this limb’s “magical” replacement clearly bespoke some form of advanced cyber- netics. (See Celtic Myth and Legend by Charles Squire.) The Greeks and Teutons, as so many others, also have records of hybrid beings that had the countenance of either great beauty or ugliness.

Opposing the demons was the god Shiva, who, it is recorded, possessed a powerful weapon that he fired at the enemy airships from his own. In the ancient Ramayana, there is mention of an iron thunderbolt capable of killing hundreds of thou- sands of humans. It was also said to be so powerful that it could have destroyed the Earth. These weapons could only be used by royal decree. There are even passages where it mentions the fact that the weapon was used as retaliation for the other side using it first . In another Vedic tome called Samarangana Sutradhara, there is mention of manned space rockets, as well as their means of propulsion. In the Samara Sudradhara, we find mention of the use of biological weapons, each of which pro- duced its own specific effect. The Samhara debilitated its victims by attacking the motor center of the brain, and the Moha caused blockage of nerve impulses, resulting in complete paralysis. In the Chinese Feng shen veni – i, we find similar descriptions of germ warfare, and again reference is made to specific weapons causing specific results. The Indian philosopher Aulukya discussed in his teachings the miniature solar system within the atom, molecular construction and transformation, as well as the The- ory of Relativity, more than 2800 years before Einstein. From the epic Mahabharata , we read the following astonishing passage: It was as if the elements had been unleashed. The sun spun round. Scorched by the incandes- cent heat of the weapon, the world reeled in fever. Elephants were set on fire by the heat and ran to and fro in a frenzy...water boiled, animals died, the enemy was mown down and the raging of the blaze made the trees collapse....Horses and war chariots were burnt up... Thousands of chariots were destroyed, then deep silence descended on the sea. ...The corpses of the fallen were mutilated by the terrible heat so that they no longer looked like human beings. Never before have we seen such a ghastly weapon and never before have we heard of such a weapon. When the Mahabharata was to be translated in the last half of the nineteenth century into modern languages, the descriptions of ancient warfare were generally expunged. His Saubha clung to the sky at a league’s length...He threw at me rockets, missiles, spears, spikes, battle-axes, three-bladed javelins, flame-throwers, without pausing....The sky...seemed to hold a hundred suns, a hundred moons...and a hundred myriad stars. Neither day nor night could be made out, or the points of compass."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The World Falls Dead 44 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation And again: ...This weapon was so feared that “in great distress of mind” the king had the bolt reduced to fine powder and thrown into the sea. Even with these precautions, peoples hair and finger- nails fell out overnight, birds turned white and their legs became scarlet and blistered, and food went bad... Gurkha flying in his swift and powerful Vimana hurled against the three cities of the Vrishis and Andhakas a single projectile charged with all the power of the Universe. It was the unknown weapon, the Iron Thunderbolt, a gigantic messenger of death which reduced to ashes the entire race of the Vrishnis and Andhakas... The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable. Their hair and nails fell out; pottery broke without apparent cause, and the birds turned white. After a few hours all foodstuffs were infected...To escape from this fire the soldiers threw themselves in streams to wash themselves and their equipment... (Protap Chandra Roy's translation of 1889) In the 1950s the father of the Atomic Bomb, Robert Oppenheimer (who frequently quoted the Mahabharata ), was asked by a student at Rochester University, whether his Atomic Bomb was the first in history to be exploded, he suggestively answered: “ We l l yes, in modern times, of course.” Add to these accounts, those of visitations and even space journeys, like those of Ezekiel, Enoch and Etana, and others. Moreover, how does the detractor explain the presence of radioactive tektites and isotopes at the very sites now known to be the Bib- lical Sodom and Gomorrah and Jericho? What of the strange radioactive corpses found in Mohenjo Daro in India, the descriptions of which accord perfectly with what was seen in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. What are we to make of the presence of fused glass in Scotland, Iraq, and Libya? Tektites found at these and other locations continue to confound the experts. In the Libyan desert, fused glass (radioactive tektites) were dis- covered and then analyzed by Dr. R. V. Dolphin. After studying the Lybian Desert glass, Dolphin suggested that for the ancient Phoenicians to have worked with temperatures equivalent to 6,000 degrees Celsius, they may have known the secret of atomic power. (See page 115 , The Atlantis Blueprint by Colin Wilson and Rand Flem-Ath) . Six thousand degrees Celsius is only 2,000 degrees less than the temperature of the sun. In the same place was found jars and vases which had been fashioned in the same manner as one would see clay. The only difference was that these artifacts were made"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 45 The World Falls Dead of some of the hardest substances known, basalt, quartz, and diorite. The necks of the vases were so narrow that no hand could have been used to fashion their interiors. High temperatures had to have been employed. But how is still a mystery to the experts. Exceptionally high temperatures are also needed to remove impurities from gold. Scientists were perplexed when necklaces found in the Libyan Desert were made of 100 percent pure gold. The answer to all this is what was suspected by the good doctor, but which most academics are very reluctant to accept; atomic energy was indeed known and used in the days of old. Researchers and authors, Valdamar Valerian, Charles Berlitz, J. J. Hurtak, and David Hatcher Childress, relate hundreds of accounts such as this in their pivotal works. In the account of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the fleeing prophet, Lot, is told by the “angels of the Lord” not to turn back, because the “wrath of the Lord” was coming to that place. Lot’s wife does look back and is straightaway turned into what is described as a “pillar of salt.” But this is a mistranslation. The word is more like our English “vapor.” Add to these the accounts of the walls of Jericho, or the story in Exo- dus of the ten plagues, not to mention the entire books of Job, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Revelation, which are full of catastrophe and godly wrath. With all this and an endless amount more, it becomes practically and rationally irrefutable that a war of the gods did indeed take place in pre-diluvian times, when ferocious weaponry was possessed and used by both sides. There is good reason to believe that the terms “Sodom” and “Gomorrah” originally referred to Atlantis (Appalachia) and Lemuria. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven. And he overthrew those cities, and all the plains, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. (Genesis 24-26) And again, mention of weapons: O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt. He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow shall strike him through. (Job 14:24)"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The World Falls Dead 46 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation, Woe unto us! Who shall deliver us out of the land of these almighty Gods? These are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness. (Samuel 4:8) That the ancients had weapons of power has been a fact long sequestered by the elites. Authors who have sought to expose the facts have been persecuted, ridiculed, and had their works suppressed. One of these master researchers was Comyns Beaumont, who wrote the following: I have said comparatively little in regard to the prehistoric science in weapons, including firearms, although it is manifest that they played the most vital part in ancient “power poli- tics...possession of the knowledge of metallurgy must have been one of the most urgent yet secret objects on the part of those who desire to rule the ancient world...I cannot overstress how vital and important is always the problem of weapons. In his book Interpretation of Radium, the great physicist Fredrick Soddy wrote: Can we not read in them some justification for the belief that some forgotten race of men attained not only the knowledge that we have so recently won, but also that power that is not yet ours?...I believe that there have been civilizations in the past that were familiar with atomic energy and that by misusing it they were totally destroyed. The Smithsonian Institute and the Bureau of Standards in Washington finally proved that over 7,000 years ago, steel was made in furnaces which burned as hot as 9,000 degrees centigrade. But those who have read the Book of Enoch will recall that the contrivance of metal and weapons had different origins than any modern scientist is going to publicly espouse. And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives and shields and breastplates and made known to them the metals of the Earth and the art of working with them...and they were lead astray, and became corrupt in all their ways. The war of the gods is recorded in the Bible. Veiled references to it include the term, “first born.” This euphemism turns up in the Old Testament. We read of Jehovah, for instance, striking down the “first born” of the Pharaoh for Moses. Later, in the New Testament, Herod goes after the first born of the so-called Israelites in his search for the Christ child. Few ask what is productive in attacking those without any sin, when the resources would be better used striking at the actual enemy. Little in theological"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 47 The World Falls Dead texts will make sense until that which is literal is distinguished from what is not, when primary usages of a word, phrase, or term are distinguished from secondary or tertiary usages. “First Born” relates to the original progeny of the “Serpent Masters,” that is, the members of the Lemurian Race. Things become easier still when we identify the “Serpent Masters” with the “Race of Jehovah” and the “Sons” with the “Elohim.” Elohim, comes from Ellu, meaning “the Shining Ones.” “Shining Ones” is an ambivalent term used for both the Nephilim and their first born. The “Shining Ones” are often depicted with horns on their heads. This was a symbol of wisdom, but also of rulership. This is why shamans, priests, and kings adopted the convention of wearing horns also, especially in the form of the crown. This was to primarily indicate that they were descendants of either the Atlanteans or the Lemurians and were endowed with power. Michelangelo sculpted Moses with horns on his head to indicate his blood-bond to the ante-diluvian kings. Every scholar must be aware that there are two distinct styles— two schools, so to speak— plainly traceable in the Hebrew scriptures: the Elohistic and the Jehovistic. The portions belonging to these respectively are so blended together, so completely mixed up by later hands, that often all external characteristics are lost. Yet it is known that the two schools were antagonistic. (Madame Helena Blavatsky , The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 3 ) Many cryptic terms are used to describe the adversaries and their conflict. Many seem- ingly incomprehensible motifs and anecdotes from the world’s legends can be made lucid once the reader knows what is really being implied. And this was comprehended by the American master of the pre-diluvian epochs, Ignatius Donnelly, who demon- strated his discernment, concerning the terrestrial tribulations, when he wrote: It sounds like the cry not of a man but of a race, a great, religious, civilized race, who could not understand how God could so cruelly visit the world. This fact can be corroborated by a close reading of the Old Testament. In it, we hear of the strange meeting Moses had at the “burning bush.” This has long been a point of conjecture, but can easily be explained when the imagery is replaced by fact. Jehovah announces to Moses’s question, “ I am the god of thy Fathers .” Scholars have pointed out that Moses’s doubt as to the nature and pre-eminence of Jehovah is strange, to say the least, and that Jehovah should need no introduction to a devoted Israelite. More- over, the introduction clearly implies that Moses is in fact one of the progeny of the “Sons of the Serpents” (his “fathers”), but has now had the misfortune to come into contact with one of their fathers, that is, one of the original “Serpent Masters,” maybe"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The World Falls Dead 48 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation even the “main man.” The second revealing anecdote happens when Moses and Aaron are in the presence of the Pharaoh. The scriptures speak of them having to prove their credentials to Pharaoh by changing Aaron’s rod into a serpent. This is strange, since Israelites were forbidden by Jehovah to engage in “magical practices.” Anyway, the Egyptians produce their own rod, which likewise becomes a serpent, and so on. This tale of the conflict between the two serpents is a barely disguised reference to that between the races. The same motif appears in the Arthurian sagas, with the contest between the red and white dragons, which is the dream of Uther Pendragon, father of King Arthur. The very name Pendragon means “Head of the Dragons,” that is, the race of good “Serpents,” from which the Celts and Gaels descended. Other cultures have similar leitmotifs expressing the same story. The Saxon tale of St. George and the Dragon is a perfect fictional rendition of it. In the Old Testament, passages relating to the twins, Jacob and Esau, may well refer obliquely to the pre-diluvian bipartisanism and their ongoing antagonism. In your limbs lie nations twain, Rival races from their birth; One the mastery shall gain, The younger o’er the elder reign. The meaning behind the euphemisms of the combating “Serpents” or “Dragons” has to do with the antagonism within the biology of the Homo Atlantis. The reference is to the coils of DNA, to the alien and human strands and their incompatibility. The folk- tales which have to do with the evil and good twin, the dark and fair sisters, the white and black witches, the twin towers, the true and false knights, the heroes descent and ascent, etc., also conceal the same meta-theme. From Robin Hood to Swan Lake, from Hercules and the Hydra to Jason and the Golden Fleece, from the Odin hanging on the “Winding Tree” to Conan the Barbarian, from Alice Through the Looking Glass to Dungeons and Dragons, the themes are ONE. What is the Tree of the East and the Tree of the West? What are the two seraphim who guard the Ark of the Covenant? What are the gates of Valhalla? Why are there twin columns at the portals of illustrious edifices? What do the swastika, the double-headed eagle, the Masonic double cube, the double- barred cross of Lorraine, the two Knights Templars riding one horse, really signify? What are the real “Pillars of Hercules” that guarded the way to Atlantis?"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 49 CHAPTER 7 Records of Blood and Stone Of central importance to the proof of the war between the gods is the purely scientific accounts of the devastation that affected the Earth’s flora and fauna: What then has exterminated so many species and whole genera? The mind is at first irresist- ibly hurried into the belief of some great catastrophe; but thus to destroy animals both large and small...we must shake the entire framework of the globe. No lesser physical event could have brought about this wholesale destruction not only in the Americas but in the entire world...Certainly no fact in the long history of the world is so startling as the wide and repeated extermination of its inhabitants. (Charles Darwin - quote from journal, Voyage of the HMS Beagle ) Animals that had been native for millions of years disappeared under circumstances that were suspiciously sudden...the loss of over 30 genera of large mammals...and many other species of large animals in North America alone. (Paul S. Martin , Who or What Destroyed Our Mammoths ) At the end of the Pleistocene about 10,000 years ago, there was an extinction event that dec- imated the large terrestrial mammalian herbivores and carnivores of North America, South America and Australia. In North America alone, more than 32 genera of mammals became extinct ...The cause of this extinction is debatable... (R. W. Graham, Evolution of New Eco- systems at the End of the Pleistocene ) However ingeniously and with whatever subtlety we may deal with our evidence, the facts constrain therefore to one inevitable conclusion...the mammoth and its companions perished by some wide-spread catastrophe which operated over a wide area and not through the slow process of the ordinary struggle for existence...not the result of gradual accumulation...but the result of one of Nature’s hetacombs on a grand and wide-spread scale, when a vast fauna perished simultaneously. (Henry Howarth , The Mammoth and the Flood, 1887) From the masterpiece, When the Earth Nearly Died , by scientists Alain and Delair: In Europe immense herds of diverse animals utterly vanished off the face of the Earth for no obvious biological reason..."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Records of Blood and Stone 50 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation ...Coincident with this dreadful slaughter upon the land was the deposition of myriads of contemporary marine shells, and the stranding at great elevations of marine mammals, por- poises, walruses and seals. In Siberia, “the picture is everywhere one of appalling disorder, carnage and wholesale destruction, with countless animals and plants frozen in positions of death ever since the day they perished. As a result, their remains are amazingly fresh-looking and are frequently indistinguishable from those of animals and plants that have died mere weeks ago. The magnitude of the biological extinctions achieved by the Deluge almost transcends the imagination. It annihilated literally billions of biological units of both sexes and every age indiscriminately. Only incredibly powerful flood waters operating world-wide could have achieved such results, and only a flood produced by the means previously suggested could have operated globally. ...it is astonishing that such an unscientific explanation ever came to be formulated, yet in a short time both it and the concept of immense thick ice-sheets descending from a hypotheti- cal northern mountain system, to cover all of northern and eastern North America and west- ern and northern Eurasia, was enthusiastically embraced...as virtually established fact. The evidence is perfectly unambiguous. Along with the removal of an “Ice Age:” like that which has been hitherto commonly envisaged, the evidence suggests that there is something seriously amiss with the last phases of standard geological chronology. Evidence thus converges from numerous directions to support the conclusion that, on the tes- timony of radio-carbon and other dating techniques, immense physical and climatic changes occurred on Earth some 11,000 years or so ago – when an Ice Age that probably never existed came to an end, and an apparently uniformitarian regime was abruptly terminated. The gigantic worldwide tectonic disturbances of the ‘late Pleistocene’ times occurred almost simultaneously on a near unimaginable scale – precisely what could be expected from a powerful external influence but not from the ‘Ice Age’ conditions conventionally believed to have existed then. Significantly, a drop in the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field appears to have occurred sometime between 13,750 and 12,350 years ago...attended by various other important changes, including earthquakes, vulcanism, water table fluctuations and large scale climatic variations. Of these, severe earthquakes in particular may even induce axial wobble, and polarity reversals."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 51 Records of Blood and Stone Studies have shown that at 10,178 BC, or over 12,000 years ago, the celestial Pole was inclined at an angle of 30 degrees from its present position. This in turn strongly suggests that the terrestrial axis then oriented differently from today. Archaeologists all over the world have realized that much of prehistory as written in the existing textbooks, is inadequate, some of it quite simply wrong... What! No Ice Age which came and went, spreading over hundreds of thousands of years as all good geologists proclaim? No smothering ice sheets which enveloped the British Isles and much of the northern parts of the Continent, changed the climate to Arctic conditions - although, strangely enough, much of our fauna and flora survived despite it - and compelled all the survivors to flee? No lengthy periods of ice alternated with warm and even sub-tropi- cal climatical interludes? No. Nothing of the sort. There was admittedly a tremendous con- vulsion of nature, which had the most direful effect upon the inhabitants of Scandinavia, the British Isles, and those in Northern Asia. It resulted in giving us, it is true, bitter cold, tre- mendous floods, and cruel dampness. That it affected the climate in the north adversely and permanently cannot be denied. It did other things as well. But no Ice Age. (Comyns Beaumont, Riddle of Prehistoric Britain ) It was an event...sudden, rapid, devastating, and appalling in its magnitude, and destruc- tiveness. It was a celestial impact of an immense cometary body... It rained or distributed rocks, stones, boulder clay, till, gravel, sand, and other material over great areas, utterly obliterating certain parts, elevating others, and entirely missing some regions. It created islands, drowned others, caused immense tidal waves which swallowed up coastal lands, consumed huge spaces with electric waves, set up volcanoes, and swept away cities and largely populated districts almost in a flash. (Ibid) It has been suggested...that the changes now at work in prehistory herald the shift to a “new paradigm,”...made necessary by the collapse of the first paradigm... (Colin Renfrew, Before Civilization ) When we hear of the coming of the angels of the Lord to humans, like Manu (India), Satyaravata (India), Khasistra (India), Yima (Iran), Noah (Semetic), Deucalion (Greece), Dwyfan (Wales), Nuada (Ireland), Bergelmir (Scandinavia), Coxcox (Mex- ico), and Nata (Aztec) warning of the coming deluge, we must understand that it is members of the “Sons of the Serpents” who brought the warnings and not , as is believed, the representatives of Jehovah."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Records of Blood and Stone 52 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 53 CHAPTER 8 I Shall Reverse the World Now if we are to answer the question of how evil has really come into the world and if it is correct to state that it did so because of alien interaction, then the question appro- priately arises as to how we are still battling with the problem of evil today. Why is it not all over and done with given that the conflict began in pre-diluvian times? Surely, if “evil” had conquered, then today there would be no question of “good” being an alternative or a presence in the world. And if “good” had triumphed, then today we would all be living in peace and harmony. The reason why we are still resolving this today, why good and evil still operate side by side, personally and collectively, is because there was a variable, in the days of old, that prevented resolution. This variable was unforeseen by either side and caused the end game to be delayed, literally by millennia. The variable had to do with the global war mentioned previously. The use of the weapons of mass destruction caused the planet Earth itself to react vio- lently. It is written that the ferocity of the war caused the very moisture in the atmo- sphere to completely evaporate. The air was literally incinerated or irradiated. It was either this conflagration or some other related event that effected the Roche Limit, and which caused a dramatic alteration in the magnetism of the Earth. As a result, the Earth deviated on its normal orbit and upset the movement of other neighboring plan- ets and bodies. The course variations allowed debris from the previously destroyed planet, Tiamat, to re-enter the Roche Field where it fell to Earth, again causing havoc. Much of this effluence was salt water from the once vast oceans of Tiamat, thus caus- ing the second deluge of prehistory. These global cataclysms caused the polar axis to alter, resulting in the great “Pole Shift” that destroyed almost all the flora and fauna on the planet. This event is universally recorded and is now scientifically confirmed. (See When the Earth Nearly Died. )"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"I Shall Reverse the World 54 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation The warlocks of Atlantis, who were never many to begin with, suffered heavy losses in the destruction of their continent, Atlantis. It can be conjectured that there were less than 100 of these totally alien beings left, though there is little to no certainty about this. They also lost most of their sophisticated alien technology. And the “Sons of the Serpents” together with their Adamic wards suffered enormous casualties also. It may be conjectured that there were only about 1,000 true “Sons of the Serpents” left in existence. This global war and its devastation also meant that the Earth would now have a differ- ent climate, equator, and continental placement. The great continents of Appalachia, Oceania, Tyrhennia, Beringia, and Fennoscandia sank beneath the waves, as did smaller islands such as Lochlann, Lyonnesse, Hy Brasil, and Avalon, to mention a few. The great Miocene Ocean that occupied most of what is today Russia had entirely emptied its basin. Its waters became the Mediterranean, and the Caspian and Black Seas. The waters of the planet Tiamat, after pouring into our atmosphere, helped to submerge the continents and eventually became the great oceans we have today. And so, the great pre-diluvian civilizations once occupying these continents were gone for- ever. The pillars of heaven were broken-the Earth shook to its foundations-the heavens sunk lower towards the north - the sun, the moon and the stars, changed their motions-the Earth fell to pieces, and the waters enclosed within its bosom burst forth with violence and overflowed it...the grand harmony of nature was disturbed (from Astronomical Revelations by Larry Brian Radka) . The Quiche Indians of Guatemala recorded this event as follows: The waters were agitated by the will of Hurakan, the Heart of Heaven, and a great inunda- tion came...masses of sticky material fell...the face of Heaven was obscured and a heavy darkening rain began...There was a great noise above, as if by fire. Now men were seen run- ning, pushing each other, filled with despair... And, the Bible, in its customary oblique and disheveled manner, records it thus: The Earth is utterly broken down...moved exceedingly. (Book of Isaiah) For this they are willingly ignorant of...the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.

(Isaiah 24) I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. (John 21, 22) The Laplanders of northern Sweden preserved these accounts. Their ancient books have God saying: I shall reverse the world. I shall bid the rivers flow upward; I shall cause the sea to gather together itself up into a huge towering wall which I shall hurl upon your wicked earth-chil- dren, and thus destroy them and all life. From maverick catastrophist and researcher Comyns Beaumont, we read: The Flood, to the world generally a vague and nebulous tradition, really conceals the most appalling visitation and its ravages in the British Isles and Scandinavian lands may be retraced to more considerable extent by the effects of what geologists term the “Drift” Age. It was no mere ice drift. It was sudden and terribly swift and violent. It took several hundred years for any sense of normalcy to return. These events are still etched in the human race memory, in our very DNA. Man’s various nightmare fears and daytime phobias arise from such physiological experiences in the ancient past. Fear of thunder and lightning, of the dark, of water, of caves and enclosures, of loneli- ness, or spiders, insects, and other creatures, fear of the ocean, of silence, of strange peoples, and so on, come from this. The myriad omens and superstitions, found in every clime have their roots in these collective experiences. Julian Jaymes, author of “The Origin of Consciousness and the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind,” claimed that this period thousands of years ago was a time of intense psychosis for the emerging human race. (Jack Barranger , Past Shock ) . The coming of the original “Serpent Race” was probably around 50,000 years ago (but could have been as recently as 30,000 years ago). Genetic experiments and hybridiza- tion took place some time after the building of Atlantis, for which the services of Neanderthal Man seems to have been required. The wars of the “gods” probably began around 13,000 years ago, with the Pole Shift following soon after. The Earth attains a semblance of normalcy as the centuries pass."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"I Shall Reverse the World 56 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Later the historical period commences, post 11,000 years. In the historical or post- diluvian epoch, humankind seems a strange mixture of primitivism and advancement. All the incredible inventions with no seemingly antecedent stages of development. These symbols have been both revered and feared for millennia by almost every cul- ture on the globe and yet, outside the folk traditions themselves, there is no credible theory to account for why that should be. Are there not a myriad other things worth worshipping? Why is it that so few scholars have dealt with this anomaly? Another interesting anomaly of these cultures is the use of the letter and phonetic sound “K.” (See also “C” and “CH.”) Almost all the names of the tribes of the north American Native Indians have the “K” sound or letter, for example: Oklahoma, Muskogian. Choctaw, Nakota, Dakota, Cherokee, Mohawk, Yaki, Comanche, Chickasaw, Seneca, Iroquois. The word America has the strong “K” sound, as do the words Celt , Cain, Caan, Cham, Khan, Cohen, Canaan, Conn, Carn, Clan, Kieran, Karen, and Christ . There are many personal names that also have it.

As the histo- rians and mythologists have known, these sundry cultures and their beliefs bear curious yet undeniable similarities, mainly because contingents of the same people were spreading the knowledge to these different locales—same people, similar paradigms and symbol- ism. Commensurate with this comes the ambiguous symbols of the snake, the serpent, and the dragon.

And it is upon the foundations of these dynasties and cultures that the post-diluvian or historical periods rest. The horrendous events that are associated with these belligerent nations aptly testify to who was behind them. And since it was these Brotherhoods that began recording history, they commissioned the accounts to be composed in their favor, to be biased toward their deeds and agenda. Their aristocratic scions were to be history’s main dramatis personae . As a result of their bias, the date of their arrival was artificially pushed back to over 400,000 years. This was a political move to give their line ancestral supremacy. The biographies of the “gods” and the details of past events were also embellished and distorted, while the facts pertaining to the happenings in the Garden of Eden were doctored to the absurd form that exists today.

However, this had to be done in a more limited manner because their technical hardware had been largely destroyed in the wars. They also studied why things had gone so wrong for themselves since their arrival and first experiments. They decided that their main error was the experimentation on Homo Sapiens (also Erectus, Cro-Magnon, etc.) for it was certainly that which brought them problems. But humans were not the only life forms on the Earth. So, it was decided that experiments would be made on animal DNA instead. They began looking to the fauna, making genetic tests on certain animals. It was found that the DNA of the reptiles was the most suitable for their purposes. The alien masters then crossed their own DNA with that of certain reptiles, and it is from this that the “Reptilian” (dragon) beings of the story- books were born. And on Earth shall be monsters, a generation of dragons of men and likewise of serpents. (Clement : Apocalyptic Fragment ) In the Babylonian Legend of Creation, we read: Men with bodies of birds of the deserts, human beings with the faces of ravens, these the gods created and in the Earth the gods created for them a dwelling...in the midst of the Earth they grew up and became great, and increased in number. Atlantis researcher Andrew Collins provides the story of Amram, father of the law- giver Moses, who had a personal encounter with such beings or their masters: I saw Watchers in my vision, the dream-vision. Two men were fighting over me, saying... and holding a great contest over me. I asked them, `Who are you, that you are thus empowered over me?’ They answered me, `We have been empowered and rule over all mankind.' They"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Reptilians, Priestesses, and Strange Genes 60 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation said to me, `Which of us do you choose to rule you?' I raised my eyes and looked. One of them was terrifying in his appearance, like a serpent, his cloak many-colored yet very dark... And I looked again, and... in his appearance, his visage like a viper, and wearing...exceed- ingly, and all his eyes... The Reptilians preferred to live beneath the ground or in dark caverns, their needs being seen to by other genetic mutants or even by compliant Adams who still remained in the ignorant state. They periodically demanded live sacrifices to be made to them and would go in search of the enemies of their masters. Some of these genetic creations had wings, others were polymorphic. So, we have it contained and recited in most of the myths that the archetypal “hero” comes into conflict with a beast, a great serpent, or hybrid demon. Their combat is the staple method of proving prowess. It became a custom that when a prospective hero did overcome one of the dragons, that they would wear the symbol of the serpent on their heraldic shield or banner, in the same manner as the native Indians collected and wore human scalps. The hero was then also considered “blooded.” Many of the demeaning “hazing” rituals of so-called upper-classmen are throwbacks to this concept. When the moral “Sons of the Serpents” in their diasporas came upon a welcoming tribe or a suitable place to reside they set up their base. It is from these regions that we find traces of great advancement, amid later primitivism. At these new locations, the “Sons of the Serpent” would also continue their genetic studies and work. They had “fixed” the Adamic peoples so that they would be intelligent and creative. They also made it possible for the Eves to reproduce sexually. This was primarily to pacify the normal urges of the now freed male Adams. And it is known that members of the “Sons of the Serpent” would “mate” with the Eves, producing exceptional progeny. The “Reptilians” did indeed serve their masters well. They were part alien, part reptile, with no human DNA at all. Some, like their creators, looked entirely humanoid. Others were distinctly reptoid. They operated from the limbic mode of consciousness and possessed the physical endur- ance and strength, not to mention the guile, of the humble Earth reptile. From these beings, we inherit the term “cold- blooded evil.” Zeus and Typhon"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 61 Reptilians, Priestesses, and Strange Genes The euphemism that has come down to describe a female reserved for crossing with part alien being was “virgin.” The offspring of these relations were referred to as being of “virgin birth.” Other terms which implied genetics are “Blood” (as in “Blood of the Lamb”), “Seed” (as in “Seed of David”), and “Immaculate” (as in the “Immaculate Conception.”) This latter term connotes progeny who were created genetically, rather than sexually. Properly, it was to designate that they were special children, the off- spring of the gods. Eventually, the “Sons of the Serpents” interacted with human women in the normal sexual manner. The progeny of these conceptions were always regarded with awe and even fear. For instance, in the Book of Enoch , we read of the birth of Lamech’s strange son: I have begotten a strange son. He is not like an ordinary human being, but looks like the children of the angels of heaven to me. His form is different and he is not like us...it does not seem to me that he is of me but of the angels... Behold, I thought then within my heart that conception was due to the Watchers and the Holy Ones...and the Nephilim...and my heart was troubled within me because of this child. Lamech's father, Mathusala, eventually consults the prophet Enoch about the strange grandchild. The latter says to the concerned grandfather: This child which is born to you shall survive on the Earth, and his sons shall be saved with him. When all mankind who are on the earth die, he shall be safe. And this posterity shall beget on the earth giants, not spiritual, but carnal. Now therefore inform thy son Lamech that he who is born is his child in truth; and he shall call his name Noah, for he shall be to you a survivor. In his work called Metamorphoses or the Golden Ass, we read about the god Apollo saying strange words regarding the birth of the goddess Psyche: On some high crag, O King, set forth the maid, In all the pomp of funeral robes arrayed. Hope for no bridegroom born of mortal seed But fierce and wild and of the dragon’s breed There is even some evidence of cloning experiments in the Bible: And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the Lord God had taken"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Reptilians, Priestesses, and Strange Genes 62 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man...And Adam said. This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. (Genesis 2: 21) From almost the first genetic experiments, there were hardly any fully human beings alive on Earth because the pre-visitation Engis and Neanderthals were mostly annihi- lated, apart from a small contingent kept alive to perform the most menial and labor intensive tasks such as building and mining. These beings were treated in an appalling manner. Eventually (apart from some intriguing references to Hollow Earth exist- ences), there would be only full alien and part alien, part human DNA in the Earth’s humanoid species. The Eves who were receptive to the counsel of the “Sons of the Serpent” in the garden became the first that were “awakened” and exalted by their more advanced cousins. They were initiated into the secrets of technology. The word secret comes from secretion , meaning fluid of the body, particularly the female menstrual fluids. The concept and phenomenon of the “Holy Grail” comes from the myster- ies of the female cults after their residency with and tuition from the “Sons of the Serpent.” It is from this exodus to Lemuria that we have the great female cults, when females were chief initiators, oracles, and keepers of the mysteries, which is recorded even in the Arthu- rian romances of later ages. Celtic myth is full of anecdotes about the warrior queens who command great magical abilities. That this was changed in historical times is due to the supremacy of the evil masters again taking control of civic and cultural events. The hybrid progeny of the original fully alien masters could also eventually reproduce both sexually and genetically. Many dynasties and their tyrannical “royal” lines and leaders owe their exist- ence to this, as a close study of their symbolism, deeds, and history reveals. This is the origin of the royal or “holy bloodlines,” like the Merovingians, Hapsburgs, Hanoverians, and Guel- phs (Windsors). The ubiquitous walking on the long red carpet or standing on the red-square and cutting the red-tape are maintained as cryptic references to this bloodline. The “Serpents” had great physical strength and stature and could live for many hun- dreds of years. A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, who can stand before the children of Anak. (Deuteronomy 9:2)"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 63 Reptilians, Priestesses, and Strange Genes The Arabian historians spoke of the strange Adites: They were depicted as men of gigantic stature; their strength was equal to their size, and they easily moved great blocks of stone. (Lenormant and Chevalier, Ancient History of the East, Volume 2 ) In July 1877, four prospectors moved through along the hills of Spring Valley near Eureka, Nevada...Using their picks, the prospectors soon chipped out human legs and foot bones that had been encased in solid quartzite...from knee to heel, the bone was thirty-nine inches long. (Charles Berlitz , World of the Odd and the Awesome ) A human skeleton 17 feet tall was discovered at Gargayan in the Philippines. (From Matrix II by Valdamar Valererian) When one of these curious beings finally passed on, the survivors would erect a great monument in their honor. We know these structures as the cyclopean temples that are found in places of ancient civilization. These edifices are not tombs, but cenotaphs. They are “biographies” in stone. Their amazing harmonic and geometrical properties were encoded therein, as a means of commemoration to the life and acts of the great being in whose honor the building was erected. The death of one of the original nega- tive aliens was attended by similar rituals. The places on Earth where one of these original aliens were laid became a zone that later experienced great upheaval and con- flict (like Northern Ireland and Palestine, for example). Scientists and biologists in the service and pay of the Elders of Atlantis have been continu- ally desecrating these sacred temples. Many have paid with their lives, as there are powerful apotropaic spells working around the structures. But the object is to extract DNA samples from the mummies to further their present nefarious necromantic experiments. The “Serpents” possess great knowledge of geomancy and constructed their sites and cities with precision. The Nazca lines in Peru and the Glastonbury and Kingston zodi- acs are evidence of this knowledge. The secret fraternities have preserved these geo- metric secrets for many centuries. Later, as the Atlantean sorcerers gained power again and were successful in infiltrating a culture established by their humane scions, they would instigate the atrocity of human sacrifice. Appearing and presenting themselves as the gods of the “fathers,” they would seduce and then ritually slaughter countless thousands. The unfortunate victims would not resist, as they were under the impres- sion that the gods were angry with them for some disobedience.

All over the world, we read of the scenario of a once exalted civiliza- tion suddenly descending into debauchery and bloodlust, whereas we rarely hear or read of the reverse taking place. As mentioned above, the phenomena of evil came into the world and into the con- sciousness of humankind via genetic manipulation. From that moment, every human being had to deal with an inner dichotomy, had to decide which proclivity to choose, the human or the alien. This is the choice we are each still making. The “good” feel disturbed by the negativity in their natures and have striven to curb it. The “evil” feel as disturbed by their conscience and seek to suppress it in a variety of ways. And what goes on within the individual manifests collectively. The inner predicament has its environmental concomitant. The post-diluvian empires, nations, and states are designed from the Atlantean pattern. All the abhorrent phenomena that plagues Earthly life today have their origins in these times. After the second deluge (Pole Shift), the roles of the genders changed. The proclivities of the male became exalted and women slowly suffered the removal of their power and status. Aggression, violence, and conquest became dominant. Meat eating (unheard of in the pre-diluvian epoch) was necessary during the times of tribulation and was later maintained. Class divisions were established, slavery was again pro- moted, blood sacrifice compelled, carnality indulged in, and the subjugation of nature exalted into a veritable religion. Coming down from these times, commensurate with the artificial municipal life, were the vast mind-control strategies that are still today in evidence. The Urantia Book and others provide a commentary on the life of human- kind in the post-diluvian epoch: Acquired inheritance, cities and industry, domestication of animals, practical family organi- zation (male at the head), racial and cultural separatism, strong executive head, military strength, conquest and territorialism and enslavement of foreigners. ( Urantia Book ) States are as the men, they grow out of human characters (Plato) Perhaps we will never fully understand the mystery of that original mutation from egalitar- ian to state society. Certainly no standard explanations are adequate. (David Watson , The Pathology of Civilization ) In individuals, insanity is rare, but in groups, parties, nations and epochs it is the rule.

The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion. (President John Adams) From the advent of the first historical empires, over 10,000 years have elapsed. We have long attempted to answer the dilemma of evil and its permutations. We have been lead to believe that it is a natural, if pernicious, part of life, something we each have to work out as we exist and evolve. We are made to think that evil comes into being because of the erstwhile movement of nature. We do not see the ramifications of this false contention. If we embody it, then we subliminally regard nature and its order as ontologically inferior. Nature is ignorant we think. If it could bring about a propensity in its highest creation that undermines its own order, then, by implication, it cannot be intelligent or worthy of reverence and care. It is this attitude which then leads to the desecration of nature, animals, and indigenous peoples as well. The Druids did not permit themselves the luxury of cutting a single living thing with a sharpened edge. Compare this to today’s savagery and carnage. In a sincere desire to discover the origins of evil and in a need to circumvent the drive, personally and collectively, we have turned to the philosophers and to the scientists and priests. For all their musings and pontification, the academic philosophers have come up relatively empty when providing clear understanding of this matter for all humanity. Science does not exalt the moral question to any intense degree. Scientists cannot even find consensus on the mysteries of the physical Earth. Orthodox geolo- gists have generally failed to account for anomalies pertaining to the origin of life, of the hominids, the later genus Homo, and the fossil record. The alumni of the Earth sci- ences consciously manufactured the fallacious theory of the Ice Age and the Pleis- tocene Epoch. They advocated “Uniformitarianism” stating what they knew to be untrue, that geological and evolutionary changes take place over extremely long peri- ods of time and at very slow rates. The concept of the Ice Age does not come any-"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"What Goes on in the Bible? 66 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation where near to accounting for the paroxysms that occurred on the Earth and are recorded in the legends of the native peoples. It was concocted to lead people astray from the realization of occurrences that not only shaped the Earth but that impacted humans physiologically and psychologically. Moreover, the elitist world of science has brought its fury to bear on the lives, careers, and advancement of their detractors, genius mavericks, and revisionists, such as Immanuel Velikovsky, Ignatius Donnelly, and Comyns Beaumont. Edmund Halley was the first scientist to account for the Bibli- cal Deluge by polar displacement: When he first argued his case before the Royal Society of London in 1692, the revelation was so startling that his paper was not published until 30 years after. (Larry Brian Radka , Astrononomical Revelations ) Those diligent scholars who have done their homework jettisoned the “Ice Age” the- ory as completely untenable. Since 1995, the science is in proving that there was nei- ther a “Pleistocene Epoch” nor a long lasting “Ice Age” of the type habitually advocated ( see Appendix B ). It is our belief that the hypotheses and theories promoted by the establishment scholars were always known to be inadequate and scientifically suspect, for it is far beyond the dictates of reason that Darwin, Wallace, Aggasiz and Lyell, etc., could get their facts so wrong by mere accident. The reasons why things went so wrong is understood when it is realized how much was at stake for the establishment if scholars and the masses should ever connect the destruction on Earth with the coming of extraterres- trial entities. The descendants of these visitors are now in total charge of the Earth and obviously deem it essential that the history of the Earth, of its geospheric and topo- graphical evolution, be made to appear the result of gradual changes and the effects of ice that descended upon the northern continents. It was of paramount importance that humans did not look back to the pre-diluvian epochs. For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither anything hid, that shall not be known and come abroad. (Luke 8:17) To get the word out, their opponents have had to resort to fiction and fantasy, to music and film, in which they tell the tale, knowing that it is unlikely that the average reader or viewer will go beyond their entertainment value, or indulge in deeper, heuristic analyses."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 67 What Goes on in the Bible? Those of a questioning bent, disenchanted with the quandaries of materialistic science, frequently turn to religion. Its representatives have lauded themselves as having the question of evil in hand, as possessing the special abilities and knowledge, which alone address mankind’s epistemological conundrums. For 2,000 years, Christianity and the major religions have sought to account for the presence of evil. They have not succeeded in giving us any clear answer. In attempting to answer one question, they have fostered thousands of new ones. And some might argue that along with science, religion is one of the most adroit exponents of evil in the world today. And indeed, when we review the canon of Christianity, we have good reason to feel frustrated. One may well ask, what is going on in the Bible? Let us then take a brief look. We are told by the religions that man has two natures, good and evil. One is then com- pelled to ask why God would instill such propensities in his own creations who are made in his image? We read that God created man and woman. This implies that God is not man or woman “himself.” Yet, consistently, the post-diluvian religions all over the globe, constantly depicted and referred to God as male? They do this even when, in the case of Hebrew, the name for deity is of feminine gender. We are told that man was not originally evil. He became that way after the disobedi- ence of Eve in the Garden. Why would God create something born in his image and then deny him some aspect of knowledge and then even banish him from paradise after it had been received? We must also ask why God would condemn his creations for something that was not a conscious transgression? Why the tests imposed on those who must already be inno- cent in nature? Then we are told that the parents sinned, only after they fell under the influence of the evil one, Satan. So we ask, why would God allow his newly created beings to be in the proximity of this “evil one?” Who created the serpent? Nowhere in the Genesis account is there any mention, direct or indirect, of Satan’s involve- ment, and yet it has become common practice for the Church to portray the serpent as an emissary of Satan, or even as Satan himself. (Laurence Gardener) "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"What Goes on in the Bible? 68 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Why would God himself know evil, before man was even created, unless God had already brought evil into the world? Why, as we read in the Book of Job, would God give Satan, a being that cannot be trusted, the right to test Job? Why would God not already know whether Job was a true servant or not. Is there a limit to the omnipresence of Jehovah? One cannot also conceive of the reason for the existence of any being, like Satan, who has no good in him at all. What would be the point of creating such as being, or in sending him to test those who themselves must be morally pure? If Satan could even have the ability to aspire toward supreme Godhead, and if there are hierarchies of angels, etc., then perhaps God can indeed be surpassed? What are we to make of this? We find that Jehovah told a lie. Eve did eat of the prohibited “tree,” but did not, as was warned, die. So how and why would a God that puts such currency in morality tell lies? God promised Noah after the Flood that he would never visit the world with like calamity again...but there have been innumerable devastations unleashed on earth, which taken together would rival and even surpass the horror and death-toll of a pre- historic aeon. Why does God create mankind and then lamenting his great evil nature proceed to destroy all his creations? Why not confine the act to mankind alone? And would it not have been simpler to create man and, thereafter, not expose him to sin? If it is true, as the Bible declares and theologians state that the “sin” involved Adam and Eve being made conscious of their “nakedness,” does this mean that God and the Serpent and the others that were around were clothed? We read that Cain after slaying Abel is banished forever by the Lord, but is then endowed with the “mark” to prevent anyone from slaying him. But why would the Lord want Cain’s life spared? How would anyone know Cain’s past deeds and want to kill him? And how could any “mark” matter one way or another? Is there a mark that"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 69 What Goes on in the Bible? denotes that one has committed fratricide? And furthermore, who would be in the position to kill Cain, since he and his parents were, supposedly, the only beings alive in Creation? We read that when Moses encounters Jehovah at the “Burning Bush” God tells his prophet that He is the “God of Thy Fathers.” How can this be? And what does it mean? Moreover, why does Moses ask to know God’s name, if the “Chosen People,” the Isra- elites, already knew it? Among the many Commandments that were levied by Jehovah was one categorically forbidding “magical” practices by any of the “Chosen.” Why, in this case, were Moses and Aaron doing the “rod and snake” trick in front of the Pharaoh and his priests? Where do the exceptions begin and end? Why does Jehovah, who commissioned Moses to secure the freedom of the “Chosen People,” then continually “harden Pharaoh’s heart” to prevent their easy release? Does this not smack more of human politics? Why is it that we read of Jesus experiencing Baptism from John? Why would the sin- less son of God need to go through a ritual that is reserved for the sinners seeking repentance and conversion? Jesus openly rebuked all public prayer. So why was this made the staple thing in later Christianity? There is no precedence for celibacy in the Bible, so why did this become vogue in Christianity? And what of the character of Jesus? We are told that he is the embodiment of love, compassion, and forgiveness. But we read of him turning over tables, talking about bringing a sword rather than peace, and stating in Luke: But those mine enemies which would not that I reign over them, bring hither and slay before me... And regarding the mission, destiny, and message of Christ, why would God send his son, a pure soul, into the so-called vale of death to rise again from that state back to the godhead that he already once enjoyed? Was this necessary for the simple transmission"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"What Goes on in the Bible? 70 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation of a spiritual message? What would be the purpose of such an exercise? What does it say about the omnipotence of the God of the Testaments? If paradise could be lost once and then regained, what is to prevent the scenario repeat- ing ad infinitum ? And what of the character of Yahweh (Jehovah)? Is there not inconsistency there also? If he, Jehovah, is in reality the only God or the only real God, then why the constant remonstrations about worshipping other gods. What would Jehovah have to fear? Is it the free will of people that is remonstrated against? According to conventional interpretations, does he not banish Satan and human sin- ners to perpetual agony in hell? Satan could not be the creator of hell, for nowhere does it say that he was, and if he was, why would he stay in it? Is Jehovah not the cre- ator of both evil and hell? Nowhere in the text does it state the contrary. And if God is good, why send any of his creations to everlasting perdition for any reason? Why not just destroy that entity, since, according to Genesis, this is what was done to the first creation. Surely, this would be less misery to the wretch. God condemns eternally and his mortal creations suffer interminably for the slightest moral deviation or infraction? So we ask, who is evil, the one who acts it out, or the one who created the propensity in the first place? Does it not seem strange that the God who promised to take care of all his people and never bring another deluge would be so conspicuously absent during all the subse- quent horrors of history? So it goes on and on throughout the Bible text. No wonder that Pliny the Younger when asked by the Emperor Trajan about Christianity replied that it was a: ...degenerate sort of cult taken to extravagant lengths. I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of...Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbe- lieve them all.

I have examined all the known superstitions of the world, and I do not find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Chris- tianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make one-half the world fools and the other half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the earth. (Thomas Jefferson) The clergy converted the simple teachings of Jesus into an engine for enslaving mankind and adulterated by artificial constructions into a contrivance to filch wealth and power to them- selves...these clergy, in fact, constitute the real Anti-Christ. (Thomas Jefferson) What influence in fact have Christian ecclesiastical establishments had on civil society? In many instances they have been upholding the thrones of political tyranny. In no instance have they been seen as the guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to sub- vert the public liberty have found in the clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate liberty, does not need the clergy. (President James Madison) Thanks to scholars, we now know that the Book of Genesis is a simulacra of earlier Sumerian, Akkadian, and Egyptian originals, in which the experiences of the dramatis personae are suggestively similar. The net result is that the Christian hegemony has no answer for the existential predicaments of man. In fact, they have made these worse. They espouse no answers or remedies that do not themselves foster the repression of the natural instincts. Surely, after 2,000 years of such labyrinthine diversions, theolog- ical nonsense, and prevarication, it is time to hand out the “pink slip” to the representa- tives of religion and pay no more mind to their hyperbole. One would think that this leaves humankind in a void when it comes to the question of evil and its exact origins and denouement. But it does not. As I have shown, the ancients had more than enough to say about the coming of evil into the human arena. Behind the veneer of fairy folklore, of myth and legend, lie the answers."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"What Goes on in the Bible? 72 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 73 CHAPTER 11 This Place is Terrible!

Is the great war still going on and is the end-game perhaps in sight, to be concluded in our own time? Many authors, who have made researches into the subject of alien visitation, such as Brinsley Le Pour Trench, Erich von Daniken, and Zacharia Sitchin, continually assert that the Annunaki have left this planet and are one day to return to save us from our- selves and correct the injustices and wrongs of humankind. These authors believe that the alien “gods” are essentially benevolent; that they are, in fact, our elder brothers with our welfare at heart. This author is, however, far from subscribing to these and other kindred theories. Along with Comyns Beaumont, William Bramley, C. S.

In the following section, attention will be drawn to some of the ways that they do this. In their creations they continually emphasize that they and their forefathers have been engaging in a veritable “Battle of Armageddon.” This battle is going on every second of every day. It is not yet won by the light bearers because we, the children of Earth, against the very coding of our DNA are as yet resistant to taking up arms against our deadliest enemies who have kept and will continue to keep us in utter servitude. It is time to draw Excalibur from the stone again. But do not wait for any King Arthur to return from the physical grave. Arthur is us, Arthur is you! Upon investigation, we find that there is much evidence to indicate that the alien visi- tors and their dark progeny have been and still are with us, that they are, in fact, at the very helm of the echelons of society, making use of powerful secret societies, such as the Masonic and Rosicrucian fraternities as their cover for centuries. It has been uncovered that the members of such bodies permeate and influence all areas of gov- ernment, politics, education, religion, and business. This has been the case certainly since the Renaissance. It is for the individual reader to decide for themselves, whether such fraternities and enclaves, even whether the entire occult genre, were before, or are now, under the control of the progeny of the Atlantean Nephilim. It is the contention of this author in his present state of understanding that it is unlikely that occultists and occultism have been, or are, exclusively in the hands of the Atlantean offspring, and although people may be evil, symbols and edifices are inher- ently not. Clearly, both sides make use of the same machinery. In the final analysis, it matters little what weapons are used and what field is chosen for battle. It matters greatly though–to know the enemy .

(Albert Pike, Grand Master of American Scottish Rite Freema- sonry) In spite of the efforts of Science Fiction and Fantasy writers, it appears that humans are very far from a complete understanding of the forces that have shaped history or the evolution of terrestrial societies. Because they are in charge of the world’s media, the alien masters have been industrious and successful in putting Atlantis in front of us as a long lost paradise, where wise priests presided over semi-enlightened, sublimely contented people, at one with their environment. If one’s discrimination is, however, still operating and if one has read through the masterpieces of Tolkien, MacDonald, Le Guin, and C. S. Lewis, it will be realized that these tales of Atlantis are pernicious fic- tion. They are part of an ongoing propaganda campaign, accepted by those within the “New Age Movement” who have been duped by the nostalgic reveries of bygone days and golden ages where all was peace and plenty. It is a truism that mankind is at home in nature, not in any kind of metropolis. This probably holds true for all ages on the Earth. It is commonly known that many persons involved in the sciences are overwhelmingly cold blooded and inhuman. But such persons are also found in the political, sociologi- cal, and psychological sciences. They are found involved in the medical professions and they are behind many other industries. They appear to be the paradigm authors in modern times, leading mankind to destruction with every new diversion. Are such beings the progeny of the Necromancers of Atlantis? Are they “Homo Atlantis” who chose to hearken to the alien DNA instead of the homo sapiens strains? Are these sci- ons of ancient sorcery involved in the governments and media today?"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 77 This Place is Terrible!

We also looked into the probable manner in which evil came into the world and into the personality of man. We hinted that it may not be at all natural, meaning that it may not arise due to the inviolate forces of nature, but only from perpetual and unnecessary tampering with, or circumventing of, such forces. For why would nature “create” a phenomenon so inherently destructive to herself? But more pressing for us at this point is the reminder that the resolution of the"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"This Place is Terrible! 78 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation war between the forces of good and evil was not concluded in pre-diluvian times. The “Dark Ones” were drastically reduced in physical numbers and they had lost most of the technology that channeled their powers. What was left of this computer hardware was often sequestered in areas that we now refer to as the inner sanctum of a temple, or as the “Holy of Holies,” etc. Only the “initiated” could enter such precincts, others being threatened with death and damnation if they became curi- ous and dared. The Biblical references to the Arc of the Covenant and Moses’ warnings about its powers clearly denote some kind of unpredictable and deadly radioactivity. It is also rumored that the arc contained the remains of the leader of the “Fallen Angels” or others of his 200. The word arc comes from arche, meaning the first, the original, or even, the orig- inator, and also from arca, which translates as “tomb.” And the Israelites declared the so-called arc to “contain” God himself. Words like arcadia, monarch, archon, and arktos contain this strange prefix . The loss of the majority of this technology was of singular irritation to the alien visi- tors and was sorely lamented. And so, in the post-diluvian times, they set about ener- getically manipulating events that we now read as history to bring them to the point where they could reproduce the technological hardware that was so invaluable. This is an act that was begun by the Council of Elders in Asia Minor over 11,000 years ago. They have compelled us to the heights of technological expertise at the expense of other areas of human development, as lamented by innumerable philosophers, roman- tics, social critics, and activists. I wonder why progress looks so much like destruction. (John Steinbeck) The major advances in civilization are processes that wreck the societies in which they occur. (Alfred North Whitehead) Regarding the practicality of their meta-plan, they knew it would take centuries to come to fruition. However, there was no choice but to commit to it, since it meant that they could finally vacate their prison Earth and roam the infinite skies, or perhaps even return to their own planet. The Renaissance, the Industrial Age, and the present Silicon Age stand as testaments to their success. It is our belief that the end game is to be played out in our times and that it is in fact being played out as we write. Unfortu- nately, this is not the place to chart the entire machinations of these beings from 11,000 years ago.

They had to leave in a hurry, so as not to be hindered by the cosmic forces which would be unleashed throughout the solar system. Because of their haste, they did not have time to precisely scan the planet Earth, and so they did not locate their enemies hidden deep within the caverns and beneath the seas of pre-diluvian Earth. The masters of the Nephilim were relatively convinced that even if their enemies were on Earth they could not survive the paroxysms and furor that Tiamat’s obliteration would bring on. However, these unknown pursuers did not just leave our solar system without instigating precaution- ary measures. Before they made the journey back to their own planet, they established an etheric barrier around our planet that would be along the same orbit trajectory as the Moon’s around the Earth. This barrier still exists and is utterly impenetrable to the Atlantean progeny, because the technology by which it was erected was of an extremely advanced level. From that time onwards, the Moon would come to represent (in almost all cultures) arcane powers of protection and magic. This apotropaic barrier, often referred to as by native peoples as the “the great web in the sky,” was put there obviously to prevent the Atlanteans from ever leaving this place. The Earth was to be their tomb. The higher angelic intelligences which rule our solar system may have erected the cosmic barrier after relative normalcy had returned to the planetary grid. The facts are not clear as to how it got there or what agency is really responsible. C. S. Lewis refers to this barrier and the quarantine of the “Bent Ones” in his writings, terming the Earth tomb of the aliens, Thul- candra (the “Silent Planet”). Before their discovery of the existence of the “Stargate,” the Nephilim intended to one day vacate this planet that has long been their terrible prison. They did not come here by choice and have not had a good time of it since their forced arrival. They have been"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Stargate and Quarantine 82 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation as the Bible relates, “chained into the pit.” It is their intention to break their chains and change galactic address as soon as the technology exists to make this possible. (One would do well to notice how many movies and how much art and corporate designs embody the theme of release from some form of captivity). God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment. (Epistle of Peter) The descendants of the Atlanteans were giving themselves a pat on the back during the Renaissance. They were satisfied that they had taken control of the planet economi- cally and were making good progress toward reconstructing the science and technol- ogy they once enjoyed. In fact, as writers such as William Bramley have pointed out, they even had the ability to build craft for flying out of the Earth’s atmosphere. It was at this point, or probably some time before, that they discovered the existence of the “Stargate.” They then realized to their horror that even if they were able to success- fully reproduce all the advanced hardware they required, they probably could not leave the planet anyway. This knowledge caused them intense displeasure and confu- sion. They may have come across the Stargate by attempting to go beyond it, having at least one of their special crafts destroyed. Such an event seems to have taken place in Siberia more recently. In Mankind, Child of the Stars , the authors detail an account of a strange, previously unexplained accident: A very huge and puzzling “meteorite” fell thunderously in Soviet Siberia on July 30 th 1908....peasants heard the awesome explosion as far as 620 miles away. A large area of for- est was flattened as if an immense object had fallen...No remnants of the alleged meteorite could be found anywhere underground...radioactivity had initially been released in enor- mous amounts...the general destruction showed that the energy released had been far greater than the mere impact of a falling stone, no matter how huge...Most significantly, the aerial path of the falling object had not been uniform but had amazingly changed during descent. Various Soviet scientists then put forward an amazing theory – that it had been a spaceship, driven by intelligent beings and loaded with a great power from a nuclear power plant, which had exploded through some accident. There is some evidence from the Bible and other scriptures that the presence of the Stargate may have been known earlier, but this is impossible to confirm at this time. The prolonged industriousness of the “Serpent Masters” seems to point out that they believed themselves able to leave when the time was right. Therefore, passages, like the following from the Babylonian Legend of Creation, which connote their internment on Earth, can refer to the loss of the hardware and not specifically to the quarantine situation and the Stargate."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 83 Stargate and Quarantine I descend...to the house of darkness, to the dwelling of the god Irkalla: To the house entering which there is no exit...the place where dust is their nourishment and their food mud. Its chiefs also are like birds covered with feathers...in darkness they dwell. (Legend of Cre- ation) When the predicament of the Stargate was fully accepted, the scions of Atlantis knew something had to be done, lest all their aeons of effort and tribulation would be for nothing. They convinced themselves that what technology could erect, technology could eventually take down. It became their avowed and solemn intention to move humanity forward to the point where it became intellectually evolved and capable enough to develop the high technical sciences that could expedite their freedom. So, it was decided by the Royals of England, the Tudor Dynasty, that though their present researches and operations would not be halted, a new approach was needed. The man with the idea for this new approach and the one who would undertake its execution was Sir John Dee, the court astrologer and ambassador of Queen Elizabeth Tudor. Elizabeth (E- Liza -beth) was known, suggestively, as the “Virgin Queen” (said to do with her being a Virgo), but really because the term indicates bloodlink to the “Serpent Masters” and possibly to the Reptilians. The name Elizabeth means “beloved of the Gods.” Sir John Dee was court ambassador to the Tudors (sic, Tutors). He would dutifully visit for- eign courts, meeting with money men and master occultists of Europe, and then when send- ing back intelligence in writing to the court, he would sign his letters with the sigil 007 . John Dee was a spy by royal appointment, literally, “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.” The mod- ern MI5 comes from his time, as do many other idioms and customs that are taken as English today. ...His library at the riverside village of Mortlake was considered the finest private collection in Europe containing thousands of bound books and handwritten manuscripts devoted to philosophy, science and esoterica. In comparison, the University of Cambridge at the time had a mere 451 total books and manuscripts in their possession. (D. W. Cooper & Lawrence Gerald)"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Stargate and Quarantine 84 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 85 CHAPTER 13 The Living Macroscope Sir John Dee, one of the greatest satanic occultists that ever lived, was extremely well connected throughout the Europe. Along with Edward Kelley and others, he set about opening portals to other dimensions in order to speak with the “angels.” His fraternal counterparts in Europe, under his instruction, performed similar rites. Their obsession was to contact extra-terrestrial, or preferably, pan-dimensional beings, the “Archons.” To do this, he invented what was known as “Enochian Magic” which, due to their adroit camouflaging, has been misunderstood to this day. Look through the quaint images and see the truth of this. These wizards and warlocks were involved, and are still involved, with the summoning of pan-dimensional entities, who were mistaken in the days of antiquity as demons and angels (see the classic British Sci-Fi series Dr. Who, specifically the following episodes: Planet of the Spiders, Daemons, Masque of the Mandragora, Snakedance, Terror of the Zygons, The Silurians, Face of Evil, State of Decay, Return of the Mara, Pyramids of Mars, Horns of the Nimon, Nightmare in Eden, etc). Strangely, even with the brave attempts of writers and movie-makers, it still comes as a shock to most to realize that the quaint anecdotes of “magic” in the Renaissance and Eliza- bethan periods are actually references to science. Sorcery and science are not as discon- nected as is commonly insinuated, and it is not happenstance that almost all of the pre- Industrial scientists, cosmologists, and chemists were master occultists. When one takes a closer look at the personalities behind the occult societies of the Elizabethan age, for instance, an interesting picture begins to form. Competent researchers or students of the Occult, of Enochian Magic, etc., recall how often the magical sigils resemble, or actually are , planetary and cosmic symbols. The full reason for this has long been concealed. The magic of the Middle Ages and the necromancy of the Dark Ages was for the same purposes as the technomancy of the modern age. The practitioners and their lackeys are all of one clan with the self-same agenda. When we hear of magicians in their circles of protection sur- rounded by planetary sigils and calling out the barbarous names of Archangels and familiars, we must realize that this has to do with very physical phenomena. Let us look now beyond the masque to see what lies at the origin of these specific occult sciences and why the profu- sion of occultism among the European aristocratic intelligentsia at this time."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Living Macroscope 86 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation “Enochian” magic is named after the Old Testament prophet, Enoch. But the name actually goes further back to the Sumerian Enki, one of the original Annunaki. It is more than signif- icant that Dee chose this name for his divination. Sir John Dee was actually successful in his enterprise. He succeeded in opening his portal and entering into dialogue with oversouls from another dimension. This was not the first time in Earth history that this had been attempted, nor would it be the last. Every time it occurs the consequences forever alter the course of history, usually for the worse. In the late Elizabethan Age, or shortly thereafter, the opening of another interdimensional portal was necessitated. This time it was undertaken by members of the “White Brother- hood,” the descendants of the “Sons of the Serpents,” the Lemurians. They were attempting to counterbalance and assuage the attempt of the “Bent Ones” and to ask for guidance them- selves that they may be successful in countering the influence of their nemesis. (See “Epi- logue: Time to Change the Road You’re On” on page 129.) Sir John Dee entered into dialogue with these pan-dimensional intelligences to see whether he could learn from them the secrets to a higher form of technology, which would precipitate the escape from Earth of his masters. As a living “macroscope,” Dee found out that these pan-dimensional beings did indeed have answers. C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien both knew that aliens were in total control of post-diluvian Earth, that they had replicated a race of Dragons or Reptilians, that they were, since the exper- iments of the Elizabethans, in league with pan-dimensional entities. The latter, Lewis called them “Macrobes.” Mankind, he said, takes for granted the world of the microbe. Though not visible to the naked eye, one has merely to make use of the microscope to confirm their exist- ence. However, on the level “above” the human, exist the Macrobes. These cannot be seen with the naked eye either. Their existence is known, or intuited, by the subtle inner faculties of the sensitive or clairvoyant. The word Enochian literally means “inner eye.” Lewis implied, that no one can ever come into an understanding of the peculiar history of planet Earth without a knowledge of these entities. But Dee also discovered that the Macrobes did not take well to being contacted by creatures so lowly and presumptuous as he. His mind was nearly destroyed by the communion. The knowledge that the Dark Archons communicated through his con- sciousness was so vast and complex that it was soon, thereafter, realized by all con- cerned that it would literally take centuries to physically realize. It had to be decided whether to just give up altogether and remain interned on Earth forever, or to"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 87 The Living Macroscope somehow try, against all the odds, to actualize the complex details of what was being relayed. The Tudor Dynasty elites with assurances from Dee elected to press on. They put the most gifted minds at their disposal to the task of decoding into practical terms the strategies given from the “beyond.” Others were commissioned to come up with camouflage strategies to hide what was going on from those not privy to it and from members of the Lemurian offspring. These adepts were skilled in magical practices and could keep in contact with each other then, as they also do today, via telepathic resonance: Their close world-wide cooperation has been maintained by instantaneous intercommunica- tions by telepathy which is taught them. (Ekial Kueshana , The Ultimate Frontier ) The notorious antics of some of these characters were indulged by intellectuals and nobility throughout Europe. They could literally get away with murder, because they had the sanction of the highest in the land. Their occasional run-ins with the law or the more conscientious descendants of the “Sons of the Serpent,” like Christopher Mar- lowe, did not trouble them much either. Marlowe was finally dispatched by his ene- mies. It was the task of these intellectuals, these court appointed or royal affiliated alche- mists, necromancers, diviners, and clairvoyants to translate into pragmatic strategies the voluminous instructions that were transmitted. Entire societies were established in respect of this purpose. The controversial adepts and alumni, such as William Black- house, Elias Ashmole, Robert Boyle, Tom- masso de Campanella, Cagliostro, Comte St. Germain, Sir Kenelm Digby, Cornelius Drebbel, Robert Fludd, Casinova, Nostroda- mus, Machiavelli, Cornelius Agrippa, etc., were more often than not, either the creators, or the members, of so-called “Invisible Col- leges,” and often in the employ of the plutoc- r a c y , t h e s e l f - n a m e d “ B l a c k V e n e t i a n s . ”         Stargazer "},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Living Macroscope 88 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Eventually, it was realized that no single scholar or group could hope to unravel the complex data in one lifetime and that for many centuries scholars would have to con- sciously and unconsciously work on the material. They solved the problem by creating the bastions of learning which we now know as the great universities of the world. These were not opened for the good of the world or for the spiritual uplifting of all mankind. They were seats of learning and research for the pan-dimensional data. Along with many churches and monasteries, universities became the epicenters for collation of the myriad researches that were frantically going on throughout the globe (see or read The Name of the Rose ). These “colleges” housed and preserved the infor- mation gleaned through time. To make sure that only initiates had access, the Masonic-based “fraternity” structure was instigated. Virtually all the Royal Society founding members were Freemasons. One could reasonably argue that the Royal Society itself, at least in its inception, was a Masonic institution. (Michael Baigent, Holy Blood and Holy Grail ) It was only much later to stifle curiosity and prevent class war that the universities were finally opened to the masses. The study of the architecture, symbolism, and geomantic posi- tioning of the world’s great seats of learning, such as the Smithsonian, comprises an entire subject in itself. One of the personalities that was set to work on the Magnum Opus of the Atlantean Necromancers was Francis Bacon, whom some consider the father of modern science. In fact, the new scientific paradigms that came out of this period, the laws that were “discovered” about the universe and the nature of biological life, mostly arose from these thinkers and specialists recruited by Europe’s Black Nobility to work on the meta-plan. To cover this up it has been put before us that there are certain times in history when, for no apparent reason, knowledge of a kind flourishes and similar ideas become vogue. It is possible that many of the figures of early science were in the employ of the Dark Brotherhood. History reveals how many scientists were adroit occultists. And so are they today also, although it is very well covered up. The descent into our world of this knowledge on a wholesale level gave rise to the Age of Enlightenment and the Indus- trial Age. In fact, like Marlowe, William Shakespeare was also aware of what was going on behind the façade of events. Cryptically, he referred to the occult plan in his plays and seems to have warned against it. Shakespeare’s plays contain complex"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 89 The Living Macroscope alchemical and occult anecdotes, yet, for some strange reason few academic scholars have drawn proper attention to them. There is also the controversy of the actual identity of Shakespeare. It has been surmised that the personage responsible for the plays was none other than Sir Francis Bacon, but that has not been confirmed. It is more likely that an exceptionally gifted descendant of the “Sons of the Serpents” was responsible for them. The works themselves contain encrypted ciphers which may reveal the authorship. ( Francis Bacon--Our Shakespeare and Francis Bacon and His Secret Society by Mrs. Henry Pott, The Bible Fraud by Tony Bushby) The information transmitted (channeled) by the pan-dimensional oversouls was that there were indeed keys to the “Stargate.” But what these were and the manner of their implementation was not immediately attainable. In fact, the Macrobes revealed that mankind would have to continue to advance technologically to the point where the secrets of how energy turns into matter could be studied and mastered. However, to even begin to understand the permutations of this first goal, centuries would first have to be spent learning about the exact opposite phenomenon–how matter becomes energy. This was the motivation behind the majority of Post-Industrial scientific research and experimentation and, obviously, not because mankind was evolving for the first time toward technical mastery. Phase one of Macrobe lesson one was finally concluded when the Atlantean demigods succeeded in splitting the atom in the 1950s. A study of the lives and careers of those involved with atomic energy, like Leo Szilard and Robert Oppenheimer, will prove an interesting line of research for those interested in corrob- orating our disquisition. Only now, after almost a millennia, are they capable of embarking on the discovery of the reverse–how energy becomes matter. Sun Microsystems (with its suggestive serpentine logo), SRI, and MIT are three of many cor- porations, funded by the Black Nobility, which are fronts for this research. Secret Societies are a presence not only behind industry, but governments also. The symbol for the present European Union, for instance, was first suggested for the flag of the United States of Europe by the super-secret Priory de Sion, which is said to be headquartered in France. The grand masters and illustrious members of this order are descended from the medi- eval Merovingian kings who dated their ancestry back to the Israelite, King David.

The relationship between carbon and silicon, it was revealed, was one of the most important denominators to the problem. The main obstacle was the availability of this and other minerals. To avail this element, and to use it in the correct manner, was not at all in the capability of the Elizabethan intelligentsia, not even to those with alien DNA. Even the beginning steps were nigh on impossible to actualize. Sir John Dee, however, convinced his masters that it could be done, that he had seen the future, and that success was attainable in time. He said that their own lives should be laid down, if necessary, to ensure the glorious end game. His instruc- tions were that the entire planet Earth would have to be owned and stripped of its nat- ural resources to procure the wealth and power needed to create the means for carrying out their long-term plan. So it is from this time in history and from such a small island that an empire begins. England set out to create its giant exploitative empire, which extended its tentacles to the corners of the world and ruthlessly and efficiently subdued nations and cultures who stood in its way. The Hudson Bay and East India consortiums were founded, the great trade routes opened, and the human slave trade instigated. Countries were then ruthlessly and systematically looted of their natural wealth which was carried back to England and added to the vast stores that had been sacked during the Roman con- quests, the Norman invasion, and the Crusades of previous centuries.

Its purpose is also one of occult significance. When Dee entered into communication with the supernatural intelligences, he was told that there was a price for the knowledge he was to be given, a price for continued assistance throughout the ages. The oversouls wanted something and that something was “blood.” Blood has occult properties, especially when it is taken from an innocent, murdered in a ritual setting (see Highlander and any of the Dracula movies). Blood is a form of energy and vampires live on it. Blood is very important to occultists. Hence, the emphasis that ancient societies and priestarchies placed, and now modern criminal syndicates, place on it. It is not a coincidence that the word “Blood” is the second most common word in the Bible, after “God.” No blood, no deal! So Meister Dee with his colleagues and underlings saw to it that his Dark Guardians would get all the blood they required. In his great pact, he put the whole of mankind up as the sacrifice to his masters’ cause. This is the reason for the endless wars and conflicts that beset world history. Wars are precisely planned blood rituals, with all seemingly opposing sides being financed by the same unseen echelons. (See Dr. Who – State of Decay .) To provide the physical resources and the human sacrifices, the Pirates ( Men of the Fire ) were financed by the Tudors and set loose onto the high seas to conquer foreign shores and intoxicate or murder and enslave those whom they encountered. Some of their deeds bear clearly ritualistic patterns. It is a fact that the leaders of these Pirates were aristocrats of the Tudor dynasty. One was called, suggestively, Sir Francis Drake (Drake means Dragon). The Pirates colonized America and subsequently their mon- eyed descendants (known as the Russell Trust) formed the “Ivy League” universities for the education of their own offspring. Secret fraternities were established to main- tain hierarchy and prestige, but also to make sure that only the “right” candidates made it into the inner sanctum to learn the truth. The “Skull and Bones” of Yale University is"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Their Satanic Majesty’s Request 94 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation one such Faustian fraternity. Many presidents, politicians, and industrialists belong to it. A Yale is a strange hybrid animal, often seen on royal heraldry. Another enclave is called the Bohemian Society and whose emblem is the owl. This creature, appears in miniature, on the American one-dollar bill and is described as an appropriate secret society totem, because it can “see things in the dark.” For more on this controversial subject, see the works of Jordan Maxwell, Anthony Sutton, Lyndon La Rouche, and Eustace Mullins. (See Bladerunner and The Brotherhood of the Bell. ) The Government of this country has not only to deal with governments, kings, and ministers but also with secret societies, elements which must be taken into account, which at the last moment can bring our plans to nought, which have agents everywhere, who incite assassina- tions and can if necessary lead a massacre. (Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield) It is useless to deny, because it is impossible to conceal, that a great part of Europe – the whole of Italy and France and a great portion of Germany, to say nothing of other countries – is covered with a network of these secret societies, just as the superfices of the earth are now being covered with railroads. (Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Beaconsfield) The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceed- ings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers, which are cited to justify it. (John F. Kennedy, address to newspaper publishers, April 27, 1961). There exists a shadowy Government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fund- raising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of the national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself. (Senator Daniel K Inouye) Another strategy used through the centuries was the spreading of the plagues among the peoples of the world. The medical professionals have been one of the most effec- tive agents in the bloody rituals, and it will shake the world to its very foundations if the full story of their malevolence ever becomes known. And there are other kinds of malign individuals operating at the behest of the “Brotherhood of the Snake.” These vampiristic criminals are still operating in the streets of all major cities, torturing their victims and offering them as sacrifices to the Dark Macrobes. Mind Control is a method which has long been refined by the Hidden Masters, and they use it constantly and in many permutations. Many of today’s so-called “serial killers” are performing, consciously or unconsciously, acts that have their roots in the darkest of rituals."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 95 Their Satanic Majesty’s Request When the Macrobes were contacted, they emphasized that mere killing was not sufficient. The deaths have to be conducted in a ritualistic fashion. This means that the method of kill- ing is important, but so is the place of execution. And this last point is very important. If a victim is not slain ritually, their energies cannot be absorbed by the Macrobes. For instance, soldiers (one of the best kind of sacrificial victims) are adorned with ancient occult symbols (like pentagrams and acorns, etc.,) to wear, not so they can appear handsome, but that they are correctly “marked” when they enter the place of the black mass. (These sites were also strategically chosen, but not in the way the student of battle believes.) The U. S. cavalry, for instance, wore the symbol of the cross swords which is an occult symbol for the War of Armageddon. For a reminder of the level of atrocity and demonic nature of the generals, I refer the reader to the classic films Paths of Glory and Breaker Morant, and to the “Dr. Who” features: War Games, Genesis of the Daleks, State of Decay, and Enlightenment. Many modern assassinations are committed at important sites on the Earth Grid, so that they constitute a ritual slaying (see “Jack the Ripper” crimes, as well as the execu- tions of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Lady Diana Spencer). Lady Spencer was murdered in ritual fashion, exactly on the same day that the “Ripper” claimed his first victim, August 31. This is also the day when the constellation of the “Vir- gin” (Virgo) descends below the horizon into the underworld. Virgo is connected with illus- trious females and mothers. The “Ripper Murders” were committed at the behest of the Masonic Lodges of England. Author Stephen Knight, who exposed the names behind it, as well as the reason for the atrocities, died two years after his book, The Brotherhood, came out. His death has never been satisfactorily explained. John F. Kennedy was also murdered at the junction of three roads, at the astrological position known as the thirteenth sign, Ophiuchus, which exists between Scorpio and Sagittarius . In ancient times, the hero who descended into the “Underworld” at this point was known as the “Traveler.” Suggestively, this was the code name for John F. Kennedy, as used by his secret service. (The secrets of the president's murder are detailed in Called to Serve, the biography of Lieutenant Colonel James “Bo” Gritz). Many serial killers murder between seven and thirteen victims before they are suddenly “caught.” The reader may stand aghast that such nefarious activities could indeed be sanctioned by those of Royal blood. But a review of history clearly demonstrates that the monar- chies of the world have little conscience when it comes to mass murder. Their actions, however, make sense if our theory is correct that the post-diluvian oligarchs have strong ties to the alien Nephilim and that they have through time suppressed, and even bred out, the human chromosomes in their DNA profiles. For the reader who cannot"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Their Satanic Majesty’s Request 96 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation comprehend the kind of mentality that would conspire to murder not only individuals but entire cultures, here are a few words to ponder: The state of monarchy is the most supreme thing upon earth, for kings are not only God's lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon God's throne, but even by God himself are called gods...and so their power after a certain relation compared to divine power...for if you will consider the attributes to God, you shall see how they agree in the person of a king...to dis- pute what God does is blasphemy...so it is sedition in subjects to dispute what a king may do in the height of his power. I would not have you meddle with such ancient rights of mine as I have received from my predecessors... (James I, King of Scotland and England) Historians prefer to disregard such language as mere hyperbole or rhetoric, the ravings of megalomaniacs. Clearly, however, in light of our present thesis, these sinister words connote so much more. The passage indicates that the “divine right” had been passed down from antique periods and the theme of bloodline is clearly implied. But human rather than divine politics are evidenced, for no god worthy of veneration could be the author and conveyor of such powers. Many kings claimed descent from the ancient bloodlines. Charlemagne, for instance, used the title “David” to indicate his descent from the Israelite King of Jerusalem. Kings wore crowns, and the word crown comes from Cronus (Kronos, Janus, Crom, Chaos, etc.,) which was the ancient name for the planet Saturn. Somehow, the planet Saturn and its symbolism became confused with that of Tiamat, which was thought to be the second sun that fell to Earth. Kings of the Earth were said to rule as Saturn, or for Saturn. The Hebrews identified Saturn with Lucifer or Satan, god of restriction, materialism, negativity, and chaos, who also fell from “heaven.” The Sumerians state that the first human kings on Earth were the offspring of Custodial rul- ers who mated with the human women. Those matings entitled the half-human offspring to become the early monarchs on Earth. (William Bramley, Gods of Eden )"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 97 CHAPTER 16 Serpents in the Streets Great capitol cities of the world have precise geometric shapes because of Sir John Dee's pact with the Macrobes. Since the entire human race was offered up in the pact, what better way than to have humans live right in the center of enormous satanic ritual precincts? We call these precincts “cities.” In the book, Secret Architecture of our Nation’s Capitol , researcher David Ovason gives information gleaned from the Library of Congress, from the vaults and archives of Washington D. C., and from the memoirs, letters, and writings of America’s Founding Fathers which reveal that cities and their design are part of an occult agenda instigated by Freemasons of the 33rd degree and beyond. Ovason, apparently, does not comprehend what the agenda is. He reveals that in Washington D. C. alone, however, there are 22 full zodiacs secreted into the architecture and layout. This is more than anywhere else in the world. He draws attention to the reasons why the U. S. Pentagon, the Oval Office, and the Washington Monument have the shapes they do. Have we ever wondered why the members of the military adorn themselves, their buildings, and their hellish machines with stars? Have we asked why it is that the U. S. Pentagon is that shape or why it is oriented due north towards one of the ancient pole stars, Thubin, the star of war and evil, previous to Mars? If one imagines the arms put back onto the perimeter of a geometrical pentagon, they will see it become a pentacle–a symbol, which though not nega- tive in itself, has long been associated with “Black Magic” and which is often utilized by members of Satanic cabals. As we mentioned before, all we know, or think we know about the theme of Satanism actually refers to the alien presence and influence on this planet, and to no other source. It has rarely been revealed that the Vatican (one of the most truly Satanic edifices in mankind’s history) has spent literally billions of dollars to give mankind a false notion of Magic and the Black Arts. Their efforts and expenditure go into the making and purveying of popular music and movies which are exploitative and gratuitous and which generate deviant messages about the nature of Satanism. The famous black and white classic horror movies ( Dracula , The Mummy , The Werewolf, and Invisible Man , etc.), the “B” movies of the 50s and 60s, and the"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Serpents in the Streets 98 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation “slasher” or “occult” movies ( The Exorcist , Friday 13 th , Halloween , Evil Dead , Poltergeist , The Shining , etc.,) of more recent times, are perfect examples of their artifice. Along with certain popular genres of music which have occult themes and imagery (which may appear anti-Chris- tian), these films and their creators are, in actual fact, surreptitiously funded by the Vatican (also by the Jesuits and the Illuminati) via the record companies, marketing agents, and publicity houses. There is a reason why the pop icon Madonna, for instance, has this moniker and why she constantly displays the cross or crucifix. It is why the imagery in her videos is of the type it is and why she is so personally wealthy. It has to do with whom she and her promoters serve. The same goes for the Rolling Stones (listen to Sympathy for the Devil, 200 Light Years from Home, Midnight Rambler, Paint It Black, Goat's Head Soup, Their Satanic Majesty's Request, etc.,) the Beatles, and the Grateful Dead. And these are but three examples of thousands. The public would be shocked to their core if they were to find out the facts about this particular study and about what has been infiltrated into their minds and the minds of their young. Here are some of the key passages from the David Ovason’s masterpiece, which bring out facts that have long been concealed from the public: The extraordinary truth is that the very existence of the Washington Monument is intimately linked with the Egyptian star, Sirius the Sihor, which the ancients represented in their sacred hieroglyphics as an obelisk as well as a star. How is it possible that this most important star of the ancient world should find itself, as it were, resurrected in the architecture of the United States. ...in the course of that day, when the cornerstone of the Washington Monument was laid, the Sun would have passed over Sirius. ...Computations clearly show that on the day the Declaration of Independence was agreed in Philadelphia, the Sun was on Sirius. The Mason who first signed the Declaration of Independence would have been aware of the particular significance of July 4 as a cosmic event. The day was the second in the so-called dog days...which begin on July 3. The dog days are so-called because they refer to the rising of the star Sirius. This emphasis on the star Sirius is singular since a name of the Monarch of Atlantis, Posei- don, comes from the syllable Po , meaning Sirius and Don meaning Lord. Even more sugges- tively, Poseidon was the god of earthquakes and was said to be the creator of men . Sirius also played a part in the Moon landing of Apollo 11. It appears that the “Eagle” landed when the light from this star was the brightest. The landing also took place in July, when Sir- ius is rising and visible from Earth. Ovason reveals that before the cameras filmed the"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 99 Serpents in the Streets official placing of the American flag, a Masonic ceremony took place, which was never tele- vised or revealed to the American “free” public. Buzz Aldrin produced a Masonic banner which was specially embroidered for the strange trip by the librarian of the Masonic House of the Temple in Washington D. C. The Egyptian hierogram for the star Sirius consists of three shapes: a five-pointed star, an oval, and an obelisk. Amazingly, this is just what we find in stone in Washington D.C. The entire city is dedicated astromantically to the star Sirius and its occult deities. Astrology is good enough for the ruling Plutocrats it seems. Pity that when the ordinary person seeks to use the divination arts for their own personal physical and spiritual empowerment, they are considered freaks and devil-worshippers. Millionaires do not use astrology, billionaires do. (J. P. Morgan) Ovason’s book continues: ...for within a year of Washington’s death, it was recognized that the great man could most fittingly be memorialized by means of a massive pyramid. The pyramid was already widely used as a symbol in Masonic Fraternities in Europe, and we should, therefore, not be surprised that it should have been proposed in the context of a national symbol guided by so many Freemasons. The chances of the correspondence being mere coincidence are so remote that we must assume that whoever was directing the planning of Washington D.C., not only had a consid- erable knowledge of astrology, but had a vested interest in emphasizing the role of...Virgo. The Constitution put before the people on September 19th 1787 in Virgo. Virgo is important for several reasons, one of them being that this is where the astrological “descendant” of the Earth is at this time. The numerology of the above date may interest researcher and author Richard Hoagland who has, among others, emphasized the signifi- cance of the harmonic and ratio 91.5. There may be no doubt altogether that astrology played an important role in the choice of the key monuments for the laying down of the federal city. Even so... we are... reduced to speculation as to which individual, or group of individuals, was behind this extraordinary undertaking. ...a survey of the foundation charts used in the...building of Washington D.C., reveals the importance of astrology, and, indeed, confirms beyond doubt that astrology played an important role in the early Masonic rites. The rationale of astrology was rarely discussed"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Serpents in the Streets 100 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation openly, even in Masonic documents. Knowledge of the stars--insofar as they were under- stood in Masonic circles--was preserved as secrets best left to those with specialist knowl- edge of such things. The practice of assigning places to the rule of specific zodiacal signs (and thus, in medieval times, to spiritual beings) is very ancient and has been extended into modern times. Since the discovery of America ...we are able to trace most of the sources for the zodiacal rulerships ascribed to the cities of the United States. Perhaps it is sufficient that we recognize as true the medieval arcane notion that such beings could be invited to participate in the life of a city, by means of the spiritual art of astrology. Ovason then goes on to give one reason why the city was constructed according to such specific designs and dates. He speaks of the presence or existence of angelic beings, or overlords, who are being invoked to literally take part in the terrestrial oper- ations of mankind. The Masonic Fathers and builders of the city referred to these enti- ties by their Latin term, “Cosmocrates”: The leader of these mighty beings was due to take over the direction of Western civilization in 1881 caused considerable excitement in the esoteric circles of Washington D.C., and the occult world in general. The very word Capitol derives from Caput Draconis, meaning the head and tail of the Dragon. We feel that Ovason's book and his findings clearly proves the existence of the Mac- robes. In the past, when one of the “Serpent Masters” or one of the “Sons of the Serpents” ended their long life, their confederates would generally commemorate their lives in stone by building a monument which encapsulated through its design and geometry the existence of the deceased alien or semi-alien being. We know these monuments today, for they are the cyclopean ruins that exist in almost every country of the world. Others, like the complex at Giza in Egypt, were constructed afterward. Such edifices are not tombs but cenotaphs. These monuments of commemoration are not to be confused with the circles, calendars, and earthworks that were made for utilitarian purposes."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 101 Serpents in the Streets Those who have been and who continue to desecrate these monuments do so to appropriate the power of the artifacts therein and to change the frequencies that they generate for the good of the planet. The very Earth itself is adversely affected with each of these invasions. Places where the body of one of the original “Serpent Masters” was interred would become geomantically corrupted and exude negative energy, becoming regions of strife and turmoil in the world. Conversely, the places where one of the Lemurian Magi are interred give off quite the opposite energy. These are places of unbelievable power and majesty. The study of these places and of geomancy, in general, is beyond the scope of this presentation (see the works of David Hatcher Childress)."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Serpents in the Streets 102 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 103 CHAPTER 17 From the Sword to the Syringe Just look at us. Everything is backwards. Everything is upside-down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information, and religion destroys spirituality. (Michael Ellner) There are many other acts, perhaps not so overtly or initially violent, that are still part of the blood ritual inspired by the Macrobes. One manner of keeping the masses in check, as well as helping them lose their senses and commit slow suicide, concerns the purveyance of alcoholic beverages called “spirits” in taverns and inns. This custom was started under the tax exempt Knights Templars who opened most of the inns in England. These dens all have patently occult names (like Green Dragon, or Black Horse, Raven's Head, Red Lion, Plough and Stars, Rose and Crown, etc.). They also commonly bore the name “Arms” to commemorate that they were established by the military orders. They were also known down through history as venues for all kinds of revolutionaries and malcontents (see Daphne Du Maurier’s Jamaica Inn ). And the cult of hallucinogens has been growing stronger for generations. They still provide one of the best means of creating family dislocation and personal existential malaise. They grope in the dark without light, and him maketh them to stagger like a drunken man (Job 12:25) The youth are especially vulnerable. Drugs and perversions of every kind, are made attractive and chic. The hard drugs that are taken by teens are also made available by the elites and the modern Dionysian Cults they fund. Every decade they provide some other bromide or toy to distract and befuddle the masses. And the masters have even created designer diseases to thin the herd.

I have seen 200 cases of cancer, and I never saw a case of cancer in an unvaccinated per- son...

Dr. Gottlieb was named to head the National Cancer Institute. And the genocide is certainly not confined to the human domain: Exactly a hundred years ago, the rate of dying out of biological species began to increase exponentially; as a result of which in the mid-1980’s a species vanished every day and by the year 2000, this will have increased to a species every hour. We have monopolized the earth for our species alone.

The self-named “Super Powers” commissioned the suggestively named “Star Wars.” The very moniker is loaded with significance. We had also better begin asking if there is something suggestive in the terms “atomic” and “nuclear” as applied to war. There is certainly a nuclear and atomic war, but not on the level that most peo- ple think. These words refer to the inner self, the biology of humans. While we are watching the skies and looking for the “reds under the beds” a real cold war is being perpetrated much closer to home. The ultimate ignorance is not to see this.

It is a problem for us today and unless we accept its origin it will persist as a problem for future genera- tions. We were forewarned by our ancestors of the times we now find ourselves in. From at least three millennia ago, we have these words from the high priestesses of the Celtic peoples: Then she added a prophecy in which she foretold the approaching end of the divine age and the coming of a new one, in which the summers would be flowerless, the cows milkless and women shameless and men strengthless, in which there would be trees without fruit and seas without fish, when old men would give false judgments and legislators would make unjust laws, when warriors would betray one another and men would be thieves and there would be no more virtue in the world.

Moreover, the dark ones are as mystified and irritated with their exalted qualities as we are with our negative qualities.

It is obligatory for them to tell us in one way or another what their machinations and designs are, and what is happening or ever going to happen to their prospective victims.

The space program, the “Silicon Revolution,” all the genetic, pharmaceutical, and military budgets and researches are convened with this objective in mind. Today’s “Silicon Revolution” is the culmination of operations set into motion in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It has been long awaited. Its front- men are made fabulously wealthy (though they personally own little of their own com- panies), and all doors are open to them. No one questions why they use the logos that they do ( Apple Macintosh, Sun, NEC, Gateway , etc,). Few question the connection of these frontmen to powerful European financiers or question why they receive presti- gious honors from royals. The word PENTIUM is a perfect example of what we are saying. Like most corporate logos and words, it does not mean anything in English. This is because it is designed to work as an icon, a hierogram, mantically on a subliminal level of mentation. But all is revealed if we merely add the prefix ‘ ser’ to the beginning of the word. One may also take note of the “Intel” logo which has a distinct serpentine motif. But these are only two examples of thou- sands. The space program and all its attendant fields exist because the secret Brotherhood cannot of their own volition leave the planet. The supra-celestial forces have incarcer- ated them here permanently. The means of their entrapment is the Moon’s orbit, which is a barrier of etheric energy, the nature of which remains largely unknown to them and us. This orbit encloses the Earth, and this is the reason why there have been no manned excursions beyond the Moon. They can go to the Moon but cannot venture beyond, although machines can. This has caused them enormous frustration, and they will not rest until they find the means to break through this energy field. The Moon’s orbit has long been associated with power, protection, and ethereal energies. The Chinese refer to its encirclement as the coils of the “Great Dragon,” and this is what their dragon dances are partly about. Even in modern astrology and astronomy, we have the Moon’s “nodes,” also known as the “circling dragon.” The dragon symbol is one of the supreme archetypes; one should endeavor to make a com- plete study of all its permutations.

It must soon be realized that these seemingly quaint images and motifs have a deep interstellar implication. This is why we see so many planetary and sabean symbols in occult books, and why occult symbols turn up on the institutes of government, security services, and subver- sive fraternities. The Nephilim who fell to Earth from the netherworld are trying desperately to regain their freedom. They have been chained in the pit (Earth), but are convinced that there is a way out of their terrestrial prison. This is why the space program exists, and why there is exorbitant and frenzied expenditure in satellites and the exploration of outer space. Look at the names given to many of the space programs and modules: Gemini, Mercury, Capricorn, Apollo, Seti, NASA, Voyager, Columbia, Challenger , etc. Notice also the names of the research and invention laboratories that produce the technology. So many bear names that come out of the ancient world or are cryptically occult (see Phoenix, Microsoft, Loral, Altera, Lam, Siliconix, Teknekron, NEC, Apple, Oracle, 3M, Intel, NASA, Sun, Double Tree, Sunaco, Texaco, and so on). The aliens on this planet are also attempting to clone or replicate the human form arti- ficially. Their original form, being humanoid, cannot pass the field that was estab- lished around the Earth. But if they can clone or cybernetically change their forms, it may help their designs. This is why virtual reality, cybernetics, cloning, and nanotech- nology are in vogue today. The satellites also play a crucial role. When a burglar attempts to disarm an alarm system, he usually inserts a “dummy wire” to bypass the main coil and to silently break the circuit. So, the satellites with their on-board laser weapons, ELF, and microwaves (see HAARP) are the tools these criminals use in their attempt to open a gate in the Moon’s orbit."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"From the Sword to the Syringe 110 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation We see the motif in several movies (see Stargate, Moonraker, City of Evil, War of the Worlds, Quatermass, Nosferatu-the Vampyre, The Devil Rides Out, Life-Force, Things to Come , Koyannisqatsi, etc.), certain artwork (see Hypnosis, Rodney Matthews, Roger Dean, and H. R. Giger) and other works of science-fiction. Some of the movies with themes per- taining to our thesis are commissioned by the Hidden Masters to provide mankind “updates” on the progress they are making. Of course, the information registers on a subliminal level only, but we are still being told, which is the main point. It is in accordance with the pact between the forces of “light” and “darkness.” The Atlanteans’ bloodkin do not like the human traits within themselves, nor do they relish human beings. They have always preferred to be served by robots of a mechani- cal or cybernetic kind and would have done away with humans long ago had that been feasible. They keep us alive because the Macrobes need their sacrifices, and also because they think that they can have the “robots” they prefer by dumbing down humans to the level of the automaton. In this way, they have the best servants. And this is exactly what has been happening since the sixteenth century, or the time when the “Regents of Darkness” discovered that they may have to remain here on Earth perma- nently. Even though they do not slacken in their work to vacate, they have in the back of their minds the thought that they may be interned here permanently. And this is what is keeping humans alive, even if it is in the state we now find ourselves, controlled, cir- cumvented at every turn, diseased and barely able to survive, with degradation and criminality all around. We are to be kept alive but are no longer allowed to move toward our spiritual destinies like before, or to be as naturally creative and intelligent as before, or to in any way empower ourselves to the level we knew when on Lemuria or later Lemurian influenced colonies. We are not permitted to live with our respective races, are not permitted to live close to nature, not able to travel relatively freely to all parts of the globe, and not permitted to correctly administer to our own physical health. We are given “Liberty” which is not the same thing as “Freedom,” as research- ers like Jordan Maxwell have pointed out. They have begrudgingly and only relatively recently extended the privilege of education and the vote, only so that we can be useful, productive, monitored, and controlled. The past record of man is burdened with accounts of assassinations, secret combines, palace plots and betrayals in war. But in spite of this clear record, an amazing number of people have begun to scoff at the possibility of conspiracy at work today. They dismiss such an idea merely as a Conspiratorial View. (G.

(Sidney Webb , founder of the Fabian Society) The so-called Left-Right political spectrum is our creation. In fact, it accurately reflects our careful, artificial polarization of the population on phoney issues that prevents the issue of our power from arising in their minds. (The Occult Technocracy of Power) The “opposition” party is called the “opposition” by its creators, namely, the “opposition.” (Author) Those of us who have great difficulty accepting that there is a “Big Brother” exercis- ing unlimited control, do so because they have forgotten the manner in which Pluto- crats exercise control and the comparative freedom and wealth they have enjoyed for millennia. Naturally, when one looks at the complexity of urban life, it does seem improbable that some “secret society” can just “move in,” as it were and take over. But we forget that the very cities and nations are their creations, that ordinary man was impinged upon by crown and gown for centuries, living in villages from which he never strayed, except in the service of his feudal lords. The life of rural and agricul- tural man was certainly not his own. We forget that due to the suppression of historical data the pedestal of the present centuries does not provide a very good vantage point for reviewing the past. Given the structure of pre-Industrial society, nothing could have been easier for the Masters than the total takeover of empires, resources, and minds. Just because one does not have an actual “mark” on their forehead or a physical gun to their head does not mean they are free. Today, we are free only to do what we are told. We need to be reminded that there are two main methods of affecting changes and imposing control on any animal. The first method is by direct training. This is accomplished by schools, universities, recalcitrant parents, and peer groups."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Lambs to the Slaughter 114 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation A general state education is a mere contrivance for molding people to be exactly like one another; and as the mold in which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant power in the government...it establishes a despotism over the mind... (John Stuart Mill) The second method is by the instigation of changes to the environment of the animal. Though these are almost always beyond the awareness of the creature, they are extremely impactive. By exercising both methods, the Hidden Masters accomplish all the behavioral changes they require. The results are apparent for anyone who cares to see them. To repress rebellion is to maintain the status quo, a condition which binds the mortal crea- ture in a state of intellectual or physical slavery. But it is impossible to chain man merely by slaving his body; the mind also must be held, and to accomplish this, fear is the accepted weapon. The common man must fear life, fear death, fear God, fear the Devil, and fear most the overlords, the keepers of his destiny. (Manly Palmer Hall) I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens who, reading newspapers, live and die in the belief that they have known something of what has been passing in their times. (Thomas Jefferson) We are powerfully imprisoned in these Dark Ages simply in terms in which we have been conditioned to think. (Buckminster Fuller) And again, from the horse’s mouth: The older dictators fell because they could never supply their subjects with enough bread, enough circuses, enough miracles, and mysteries. Under a scientific dictatorship, education will really work...most men and women will grow up to love their servitude and will never dream of revolution. There seems to be no good reason why a thoroughly scientific dictator- ship should ever be overthrown. (Aldous Huxley , Brave New World Revisited ) Investigations into the beginnings of religion have accumulated steadily throughout the past half-century. It is only by great efforts of censorship, by sectarian education of an elabo- rately protected sort, and the like, that ignorance about them is maintained. (H. G. Wells , The Fate of Homo Sapiens ). The conscious and intelligent manipulation of organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in a democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mecha- nism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power in the our country ...

We shall have World Government whether or not you like it, by conquest or consent. (James Warburg , before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) . The great Irish scholar and Christian thinker C. S. Lewis wrote in the 1940’s about these aliens and their internment on our Earth, which he referred to as the “Silent Planet.” In a similar vein as his colleague J. R. R. Tolkien, he attempted to create fic- tional works that would disseminate the truth that he had uncovered while reading the great untranslated Medieval and Anglo-Saxon tomes, deep in the vaults of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Not one-tenth of the books that have been penned are available in the public domain. Throughout time, there have been many who have written on the matters here discussed. Such writings are eventually ridiculed and/or sequestered. (See Five Million Years to Earth and The Name of the Rose. ) Until now, none of the plans for escaping the “Silent Planet” have worked, with both sides being in complete collusion. Billions, however, continue to be spent, Cold War or no Cold War. The Cold War was the cover for these machinations in outer space, both sides being in complete collusion. What better way to keep the masses oblivious to the real reasons for this expenditure than to create the dialectic of two antithetical factions and the threat of nuclear assault from the air? Anyone who has done a bit of homework knows that the Soviets procured their weaponry and funding from the United States. They were even allowed into space first to incite the competition fever. The conflict was called “Cold War” because it was known that it would never come to a head and that it would never “heat up,” being a carefully conceived artifice from the outset. Every resource on this planet is expendable because the controllers have a change of address in mind. Mankind is an endangered species, but is, unfortunately, not intelli- gent or informed enough to realize that it is on the brink of forced extinction. Evil is in evidence everywhere, yet few there are who take proactive measures against it, pro- grammed as we have been to think that evil is an innate part of human nature. For gen- erations, man has believed nature capable of creating a species with such existential dysfunction that its own inviolate order would be undermined. As detailed earlier, it is"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Lambs to the Slaughter 116 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation the psychic acceptance of this insinuated fallacy that literally incites our individual and collective deviancies."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 117 CHAPTER 19 Doodles in the Crops There is also good reason to believe that the phenomenon known as the “crop-circles” have been created via satellites by the microwave technology known as HAARP. These circles and formations are not caused by doodling extraterrestrials with nothing better to do. The technology to create even the most complex crop mandalas is cer- tainly in existence, regardless of the denials of scientists and science buffs. Terrence Meaden and the main “experts” that originally specialized in the circles are known to have worked for top government think-tanks and laboratories. (The same goes for other disinformationalists, such as Carl Sagan, Arthur C. Clarke, Timothy Leary, and others.) Their information regarding the phenomena is inaccurate and misleading, designed to lead one away from the truth. It has become so easy for these types and their superiors to dupe us like this. After centuries of spiritual impoverishment, of mental and physical deprivation, we are in great need of knowledge and empower- ment. We will, therefore, flippantly entertain any and all ideas that are manufactured for us to consume, especially ideas that occasion vicarious fulfillment of deep arche- typal or instinctual desires. The progeny of Atlantis are expert in the subjects of human biology and psychology, and they know all about the operations and complexion of the human libido. The myriad sensationalistic distractions they produce are adroitly crafted to poison the psyche and lead to existential anomalies. One can, however, tell that there is something malign behind these façades when subtle fallacies are intro- duced regarding divinity and spirit. Some of these insinuations are so subtle that they persist into accepted traditions and enter into the collective consciousness. Originally, there was a phenomenon of crop circles, but they are different from the ones that have been appearing and captivating the masses of late. The hole in the ozone layer was not only caused by CFCs, but by microwave technology from HAARP. Microwaves were beamed onto the Stargate to break it, but instead they super- heated the atmosphere causing permanent damage to the ozone layer. HAARP and micro-"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Doodles in the Crops 118 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation waves are also behind the “Greenhouse Effect.” CFCs are an environmental problem. The CFC molecule is three times heavier than the air molecules. It sinks rather than rises. The CFCs which are in the stratosphere got there because of the atomic blasts of tested weaponry and from the launching of rockets, such as the space Shuttle “Atlantis.” When these bombs detonate and when these supersonic vessels blast off, they carry a vast amount of dust up with them. And with the dust, goes the CFCs. The very velocity and spiraling motion of the rockets and of the satellites, causes disturbance in the planet’s atmosphere by generating large amounts of positive ionization. Even from the earliest of times the Atlanteans and their progeny have long been involved in manipulating weather. Again, it is in myths that we find most of the references (which have been not taken seriously). In the post-diluvian epoch, our planet has been visited by many plagues and meteorological catastrophes, not all of which have had natural causes. In 535 A.D. for instance, there was such an event which impacted the entire world causing people to expect the end of the world. John Ephesus (in the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian ) recorded the event and wrote: There was a sign from the sun, the like of which had never been seen and reported before. The sun became dark and its darkness lasted for eighteen months...Everyone declared that the sun would never recover its full light again. For more on this kind of phenomena and the causes, see Gods of Eden by William Bramley. HAARP is used for other purposes also. The Stargate prevents the humanoid descen- dants of the Nephilim from leaving this planet, but does not prevent other beings from entering the atmosphere of Earth. Most “sightings” today are of the Nephilim crafts which can move freely through the atmosphere but cannot penetrate the barrier. These other visitors (whose ships are occasionally seen also) are generally beings of a high consciousness who are allowed through the Stargate. In their desperation, the “Bent Ones” have often sought to trap these incoming ships, in hope of procuring them to make an escape. To trap these other crafts, they use low and high frequency waves and radiotronic weaponry. These are housed and manipulated from the Earth, from below the surface of the Earth, and also, more recently, from orbiting satellites. And certain visiting beings have indeed suffered the fate of having their ships mysteriously veering out of control and falling to the ground. The occupants are then summarily abducted and incarcerated in the many underground stations run by the military and are often tortured to reveal their secrets. (See Stranger from Venus and The Day the Earth Stood Still )."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 119 Doodles in the Crops T he “greys” that are common in eyewitness reports are not the actual aliens, but are semi- organic automatons created by their masters who control them via advanced forms of remote control. This is betrayed by eyewitness reports of their strange movements and stoic attitudes. There are several theories that can account for the designs in the wheat which, in all likelihood, will never be covered in the mainstream media. The Earth has its own geo- mantic grid, its own biospheric energy which is not conducive to the alien presence on this planet. For this reason, forests have been eradicated, oceans polluted, and the air filled with dioxides and monoxides. In the same way as we would feel ill at ease in a prison cell, those with a strong alien biology are negatively affected by the ultraviolet rays, the Schumann waves, and other cosmic and geospheric forces surrounding them. The very things we find indescribably pleasing about the planet, they experience as discordant. This planet’s size is also not the same as what they were used to, and things became worse after the war that they instigated against their “First Born.” Conse- quently, they engage in certain bizarre undertakings to counteract this discomfort, but which are outside the scope of this book (like physically moving the entire planet to a new location in the solar system). The progeny of the Nephilim, like their alien fathers, have been making use of deep under- ground caverns, some of which are hundreds of miles wide. They do not find it suitable on the surface of the planet and prefer the underworld. This is one reason why their monopolies are so adroit at leveling the forests and polluting the atmosphere. It is the ordinary Adamic human that suffers, while they remain impervious in their underground cities. The crop-circles are designed by them via satellite for some of the same reasons. They cause changes in the frequency of the Earth-Grid in favor of the alien presence. And the humans that gather on site and who watch on TV are part of the ritual. The energy of curiosity that they expend is very valuable. For any event that utilizes mass con- sciousness serves the aliens and the Macrobes, whether that event appears to be sacred or not. The average human’s entire psychology changes when viewing anything like an eclipse, a comet, a solstice, or other anomalies. This release of collective telekinetic psychic force is really like an emission of power from a giant organic battery or com- puter. The “Serpent Masters” are expert in creating theaters for just these kinds of events. They are the gladiatorial arenas of the modern age. (See also Quatermass - The Conclusion , Five Million Years to Earth, and Lifeforce ). The crop circles do indeed feature “sacred symbolism,” but that does not of itself mean that they are formed by sacred persons or entities. The circle is sacred but is used in"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Doodles in the Crops 120 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation any number of common and banal ways. Moreover, sacred symbolism has been con- sistently used by the creators of cities, the builders of universities, and in cathedrals and churches for centuries, yet these are some of the most adroitly exploitative edi- fices of the alien bloodkin. Unfortunately, just because a symbol is known to have magical properties does not mean that only one side can use it. It is also somewhat simplistic and irrational to expect the aliens to use patently negative symbolism that would openly betray their presence and agenda. Let it be known once and for all that when real spiritual forces are operating in the human domain, there is never any question of mystery or befuddlement. There is only direct, austere confrontation, administered understanding and truth– no doubts, no speculations, no theories. Divine powers are not in the habit of condoning or instigat- ing wasteful expenditures of mental or emotional energy. If there is even the slightest question as to the nature, origin, or veracity of any phenomena, then that is already perfect proof that true universal forces were not involved. One need look only to the human domain."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 121 CHAPTER 20 What Planet Are You From? These devious aliens have inseminated some pernicious philosophies within the neo- theological and so called “New Age” movements. We find, in many associated with this milieu, a belief that humans themselves are actually visitors to the Earth from other galaxies and planets. Now, as previously said herein, there are indeed beings here from other planets. But what are we to make of this growing group and its convic- tions that they are all from outer space? Are we to join with them and look to the heav- ens for our own origins? Is our original home out there somewhere? And is there enlightenment for humankind in this conjecture? Indeed, it seems, in these coteries, as though few wish to belong to this Earth. Some “New Agers” and many of the intelli- gentsia are purveying the idea that mankind may have descended here from Sirius, the Pleiades, or elsewhere. This idea is especially attractive to those who have problems fitting in here on planet Earth. One finds relief and hope in stargazing, peering into the nether and aspiring, if the chance arose to shake off the dust of this habitat and ascend out into the abyss in a search for their “true home.” This desire is understandable given the relative horror of life here and predictable given the number of films produced that feature and promote this theme. But is there anything rational in it? Now, it so happens that the pages of the ancient scriptures and myths also mention the same aspiration, only it is not that of the human race, of any patriarch, or prophet. In the Bible and the ancient myths, one hears of Lucifer, or the dark angels, despising their sojourn in Paradise or Eden and consumed with mania and false aspiration, even- tually leaving or being cast out of their home into the abyss and banished as defilers and ingrates. Perhaps the reality is that today the ones who are spiritually despondent and filled with the sense of futility are actually the true children of the Earth, while those who appear content and adjusted are from “out there,” transplanted centuries ago to exploit the Earth and its indigenous inhabitants. These “adjusted” ones must be"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"What Planet Are You From? 122 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation those who align with their alien DNA and who police those who have a problem with the present conditions of the planet. It is the “Fallen Ones” who seek to encourage their human slaves to think that they too have descended from the depths of space. The fact is, as the Pagans have understood, that this Earth is our one and only Garden of Eden. How is it that from this paradise one can look out to the nether and fantasize that “home” is somewhere out there? Only Satan and his hordes and those they have deluded the world would do such a bizarre thing. These ancient stories are extremely pertinent to the condition of the present. Genesis means the “Genes of Isis.” Isis is the Queen of the Earth, and we of the Earth are Her offspring, suffering from amnesia about our Earth-connection, convinced that the black void above is the real home we have lost. So our perception is in total reverse. Nothing measures the loss of reason more than the pervasiveness of this out- landish, incongruent notion. It is consistent only with the duped and controlled masses who are now psychologically identifying with the desires of the alien oppressors, instead of affirming with pride and love that they are children of this perfumed garden Earth. No doubt there are millions here who have come from another galaxy or dimension and they are being looked after. And perhaps in the very depths of our origins, there is indeed a connection to some outer worlds, but this is not the same as the present wholly perfidious and reprehensible fixations, carefully crafted and implanted, that all discontents have their ancestry in the stars. Another dimension to this mania concerns the “threat” from outer space. Science-fiction movies often have the destruction of the Earth or some impending threat from “out there” as a theme. Is it unreasonable to see something more than creative license in this? Even presidents get in on the game: If suddenly there was a threat to this world from some other species from another planet, we'd forget all the little local differences that we have between our two countries and we would find out once and for all that we really are all human beings on this Earth.

The “Serpent Masters,” who visited our planet ages ago, arrived and took over without permission. They literally invaded our sovereign planet and interfered with the destiny and evolution of the native inhabitants while possessing no “legal” status, so to speak. Like many terrestrial illegal immigrants, these aliens had, and their progeny have, no love for the world they occupy. Their treatment of the Earth tells us as much. Their plundering of nations, their decimation of indigenous peoples and their violation of nature, should be taken as ample evidence for their origins. The human victims of Earth must, therefore, remedy the injustices perpetrated against them by assertively taking back their power and exercising their birthrights as “Earth Citizens.” Men and women, as their own “Immigration Officers,” so to speak, have the right to bring to justice, and even expunge, those who have violated universal law, human sovereignty, and who have themselves no rights, status, jurisdiction or authority. The so-called Controllers, or Hidden Masters, the Secret Chiefs, those descendants of the alien con- querors, whose influence and machinations have wrought untold horrors on Earth have absolutely no legal right to hold their offices, to pass their laws, to exercise command, to create wars, or to slaughter, impoverish, enslave, divide, and mislead mankind. They have no right to interfere, in any way, with the destiny and evolution of the Earth. Since they have appropriated these rights, they must be held totally accountable. Moreover, the Nephilim have not, as some scholars ludicrously assert, left this planet in the days of old. Therefore, they are not about to return to save us all from ourselves. They have never been away and they have brought the conditions that plague us. The Earth is considered nothing more than a prison to them, a place of internment which is almost unendurable. The destruction they engage in is done to satisfy their vast crav- ings and mollify their “Dark Archons” from other dimensions. The decadence, debauchery, and nihilism infecting everything today is sadly a replay of the past. Due to adroit historical tampering and befuddling by ecclesiastical clerics and priests, we have been prevented from either understanding or heeding the Prophets of old: He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straighteneth them again.

Some question why things are so bad, why the “good” seem so helpless and why they seem to end in early graves? The answer to this and to our overall predicament can be provided by anyone conversant with the principles of the game of chess. A chess mas- ter will give his student audience four pieces of advice from which we can learn. He will say that the first thing that is needed is a sense of patience. He will say next that a sense of timing is essential. Then comes one’s knowledge of the opponent, and finally, the clincher, the willingness to make any and all sacrifices to win. Now, can we see why we have the problems we do? The good have no patience, no sense of timing, zero knowledge of the opponent, and because of their inherent morality, are not able to make the necessary sacrifices. Compare this to the enemy.

These aliens have no love for us, no care for their host planet, and will in all likelihood incinerate the entire place and all of humanity, by way of HAARP micro- wave technology now mounted on satellites. They may also use chemical weapons which will leave not a person or creature standing. With all the efforts into remote viewing, nanotechnology, virtual reality, subatomic manipulation, microwaves, sili- con, genetic foods, cloning, chemical and germ warfare, cybernetics, vaccines, designer diseases, and the worldwide web, a bleak picture presents itself. Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men. (Martin Luther King, Jr.) ...The combined military expenditures of all the world’s governments in 1987 were so large that all of the social programs of the United Nations could be financed for three hundred years by this expenditure. (William H. Koettke , The Final Empire ) The benefit to ordinary man of all this expenditure and industry is virtually non-exis- tent except on the usual utilitarian level.

All that is good has been and still is being system- atically removed from our inner and outer environments. For just as a virus penetrates the living cell, so have these alien beings, penetrated our planet long ago. It may be a short time before we, the host, are utterly destroyed and before those, who cause our sorry end, spread their wings and rise heavenward once again. We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. (Ephesians 6:12)"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 129 CHAPTER 22 Epilogue: Time to Change the Road You’re On Those who fear to face Reality, can never hope to change Reality. (Michael Tsarion) Now that we have an explanation of what has happened to the Earth and its inhabit- ants, we cannot but seek to find the final remedy. But the time may be shorter for this than we imagine. The ancient Mayan calendar ended at the year 2012 and some schol- ars have forecasted this date as the end of the world. Indeed, the way things are going, it could be. But more likely, it will be the world as we have known it that comes to an end. This author believes that there are four possible outcomes to the predicaments of the Earth and to the conflict between the alien and human DNA within. The nature of each outcome depends on their all-important intermediate stages and what transpires therein. Therefore, what the adversaries are doing presently impacts the events of 2012. The possible outcomes foreseen by this writer in his present state of awareness are: • The first outcome is that the progeny of the Atlanteans succeed in regaining all their technological hardware, especially that necessary for space travel. They manage to crack the code and break- through the Stargate and prepare for departure. In so doing, they come out into the open more than ever, startling the human race who cannot comprehend what is happening. When they are out of range, they destroy the planet and all that lives on it. (The reader is referred to Dr. Who and the Pyr- amids of Mars , Koyaanisqatsi, and Moonraker ). This is the “burn and rise no more” outcome. 1 1 ”Burn and rise no more” - from the “Motorhead” song, March or Die , on the theme of mankind's future. Author Lemmy Kilmister."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Epilogue: Time to Change the Road You’re On 130 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation • The second outcome is that the “Dark Archons” realize, once and for all, that they cannot leave this planet, that no matter what they do they are forever “chained to the pit.” In this case, they begin to rule the world with unmitigated tyranny, relentlessly and openly. The human race loses whatever privileges it had while its utility was beneficial. Now they are deprived and slaughtered and turn even upon themselves. Debauchery is everywhere and the planet is handed over to the perverse sci- ons of the sorcerers of Atlantis. We sink into chaos of unimaginable proportions, with all the repressed, dark content of consciousness in full view and without restraints of inner or outer authority. This is the “Bridges to Babylon” outcome. 2 • The third outcome is that the “good” under the weight of the yoke finally rise against their oppres- sors, actively preventing them from ever leaving and taking their evil elsewhere. To do this, we destroy (sacrifice) ourselves, taking them with us. (The reader is referred to the movies: The Wild Bunch, The Magnificent Seven, and Terminator II ). This is the “...start the fuse Tector” outcome. 3 • The fourth outcome is that mankind finally discovers the correct means to the end and vanquishes its enemy, with no excessive loss of life or home-world. Mankind will prove itself its own defender and redeemer. We will eradicate the enemy externally and finally resolve the question of evil on the microcosmic level. The beasts will be slain, the maidens rescued, the planet saved, and the ending happy. This is the true “Empire Strikes Back” outcome. 4 You may notice something is missing from these scenarios. There is no mention of anyone or anything else coming to our rescue. There is no mention of the conventional avengers and redeemers: gods, greys, Christs, angels, or Pleiadeans. There is no “Flash Gordon” on his way. We can accept God becoming Man to save Man, but not Man becoming God to save himself. (Vernon Howard) 2 “Bridges to Babylon,” from the album by the Rolling Stones, one of the bands funded by the present, but ancient, powerful psychedelic Cult of Dionysus. 3 “Start the fuse Tector,” from Sam Peckinpah's classic western, The Wild Bunch, which shows exactly how to fight fire with fire. 4 “The Empire Strikes Back,” from the film of the same name by George Lucas. Lucas, founder of Industrial Light and Magic, is one of the bloodkin to the Atlantean Serpents, as he never ceases intimating in his films. His mov- ies are modernizations, and even corruptions of, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings ."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 131 Epilogue: Time to Change the Road You’re On Naturally, there is nothing attractive or advantageous about outcomes one, two, or three. The third outcome certainly involves heroics, which would have impressed Sam Peckinpah but would mean that the planet Earth would finally be turned into a giant revolving headstone. There is a precedent for this kind of denouement in the records of old, for such an event almost took place in pre-diluvian times (see The Silver Arm by Jim Fitzpatrick). The second outcome is what many present-day creative savants fore- see happening. Musicians and filmmakers continue to warn the human race of the con- sequences of the “return of the repressed” within us. (See Bladerunner, Highlander, Outlander, Mad Max , Star Wars, Star Trek VI, and Dr. Who) . The first outcome is looking more likely at this point, considering the limited time between now and 2012. The fourth outcome is also possible despite the odds. It is obviously the best for humankind and the planet. But how are we to get to that stage? What kind of remedy is relatively non-violent and attractive to all peoples from any culture and guaranteed to be 100 percent successful? How can we get back to lives of harmony on a beautiful, vital, planet, the way it was prior to the visitation of the Nephilim? This is the dream of so many on our world. Can it be achieved physically or will it remain a dream within a dream? If this question was in the minds of all people today there would be progress instead of regress. The question of evil, addressed earlier, should be on the minds of every single living person. Unfortunately, most individuals are in a semi-comatose delirium when it comes to this, which is why civilizations have been in retrograde. There are, however, certain prerequisites to the fourth outcome. To avail it, it is imper- ative that during each intermediate stage almost all the “good people” need to be pro- actively participating in unison and solidarity, leaving aside their segregating philosophies and agendas. But even before reaching this seemingly impossible state, something else of great importance concerning the nature and machinations of the children of the Nephilim, the state of our world, and our minds needs to be addressed. Light never battles darkness, so when you see a fight it is always between two dark forces. (Vernon Howard)"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Epilogue: Time to Change the Road You’re On 132 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Despite the evidence, people still find the story of the Nephilim and the hidden histo- ries of our planet hard to accept, and futility is the general reaction, because the so- called “good” have rarely accessed the strength implicit in the word. Nor have they been operating according to their own rules of engagement. The adversary has dictated the game plan almost from the outset, giving themselves a headstart toward the real- ization of their goals, by insinuating, with consummate artifice, a fallacy in the minds of the good about the very nature and operation of evil. Questioning what this fallacy is, how it works, and what to do about it, is crucial to our personal and collective re- empowerment and to the attainment of the fourth outcome . The Bible gives us the advice “know thine enemy.” It would have been so much better for humanity and the planet, if we did. Those who align with “good” have been com- pelled to misidentify the enemy, their true nature and agendas, and to waste physical, emotional, mental resources and energy sparring with evil in a variety of ways, most of which are not only counterproductive but auto-destructive. He who fights too long against dragons, becomes a dragon himself. (Fredrick Nietzsche) Most people reluctantly accept that evil is operative in the world for the simple reason that no one can live and not know this. Some cling to the belief of a disincarnate adversary somewhere up in the clouds or down in hell. Some get to the point of identi- fying the adversary as more corporeal. When one becomes aware of the level of cor- ruption around them and successfully deduces its source, phrases like “our hidden masters are evil” become vogue. Actually, this tells us next to nothing for we have lit- tle concept of what evil really is, or how it operates, in the context we are addressing. Evil is, to us, the bad things which happen to good people. If such is caused by malign personages, then they must be resisted, they must be brought to judgment. All our energies must be spent finding rectification of the wrongs they perpetrate. This is generally what post-diluvian human beings have been thinking and doing. When we see the positive results of our commitment, we are excessively jubilant and our conviction is reinforced. When our efforts suffer setbacks, we become fatalistic and look to our own ranks resolving to do better next time. The attitude and energy we expend is, we believe, the reciprocal of what we are receiving from the other side. We imagine the combat to be a ferocious “tug-of-war” with victory going to the team with the strongest muscle, resistance, and adrenaline. But yet, for all this, pessimism grows."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 133 Epilogue: Time to Change the Road You’re On The evil that plagues us preys and intensifies, and we eventually come to face the fact that something is seriously wrong with our world, with the environment, and with our children. For all the resolutions and heroics, existentially, life becomes steadily more unbearable. We cannot understand why the net result of all the positive actions of good people add up to so little. As time goes by, we even lose the energy to find out why we are so jaded. Our best efforts consist of turning over and going to sleep and letting someone else take care of it. If you think of yourselves as helpless and ineffectual, it is certain that you will create a des- potic government to be your master. The wise despot...maintains among his subjects a popu- lar sense that they are helpless and ineffectual. (Frank Herbert) This was exactly the plan of the Nephilim. It was, and is, one of many adroit strategies they employ to keep us from our power. But it is a very important one. Our myopia toward the question of evil has caused us to lose ardor and strength. We react not to evil as it really is, but only to the chimera of evil created and put before us by our pre- sentient adversary. In so doing, we play right into their hands, actually serving them while impossibly miring ourselves. Our false assumptions about the nature of evil, which cause us to inappropriately, but vehemently, moralize and resist, was instigated after the Nephilim (or their scions) made a close study of the actual nature and opera- tion of the “good,” which to them is a drive like any other, an epiphenomena of the organism and its biotic processes. It is an inconvenience, a malady, inhibiting the free flow of energy and acquisition. Subsequent to their researches, an architecture of dia- lectics and deceit was initiated and propagated. The scions of the Nephilim are not many and they are very vulnerable. This is why they keep their presence a secret and operate covertly from “behind the scenes” where they are safe. Knowing this should empower the lightbearers. The Nephilim's tactics were to employ and utilize an entire army of henchmen who are highly empowered and intelligent, but who are not themselves privy to the inner sanc- tum or to the secret agendas of their controllers. The henchman is paid well and asks few questions. He may even believe himself to be at the helm. So much the better. Some of these ambivalent creatures are forever making the unconscious decision whether to ally with the alien or the human propensities within themselves. They are people of convictions and beliefs. Some are convinced that they are on a crusade for justice or equal rights, etc. Obsessed with their “great cause,” they are convinced that"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Epilogue: Time to Change the Road You’re On 134 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation their personal ambitions are moral and exalted. They exist in blissful ignorance of the fact that their causes, however noble in themselves are, more often than not, designed by their hidden masters as part of an elaborate dialectical scheme to distract attention from the real threat and plight of humanity. So deluded as to their station and vocation, these henchmen feel justified not only in condescending to their lessers, but in gratu- itously satiating their carnal desires and relishing their status and the public recogni- tion that goes with it. Thus, the privileged henchmen, together with their sycophants and countless emulators, become the mannequins dressed for the parts they are to play. Some take to their roles with more gusto than others. (See C. S. Lewis’ That Hideous Strength, Frank Herbert's Dune, or John Christopher's Tripods Trilogy ). The job of the president is not to wield power himself, but to lead attention away from it... (Douglas Adams , The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Universe ) The Blue Degrees are but the outer court...of the temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretation. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them...The true explanation is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry (those of the 32 and 33 degrees). (Albert Pike, Grand Master of US Scottish Rite Freemasonry) These types are over-represented among the world's politicians, generals, lawyers, judges, priests, teachers, bankers, magnates, dictators, and technocrats. Like profes- sional terrorists and criminals, they commit corrupt acts on cue, on a daily basis. But unlike a criminal syndicate, they are not themselves conscious of their dysfunction. Infatuated with their own importance, they feel not the tug of the strings in the hands of their manipulators. The rest of humanity, believing these henchmen to be at the helm, to be ardently seeking to redress the calamities of the world, sit back in their arm chairs and from a comfortable sanitized distance, read about, or voyeuristically watch the wars here, the famines there, the imbroglios and debacles in one place, the civil unrest and human rights abuses in another, the plagues, disasters, crime and vice, the multi-faceted architecture of the machina infernalis, without ever coming to realize that the pieces of the colossal jigsaw will never come together until the picture on the lid of the box, so to speak, is revealed. I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens who, reading newspapers, live and die in the belief that they have known something of what has been passing in their times. (Thomas Jefferson)"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 135 Epilogue: Time to Change the Road You’re On The evil that people think they are fighting is actually a facade, part of the elaborate panoply of deceptions carefully crafted to exhaust precious energies and engender malaise and disenchantment. Their strategy has been overwhelmingly successful. While the so-called “good man” fights the good fight, struggles and endures a lifetime of relative frustration and loss, the “evil” progress and gain more power. Their power grows in proportion with our erroneous countermeasures. When witnessing their ascent, most of us become convinced that all is dark, that there is no way out ahead. We turn off, tune out, or gladly turn to the plethora of distractions made available by these same masters of deception. ...your will is leaving you, slipping away, and you are now beneath my influence. Though your eyes are open, and you seem aware, you are in fact asleep, your faculties dormant, your ability to act and think, subservient to my will... ( The Devil Rides Out with Christopher Lee) Some, in typical Freudian fashion, react to their relative impotency by pathological identification with the masters. Under self-delusion, envy, and awe, this group falls in step even faster, going where they are told, working where they are told, and thinking what they are told to think. The line between man and automaton becomes negligible: Ours is the age which is proud of machines which think and suspicious of men who try to. (H. M. Jones) In our dreams we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docil- ity to our molding hands... (Representative of the Rockefeller General Education Board) . Impotent and jaded, we will remain until we awaken from our comatose state and get connected to our own sovereign power again. The Holy Grail that will take the “scales from our eyes” is nothing more that realizing and changing the perspective dynamics detailed above. To emphasize this point, another illustration may be in order: In the game of chess, the most powerful piece, the king, has, in fact, the most restricted mobility. He can only move one square at a time in any direction. But, it is not his adversary who imposes the said restrictions but the members of his own court. His very defenders impede his range of movement and action. The message and lesson here should be self-evident. Are we not the kings? Regardless of how he has misused power and freedom, the human is still regent of the Earth and the known universe? Our commitment and resolve is contained not by an adversary (alien or other), as much as by our own ineptitude. It is our strategies, or lack of them, that hinder resolution. This"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Epilogue: Time to Change the Road You’re On 136 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation is the consequence of fighting “principalities...in high places” without the correct dis- cernment. Perhaps, we should heed the advice of Christ when he said resist not evil. Now that we are more aware of the reasons for our collective anomie and personal ennui, what kind of positive action can we take? What does an analysis of the dialec- tics tell us about ourselves and about good and evil? The first thing we realize is the incredible intelligence of the adversary. Over centu- ries, they have amassed immense knowledge of us. A web is not made from one thread. (Frank Herbert) You cannot manipulate a marionette with just one string. (Ibid) The next thing we can glean is perfectly enunciated by Frank Herbert who wrote: Merely choosing the good, does not make one good... We have to do more than pay lip service to the truth. We have permitted conditions to get into the sorry state that pervades and are utterly responsible for the mess in which we currently reside. One of the main reasons why we have been so recalcitrant and art- less is that we, as members of the underclass, have unconsciously misapplied and even abused a great gift that we are all a recipient of, namely, education. We, only rather recently, have been extended the “privilege of education” by our imperious masters. It is a privilege that our pre-Industrial forefathers were certainly not permitted to enjoy. The main reason why the underclass was extended the privilege of education was to prevent their uprising in the miasma of the postwar era. After the first world war, there was great social unrest among the people and the youth in particular. This was felt in the upper echelons. Millions were dead and millions had suffered. Cities were devas- tated and economies were shattered. The future was uncertain and the vision of the past had changed forever. The comrade-less hero returned to find that little had changed when it came to daily existence. (See or read, To Serve Them All My Days, Oh! What a Lovely War, Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, The Cinder Path, and the poem, The Motorbike, by Ted Hughes). Meet the new boss...same as the old boss.

As much of the fatalistic literature and poetry of the time indicates, revolution was impending. To appease the conditions, the social architects permitted the first “Socialist” governments to come to power and allowed the ordinary family to send their most accomplished progeny to school. With the privilege of education came man's chance to uncover what has been hidden for so long from him and his fellows. We now have access to the subject of history, but that we know so little about the real events of the past is cause for sorrow and alarm. Moreover, the manner in which such subjects are taught ensures that we remain with little knowledge. Regarding education, we would do well to teach ourselves and our descendants the words of poet Alexander Pope: Drink it deep or touch not the Pyrenean Spring, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Regarding the cabals of academia, what is the general constitution of the type who matriculates? Too often we find that the tendency of the graduated ponderous academe is to become a legend in his own mind. He is utterly fixated on personal interests and peer recognition. Is this not the scenario we often encounter and are frequently seduced into accolading? Has our access to the corridors of learning helped the planet?

Yes, we go to schools and learn. And there is nothing inherently bad about education. But what about the content, the manner of delivery, the “diet”? What about the “malnutri- tion”? Is the consumer the consumed? The solipsistic academe would do well to remember and contemplate that before entry to the prestigious colleges was permitted, there were other archives of knowledge, other paths and modes of learning. There is the story each race, nation, culture and civ- ilization has been telling. These are not tales penned by a single self-absorbed individ- ual, but riveting sagas of entire peoples, orally passed down and sanctified by time. To look to these myths and legends with contempt and intellectual condescension is to covet disaster. The tribulations to which they habitually refer were not written in ink and stone, but in blood, blood dead and blood living. They are in our DNA. The human body is the scriptorium where is kept the greatest gnosis. When will the occi- dental scholar realize that the real Academy, the real Lyceum, the real Library of Alex- andria, the real chambers of Thoth, Hermes, or Merlin are not under a rock in some remote wilderness waiting to be discovered by a wanna-be Indiana Jones. They are in the house of bone, the temple of the nine gates—the human body. The famed “Pillars of Hercules” guarding the way to Atlantis are not of stone. They are the arms of Adam-Kad-Amon. They are the serpentine strands of DNA. The legacy of the Atlanteans is only partly resolved in the physical domain. As said above, no external presence or force will intervene to directly prevent our total annihi- lation. Our predicament (the Nephilim visitation and the quarantine situation, etc.) has its origins in a situation more complex than just being free of a parasite. Parasites come into being for a reason. The predicament is an expression of spiritual meta- themes, the mastering of which will signal advancement for consciousness on all its levels.

Those who “incarnate” on this planet, in this space-time it seems, have to deal with this manifestation of “karma.” Their lives and souls, and not just their planet, become the last battleground and final frontier. Why have we conjured a monster in our midst? That is the question we must ask ourselves. (John Boorman, Zardoz ) So, it appears that mankind's efforts in resisting evil have been an overwhelming fail- ure. It is, therefore, time to put away childish stratagems and begin to deal with the problem of this planet and its dark masters who (though hidden and few) believe them- selves to be invincible. The first theorem we each have to remember from this point on is that the way to com- bat evil of any kind is not to play by the rules which its purveyors create. As the Tao- ists and Zen masters and the masters of Samurai and Martial Arts know, the universal law is that which we identify as evil cannot be overthrown using any force which approximates its own. Problems cannot be solved with the same level of intelligence that created them. (Albert Einstein) The Universe operates by reciprocal laws. The cardinal lesson, therefore, is that one does not set out to destroy evil, for the very thought of doing so engenders cognition and action which immediately disempowers the defendant. Whatever activity is born from such mentation is eventually circumnavigated by the challenger. The universal intelligence itself permits this. This is the reason for evil and why it increases in vital- ity and malignity through time. Victory over the worst evil or tyranny (especially that of a spiritual kind) occurs when the defendant is so inherently strong that the chal- lenger, for all his guile and might, cannot operate or insinuate. When your enemy can- not conquer you, you have won. This is the meta-lesson that under-girds the karmic tests besetting the human inhabitants of planet Earth. This theme of how to conquer evil correctly is beautifully portrayed in the following movies: Man in the Iron Mask, with Richard Chamberlain; The Silent Flute (also called Circle of Iron ) with David Carradine and Christopher Lee; Local Hero with Burt Lancaster; The Sor- ceress; Being There , with Peter Sellers; and Once Upon A Time in the West by Sergio Leone."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Epilogue: Time to Change the Road You’re On 140 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Now that we are aware of how the adversary has siphoned off mankind's precious vitality and what to do about it, we can begin to address what needs to occur during the intermediate stages leading up to the denouement of the fourth outcome . Very importantly, those who are “good” must work in unison. But what kind of work is the individual to do? Is there something that each person regardless of their status can do to bring swift change and redress? To come to this, let us return to the episode which exacerbated the present negative conditions, the opening of the pan-dimen- sional portal to the Dark Archons by Sir John Dee in the sixteenth century. When Sir John Dee, the living “macroscope,” opened the pan-dimensional portal and spoke with the Macrobes, the act was registered in the Akashic Record. It was imme- diately intuited by the descendants of the “Sons of the Serpents,” that is, the descen- dants of the Lemurian civilization who once lived on the pre-diluvian continent of Oceania, which is now beneath the Pacific Ocean. Remnants of this sunken continent are found from Cuba to Hawaii and are repeatedly mis- taken for Atlantis. Atlantis is also believed to be where the Antarctic is now. This is also not correct. The Antarctic is a remnant of one of the five lost continents (Appalachia, Fennos- candia, Beringia, Tyrhennia, and Oceania). It was probably under the control of the Atlante- ans, as was most of the planet, being one of their major epicenters. This could explain why the Nazis, for example, were interested in its secrets. The descendants of the “Sons” (who for now we will term the “Adepts of the Rose”) are endowed with masterful intellects and creative abilities and are constantly warding off the belligerent strategies and advances from their arch-enemies. They keep their identities concealed, but have been attempting (in an endless variety of ways) to awaken their less conscious fellow hybrid humans and to rebalance the planet's etheric energies. (See Lost Horizon with Ronald Coleman). Remember, that every living person is Homo Atlantis, possessing both pure alien and pure human DNA. However, children are born all the time who have the strong DNA of the Lemurians. The human proclivities and sensibilities are then pronounced in them. In the tra- dition of their ancestors, they go on to become the great poets, artists, musicians, philoso- phers, architects, film makers and religious teachers who grace our world. Some live long and prosper, while others die young. Some drive taxi cabs and busk in the streets. Some dance while others heal, some pray while others tell jokes.

I don’t know what the others are here for. (W. H. Auden) The high priests and priestesses within the “Adepts of the Rose” have (from pre-dilu- vian days) closely monitored and counteracted the machinations of their nemesis. In the sixteenth century, they sensed the colossal “rip” in the etheric dimensions and were troubled that their adversarial cousins had committed such a deplorable and prohibited deed. They knew the consequences of necromantic communion with pan-dimensional entities could be incalculable and foresaw much tribulation ahead. They realized that extraordinary measures had to be taken if disaster of cosmic proportions was to be averted. The Adepts called their leaders from all over the planet and held counsel. They finally came to the conclusion that to rebalance the energy another celestial portal had to be opened. Thus, it became necessary to enter into dialogue with the Ascended Masters. The “Adepts of the Rose” realized that without the help of such intelligences there was no hope. The portal was successfully opened and the Ascended Masters were able to give pivotal information. These numinous intelligences are not subject to temporal and spatial laws. As a result, they know more and can see further than any mortal. They do not remedy the problem for us, but instead relay instructions in potentia, leaving the human recipients to translate them into action in their temporal and spatial dimension .

Its dynamics are similar and yet different from those experienced by the children of the Nephilim. (See He Man - Masters of the Universe. ) The communica- tions from such Archons are voluminous and veiled. They, too, are relatively impossi- ble to accomplish. Sacrifices are also required, but not of the kind levied on the children of the Nephilim. Particular resources are needed, and there are also world- wide consequences of the ritual. We seek next to finally disclose some of the most salient points communicated to the “Adepts of the Rose.” The Adepts let it be understood that the Nephilim could not be fought in direct combat or with energy that reciprocates their own natures or machina- tions. The coming of the Nephilim to the sovereign planet Earth was to be compared to a biological infection. It was (and is) nothing more than the infestation of a parasite, a virus, into a normally healthy host organism. The parasite has no life of its own and, hence, no energy that it does not derive from its host. The virus acts slowly and pene- trates the cell, but only when the immune system of the host is malfunctioning. The pathogen cannot be removed allopathically which (as detailed earlier) is the futile tac- tic attempted by those who are under the mesmeric influence of the Masters. The offending pathogen is not removed by radical surgery or by waiting periods where the hope is that it will change its character. The success of eradicating the virus is entirely contingent upon the patient acting in accordance with the advice of any homeopathic doctor. This is what the “Adepts of the Rose” were told by the Ascended Masters. The Shaman knew that on a living body a single cut, wound, infection, or even a cancer should not bring about fatality. This con- tingency occurs only when the organism's immunity is so depleted that it cannot endure. The Shamans within these tribes conducted their age-old rituals and dances at exactly the right sidereal times and at the right geomantic locations on the Earth-grid and by so doing had long posed a threat to their pathogenic nemesis. The Nephilim will be eradicated swiftly and permanently only when the “immune system” of the planet Earth itself is working at 100 percent. Knowing this to be true the scions of the Nephilim, since the time of the Tudors, have seen to it that the indigenous peoples they come across are slaughtered en masse . Hence, mandatory genocide attended their acts of conquest and colonialization. War and genocide were, and still are, the precaution- ary measures to maintain a low biospheric immunity and make conditions suitable for themselves.

As has even scientifically been proven, she is indeed living, and has more of a life than most of us can ever know or experience. She is intelligent and knows exactly what she needs for her well-being. She has been taking care of herself for quite some time. She knows when she is infected or poisoned and knows how to effect precau- tions. Earth has been retarded in her holistic regeneration because her “white blood cells,” her “lymphocytes,” are not doing their work. Her “T” and “B” cell count is con- stantly waning due to toxicity brought on by the presence of the pathogens and the sluggishness of the regenerative agents. The human beings on the face of the planet are the Earth's lymphocytes. Because we are recalcitrant in our duties, the “cell wall,” was penetrated and the parasite was able to invade. Now the time has come for change. What does it mean to be part of the “lymphatics” of a planet? Naturally, it connotes more than just physical responsibilities. Our duty to our extended corpus comprises many levels. Individuals are not identical in appearance or character. Each human “cell” has a different task for which they are perfectly suited. When the human is not doing his or her job, they, like the Earth on which they live, are also in a state of defi- ciency. Healing fails to occur because it is much easier to injure another than to heal oneself. (Vernon Howard) We have been conditioned to believe in the cult of personality to such an extent that we no longer realize any of the details of our “shamanic” duties toward the living Earth. In prehistoric and even pre-Industrial times, the situation was very different. The “Sons of the Serpents” knew that the Earth is a vital and intelligent oracle and knew its lan- guage. This they taught to their descendants and to the Adamic Race. For millennia, the priestess cults held the knowledge of flora and fauna and of herbs and healing. Under the Dominican Order and the Inquisition, they were brought to pay for their her- esies, though the crimes against them from this source were only part of what they have had to endure."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Epilogue: Time to Change the Road You’re On 144 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation The apocalyptic masterpieces of Albrecht Durer (one of the “Sons of the Serpents”) have been misinterpreted as mere representations of common fears of his own time. However, they are not merely myopic sketches of events of his own time. Durer and other artists who treated canonical subjects were “remote viewers,” prophesizing, warning, and revealing. Their iconic allegories deal with timeless meta-themes of which the average critic and also their admirers are unaware. Durer's Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse; St. Michael's Fight against the Dragon; Knight, Death and the Devil; and Melancholia I should be read as fore- casts, as portents of things to come. Artists and minstrels of more recent times also have the same macro-theme in their creations, though few are aware of it...consider the final lines of the song Stairway To Heaven, by Led Zeppelin, and then why millions resonate with this and other masterpieces without knowing consciously why.

Laws, rules, clocks, calendars, and money made their appearance. Since the dynamics of such a life were unfamiliar and incongruent with mankind's essence, schools had to be founded to teach us how to adapt and comply. (See John Christo- pher's The Tripods ). And the Lord said, Look, the people are united, and they all have one language; and this they begin to do, and nothing will stop them from doing what they take in their minds to do...Come on, let us go down, and therefore confound their language so that they cannot understand one another’s speech. (Genesis 11). Homo Sapiens’ connection to the Earth Mother stretches back millions of years prior to the visitation of the Nephilim. It became occluded only in the post-diluvian epoch when the majority of humans were incarcerated in cities and were gradually discon- nected from the land and the elements. The artificiality and relative complexity of municipal existence made it easy for the subtle senses to be markedly debauched. The religions provided imitations for what was removed and lost. The Christian resolve to find the world ugly and bad, has made it ugly and bad. (Fredrick Nietzsche) As the earth in its primitive state is not adopted to our expansion, man must shackle it to ful- fill human destiny. (Jean Vorst, Curator of France’s Museum of Natural History) Urban man's libido was directed toward and aligned with the persona drives, and his thinking became atomistic and linear rather than holotropic and synergistic. This artifi- cial life commenced in a relatively short period of time. With the advent of post-dilu- vian monotheistic religions, the rise of the anthrocentric philosophies and the decline of the primordial egalitarian and ecocentric Stellar and Lunar cults, Homo Atlantis was thrown out of paradise, out of Eden. Deprived of his umbilical connection to the Earth Mother, man took his first step on the road to oblivion. Perhaps we will never fully understand the mystery of that original mutation from egalitar- ian to state society. Certainly no standard explanations are adequate.

(Mark Nathan Cohen , Health and the Rise of Civilization, 1989 ) With agriculture usually comes division of labor, increased sexual inequality, and the begin- nings of social hierarchy. Priests, kings, and organized impersonal warfare all seem to come together in one package. ( Against Civilization, p. 102) . Say what you will about such tribal societies, the record shows that they were (and in some places still are) units of cohesion and sodality, of harmony and regularity, devoid for the most part of crime or addiction or anomie or suicide, with comparatively few needs and those satisfied with a minimum of drudgery, putting in on average maybe four hours a day per person on tasks of hunting and gathering and cultivating, the rest of the time devoted to song and dance and ritual and sex and eating and stories and games... No they did not have the power of five hundred servants at the flick of a switch or the turn of a key, but then they did not have atomic bombs and death camps, toxic wastes, traffic jams, strip mining, orga- nized crime, psychosurgery, advertising, unemployment or genocide. (Kirkpatrick Sale , Rebels Against the Future ) Why did a lifestyle that had been so successful for tens of thousands of years give way to one so different. Modern hunting peoples, though living for the most part in marginal areas, are frequently better nourished and always more leisured than their agrarian neigh- bors...Agrarian peoples not only must work a good deal harder for their sustenance, but are much more precariously balanced in relation to their environment, since they have substan- tially altered the natural ecology of their surroundings. (Dexter Perkins and Patricia Daley) The civilized people believe they have an obligation to bring primitive and underdeveloped people up to their level. Civilization, which is about to self-destruct, thinks of itself as the superior culture that has answers for all the world’s people.... The addict, truly, is a person who is emotionally dependent on things: television, substances, personality routines, other people, mental ideologies, total immersion in some cause or work. If the object of depen- dency is moved, addicts will experience insecurity, discomfort, distress, the symptoms of withdrawal. (William H. Koettke , The Final Empire ) We reproduce catastrophe because we ourselves are traumatized – both as a species and individually, beginning at birth. Because we are wounded, we have put up psychic defenses against reality and have become so cut off from direct participation in the multidimensional wilderness in which we are embedded that all we can do is to navigate our way cautiously through a humanly designed day-to-day substitute world of symbol— a world of dollars, minutes, numbers, images and words that are constantly being manipulated to wring the most possible profit from every conceivable circumstance.

Its spirit is so favorable to tyranny that tyranny always exploits it. True Christians are made to be slaves, they know it, and they are not concerned by that: this short life is too unimportant in their eyes. (Jean Jacques Rousseau , The Social Contract, 4.8 ). Our present servitude is due to the acquiescence of our post-diluvian ancestors who, after the horrific terrestrial and celestial cataclysms they had experienced or heard about, had no choice but to concede to the New World Order of their times. By the invincible power of traditional subservience, the inertia of the general mind, enhanced by the gullibility of ignorance, the masses have slipped under the force of a victim- ization that is both pitiable and tragic. The forces of religion have thus exerted their ruler- ship over a vast segment of humanity and virtually provided the masses with their conventional ideas and concepts as to the meaning of the world ordeal. (Alvin Boyd Kuhn , Ultimate Canon of Knowledge ) Religious thought has detached itself from nature and searches in the illimitable areas of feeling, thought, and wonder for what understanding these may yield it. With no guides, checks, clues or competent intelligence to recognize truth, imagination all too readily con- jures up wayward, extravagant and strange surmises as to the presence and intervention of forces not naturally operative...Religion is not the realm of knowledge, or even of thought, but purely of belief, as for the masses.

(From William Blake ’s The Garden of Love ) Fortunately, not all civilizations were founded on the Atlantean pattern. The ecocentri- cally minded indigenous peoples of the world, descendants of the Lemurians, never forgot their shamanic duties as is revealed in their works and words and in the manner in which they existed. The native American Indians, the Aboriginals, the Druids, the Pharaonic priests, and the matriarchal societies all attended to this sovereign duty. They were caretakers and protectors, and they encoded into their sundry rituals and ceremonies the harmonics and vibrational intonations which resonated with the merk- aba of the planet. The “Sons of the Serpents” and their Adamic wards propagated and disseminated their wealth of knowledge. They created their own nations and infused their influence over peoples and nations. The strongest strains of their progeny were largely responsible for the high cultures of Egypt and also, to some extent, of early Greece (i.e., Etruscan and Mycenaean). In every case, where this particular influence arose an adoration of and a return to nature was noticeable. For the Lemurians and their progeny, there was and is no separation between the microcosm and the macrocosm. Matter is energy is con- sciousness. That is why there can be a rapport between psychic and physical energy. The Earth and myself are of one mind. (Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce) Whether I live or die, I am Osiris, I enter in and reappear through you, I decay in you; I grow in you; I fall down in you; I fall upon my side. The gods are living in me, for I live and grow in the corn that sustains the Honored Ones. I cover the earth, whether I live or die I am Barley, I am not destroyed. I have entered the Order, I rely upon the Order, I become Master of the Order, I emerge in the Order, I make my form distinct, I am the Lord of the Chennet (Granary of Memphis), I have entered into the Order, I have reached its limits. . . (Egyptian: Coffin Text 330) I f we turn to ancient Egypt, we learn...that the religious consciousness of early Egyptian civ- ilization was saturated by the aura and influence of nature. (Alvin Boyd Kuhn) In all their works [the ancients] proceeded on definite principles of fitness and in ways derived from the Truth of Nature. Thus they reached perfection, approving only those things which, if challenged, can be explained on the grounds of truth.

The temples are groves. The air as spirit naturally held men's souls between incarna- tions. (Ross Nichols, High Druid of England) The modern world is not at all cognizant of the splendid achievement of the ancient civiliza- tions of two lands at least, namely Egypt and Greece, in so relating their minds to the order of nature that their life in general flowered out in a state of health and wholesomeness that has hardly been matched in the history of the world since. History discloses that the daily life of the Egyptian citizen was one lived in close and intimate relation with the life of nature. No one can study the life of the Greek people of two to three millennia ago without recognizing the tremendous part that what they called physis, or nature, played in their modus of living both at the physical and the intellectual level. Their philosophy, which is still regarded as the heyday of the human achievement in that field, was solidly based on the foundations of all conceptuality found in the order of the natural world. Man and the meaning of his life were not envisaged as detached from the material world, but as of kindred nature with it and in its higher ranges an efflorescence from it. (Alvin Boyd Kuhn , The Ultimate Canon of Knowl- edge ) If one is in true connection with nature, it follows that there is no gender dichotomy. Women are not only treated as equals but are regarded as living agents (even portals) to the mysteries of nature and being. The very word mystery comes from “mesta” meaning “woman” in Egyptian. The scholar Max Muller wrote: No people ancient or modern has given woman so high a legal status as did the inhabitants of the Nile Valley. The Egyptian women were entrusted with the civilization. The woman (princess), and not the male, was the legal heir to the throne, and the man she chose to marry would become the ruling Pharaoh. ( Moustapha Gadalla , Historical Deception) ...and the kingdom became dead and desert, for they lost the voices of the wells and the dam- sels that were therein. (The Elucidation) As civilizations became corrupted by the infusion of alien elements and influences, the connection to and respect for nature and, for that matter woman, drastically waned.

From Lucretius, Plotinus, Shakespeare, Blake, Rousseau, Spinoza, Schelling, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Shelley, Swami Aurob- indo, and a host of others, we have vehement promethean remonstrations against man's nescience and impiety, against mankind's ignominious avoidance of the organic. Their impassioned entreaties for restitution and reverence have largely gone unheeded. It is a sin to suppose that Nature, endowed with perennial fertility by the Creator of the Uni- verse, is affected with barrenness, as though with some disease and it is unbecoming to a man of good judgement to believe that Earth, to whose lot was assigned a divine and ever- lasting youth, and who is called the common mother of all things and is destined to bring them forth continually, has grown old in mortal fashion. And, furthermore, I do not believe that such misfortunes come upon us as a result of the fury of the elements, but rather because of our own fault, for the matter of husbandry, which all the best of our ancestors had treated with the best of care, we have delivered over to all the worst of our slaves, as if to a hangman for punishment. (Columella , De Agricultura ) This universe is a living organized effective complex, all comprehensive, displaying an unfathomable wisdom. How, then, can any one say that it is not a clear image, beautifully formed, of the intellectual verities? No one seeing the loveliness lavished in the world of sense. . . could be so dull-witted as not to be carried by all this to recollection and gripped by reverent awe. . . Such a one could have neither fathomed this world nor have had any vision of that other. We must recognize that even in the world of sense and part, there are things of a loveliness comparable to that of the celestials, which fill us with veneration for their Creator and convince us of their origin in the divine forms, which show how ineffable is the beauty of the Supreme. (Plotinus) I feel an indescribable ecstasy and delirium in melting, as it were, into the system of beings, in identifying myself with the whole of nature. (Jean Jacques Rousseau) Everything on earth is in a continual flux - nothing stays constant or fixed. Our attachments to external things pass and change as things do. But there is one state where the soul finds a solid enough seat to rest and gather in all its being, with no need to recall the past or to press on to the future; a state where time is nothing, where the present lasts forever, with no mark of duration or trace of succession; a state where there is no feeling of deprivation or enjoyment, pleasure or pain, desire or fear—only that of our simple existence, which fills our soul entirely... What is it that one is enjoying in such a situation? Nothing exterior to oneself, nothing but oneself and one's own existence. As long as this state lasts one is self-sufficient like God.

Her analogy applies perfectly to our present thesis. David, she writes, destroyed his monstrous enemy because he did four important things: He identified his enemy, he overcame his fear, he found a weak spot, and he used a simple weapon. It should now be clear what kind of consciousness and behavior will precipitate the fourth outcome mentioned in this chapter. The outcome asked for a remedy that is rel- atively non-violent, attractive to all peoples from any class or culture, and guaranteed to be 100 percent successful. The answer is that we, the present occupants of the planet, make a conscious return to the land (to the Earth) and that we begin again to apply the rituals preserved by the Shamanic traditions of our individual races. In so doing, we strengthen the “immune system” of the biosphere, which then allows the Earth (in its own mysterious manner) to destroy or repel the offending presence. Thus, the pathogens infecting her become eradicated in a way that is sane, healthy, and per- manent. When the sleepers awaken and make a return to the Earth, a great circle of time closes. Men and women return to the human, as opposed to the alien, within themselves, becoming their own priests and priestesses. The separation between the microcosm and the macrocosm passes away forever, like a shadow in the architecture of a night- mare, and the true Renaissance of Humankind begins.

Flint and Otto O. Binder This great book asks the questions that science should have been asking rather than covering up. The authors also advocate intervention and interference from alien species. Immanuel Velikovsky on Darwinism “Most controversial is the evolutionary question. I have done a great deal of work on Darwin and can say with some assurance that Darwin did not derive his theory from nature but rather superimposed a certain philosophical world-view on nature and then spent 20 years trying to gather the facts to make it stick.” (Introduction) Advent of Man Yet the point of Man’s emergence as a human-being, the threshold of his attainment of personality and spirit— these are still shrouded in the shadows of the prehistoric past. (p. 5) Catastrophe Removed Fossil Record Evidence “...a noted newspaper wrote that the “chief puzzle” in the life record of the ancient earth is how, 600 million years ago, the basic divisions of species of the plant and animal kingdom have already “sud- denly appeared.” There being no earlier fossil record, this meant “the first part of the evolutionary his- tory is missing. The authors go on to pose several important questions: • Why is it that an analysis of the six spreading movements of primitive Man indicates that three of these spreading movements came from Asia Minor? • Why are there Men in white, yellow, brown, red and black skin? • The race (Aurignacian or Cro-Magnon Man) that possibly swept away Neanderthal Man approxi- mately 35,000 years ago in Europe had a larger brain capacity by 100 cubic centimeters than modern Man...where did this huge brain-case, three times the volume of a gorilla’s come from? • Why did the homo branches of both Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon Man, who had brain cases larger than modern Man, never, through a period of 60,000 years, create civilization, living instead as brutes? (p. 6) • Why did civilization spring up with an abruptness in Sumeria (10,000 B.C.) which makes the anthropologists gasp to this day? How could mankind change from a Neolithic savage...to a social being with villages and agriculture overnight, so to speak? • Why is there a lack of explanation for Man’s greater intelligence arising out of strict Evolution? All of the lesser animals—the dog, cat, horse, elephant, and others—had the same number of years in which to develop—by Evolution’s natural selection or mutations, or both—the surpassing intelligence of Man. Yet Man alone achieved this. Why? How? The evolutionists do not know. Although all the other warm-blooded inhabitants of Earth have been evolving as long as we humans, not one of them has a brain that is over a hundredth (1/100) the total weight of his body...Man’s brain on the other hand is one-thirtieth (1:30) of his total weight. Where did this great difference come from?"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 163 Appendix B: Book Abstracts The 312 Differences of Man Why is it that Man is unique in so many ways among all primates that roam the world? He has 312 dis- tinctive physical traits that set him apart from his so-called primate cousins: • The human female is in heat without interruption. • Man is the only true hairless mammal. • Only Man cries copious tears. • Man has delicate fingers and sensitive skin. • The human skin has a slow healing rate. • Man lacks tooth gaps. • Subcutaneous fat exists in humans only. • Man has extraordinary facial mobility. • Man has unique speaking apparatus. • Man swallows slowly. • Man has incredible eyes and seeing ability. • He makes sophisticated tools. Where did the ancients, as long as 2,000 years ago, learn an advanced form of mathematics that allowed calculations of the Earth’s size, and pinpoint the eclipses of the Sun and Moon? How could machineless mankind in B. C. and early A. D. times perform incredible engineering feats, such as building the pyramids and other stone structures so huge they would even tax modern machin- ery to duplicate? Why is it that no ape brain, according to exhaustive tests, displays the fantastic higher qualities of Man’s brain, such as genius, imagination, scientific inspiration, and less flattering, schizophrenia? Why do human beings alone, apart from any animal, have religion? Alfred R. Wallace Discovered “Natural Selection” previous to Darwin and with him was the founder of the Evolutionist Theory. But on reviewing the startling differences between Homo Sapiens and other mammals, he real- ized that Man was an exception to the rules He amazingly wrote: “... some intelligent power has guided or determined the development of Man” “Nature never overendows a species beyond the demands of everyday existence.” Why Religion? An important question is why religion. Why did humankind, originally one with the natural order, decide to have gods or religious beliefs? Are the traditional reasons for this, put before us, by historians and theorists, etc., sustainable when we take on board the concept of alien intervention? Does the religious sensibility come as a result of the terrible catastrophes, as mentioned in innumerable native traditions.

If, however, the most of the world’s present major ranges attained their existing elevations a mere 11,000 years ago, where was the high land attracting heavy snowfalls and providing the ice and the motive power for the alleged ice- sheets specifically stated to have preceded the modern uplands.

(p. 24) Today, the world’s coldest known land region is north-eastern Siberia. There, if anywhere, we might expect huge ice-sheets to have developed if the Ice Age theory possessed validity. Yet comparatively very few areas of Siberia exhibit signs of significant glaciation, either past or present. Clearly great cold does not itself of itself necessarily promote the development of ice-sheets. (p. 39) Again, in start contrast to orthodox Ice Age theory, even many northern areas outside Siberia said to have lain under the thickest parts of the alleged ice-sheets afford scant evidence of glaciation or ice- sculpturing of any sort, and in numerous cases are actually devoid of it. (p. 39) ...northern latitudes have yielded several unexpected discoveries totally at variance with the tenet of vast sprawling North Polar ice-sheets. Their collective message is a singular one.

Was it because, as intimated earlier, glacial action actually never occurred there? (p. 42) ...snowfall during Ice Age times was not appreciably heavier than that of today. (p. 42) We can scarcely continue to associate the development of massive ice-sheets with mountain systems generally too low to have acted as effective causal agents of such glaciation. (p. 42) Typical “drift” deposits occur far outside allegedly glaciated regions, or, conversely, are absent from many others believed to have been heavily glaciated. Abnormally buried organic remains in otherwise typical “drift” deposits often occur in latitudes inimical to large-scale ice action. These are inescapable facts strongly mitigating against the popular explanation of the origin of these great deposits. (p. 135) Thus, if many of today’s highest mountains were much lower when the alleged Ice Age was reputedly at its zenith, how did so much ice, if it actually existed, manage to accumulate? Indeed we can take a step further and ask whether the ice-sheets so beloved of glacialists ever existed at all! (p. 42) The underlying problem, of course, has been the continued acceptance of the constraints inherent in Lyell’s “uniformitarianism”, with its insistence upon terrestrial agencies being the sole generators of observable topographical and atmospheric changes...

Accordingly, it has been common to reserve a span of two or more million years for the duration of the Pleistocene “period.” Such concepts are seriously at variance with the field evidence, for if the glaciations of orthodoxy (the “Ice Age”) never really existed, and if the singular “drift” deposits accredited to them were accumulated at comparatively great speed, then the duration of the Pleistocene epoch must actually have been unexpectedly brief. (p. 135) Instead of being a distinct geological epoch of appreciable duration, the Pleistocene...appears therefore to have been little more than a rather brief “stage.” The time allegedly occupied by the glacial and inter- glacial episodes of conventional Pleistocene chronology was actually non-existent. Conversely, the Pliocene period persisted to very much more recent times than has been hitherto been commonly sup- posed. (p. 136-7) The term “Pleistocene” is therefore retained as a “stage” rather than as an “epoch” (p. 137) The Miocene and Pliocene Epochs The generally equable conditions characteristic of Pliocene times were highly favorable to the develop- ment and proliferation of life-forms of all kinds, and in that respect, did not materially differ from the equally genial Miocene period which preceded it.

Robert Milton’s astounding book offers stunning evidence demonstrating this date an incorrect fabrica- tion. Clearly, whatever caused the origin and evolution of humankind can only be discovered with the kind of common sense and unbiased researches of scholars such as Robert Milton, those who do not abuse public resources or confidence. The author confronts the misuse of public resources and confi- dence by the members of the esteemed scientific community and proves that scientific research is rarely accurate or uncontaminated by hidden agendas and government interference. Findings from this remarkable and long awaited book have a direct bearing on “Catastrophist” theory and also on the theo- ries of alien intervention and genetic hybridization. The Author Asks Who do you have to be to have a voice about scientific research on which large sums of public money are spent? Who decides who you have to be? In what forum, or by what mechanism, can the voices of dissent ever be heard in science? It is not just outsiders who cannot be heard, it is dissenting members of the scientific professions them- selves....It is worrying to learn that in countries like Great Britain and the United States, thought to be among the most civilized on Earth, some professional scientists can feel so isolated and ignored that they have to take their case directly to the public via the popular press. Equally, it is depressing to dis- cover that in countries which pride themselves on their intellectual tolerance, it is impossible to voice scientific dissent without attracting this kind of response from those who perceive to be the guardians of orthodoxy. The Established Paradigm Stated The Earth is of immense antiquity, formed 4, 600 million years ago; life on this planet is also of very great age – emerging spontaneously in the ancient seas 3,000 million years ago – and the great variety of species that exist today are all descended from one or a few primitive organisms evolved in those ancient oceans, by a process of random genetic mutation coupled with natural selection. These ideas are the cornerstones of modern historical geology and of our contemporary world view, as familiar to the elementary school pupil as to the postgraduate student of biology or geology. (p. 5) Problem Existing methods of geochronometry such as uranium-lead decay and radiocarbon assays have been found to be deeply flawed and unreliable; the extent of genetic change by selection has been found experimentally to be limited. Bacteria can be induced in the laboratory to mutate in a direction that is beneficial to them—without generations of natural selection; only a catastrophist model of development can account for important Earth structures and processes such as continental drift and most fossil-bear- ing rock formations—most of the Earth’s surface in fact. (p. 6) It’s All Accident! Do we really believe that black people are black by accident? What kind of accident was it? Why don’t we see such accidents happening today? Why does the fossil record not show us such accidents happen- ing in the past? Once the questions begin, it is difficult to know where to stop. For instance, if we don’t see genetic mutations—the accidents of inheritance—happening because they are very rare, then how can there have been enough time for them to produce anything as complex as"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Appendix B: Book Abstracts 176 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation humans?...And if nature can produce such rich diversity as the present animal and plant kingdoms by pure chance, why is it that thousands of years of serious guided election by humans has resulted only in trivial sub-specific variation of domestic plants and animals, while not one new species has been cre- ated? (p. 9) Darwinians One And All An important factor in bringing about the universal dominance and acceptance of Darwinian evolution has been that virtually every eminent professional scientist appointed to posts in the life sciences in the last 40 or 50 years, in the English-speaking world, has been a convinced Darwinist. (p. 12) The Big Question I want to begin this examination with a closer look at what is probably the central issue: the age of the Earth. The reason that this issue assumes key importance is because the central mechanism of neo-Dar- winism, genetic mutation, means change has to take place at an agonizingly slow pace, requiring hun- dreds of millions or even billions of years. If the Earth is of such an age, then neo-Darwinism could be true. If the Earth is not of such an age, then the theory of cannot be true—despite what other evidence may indicate. (p. 14) ...the age now universally accepted for the Earth is so vast—4,600 million years—as to allow life to have evolved not once but many times. But let us use our imaginations for a moment to ask two hereti- cal questions. Does an age of 4,600 million years really provide enough time for evolution to have worked along Darwinian lines? And—even more outrageous—what if the Earth is not as old as we think? (p. 15) The Darwinian View What has to happen for life to get started in the primeval oceans and to develop by mutation and natural selection into the animal and plant kingdoms we see today? First, the inert chemicals in the sea must form amino acids, probably under the influence of ultraviolet light and electrical discharges in the form of lightening...The Darwinian view is that although the formation of protein molecules without any precursor is highly improbable, it could have occurred given enough time—hundreds of millions of years. (p. 16) Problem : Life is not spontaneously emerging today in the seas. Running Out of Millennia But let us be generous and allow the full 600 million years. What is a few million years when we have so many at our disposal? This interval must accommodate not only the spontaneous combination of basic materials into amino acids, but also the combination of amino acids into protein molecules, the appear ace of at least one self-replicating molecule, and the subsequent evolution of this molecule into self-replicating cellular bodies to the bacterial level. And remember that of these four steps, one alone (the second) has been estimated to happen by chance once in 1,000 million years...So, of the 4,600 mil- lion years of geological time that Darwinists have granted themselves, only a small fraction—less than 600 million—is available to accommodate the processes they believe to have taken place. Darwinian evolutionary processes are already running short of time. (p. 17) Strictly speaking, Darwinism is not concerned with abiogenesis—the appearance of life from inanimate matter—but only with the subsequent evolution of those primitive organisms into more highly devel- oped species.

The probability calculated by Yockley and confirmed by Sauer’s experiments—1 chance in 10 to the power of 65—is an event so improbable that it could be compared to winning the state lottery by finding the winning ticket in the street, and then continuing to win the lottery every week for a thousand years, finding the winning ticket in the street each time—possible, in principle, if you have eternity at your disposal, but improbable, in practice, if all you have is a negligibly short time. (p. 19) ...an Earth of immense age is indispensably necessary to the neo-Darwinists theory because genetic mutation and natural selection are processes that are conceived of as working very slowly over hundreds of millions of years. If the Earth was only a few million years old, then there simply would not have been enough time for natural selection to work. Whether we liked it or not, we would be compelled to seek a fresh explanation for the origins of living species. (p. 19) The important point to note here is that it was the imperative need for great antiquity that deposed cata- strophism, rather than any new scientific discoveries or observations; it was a new way of looking at things, not a new piece of knowledge. But, superficially the change in view seemed to be a shift away from naïve belief in biblical tales of creation and flood, and toward a newly established scientific view- point. (p. 28) Radiocarbon Dating Invented by Willard Libby and first applied in 1949....radioactive dating techniques are far less reliable than was previously thought; the Earth could be much younger than has been supposed by Darwinists; and nothing like the billions of years required by evolution have elapsed since the Earth’s formation. (p. 30) Note : The amount of carbon 14 in the world erroneously thought to be constant. Dr. Melvin Cook Cook showed for example that if you used the uranium-decay method on the rocks of the crust you got the conventionally accepted age of over four thousand million years. But if you used the selfsame method on the atmosphere, you got an age of only a few hundred thousand years. He also showed that the entire amount of “radiogenic” lead in the world’s two largest uranium deposits could be entirely modern. Clearly, something was wrong. (p. 18) Funkhouser and Naughton at the Hawaiian Institute of Geophysics used the potassium-argon method to date volcanic rocks from Mount Kilauea and got ages up to 3 thousand million years—when the rocks are known to have been formed in a modern eruption in 1801. McDougall at the Australian National University found ages of up to 465,000 years from lava in New Zealand that is independently known to be less than 1,000 years old. (p. 18) Coal – True Revealer of the Past In 1878, miners at Bernissart, a small village in the Mons coalfield of Southwest Belgium, made a spec- tacular discovery when they uncovered a fissure in the coal seam packed full of intact dinosaur skele- tons, at a depth of 322 meters. Thirty-nine skeletons of the dinosaur iguanodon were recovered, from a fissure 100 feet high, many of them complete...The most striking thing about these creatures is that they measured 10 meters in length, stood several meters high, and weighed in the region of 2 tons each. For their bodies to be rapidly buried would require rates of deposition thousands or even millions of times greater than the average 0.2 millimeters per year proposed by uniformitarians.

Efforts were made to block the dissemination of Dr. Velikovsky’s ideas and even to punish supporters of his investigations.

The system was devised some 200 years ago by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linne and has subsequently been adopted by the international scientific community. (p. 115) Scientific Lingo And once the taxonomic categories of “species,” “genus,” “family,” and the like are admitted to be no more than convenient metaphors or contrivances, then we are left simply with a biological realm that consists of individuals —all of which are different.

(p. 123) Tautology Restated, the “survival of the fittest” means: the prolific breeding of the most prolific breeders. Put this way, does natural selection mean anything at all? (p. 123) The modern position, therefore, is that natural selection and the survival of the fittest are no more than empty tautologies, while the struggle for survival plays no important part in evolution. (p. 128) Thus “survival of the fittest,” or “natural selection,” or differential reproduction” sheds no light on the mechanism of evolution and is only another way of saying that some animals survive and prosper while others die out — and observation of limited value.

Seen from outer space, the planet Earth has a rainbow like halo. Olympian Period Zeus overthrows the Titan Kronus, who ruled over the Golden Age. This act initiated the Olympian Age. Kronus is said to have been banished from the city of the Gods and was interred, “chained,” in Britain. Same as Saturn, who was said to have been sent in chains to Albion. He was the oldest of the gods. Could it be that this was one of the original galactic invaders that was captured by the Serpent People. Is this where the legend of the chaining of Satan in the pit derives from? The Moon The Moon’s orbit was nearer to the Earth about 13,000 B.C. because the orbit of the Earth was more elliptical than at present. The Moon also had two satellites of its own. In myth, Diana, the Moon god- dess, had two hounds. The proximity of the Moon caused major convulsions. Hence, the Moon became associated with driving men mad. Around 9,500 B.C. Earth captured the Moon as her own satellite and this was attended by massive upheavals. The Moon is known to be significantly larger than the satellites of other planets. Seven Islands The Hindus claim that there were seven islands separated by seven oceans. These seem to be references to the planets in the heavens. Carnac In Brittany, there are also serpent temples with rows of stones and a winding serpent that go on for 8 miles. Carnac derives from Carn Hak, that is Serpent Hill, or Hill of the Serpents.

A forgotten city called Posideium, also known as Mina, lies in to the north of Lebanon in the Turkish Hatay. Poseidon’s symbol was also the trident. This later became the thunder- bolt of Zeus. Moses and the Burning Bush Jehovah announces himself as the “god of thy father.” It was not until the time of the prophet Amos that Jehovah is raised to the level of the Universal Lord and creator god. Jeremiah and Ezekiel also followed suit. The Sakhra A sacred stone of the Israelites that was contained in their Temple of Solomon. But, it was an object of veneration long prior to this time. The Ashlar of the Freemasons is probably an analogue of it. Age of Aquarius The Age of Aquarius opened 1750 A.D.; Planet Uranus was discovered in 1781. Then there came the inventions of the steam engine, airplane, etc. Technology became vogue, and so on. In both the Bible history and Plato’s story, the destruction of the people was largely caused by the inter- marriage of the superior or divine race “the Sons of God” with the inferior stock, “the children of men,” whereby they were degraded and rendered wicked.

In about 1580, the famous scholar and magician, Dr. Dee, discovered what he believed to be Merlin’s secret in the Glastonbury plains. According to his recent biographer, Richard Deacon, he became interested in the “unusual arrangement of the prehistoric earthworks in the Glastonbury area and had diagnosed that these objects when carefully mapped represented the signs of the Zodiac and the stars.” (p. 10) Comment It is obviously not by chance that Dee suddenly makes such a discovery. He must have had books containing information of the prediluvian epoch. Dee possessed most of the books that were said to have burned in the dissolution of the Catholic monasteries, under Henry VIII (Tudor). These books were kept at his house at Mortlake, on the Thames River. Seismic Upheaval There is reason to consider that a tremendous seismic upheaval occurred on the Earth’s surface at approximately 25,000 B.C. There is strong evidence that there was another around 1,300 B.C. And finally, the island of Poseid...was submerged about 9,500 B.C. However, the British Isles still exist. (p. 20) The British Isles were suggestively named the Fortunate Lands or the Isles of the Blest , by the ancients. Is this because they survived when Atlantis sank? Luna Originally, the third planet from the Sun, she had two moons of her own. Known as Diana to the ancients. Earth sometimes came close, in orbit, to Luna, which caused upheavals, and change of magne- tism. At one point, the magnetism of Earth captured one of Luna’s moons and it crashed into the Earth around 13,000 years ago. The other moon exploded leaving Luna as the sole satellite of the Earth.

The Desolation of Humans And how did mankind come to be reduced to a handful? If men grew, in the first instance, out of bestial forms, mindless and speechless, they would have propagated and covered the world as did the bear and the wolf. But after they had passed this stage and had so far developed as to be human in speech and brain, some cause reduced them again to a handful. What was it?

Viracocha of Peru Called the White One. “He constructed the Sun and Moon and created the inhabitants of the earth. The latter attacked him with murderous intent.” He civilized the Peruvians, taught them arts and agriculture and religion; they called him the “teacher of all things.” He came from the east and disappeared into the Western Ocean. Four civilizers followed him who emerged from the cave Pacarin Tampu, the House of Birth. These four brothers were also called Viracochas, white men.

The Copper Age It is remarkable that so few antique copper implements have been found (in Europe), although a knowl- edge of that metal must have been the preliminary stage in the manufacture of bronze.

These things were known in Mesopotamia and Canaan; they were written down and readily available in the temple libraries of Babylon, and so they could not be ignored— but they could be reinterpreted... Enki, the wise hero of Sumer, could be portrayed (in accordance with his emblem) as a troublesome serpent—an image which could incorporate Lilith too, for she held the matri- lineal heritage of the kingdom: the Malkhut, the sovereignty of the Dragon. The Nature of the Brothers Enki was more liberal minded, whereas Enlil was severe. He was considered inviolable by his followers that worshipped him out of fear of retribution. Gardner Writes on Enlil “...it was he who had instigated the Semitic invasions which led to the “confusion of tongues” and the fall of Sumer. It was he that brought about the devastating flood, and it was he who had leveled the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah—not because of their wickedness, as related in Genesis...but because of the wisdom and insight of their inhabitants, as depicted in the Coptic Paraphrase of Shem.

In the light of these latter day discoveries, we are now far wiser than our parents and forbearers, for we now know and have at hand the Sumerian and Akkadian documentation which enabled the Captivity Jews to compile their ancestral story. What we know is that their biblical account was not an accurate transcript of ancient records, but a strategically compiled set of documents which distort the annals of the original scribes in order to establish a new cultural and religious doctrine. This was the doctrine of the One God—Jehovah—a doctrine born out of fear that was contrary to all tradition and historical record in the contemporary and preceding environments.

Then we read that Abraham is asked to sacrifice Isaac. Jehovah promises that Isaac and his line will possess Egypt. Researchers have wondered at this pro- nouncement. (See p. 164) Jehovah also asks Abraham to observe the custom of circumcision, known only in Egypt. Sarah and the Pharaoh Upon arrival in Egypt, Sarah enters into the household of a Pharaoh, Senusret I, who wants to marry her. Subsequently Abraham pretends not to be her husband but her brother. It turns out that Sarah is the Pha- raoh’s half sister, and it is normal for Pharaoh’s to wed their sisters. Isaac, Son of Pharaoh, not Abraham It is thought, therefore, that Isaac is in fact, not the son of Abraham, but of the Pharaoh Senusret I. “If Isaac is the son of Pharaoh Senusret, then the seemingly enigmatic details of the covenant would fall very neatly into place. We could then understand Sarah’s change of name to Sarah (Princess). Similarly, the custom of circumcision would make sense, as would the prospect of future dynastic kingship in the Egyptian domain. It would even explain the relevance of the mysterious ‘birthright’ that was eventually sold by Isaac’s son Esau to his brother Jacob (Genesis 25:30-34). (p. 165) But what Genesis does not make clear is the precise nature of the birthright granted by Esau to Jacob. (p. 168) Line of Judah The Bible relates that, in due time, King David of Israel and his dynasty sprang from the line of Judah, a son of Esau’s brother Jacob, but in the original scheme of things, had the birthright not been sold, the kingly descent would rightly have been from Esau.

Ishmael was the son of Hagar the Pharaoh’s daughter, while his wife Mahalath is also the daughter of Pharaoh Amenem- het II. Therefore, the blood of Esau’s descendants is noble and royal.

There they remained until lead out again by ‘Moses.’ Ramesis II and Exodus In apparent confirmation of the Israelite’s sojourn in Egypt, the annals of Pharaoh Ramesis II (the Great) make reference to Semitic people who settled in the delta region of Goshen, but this does not really help because they are not specified as Israelites, but included in the Arab races of Syria, Phoeni- cia, Mesopotamia, and the Fertile Crescent in general.

The information about the first Joseph was concealed so that he could be identified as the one much later that became the Pharaoh of Egypt. (See p. 180) The Real Joseph A later Genesis entry, which is seldom quoted, has Joseph saying, “God hath made me a father to the Pharaoh.” (Genesis 45:8) ...could not have related to Joseph, son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery. But was there perhaps a grand vizier who fathered a Pharaoh – a prestigious governor after whom a canal might have been named and who would have ridden in the king’s second chariot...Indeed there was: a vizier who, con- trary to normal custom, was embalmed like a pharaoh (precisely as described in the last verse of Gene- sis) and entombed in a fine sarcophagus in no less a place than the royal burial ground—the Valley of the Kings at western Thebes (modern Luxor). (p. 183) The Inscription on His Tomb Egyptian tomb inscriptions usually relate, in one way or another, to the godhead under which the occu- pant was placed in life, using deiform names such as Ra, Amen, and Ptah. In this case, the unusual tomb inscriptions of the grand vizier do not relate to any known god of Egypt; they reveal instead such names as Ya - y a , and Yu - y a , —phonetically, Iouiya , which is akin to Yaouai , a variant of Yahweh or Jehovah. From these inscriptions, the vizier has become personally known as Yu y a , and this is of particular inter- est because his grandson, Pharaoh Akhenaten later developed the ‘One God’ concept in Egypt. (p. 182- 183) Yuya (Yusuf) was the principal minister for the eighteenth dynasty Pharaoh, Tuthmosis IV (c. 1413- 1405 B.C.) and for his son Amenhotep III...His tomb was discovered in 1905, along with that of his wife Tuya (the Asenath), and the mummies of Yuya and Tuya are among the very best preserved in the Cairo Museaum...Clearly, this couple was of tremendous importance in their day; this becomes obvious from Yuya’s funerary papyrus, which refers to him as ‘The Holy Father of the Lord of the Two Lands’...as does his royal funerary statuette.

The Amarna Kings Isaac’s son Esau—“...may have sold his birthright to his younger twin brother Jacob-Israel (whose descendants became kings of Judah), but now through Tuya and Yuya, descendants of Esau did indeed become pharaohs of Egypt. These particular pharaohs became known as the “Amarna Kings”— they were Akhenaten, Smenkhare, Tutankhamun and Aye, who ruled consecutively c. 1367-1348 B.C. (p. 184) Palestine remained under Egyptian rule at this time. If the covenant was to be taken literally, it would appear that the selling of the birthright by Esau to Jacob had no effect whatever; it was not until after the Amarna period that the lines from Esau and Jacob were united through marriage, subsequently descend- ing to the Davidic kings of Judah. (p. 184) Moses Manetho stated that Moses was a priest at Heliopolis. Manetho Manetho says that Moses was a Heliopolitan Priest dismissed to the mines because he contracted lep- rosy. After the lepers were sent at their own request to Avaris, Moses became their leader. He prohibited the worship of other gods and permitted animal sacrifice. He also sent to Jerusalem for 200,000 “shep- herds,” really called Solomites or the Hyskos, to come to Egypt that had once been expelled by Pharaoh Thotmosis. On the arrival of these people, the Pharaoh of the times called Amenophis retreated to Mem- phis and then to Ethiopia. The Solomites and false Egyptians set fire to houses and treated the populace disgracefully. They also stole all the wealth of the country. After 13 years, Amenophis returned and con- quered these usurpers. (See p. 124 of Sacred Science Chronicles by Robert Siblerud) Josephus says he commanded the Egyptian army in the Ethiopian war. Adopted by a Princess It would have been very unlikely for an unmarried princess to adopt. Moses Cast on the River Despite the complete illogicality of this action...the story then becomes even more implausible, for along came the Pharaoh’s daughter, who seemed to care nothing for her father’s dictate. She discovered the baby and immediately began conversing with the boy’s sister, who just happened to be close by. The sister then returned the baby to its mother, who was paid by the princess to nurse him. Hence, the boy was back were he began, and any fear of the authorities and their death-threat seems to have been con- veniently forgotten. Eventually the princess adopted the boy as her own son and called him Moses, with no one leveling any query about the child’s natural parents.

(See p. 188) Power of the Israelites Because of the long ministry of Joseph, there was fear that his daughter, the Israelite wife of the Pha- raoh, would bear a child that would have royal blood. As she was not the legitimate heiress, she could not represent the State god, Amen (Amun). (See p. 188) First Son of Tiye The Israelite princess did of course become pregnant.

Aten was not the Sun god, however, for the Egyp- tian Sun god was Ra. (p. 189) The First Religious Intolerance The Israelite concept of a god without an image was already established in Egypt before Akhenaton came on the throne. What he did that was so different was to install Aten as the sole god of Egypt, and this is the world’s first example of religious intolerance at State level – a strict monotheism foisted upon the people (p. 190).

The mist had barely cleared the vessel when the first case of dis- ease was announced. (p. 190) There were also frequent reports of loud noises in the sky, or rumblings. A huge “blazing star” was seen in the sky over England, even by Charles II, before the plague of England. Comment It is interesting to compare this attitude to that of the later Plantagenet demigod, Richard II of England, who in the fourteenth century brutally suppressed the Peasant’s Revolt, and said to the survivors of his plague wrecked country: God omnipotent, is mustering in his clouds on our behalf, armies of pestilence and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot, that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 231 Appendix B: Book Abstracts Astronomical Revelations by Larry Brian Radka The author gives the name “Zion” to the planet that used to exist between Mars and Jupiter. It is possible that this planet was exceedingly bright like a star, even like unto the sun. Its luminosity may have come from the sun’s rays shining on its particular atmosphere. Its loss was recorded, but the phenomena and the subsequent symbolism associated with this planet was transferred to Jupiter as time went by. It is possible that this planet was also known as “Lucifer,” the “Son of the Morning,” implying that it was a ‘rival’ in majesty to the sun. The Planet Ceres Discovered orbiting the sun, in January 1, 1801, by Guiseppe Piazza. This is a fragment of the destroyed body that was between Mars and Jupiter. Later astronomers then discovered the asteroids, Pallas, Vesta, and Juno also existing in our solar sys- tem. Gustav Tschermak In 1875, one of the first astronomers to emphasize that these asteroids were part of a larger missing body. (See p. 14.)

(p. 18) Is the Earth an Asteroid There is mounting evidence that the life on Earth came to this location when Earth was itself a meteor- ite, ejected away from another cosmic body. This could explain why there is a deep connection to the stars, to the idea that our life began elsewhere in the Universe. (p. 20-21) “An alternative explanation is that the asteroid could have come from any one of the huge fragments left over from the planet that blew up in the asteroid belt.” (p. 22) Earth is not a Sphere Originally the planet had four distinct corners. “The slightly protruding corners make up the shape of a tetrahedron, which is not unlike the shape of many asteroids. The Earth would naturally have eventually rounded itself out after some time.

And, if it did this, why were there not similar holes excavated wherever there were ice sheets? (p. 69) The Irish and Christianity In recalling his researches on the comet that brought on the Dark Ages, Robert Stanley, the noted editor of Unicus magazine, related to us that they indicate “that the early Christian influence in Ireland was readily accepted because of the wide-spread, sky-born disaster that affected Europe, starting in 531 A.D. It caused the skies to be dark for years and brought on the fall of the Roman Empire. They stated that the Irish accepted the teachings of hell by the migrant missionary St. Patrick because they had already lived through a type of hell on Earth. (p. 110) The Age of Justinian “...the earth raged with uncommon violence during the reign of Justinian. Each year is marked by the repetition of earthquakes, such of duration, that Constantinople has been shaken above forty days; of such extent that the shock has been communicated to the whole surface of the globe, or at least the Roman Empire. An impulsive or vibratory motion was felt, enormous chasms were opened, huge and heavy bodies were discharged into the air, the sea alternatively advanced and retreated beyond its ordi- nary bounds, and a mountain was torn from Libanus, and cast into the waves...Two hundred and fifty thousand persons are said to have perished in the earthquake of Antioch, whose domestic multitudes were swelled by the conflux to the festival of Ascension.” (p. 113) Fatal Plagues The fatal disease which depopulated the earth in the time of Justinian and his successors, first appeared in the neighborhood of Pelusium, between the Serbonian bog and the eastern channel of the Nile. From thence, tracing as it were a double path, it spread to the East over Syria, Persia, and the Indies, and pen- etrated into the West along the coast of Africa, and over the continent of Europe. (p. 115) Dinosaurs It has been wondered why, if comet impact caused the extinction of the Dinosaurs, why did it not do the same for other contemporary creatures. It is therefore, conjectured that the comets that descended to earth were bringers of lethal infections from bacteria, but that only certain creatures would be suscepti- ble to the contagion. Halley’s comet is especially to the idea. “The visible decrease extended far beyond Justinian’s reign. It is clear through the Dark Ages, and the main cause seems to have been the multitude of celestial attacks heaved against the medieval genera- tions.” (p. 118) Annals of the Four Masters Many of these disturbances were seen in Ireland and are recorded in the Annals of Ulster.

(p. 272-3) The Biblical Deluge Could also have been caused or at least precipitated due to the impact of a watery comet. (p. 30) Such a comet would have had its icy content melted or vaporized, which would have saturated the air which could not hold water. The release would have created the rains spoken of in the Bible. Ancient Babylonian descriptions of the events leading up to the Flood, which are found in various cune- iform translations, seem to describe the Earthly arrival of this serpentine comet. (p. 260) Reduction of Lifespan While the average life before the Deluge extended for a period 912 years, after this great catastrophe it was reduced one-half, and we must admit the entrance of some great calamity must have produced this reduction in the length of life.

Knowing navigation, the Illi sailed the seas, the oceans, and the rivers. Up the rivers they went for trade, and later to settle in the high places, whence we get the word hill... Mountains were called the Cordirilla, or the ropes of the Illi. (p. 4) CASTLE – usually built on the sides of hills, by the Illi. CITADEL – literally, the city of the Illi.

Each U.S. city is connected in some way to a star, as are all the edifices in Washington, D.C.

Dominating this part of the skies would be the scorch- ing dog star, Sirius, a brilliant white and yellow star.

Such buildings were aligned with the stars, and with the spiritual beings who ruled the stars. (p. 124) Although a survey of the foundation charts used in the early phase of the building of Washington, D.C., reveals the importance of astrology, and, indeed, confirms beyond doubt that astrology played an impor- tant role in the early Masonic rites, the rationale of astrology was rarely discussed openly, even in Masonic documents. Knowledge of the stars- insofar as they were understood in Masonic circles—was preserved as secrets best left to those with specialist knowledge of such things.

To keep together so vast an empire, to assimilate under one government such heterogeneous populations as had recently been brought under its sway; to command the respect of distant kings; to curb the ambi- tion and repress the avarice of proconsuls who had become mightier than kings; and to preserve the pri- vate fortunes that had been carved out of the dying republic; some greater elements of power and authority and some more efficacious means of subordination were required to be wielded at Rome that those which had failed in the hands of Sylla and Pompey. (p. 27) The additional powers and discipline which for these reasons were needed to maintain the ascendancy of Rome were found in the peculiar organization and privileges of the Sacred college and in the myster- ies of religion. These the ambitious and unscrupulous Caesar hastened to seize with the office of high- priest and the assumption of sacerdotal powers, which, in proportion as they exceeded the attributes of earthly kings, rivaled those of gods. To this discipline and subordination was added that moral influence which the church alone could wield, the influence of blind faith, of religious myths and superstition, the respect for ecclesiastical displeasure, the fear of committing sacrilege, and the dread of excommunica- tion and anathema. These are elements of power and government which no statesman in any age, can afford to despise, and which we may feel assured were not permitted to lie unused by so profound a pol- itician as Julius Caesar.

Tiberius Refused to be deified as a god. Declaring himself to be mortal, he was upbraided. Augustus When the tremendous commotion caused by the death of Julius Caesar had spent itself in civil wars, and in the firm establishment of the Messianic religion and ritual, Augustus ascended the sacred throne of his martyred sire and was in turn addressed as the Son of God, whilst Julius was worshipped as the Father. The flamens of the Sacred college erected and consecrated to the worship of Julius Caesar a magnificent temple in Rome...they organized a body of priests called the Julii, or the Juliani. These priests were selected from the most ancient order, the Luperci... Luperci An ancient order of priests. Augustus Caesar The worship of Augustus was not, as the ecclesiastical schools have insinuated, a mere lip-service, a meaningless mode of saluting the sovereign-pontiff, an elusive form of adulation or flattery to the emperor of Rome; it was the worship of a personage who was believed to be a supernatural, omniscient, all-powerful and beneficent, the reincarnation of Quirinus, the Son of the god Apollo and of the wife- virgin Maia; the god whose coming was foretold by the Cumaen Sibyl; whose sway was to extend over the whole earth; whose conception and birth were both miraculous; and whose Advent was to usher in the Golden Age of Peace and Plenty and to banish Sin for ever. Such was his character in Rome. (p. 38) The months of the year were not named after such people for nothing. Ritual Sacrifices When Caesar was assassinated, Augustus was still in his teens...One of the first acts of Augustus was the destruction of Perugia, a city which refused to acknowledge his authority. The fall of this place was followed by the sacrificial placation of Julius the Father. In this atrocious rite...the consul, Lucius Anthony (brother of Marc), besides Cannutius C. Flavius, Clodius Bithynicus, and the principal magis- trates and council for Perugia, together with 300 senators and knights, were immolated as human sacri- fices, upon the altar of Julius, erected for the occasion.

(p. 47) The Expulsions The Church of Augustus tolerated no rivalry and permitted no heresies...The Egyptians and Jews in the city of Rome were ordered to renounce their impious worship or leave Italy at short notice. Four thou- sand of them were transported....The Chaldean astrologers, and afterwards all astrologers, magi, and worshippers of strange gods, were banished out of Italy. (p. 53) Claudius and Caligula Claudius and Caligula also insisted on being worshipped as actual gods. The Strange Separatism of the Emperors The deified Julius appears in his statues and coins covered with a veil. Augustus was repeatedly absent in the provinces, whence he returned to Rome in a secret manner. In the city he dwelt in a retired portion of his palace, a lofty chamber, which he called the Syracuse, and he commonly supped alone. (p. 81) Today we have the idea of the lofty chamber expressed in the architecture of the penthouse. “Pen” means the “head” or the “high place.” To the last, the emperors of Constantinople lived in seclusion, governed the empire by proxy, and were to be approached only with difficulty, mystery and the most servile homage.

The Rise of the “Alchemists” The rise of Alchemy (Magic) was not an accident or an event which happened simultaneously in Europe and elsewhere as part of the erstwhile movement of the times, as has been put before us by modern his- torians. Almost all of the so-called alumni of Alchemy were under royal patronage and were members of occult societies, such as the Rosicrucians and Masons. Many were instrumental in creating the educa- tional and governmental edifices which came into existence in the post Industrial epoch. A cursory observation of some of the details in the biographies of these magi reveals suggestive information wor- thy of deeper investigation. Of special note is the fact that almost all of them existed and operated between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries about the time when the portal to the “Macrobes” or “Cosmocraters” was opened by the Serpent Brotherhood. We forget that most of the pre-Industrial sci- entists were occultists and had written on astrology, demonology, and magic. Many were metallurgists. The quaint Medieval imagery of the sorcerer in his garret, the alchemist in his test-tube filled laboratory is a romantic smoke-screen behind which lies a very interesting tale that finally needs telling. The following were abstracted from Alchemy and Alchemists by Sean Martin: • Georgius Agricola (1494-1555) – An expert in mineralogy and metallurgy. • Henry Cornellius Agrippa (1486-1535) – Wrote De Occulta in 1510.

They are taking samples for laboratory research. Tracing the history of mankind across the world is difficult. This is especially true when trying to match legend and myth with actual archeological facts. But, when different cultures mix so do their genes. Unlike nuclear DNA mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from your mother. This makes tracing peo- ples history a little easier. However, one simple method of assessing relationships between cultures is their blood group. Various proteins in the blood have been named A and B. Some people have only one or the other (A and B groups), some people have both (AB) and some none (O group). There is also another protein called the Rhesus factor that some people have and others do not. If man is evolved from apes then there is something very strange since the AB group is almost non-existent in apes, and O is minimal! Chimpanzees are mainly group A (never B), and Gorillas are mainly group B (never A). Similarly, the early Europeans had a high percentage of group A, whilst the Asiatic races had a high per- centage of B. So the idea has been proposed that chimpanzees developed into Cro-Magnon man, then Europeans, whilst Gorillas developed into the larger brained Neanderthals then into the Asians. To account for group O, there must have been a third group of proto-humans who were O. For group O the Bororo, Mayans, and Incas are all virtually 100% group O. And the Navajos are 73% group O, whilst the Blackfoot Indians are 82% group A. As for group AB, which is rare, the Peking Chinese, Korean, Japanese show a good 10-18%, whilst the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarian Gypsies are close behind (9- 10%). But there are some exceptions to this in that the Tartars and Hindus show also strong AB. Whilst most groupings are generally split evenly, there are some astonishingly pure groupings. These must be accounted for in any history of man! One web page on Atlantis claims that the O blood group is the blood of royalty (blue blood) that stems from an Atlantean heritage. The races that possess this blood (called the Red races) are races of the Americas, of the Canary Islands, the Basques, Scandinavians, Celts, as well as certain Polynesian and Indonesian peoples.

The largest of these is the Fortress of Kuelap, built with 2.5 times as much stone as the Great Pyramid of Giza. One design commonly found in the ruins is remarkably similar to the Babylonian motif for a ship. Gene Savoy is certain that ships were navigated along the Amazon and were capable of reaching Europe and Asia. This indicates contact was likely between South America and cultures such as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians. So far, historians deny the possibility of the existence of a white, blue-eyed race in South America. But, in 1997 a cliff-top tomb was discovered in the cloud forest, bearing the typical red coloring and zigzag frieze of the chachapoya. A Peruvian archaeologist, Sonia Guilles, subsequently studied the tomb. Over 200 mummified bodies were found, bearing faces stitched onto the cloth. Like Egyptian mummies these had no internal organs and were embalmed, helping to preserve them from the high humidity of the cloud forest. The average height of the adult bodies was estimated to be 5 foot 10 inches, making them quite tall for ancient man.

The Saxons under him, called the time of this compilation of this record “Doomsday,” in respect of what was being lost to them for- ever.

The Americas have always been owned and governed by the same royal families of Britain and Europe that conventional history states as being among those defeated during the wars of so-called “Indepen- dence.” The United States, esoterically called “Amaraka” (land of the Serpents or land of the Phoenix), is now, and always has been, under the dominion of the Serpent Brotherhood, operating through the Russell Trust, the Freemasonic fraternities, and through the Government, Treasury, and Federal Reserve Board. All the American presidents can be seen standing on or walking on the red-carpet, the standard symbol of the monarchs. Moreover, as has now been revealed, they are all of direct kinship to the oligarchical, despotic dynasties of the “Old World Order.” All the provisos and bulwarks against this country falling into the hands of the “Black Nobility’s” financial monopolies, are null and void. Almost all Presidents who held the office have direct descendancy from European monarchs. The rea- son why this can be concealed, is due to the fact that all royal and aristocratic families have official and unofficial offspring, those they declare and those they do not. These latter are born in secret, sent to elite schools, told of their heritage in private, and groomed for various offices and posts. They turn up as heads of monopolies, world organizations, banks, schools, think-tanks, hospitals and even governments, posing as members of the ordinary sub-classes. It is partly due to this adroit strategy that nothing changes for the better in the world arena, despite all the well-meaning machinations and sacrifices. The cumulative changes are always in the favor of the controllers. Though the players seem from diverse backgrounds and affiliations, they all play a game of strict rules, as yet not seen by the masses. Those who come to learn the way the real “old boys network” is really run can either submit and succeed, or rebel and be made redundant. If royal genes have anything to do with electoral success, then Republican U.S. presidential candidate George W. Bush will be the next man in the White House, according to Britain’s blue blood “bible.” Burke’s Peerage, a respected guide to the breeding of the aristocracy, said that both Bush and his rival Al Gore are of royal descent, but investigations deep into their heritage show Bush has far more noble and royal connections. Bush is closely related to every European monarch on and off the throne—including the king of Alba- nia—and has kinship with every member of Britain’s royal family, the House of Windsor. He is the 13 th cousin of Britain’s Queen Mother, and of her daughter Queen Elizabeth, and is the 13 th cousin once removed of the heir to the throne, Prince Charles. Bush’s family tree can be documented as far back as the early 15 th century. He has a direct descent from Henry III and from Henry VIII’s sister Mary Tudor who was also the wife of Louis XI of France. He is also descended from Charles II of England. Never in the history of the United States have two presidential candidates been as well endowed with royal alliances, said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke’s Peerage. Brooks-Baker said there has always been a significant “royal factor,” in those who aspired to the White House, with Pres- idents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, among others, all boasting blue blood links. Al Gore...a descendant of Edward I, he is also a cousin of former U.S. President Richard Nixon, who resigned from the White House in 1974 for his part in the Watergate scandal. However, Al Gore does have direct links to the Holy Roman Empire. He is descendant of Roman Emperors Louis II, Charles II, and Louis I and is therefore also a direct descendant of Charlemagne, the eighth-century Emperor. The problem is that Gore’s Charlemagne links also make him a cousin of George W.

Most of the world's wealth is stored north of the north 33rd Parallel. Major financial cen- ters north of the 33rd Parallel include London, New York, Chicago, and Switzerland. Most of this planet's six billion people live south of the 33rd Parallel. Ironically, due to the power of the Masons and related power elites, the major publishers will rarely, if ever, publish books by any scholar who ventures into the forbidden issue of the Masons and power elites. When a major publisher does publish such a book, the result is censorship. For example, “Trag- edy and Hope,” written by a Professor Carroll Quigley, an exposé of the Bilderberger Group, was with- drawn by Macmillan, its publisher, within months of its publication. The Internet, talk radio, small presses, and underground publishers have kept information available to those who want to know the truth. James Shelby Downard (1913-1998) whose seminal essay, “Sorcery, Sex, Assassination and the Sci- ence of Symbolism” analyzed the 1963 President John F. Kennedy assassination in terms of geography, names, and symbols. Kennedy was shot while riding in the back of a limousine on Elm Street in Dallas, Texas, just south of the 33rd degree of latitude, the 33rd Parallel. The United States “Nightmare on Elm Street” happened when a trained assassin, not Lee Harvey Oswald, shot President Kennedy from a posi- tion in front of Kennedy. This assassination and the ensuing cover-up are significant because the victim was the most powerful man on earth, the President of the United States, and because the perpetrators have never been brought to justice. Significant though it was, the JFK assassination is only one among many calculated murders that have happened along, or close to, the 33rd Parallel. The number of murders of people of high position and key witnesses along the 33rd Parallel is significant. In addition, the three most well-known centers of paranormal activity are on or near the 33rd Parallel: Atlantis, the Great Pyramids, and the Bermuda Tri- angle. The number 33 is seen in different areas of life: The human foot has 33 muscles. The number of turns in a complete sequence of human DNA equals 33. The Holy Bible, New International Version, uses the word “thirty-three” seven times in seven verses. King David reigned in Jerusalem 33 years (2 Samuel 5:5, 1 Kings 2:11, 1 Kings 5:16, 1 Chronicles 3:4, and 1 Chronicles 29:27). Genesis 46:15 states: “These sons and daughters of his [Israel's or Jacob's] were thirty-three in all.”) Leviticus Chapter 12 dis- cusses purification after childbirth. Leviticus 12:4 states that after the boy is circumcised on the eighth day, “Then the woman must wait thirty-three days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary until her days of her purification are over.” Jesus Christ, having begun his three-year ministry at about the age of 30 (Luke 3:23), must have died on the cross and rose again at the age of 33. The Catholic Italian poet Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) divided his Divine Comedy into 100 Cantos: one Canto for the introduction, 33 Cantos for the Inferno, 33 Can- tos for the Purgatorio, and 33 Cantos for the Paradiso. Masons and their confederates may note that Dante placed the traitors to their guests in a deep pit of Hell in his 33rd Canto of the Inferno. The seduction of secret societies is as old as the Garden of Eden, when the serpent beguiled Eve, saying to her, “Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3:4-5).

Secret societies often “determine in the depths the changes that take place on the surface.” Arthur Edward Waite, quoted by A. Ralph Epperson, The Unseen Hand 126 (1985). Of all the secret societies in the world, the only one in which the number 33 is important is the secret cult of Freema- sonry, which mixes a brew of symbols from Egypt, the Bible, Persia, alchemy, and twisted occultists' imaginations. Freemasons are sworn to protect their brother Freemasons should they engage in immoral or criminal conduct. The royal arch mason swears, “I will aid and assist a companion royal arch mason, when engaged in any difficulty, and espouse his cause, so far as to extricate him from the same, if in my power, whether he be right or wrong. . . A companion royal arch mason's secrets, given me in charge as such, and I knowing him to be such, shall remain as secure and inviolable, in my breast as in his own, murder and treason not excepted.” Chronology of Significant Events at the Northern 33rd Degree of Latitude: 2589 B.C. to 1963 A.D. 1. 2589 - 2566 B.C . The Great Pyramid was built in Egypt by masons at a location not far south of 30 degrees latitude, and on 31 degrees longitude. How the Great Pyramid was built is unknown. Hero- dotus estimated that it would have taken 30 years and 100,000 slaves (slavemasons as opposed to Freemasons) to have built it. Another theory says that it was built by peasants who were unable to work the land while the Nile flooded between July and November. The flooded waters would have assisted in the transport of the stones, which were brought from Aswan and Tura and the water would have brought the stones right to the pyramid. It would have taken more than 2.3 million blocks of stone with an average weight of 2.5 tons each. The total weight would have been 6 million tons, the height, 482 feet. It is the largest and the oldest of the Pyramids of Giza. 2. 1470 B.C. (?) Atlantis destroyed? A continent was reputedly the size of Europe. It boasted gorgeous cities, advanced technology and utopian government. It suffered a cataclysm and was reduced to rubble that sank beneath the sea, lost forever. The legend of Atlantis has been around for thousands of years, and whatever its factual validity may be, it does claim a noble heritage, for its earliest known proponent was Plato. The Greek philosopher wrote of Atlantis in two of his dialogues, “Timaeus” and “Critias,” around 370 B.C. Plato said that this was a true story which derived from then-200-year-old records of the Greek ruler Solon, who heard of Atlantis from an Egyptian priest. Plato wrote that the continent lay in the Atlantic Ocean near the Straits of Gibraltar until its destruction 10,000 years before. In “Timaeus,” Plato described Atlantis as a prosperous nation out to expand its domain: “Now in this island of Atlantis there was a great and wonderful empire which had rule over the whole island and several others, and over parts of the continent,” he wrote, “and, furthermore, the men of Atlantis had subjected the parts of Libya within the columns of Heracles as far as Egypt, and of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia.” Plato then tells how the Atlanteans made a mistake by attacking Greece. They could not withstand the Greeks' military might, and following their defeat, a natural disaster sealed their fate. “Timaeus” continues: “But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea.” Plato tells a more metaphysical version of the"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Appendix C: Suggested Areas of Research 274 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Atlantis story in “Critias,” where he describes the lost continent as the kingdom of Poseidon, the god of the sea. This Atlantis was a noble, sophisticated society that reigned in peace for centuries, until its people became complacent and greedy. Angered by their fall from grace, Zeus chose to punish them by destroying Atlantis. Although Plato was the first to use the term “Atlantis,” there are ante- cedents to the legend. In an Egyptian legend which Solon probably heard while traveling in Egypt, and which was passed down to Plato years later, the island nation of Keftiu, home of one of the four pillars that held up the sky, was said to be a glorious advanced civilization which was destroyed and sank beneath the ocean. Another Atlantis-like story is closer to Plato's world, in terms of time and geography, and it is fac- tual. The Minoan Civilization was a great and peaceful culture based on the island of Crete, which reigned as long ago as 2200 B.C. The Minoan island of Santorini, later known as Thera, was home to a huge volcano. In 1470 B.C., it erupted with a force estimated to be greater than Krakatoa, and it destroyed everything on Santorini's surface. The resulting earthquakes and tsunamis devastated the rest of the Minoan Civilization, whose remnants were easily conquered by Greek forces. Santorini may have been the “real” Atlantis. Some have argued against this idea, noting Plato specified that Atlantis sank 10,000 years ago, but the Minoan disaster had taken place only 1,000 years earlier. Still, it could be that translation errors over the centuries changed Plato's original writing. Alterna- tively, Plato may have blurred the historical facts to suit his purposes. Or, Atlantis may be purely Plato's invention. Just the same, his story of the sunken continent has caught the imagination of suc- ceeding generations. Other Greek thinkers, such as Aristotle and Pliny, disputed the existence of Atlantis, while Plutarch and Herodotus wrote of it as historical fact. Atlantis became entrenched in folklore all around the world, charted on ocean maps and sought by explorers. In 1882, Ignatius Donnelly, a U.S. congressman from Minnesota, brought the legend into the Amer- ican consciousness with his book, Atlantis: The Antediluvian World . In more recent years, the psy- chic Edgar Cayce (1877-1945) became the U.S.'s most prominent advocate of a factual Atlantis. Widely known as “The Sleeping Prophet,” Cayce claimed the ability to see the future and to com- municate with long-dead spirits from the past. He identified hundreds of people—including him- self—as reincarnated Atlanteans. Cayce said that Atlantis had been situated near the Bermuda island of Bimini. He believed that Atlanteans possessed remarkable technologies, including supremely powerful “fire-crystals” which they harnessed for energy. A disaster in which the fire-crystals went out of control was responsible for Atlantis's sinking, he said, in what sounds like a cautionary fable on the dangers of nuclear power. Remaining active beneath the ocean waves, damaged fire-crystals emit energy fields that disrupt ships and aircraft—which is how Cayce accounted for the Bermuda Triangle. 3. 1704-1662 B.C. The Babylonian empire was based in Babylon, near the 33rd Parallel. The empire stretched from the Persian Gulf to the middle Euphrates River and upper Tigris River regions. Ham- murabi, the last great king of the first dynasty, developed his legal code and ordered it to be incised on a basalt column and placed in the temple of Shamash, the god of justice, for all to see. 4. 1500 B.C. Tel Megiddo: One of the most important archaeological mounds in Israel, Tel Megiddo has the remains of historic Megiddo, a fortified city that sat strategically on the ancient trunk road from Egypt to Syria and Mesopotamia. Near the 33rd Parallel, Tel Megiddo has served as an"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 275 Appendix C: Suggested Areas of Research important junction and battlefield throughout history. It is mentioned in an Egyptian document over 3,500 years old, was one of the chariot cities of Kings Solomon and Ahab, and was the site where Josiah, King of Judah, fell in battle. Excavations have uncovered the ruins of 25 cities dating from 4,000 to 400 B.C. Ruined structures, now visible, belong to the fortified “chariot city” built by King Solomon in the 10th century B.C. An ancient water system, dating from the 9th century B.C., is well preserved. It is a phenomenal piece of engineering which has a big shaft, sunk 120 feet through rock, meeting a tunnel cut more than 200 feet to a spring outside the city. The spring was hidden by a wall and camouflaged by a covering of earth. 5. 1025 - 945 B.C. Tyre, Lebanon: Home of King Hiram and the mythological Hiram Abiff, the Terri- ble Twosome of Masonic legend. Tyre is less than 20 miles north of the 33rd Parallel. Hiram was the King of Tyre in the reigns of David and Solomon. He was on friendly terms with both of them. King Hiram is first mentioned in the Holy Bible at 2 Samuel 5:11, almost at the start of his reign, when he sent messengers to David with cedar trees, carpenters and masons who built David a house. The wood was floated in rafts down the coast to Joppa, then brought overland to Jerusalem. Hiram, who admired David, sent an embassy to Solomon after David's death, as recorded in 1 Kings 5:1. Solomon took advantage of Hiram and arranged for Hiram to send him timber of cedar and fir from Lebanon. Hiram's “stone-squarers” (1 Kings 5:18) were men of Gebal (modern Jebail) north of Beirut. Both Solomon and Hiram were Semites. Solomon supplied Hiram with large quantities of wheat and olive oil annually for food (1 Kings 5:11), and he surrendered 20 “cities” of Galilee to Hiram (1 Kings 9:10-13). When Solomon had finished building the temple (seven years) and his palace (13 years), Hiram came to Galilee. Hiram was greatly dissatisfied when he saw the cities, and he nick- named them “Cabul,” a term of uncertain origin which Joseph in his Antiquities (8:5:3) says means “not pleasing” in the Phoenician tongue. Hiram and Solomon built a navy and equipped it with sailors on the Red Sea. They made expeditions from Ezion-geber at the head of the Gulf of Aqabah south to Ophir, where they purchased gold (1 Kings 9:28). They also had a “navy of Tarshish” on the Mediterranean which brought to them from afar “gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks” (1 Kings 10:22). No definite record has been found of Hiram's death. Hiram had a daughter who became one of Solomon's “seven hundred” wives (1 Kings 11:1, 3). A century later Ethbaal, who was Hiram's great grandson, was called “king of Sidon” in 1 Kings 16:31. Ethbaal's daughter, Jezebel, became Ahab's notorious queen (1 Kings 16:31). Renewed trou- bles after Ethbaal's death led to the emigration of Elissa, the Dido of Virgil's Aeneid IV, and to the foundation of Carthage. The Holy Bible does record a Hiram, a worker in brass. King Solomon brought this Hiram from Tyre to help build the temple (1 Kings 7:13, 14, 40-45; 2 Chronicles 2:13, 14; 4:11-16). This Hiram's mother was a woman of the tribe of Dan who had married first into the tribe of Naphtali, then later a man of Tyre. However, the name “Hiram Abiff” is nowhere in the Holy Bible. His name, and the myth surrounding his death and resurrection, are the product of occultists' imaginations."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Appendix C: Suggested Areas of Research 276 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation In the period from 587 B.C. to 581 B.C., the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel prophesied that Tyre would “become a spoil to the nations” (Ezekiel 26:5), a place to spread nets upon (26:14 and 47:10), and “built no more” (26:14). In 332 B.C., pursuant to Ezekiel's prophecy, Tyre fell to ruin when Alex- ander the Great besieged and stormed the city. 6. 875-848 B.C . The Biblical Mount Carmel is south of the modern city of Haifa and west of the Sea of Galilee in Israel. Mount Carmel is less than 20 miles south of the 33rd Parallel. At Carmel, Elijah the Hebrew prophet stood against 850 heathen prophets and defeated them (1 Kings 18). 7. 593-571 B.C . In Ezekiel Chapter 28, the prophet wrote while in exile in Babylon, not far south of the 33rd Parallel. Ezekiel wrote about the ruler of Tyre. Tyre is less than 20 miles north of the 33rd Parallel. The prophecy of Ezekiel called the king of Tyre wealthy and skilled in trading but proud and destined to destruction: {6} “'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “'Because you think you are wise, as wise as a god, {7} I am going to bring foreigners against you, the most ruth- less of nations; they will draw their swords against your beauty and wisdom and pierce your shining splendor. {8} They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas. {9} Will you then say, “I am a god,” in the presence of those who kill you? You will be but a man, not a god, in the hands of those who slay you. {10} You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. Ezekiel continues by comparing the king of Tyre to the fallen angel, Satan: “You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones. {15} You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you. {16} Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, O guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones. {17} Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings. {18} By your many sins and dishonest trade you have dese- crated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching. {19} All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.” 8. 605-562 B.C. Babylon was the predominant city in the ancient world during the reign of Nebuchad- nezzar II. 9. Circa 29 A.D. At Caesarea Philippi, near the 33rd Parallel, Jesus Christ predicted his own death (Matthew 16:22). 10. 1492 As the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria sailed through the Bermuda Triangle in 1492, Columbus's compass went haywire and that he and his crew saw weird lights in the sky. This could have been a Bermuda Triangle paranormal event or a sign from God. These events, however, have mundane explanations. Columbus's compass's slight inaccuracy may have stemmed from nothing more than the discrepancy between true north and magnetic north. As for the lights, Columbus wrote of seeing “a great flame of fire” that crashed into the ocean -- probably a meteor. He saw lights in the sky again on October 11-- the day before his famous landing. The lights, brief flashes near the hori- zon, were spotted in the area where dry land turned out to be. Although there are rational"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 277 Appendix C: Suggested Areas of Research explanations for what Columbus saw, his experience has contributed to the legend of the Bermuda Triangle, the huge three-sided segment of the Atlantic Ocean bordered by Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 11. 1500s In Spain (33rd Parallel), renegade Jesuits and Franciscans took the name Alumbrados (Enlightened). They believed in direct contact between the human soul and the Holy Spirit, which prompted the Inquisition to issue three edicts against the group. 12. 1756 Charleston, South Carolina, the original site of Scottish Rite Masonry in the United States, is only 15 miles south of the 33rd Parallel. 13. 1826 Masons murdered Masonic whistle blower Captain William Morgan. Captain Morgan was an American Freemason who wrote a book revealing Masonic secrets, “Illustrations of Freemasonry.” One revealed secret was that the last mystery at the top of the Masonic pyramid is the worship of Lucifer, that is, Satan. In the legend of the murder of Hiram Abiff, Abiff represents intelligence, lib- erty and truth, and was struck down by a blow to the neck with a rule, representing the suppression of speech by the church. Then a square struck him in the heart. This represented the State's suppres- sion of belief. Last, a maul struck him on the head. This represented the suppression of intellect by the masses. So, Freemasonry equates the Church, the State, and the masses with tyranny, intoler- ance, and ignorance. What Morgan revealed was that the Freemasons were pledged to avenge Hiram Abiff and that their plan was to strike down the Church, the State, and the freedom of the masses. Captain Morgan caused a small uproar against the Masons which culminated in a vital anti-Freema- son movement causing nearly 40% of Masons belonging to the Northern Jurisdiction of the United States to secede and, in 1829, gave birth to an anti-Masonic political party when the author, William Morgan disappeared. He was apparently abducted and drowned in Lake Ontario, allegedly by his fellow Mason Richard Howard. 14. 1861 On April 12, Confederate forces fired on the Union's Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, igniting the Civil War. Charleston, at the 33rd Parallel, is known officially as “the Mother Lodge of the World.” This Lodge had been founded by Moses Lindo as the King Solomon Lodge. 15. 1933 Late in the pre-inaugural banking crisis, on March 3, 1933 (3/03/33), the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Reserve Bank's Governor Harrison had agreed that the Board would issue an order closing all the Federal Reserve Banks. New York Governor Herbert Lehman, at the urging of Governor Harrison, also agreed to proclaim an emergency bank holiday in New York, and a simi- lar action was taken in Illinois. One of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first official acts after taking office on Inauguration Day (Saturday, March 4, 1933), was to proclaim an emergency, three-day, nationwide banking holiday, signed and effective Monday, March 6. FDR was a member of the Ancient Arabic Order Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, i.e., the Shriners. Shriners are 33rd degree Masons. The Great Seal of United States was established on June 20, 1782. The back of the Great Seal was barely known until the 1930s when it became a part of the dollar bill under Masonic United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt. On the reverse side of the Great Seal are an eye and a pyramid. Over the eye and pyramid is an inscription, “Annuit Coeptis,” Latin for “He favors our undertak- ings.” “Undertaking” means a venture, a promise, of the profession or duties of a funeral director. The Masons would like to believe that God favors their duties as funeral directors. The Masons"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Appendix C: Suggested Areas of Research 278 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation become funeral directors by first directing whose body will be at the funeral, and where that life will be taken. If a life is taken close to the northern 33rd Parallel, this fits with the Masons' demonic mythology in which they demonstrate their worldly power by spilling human blood at a predeter- mined locale. The inscription below the pyramid is “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” Latin for “The New Order of the Ages.” Taking the first and last letters of each inscription, and the first letter of the middle word, “Ordo,” in the second inscription, the letter are M-A-S-O-N. Masons, in the original sense of the word as builders and stonemasons, built the Great Pyramid. The eye of the pyramid on the Great Seal is “the eye of god,” which “watches and pierces the heart. Who knows its name? Call it love, creation, conspiracy,” says the Egyptian Book of Coming Forth by Day, better known as the Egyptian Book of the Dead. The death theme continues with the pyra- mid itself. The Greek origin of the word “pyramid” derives from fire-especially “funeral pyre.” The King's Burial Chamber is found in the center of the Great Pyramid. For the Great Pyramid func- tioned as a giant tomb for the Pharaoh. 16. 1945 Near the end of World War II, on April 12, 1945, President Franklin D. Roosevelt met his “sudden death” of a cerebral hemorrhage at the 33rd Parallel at Warm Springs, Georgia. His last words were, “I have a terrific headache.” His medical chart is missing. 17. 1945 Roosevelt's successor was Harry S. Truman. “I've got every degree in the Masons that there is,” said Truman. Harry S. Truman often told journalists, “The S doesn't stand for anything.” How- ever, after he attained the 33rd degree as a Mason, Truman secretly changed his name by adding the middle initial “S,” which stood for Solomon. Truman's rise as a politician is traceable to Masonic sponsorship. He said that being Grand Master for the whole state of Missouri helped him win a U.S. Senate Seat in 1940. Truman's sister, Mary Jane Truman, was the Grand Matron of Missouri in the Order of the Eastern Star, a Masonic organization. As the 33rd President, this 33rd degree Mason initiated the Nuclear Age, the crowning success of alchemy, when the first A-bomb exploded at the 33rd Parallel Trinity Test Site, (Alamogordo) White Sands, New Mexico, at the 33rd Parallel. He was responsible for killing of thousands of Japanese (the Yellow Peril) at two cities close to the 33rd Parallel, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On August 6, 1945 at 8:15 a.m. United States B-29 bomber Enola Gay, on Mission No. 13, dropped an atomic bomb called “Little Boy” on Hiroshima, Japan near the 33rd Parallel. This was “Day One” of a new age, the Nuclear Age. To understand the change that took place, we must back up and look at the importance of the number 13 from the formation of the United States to the atomic bomb's explosion in Hiroshima. In 1935, Paul Foster Case wrote: “Since the date, 1776, is placed on the bottom course of the pyra- mid [on the Great Seal], and since the number 13 has been so important in the history of the United States and in the symbols of the seal, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the thirteen courses of the pyramid may represent thirteen time-periods of thirteen years each.” The 13 time-periods of 13 years each equaled 169 years. From July 4, 1776 to July 4, 1945 equaled 169 years. From July 4, 1945 to August 6, 1945 (Hiroshima) was 33 days."},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 279 Appendix C: Suggested Areas of Research 18. 1946 On August 19, 1946, Bill Clinton, the 42nd President, was born in Hope, Arkansas, at the 33rd Parallel. His parentage is disputed. As a young man, Bill Clinton was a Master Counselor of the Masonic-connected Demolay. (“Demolay” derives from the Grand Master of the Knights Templar, James deMolay (1244-1314)). Clinton's ties with the C.I.A. began when he studied at Oxford. Clin- ton's reign as President has been noted for numerous scandals, including the unexplained deaths of more than 50 of his associates by means of bullets and plane crashes. 19. 1947 On July 8, 1947, a UFO and aliens' bodies were allegedly found in the desert outside Roswell, New Mexico, at the 33rd Parallel. 20. 1947 On July 26, 1947, while aboard the presidential aircraft “Sacred Cow,” Masonic United States President Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947. The Act created an independent Air Force, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency. The National Security State was born. 21. 1947 On December 5, 1947, the disappearance of Flight 19 spurred on the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. Five Navy Avenger bombers vanished while on a routine training mission, as did a rescue plane sent to search for them—six aircraft and 27 men, gone without a trace. Or so the story goes. When all the facts are laid out, the tale of Flight 19 becomes far less puzzling. All of the crewmen of the five Avengers were inexperienced trainees, with the exception of their patrol leader, Lt. Charles Taylor. Taylor was perhaps not at the height of his abilities that day, as some reports indicate that he had a hangover and failed in his attempts to pass off this flight duty to someone else. A search party was dispatched, which included the Martin Mariner that many claim disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle along with Flight 19. While it is true that it never returned, the Mariner did not vanish. Twenty-three seconds after takeoff, it exploded in the sight of several witnesses at the base. Unfortunately, this was not an uncommon occurrence, because Mariners were known for their faulty gas tanks. No known wreckage from Flight 19 has ever been recovered. One reasonable explanation is that Taylor led the planes so far into the Atlantic that they were past the continental shelf. There the ocean abruptly drops from a few hundred feet deep to several thousand feet deep. Planes and ships that sink to such depths are seldom seen again. The deepest point in the Atlantic Ocean, the 30,100-foot-deep Puerto Rico Trench, lies within the Bermuda Triangle. Combining the circumstances of the failing compass, the difficulty of radio transmissions, and the absence of wreckage, tales of mysterious intervention befalling Flight 19 began to take form. Theo- ries involving strange magnetic fields, time warps, Atlantis, and alien abduction began to appear. Even an official Navy report intimated that the Avengers had disappeared “as if they had flown to Mars.” The lost aviators reappeared from a spaceship at Devil's Tower National Monument in Steven Spielberg's 1977 movie, “Close Encounters of the Third Kind.” 22. 1948 During the Israeli War of Independence, the Israelis overcame invading Arabs forces at Mish- mar Haemek. The reunification of the Jews had been prophesied by Ezekiel in Chapter 28, the same chapter which told of the fall of the King of Tyre. The Kennedy Assassination 23. 1963 John Fitzgerald Kennedy was shot from the front and killed in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas near the 33rd Parallel on 11/22/63 (11 + 22 = 33). Dealey Plaza is the site of the first Masonic temple"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Appendix C: Suggested Areas of Research 280 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation in Dallas. The Masons who co-coordinated the assassination were traitors to their guest, United States President John F. Kennedy. An article in the Realist, 1991, suggests that George Bush was taped in a telephone conversation with [Masons] Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, Allen Dulles, and Nelson Rockefeller, in which the parties discussed the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Some Masons who were involved in the cover-up of the Kennedy assassination are as follows: Johnson had received the Entered Apprentice Degree in Johnson City Lodge No. 561, Texas, on October 30, 1937. Johnson, as next in line for the Presidency, was the most direct beneficiary of JFK's death. He was a Mason who hated JFK, a Catholic. One of Johnson's first acts as President was to call the Dallas Police to order them to stop the investigation because they had their man, Oswald. This was an illegal order because the President has no authority to tell city police how to conduct a homicide investigation. President Johnson also ordered the Federal Bureau of Investiga- tion to check every aspect of the assassination. This was a whitewash. The F.B.I. was headed by J. Edgar Hoover, who had become a member of Federal Lodge No. 1, District of Columbia, on November 9, 1920. The public wanted more answers concerning the murder of the President than the Masonic-con- trolled F.B.I. could provide. So, on November 29, 1963, President Johnson issued an executive order creating the Warren Commission, named after the man President Johnson had chosen to lead it, United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren. Warren, a Past Grand Master of Masons in California, was joined on the Commission by two other known Freemasons: Senator Richard B. Russell, a member of Winder Lodge No. 33, Georgia, and Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michi- gan. John Sherman Cooper, Hale Boggs, Allen W. Dulles, and John J. McCloy were the others on the Commission. Allen W. Dulles had been Director of the C.I.A. until JFK fired him. Louisiana Democratic Congressman Hale Boggs, who later publicly expressed doubts about the Warren Com- mission Report, disappeared in a plane between Anchorage and Juneau, Alaska on October 16, 1972. Masons representing many interests may have conferred and reached a consensus on Kennedy's fate, as occurred in the Morgan case in 1826, each knowing their discussions would be held in confi- dence. Their motives would probably be to protect and advance business interests and their social positions. These would include: • Taking the presidency for Freemason Lyndon B. Johnson, • Protecting Freemason J. Edgar Hoover's control of the F.B.I. • Eliminating Kennedy's softening position on communism, a threat to a wide variety of American business interests overseas. • Slowing the progress of the civil rights movement, an irritation to the KKK and other racists. • Eliminating Kennedy's challenges to the CIA's leadership; he'd fired CIA Director Allen Dulles (a Warren Commission member) and Deputy Director Charles Cabell. Another motive was a violent reaction to Catholicism. At that time, Kennedy's Church, Catholicism, condemned membership in Freemasonry “under pain of excommunication.” The Warren Commission accomplished its mission to cover up the truth. It concluded that Lee Har- vey Oswald acted alone in killing JFK in 1963. The name Oswald is used by Shakespeare and the Beatles."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 281 Appendix C: Suggested Areas of Research In “I Am the Walrus,” released on November 27, 1967 by the Beatles, John Lennon played a BBC production of Shakespeare's King Lear Act IV, Scene 6, lines 249-259 in the background of the song. The lines are as follows: Oswald: Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body And give the letters which you find'st about me To Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out Upon the English party. O, untimely death! Death! [He dies] Edgar: I know thee well: a serviceable villain, As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire. Gloucester: What, is he dead? Edgar: Sit you down, father. Rest you. [Gloucester sits.] Oswald was a “serviceable villain” to the Masonic plotters who covered their tracks by setting him up as the patsy. In King Lear, Oswald was duteous to the vices of his mistress, the treasonous daugh- ter Goneril. In JFK's assassination, Oswald was duteous to the vices of his mistress, the treasonous Masons in the F.B.I., an organization which destroyed his last communication to it and ordered him to the theater where he was arrested. A Masonic conspiracy provides historical precedents for the assassination, provides an existing organizational structure capable of covering-up the crime, explains the absence of internal records, and provides many potential motives. The bigger issue, one that must still be answered, was asked in an American Anti-Masonic pamphlet published in 1829 and holds true for today: Ought a secret society exist amongst us whose members can commit murder and yet escape punish- ment? MASONS HAVE done this, and their brethren . . . are sworn to protect them. Fellow citizens, are men bound by such obligations and possessing such principals, FIT to be rulers of a FREE PEO- PLE? The Kennedy assassination appears to have been part a campaign of assassinations against a genera- tion of leaders who posed challenges to the entrenched power structure. The death toll included John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X. Viewed as a whole, these assassinations lead to the conclusion that anyone who promotes serious social reforms geared toward sharing the wealth and power will not be tolerated in a leadership position. Kennedy was planning to withdraw from Vietnam “by the end of 1965.\" Shortly after JFK's death, Freemason Lyndon Johnson reversed Kennedy's policy toward Vietnam. The escalating involvement in the Vietnam conflict was driven by the Freemasons who solidified their control of the United States government after the assassination of President Kennedy.

Chronology of Significant Events at the Northern 33rd Degree of Latitude: 1964 A.D. to the Future 24. 1968 On June 5, 1968, shortly after winning the California primary election, U. S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California, close to the 33rd Parallel and near a Masonic Lodge. This was a sophisticated assassination plot. Two groups were co-coordi- nated to kill the Senator. Two people shot at Senator Kennedy, a Mafia hit man and a Manchurian candidate. Also involved was Khaiber Khan, an Iranian secret agent who had assisted the C.I.A. with the 1953 coup in Iran. Khaiber Khan had powerful ties to British Intelligence. The cover-up involved CIA agents in the LAPD, police destruction of evidence, police badgering of witnesses, and perjury by a police criminalist. The Mason-controlled major media has ignored the overwhelming evidence that two guns were fired in the pantry where Senator Kennedy was killed, and that Sirhan Sirhan could not have fired the fatal bullet into Kennedy's head. To draw attention away from the Kennedys, J. Edgar Hoover, the Masonic drag queen F.B.I. Director, waited until the day of the RFK funeral to announce that James Earl Ray, the Mason's patsy for the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., had been arrested in England. 25. 1990 Mason/Skull and Bones member George Bush, the 41st United States President, provoked a war with Saddam Hussein. On July 25, 1990, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, told Hussein that the Iraq/Kuwait dispute was an Arab matter, not one that affects the United States. On August 2, 1990, believing that the United States' Ambassador's word meant something, Hussein invaded Kuwait. In “retaliation” for the invasion he had orchestrated through his Ambassador, Mason George Bush organized Desert Storm, which concerned a border dispute between Kuwait and Iraq at the 33rd Parallel. Shortly after Desert Storm began, Mason George Bush pronounced that this the beginning of a “New World Order.” 26. 1991 January: During his State of the Union message during the Gulf War, President George Bush stated: “What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea - a new world order. . . to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind. . . based upon shared principles and the rule of law. . . .

On April 19, 1993, the Clinton Administration murdered adults and children in the Branch Davidian group at Mount Carmel, a compound about 10 miles from the city of Waco. 28. 1997 While still shooting “Titanic,” Director James Cameron secretly traveled to Arizona to become a 32nd Degree Mason at the Masonic lodge in downtown Phoenix, on March 13th, 1997. While Cameron was receiving his initiation into the 32nd degree from his Law of One allies, millions of people witnessed a large V-shaped formation of “lights” over the city of Phoenix. Phoenix is just north of 33? North Latitude. Its ancient name was “Fenex.” As historical reminders, many sites sacred to the Law of One are located in the vicinity of 33° including the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, which are patterned after the belt stars of “Orion.”"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 283 Appendix C: Suggested Areas of Research 29. 1998 Director James Cameron was inducted as a 33rd Degree Freemason at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles with an informal ceremony. Cameron's induction took place in a small room inside the Shrine while celebrities and movie stars were filing inside for the March 23, 1998, Academy Awards. Later, on his birthday Cameron formally became a 33rd Degree Freemason in the Supreme Council 33rd Degree Temple in Washington, D.C. Cameron is a leading “light” for the military- industrial-Hollywood complex, formerly the “military-industrial complex,” which President Eisen- hower had warned against in his 1961 Farewell Address. 30. 1998 On November 5, 1998, the movie “Titanic” began playing in Houston, Texas. The special showing debuted Theatre Vision technology. Houston is south of the 30th degree of north latitude. However, the beginning time of the showing is significant: it began playing at 3:33 p.m. At least two attendees were 33rd degree Masons: Director Cameron and former President George Bush. Bush was a member of the secret society “Skull and Bones” when at Yale. A former director of the CIA, he is in the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. After Bush took over the CIA in 1974, having been appointed by 33rd degree Mason President Gerald Ford, he destroyed or hid MK-ULTRA (CIA mind-control) projects. The Theatre Vision technology may be a new genera- tion of MK-ULTRA mind-control. Bush is alleged to have been involved in the smuggling of drugs from Central America to the U.S. in the 1980s and when President, he publicly uttered the words “New World Order” in front of the entire world. 31. 1999 In Columbiana, Alabama, on August 5, 1999, Alan Eugene Miller allegedly killed two co- workers and also a third person where Miller used to work. Columbiana, near Birmingham and Fort McClellan, is barely north of the 33rd Parallel. Sources said that under questioning, Miller told authorities he did not remember going to the murder scenes or anything else about the killings—a statement characteristic of a Manchurian candidate. 32. Soon? In the New Testament book of Revelation, Megiddo is identified as the site of the last great battle of the world, Armageddon, a corruption of the Hebrew “Har Megiddo.” Revelation 16:16 (NIV) states: “Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armaged- don.” Conclusion The Masons have infiltrated the highest levels of government, business, and media. The astute viewer of world events should watch for significant events to occur on the 33rd Parallel. It is a safe bet that the truth and what the controlled media present as the facts will become further and further apart. A revival of the Anti-Masonic movement in the United States, such as the small movement that has begun in Great Britain, would benefit all law-abiding Americans.

Strange Forces in Outer Space Mysterious Force Holds Back NASA Probe in Deep Space by Robert Matthews, Science Correspondent A SPACE probe launched 30 years ago has come under the influence of a force that has baffled scien- tists and could rewrite the laws of physics. Researchers say Pioneer 10, which took the first close-up pictures of Jupiter before leaving our solar system in 1983, is being pulled back to the Sun by an unknown force. The effect shows no sign of get- ting weaker as the spacecraft travels deeper into space, and scientists are considering the possibility that the probe has revealed a new force of nature. Dr. Philip Laing, a member of the research team tracking the craft, said: “We have examined every mechanism and theory we can think of and so far nothing works. “If the effect is real, it will have a big impact on cosmology and spacecraft navigation,” said Dr. Laing, of the Aerospace Corporation of California. Pioneer 10 was launched by NASA on March 2 1972, and with Pioneer 11, its twin, revolutionized astronomy with detailed images of Jupiter and Saturn. In June 1983, Pioneer 10 passed Pluto, the most distant planet in our solar system."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Appendix C: Suggested Areas of Research 286 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Both probes are now travelling at 27,000 m.p.h. towards stars that they will encounter several million years from now. Scientists are continuing to monitor signals from Pioneer 10, which is more than seven billion miles from Earth. Research to be published shortly in The Physical Review, a leading physics journal, will show that the speed of the two probes is being changed by about 6 m.p.h. per century—a barely-perceptible effect about 10 billion times weaker than gravity. Scientists initially suspected that gas escaping from tiny rocket motors aboard the probes, or heat leak- ing from their nuclear power plants might be responsible. Both have now been ruled out. The team says no current theories explain why the force stays constant: all the most plausible forces, from gravity to the effect of solar radiation, decrease rapidly with distance. The bizarre behavior has also eliminated the possibility that the two probes are being affected by the gravitational pull of unknown planets beyond the solar system. Assertions by some scientists that the force is due to a quirk in the Pioneer probes have also been dis- counted by the discovery that the effect seems to be affecting Galileo and Ulysses, two other space probes still in the solar system. Data from these two probes suggests the force is of the same strength as that found for the Pioneers. Dr. Duncan Steel, a space scientist at Salford University, says even such a weak force could have huge effects on a cosmic scale. “It might alter the number of comets that come towards us over millions of years, which would have consequences for life on Earth. It also raises the question of whether we know enough about the law of gravity.” Until 1988, Pioneer 10 was the most remote object made by man—a distinction now held by Voyager 1. Should Pioneer 10 make contact with alien life, it carries a gold-plated aluminum plaque on which the figures of a man and woman are shown to scale, along with a map showing its origin that NASA calls “the cosmic equivalent of a message in a bottle.”"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 287 Appendix D: Scientific Evidence Bacteria from Space (Panspermia) An international team of scientists has recovered microorganisms in the upper reaches of the atmo- sphere that could have originated from outer space...The living bacteria, plucked from an altitude of 10 miles or higher by a scientific balloon, could have been deposited in terrestrial airspace by a passing comet, according to the researchers.

(Abstracted from p. 5, Psychic Reader, April 2000) Comment The bacteria could easily have originated on Earth, rising into the high atmosphere after any one of the major cataclysms that have occurred here. But more likely and probably the reason why things have be kept “under wraps” is that the bacteria originated on Tiamat (Lucifer, Phaeton) the planet that was destroyed by atomic weaponry and whose remains now make up the so-called asteroid belt and whose debris has continually fallen into earth atmosphere and onto the very sur- face, as Charles Fort and others have researched for decades. Scientists Find 'Lost City' of Ancient Rock Now researchers probing the ocean bottom have found 18-story-high towers of stone - the tallest ever - near a section of volcanic fault ridges that extend for 6,200 miles along the Atlantic Ocean floor. Inspired by the formations' majestic heights and by the fact that the stone towers appear on a sea-floor mountain named Atlantis Massif, the scientists named the field of about two dozen stone structures the Lost City in honor of the fabled, flooded city. Not only are the underwater stone spirals unusual in composition and their location, scientists think they may offer a glimpse into Earth's earliest environments when life began and may possibly host new life forms. “It was clear these were unlike anything we'd ever seen before,” says Deborah Kelley, an oceanographer at the University of Washington and one of three people who traveled to the newly discovered under- world in a submersible vessel."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Appendix D: Scientific Evidence 288 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation A Mountain With Fingers Scientists have found about 100 other underwater vent systems made up of clusters of mineral deposits around volcanic cracks in the ocean floor. Colonies of strange, primitive creatures, including blood-red tubeworms and large clams feed on nutrients leached by hot, dissolving gas from the vents. But this network of stone is unique. Rather than forming directly around volcanic vents, the formations are about 9 miles from the cracks. The towers extend like groping fingers above Atlantis Massif, a sub- merged mountain about the size of Washington's Mt. Ranier. As Jeff Karson, an oceanographer who explored the Lost City with Kelley remarked, “If this were on land, this would be a national park.” The Lost City is also strikingly bright–or as bright as things can appear under artificial light a half-mile below sea level. While rock formations around volcanic ridges normally appear black, these formations are gleaming white because they are made up of materials similar to pale concrete, such as carbonate minerals and silica. Kelley, who was lead author of a study about the formations in this week's issue of the journal, Nature , says the steep-sided towers of rock blossom into feathery ledges of precipitated stone which sprawl outwards for as wide as 30 feet. Most unusual about the structures are their size. The highest stone spiral reaches 180 feet above the ocean floor. Before finding Lost City, the highest known underwater structure was an 80-foot-high stone chimney known as “Godzilla” on the seafloor off the Washington state coast. “Godzilla” cracked in half and toppled to the sea floor three years ago. Heat From a Green Rock Part of the reason Lost City's sea-scrapers could grow so high is because they're located 9 miles away from the volcanic vents of the Mid Atlantic Ridge. This distance buffers the rocks from volcanic erup- tions that occur once every 5-10 years at the ridge's axis and from earthquake activity that's more fre- quent around the vents. But the structures' distance from the underwater vents also suggests the towers must be formed by a unique process. In so-called “black smoker” formations, ocean water sloshes near hot magma at the volcanic vents and then heats up to 750 degrees Fahrenheit. The hot water absorbs minerals and chemicals from surrounding rocks and eventually flows upwards. As the hot water rises it cools and releases the minerals and chemicals, which form towers of dark mineral rock and nutrient- rich ecosystems. At Lost City, the construction of the stone towers appears to be driven not by hot magma, but by a rare rock. In this region, sections of a glassy green rock known as olivine are exposed directly under small cracks in the ocean floor. When ocean water seeps into this 1.5-million-year-old mantel rock, it reacts with the olivine to form a scaly, dull green rock known as Serpentine. This reaction generates heat, which triggers the same building of mineral deposits as seen at black smokers. But these deposits are made of a different, paler rock. “The fluids coming out of these cracks at Lost City have not been found before,” says Karen Von Damm of the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and Space at the University of New Hampshire. “So it's likely there's also new life there that hasn't been found before.” By “new” life, Von Damm means undiscovered life, and this life might in fact be very ancient. Some believe any life around the chalky towers of Lost City could resemble Earth's earliest life forms."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 289 Appendix D: Scientific Evidence Lost City Like Earliest Earth? Unusual life forms called Archaea have been found around traditional oceanic vent systems and these animals have been placed near the bottom of the evolutionary scale. Scientists believe life around Lost City might be even more primitive. Animals around Lost City would be living in temperatures a little more similar to Earth's suspected early climate –around 160 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with the even more scorching temperature at hydrothermal vents. The new vents also have high pH levels - or low acidity - which some have pro- posed was also present when life began on the planet. Finally, the site produces high levels of methane, which the most ancient forms of bacteria are thought to have feasted on billions of years ago. “The area conjures up the origins of life,” says Richard Lutz, an oceanographer at Rutgers University who was among the first oceanographers to explore the first hydrothermal vent system ever discovered in the late 1970s. “There's a good case that this could have been the kind of environment where life began.” Egyptian Artifacts in the Grand Canyon The Phoenix Gazette - April 5, 1909 Remarkable Finds Indicate Ancient People Migrated From Orient The latest news of the progress of the explorations or what is now regarded by scientists as not only the oldest archaeological discovery in the United States, but one of the most valuable in the world, which was mentioned some time ago in the Gazette (see photo at left), was brought to the city yesterday by G.E. Kinkaid, the explorer who found the great underground citadel of the Grand Canyon during a trip from Green River, Wyoming, down the Colorado, in a wooden boat, to Yuma, several months ago. According to the story related to the Gazette by Mr. Kinkaid, the archaeologists of the Smithsonian Institute, which is financing the expeditions, have made discoveries which almost conclusively prove that the race which inhabited this mysterious cavern, hewn in solid rock by human hands, was of orien- tal origin, possibly from Egypt, tracing back to Ramses. If their theories are borne out by the translation of the tablets engraved with hieroglyphics, the mystery of the prehistoric peoples of North America, their ancient arts, who they were and whence they came will be solved. Egypt and the Nile, and Arizona and the Colorado will be linked by a historical chain running back to ages, which staggers the wildest fancy of the fictionist. Under the direction of Professor S. A. Jordan, the Smithsonian Institute is now prosecuting the most thorough explorations, which will be continued until the last link in the chain is forged. Nearly a mile underground, about 1480 feet below the surface, the long main passage has been delved into, to find another mammoth chamber from which radiates scores of passageways, like the spokes of a wheel. Several hundred rooms have been discovered, reached by passageways running from the main passage, one of them having been explored are 854 feet and another 634 feet. The recent finds include articles, which have never been known as native to this country and doubtless they had their origin in the orient. War weapons, copper instruments, sharp-edged and hard as steel, indicate the high state of civilization reached by these strange people. So interested have the scientists become that preparations are being made to equip the camp for extensive studies, and the force will be increased to thirty or forty persons. “Before going further into the cavern, better facilities for lighting will have to be installed, for the dark- ness is dense and quite impenetrable for the average flashlight. In order to avoid being lost, wires are being strung from the entrance to all passageways leading directly to large chambers. How far this cav-"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Appendix D: Scientific Evidence 290 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation ern extends no one can guess, but it is now the belief of many that what has already been explored is merely the “barracks”, to use an American term, for the soldiers, and that far into the underworld will be found the main communal dwellings of the families. The perfect ventilation of the cavern, the steady draught that blows through, indicates that it has another outlet to the surface.” Mr. Kinkaid was the first white child born in Idaho and has been an explorer and hunter all his life, thirty years having been in the service of the Smithsonian Institute. Even briefly recounted, his history sounds fabulous, almost grotesque: “First, I would impress that the cavern is nearly inaccessible. The entrance is 1,486 feet down the sheer canyon wall. It is located on government land and no visitor will be allowed there under penalty of tres- pass.” The scientist's wish to work unmolested, without fear of the archaeological discoveries being disturbed by curio or relic hunters. A trip there would be fruitless, and the visitor would be sent on his way. “The story of how I found the cavern has been related, but in a paragraph: I was journeying down the Colorado River in a boat, alone, looking for minerals. Some forty two miles up the river from the El Tovar Crystal canyon, I saw on the east wall, stains in the sedimentary formation about 2,000 feet above the river bed. There was no trail to this point, but I finally reached it with great difficulty. Above a shelf, which hid it from view from the river, was the mouth of the cave.” “There are steps leading from this entrance some thirty yards to what was, at the time the cavern was inhabited, the level of the river. When I saw the chisel marks on the wall inside the entrance, I became interested, securing my gun and went in.” “During that trip, I went back several hundred feet along the main passage till I came to the crypt in which I discovered the mummies. One of these I stood up and photographed by flashlight. I gathered a number of relics, which I carried down the Colorado to Yuma, from whence I shipped them to Washing- ton with details of the discovery. Following this, the explorations were undertaken.” “The main passageway is about 12 feet wide, narrowing to nine feet toward the farther end. About 57 feet from the entrance, the first side-passages branch off to the right and left, along which, on both sides, are a number of rooms about the size of ordinary living rooms of today, though some are 30 by 40 feet square. These are entered by oval-shaped doors and are ventilated by round air spaces through the walls into the passages. The walls are about three feet six inches in thickness. The passages are chiseled or hewn as straight as could be laid out by an engineer. The ceilings of many of the rooms converge to a center.” “The side-passages near the entrance run at a sharp angle from the main hall, but toward the rear, they gradually reach a right angle in direction.” The Shrine “Over a hundred feet from the entrance is the cross-hall, several hundred feet long in which is found the idol, or image, of the people's god, sitting cross-legged, with lotus flower or lily in each hand. The cast of the face is oriental, the carving shows a skillful hand, and the entire object is remarkably well pre- served, as is everything in this cavern.” “The idol almost resembles Buddha, though the scientists are not certain as to what religious worship it represents. Taking into consideration everything found thus far, it is possible that this worship most resembles the ancient people of Tibet.” “Surrounding this idol are smaller images, some very beautiful in form; others crooked-necked and dis- torted shapes, symbolical probably, of good and evil. There are two large cactus with protruding arms, one on each side of the dais on which the God squats. All this is carved out of hard rock resembling marble. In the opposite corner of this cross-hall were found tools of all descriptions, made of copper.”"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 291 Appendix D: Scientific Evidence “These people undoubtedly knew the lost art of hardening this metal, which has been sought by chem- ists for centuries without result. On a bench running around the workroom was some charcoal and other material probably used in the process. There is also slag and stuff similar to matte, showing that these ancients smelted ores, but so far, no trace of where or how this was done has been discovered, nor the origin of the ore.” “Among the other finds are vases or urns and cups of copper and gold, made very artistic in design. The pottery work includes enameled ware and glazed vessels. Another passageway leads to granaries such as are found in the oriental temples. They contain seeds of various kinds. One very large storehouse has not yet been entered, as it is twelve feet high and can be reached only from above. Two copper hooks extend on the edge, which indicates that some sort of ladder was attached. These grannies are rounded, as the materials of which they are constructed, I think is a very hard cement. A Gray metal is also found in this cavern, which puzzles the scientists, for its identity has not been established. It resembles plati- num.” “Strewn promiscuously over the floor everywhere are what people call 'cats eyes,' a yellow stone of no great value. Each one is engraved with the head of the Malay type.” The Hieroglyphics “On all the urns, or walls over doorways, and tablets of stone which were found by the image are the mysterious hieroglyphics, the key to which the Smithsonian Institute hopes yet to discover. The engrav- ing on the tablets probably has something to do with the religion of the people. Similar hieroglyphics have been found in southern Arizona. Among the pictorial writings, only two animals are found. One is of prehistoric type.” The Crypt “The tomb or crypt in which the mummies were found is one of the largest of the chambers, the walls slanting back at an angle of about 35 degrees. On these are tiers of mummies, each one occupying a sep- arate hewn shelf. At the bead of each is a small bench, on which is found copper cups and pieces of bro- ken swords. Some of the mummies are covered with clay, and all are wrapped in a bark fabric. The urns or cups on the lower tiers are crude, while as the higher shelves are reached, the urns are finer in design, showing a later stage of civilization.” “It is worthy of note that all the mummies examined so far have proved to be male, no children or females being buried here. This leads to the belief that this exterior section was the warriors' barracks. Among the discoveries, no bones of animals have been found, no skins, no clothing, no bedding. Many of the rooms are bare but for water vessels. One room, about 40 by 700 feet, was probably the main din- ing hall, for cooking utensils are found here.” “What these people lived on is a problem, though it is presumed that they came south in the winter and farmed in the valleys, going back north in the summer. Upwards of 50,000 people could have lived in the caverns comfortably. One theory is that the present Indian tribes found in Arizona are descendants of the serfs or slaves of the people, which inhabited the cave. Undoubtedly a good many thousand of years before the Christian era a people lived here which reached a high stage of civilization. The chronology of human history is full of gaps.” Professor Jordan much enthused over the discoveries and believes that the find will prove of incalcula- ble value in archaeological work. “One thing I have not spoken of, may be of interest. There is one chamber, the passageway to which is not ventilated, and when we approached it a deadly, snaky smell struck us. Our light would not pene- trate the gloom, and until stronger ones are available, we will not know what the chamber contains."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Appendix D: Scientific Evidence 292 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Some say snakes, but other boo-hoo’d this idea and think it may contain a deadly gas or chemicals used by the ancients. No sounds are heard, but it smells snaky just the same.” “The whole underground installation gives one of shaky nerves the creeps. The gloom is like a weight on one's shoulders, and our flashlights and candles only make the darkness blacker. Imagination can revel in conjectures and ungodly daydreams back through the ages that have elapsed till the mind reels dizzily in space.” An Indian Legend In connection with this story, it is notable that among the Hopi Indians the tradition is told that their ancestors once lived in an underworld in the Grand Canyon till dissension arose between the good and the bad, the people of one heart and people of two hearts. Machetto, who was their chief, counseled them to leave the underworld, but there was no way out. The chief then caused a tree to grow up and pierce the roof of the underworld, and then the people of one heart climbed out. They tarried by Paisisvai (Red River), which is the Colorado, and grew grain and corn. They sent out a message to the Temple of the Sun, asking the blessing of peace, good will and rain for people of one heart. That messenger never returned, but today at the Hopi villages at sundown can be seen the old men of the tribe out on the housetops gazing toward the sun, looking for the messenger. When he returns, their lands and ancient dwelling place will be restored to them. That is the tradition. Among the engravings of animals in the cave is seen the image of a heart over the spot where it is located. The legend was learned by W. E. Rollins the artist, during a year spent with the Hopi Indians. There are two theories of the origin of the Egyptians. One is that they came from Asia; another that the racial cradle was in the upper Nile region. Heeren, an Egyptologist, believed in the Indian origin of the Egyptians. The discoveries in the Grand Canyon may throw further light on human evolution and pre- historic ages. Connection Between Egypt And China BEIJING, Aug. 7, 2001 More than a dozen heads of maces dating back to between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago, extremely similar to those used by kings of ancient Egypt, were recently unearthed in northwest China. “The findings indicate that the contact between east and west civilizations began as early as the prehis- toric period,” said Li Shuicheng, a professor from the archaeological department of Beijing University. Previously, historical documents and archaeological discoveries have shown that east and west cultural exchanges started from the Qin and Han dynasties over 2,000 years ago. The new discovery greatly pushes back that date. The oldest ones among the mace-heads found in Gansu, Shaanxi and Xinjiang in northwest China date back to 5,500 years ago, judging from the stratum of the relic site and the type of the remains. “Many experts shared the view that the mace-heads were not a product of the ancient Chinese civiliza- tion, but were transmitted from the west,” said Li, adding “The exchange ability of the ancients might have surpassed our imagination.” Li showed pictures of the mace-heads, found in Gansu, Shaanxi and Xinjiang in northwest China. They are made of stone, jade or bronze, and are in the shape of balls, peaches, oblates, pentagrams, sheep- heads or bull-heads. Some of them even carry colored drawings. Their shapes and functions are surpris- ingly similar to those of ancient Egypt, said noted. The mace was a special instrument indicating status and authority. Egypt has the earliest and the most mace-head relics in the world. In addition, a large number of mace-heads have been discovered in the Near East, Mesopotamia and the prairie of Eurasia. But they are seldom found in the valley of the Yellow River."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 293 Appendix D: Scientific Evidence “When the mace-heads were excavated in China, some of them were mistaken for strange weapons or spindles,” said Li. South American Atlantis By Kathy A. Svitil The Aymara people of the Bolivian highlands have long told stories of a lost underwater city: Wanaku, the Atlantis of South America. They have whispered tales of a mysterious island in Lake Titicaca, the world's highest navigable lake, with a hidden entrance to underground passageways built by the Inca. Now researchers have found the first concrete evidence that those legends may be true. In August, divers with the Italian firm of Akakor Geographical Exploring conducted a series of 250 dives in Titicaca's murky waters. Led by a 2300-foot-long ancient road, now under water, they found the remains of a 660-foot-long and 160-foot-wide stone temple between 65 to100 feet below the water's surface. The team also discovered a terrace, a 2600-foot-long containing wall, along with a stone anchor, vases, and bones from cameloid animals such as llama or alpaca that may have been killed in a ritual sacrifice. The ruins lie in the waters between Bolivia's Copacabana Peninsula and Isla del Sol, home to the Tem- ple of the Sun, where the Incan dynasty is said to have been born. They date to between 1,500 and 1,000 years ago, before the rise of the Incan Empire, when the Tiahuanaco people occupied the shores of Titi- caca. The submerged ruins may be the remains of the Aymara's legendary city, or could have been assimilated by the Inca Empire itself. “The underground passageways were reputed to link many parts of the Incan Empire with the capital at Cossack,” says head diver Stefano Castelli. “Somebody else said he removed a stone from the bottom of the lake, and saw water going down inside the hole.” Ancient Skeletons Expand Man's Past By Robert S. Boyd (Knight Ridder Newspapers) An astonishing number of previously unknown relatives are turning up in the human family scrapbook, as archaeologists dig up the remains of long-lost great-great-uncles and aunts who once shared our planet. The fossils of three more ancient ancestors were reported this year. Scientists have now identi- fied at least 17 prehuman species that once walked on Earth. The skulls and bones of more than 5,000 archaic individuals have been found, some dating more than 5 million years, according to Rick Potts, director of the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution. The latest find, reported earlier this month, appears to introduce the earliest members of our family tree yet discovered — a colony of 5.5 million-year-old forest dwellers living in what is now Ethiopia. Their remains share features common to both apes and humans. Thanks to the rapid pace of discovery, the number of known or suspected human ancestors has almost doubled since the 1980s. Experts have been forced to rewrite their textbooks and encyclopedias. A Tangled Family tree The old idea of a straight line of evolution leading steadily upward from apes to shaggy cavemen to clean-shaven Wall Street brokers has been abandoned. “Our evolutionary history now looks more like a tangled bush than a simple tree,” Leslie Aiello, an anthropologist at University College, London, wrote in the journal Nature. Some of these vanished species were “immensely successful,” Potts reports in his book, “Humanity's Descent.” One line, called Homo erectus, survived for almost 2 million years — at least 10 times longer"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Appendix D: Scientific Evidence 294 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation than modern humans have been around. But all except our own species, Homo sapiens, turned out to be evolutionary dead ends. In the struggle for survival, our own forebears out-competed, out-thought and possibly slaughtered less versatile, less intelligent rival species. The last of our ancient cousins, the lumbering Neanderthals, coexisted with Homo sapiens in Europe and the Near East until about 25,000 years ago. They may even have mated with our forebears. Homo erectus survived until about 50,000 years ago, overlapping with both Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens. In the latest version of the story of human origins, we are members of a large family called “hominids,” which arose in Africa and included apes and humans. The apes and our ancestors parted ways about 6 million years ago. Our branch of the hominids eventually split into various subfamilies, tribes, genera and species. A species is a collection of creatures that can breed with one another. A genus is a closely related group of species. A tribe is a group of genera (the plural of “genus”). At last count, there were three tribes, five genera and 18 species assigned to the hominid family, including six extinct species of the genus Homo and us. The Adaptability Factor Anthropologists don't all agree on the details of these classifications, but the general outline is broadly accepted. Orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and humans are the only survivors of these multiple evolu- tionary experiments. The question, said Potts, is “What allowed some hominids to endure while others died out?” Part of the answer is that Homo sapiens was better able than more specialized species to adapt to the rapidly changing climate of its homeland in Africa between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, when what had been a warm, moist environment turned cold and dry. “If a species is tied to a given setting, it can be annihilated if the setting changes,” William Schopf, director of the Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in his book, “Cradle of Life.” In addition to its adaptability, the ability of Homo sapiens to use language was the key new behavior that let our ancestors prevail over their rivals, accord- ing to Ian Tattersall, curator of anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Speech enabled our forebears to communicate and cooperate more effectively to hunt prey, escape pred- ators and pass on skills to the next generation. Pre-Modern Homo Sapiens The Jinniushan cranium found in 1985 by a student excavation team from Peking University under the direction of Prof. Lu Zun'e, is one of the more recent fossil human specimens discovered in China. The cranium was directly associated with a partial skeleton, including a complete pelvis, portions of the spi- nal column, and nearly complete hand and foot bones. The remains were recovered from a collapsed limestone cave in Yingkou county, Liaoning. The human bearing deposits have been dated to approxi- mately 250-280,000 years ago. The Jinniushan cranium shows certain derived features that ally it to early forms of H. sapiens. These traits include a cranial capacity within the range of modern people, thin vault bones, an expansion of the parietal region, a more gracile cranial base and a more rounded occipi- tal bone, posteriorly. In other respects it shares features with H. erectus such as projecting brow ridges, low cranial height and an elongate, strongly buttressed cranial vault. In this oblique view many of the salient features of the Jinniushan cranium discussed above can be clearly seen. This cranium, as well as those from Dali and Maba to be discussed below display derived traits generally associated with H. sapiens yet are definitely more archaic looking than early modern humans. They may best be characterized as pre-modern forms of H. sapiens. Such “pre-modern” human specimens have only recently come to light in China. The presence of these transitional forms in China"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 295 Appendix D: Scientific Evidence during the Late Middle through Early Late Pleistocene has been used to support the argument for local evolutionary continuity in China between H. erectus and modern humans. The Dali specimen from Shaanxi, is dated to approximately 180,000 YA. It is similar in many ways to Jinniushan and represents a pre-modern form of H. sapiens. Its cranial capacity is intermediate between earlier forms of H. erectus and later more modern forms of H. sapiens, although it overlaps the range of variation seen in both. Dali is also intermediate in its morphological character, retaining many features associated with Asian H. erectus while evincing a number of derived features associated with modern humans such as expansion of the parietals and transformation in cranial base anatomy. In this oblique view the long, low contour of the Dali cranial vault is readily apparent. The upper jaw has been fractured and dislocated upwards giving the cranium the appearance of having a very short face. Actually the face would be very similar in overall dimensions to the Jinniushan cranium upon reconstruction. The Dali cranium has extremely robust brow ridges. They do not, however, assume the straight bar-like character of the brow seen at Zhoukoudian and are more similar structurally to the brow seen in archaic humans from Europe and Africa. Dali is dated to a time when Neanderthals were spread throughout much of Europe. The facial anatomy of Dali is very different from that seen in Neanderthals and is much more similar to that seen in later, more modern looking humans not only in China but northern and eastern Africa as well. This lateral view of Dali shows the rounding of the posterior con- tour of the skull, differing in this respect from the “pinched” look seen in H. erectus. The base of the Dali cranium is much more modern looking than that of H. erectus. The tympanic plate is thin and fore- shortened, much as in modern humans and quite distinct from the tubular form seen in H. erectus. The Maba cranium, dated to approximately 120,000 years ago was discovered in 1958 in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. It was the first substantial specimen of a pre-modern form of H. sapi- ens found in East Asia. It was initially thought to be an Asian Neanderthal but does not in fact show any of the derived features of Neanderthals as known from Europe and the Near East. The Maba skull is similar to other more complete finds of pre-modern H. sapiens subsequently found in China, differing only in minor ways, such as the size and shape of the orbits and nasal bones. Maba is also somewhat reminiscent of the recently discovered Narmada skull from India. Alien Skull Discovered in Bulgaria Leyla Degirmen, UFO Roundup correspondent in the Balkans, has come across a strange story in the Turkish newspaper Milliyet, which stated that an alien skull was found last May in southern Bulgaria. “On May 21, 2001, a villager found an unusual skull on Rodolp Mountain in Bulgaria,” somewhere near Ardino and Madan, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of Sofia, the national capital. “Some scientists held a meeting in Asenovgrad. Prof. Yordan Yordanov, one of the best-known anthro- pologists in Europe, claimed that he had never seen a human or an animal skull like this in his life. Katya Melamet, one of the archaeologists at the Bulgarian Science Academy, has also told that she has never seen anything like this.” “The story of the villager is also very interesting,” Leyla writes, “He claimed that he had seen five peo- ple, with yellow metallic clothes, in his dream. They told the villager to go to the area on the 21st of May, and when he went there, he found the skull and a (small) elliptical metal object.” “The skull is (weighs) about 250 grams and has six holes in it to (which apparently) belong to the senses. The skull also has no mouth hole.” “This summary is from an article published in Milliyet on January 4, 2002.\""},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Appendix D: Scientific Evidence 296 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Giants on the Loose Rex Gilroy on the “Yowie” According to the Aborigines, the yowies were terrifying to look upon: fearsome and hairy, up to or over 2.6 metres in height, with strong muscular bodies, powerful arms and large hands longer than a human's. They walked upright upon two legs with a stooped gait. Their heads were sunk into their shoulders, giving them the stooped appearance. They had a pointed sagittal crest {skull dome} and a receding forehead with thick, protruding eyebrow-ridges and large deeply-set eyes. Males were often hairier than females, who had long pendulous breasts. The feet of the yowie were much larger than those of a normal-sized human, and possessed an opposable big toe. These mysterious hominids roamed the remoter, forest-covered mountain regions either in small family groups or hunting in ones and twos, their females and young secreted back in their lairs. The Aborigines both feared and respected the yowies, venerating them as sacred creatures from the Dreamtime. In fact, as already pointed out, Aboriginal folklore is still full of giant manlike beings, creatures sometimes over three meters in height. While some were giant humans who made massive stone tools and sometimes fire, others were more ape-like. These giants are perhaps the real enigma of Australia's Stone Age history, for apart from these tools there are no fossil bones to convince anthropologists of their former presence here. They accept the presence of such beings in Pleistocene Java and China, for their massive fossil jaws and teeth are known from there; but otherwise, nothing short of such fossil evidence from Australia will ever convince these scientists that giant hominid forms once roamed this continent-not even evidence of their huge fossil footprints which, together with those of other, smaller hominids, have turned up in every Australian state!. Monster Hominids in Australia Let us now examine these monster hominids in more detail with other evidence which further demon- strates that Australia possesses a vast, rich store of hitherto unknown and 'unwritten' history. Cowra, Central Western NSW Embedded in a shoal of mudstone on a hillside near Cowra in central western New South Wales are two half intact, enormous manlike footprints. Measuring almost one meter in length by 45 centimeters width across the toes, local Aborigines claim they were made by a giant man who stood 7.6 meters tall and who lived around Cowra in the long ago Dreamtime. If such height for any giant hominid ancestor seems unbelievable to some people, I might add here that I have found the Aboriginal descriptions of extinct giant marsupial and other mega fauna of the last ice- age extremely reliable. And, as I have said, giant-sized fossil hominid tracks are found Australia-wide. Penrith, New South Wales Take, for example, the six 61-cm long by 46-cm wide manlike fossilized footprints discovered in mud- stone in April 1970 near Penrith at the base of the eastern escarpment of the Blue Mountains of NSW. The size of the tracks, spaced two metres apart, suggested the monster that made them must have been at least four metres tall. Bathurst NSW Identical fossil tracks have been found in the Bathurst district to the west of the Blue Mountains in the vicinity of the giant megatool discoveries of mine. Could we be looking at the fossilized tracks of Meganthropus, or as I have suggested earlier, a 'home-grown' race of giant people?"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 297 Appendix D: Scientific Evidence Townsville-Rockhampton Queensland Another giant fossil footprint, identical to the Penrith and Bathurst examples and measuring 61 cm long by 46 cm wide across the toes, was found near Townsville, Queensland, in 1952. More fossilized giant manlike footprints of these dimensions have been found in the Mount Isa district of Queensland. In the same region, according to Aborigines, a race of monsterous four-to-five-metre-tall giant men and women-the “Kalkadoons”-once lived during the Dreamtime. These monsters are reminiscent of the “Illankanpanka” of Rockhampton, Queensland, Aboriginal lore- 10-to-12-metre-tall giant beings. Are all these monster hominids representative of a single race? Given Aboriginal size exaggeration over vast distances, there nonetheless exists some truly monstrous stone implements, such as a number found sometime ago on a property outside Rockhampton, that are far, far larger and heavier than any I have found near Bathurst. Monster hominids of the six-to-eight-meter-tall variety could help explain some of the truly unbeliev- able large manlike fossil footprints to be covered in this chapter. Were they from outside Australia? Or, as Aborigines claim, did they originate on this continent? Townsville Aborigines claim the huge fossil tracks found there in 1925 was made by a member of the “Narragun” race. Roper River {Northern territory} Aborigines have left rock carvings of giant-sized footprints, measur- ing up to 38 centimeters and more in length., which represent those made by the legendary giant “Nagarun” people who, during the Dreamtime walked from the east coast of Arnhem Land down the Wilton River to the Roper, and then eastward to the Borroloola in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Prehistoric ochre cave art in Arnhem Land depicts giant marsupials, among other animals. Wullagun, a tribal elder, once described them: “When giant fellas alive, them big animals still bin walkabouts this country. White men say they all dead, but we savvy one place where him still live. Ground shake when he walk. He eat peo- ples” Similar traditions are built around the charcoal painting of two five-metre-tall figures depicted upon the side of a rock overhang near Townsville, representing two Illankanpanka giant men who wandered mountains thereabouts in the long ago Dreamtime. Orange NSW South-west of Orange, NSW, embedded in a 3.6-metre by 6.6 metre lump of solid mudstone is an appar- ent giant manlike footprint, an astounding 1.6 metres long by one metre wide across the toes. The ques- tion is whether the footprint is an actual fossilized track or an example of ancient weathered rock art depicting a footprint of the Bulloo, the giant men and woman known to the Aborigines of western New South Wales in ancient times. Apart from the fossil footprints of manlike beings, there are also fossil tracks of giant creatures that appear more ape-like than manlike. Could these tracks be those of Gigantopithecus, the giant manlike ape that roamed mainland Asia and Java half a million years ago? Much smaller, although still quite large ape-like tracks are preserved in mudstone near Jenolan Caves south-west of Katoomba and resem- ble the much larger Gigantopithecus-like footprint fossils. But how are footprints fossilized? Scientists have demonstrated that most footprint fossils have been preserved through the action of volcanic eruptions, a layer of ash covering the tracks to cool and solidify them quickly, thus protecting them over thousands of years, weathering disintegrated the solidified vol- canic ash covering to expose the now fossilized tracks. The problem with dating many tracks is in deter- mining exactly when volcanic eruptions ceased in the areas where fossil footprints have been found."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Appendix D: Scientific Evidence 298 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Huge fossil tracks said by Aborigines to have been left by the “Narragun giants” near Mt Gambier, South Australia, come from volcanic deposits which could be anywhere up to a million years old. Vol- canic eruptions in ice-age Victoria, on the other hand, have produced hominid evidence preserved by much recent lava flows. For example, the lava flow from the Scoria Cone at Mount Buninyong, about 10 kilo metres south-east of Ballarat, covered a lake deposit from which, in 1864, the disputed Buninyong bone implement was found at a depth of 80 metres together with the remains of an extinct Kangaroo. The implement is part of a rib of a 'Nototherium', and has been cut to an irregular point from opposite sides. The Buninyong remains are dated at least 200,000 years old. The most extensive series of giant-and smaller-sized, volcanically-preserved fossil hominid footprints and handprints so far discovered at any single Australian location are embedded in mudstone deep in the Carrai Range, which rises up to 1,300 meters above sea level, 60 Kilometers west of Kempsey on the New South Wales north coast. My wife Heather and I discovered the tracks during the course of a yowie field research expedition which we made to the Kempsey district in April 1977. Early sightings reports from last century led us to explore the Carrai Range, and it was during an inspection of cliffs overlooking a remote gully that we stumbled upon the fossil tracks. They are embedded in two huge, obliquely-tilted slabs situated either side of a deep cutting overlooking a wide, deep gully. Although, it is difficult to visualize now, the whole area once had been swampland. Groups of giant creatures and their children had walked, squatted and sat upon the edge of this swamp, Then, soon afterwards, the peace was shattered. Volcanic ash and lava poured out of a nearby crater and forced the giants to flee for their lives, covering the tracks. In great ages past, a river cut its way through the swamp, gradually cutting a deep into the Earth below the layers of lava and ash and forming a deep gully. Heat and rain gradually re-exposed the tracks, while wind and erosion cut away at the base of the nearby cliffs, hollowing out deep rock shelters beneath the fossil tracks. This gradually had the effect of splitting the rock above, which eventually resulted in two huge sections containing the fossils falling into the cutting created by erosion. Volcanologist's are divided on when the volcanic eruptions here- abouts ceased, but it is certain that this event took place no later than about one million years ago! Since the initial fossil/handprint discovery, two further mudstone track sites have been discovered nearby, bringing the total fossil impressions to about 90 tracks! The footprints range from child-sized examples measuring 20 cm long by 10 cm wide and 26 cm long by 13 cm wide, to monstrous tracks 62 cm long by 33 cm wide across the toes, and one truly monstrous half-intact track of 42 cm width across the toes by 60 cm length to the mid-foot where the track breaks off. Had this track been complete it would have reached up to 120 centimeters in length! There are handprints of various sizes, from 13 cm length by 23 cm width, to one monstrous left-hand- print measuring an astounding 41 cm width from outstretched thumb to little finger, by 35 cm length from mid-finger to palm! Some footprints look like giant human tracks, whereas others are more ape- like, but it is obvious that the monsterous beings who made these tracks in the sands of time stood any- where from 4 to 6.6 to even 8.3 metres tall. Aborigines who have seen the fossil tracks and handprints say they were made by two different races of giant beings: the giant “Goolagah, and the half-man, half-animal forefathers of the yowies. The evi- dence suggests that giant hominids shared the region with Gigantopithecus-type creatures in the begin- ning of the last ice age when volcanic eruptions were commonplace in northern New South Wales. Blacktown NSW On Thursday 27th, July 1989, my wife Heather and I stumbled upon two fossilized giant-man tracks preserved on two mudstone slabs a few meters apart from one another upon a creek-bank near Black- town, west of Sydney. One is a modern human foot and measuring 53 cm length by 19 cm width across"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 299 Appendix D: Scientific Evidence the toes. The second example, a right foot, is 44 cm long by 22 cm wide and is obviously distorted due to it having been impressed into softer mud than the other track. Were the tracks those of two separate hominids or a single individual? Even allowing for size distortions in the original soft mud, the creature or creatures who left these tracks must have been of considerable size-at least three metres in height. The mudstone itself is at least 200,000 years old. Penrith NSW The former presence of the Goolagah is preserved in the rock art of the old Dharuk people of the Penrith district. Upon a vertical rock-face near the town is the pecked rock carving of a large “mundoe” or man- like foot, indicating the Doolagahs once inhabited the area. It measures 35 cm length by 17 cm in width across the five toes. According to the former Blue Mountains Aborigines who related these tales to European settlers in the 1800's, the Goolagah monster men and women were gigantic in every physical feature, with large heads, thick arm and leg muscles, and feet much larger than any normal Aborigine. Males were big-chested and very hairy, while the females had less hair and long pendulous breasts far larger than those of any lubra! These monstrous beings lived and hunted throughout the Sydney region. In what is now the western suburbs area, the giant men, women and their children were a commonplace sight, hunting monitor liz- ards with their large stone or wooden clubs and spears. The Aborigines lived in fear of the Goolagah, whose powerful forms must have been an awesome, terrifying sight to any lone tribesman crouching in fear behind bushes as they passed by. As Aboriginal traditions across Australia tell of battles fought with the giant creatures, it is obvious that they were wiped out around 40,000 years ago-although some present-day Aborigines maintain that in some far-off unexplored mountainous areas some of these giant people linger on. Blue Mountains Aborigines claimed the Doolgahl wandered the mountain-tops hunting the giant kanga- roos, giant monitor lizards and other creatures, killing them with spears and stones. They were/are said to inhabit the New England region of northern New South Wales where fresh campsites could be found. Brewarrina I know of stories even from Europeans, telling of giant-sized stone and wooden tools and weapons found in north-western and northern New South Wales today-such as one freshly abandoned campsite found by a prospector near Brewarrina in 1973. Tweed Valley Giant man-beasts with large wooden clubs have been claimed seen in the Tweed Valley on the Queen- sland side of the NSW-Queensland border even in the 70s. Giant Aboriginal People: And then there are the traditions of a form of giant Aboriginal people, claimed by their smaller, modern counterparts to have survived in remote regions. If such Astraloid giants existed, they were, like their monster hominid neighbors, the result of genetic mutation caused by vari- ous environmental factors. A population of giant Aborigines were said to have once roamed the central west of NSW, side by side with the other giant hominids. Old Aboriginal tales of a giant race having roamed the Pilliga region near Coonabarabran were perhaps vindicated in 1969 with a farmer's discov- ery near Coolah, east of Coonabarabran, of a reputed giant-sized Endocast fossil hominid skull, said to be not unlike the Bathurst Skull No. 1 described in Chapter 14. Marble Man, Caleula One day in May 1889, Mr. Frederick Sala, an Orange, NSW quarryman, was digging at the Caleula quarry, about 50 kilometers out of Blayney, when he unearthed what he thought at first was an ancient statue of a normal-sized male body encased in marble. Thinking it might also be the fossilized body of some prehistoric human, he lifted it with some difficulty into a large crate on his cart and journeyed into"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Appendix D: Scientific Evidence 300 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Orange to show off his find to the amazed locals. The figure, he thought, had to be that of a freak fir it had seven toes on each foot, one eye and no arms, and one leg was thinner than the other. The arms had probably been lost in the course of the fossilization process. The marble in with the figure was found with a molted color, whereas that of the corpse was pure white. Doctors who subsequently studied the 'marble man' thought him unique because of the perfect preservation of such features as water humours of the eye and the cartilage of the nose which, in normal human remains, dry up after death. The one remaining eye was well-formed, but there were an unequal number of ribs on each side of the figure's chest. A Sydney based scientist, Dr. C. W. McCarthy, declared the 'marble man' to be an actual petrified human corpse. It was obvious the 'marble man' was a form of Endocast, which would explain certain irregularities of the figure due to geological pressures over untold thousands of years. The “Marble Man of Orange” was soon taken to Sydney for public exhibition at two shillings admission, attracting large audiences of inquisitive people. Sculptors who examined the figure declared it was definitely not a statue as some people had suggested. The 'marble man' was undoubtedly of very great antiquity to have first been buried in lime-impregnated sediments and gradually to have become fossilized in the way 'he had'. However, the mystery remains unexplained because after the exhibition 'he' was sold to an antiquarian dealer and shipped to Europe where the remarkable fossil disappeared. Marble Man, Gympie Queensland: Another 'marble man', seven feet tall in height, was discovered by miners outside Gympie, Queensland, in 1914. They had just used explosives to blast a quantity of lime- stone at an open-cut operation. As one of the workmen began clearing away some of the rubble, his eyes fell upon a large human-looking head which had completely turned to limestone. Meanwhile, other miners began finding pieces of arms, legs, a torso, etcetera, until finally, after a detailed search of the rubble, they had collected an entire body-a seven-foot-tall giant male. The fossil giant was obviously another Endocast and of immense age. It is said the fragmented hominid was crated down to the Brisbane Museum but subsequently, once there, all trace of it was lost. Such remains which question long-accepted indoctrination's of our ancient past seldom see the light of day once they fall into the hands of such institutions. As I mentioned earlier, the Endocast process is along one and can take up to 250,000 years. But if mudstone and limestone endocasting can preserve remains up to this age, then how old might an agatised hominid skull be? Moree About 1971, a fossicker working on a property near Moree, northern NSW, dug up from a gravel bed a fossilized, primitive-looking hominid skull reminiscent of my Bathurst Skull No. 2. it was completely agatised, showing teeth and empty sockets. This Wadjak-type skull is surely of Pre-Astraloid age, but just how old it might be remains a mystery, for agatisation of a fossil must take considerably longer than mudstone endocasting. Once again, as with the skull-types already dealt with, as well as the fossilized hominid ape-like foot- prints preserved in volcanic ash-flows uncountable years ago, we are faced with the obvious conclu- sion; in comparison with these and other early hominids, the Australian Aborigines, while they undoubtedly evolved here, were mere latecomers on the Australian landscape. Inverell 1993 On Friday (September 1993), yet one more giant-sized hominid fossilized footprint was added to such a list of such 'Titan tootsies' coming to light across the continent. My wife heather and I were exploring scrub country outside Inverell in Northern New England, about 140 kilometres east of Moree, when quite by accident we stumbled upon a shoal of weathered mudstone. Here, embedded in the rock, we found and measured a single large hominid footprint impression."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 301 Appendix D: Scientific Evidence The track is that of a right foot, probably distorted in the original soft mud, and is 44 cm in length by 30 cm across the toes. There were signs that other tracks had been embedded nearby, but these have gradu- ally weathered away 'till hardly any trace of them remains. perhaps they were originally covered by a volcanic ash flow. Signs of volcanic activity are to be found all around the Inverell district, and weath- ered basalt nearby the fossil footprints suggests that this and the other tracks had originally been cov- ered by volcanic activity. Maybe this single surviving weathered giant tracks belonged to one of a whole group, perhaps a family of giant hominids, fleeing from the eruption which subsequently covered their tracks-in a similar way to those more famous normal-sized hominid tracks, found in 1974 by anthropologist Dr Mary Leakey at Laetoli in Tanzania, which proved to scientists at the time that early hominids were already walking fully upright like modern humans three and a half million years ago. The Inverell 'megaman' and his relatives obviously walked the landscape hereabouts a very long time ago. If the Carrai range fossil tracks are any guide, then we could be safe in assuming the Inverell fossil is of the same antiquity-that is, preserved by a lava flow that occurred no later than a million years ago! The monster hominid whose single footprint still survives must have been enormous, at least four metres in height and of great weight and strength. Aborigines of later times across Australia, particularly the New England district, kept well clear of these hairy giants unless they were well-armed and in sufficient numbers to oppose them. According to tradi- tions of the New England tribes, they eventually killed off the giant race in the long ago Dreamtime. Old settlers' tales of the Inverell region speak of other, earlier giant fossil footprint discoveries hereabouts— so perhaps more await discovery, or re-discovery, in the scrub country of this ancient landscape.

Some consider this to be a result of leaks from the intelligence community. The fact is that there has been wide and profound change of public attitude in this regard. An example of this is how the alien image underwent a significant change during the years, from the ridiculed “little green men” of the car- toons in the early fifties to the classical “grays” as benevolent “space brothers” in seventies. Later, how- ever, they have become more and more malicious and associated with the phenomena of cattle mutilation and human abduction. This picture is probably the one most often associated with the word “aliens” nowadays. But in the past few years there appeared a new type of aliens: the “reptilians” (also called “reptoids,” “sauroids” etc.). The media and market became flooded by reptile/dragon/dinosaur characters. The entertainment industry made them almost omnipresent, from children toys and cartoons to most suc- cessful movies. This phenomena is analyzed to some extent in the file The Cult of the Serpent and oth- ers. UFO researcher John Rhodes devoted a whole website to it ( http://www.reptoids.com ). Several “alien files” available on the internet (Crimram files, Secrets of the Mojave, Omega etc.) present a compilation of manifold information about aliens in earth's history, presence and possible future as well as many of the related incidents regarding space and underground explorations. They also include quotations from various scriptures including the Bible and the Vedas. (Note: The term “Veda,” literally “knowledge,” the indologists usually apply to the four Vedas: Rg, Sama, Yajur and Atharva. However, in broader sense, it is also used for the related literature as the Puranas, Brahmanas, Aranya- kas, Itihasas etc. In this sense I will be using it in this article.) The fact that in these files the reptilians are associated with the Nagas of the ancient Vedic tradition is one of the reasons I have decided to write this article. I wished to add to the wealth of information by using the Vedas as very valuable, yet so far under-used resource, together with other sources. As this topic is very extensive I possibly could not cover it in its entirety. Chapter Two presents a brief overview and further chapters concentrate mainly on the Vedic references to Nagas presented mainly in the chapter 4.2. For the references to the recent encounters with reptilians please refer to the bibliogra- phy listing. The Saurian Connection: Historical Background of the Serpent. The snake (serpent spirit) has been a symbol of wisdom, eternity, healing, mystery, magical power, and holiness throughout most of the ancient non-western world. Its symbol is used today in medicine, and other healing professions, and its live descendants are hailed as sacred and used in everything from cancer drugs to sex potions. Serpent was worshiped in ancient Babylon, Mexico, Egypt, as well as many other places all over the world. The following passage is written by Soror Ourania (from “Thelemix and Therion Rising”) from the Gnostic point of view."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents 304 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation “The word Naga is rooted in Sanskrit and means “serpent.” [Further meanings from the Sanskrit- English Dictionary by Monier-Williams: m. “not moving,” a mountain (in Atharva Veda); the number 7 (because of the 7 principal mountains; any tree or plant (in Mahabharata); the sun.] In the East Indian pantheon it is connected with the Serpent Spirit and the Dragon Spirit. It has an equivalence to the Bur- mese Nats, or god-serpents. In the Esoteric Tradition it is synonymous for Adepts, or Initiates. In India and Egypt, and even in Central and South America, the Naga stands for one who is wise. “The [buddhist philosopher] Nagarjuna of India, for example, is shown with an aura, or halo, of seven serpents which is an indication of a very high degree of Initiation. The symbolism of the seven serpents, usually cobras, are also on Masonic aprons or certain systems in the Buddhist ruins of Cambodia (Ankhor) and Ceylon. The great temple-builders of the famous Ankhor Wat were considered to be the semi-divine Khmers. The avenue leading to the Temple is lined with the seven-headed Naga. And even in Mexico, we find the “Naga” which becomes “Nagal.” In China, the Naga is given the form of the Dragon and has a direct association with the Emperor and is known as the “Son of Heaven”... while in Egypt the same association is termed “King-Initiate.” The Chinese are even said to have originated with the Serpent demi-gods and even to speak their language, Naga-Krita. For a place that has no serpents, Tibet, they are still known in a symbolic sense and are called “Lu!” (Naga). Nagarjuna called in Tibetan, [becomes] Lu-trub. “In the Western traditions we find the same ubiquity for the Naga, or Serpent. One simple example is the Ancient Greek Goddess, Athena. She is known as a warrior Goddess as well as the Goddess of Wis- dom; her symbol being the Serpent as displayed on her personal shield. Of course, in Genesis the Ser- pent is a Naga who instructs the new infant (humanity) in what is called the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The Christian church has, unfortunately transformed the Initiate-Teacher into a tempting and neg- ative demon-character. An apocryphal tradition says that Apollonius of Tyana, while on a visit to India, was taught by the “Nagas” of Kashmir. (See The Life of Apollonius, by Philostratos) It is felt by many scholars of the Western Tradition that the life of Apollonius was taken from the New Testament, or that the narratives of the New Testament have been taken from the life of Apollonius. This is felt because of the undisputed and clear similarities of construction of that particular narrative. “Naga is one of a handful of rare words surviving the loss of the first universal language. In Buddhism, Wisdom has always been tied, symbolically, to the figure of the Serpent. In the Western Tradition it can be found as used by the Christ in the Gospel of Saint Matthew (10:16), “Be ye therefore wise as ser- pents, and harmless as doves.” “In all mythological language the snake is also an emblem of immortality. Its endless representation with its tail in its mouth (Ouroboros), and the constant renewal of its skin and vigor, enliven the sym- bols of continued youth and eternity. “The Serpent's reputation for positive medicinal and/or life-preserving qualities have also contributed to the honors of the Serpent as STILL seen by the employment of the caduceus [staff around which two snakes are wrapped]. To this very day, the Hindus are taught that at the end of every Universal Manifes- tation (Kalpa) all things are re-absorbed into Deity during the interval between “creations.” He reposes upon the Serpent Shesha (Duration) who is called Ananta, or Endless.” Serpent in Cultural Traditions Indo-European (Slavic) Folklore The Slavic folklore often mentions snakes as the guards of treasures hidden underground or in caves closely following the Vedic tradition. Some of the snakes are said to possess a crown which is an inter- esting detail as we will see later."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 305 Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents Although one may be tempted to discount the folklore as unreliable source there is certain evidence which seems to support it. Czech herpetologist Jiri Hales writes in his book “Moji pratele hadi (“My friends, the snakes”) about his travels around eastern Slovakia in '70 in search of unusually great snakes and mentions several interest- ing accounts he heard from the local people. One even involves a military unit which was called to destroy an alleged 15 ft. long snake. (Snakes of such length are unknown in this part of the world.) Another account pertains to a ranger who noticed a number of snakes in the forest crawling in one direc- tion and out of curiosity followed them. Thus he has come upon a great “snake king” with a crown on his head surrounded by many snakes. Scared, he quickly left that place. Other accounts involve small children who claimed to play with great snakes and even communicate with them. Hales concludes that these accounts are credible as they include many details which a layman could not possibly make up without personal experience. North America: Hopi Tribal Tradition The Hopi legend is that there were two races, the children of the feather who came from the skies, and the children of the reptile who came from under the earth. The children of the reptile chased the Hopi Indians out of the earth. These evil under-grounders were also called Two Hearts. The Hopi Indian Legend of Creation tells of three different beginnings. One story says that Hopi have arisen from an underground paradise through an opening called Sipapu. The underground paradise was wondrous with beautiful clear skies and plentiful food sources [cf bila-svarga]. It was because of the existence of those called Two Hearts, the bad ones, that refuge was sought in the upper world by the Hopi, the peaceful ones. The underworld was not destroyed but was only sealed up to prevent the Two Hearts from rising upon to the surface world. The second story tells of the descent of the Hopi from the Blue Star of a constellation called the Seven Sisters. One version tells of their travel to earth on the back of Enki, the eagle. Grandfather, the Great Spirit, allowed the first man to select his home from the many stars of the universe. Enki told first man of his home earth, and brought him to visit. First man's exploration of the earth convinced him that this was where he wanted his children to be born and to grow. First Man returned to the heavens to tell Grandfather of his decision. Grandfather was pleased and granted to first man the right to call earth his home. First man soon returned to the green place or Sakwap with his family shortly afterwards. (Many of the hero stories throughout time and through many different cultures refer to a valiant group of seven.) These two legends remind of the story of Kashyapa Muni and his two wives, Kadru, the mother of ser- pents, and Vinata, the mother of Garuda, the divine eagle, mentioned later. Western Africa The Legend of Da - The world was created by Nana-Buluku, the one god, who is neither male nor female. In time, Nana-Buluku gave birth to twins, Mawu and Lisa, and it is they who shaped the world and control it still, with their fourteen children, the Vodou, or lesser gods. In the beginning, before Mawu had any children, the Rainbow Serpent, Da, already existed - created to serve Nana-Buluku. The creator was carried everywhere in Da's mouth. Rivers, mountains, and valleys twine and curve because that is how the Rainbow Serpent Da moves. Wherever they stopped for the night, mountains arose, formed from the serpent's dung. That is why if you dig down deep into a mountain, you find riches. Now, when Nana-Buluku had finished creating, it was obvious that the earth just couldn't carry every- thing - all the mountains, trees, peoples, and animals. So, to keep the earth from capsizing, the creator asked Da to coil beneath it to cushion it - like the pads the African women and girls wear on their heads when they are carrying a heavy load."},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents 306 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Because Da cannot stand heat, the creator made the ocean for the serpent to live in. And there Da has remained since the beginning of time, with his tail in his mouth. Even though the water keeps Da cool, he sometimes shifts around trying to get comfortable, and that's what causes earthquakes. Nana-Buluku tasked the red monkeys who live beneath the sea to keep Da fed, and they spend their time forging the iron bars that are the serpent's food. But sooner or later the monkey's supply of iron is bound to run out, and then Da will have nothing to eat. Famished with hunger, he will start to chew on his own tail, and then his writhings and convulsions will be so terrible that the whole earth will tilt, overburdened as it is with people and things, and slip into the sea. This legend mentions the serpent serving the creator god. This serpent resembles Ananta Shesha, who serves Vishnu as a bed and supports the universal structure. They are both situated at the bottom of the universe on the great ocean called Garbhodaka. Scandinavia The Norse Ragnarok involves the destruction of the earth and the abodes of the Norse demigods (called Asgard). It is said that during Ragnarok the world is destroyed with flames by a being called Surt, who lives beneath the lower world (appropriately called Hel) and was involved in the world's creation. By comparison, the Bhagavata Purana (3.11.30) states that at the end of Brahma's day, “the devastation takes place due to the fire emanating from the mouth of Sankarshana.” Sankarshana (Ananta Shesha) is a plenary expansion of Krishna who is “seated at the bottom of the universe” (Bhagavata Purana 3.8.3), beneath the lower planetary systems. More connections to the Vedic tradition can be found in the Norse lore, but they go beyond the present topic. Tibet Tibetan Buddhist perspective of the Nagas comes from Cho-Yang's “Year of Tibet Edition.” “Among all the creatures of the six realms, humans are the most fortunate, and have the best opportunity for attain- ing the ultimate achievement. Gods and demi-gods dwell in immeasurable happiness, exhausting the fruits of their positive karma, and are too distracted with worldly pleasure to seek liberation from cyclic existence. Hungry ghosts and hell beings are too disturbed with suffering and animals are too dumb. Humans, who enjoy both pleasure and pain are the only ones who can seek liberation. (...) “Unseen forces are believed to be as numerous as those we can see: in every pond, forest, tree, house, dwell creatures big and small, important and humble which occasionally appear to humans in various forms, as well as in visions and in dreams. “All these creatures are believed to be ruled by the protectors of the ten directions. These deities include gods from the Hindu pantheon such as Brahma and Indra. They are gods, and though they are immensely powerful and believed to control all the forces of the universe they are not beyond the wheel of cyclic existence and thus cannot be an object of refuge for humans aspiring for liberation. They may or may not be sympathetic to the Buddhist doctrine, but their help and cooperation can be cultivated and is considered essential, since they control all other non-human creatures, gods, demi-gods and ghosts. Tantric rituals always include an offering to them at the beginning to assure their non-interference. “The creatures dwelling in individual places are called Sa-dag or land owners, or guardian deities. They belong to the realm of demi-gods or ghosts - not all ghosts are miserable creatures, some are wealthy and powerful demons. They may appear to people as ghosts, demons, or in dreams in an infinite variety of forms, including the human one and may either help or harm depending on their disposition. Many of the creatures in lakes, ponds and rivers are nagas, or serpent beings who belong to the animal realm. They sometimes appear in the form of snakes, or as half snakes and half humans with elaborate jeweled"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 307 Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents crowns. They are believed to be infinitely wealthy and to owe their present form to a previous life of unethical generosity. [Comment: This is called bhogonmukhi-sukrti, or pious activities that bestow material opulence. They are of godless nature but involve kindness to other beings, with a view toward material happiness.] “Human activity is bound to encroach on the well-being of living creatures including those of other realms. Coming to a plot of land and inadvertently building a house, cutting trees or mining and digging natural resources will upset nagas and sa-dags just as it does animals and insects in such a situation. It is said that sa-dags and nagas equate the unauthorized use of land and natural resources they occupy to pil- fering their personal possessions. The weaker ones among them will undergo great hardship or die off, while the more powerful will react with anger and strike back at the offenders, inflicting disease, death, and sudden catastrophe. They will not necessarily strike at the humans having committed the harm, as most cannot identify the actual offenders, but at any human they see, and innocent people may fall ill or die for no apparent reason, or the whole area be affected with epidemics or cases of leprosy. “The following story was related by a Dema Locho Rinpochey, from Drepung, and occurred in the 1950s in Tibet. One day, one of the monks who was responsible for having the trees in the debating square watered, developed a large sore on his thigh. Suspecting it was caused by harm from nagas, he asked Rinpochey to consult an oracle in a nearby village - a nun who was possessed by nagas - to find out the cause of his illness. The naga, speaking through the oracle admitted having caused the harm: 'Yes, it was I who struck at that monk.' When Rinpochey asked the reason, it replied: 'I was angry at humans for other reasons and I saw this monk's luck was down and that he was vulnerable, so I caused him to develop this sore'. “Humans are most vulnerable to nagas and sa-dags when their luck is low, as it is said that any weak- ness is immediately apparent to these other-worldly creatures. In order to avert unlucky circumstances which may bring one harm, people hang up strings of different prayer flags bearing the image of a horse. The 'wind-horse' or Lung-ta is the symbol of one's luck. The Tibetan expression 'His wind-horse is running' or 'is broken' refers to this luck, and the prayer flags fluttering in the wind, a tradition of Bon origin, is believed to give the upper hand to one's wind-horse. “Since humans cannot survive without some form of land exploitation and building, Tibetans take cer- tain measures to prevent unnecessary mishaps. While the hanging of prayer flags is like a general pre- ventive measure, that of avoiding harm which has no direct cause, more particular measures are sought when any kind of digging is involved. Whenever choosing a site for building, whether for a mandala, temple or house, a lama is consulted as to the method by which the nagas and sa-dag on the site might be appeased and treated. The lama will know something about them either through dreams, divination or clairvoyance. According to Buddhist tantric practice, there are other ways of performing rituals. These are: peaceful, increasing, forceful and wrathful.The methods that apply to pacifying creatures of other realms are peaceful and wrathful, and the rituals used are extremely varied, in type as well as in tradition.” “Generally, in either case, a ritual based on sutra called Tashi Sojong is performed, to bring good luck and please the dwellers. If performing tantric rituals, the lama will offer tormas to the sa-dag or nagas abiding on the land. Tormas are conical-shaped offering cakes which have been blessed in three ways by a highly realized being by mantras, where they are purified from any defilements of ordinariness, by meditational stabilization, by which they are made infinite and by gestures, or mudras, which ensure that the recipient is satisfied. The idea of this ritual is to offer gifts to the sa-dag and nagas in exchange for use of their land. It is a deal, a give and take situation like selling a house, and if the 'sellers' are sat- isfied, things will proceed smoothly. There are some situations, however, where the land may be owned by particularly powerful sa-dags, who will not want to give in to humans and will do their utmost to cre- ate obstacles and harm. Such places are known as 'rough'. The spirits and demons inhabiting them will be unyielding in their views and generally delight in causing harm to human trespassers causing illness"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents 308 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation and bad dreams. If the lama examining the land sees such a situation, he will either declare the site unfit for building, or deal with the situation using the wrathful method.” “Through the possibilities are vast, the most commonly used wrathful method for clearing a site from negative forces, is the 'throwing of ritual cakes' which is like using a bomb to send harmful creatures to another existence. The motivation of the lama is one of compassion, and knowing that the purpose of the project is beneficial one and that the being causing the harm is accumulating negative karma, he will actually help it by transferring its consciousness to another realm where it will be of less harm to other beings. Only a person with a higher level of realization is qualified to perform such a ritual.” “When obstacles are removed, the Lu Thaye, a very powerful naga believed to be constantly moving under the ground is dealt with. Sudden digging would disturb him, but his movements in a particular spot can be plotted astrologically, and a spot on the plot can be found where no part of his body would be present at the time of the first, symbolic digging. This would be followed by offerings of ritual cakes to pacify him. This done, the building could proceed without further interference. “In some cases, sa-dags and nagas not only take offense at encroachment on their land, but at harm inflicted on certain animals they feel are their own. The following is a story which took place about eighty years ago in a remote area of Kham. The head of a group of nomads, feeling he was above the law against hunting wild animals which prevailed in his land, one day decided to go shooting. He went off with his rifle and spotted a beautiful stag. He aimed at it, and saw something like a golden stirrup between its antlers. He put down his rifle and stared, but could see nothing. He aimed and put down his rifle two or three times, seeing the stirrup appear and disappear, hesitated, and finally shot. The stag was hit by the bullet but escaped, leaving a trail of blood. That night, the man returned home, unable to find the carcass of the animal he had hoped to kill and suddenly became very ill. As he lay dying, he related to his kin the incident with the stag, regretting he had shot it and mumbling he should have known bet- ter, seeing such an unusual object as a golden stirrup between its antlers. He died that very night and his family concluded he was the victim of a revengeful sa-dag to whom either the stag belonged to or of which he had taken the form. “Incense and vase-offering rituals, which were routinely performed by the Tibetan government and also by private individuals and lamas were not only meant as a remedy in case of drought or other calami- ties, but also as a regular preventive measure to bring about positive conditions. Non-human creatures were known for their liking of fragrant smells, and the tradition of sang-so, which was originally prac- tised by the Bon to appease and please local deities, was later practised by Buddhists for the same pur- pose. In the case of vase-offering rituals, vases were filled with different precious metals and cereals, blessed by mantras, meditative stabilization and gestures and placed in lakes or other places throughout the country where nagas were known to dwell, as a boon to them. These gifts could be likened to pre- sents offered by the king of one country to that of another, aimed at pleasing the recipients who recipro- cated with timely rain, pure water and a disease free environment. They had ways of showing their liking in particular ways. Dema Locho Rinpochey recalls a time when Drepung Loseling college decided to renovate a small retreat house on one of their estates, a few hours from Lhasa. The place had a spring and was known for its important naga and sa-dag population. The college called on Rinpochey to perform a ritual to keep the nagas out of the way during the time of the restoration work. This involved attracting them into a mirror which was transformed, by the lama's concentration, into a very pleasant abode in which they were asked to remain, as honoured guests, until their usual dwelling was once more fit to stay in. Rinpoche also offered a bathing ritual to the spring, purifying any defilements it would have undergone during the work. He said that the next morning, the caretaker pointed out that the water was much more abundant than usual, a sign that the nagas who dwelled in it were pleased.”"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 309 Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents Serpent in Scriptural Accounts Middle East “The possibility that an ancient reptilian-saurian race may exist below the surface of this planet is not an idea which is relatively new. This infernal yet physical race has been referred to in spiritual and histori- cal records which date back to the beginning of time. Ancient Hebrew history, for instance, records that our human ancestors were not the only intelligent, free-will beings who inhabited the ancient world. Genesis chapter 3 refers to the “Serpent,” which according to many ancient Hebrew scholars was identi- fied with a hominoid or bi-ped reptilian being. The ancient Hebrew word for “Serpent” is “Nachash” (which according to Strong's Comprehensive and other Biblical concordances contained in itself the meanings: Reptile, Enchantment, Hissing, Whisper, Diligently Observe, Learn by Experience, Incanta- tion, Snake, etc., all of which may be descriptive of the serpent-sauroid race which we have been refer- ring to). The original “Nachash” was not actually a “snake” as most people believe, but actually an extremely intelligent, cunning creature possessed with the ability to speak and reason. It also stood upright as we've said, as did many of it's descendants, the small “saurian” predators which ambled about on two legs.” (from “The Cult of the Serpent” file, edited by Branton) In the book of Genesis Elohim punished the Serpent for deceiving Eve by ordering him to crawl on his stomach from that time on. They (Elohim) also created enmity between human and serpent race. The book of Revelation describes eschatological accounts when the enmity between human and serpent race escalates into an open conflict: “...And there was war in heaven: Michael fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels... and the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world...” (Rev. 12:7) There are other interesting biblical references to serpents and dragons in Psalms 44:19, 74:13, 148:7, Isaiah 13:22, etc. India: Nagas of the Underworld The Nagas are a race of serpent beings. Most often they manifest themselves with half-man, half-ser- pent bodies, although sometimes they assume the shape of a dragon, or appear in the guise of a cobra. They can take many different forms including snakes, humans with snake tails and normal humans, often beautiful maidens. A precious gem is embedded in their heads endowing them with supernatural powers including invisibility. Some are demoniac, some neutral or sometimes helpful. Nagas are divided into four classes: heavenly, divine, earthly or hidden, depending upon their function in guarding the heavenly palace, bringing rainfall, draining rivers or guarding treasures. In Burma, the Nagas combine elements of the dragon, snake and crocodile. They have guarded and pro- tected several royal Burmese personages. They also give rubies to those they favor. They inhabit lakes and rivers, but their real domain is a vast underground region called Bila-svarga, or subterranean heavens. There they guard great amounts of jewels and precious metals. Here they dwell with their seductive mates, the Naginis who sometimes seduce humans. One such account is to be found for example in the Mahabharata. Arjuna, the son of King Pandu, was “abducted” by Ulupi, the Naga princess who enamored him, into the parallel realm in the river Ganges near Hardwar. After spending a night with her and begetting a son called Iravan, he returned back. This incident is also mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana 9.22.32. R. Thompson in his book “Alien Identities” uses this account to give an example of parallel dimensions."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents 310 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation The Mahabharata “When his residence was thus crowded with divinity, the darling son of Pandu and Kunti then went down into the Ganges water, to be consecrated for holy rite. Taking his ritual bath and worshiping his forefathers, Arjuna, happy to take his part in the rite of fire, was rising out of the water, O king, when he was pulled back in by Ulupi, the virgin daughter of the serpent king, who could travel about at her will and was now within those waters. Holding onto him, she pulled him down into the land of the Nagas, into her father's house.” “Arjuna then saw in the most honorable house of the Naga king, whose name was Kauravya, a carefully attended fire. Dhananjaya Arjuna, son of Kunti, took over the duty of the fire, and without hesitation he made the offering and satisfied the sacred flames. Having done the duty to the fire, the son of Kunti then said laughingly to the daughter of the Naga king, “Why have you acted so boldly, O shy and beautiful woman? What is the name of this opulent land? Who are you and whose daughter are you?” “Ulupi said: “There is a serpent named Kauravya, born in the family of Airavata. I am his daughter, O Partha, and my name is Ulupi, lady of the snakes. I saw you, Kaunteya, when you went down into the waters to take your ritual bath, and I was stunned by Cupid. O Kuru child, now that the god of love has stirred me up so, you must welcome me, for I have no one else, and I have given myself to you in a secluded place.” “Arjuna said: “Dharmaraja Yudhisthira has instructed me to practice celibacy for twelve months, and I agreed; thus I am not my own master. I would like to please you, but I have never spoken an untruth. How can I avoid a lie and also please you, snake woman? If it could be done without hurting my reli- gious principles, then I would do it.” “Ulupi said: “I understand, son of Pandu, how you are wandering the earth, and how your elder brother has instructed you to practice celibacy: There will be a mutual accord that if any one of us mistakenly intrudes upon the others during their time with Drupada's daughter, then he must remain in the forest for twelve months as a celibate brahmacari.” That was the agreement you all made. But this exile you agreed upon is in regards to Draupadi. You all accepted the religious vow to be celibate in relation to her, and so your religious vow is not violated here with me. “Your eyes are very big and handsome, and it is your duty to rescue those who are in pain. Save me now, and there will be no breach of your religious principles. And even if there is some very subtle transgression of your religious principles, then let this be religious rule, Arjuna, that you gave me back my life. My lord, accept me as I have accepted you, for it will be an act approved by decent people; And if you will not accept me, then know that I am a dead woman. O strong-armed one, practice the greatest virtue, which is the act of giving life. I come to you now for shelter, for you are an ideal man.” “Kaunteya, you always take care of the poor and helpless people, and I have gone straight to you for shelter and am crying out in pain. I beg you, for my desire is so strong. Therefore you must please me by giving yourself; it is proper for you to make me a satisfied woman.” Sri Vaisampayana said: “Thus addressed by the virgin daughter of the serpent lord, the son of Kunti, basing his actions on the religious law, did for her all that she desired. The fiery hero Arjuna spent the night in the palace of the Naga king, and when the sun rose he too rose up from Kauravya's abode.” Similar story is recorded in the Harivansha, which is the addendum to the Mahabharata. Yadu, the founder of the Yadava family, went for a trip to the sea, where he was carried off by Dhumavarna, king of the serpents, to the capital of the serpents. Dhumavarna married his five daughters to Yadu, and from them sprang seven distinct families of people. Kumudvati, the Naga princess, married Kusha, the son of Rama, as described in the scripture Raghuvansha.

Therefore, they are also called Mauneyas. (According to Hindu Dictionary by Manurishi Foundation, the Mauneyas are a class of Gandharvas, who dwell beneath the earth, and are sixty millions in number.) They were fighting with the Nagas in the subterranean regions, whose dominions they seized and whose treasures they plundered. The Naga chiefs appealed to Vishnu for relief, and He promised to appear in the person of Purukutsa, son of King Mandhata, to help them. Thereupon the Nagas sent their sister Narmada to this Purukutsa, and she conducted him to the regions below, where he destroyed the Gandharvas. (According to the Ramayana similar Gandharvas were defeated by Bharata, the brother of Rama, and Hanuman.) The ninth khanda of the Bhagavata Purana also briefly mentions this story. The Bhagavata Purana narration is based on the incident which happened to King Pariksit. He was cursed by a young brahmana to die within seven days as a result of a snakebite. The boy thought the king had offended his father, who did not welcome the king in his ashrama being absorbed in deep med- itation. Thus the king left after putting a dead snake on sage's shoulder. The king decided to accept the curse as a will of providence and sat down at the bank of Ganges to prepare for his death. At that time the great young sage Shuka, the son of Vyasa, arrived there and the king asked him to explain the most important knowledge meant for a person about to die. Thus the sage started to narrate the great Purana. As a result the king attained self-realization. His son Janamejaya, however, became angry at the serpents and to revenge his father's death he started a great sacrifice meant to destroy all the serpents but later he stopped it to please the sage Astika, their relative. (Astika's father was the sage Jaratkaru who married Manasa, the sister of the Naga king Vasuki.) The whole story is narrated in the Mahabharata, Adi Parva. The origin of the Naga race is described in the Mahabharata, Adi Parva: “Long ago, in the godly millennium, Prajapati Daksha had two brilliant and sinless daughters, amazing sisters who were gifted with great beauty. Named Kadru and Vinata, they both became wives of the pri- mordial sage Kashyapa, a husband who was equal in glory to the Prajapati. Being pleased with his reli- gious wive, Kashyapa, with much happiness, offered them both a boon. Hearing of Kashyapa's joyful intention to let them choose an extraordinary boon, the two excellent women felt an incomparable joy.” Kadru chose to create one thousand serpent sons, all of equal strength, and Vinata hankered to have two sons who would exceed all of Kadru's sons in stamina, strength, valor, and spiritual influence. Her hus- band awarded her only one and a half of these desired sons, knowing that she could not have more. Vinata then said to Kashyapa, “Let me have at least one superior son.” “Vinata felt that her purpose was satisfied and that somehow both sons would be of superior strength. Kadru too felt her purpose fulfilled, since she would have one thousand sons of equal prowess. Both wives were delighted with their boons. Then Kashyapa, that mighty ascetic, urging them to carry their embryos with utmost care, retired to the forest. After a long time Kadru produced one thousand eggs, O leader of brahmanas, and Vinata produced two eggs. Their delighted assistants placed the two sisters' eggs in moist vessels, where they remained for five hundred years. When the years had passed, the sons of Kadru hatched from their eggs, but from Vinata's two eggs her two sons were not to be seen. That austere and godly woman, anxious to have children, was ashamed. Thus Vinata broke open one egg and saw therein her son. Authorities say that the upper half of the child's body was fully developed, but the lower half was not yet well formed.” This son was Aruna, the charioteer of Surya, the sun god. His brother was the powerful Garuda, divine eagle, who became the carrier of Vishnu. Garuda is an avowed enemy of serpents who are his food. Krishna mentions him among the most prominent representatives of His power: “Among the Daitya demons I am the devoted Prahlada, among subduers I am time, among beasts I am the lion, and among birds I am Garuda.” (Bhagavad-gita 10.30)"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents 312 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Nilamata Purana, the ancient history of Kashmir, is centered around the original inhabitants of Kashmir, the Nagas. In the verses 232-233 it mentions their capital: “O Naga, the dwelling of the Nagas is the city named Bhogavati. Having become a Yogi that Naga-chief (Vasuki) dwells there as well as here. But with his primary body, Vasuki, protecting the Nagas, shall live in Bhogavati. O sinless one, you (also) dwell here constantly.” Bhogavati is also mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana 1.11.11. Its another name is Putkari. Bhagavata Purana gives the following description of Bila-svarga, the subterranean regions compared for their opulence to heaven (5.24.7-15): “My dear King, beneath this earth are seven other planets, known as Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala and Patala. I have already explained the situation of the planetary systems of earth. The width and length of the seven lower planetary systems are calculated to be exactly the same as those of earth. “In these seven planetary systems, which are also known as the subterranean heavens [bila-svarga], there are very beautiful houses, gardens and places of sense enjoyment, which are even more opulent than those in the higher planets because the demons have a very high standard of sensual pleasure, wealth and influence. Most of the residents of these planets, who are known as Daityas, Danavas and Nagas, live as householders. Their wives, children, friends and society are all fully engaged in illusory, material happiness. The sense enjoyment of the demigods is sometimes disturbed, but the residents of these planets enjoy life without disturbances. Thus they are understood to be very attached to illusory happiness.” “My dear King, in the imitation heavens known as bila-svarga there is a great demon named Maya Dan- ava, who is an expert artist and architect. He has constructed many brilliantly decorated cities. There are many wonderful houses, walls, gates, assembly houses, temples, yards and temple compounds, as well as many hotels serving as residential quarters for foreigners. The houses for the leaders of these planets are constructed with the most valuable jewels, and they are always crowded with living entities known as Nagas and Asuras, as well as many pigeons, parrots and similar birds. All in all, these imitation heav- enly cities are most beautifully situated and attractively decorated. “The parks and gardens in the artificial heavens surpass in beauty those of the upper heavenly planets. The trees in those gardens, embraced by creepers, bend with a heavy burden of twigs with fruits and flowers, and therefore they appear extraordinarily beautiful. That beauty could attract anyone and make his mind fully blossom in the pleasure of sense gratification. There are many lakes and reservoirs with clear, transparent water, agitated by jumping fish and decorated with many flowers such as lilies, kuva- layas, kahlaras and blue and red lotuses. Pairs of cakravakas and many other water birds nest in the lakes and always enjoy in a happy mood, making sweet, pleasing vibrations that are very satisfying and conducive to enjoyment of the senses.” “Since there is no sunshine in those subterranean planets, time is not divided into days and nights, and consequently fear produced by time does not exist.” “Many great serpents reside there with gems on their hoods, and the effulgence of these gems dissipates the darkness in all directions.” “Since the residents of these planets drink and bathe in juices and elixirs made from wonderful herbs, they are freed from all anxieties and physical diseases. They have no experience of grey hair, wrinkles or invalidity, their bodily lusters do not fade, their perspiration does not cause a bad smell, and they are not troubled by fatigue or by lack of energy or enthusiasm due to old age.” “They live very auspiciously and do not fear death from anything but death's established time, which is the effulgence of the Sudarshana chakra of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. “"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 313 Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents “When the Sudarshana disc enters those provinces, the pregnant wives of the demons all have miscar- riages due to fear of its effulgence.” “The planetary system below Talatala is known as Mahatala. It is the abode of many-hooded snakes, descendants of Kadru, who are always very angry. The great snakes who are prominent are Kuhaka, Taksaka, Kaliya and Susena. The snakes in Mahatala are always disturbed by fear of Garuda, the carrier of Lord Vishnu, but although they are full of anxiety, some of them nevertheless sport with their wives, children, friends and relatives.” “Beneath Mahatala is the planetary system known as Rasatala, which is the abode of the demoniac sons of Diti and Danu. They are called Panis, Nivata-kavacas, Kaleyas and Hiranya-puravasis [those living in Hiranya-pura]. They are all enemies of the demigods, and they reside in holes like snakes. From birth they are extremely powerful and cruel, and although they are proud of their strength, they are always defeated by the Sudarshana chakra of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who rules all the planetary systems. When a female messenger from Indra named Sarama chants a particular curse, the serpentine demons of Mahatala become very afraid of Indra. Beneath Rasatala is another planetary system, known as Patala or Nagaloka, where there are many demoniac serpents, the masters of Nagaloka, such as Shankha, Kulika, Mahashankha, Shveta, Dhananjaya, Dhrtarashtra, Shankhacuda, Kambala, Ashvatara and Devadatta. The chief among them is Vasuki. They are all extremely angry, and they have many, many hoods - some snakes five hoods, some seven, some ten, others a hundred and others a thousand. These hoods are bedecked with valuable gems, and the light emanating from the gems illuminates the entire planetary system of bila-svarga.” Divine Connection Serpents have their special place in most spiritual traditions (as already shown above) where they sym- bolize either good or evil. In the Vedic tradition they are inherently related to some of its most important personages. Shiva Shiva (“auspicious One”), is one of the members of the trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva). He is in charge of the material mode of ignorance (tamo-guna) bringing destruction of the universe: “Yamaraja said: My dear servants, you have accepted me as the Supreme, but factually I am not. Above me, and above all the other demigods, including Indra and Candra, is the one supreme master and controller. The partial manifestations of His personality are Brahma, Visnu and Siva, who are in charge of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this universe. He is like the two threads that form the length and breadth of a woven cloth. The entire world is controlled by Him just as a bull is controlled by a rope in its nose.” (Bhagavata Purana 6.3.12) His position is between the living beings (jiva-tattva) and the Supreme Lord, Vishnu (vishnu-tattva), in the category of his own, shiva-tattva. Shiva is usually depicted in painting and sculpture as white or ash-colored, with a blue neck (from hold- ing in his throat the poison thrown up at the churning of the cosmic ocean, which threatened to destroy humankind), his hair arranged in a coil of matted locks (jatamakuta) and adorned with the crescent moon and the Ganges (he allowed her to trickle through his hair). He has three eyes, the third eye bestowing inward vision but capable of burning destruction when focused outward. He wears a garland of skulls and a serpent around his neck and carries in his two (sometimes four) hands a deerskin, a tri- dent, a small hand drum, or a club with a skull at the end His paraphernalia symbolizes: moon - time measurement in months, three eyes tri-kala-jna (“knower of three phases of time - past, present, and future”), snake around the neck - time measurement in years, necklace of skulls with snakes - changing of ages and begetting and annihilating of mankind. His asso-"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents 314 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation ciation with the serpents is obvious from his epithets: Nagabhushana, Vyalakalpa (“having serpents as ornaments”), Nagaharadhrik (“wearing serpent-necklaces”), Nagaraja, Nagendra, Nagesha (“king of Nagas”), Natal (“mongoose,” one who is immune from the serpent venom), Vyalin (“one who possesses snakes”), etc. Shiva is the main object of worship at Benares under the name Vishveshvara (“master of the universe”). One of his features is time (Bhagavad-gita 11.32: “Time I am,” Bhagavata Purana 3.5.26-27, Brahma- samhita 5.10), the separating factor between the material and spiritual world (Bhagavata Purana 3.10.12) and a medium to perceive the Lord's influence (Bhagavata Purana 3.26.16). Shiva's female consort is known under various names as Uma, Sati, Parvati, Durga, Kali, and Shakti. The divine couple, together with their sons - the six-headed Skanda and the elephant-headed Ganesha - are inhabiting the Mount Kailasa in the Himalayas as well as the Mahesha-dhama on the border of the material world (Devi-dhama) and the spiritual world (Vaikuntha or Hari-dhama). In the Brahma-samhita he is said to be another form of Maha-Vishnu, and is compared to a yogurt. Yogurt is nothing but milk, yet it is not milk. As yogurt is prepared when milk is mixed with a culture, the form of Shiva expands when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in touch with material nature. Since Shiva and Vishnu are aspects of one God, Shiva occurs as one of Vishnu's names listed in the Vishnu-sahasranama. The original father, Krishna, says, aham bija-pradah pita: “I am the seed-giving father.” That pita (father) is Lord Shiva, Shambhu, and material nature (goddess Durga) is considered the mother. By their sexual union are all conditioned souls inserted into the material nature. The impregnation of material nature is wonderful because at one time innumerable living beings are conceived. Bhago jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalpate (Shvetashvatara Upanishad 5.9). In this way Shiva is connected with both creation and destruction. Because of his marginal position between material and spiritual realm he is seemingly full of contradictions but these are reconciled on the transcendental level. Ananta Shesha Some of the Nagas are many-headed. Ananta, also called Shesha, the king of the Nagas, has unlimited heads. According to the Bhagavata Purana 5.25.3, He is the source of Rudra, an expansion of Shiva. When Krishna lists the most prominent representatives of His power, He says, ananta casmi naganam - “among the Nagas I am Ananta” (Bhagavad-gita 10.29). “My dear Lord, at the end of each millennium [here Brahma's life] the Supreme Personality of Godhead Garbhodakashayi Vishnu dissolves everything manifested within the universe into His belly. He lies down on the lap of Shesha Naga, from His navel sprouts a golden lotus flower on a stem, and on that lotus Lord Brahma is created. I can understand that You are the same Supreme Godhead. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.” (Bhagavata Purana 4.9.14) Ananta is called Shesha as He is the residue or remainder of the universe during cosmic dissolutions. He is elaborately described in the Bhagavata Purana, 5th khanda, chapter 25. Ultimately He will destroy the world: “At the time of the final devastation of the complete universe [the end of the duration of Brahma's life], a flame of fire emanates from the mouth of Ananta (...). “(Bhagavata Purana 2.2.26) Sage Patanjali, the author of Yoga-sutras, is considered by some to be an incarnation of Shesha. He is the author of the Mahabhashya, the celebrated commentary on the Grammar of Panini, and a defense of that work against the criticisms of philosopher Katyayana. His name allegedly represents that he fell as a small snake from heaven into the palm of Panini (pata - fallen, anjali - palm). South Indian Vaishnava philosopher and spiritual leader Ramanuja (11th century) is also considered an incarnation of Shesha."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 315 Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents Balarama “The foremost manifestation of Krishna is Sankarshana, who is known as Ananta. He is the origin of all incarnations within this material world. Previous to the appearance of Lord Krishna, this original San- karshana will appear as Baladeva, just to please the Supreme Lord Krishna in His transcendental pas- times.” (Bhagavata Purana 10.1.24) “According to expert opinion, Balarama, as the chief of the original quadruple forms, is also the original Sankarshana. Balarama, the first expansion of Krishna, expands Himself in five forms: (1) Maha-San- karshana, (2) Karanabdhishayi, (3) Garbhodakashayi, (4) Kshirodakashayi, and (5) Shesha. These five plenary portions are responsible for both the spiritual and material cosmic manifestations. In these five forms Lord Balarama assists Lord Krishna in His activities. The first four of these forms are responsible for the cosmic manifestations, whereas Shesha is responsible for personal service to the Lord. Shesha is called Ananta, or unlimited, because He assists the Personality of Godhead in His unlimited expansions by performing an unlimited variety of services. Shri Balarama is the servitor Godhead who serves Lord Krishna in all affairs of existence and knowledge. Lord Nityananda Prabhu, who is the same servitor Godhead, Balarama, performs the same service to Lord Gauranga by constant association.” (Chaitanya Charitamrta, Adi-lila 5.10, purport by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada) Balarama appeared as Krishna's older brother and took part in Krishna's childhood pastimes in Vrinda- vana. He is the first direct expansion of Krishna. Balarama only had one wife, Revati, daughter of King Raivata, and by her He had two sons, Nishatha and Ulmuka. He is represented as having fair complex- ion, and clad in a dark-blue vest (nilavastra). His special weapons are the club (khetaka or saunanda), the plow (hala), and the pestle (musala). Thus He is called Phala, Hala, Halayudha (“plow-armed”), Halabhrit, Langali (“plow-bearer”), Sankarshana (“one who attracts everything”), Musali (“pestle- holder”). As he has a palm for a banner, he is called Taladhvaja. He represents guru-tattva, the principle of spiritual master. “May the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Dhanvantari relieve me from undesir- able eatables and protect me from physical illness. May Lord Rsabhadeva, who conquered His inner and outer senses, protect me from fear produced by the duality of heat and cold. May Yajna protect me from defamation and harm from the populace, and may Lord Balarama as Shesha protect me from envious serpents.” (Bhagavata Purana 6.8.18) “The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Freed from all sinful reactions are those who rise from bed at the end of night, early in the morning, and fully concentrate their minds with great attention upon My form; your form; this lake; this mountain; the caves; the gardens; the cane plants; the bamboo plants; the celestial trees; the residential quarters of Me, Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva; the three peaks of Trikuta Mountain, made of gold, silver and iron; My very pleasing abode [the ocean of milk]; the white island, Shvetadvipa, which is always brilliant with spiritual rays; My mark of Shrivatsa; the Kaustubha gem; My Vaijayanti garland; My club, Kaumodaki; My Sudarshana disc and Pancajanya conch shell; My bearer, Garuda, the king of the birds; My bed, Shesha Naga; My expansion of energy the goddess of for- tune; Lord Brahma; Narada Muni; Lord Shiva; Prahlada; My incarnations like Matsya, Kurma and Varaha; My unlimited all-auspicious activities, which yield piety to he who hears them; the sun; the moon; fire; the mantra omkara; the Absolute Truth; the total material energy; the cows and brahmanas; devotional service; the wives of Soma and Kashyapa, who are all daughters of King Daksha; the Rivers Ganges, Sarasvati, Nanda and Yamuna [Kalindi]; the elephant Airavata; Dhruva Maharaja; the seven rshis; and the pious human beings.” (Bhagavata Purana 8.4.17-24) Although Garuda enmity toward serpents is known from this verse it is clear that both Garuda and Shesha Naga are servants of the Lord Vishnu, or Krishna."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"Appendix E: Dragons and Serpents 316 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation Conclusion Although this overview of the position of a Serpent in different traditions is far from exhaustive the con- spicuous similarity of accounts from different cultural contexts hints that the Vedic tradition spread in the distant past over large parts of the world. This is also supported by the tradition itself. In this article we have traced the Serpent in various traditions, places and contexts which ultimately lead us to the transcendental realm. On this level the duality of “good” and “bad” ceases to exist as every- thing is of absolute nature. This puts an end to the Serpent controversy.

Yet this is to be noted, that the dogs were not preyed upon, but slain and left whole: for his food is thought to be, for the most part, in a conie warren, which he much frequents; and it is found much scanted and impaired in the encrease it had woont to afford”.

It produces individualism that is immediately expressed as republican nationalism, dedicated to ending all hereditary control and dictatorship over the lives of people. The Renaissance Period becomes destructured again by the old families in Europe. England eventually becomes the source of the movement to destroy nationalism (initially through conquest and establishment of the British Empire) and individualism, expressed in the Communist movement. Eventually, two world wars would be planned to restore rule by the oligarchy. 1400 European power centers coalesce into two camps: the Ghibellines, who supported the Emperors Hohenstaufen family, and the Guelphs, from Welf, the German prince who competed with Frederick for control of the Holy Roman Empire. The Pope allied himself with the Guelphs. All modern history stems directly from the struggle between these two powers. The Guelphs are also called the Neri, Black Guelphs, or Black Nobility, and supported William of Orange in his seizure of the throne of England, which eventually resulted in the formation of the Bank of England and the East India Com- pany, which would rule the world from the 17th century. All coup d'etats, revolutions and wars in the 19th and 20th centuries are centered in the battle of the Guelphs to hold and enhance their power, which is now the New World Order . The power of the Guelphs would extend through the Italian financial centers to the north of France in Lombardy (all Italian bankers were referred to as “Lombards.” Lom- bard in German means “deposit bank,” and the Lombards were bankers to the entire Medieval world. They would later transfer operations north to Hamburg, then to Amsterdam, and finally to London. The Guelphs would start the slave trade to the colonies. The Guelphs, in order to aid their control of finance and politics, would perpetuate Gnostic cults which eventually developed into the Rosicrucians, Unitari- ans, Fabian Society and the World Council of Churches.

Over 220 people are treated during the first six months of experimentation. Only six had no apparent reaction. Mather was bitterly attacked for recommending this practice in Boston, Massachusetts. 1722 In Wales, a Dr. Wright refers to inoculation against smallpox in the British Isles as “an ancient practice.” A citizen of Wales, 99 years old, states that inoculation had been known and used during his entire lifetime, and that his mother stated it was common during her life, and that she got smallpox through her “inoculation.” 1723 Johann Peter Rockefeller arrives in the U.S. colonies from Germany. 1723 First record of smallpox immunization in Ireland, when a doctor in Dublin inoculates 25 people.

Weishaupt and oth- ers desired to attach themselves to Masonic lodges in Europe and America. In 1780, Weishaupt recruits Adolf Francis (Baron Knigge), which allowed the hierarchical structure of the Order to expand to com- pletion. Weishaupt sought absolute obedience to him and other influential members of the order, and worked for the overthrow of church and state authorities who were seen as blocks to Illuminati progress. Knigge completes the system of initiation, and membership swells to 300. Competition arises between Weishaupt and Knigge. 1781 American Congress meets for the first time.

This thesis is later discussed in 1918 with Stauffer's New England and the Bavarian Illuminati. Knigge was allegedly involved with both the German Union and the Eclectic Alliance, which was used as a cover for converting Masonic lodges to Illuminism between 1780 and 1784. 1798 Emigration to Canada begins. 1799 George Washington dies.

The Humboldt brothers, Stein and others divide German society into three distinct groups: (1) those who will be policy makers who are taught to think (.5%), (2) those who will be engineers, lawyers, doctors who are taught to partially think (5.5%) and (3) the children of the masses (94%), who were to learn obedience and how to follow orders. The school of the masses (volkschulen) divided whole ideas into subjects which did not exist previously. The result was that people would (1) think what someone else told them to think about,(2) when to think it, (3) how long to think about it, (4) when to stop thinking about it, and (5) when to think of something else. This way, no one in the masses would know anything that's really going on. (Although brilliant, the system is inherently negative in nature - it would lead eventually to German mind control paradigms in the late 19th and 20th century. The system also weakens or breaks the link between the child and the capacity to read (cross-assimilation creating whole ideas) by replacing the alphabet system of teaching reading with a system of teaching sounds, (breaking into smaller units). The same paradigm relative to reading is currently injected into U.S. Society by the Peabody Foundation, who imposed a northern sys- tem of schooling on the U.S. South between 1865 and 1918. The system in the northern U.S. is the Prus- sian system. Over 48% of the soldiers in the American revolution against the British, on both the American and British sides, were Prussian (German) mercenaries. 1822 The British government advances Edward Jenner another £20,000 for “smallpox vaccine” experi- mentation.

Western and European science focus on the conditioning stimuli. Soviet scientists focus on the aspect of external environment. Both aspects would later blend in an overall mind control paradigm in the latter 20th century. Heavy research would be conducted in Germany, which later contributed to development of a mind control infrastructure in the U.S. based on a mechanistically-based synthetic environment tied to body consciousness, temporal structure, drugs, and electronics. Soviet contributions would add to the molding of the underlying psy- chological substructure. China would also adopt the paradigm as a basis for control of their vast popula- tion of 1 billion. 1927 John Watson has achieved an experimental basis for the behaviorist school of psychology with his experiments in “molding the infant mind.” Using external stimuli combined with positive and negative reinforcement, Watson perfected a mechanistic method of mind control based on fear.

The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting of the fallopian tubes... three generations of imbeciles is enough.” They then sterilized Carrie Buck.

Concentration camps imprison German dissidents. The Republic of Germany falls to National Socialism. Hitler announces that communists have stated that England must fall before communism can succeed. Hitler vows to defend England, who had succeeded in lulling Hitler into a false sense of security until they could declare war against him.

The action was illegal because the U.S. was no longer at war. The Banking Relief Act of 1933 creates a wedge whereby wartime powers are sanctioned for use in peacetime. The Banking Relief Act declared March 6, 1933, a Bank Holiday order which relieved U.S. banks from their contrac- tual obligation to the people of the U.S. of redeeming their Federal Reserve Notes in Gold.

The only way to do business in the U.S. thereafter was to obtain permission from the state through getting a license. From this the Uniform Commercial Code would spring.

From now on, people are forced to mortgage property. All debt cannot be “paid,” but only “discharged.” The people become cap- tured chattel property of the U.S. to “secure the debt.” Former states become “political subdivisions” or occupied territories of the belligerent corporate United States. Americans are ordered to turn in their gold coins, bullion, other gold resources. During this period, over $114 million in gold was taken from banks for export, and $150 million in gold was withdrawn for hiding purposes. Gold at $20.67/oz. 1933 FDR announces decision to devalue the dollar by announcing that the government would buy gold at an increased price. Currency is now in the form of Federal Reserve Bank Notes (War & Emergency currency) and not Federal Reserve Notes (warehouse receipt for gold on deposit). 1933 Former judicial Courts of Justice take silent judicial notice of International Maritime Law In Rem jurisdiction and assume the role as Executive Officers (not judicial) to enforce the Federal and State statutes in all cases.

A large number of Germans involved in mind control work in the concentration camps are imported into the United States. One of the German imports would be a Hasidic Jew who represented the best of the Nazi mind control programming. He would be the one to develop the mind control operations for military intelligence in the United States, and is known by the pseudonym of cabalist Dr.Greenbaum. Imported also is the meth- odology for deliberately creating multiple personality disassociative states to further multi-level pro- gramming, using drugs, photic, and acoustic technology. Some of the German methodology for this has existed since the late 19th century. 1945 Reinhard Gehlen comes to the United States. 1945 Newburgh, New York, has their water supply fluoridated. Subsequent exams of the children by x- ray reveal that almost 14% have cortical defects in bone, compared to the nearby unfluoridated town of Kingston, where 7.5% have bone defects. 1945 As a result of government propaganda on fluorides, the ten year Michigan study was terminated after 1 year.

All children tested are more than 14 months old (not newborns). Eight infants had convulsions within 72 hours of the shot, 34 had convulsions within 28 days of the shot. British doctors denied a con- nection between the vaccine and the convulsions, declaring the tests a success and began administering it to all British children.

Louis Sauer points out that “the neurological damage caused by Pertussis vaccine is the same as the damage caused by Pertussis (whooping cough).” (Which is logical, because they use the bacteria in the vaccine). According to Sauer, “a customary prophylactic dose of Pertussis vaccine seems to illicit a chain of nervous system reactions and in some cases irreversible pathological changes in the brain. These findings resemble those encountered in cases of severe whooping cough (Pertussis).” In other words, the vaccine is causing the disease condition. 1949 Egas Moniz, the first lobotomist, receives Nobel Prize for Medicine in recognition for his “discov- ery.” (See 1935). 1949 AMA Council of Pharmacy and Chemistry goes on record to deny that dietary changes could have anything to do with prevention or treatment of cancer. 1949 Onassis buys the U.S. surplus “liberty ships.” 1949 A report appears in the August 1949 issue of Diseases of the Nervous System featuring research by Spradley and Marin-Foucher entitled “Hypothermia: A New Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders.” The authors note that the most complete investigations in the biophysiological field were carried out by German researchers in WWII, and discuss some 30 experiments done on mental patients in the United States. 1949 Air Force begins tunneling into Manzano Mountains to create underground facilities for nuclear weapons storage.

A military report noted respiratory problems. 1953 Allen Dulles becomes Director of the CIA. 1953 In the United States, Senator Charles Tobey begins a Senate investigation into the cancer industry. U.S. Justice Department attorney Ben Fitzgerald is hired as special counsel. Fitzgerald's report con- cluded that “the AME, in direct collaboration with the National Cancer Institute and the Federal Drug Administration, entered into a conspiracy to suppress alternative, effective cancer treatments.” Said Fitzgerald, “if radiation, surgery and drugs are the complete answer, then the greatest hoax of the age is being perpetrated upon the people by the continued appeal for funds for further research.” Senator Tobey is dispatched with a convenient “heart attack,” as has happened to others who threaten the cancer industry. Tobey's replacement, Senator John Bricker, orders Fitzgerald to stop the investigation. Fitzger- ald refuses and is fired. The investigation is halted and buried. 1953 Dr. C. Nash Herndon becomes president of the American Eugenics Society. 1953 Planning meeting held by Dulles, Ford Foundation director, Robert Hutchins, and Dr. Humphrey Osmond, personal physician to Aldous Huxley, for Ford Foundation-funded mescaline and LSD research.

Aldous Huxley, author of Doors of Perception , had a personal paradigm which"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 381 Appendix F: General Chronology of Events included the concepts of Dionysian “children of the sun” and an Illuminist-Osiris-Isis orientation. Aldous was also tutored by H.G. Wells, who was also in charge of British Foreign Intelligence in 1916. One of the curious books written by Wells was The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolu- tion . Huxley's initiation into psychedelic substance was provided by Aleister Crowley. It is thought by some that the British push of psychedelic chemicals on the United States is reminiscent of the paradigm of opium in China. 1953 Tavistock Institute, connected to the psychological warfare division of British Intelligence and funded by the Ford Foundation, British Defense Ministry, and Harvard University, sponsors conferences on such subjects as the “dialectics of liberation,” hosted by psychoanalyst R.D.

U.S. ignores data. 1953 The Swedish conduct a study on the Pertussis vaccine. Anna L. Annell, a Swedish researcher, writes a major work on Pertussis which indicates that “pertussis vaccine may be associated with the most varying kinds of cerebral complications which may be cortical, subcortical, or peripheral.” Encephalitis after vaccination is known to produce the same range of disabilities and impairment.

At the Fountain Hospital in London, Dr. J.M. Berg analyzed the 107 cases and found that 31 of them showed signs of permanent brain damage. Berg calls attention to the danger of mental retardation as an effect of the Pertussis vaccine and emphasizes that “any suggestion of a neurological reaction to a Pertussis vaccination should be an absolute contraindication to further inoculation.” The United States medical establishment ignores and suppresses the data. American physicians maintain that the damage caused is small compared to “lack of 'serious' reactions in children vaccinated.” No data has ever been found to justify a basis for this conclusion. 1958 Soviets on May 1 attempt to launch a mission with the objective of a lunar flyby or impact.

Montague, a medical doctor, published material reflecting his growing concern over fluoridation in the Journal of the International College of Surgeons connecting the pres- ence of fluorine in the human body to cancer. Also in 1958, an interesting piece of work was done by Dr. James Kerwin, a dentist, in which it was shown that the simultaneous presence of fluorine and stron- tium 90 in the human body may result in a greater accumulation of both substances in which compounds like strontium fluoride are formed. Because of the low solubility of these substances, the body has a very hard time getting rid of them.

It would have a great impact on the field of AI. Researchers turned their backs on conventional AI algorithms to build perceptrons and similar neural nets in an attempt to expand on pat- tern recognition capabilities. In the mid-1960's other work would define what perceptrons could not do, when Minsky and Papert publish Perceptrons: An Introduction to Computational Geometry. 1959 In the report of the proceedings of the 3rd Medical-Dental Conference on the Evaluation of Fluo- ridation, held on March 7, 1959, in New York City, the committee concluded that “It is apparent that the practice of fluoridation is not the simple, trustworthy procedure that the promoting authorities have given the profession and the public to believe.” Added to the lack of control of fluorides at the consum- ers tap are these major uncertainties: the gross variation in individual water consumption, the varied intake of fluorides in food and the fluoride intake from atmospheric and occupational exposure. These unpredictable issues make meaningless any talk about “controlled individual fluorine intake.” Most, if not all of this research has been buried by the authorities, who maintain glibly that “fluoride compounds are safe in the water supply.”"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 385 Appendix F: General Chronology of Events 1959 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers begins a three year period of publishing manuals entitled Design of Underground Installations in Rock. 1959 The United States never conducts its own clinical trials on Pertussis vaccine, but instead relies (as it still does today) on data collected by Britain's Medical Research Council in clinical trials in England in the 1950's for “proof of vaccine safety and effectiveness in newborns and children.” Interestingly, Britain’s trials on 50,000 British children were performed on children more than 14 months old.

Ebert that was published in 1959 on the metabolic pathways by which organs in an embryo are formed. In low concentrations, he found that sodium fluoride blocked almost completely the regions destined to form muscle, primarily affecting the heart muscle. In higher concentrations, it caused the entire embryo to disintegrate in a clear-cut pattern, starting with the heart-forming region. 1959 As early as 1959, the knowledge existed that the presence of fluoride in human bodies hastens the absorption of radioactive substances present in the environment. In a report to the Atomic Energy Com- mission's Division of Biology and Medicine entitled “The Metabolism of Alkaline Earth Metals by Bone” by F.W. Lengemann, professor of chemistry at the University of Tennessee on March 23, 1959, it was scientifically shown that the presence of fluorine and other environmental substances such as lead and cyanide in the human body increased the ratio of strontium 90 to calcium in bone. 1959 Manchurian Candidate published on brainwashing and mind control. 1959 The Soviet Union launches the Sputnik into orbit around the Earth, using technology gleaned from Germany during WWII in combination with their own.

In defense of the use of toxic fluoride compounds in public water supplies (which is a grievous crime against humanity, since it means mandated involun- tary public medication), they used the logic that “people have been known to live to a ripe old age” in areas where the water supply is fluoridated. Unfortunately, they neglected to mention that the addition of fluoride to the water supply correlated directly with the number of still births, mongoloid children, brittle teeth, and enlarged dental root structures, adverse spinal conditions, osteomalacia (softening of the bones), and osteoporosis (abnormally porous and spaced structure inside bone) in the medicated population as opposed to control populations that were unmedicated. 1960 Nobel Prize to Burnet & Medawar for discovery of acquired immunity against foreign tissue. 1960 School boards number 30,000 in the U.S. (See 1932 and 1990) 1960 Journal of Medical Science, Vol. 106, April 1960, publishes an article by Ewen Cameron, Leonard Levy and Leonard Rubenstein entitled “Effects of Repetition of Verbal Signals Upon the Behavior of Chronic Psychoneurotic Patients.” (Psychic driving process worked on by Cameron at CIA sponsored research facilities).

The quantity of fluorine deposition was parallel with the progression of the calcification. They also proved that the deposit of fluorine on teeth and bones starts through the placenta as early as the embryo period, and then takes place through the mothers milk through the infancy period, and through food, as well as directly through the inside of the oral cavity. As fluorine is a known active enzyme poison, it is known to affect cell division (mitotic) in the fetus, resulting in ana- tomical anomalies (teratism). 1960 National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) created to manage spy satellites. 1960 From 1960 to 1973, the U.S. sells Russia vast quantities of equipment. 1960 Captain Edward Ruppelt mysteriously dies of heart attack. 1960 Project Aquarius initiated to collect ET technical information. 1960 Canada begins to irradiate potatoes. 1960 John D.

BATCH CONSIGNMENT. 1961 In Great Britain, Dr. R.A.Holman of the Royal Institute of Pathology discussed fluoride poisoning in an article in the April 15, 1961 issue of the British Medical Journal. He noted that the long-term effects of sodium fluoride ingestion needed much more investigation, and continued, “Fluoride is a well-known inhibitor of several enzyme systems, and can form spectroscopically recognizable com- pounds with the enzyme catalase, resulting in its inhibition.” Catalase poisoning has been linked with the development of viruses and the causation of a number of diseases, including cancer. Many observers have suggested that the agents (fluorides and other toxic environmental substances) which decrease the catalase the cells may predispose those cells to tumor formation. Voisin has said, “the method most likely to solve the problem of cancer is to ask why the cancer cell is lacking in catalase and try to pre- vent its impoverishment from taking place.” 1961 Request goes in for production of the Iron Mountain Report on the Desirability of Peace. Public Law 87-297 passed (Arms Control Act), providing for gradual disarmament of the people of the United States over a period of years and creation of a UN Police Force. War is viewed as the “basic social sys- tem,” within which others are secondary modes of organization, conflict or conspiracy. Peace would bring unrivaled social disruption, according to world planners. War is considered a necessary waste that operates outside the normal economic “supply and demand” system. It creates artificial demand and spurs technological advances. War=Nations. Peace = No Nations. The elimination of war requires elim- ination of Nation States. The basic authority of the modern state over its people resides in its war pow- ers. (See FDR 1933). Substitutes for war: (1) Must be of equal magnitude as that of world war in terms of public perceptibility. (2) It must be credible and accepted by the vast majority. Since nations would disintegrate without perception of an external threat, “it is more probable that such a threat will have to be invented, rather than developed from unknown sources.” (Invented = Environmental pollution, “alien invasion,” “asteroids,” etc.). It must represent a threat to the survival of the species. According to the Report From Iron Mountain, “poisoning of the air, and of the principle sources of food and water supply, is already well advanced, and at first glance would seem promising in this respect. It will be a generation to a generation and a half before environmental pollution will be sufficiently menacing to offer a possible basis for a solution.” (1991). 1961 Blueprint For World Peace issued by the United Nations, providing an outline for “general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world” and a 3-stage Disarmament Plan to transfer all military forces on the planet into a UN Peacekeeping Force. 1961 Milgram's Yale experiments demonstrates danger of obedience to authority. 1961 Unexpected transmissions from space monitored on short wave worldwide. 1961 John F.

Developed by James Rand and Ernest Ayre, a recognized cancer specialist. The Rand vaccine produced significant improvement in terminal patients in over 30% of patients. It cured tumors and breast cancer in four to six months, without radiation, surgery, or chemotherapy. The FDA Commissioner was James L. Goddard, the same man who persecuted the use of DMSO. Goddard used the DMSO issue in 1966 in an attempt to foster a medical dictatorship in the U.S. in collusion with the medical and pharmaceutical industries, and remove viable treatments from public access. 1967 At the Bland-Sutton Institute of Middlesex Hospital in London, George Dick writes, “it has been long known that increasing the number of Pertussis bacteria per dose of vaccine increases the frequency of reactions. It would be surprising if decreasing the size of the infants receiving a particular vaccine did not also increase the reactions.” A violation of a standard axiom in medicine, which matches the size and weight to an amount of substance.

These disturbances include irritability, loss of memory, fatigue, headache, tremors, hallucination, autonomic nervous system disorders and disturbed sensory functioning. The report continues in discussion of several possible mechanisms which allow these effects. 1970 A companion paper, “A Direct Mechanism for the Direct Influence of Microwave Radiation on Neuroelectric Function,” is also produced by R.J. MacGregor for the RAND Corporation. In the report, he notes that power densities of close to 100,000 mw/cm2 can produce auditory hallucinations in a field that would be averaged as low intensity and non-thermal. According to MacGregor’s model, this would produce a depolarization of brain tissue of 2.0-3.0 mV, where he concludes that neuroelectric effects should exhibit a maximum effect in the microwave range. 1970 Due to the increasingly mild nature of whooping cough (Pertussis), infant deaths cease from natu- rally acquired Pertussis in Sweden.

Later in 1976, in Britain’s National Institute for Medical Research, the peptide beta-endorphin was isolated from the pituitary of a"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 401 Appendix F: General Chronology of Events monkey. It had an analgesic potency 100 times that of morphine and 40 times greater than enkephelins. Beta endorphins were split into Alpha and Gamma, the difference being only one amino acid. While Gamma produced a sensitivity to pain, Alpha produced analgesia. It was then postulated that Beta endorphins could act like a switch to balance reaction to pain. Lower blood sugar regulates certain neu- rotransmitters and controls certain hormones, all leading to certain behavioral effects from speed-learn- ing to flight-or-fight and pain suppression. So, schizophrenia at this time was diagnosed as typifying a de-activation of the beta endorphins. Beta endorphins have emerged as the most important element in the biochemistry of behavior. He who controls beta endorphins controls the mind. 1976 Low Intensity Conflict and Modern Technology, by Ltc. David Dean, American University Press, 1986, features an article by Capt. Paul Taylor, U.

These latent proviruses could be molecules in search of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple scle- rosis, systemic lupus erythematosis, Parkinson’s disease, and perhaps cancer.” According to Dr. Wen- dell Winters, a UCLA virologist who also attended the seminar, “immunizations may cause changes in the slow viruses and changes in the mechanism of DNA. This is being studied by Dr. Robert Hutchinson at the University of Tennessee.” 1976 Dr. Jonas Salk, creator of the polio vaccine, says that analysis indicates that the live virus vaccine in use since the 1960's is the principle, if not sole cause of all polio cases since 1961. 1976 More than 500 people receiving flu vaccinations become paralyzed with Guillain-Barre Syn- drome. 1976 Dr. D.

The coroner states he died “of natural causes,” even before the autopsy is performed. Bryan is believed to have been involved in the hypnotic programming of Albert De Salvo (Boston Strangler), Sirhan Sirhan (before the attack which led to Robert Kennedy's death), James Earl Ray (jailed for the murder of Martin Luther King), and other significant figures in history. 1977 Ray Ravenhott, director of the population program for the U.

Esterman entitled “The Master Plan.” 1977 The Congressional Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations convenes two full Congres- sional Hearings on the subject of fluorides. During the hearing, it was proven that (1) The “scientific efforts” of those promoting fluoridation were fraudulent, and (2) That other existing studies proved beyond a doubt that approximately 10,000 excess cancer deaths per year could be attributed to fluorida- tion in the United States. 1977 Congressional representative L. H. Fountain, chairman of the 1977 Sub-Committee Hearings on Fluoride, states that “the carcinogenic nature of fluoride remains unanswered” and orders the U. S. Pub- lic Health Service (U.S.PHS - who is in on the fluoride conspiracy anyway) “to conduct animal studies to see if fluoride causes cancer.” Dr. Herman Kraybill, from the National Cancer Institute (who in 1972 had been chosen by NCI to write a memo saying that fluorides do not cause cancer) was placed in charge of these studies. Kraybill boldly states, “this will be the final study to confirm negativity of fluo- ride ions in carcinogenesis.” He cites 13 studies having nothing to do with the subject of fluorides and cancer in order to support his claim that “no link between fluorides and cancer existed.” (NCI Director Dr. Arthur Upton later admitted the 13 studies had nothing to do with the subject of the study).

In 65 of those cases, reactions to DPT shots included convulsions, hyperactivity, and severe mental defect. In a stern statement, Stuart says, “it seems likely that most adverse reactions are unreported and/ or overlooked.” 1977 The British government conducts the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study (NCES) which tests the connection between vaccinations and neurological disease. 1977 Russia deployed charged particle beam weapon in space, upsetting U.

At the conclusion of the hearings, Rep- resentative Fountain and his committee instructed the United States Public Health Service (well known by now for questionable and dangerous medical advisory practices which benefit the medical and phar- maceutical industries) to conduct animal studies to “determine whether or not fluoride causes cancer.” As a result, the U.S.PHS retained Battelle Memorial Institute (also well known for NWO technical activities and is considered by many to be part of the cancer cover-up) to perform a study on mice and rats - unfortunately rodent physiology differs considerably from humans, making the transfer of data between species relatively meaningless.

The work is subsequently confirmed by Dr. Steven Edwards and co-workers from the University of California in San Diego, and by Drs. Froede and Wilson from the University of Colorado at Boulder. By distorting the configuration of the body's own protein, the immune system attacks its own protein, resulting in an autoimmune or allergic response. Fluroides contribute to the development of an Acquired Immune Deficiency Syn- drome, which is covered up by the media and medical community, which maintains a public focus on a viral cause for the problem, promoting the harmless HIV virus as the “cause” for “AIDS,” covering up the pharmo-chemical sensitization of the population which has complex legal ramifications. 1981 Larez does a study that shows that fluorides are teratogenic (cancer-causing) in rats. 1981 Montauk III Time Travel Project (until 1983).

At a concentration of .2 ppm (which is .8 ppm below the “approved” level of 1 ppm), relative white cell migration rate is reduced 8%. A concentration of 1 ppm would produce a physiological decline of around 10%. Fluoride added to water supplies, tooth paste, school dental washes, supplement pills, and dentists visits are increased and promoted, contributing to a further co-factor in the decline of the immune capability of the population. 1982 Bell Telephone agrees to sell 66% of assets after 7-year anti-trust suit. 1982 Magnetized tissues discovered in dolphins. 1982 Human insulin produced by bacteria is marketed. 1982 On May 15, 1982, CBS “60 Minutes” program details the vast numbers of Nazis brought to the U.

At this point, right wing military doctors are drawn to electronic mind control as a solution to the “useless eaters” quandary. In the introduction to the article, Scheflin states that “research designed to explicitly control the thoughts and conduct of citizens is in 1982 not only a reality, but the evidence is clear that this research is growing in scope, intensity, and financing.” 1982 The New England Journal of Medicine features an article in which an Air Force doctor states “if a criminal's brain waves did not test “normal” after five years, he should be put to death.” 1982 In Science magazine, Vol. 217 p.26-32, Dr. Dennis Leverett of the University of Rochester states, “if there are increasing concentrations of fluoride in the food chain, particularly food for infants, then we should expect fluorosis to be increasing in the population as well. The widespread use of fluorides might have created a situation in which we are approaching a critical mass of fluoride in the environ- ment.

Together with Elizabeth Raucher, Bise created an amazing demonstration that was video taped and nationally televised on October of 1987. Although nine hours of video tape was taken, only four minutes made it on the air. Four years went into their un- funded work, and the results speak for themselves. They had 300 human subjects that were tested under clinical conditions. Over 85% of them showed a repeatable response between an externally generated magnetic field and EEG brainwaves. Three male subjects were exposed to specific electronic patterns, such as spike waves, sawtooth waves, lissijous patterns, complex patterns like square waves with pulses, etc. In all cases they were correctly identified. This is not a statistical process. There was a med- ical doctor present in many cases. In one case, the doctor was supposed to be somebody from Army Intelligence, who said, “wow, this is really interesting.” They never heard from him again. The EEG documentation clearly showed pattern shifts associated with each change in waveform. There were dis- tinct signatures present in the brainwaves when the input magnetic field was shifted.

Interestingly, this work confirmed studies sponsored by the United States National Cancer Institute conducted back in 1963 by Herskowitz and Norton at Saint Louis University. More than 30 years ago, these scientists showed that low levels of fluoride increased the incidence of melanotic tumors in living organisms from 12 to 100% - often these tumors were induced by fluoride over a period of days. These studies were further ampli- fied by work done by the Taylor's at the University of Texas which found that 1 ppm fluoride in drink- ing water increased tumor growth rate in mice by 25%. 1988 Penthouse Magazine, August 1988, details seven scientists murdered in Britain who worked on Star Wars (cover for EM Mind Control) projects at Marconi.

A most curi- ous result of the study, from the U.S.PHS point of view, was that fluoride induced the occurrence of an extremely rare form of liver cancer, called hepatocholangio carcinoma, in fluoride-treated male and female mice. Two months later in April of 1989, Battelle released the results of its study of fluorides and rats. The study showed a dose-dependent relationship between the incidence of oral cancerous tumors and fluorides. It is interesting to note that mice and rats yielded different The results with fluoride—dif- ferent types of cancer. As a response to the Battelle study, the National Cancer Institute from examined the incidence of oral cancer in fluoridated and non-fluoridated countries over the period from 1973 to 1987. The National Cancer Institute study found that as exposure to fluoridation increases, so does the incidence of oral cancer; sometimes as much as a 50% increase in oral cancer rates occur in fluoridated areas—this translates to 8,000 new cases of oral and pharyngeal cancer per year, needless pain and suf- fering and a financial windfall to the medical and pharmaceutical factions that concern themselves with treatment."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"Appendix F: General Chronology of Events 416 Atlantis, Alien Visitation, and Genetic Manipulation 1989 Magnetometers at Corralitos, California, detect unusual ULF waves (.01 to 10 Hz) on September 12, 1989.

He additionally finds that a substantial number of children in fluoridated areas suf- fered from dental fluorosis. He makes the study public. 1990 U.S. House of Representatives introduced HR 4079 (Gingrich/Gramm), which declares a National Drug and Crime Emergency beginning on the date of the enactment and lasting 5 years. The bill pro- vides for the arrest of large numbers of people, incarceration in forced labor camps, suspension of “per- ceived Constitutional rights,” and no provision for humane housing and treatment. Assets would become bounty. Usual laws relative to search and seizure would be suspended for this five year period. All limitations on drug testing of individuals (except the President and Congress) would be removed. The bill targets drug traffickers and violent criminals. The effect of the bill would be to create a sub- society of mind controlled drones. 1990 La Prensa Dominical, a newspaper in Honduras (Jul. 22) reports that police in El Salvador had uncovered a child smuggling ring that was buying children for resale in the U.S., noting that 20,000 children per year vanish in Mexico.

Aquino is an expert in military mind con- trol, and has expounded on what he terms LBM (Lesser Black Magic) used in the control of popula- tions, including psychological operations and conventional forms of terrorism. He was investigated by military and civilian authorities on claims of child sexual abuse at San Francisco's Presidio military base. It is also curious that today, Mikhail Gorbachev, “ex” Russian KGB, has his office at the same Presidio facility. The Presidio is home for the Gorbachev Institute, where Mikhail writes books and does U.S. government planning for military base closures. Dr./Colonel Acquino has written on his theo- ries of mind control in an article which he submitted to the Washington Military Review, titled “From PSYOP to MINDWAR: The Psychology of Victory,” essentially a work on the usage of psychotronic (physiological-electronic) techniques, citing in particular the usage of air ionization alteration.

Essentially, this results in a denial or coverup of most reactions on the grounds that “there is no proof the vaccine causes brain dam- age.” They base their position on several studies financed by vaccine manufacturers conducted in the late 1980's by vaccine policy makers such as Dr. James Cherry and Dr. Edward Mortimer, who sit on the ACIP Committee and are also paid consultants to U.S. Pertussis vaccine manufacturers, resulting in biased and flawed studies in order to prove “no cause and effect” between the Pertussis vaccine and per- manent brain damage. U.S. vaccine policy makers are the CDC and the American Academy of Pediat- rics. All this, despite decades of experience indicating the opposite conclusion. ( Note : This policy constitutes criminal neglect, racketeering and conspiracy). 1991 Carl Campbell strolls to a Pentagon bus stop and shoots Navy Commander Edward Higgins, arms control specialist for the Department of Defense.

Robert Gallo and oth- ers base their theory of the HIV-AIDS link on purely circumstantial evidence: that this virus is present in some people who have a general immune dysfunction. Duesberg quotes statistics presented by the Institute of Medicine which shows that no more than 50% of American AIDS patients have antibodies against HIV present in their systems. According to Duesberg, “twenty-five previously unknown and in part unrelated diseases have been redefined as “AIDS,” provided they occur in the presence of HIV.” 1992 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) admits cases exist where there is T-Cell depletion in persons without the presence of the “HIV” virus. The admission is in the September 9, 1992 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). 1992 Vancouver Sun (1/25/92) reports University of California chief neurosurgeon Ronald Young as saying that a way has been found to focus ultrasonic waves so precisely that a beam can be directed into a living brain and halt the activity of clusters of neurons.

Jailed again for the same reason in 1994. Mirzayanov smuggled out information about the program that was published in the May 26, 1994 Wall Street Journal, which states that “the greatest results in the Soviet chemical weapons program were achieved between 1985 and 1991. Because the military disguises production of binary chemical weapons as use of “agricultural chemicals” and the West does not know the formula for the new weap- ons, inspectors under the Chemical Weapons Treaty cannot identify the components.” Apparently the Russians secured loopholes in the Treaty which allow it superiority in chemical weapons because the prohibited substances do not include those known in Russia as “substance A-230, Substance A-232, Substance A-233, etc. 1992 American Journal of Epidemiology reports that children die at a rate 8x greater than normal within three days of receiving a DPT shot. 1992 Four (4) cases of Diptheria in the United States. 1992 Virginia legislature passes the Health Care Decisions Act, which specifically targets patients in psychiatric or mental retardation facilities for extermination who have no “reasonable expectation of recovery.” 1992 General elections in the United States. 1992 William J.

After 6 months of stalling, the FDA admitted they had no data to show that fluoride tablets or drops were either safe or effective. They informed Perrone that they will “probably have to pull the tablets and drops off the market.” 1992 From 1988 to 1992, over $249 million has already been awarded due to hundreds of deaths and injuries caused by mandated vaccines. Thousands of cases are still pending. The permanent injuries from vaccines include, but are not limited to, learning disabilities, seizure disorders, mental retardation, and paralysis.

It is not unique to “HIV” retrovirus. The detection of “p24” is the basis for the ELISA test.

The most powerful of these cults was called the Stellar Cult, dominant for over 25,000 years. Christ and all original Magi were ini- tiates of this Cult, which gave mankind such sciences as: astrology, astronomy, and the Tarot. They were the architects of the great temples-structures, such as the pyramids and Sphinx. After the four great Cults became corrupted they eventually gave rise to the modern religions and political hierar- chies we all know today. Our world is still controlled by the elite families of these secret orders today. In this talk and slide show presentation, Michael will present information which will shift your entire view of how religion and politics work to shape the events of the world. Astro-Theology, the parent subject of common astrology and astronomy, exposes the occult roots of religion, government and big business. Knowledge of these roots will empower, inform and clarify your perception of the seem- ingly complex dynamics of the world. (Includes 600+ digital slides).

Why it seems as if you are always at war with yourself? Why, though you know better, you can't get better? Why you are sick, depressed or in a bad mood? Why you suffer and lose everything that is sacred to you? Why you doubt your own strength, abilities, and future, or even your belief in love and divinity? Why the evil flourish and the good perish? The phenomenon of the “Food-Chain,” is an accepted scientific fact. It cannot be denied how each species on this planet is dependent, for its own survival, on the life essences of other creatures that are natural prey. However, humanity has still to properly address the unseen and unrecognized truth of how certain predatory human-beings thrive off the energy and life-force of others of their own species. This fact is not acknowledged by the vast majority of healers, psychologists or even religious leaders. Hence the predators go about their nefarious activities largely undetected, and their victims fall with- out justice, or understanding as to what has happened to them. As Shakespeare warned: Humanity must perforce prey on itself, Like monsters from the deep . In Michael's talk, you will discover that what don't know can, indeed, harm you. He provides evidence as to why so many “messengers of light” struggle to survive as they attempt to serve the Holy Spirit, and why it is that, through the ages, spiritually advanced individuals experience financial, vocational and emotional crises that they cannot satisfactorily account for or remedy. Sharing a lifetime of occult researches, recent case histories, and personal experiences, Michael will provide you with the tools to identify the adversarial agencies, and protect yourself from subtle assaults to your psychic sover- eignty.

Exactly how this was to be achieved, however, was rarely lucidly explained. Christ implied that we have to become as a “little children” in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. Perhaps, part of this message was, that unless we are able to raise and educate our offspring holistically, such an exalted state will remain elusive. Perhaps, the fact is, that unless we are able to actualize “right relationship” with our children we cannot hope to inherit anything more than the per- verse and calamitous world we presently inhabit, and are apparently bequeathing to future genera- tions.
