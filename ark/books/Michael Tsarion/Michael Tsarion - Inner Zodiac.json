Those who would practice esoterically must combine and use the four Arts together. However, the exact man - ner in which this is to be done has not been of cen - tral concern to the vast majority of exoteric practi - tioners, “New-Age” dabblers, or so-called “experts” of the ancient Hermetic and Gnostic canon. The “glue,” so to speak, that holds the four great Arts together has been ignored and forgotten. It has, fortunately, been re-discovered and advanced in the Taroscopic System © , which synthesizes them all, as the Tarot’s Major Arcana, through its imagery and numerology, instructs us to do. In this regard, the Taroscopic System© signals a major revision of what we presently know about the Hermetic Arts of Divination. Of the many differences between Ta - roscopic and conventional Astrology, that of greatest import concerns the “Inner Zodiac.” Contrary to what is believed by exoteric practitioners of this ancient art, the zodiac is not an external phenomenon but is, rather, an inner psychic apparatus. It is an inherent attribute of the individual and collective psyche, an encodation in the genes, an eidetic image within our Race Memo - ry, and an archetype projected by consciousness. It is, therefore, utter folly to presume the zodiac to be purely external in origin. Thinking of the zodiac in this way is comparable to thinking that trees stand without roots or that skyscrapers tower without subterranean foundations. It is this egregious error that handicaps practitioners, believers, and inter - ested students, and which prevents the true and fascinating story of astrology from being told. A man’s destiny, they say, is written in the stars. All he’ll ever do, all he’ll ever love, all he’ll ever be... If this be true, as I now suppose it must, only one ques - tion remains: who does the writing? - (Introduction: The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde, Curtis Signature Collection) The story of astrology is truly magical since it contains the secrets pertaining to the mind/body split and the “I” versus “Thou” dichotomy. It reveals the secrets concerning the umbilical con - nection between psychic and physical energy and between microcosm and macrocosm. . ..astrology represents the summation of all the psychological knowledge of antiquity - Carl Gustav Jung 1"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2 Whether the origin of the zodiac is Aryan or Egyptian, it is still of immense antiquity. Simplicius (sixth century AD) writes that he had always heard that the Egyptians had kept astronomical observa - tions and records for at least 630,000 years...Diogenes Laertius carried back the astronomical calculations of the Egyptians to 48,863 years before Alexander the Great. Maritanus Capella corroborates the same by telling posterity that the Egyptians had secretly studied astronomy for over 40,000 years before they imparted their knowledge to the world - J. Lewis (Astron - omy of the Ancients) The Celtic Druids, Egyptian Magi, Native American Shaman, and members of the Lunar and Stellar Cults of the world understood the subtle relationships between noetic processes and physical events. They knew of the implicate order and that consciousness is capable of causing matter to alter its nature. As the supplanting Solar and Saturnian Cults rose to power two changes occurred which had very negative consequences. Firstly, the sun replaced the stars as the dominant principle of astrol - ogy; and secondly the ego became the center, or prime executor, of human waking consciousness. Consequently, as a result of these shifts in conception and psychology, the pristine precepts of astrological divination were ignored. The knowledge of the Inner Zodiac was lost and replaced by the preposterous theory which deems rocks floating in space to affect hu - man consciousness and destiny.

Such men turn away from the arcane sciences which might otherwise receive their positive attention and curiosity. The word “zodiac” (from the Greek zoon ) means “living creatures” or “living beings” emphasizing the fact that the true zodiac is within. If the signs of the zodiac are discovered to be “out-there” in the heavens, then they get there by way of human consciousness, by the psyche’s strange but scientifically acknowledged capacities for projection and inflation. In short, the round of the zodiac, the famous horoscope of twelve signs, exist above us as a omni-directional, cinema-like projection of the inherent twelve-fold plastic matrix that sub-divides the “Collective Unconscious.” As the twelve disciples of Jesus represent aspects of his own consciousness, so do the twelve celestial signs of the zodiac represent the twelve archetypal facets of our own being.

This explains the influence of the stars as asserted by astrologers. These influences are nothing but unconscious introspective perceptions of the collective uncon - scious - Carl Jung As we all know science began with the stars, and mankind discovered in them the dominants of the uncon - scious, the “gods,” as well as the curious psy - chological qualities of the Zodiac: a complete projected theory of human character - Carl Jung The idea is to demonstrate that the zodiac is an archetype, not only within the collective unconscious, but within the fabric of reality itself...as a ground plan of creation. This archetype has not been invented. It ex - ists, and knowledge of it has been developed in step with evolving human consciousness - Denis Elwell It is beyond question that the great ancient design of the zodiac is a wondrously conceived graph aimed to depict the structure of the Logos, the pattern or creative evolution, the essential constitution of the universe and the course of the current of life in the cosmos, and by analogy in man the microcosmic replica of the macrocosm...Man...was to fashion his new body of spiritual glory “after the pattern of the heavens,” the frame of the heavenly or zodiacal man, the primal Adam - Alvin Boyd Kuhn Of the four great Divination Arts, the Tarot is the most important and dynamic. It alone makes use of a rich palate of archetypal images, which resonate strongly with the deeper layers and dimensions of consciousness, and which, like mandalas or sacred yantras, serve as iconic guides on the road to self-realization and personal em - powerment.

Now, interest - ingly, the first card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot - the Magician , happens to depict a Hermetic Magi (Initiator) who is in the very process of unit - ing fourness into oneness. The Four are represent - ed by a Wand, a Cup, a Sword and a Disk, which sit upon his strange three-legged table. These ob - jects represent the four elements (Fire, Water, Air and Earth), the four suits of the Tarot, and the four modalities of consciousness (Intellect, Emotion, Sensation, and Intuition). And they also represent the four sister Divination disciplines which also re - quire unification. In fact, one may argue that if the tools are not first unified how can consciousness, which depends upon them for its individuation, actualze that rare state. When thou hast made the quadrangle round, Then is all the secret found - George Ripley (Alche - mist, 1490) ...the Kabalists hold that these four principles penetrate and create everything. Therefore, when the man finds these four principles in things and phenom - ena of quite different categories (where before he had not seen similarity), he begins to see analogy between these phenomena. And, gradually, he becomes convinced that the whole world is built according to one and the same law, on one and the same plan. The richness and growth of his intellect consists in the widening of his faculty for finding analogies. Therefore the study of the law of the four letters, or the name of Jehovah presents a powerful means for widening consciousness - P. D. Ouspensky The Tarot encapsulates many magical secrets.. The rich imagery of the Major Arcana has esoteric correspondences to the Egyptian, Hebrew, Celtic, and English magical alphabets, to the Kabalistic Tree of Life , the Chakra System, the Alchemical pro - cess, the so-called “Emerald Tablets of Hermes,” to sacred Numerology (Pythagorean and other), the physical orbit and movement of the luminar - ies and planets, the astrological phenomenon known as the “Precession of the Equinoxes,” to the process of Human Individuation, the yearly maturation of the human-being, the Personality Types, the zodiac, the sequential movement of the historical centuries (1st - 21st), the Periodic Table of Elements, and several other esoteric and exoteric phenomena. It without good reason that the sages of old referred to the Tarot as the Book of Life . In fact, when students of Alchemy are pontifi - cating about the mysterious “Emerald Tablets of Hermes,” they fail to recognize that these are again the actual Tarot. The antiquity of this book is lost in the night of time...And goes back to an epoch long before Moses...It was written upon detached leaves, which at the first were of fine gold and precious metals...It is symboli - cal, and its combinations adapt themselves to all the wonders of the Spirit. Altered by its passage across the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Ages, it is nevertheless preserved - thanks to the ignorance of the curious - Eliphas Levi As an erudite Kaba - listic book, all combina - tions of which reveal the harmonies preexisting between signs, letters and numbers, the practi - cal value of the Tarot is truly and above all marvelous. A prisoner devoid of books, had he only a Tarot of which he knew how to make use, could in a few years acquire a universal science, and converse with an unequalled doctrine and inexhaustible eloquence - Eliphas Levi The Tarot embodies symbolical presentations of universal ideas, behind which lie all the implicits of the human mind, and it is in this sense that they contain secret doctrine, which is the realization by the few of truths embedded in the consciousness of all - A. E. Waite (The Key to the Tarot, part II) T he Tarot can be considered to be one chapter, so to speak, of the greater Book of Symbolism. Its 78 pages of composite images, together with their geometrical, numerological, sabean, and Astro-Theological motifs, open direct ac - cess to the inner wisdom body, to the “Living Oracle” housed within the right-hemisphere of the brain. The means of entering into dia - logue with this Oracle involves the correct usage of, and meditation upon, iconic images, like those of the esoteric Tarot. The images on the Major Arcana cards, in particular, are figurative representations of numinous arche - typal concepts which provide the active link between man and world, consciousness and matter, and microcosmic and macrocosmic dimensions of reality. As the atom is to external matter the arche - types are to man’s consciousness. And arche - types, as the Alchemists of old understood, prefer to express themselves in images, colors, numbers, geometric shapes, and in musical harmonics and arrangements. This fact was more recently re-discovered and confirmed by Sigmund Freud, and Carl Gustav Jung, and 7 has been reiterated, more recently, by scholars such as Joseph Campbell and Leonard Schlain. True symbolism depends on the fact that things, which may differ from one another in time, space, material nature, and many other limitative charac - teristics, can possess and exhibit the same essential quality - Titus Burckhardt (Alchemy) It is the so-called “right-hemisphere” of the brain that possesses the ancestral program, so to speak, to decode and conduct these archetypal ciphers and transmit the subsequent gnosis, with its mysterious qualities, to the rest of consciousness for psychic and practical applica - tion. Unlike pedantic tutoring and instruction, the archetypes are personalized. They do not relate to, or communicate with, two people in the same way. Each “stereotype” (individual) is formed and shaped differently and is a unique expression of the archetypal matrix. It is this uniqueness that our modern, sterilized, techno- manic world seeks to erase. For all the erasure of ritual, in our present anti-culture the fact remains that we each have a different relation - ship with the color green than we do with the color red. We have a different relationship with ourselves than we do with other people. We have a different relationship to the air than we do with the fire. Contrary to what is commonly believed, however, wisdom is not knowledge. And we are not automatically distinguished by it after our life experience. Experience merely affords us the ability to finally realize the profundity of our folly, which is a great step for most of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 us. True wisdom, however, is not merely the realization of our habitual error. It is a quality that comes when our lives are in synch with the ever-flowing, nameless, ambient force which is without beginning or end, center or circumference, limit or boundary, and which is rooted in our innermost core, as the roots of great oaks are rooted in the external earth. The first step toward a relationship with wisdom is, as the Oracle said: Gnothi Seauthon , that is, to “Know Oneself.” And the first stage toward this state involves work with the High Arts of Divination. If these Arts were good enough for the builders of pyramids, the masters of the High Renaissance, then they are certainly good enough for the common man. Each card is, in a sense, a living being and its relation with its neighbors are what one might call diplomatic. It is for the student to build these liv - ing stones into his living temple - Aleister Crow - ley (The Book of Thoth) Unfortunately, due to generations of indoctri - nation and persecution, the inhabitants of the western world have been long suffering from “symbol illiteracy.” Communication in words, we have to understand, cannot lead us anywhere spiritually. Words are, phylogenetically, a very recent form of commu - nication. Moreover, it is only the minutest part of consciousness that chooses to expresses itself through language. It has been re - cently discovered that the human brain contains over 240,000 neural threads. That is enough to stretch from Earth to the Moon. On each micro-meter of these threads the data is stored as pictograms, composite images, and not as words. With the advent of verbal and written communication, humankind experienced a cognitive shift from the polyphrenic, holarchic mind to the mono - phrenic and hierarchic state known today. The mythographers behind the Judeo-Chris - tian paradigm saw to it that the word of God replaced the more antique image of god. They did this by placing the prohibition against “graven images” in the “Mosaic” Command - ments, even putting it before “Thou shalt not kill.” What are graven images? They are pictures of deity. They are iconic expressions of the gods (Archetypes). Ireland, Egypt, and India were covered in them and all ancient cultures understood that the mother-tongue, so to speak, of the spirit, was symbolism. They understood that the night sky was the tablet upon which the gods communicated to those below, to those initiated into the means of interpreting what was being transmitted. And God said, Let there be lights in the firma - ment of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years - (Genesis 1:14) In order for the Solar Cults to supersede the ecocentric, matrifocal Stellar and Lunar Cults there had to be an all-out prohibition against iconic images and the modality of cognition they gave rise to. Although the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"9 overt agenda was suppression, the covert idea was to appropriate the symbolic language of the previous Cults. The Churchmen wished to co-opt their Gnosis and weave it into their own nature denying religion. Without this deliberate theft of knowledge from previous theocracies it is doubt - ful whether the modern religions would have been accepted or endured. The Christian church is an encyclopedia of prehistoric cults - Fredrick Nietzsche The Judeo-Christian Old Testament , the tome of the phallocratic Saturnian and Solar Cults, is accepted to be based on the Torah. What is not commonly known or readily admitted, however, is that the Torah is itself based on the Tarot. In fact, these words are from the same root. They both mean “way” or “law.” They are also the names of the feminine goddess principle. Long before Isis, Hathor or Mary came on the scene, the original mother goddess of the Egyptians was called Ta’urt. Her main symbol was the hippopotamus of the Nile. All the mascu - line gods were her ambassadors and even Pha - raoh was her nominated emissary on earth. Later, as the cults and dynasties changed, the goddess Ta’urt became known by a plethora of other titles and names. She soon became known as Ma’at, Isis, Hathor, Sophia and finally as Mary the Ma - donna. However, the original Madonna, shown with her babe in her arms, was Ta’urt. The Tarot is named after her. It was considered her “Book of Life” written not in words but in images . It was this kind of hieratic, ideographic communication which the orthodox religions (the institutions of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity) were commit - ted to eradicate. The modern power-religions are founded upon the ruins and desecration of the ancient canon which once served as the greatest possible gospel, the holiest possible testament to the spiritual bond between man and nature. You shalt not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is under the water of the earth - (Exodus 20:4) The second Commandment forbade the Israelites from conveying any iconic information: no illustrations, no colorful drawings, and no art. So far as we know there had never before existed a culture that forbade representative art. Why should a prohibition against making images be the second most important rule for righ - teous living? ...According to the Ten Com - mandments, art, therefore, is more dangerous than murder - Leonard Schlain (The Alphabet Versus the Goddess) By the invincible power of tradi - tional subservience, the inertia of the general mind, enhanced by the gullibility of ignorance, the masses have slipped un - der the force of a victimiza - tion that is both pitiable and tragic...Religious thought has detached itself from nature and searches in the illimitable areas of feeling, thought, and won - der for what understanding these may yield it...Religion is not the realm of knowledge, or even of thought, but purely of belief, as for the masses...All this chaos in the religious area was attended, accentuated, if not largely in - spired by, one of the most stag - gering phenomena in the history of the race. This was - and is - the presence, power, and influ - ence of – a book! - Alvin Boyd Kuhn (The Ultimate Canon of Knowledge) It is more than sug - gestive that the prohibi - tion, in the Decalogue, against making “graven"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"images” comes before the prohibition against killing, implying that the creation of images is deemed by Jehovah to be worse than murder. The suppression of symbolic literacy was, to the Judeo-Christian Cults, an essential precursor to their monopoli - zation of thought and belief. It was at this point that mankind not only lost connec - tion with the flora and fauna, but with the inner “Wisdom Body.” The Bible and Torah com - municate through words, the Tarot through images. The former have caused humankind 2,ooo years of bloodshed and persecution for just that reason. Words are always open to mis - interpretation. Language and verbal expression varies enormously and conspicuously from one culture to another and are further constrained by both intrinsic and imposed context and structure. The greatest words, those writ - ten by the poets, are “great” because of their capacity to convey images. Images, on the other hand, are not so confined and, therefore, do not normally foster gross misinterpretation or zealotry. They are synthetic, mutable, anomalous, and crypt - aesthetic. They welcome multiple interpretations and lead beyond the subject versus object di - chotomy to the state of kata - phatic knowledge where the knower and the known are not polarized. When a mantic image or geometric shape is deeply contem - plated it has the ability to transmute consciousness from the “hylic” (base) level to the “phosphoric” (spiritual) level. It opens the consciousness to an - cestral Gnosis. This explains the Egyptian reliance on hierograms, the Vedic preference for mandalas and yantras, the Druidical oral tradition, 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11 and the Hermetic Tarot. The man who understands a symbol not only opens himself to the objective world but at the same time succeeds in emerging from his personal situation and reaching a comprehension of the universal...thanks to the sym - bol, the individual experience is “awoken” and transmuted into a spiritual act - Mircea Eliade Being symbol illiter - ate, as we are today, we are confined to mentation of the hyper-differentiated neo-cor - tex and “left brain.” Moreover, because we lack the empower - ment that would be ours if our unconscious minds were being accessed we are wide open to the many perni - cious subliminal messages which subvert the rea - son and which excite the primitive instincts. This influx eventually assaults our emotional well - being and causes psychic damage. A man under this kind of psychic assault is less likely to be guided toward his true life purpose. He is condemned to a life of reaction and addiction. In his malaise he is wont to react against his pitiful existential condi - tion in dysfunctional ways. He may blame god or he may subconsciously blame himself. He may strike out at the system or at others, or alterna - tively he may make the decision, subconsciously, to commit slow suicide through addictive behav - ior and lack of concern for his own spiritual and emotional welfare. The force we refer to as “God” commu - nicates to each of us every minute of every day. Our failure to attune to the guiding Voice within us ensures that we live banal inauthentic lives full of competitiveness, sorrow, and waste. Cling - ing to the socially-vetted roles and to the plethora of ready-made escapes from them, we fall victim of what critic Alexis de Tocqueville called the “tyranny of the masses.” Image-starved, we seek to alleviate our systemic impoverishment in a compulsive manner via addiction to television, video games, sports, pornography, advertise - ments, drugs, and virtual realities, etc. However, these bromides and panaceas provide only tem - porary relief. They may satisfy the wish-fulfill - ments of the lower man but can never wholly fulfill the void. They certainly cannot empower or lead to wisdom. The symbolically illiterate person remains emotionally and psychologi - cally arrested and is easily indoctrinated and controlled by the elites who own power depends upon the ignorance, support and complicity of the masses. Fortunately, there are remedies for our existential condition. Through the practice of the Divination Arts we open dialogue with the inner Wisdom Body, the “Living Oracle.” The Divina - tion Arts are our Western Magical Tradition. They bring back “the Magic” into our lives once we give them the energy they deserve. They inspire, unveil, and empower. But the esoteric secrets of each remained concealed until they are used together. There are many wrong ways and only one right way to do this. The Tarot contains indeed the mystery of all such transmutations of personages into sidereal bodies and"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"vice versa. The “wheel of Enoch” is and archaic invention, the most ancient of all, for it is found in China. Eliphas Levi says there was not a nation but had it, its real meaning being preserved in the greatest secrecy. It is a universal heirloom - Ma - dame Helena Blavatsky In a modern context, we can use the cards of the Tarot (or an Astrology chart) to help us demarcate the stages of the great “Rites of Passage” that occur throughout our lives. There are many such Rites and they cannot be avoided. They can be attended by periods of in - tense euphoria and considered peak-experiences. However, they can also be times of enormous emotional and spiritual challenge, when we are confronted by the resistance of authority figures or strange inner compulsions that disturb our equipoise and confuse our domestic and social interactions. The obvious Rites of Passage have been recognized by the mainstream psychologists and philosophers for some time now. They may include: birth, entrance to school, puberty, leav - ing school, the first sexual experience, the first job, marriage, giving birth, loss of a parent (or similar significant trauma), the astrological “Sat - urn Return,” divorce, menopause, retirement, and death. There are many others, such as the moments of betrayal, or punishment for mis - deeds, etc, not to mention the various euphoric experiences of a creative, religious, or mystical nature. Philosophically speaking, the Rites of Passage exist as unavoidable phases or stages of maturation of, and for, the ego. They are pe - riods when the “horizontal” axis of our ego-life (inauthentic existence) crosses the “vertical” axis of Self-hood (authentic existence). Each person’s ego-life has its own particular rhythm, move - ment, and duration. Therefore, no two people experience the Rites in the same way. The nature of a person’s ego and the form the Rites will take in one’s life are revealed within one’s Divina - tion Chart. Through the arts of Tarot and Astrol - ogy we receive invaluable instruction as to the kinds of experiences we will have when passing through these transformative phases. The insight that we glean from our Chart enable us to make the best of what we experience. We get a clearer understanding of what to expect and what the lessons will be. We get to understand why the Rites exist and what will be expected of us as we undergo these maturation periods. The indiffer - ent man who cares nothing for such empower - ment does not pass successfully through the Rites of Passage. He does not mature or evolve 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"13 and may even give way to fear and addiction in order to avoid purifying his psyche and emo - tional constitution. The indifferent man remains fixed on the hylic (base) level. The magic of life passes him by. The personality of a person is connected to the fate experienced. As the Greek philosophers wrote: A man’s character is his fate. It follows, then, that the more unique a person’s character the more unique their Individuation Process will be and the more distinctive the Rites of Passage leading to it. The process of Individuation was known, under other names, to the Alchemists and mys - tics of old. They described the process, figura - tively, as the “Quartering” or as “Quaternity.” It is the “Squaring of the Circle” of the Sacred Geometrists, the “Four Fold-Vision of God” to the Sophics, and the “Crucifixion” on Golgotha (Skull Hill) to Gnostic Christians and Druids. It was cryptically referenced in by Shamans, Brah - mins, and Hopis, and every enlightened civiliza - tion on the earth who maintained a strict reverence to the rites and rituals associ - ated with biological and psychological maturation. Those who have seen fit to ignore, marginalize, denigrate, and misin - terpret the Shamanic Way, and who have replaced it with anti- human ideologies, are responsible for undermining the inner con - stitution of mankind and for the ecocide which inwardly dirempt men frequently commit. The man whose inner nature is in tatters and whose emotions are mutilated is unlikely to act as the reverently toward the natural world he physi - cally sees around him. To such a man the natural world is perceived as a threat. The virtueless and psychopathic man is convinced that nature, which nature works against his best interests, is to be overcome and if necessary destroyed. Through circumrotation, or a circular philo - sophical revolving of the quaternity, it is brought back to the highest and purest simplicity of the monad. Out of the gross and impure One there cometh an exceed - ing pure and subtile Monad - Heinrich Khunrath (Alchemist, 1597) The suppression and negation of man’s instinctu - al nature and the lack of acknowledgement of the Rites of Passage have thrust mankind toward the precipice of psychosis and oblivion. As a result of the subtle artifice of those who prefer to have man exist as an narcissistic, addicted, dilemma ridden servant, we now have no problem finding millions of fear-ridden people prostrating their dignity and sanity before the sterile religions which, like dead suns in the cold wastes of space,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 offer neither light nor warmth.

You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to - (Matt 23) The Imitatio Christi will forever have this disadvan - tage: we worship a man as a divine model, embodying the deepest mean - ing of life, and then out of sheer imitation we forget to make real the profound meaning present in ourselves - Carl Gustav Jung According to Bishop Epiphanius, the Krist is the spiritual self within each person - Tony Bushby (The Bible Fraud) The Egyptians had no vicarious atonement, no imputed righteousness, no second-hand salvation. No initiate in the Osirian mysteries could possibly have rested his hope of reaching heaven on the Galilean line of glory. His was the more crucial way of Amenta...to tread with the guidance of the word, that step by step and act by act he must himself make true - Gerald Massey (Ancient Egypt - Light of the World) The Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks and Romans, had no word in their language for sin: the Israelites introduced both the word and the concept into the stream of Western civilization and by doing so diverted it - Leonard Schlain (The Alphabet Versus the Goddess) For the mundane and pragmatic Everyman the various Rites of Passage are experienced as un - comfortable and even alarming deviations from the clear sunny horizons which are the destina - tions of the amped up ego-drives. They are con - sidered obscene interruptions in the routine, or as punctures in the bubble of normality which is anything but. Due to these detours and times when the wires become crossed and frazzled we can find ourselves doing very strange things. The rules of the game evaporate or even appear gro - tesque during such traversals and our experiences from the past, like the advice of others, become as useful as sign-posts in a ghost town. The ultimate objective of any Rite of Passage is to provide us with the opportunity to quantum-leap from the “horizontal” sphere of existence to the “vertical,” that is, to change the road we are on and get back into synch with our higher calling. In mystical terms, we get a chance to make a proactive shift from our Karmic to our Dharmic life, from monophrenic to polyphrenic thinking, and from lower chakra to higher chakra drives. When we are ruled by Karma, ignorance is king and both death and the devil are constant companions. It matters little whether we consider our adversary to be the projection of collective ignorance or a red devil with two horns and a pitchfork. In the dark of the karmic life such matters are hardly a major priority. In the karmic life, as most can attest, there is scant protection against the storms of fate and the only reason why life carries on is that we learn train ourselves to sit quiet and accept the “rights” and “privileges” that our fel - low inmates, like “Olivers” with bowl, receive. When we are living our Dharma our lives are mutable, magical, and real. Bad things, so to"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"speak, may still happen to us and we will still know adversity. However, our attitude toward the vagaries of life is not that of the karmic man. Our per - spective and comprehension of what transpires is radically more mature and insightful. We are more than survivors; we are Creators . We oper - ate in the world as our own priests or priestesses, reinventing ourselves daily. We become our own teachers and are not dependent on the fragmen - tary knowledge provided by others. Our rapport with life, with god, with nature, with others, and primarily with ourselves, is radically deeper and more meaningful than others can ever guess. In order to actualize our Dharmic Life we will first have to endure many personal sacrifices. Major areas of our lives will undergo significant decon - struction and we will have to learn the difference between egotism and egocentricity, liberty and freedom, sanity and insanity, wisdom and folly. As Sophocles wrote: “Nothing vast enters the life of mortals without a curse.” The average Everyman may experience approximately seven major Rites of Passage during their lives. The awakened person can have more, while the symbolically literate and self-realized person’s life may be considered one continuous Rite of Passage. The round of the twenty-two cards of the Major Arcana demarcate and illustrate the strange and mythic journey of these particular types. To understand what it would be like to live as such a person would be to know and feel what the Van Goghs, Dalis, and Chopins of the world knew and felt, and what the Zambezi river “feels” as it curves over the precipice of Victoria Falls, plummeting and exploding into the deep, dark, churning basalt basins below. The men and women we tend to refer to by terms such as “genius” or “eccentric” are those who know very little of the horizontal mode of life. In the words of master musician Andres Segovia, their lives are an “ascending line” along which none but they can travel. What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny compared to what lies within us - Anonymous No matter to what depths I plumb, I always end with my wings beating steadily upwards toward the sun - Aleister Crowley Regardless of the nature or intensity of the Rites of Passage we are not condemned to go through them blindly and apprehensively. The four great Arts of Divination, when cor - rectly applied, provide us with the pertinent information we need to predict and com - prehend the variables, intensity, and impact of what we will inevitably experience. Our own responses and reactions can be foretold and, as a result of the insight afforded us, we can minimize the chance for wrong decisions and choices. By way of the Tarot, and its sister Arts, we can re - ceive clear information regarding the events, ex - periences, opportunities, relationships, obstacles, challenges, and warnings about to come our way before and during the Rites of Passage, These ma - jor turning points of life come and pass quickly and, once gone, they never return again. Life is, after all, like an invisible labyrinth in which it is very easy to get lost. It is imperative, therefore, that like Theseus we too have an “Ariadne’s Thread” to orient us during the darker moments and to guide us to our destination. When correctly constructed and interpret - ed, our Tarot Spread, or Astrology or Numerol - ogy Chart, becomes our needed compass leading us safely through the shallows and depths of the omnidirectional ocean of life. After all, as already stated, the zodiac and the chart are actually extensions of our inner consciousness. The Chart is the record of the advice we are being given by our own higher Guides. ...perhaps there is a pattern set up in the heavens for one who desires to see it, and having seen it, to find one in himself - Plato The Divination Arts, of Astrology, Tarot, Kabala, and Numerology are the only diagnostic 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"tools to provide coherent and invaluable insight into the Rites of Passages that we each will experience. They were in the world aeons before high-priced psycholo - gists and counselors who are good at the “patch-up” but are not much involved in the prevention aspects. These ex - oteric approaches can never replace the holistic Divina - tion Arts. In fact, exoteric scholars, in order to bolster their own artifices, con - tinually avail themselves of esoteric wisdom that comes from the arcane canon. It is an accepted fact, for instance, that psychologist Carl Jung had a life-long interest in alchemy and astrology. And in truth, both he and his contem - poraries (Freud, Adler, and Reich, and others) merely rediscovered the principles and archetypes that the Alchemists, diviners, and metaphysicians had employed for millennia. Freud and Jung merely utilized the language of science to eluci - date the timeless principles they were research - ing. Psychology text books of future generations will look back on the modern psychologists working without the aid of astrology as being like the medieval astronomers working without the aid of the telescope - Richard Tarnas Ph.D ..astrology represents the summation of all the psychological knowledge of antiquity - Carl Jung Learning how to create and interpret one’s own Tarot Spread, or one’s astrological (Taroscopic) Chart, is both enjoyable and empowering. Read - ing for others is also one of the best ways to re - ally serve humanity. Chart reading requires logic but also intuition and empathy. The Arts used are merely instruments which reveal the inner anatomy of a client’s psyche. They reveal what may lie hidden from their conscious minds. The Tarot, specifically, can be thought of as a cathe - dral. The individual cards are like the cathedral’s beautiful stained-glass windows; and the spreads are the “light” which passes, with varied intensi - ties, into and through these windows. The adept reader merely interprets these nu - ances and relates to the client what their own source is seek - ing to reveal. From the most mundane domestic issues to the great questions of destiny the Divination Arts pro - vide our answers and guidance. Simply put, our lives can be compared to a great and complex jig-saw puzzle. We are each committed to put the myriad pieces togeth - er and finish the picture. However, with any real puzzle we get, if we choose, to first see the picture on the “lid of the box” before we begin. Seeing the overall pic - ture is essential if we are to be fluent and expert at what we are doing. It is this “glimpse” of the cover of our life-puzzle that the Tarot and the other three Divi - nation Arts provide. From the intelligence they avail us, we operate more intelligently, and are masters rather than victims in this vast and complex game of life. If we are given even a second’s glimpse of the cover our hands will move faster and we will progress with confidence in the right direction. Every day we examine ourselves in a mirror so that we are physically presentable and dignified to the world. The time has come for us to use the Arts of Divination in the same manner, as mirrors of the soul, so that it can be presented to the world unfettered and resplendent, free, joyous, and wise; proving that the stars are not only confined to the heavens above but are shin - ing within us with a luminosity that no amount of ignorance, deceit, or sorrow can blight or extinguish. ..Each grain of sand every stone on the land, each rock and each hill, each fountain and rill, each herb and each tree, mountain, hill, earth and sea, cloud, meteor and star, are Men seen afar - William Blake 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"© 2006 Michael Tsarion www.taroscopes.com"}]
