So let's get clear on a few things and remain sane in the midst of growing worldwide insanity. Let's understand that the present day architects of control, those biological or ideological descendants of the Atonist pharaohs of old, along with their less camera shy lieutenants, continue plying their vile imperialist trade from behind the visible governments and religions of your world.

But did it wake you up? That is the question ( here ). Let's understand that the \"Israeli-Palestinian\" conflict is engineered from London and New York by elites with ancient origins. Age after age they concoct bogus conflicts to engender a permanent ambience of fear and paranoia, and to ensure few of you become aware of the real enemies of mankind. Those so-called Islamic \"extremists\" are funded by the same hidden hands that fund the Zionists and the Fundamentalist Christian Evangelists. Israel, dear people - the real Israel - has little to do with either religious Jews or the Torah, just as the true Christ has little to do with Vatican-style Christianity or American Evangelism. But you have not worked this out yet, have you? No, of course not. After all, y ou've have been \"Mel Gibsoned\" and \"Pat Robertzoned\" to death, and are mentally infected by many a deadly pathogen, the worst of which is ignorance . Happily the cure is on its way. \"Al Qaeda,\" your new bogey, is the brain-child of the same Vatican, New York City, and London based intelligentsia that once funded Hitler and his Nazis, that concocted the now shelved \"Soviet Experiment,\" that funded Franco, Pol Pot, Robert Mugabe, Batista, Pinochet, Noriega, and every other demagogue and inhuman tyranny throughout the world. The heat is being turned up \"over there\" both for ritual purposes, and to distract you from noticing the final demise of your once great country that has been scourged and raped economically and politically by its direst enemies, the legions of the British Crown.

For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions.

In the years 1919 and 1920, two events of critical strategic importance for Britain's opium war against the United States occurred. First the Royal Institute for Foreign Affairs was founded.

The creatures of death and decay are presiding because your world is dying and turning rotten. These misleaders are merely the maggots and parasites one would expect to find thriving upon necrotic tissue. They are merely symptoms and not causes, as you would so prefer to believe. We have lost our superstitious fear of evil spirits and things that go bump in the night, but, instead, are seized with terror of people who, possessed by demons, perpetrate the frightful deeds of darkness. That the doers of such deeds think of themselves not as possessed but as \"supermen,\" does not alter the fact of their possession - Carl Gustav Jung As babies you did not like being separated from your mothers. No, that was most traumatic. You did not like having to be independent that day and so independence has always been inwardly suspected and cursed. To this day you associate real independence of thought and action with pain, anxiety, and trauma. Like toddlers of 2 or 3 years old you are aware of, and afraid of, your own fragility physically and mentally. And so you over-estimate the power and strength (another talismanic word) of the FATHER figure. He possesses the strength that you in your infantilism and impotency do not possess. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Moreover, it is this infantile fragility and lack of inner strength that prevents you from seeing the other sanely and aright. The other is an enemy not a friend. He is not a human to be respected or regarded as a separate independent being with just as many rights as you. No, to you he is a threat and your heroism depends on his annihilation. This will show Big Daddy how good and obedient you are. The world’s power structures have always ‘divided to conquer’ and have always ‘kept divided to keep conquered.’ As a consequence the power structure has so divided humanity - not only into special function categories but into religious and language and color categories - that individual humans are now helplessly inarticulate in the face of the present crisis. They consider their political representation to be completely corrupted, therefore, they feel almost utterly helpless - R. Buckminster Fuller ( Critical Path ) ...once people are taught to despise the modes of thinking, customs and prejudices of their ancestors, and consider as barbarism and vulgarity all that in their childhood they were accustomed to regard is excellent and elegant - the whole Web of thought and feeling is unraveled, and cannot be readily or easily made up in a new form - Anne Grant ( Essays on the Superstitions of the Highlanders of Scotland, 1811) Yes, the psychologists have already told you what's up. As they have said, a child is born a blank slate, innocent and pure, simple and direct, looking for wholeness and meaning. But instead he gets blasted with a vast chaotic mess of things to identify with and absorb. From the instant he is born in today's hyper manic world he is massively over-exposed to the perverse and meaningless phenomena of societies lacking cohesion or virtue in which nothing is sacred. He meets no wise grandparents or guides. His parents are rarely seen. He becomes as lost and vacuous as the sick narcissistic world to which he has been exposed. He is overwhelmed with all the \"diversity\" (yet another talismanic word you love) and his ego cannot integrate correctly. He is fractured just as his society is fractured. Having nothing upstairs he operates on and from the lowest narcissistic, sensational, level, and will murder to maintain his empty mediocre lifestyle. By design, there is constant invasion of foreign elements. This is due to the connivance of your government and media that has steadily peddled the false merits of over-diversification and globalization for decades. In the end there are so many sub-cultures, cliques, and groovy splinter sects, that one has a devil of a time developing a true and integrated character. Identification with sane things can not occur. Therefore, the all too fragile personality of the child is weak and shallow. Is this not exactly the kind of meekness that the sorcerers so ardently desire? Try going into a confectionary shop to eat every kind of sweet there. You'll be sick as hell in minutes. But this is the way that you have force-fed our ego since the beginning. You are mentally obese. And still you want more! What a great advantage for leaders that the people do not think - Adolf Hitler The most powerful tool in the hand of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed - Stephen Biko (murdered South African activist) The elementary principle of all deception is to attract the enemy’s attention to what you wish him to see & to distract his attention from what you so not wish him to see - General Sir Archibald Wavel "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Your puppet-masters at the Vatican, at the Tavistock Institute, and at Georgetown University, don't want you going around free, integrated and sane. Then you are a danger to them. So, they perpetually over-infuse alien cultures and mores into you overcrowded life-space and, as a result, all peoples and all traditions are compromised. Mention race, tribe, ethnicity, or national sovereignty, and you are looked upon as a dinosaur, an anachronism, something to be incarcerated or liquidated. Your masters, those expert commanders in the war of attrition, have been preparing their twenty-first century \"Bastille\" to keep you and your descendants in order. They are slowly introducing their nightmarish global village in which men will live not as free human beings but as compliant numbered sheep. Privacy will be a thing of the past and you will be valued in relation to the collective, or herd. Step out of line and your ass will be cooked. The death of democracy is not likely to be an assassination from ambush. It will be a slow extinction from apathy, indifference, and undernourishment - Robert Maynard Hutchins The \"house of world order\" will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down. It will look like a great booming, buzzing confusion, but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish more than the old-fashioned frontal assault - Richard Gardner (Quoted from the CFR journal, Foreign Affairs, An American Quarterly Review , April 1974 Edition) But before we play the blame game, let's first realize that it's you who inwardly craves this externally imposed order. It's you who bring this kind of tyranny about. Or did you not know that? The people never give up their liberties, but under some delusion - Edmund Burke (Irish Statesman and Philosopher) L ike an acid the media viruses have corroded your consciousness and made you unsane. A pornographic media has fragmented your children psychically so they don't know if they are coming or going. They are emotionally mutilated shards. They try this and that until jaded and sullied they find out that its all a sick joke. They seek crude power and dominance and finally crave extinction from their own inner angst and fragmentation. Their case is critical but you cannot fix them. You too are broken and lost. So, after the perfidious media is done, the medics move in with their panaceas. You have become uncomfortably numb. You may even crave pain to feel alive. You ride the roller-coaster in your relationships and use conflict to prick yourself awake. You join the club, the herd, and think and act as they do. You have no true sense of self but you can cluster with other toxic non-selves and thereby find a paltry sense of identity and purpose. If Bill O'Reilly and Oprah say it's good, you squeal - its goooood! One girl, hospitalized in a state mental hospital, had slashed her wrists and explained her act by saying that she wanted to see if she had any blood...One of the boys in the training school, for instance, threw rocks up on top of his garage and let them roll down, and would try to catch each rock with his head. His explanation was that this was the only way in which he could feel something...He reported that feeling the pain made him feel at least something - Erich Fromm ( Anatomy of Human Destructiveness ) Each year in the UK more than 24,000 teenagers are admitted to hospital after deliberately harming themselves. But only a small proportion – around 13% – of self-harm episodes are thought to result in a hospital visit. Previous, smaller-scale research found that people who self-harm were more anxious, depressed and had lower self-esteem than those who don’t - (McDougal) As a nation we spend an astonishing $650 million per year on sleeping pills alone. Four million Americans abuse prescription drugs, and are addicted to tranquilizers, stimulants or painkillers - Gregg D. Jacobs ( The Ancestral Mind ) "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"You exist in a state of zombification. And this is not a joke. You are the \"Manchurian Candidate.\" You have been drugged and slowly poisoned by unseen voodoo priests who control your very thoughts. By way of their arsenal of weapons (schools, media, medics, etc), they have gradually but successfully narrowed and limited the parameters of your consciousness. Their real mastery lies in their ability to convince you, their mannequin, that you are in control of your own mental and somatic functions, your own thoughts and beliefs. In this way they are superior to the normal bug-eyed witch-doctor. And may we ask, what is the nature of the hypnotized person? His sensitivity is drastically reduced. His thinking is done for him by someone else. If he is told he is Superman or Sir Lancelot he will believe it. His perception is altered. He will believe anything he is told. He will lose his inhibitions and act out his repressed instincts. Logic and reason go out the window. Meaning has the same value as madness. Salt can taste like sugar. He will commit criminal acts he would normally avoid when in a fully conscious state. He will feel no guilt for any destructive actions. He will walk off the edge of a cliff if told to do so. Truth could be hollered into his ears ad infinitum, and yet he will remain vacant and indifferent. Get the picture? The man who does not know what it means to be under psychic hypnosis, is already under it - Vernon Howard Humankind cannot bear very much reality - T. S. Eliot Nothing lasts forever. And this world of moral delinquents has little time. The Maya saw four creations come and go so there’s nothing new there. This age has gone from beginning to end without the intermediate stage of civilization. Some doing. There is no anti-depressant that will cure a depression that's spiritually based, for the malaise doesn't originate from brain dysfunction, but from an accurate response to the desecration of life - David R. Hawkins ( Power Vs. Force ) If the development of civilization has such a far-reaching similarity to the development of the individual and if it employs the same methods, may we not be justified in reaching the diagnosis that, under the influence of the cultural urges, some civilizations, or some epochs of civilization- possibly the whole of mankind - have become “neurotic?” - Sigmund Freud ( Civilization and its Discontents, 1930) Goethe had a premonition of this decline of the West: even in October 1801 he remarked in conversation...that spiritual emptiness and lack of character were spreading - as if he had foreseen what today characterizes the most celebrated literature of the Free West. It may be that Goethe had even foreseen, in the distant future, the coming of an age in which writers would make great profits by the portrayal of sex and crime for the masses. As Goethe said to Eckermann, on 14th March 1830, “the representation of noble bearing and action is beginning to be regarded as boring, and efforts are being made to portray all kinds of infamies” Previously in a letter to Schiller of 9th August 1797, he had pointed out at least one of the causes of the decline: in the larger cities men lived in a constant frenzy of acquisition and consumption and had therefore become incapable of the very mood from which spiritual life arises - Hans F. K. Günther ( The Religious Attitudes of the Indo-Europeans, on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the 18th century thinker and writer)"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Now can you see why demagogues rise so easily? When mummy and daddy left you could not stand the pain of aloneness and independence. It was too painful to endure and it left many psychic scars. So now you make the world pay for your inability to face this pain that comes with natural organic maturation. That is alright. It is no problem. Those guys are your enemy. They are merely the not-you, so their suffering does not count or matter. Dead bugs on the windscreen. As long as Big Daddy pats you on the head you drool and grin. What they espouse becomes the consensus. Country is important. Government and Homeland Security are important. Patriotism is important. Being the hero, yes, that too is important. The strong hero replaces the weak child. Yep, all of that is important but not the lives of murdered men, women, and children whom you have never met. Daddy's logic is so sweet and simple; when they, the threats, are all gone, all gone away, all dead, then you will have no more fear and no more enemy. Then heaven will descend to earth and peace will reign in the hearts of all god's good obedient children. Then you will finally be a \"strong\" nation. Then you will feel so strong - like \"Thulsa Dooms\" enjoying the aroma atop your mountain of corpses and bones. What of your inner republic? In that narrow, sterile, super lit asylum your dark guardians come and go bringing reports that tell of terrible inner ruin and what needs to be done to restore peace and sanity.

Its not toward your soul you turn but to Prozac and other filthy products of the Beast. You don't face the problem you numb yourself against it. You turn yourself off and thank your psychotropic engendered high for helping you to face the world with that big bright white, white smile. Your being is fractured and your emotional body dismembered and terribly wounded. But even when you know better you continue to pathologically censor yourself and, thereby, you bringing further catastrophe both to your inner republic and to the world. You are like a squatter hiding in a nook beneath the staircase of a wondrous mansion that you forgot belongs to you and that you now fear to explore. Is it not time to open up some doors and step out onto the high balcony again to hear the great bells of creation ringing?

Professor Tolkien has told you now, and \"V\" had something to say on the subject. Were you listening?

Are you not so tired of lying to yourself and accepting the lies of arch-deceivers implying that love can be found where truth is not? Well, dear friends, to find love there must first be truth in your world and heart. And it must be unadulterated and strong. Don't expect to find love without its companion and protector.

A society of sheep must in time beget a government of wolves - Henry de Jouvenal It's a good question, but is there an answer? Yes, there is! It has to do with historical amnesia and with man forgetting about his origins and the legacy of his ancestors. History repeats because man does not learn from the lessons of the past. The maggots and roaches he eradicates from his mansion one day, he invites back in the next.

And all this occurs in an immense country that came out of World War II richer than it went in. And what do we now find? The East is prospering and rising economically at a phenomenal rate. The Third World is fast becoming the First World and the First World is nose- diving into ruin. This was the plan from the start. They sat quiet behind their \"democracy\" until now. But its loud and clear now alright, the truth is out at last - The Aristocrats of foreign allegiance reign. Alright, I have a question. What the hell was the point of having all the world's immigrants come and swamp the US, which has barely the time to begin its life? What was the point of it, we must ask, if the power-brokers knew (as they did) that the east (specifically India and China) was to rise? The US economy is shattered and has been undermined by the Fed for decades. Jobs are outsourced and we are told it is for the good of all, as if we have not heard that one before. Clinton, Kerry, Obama, and even Carter, side with Georgie Boy, and ratify the Patriot Act, and other draconian measures. If you cannot NOW see that this is a ONE PARTY SYSTEM, then you never will. I am not against prosperity coming to poor countries, except that I know why they became poor in the first place. I know why the Communist \"Eastern Bloc\" was also kept behind an \"Iron Curtain\" and kept in a deprived state, until was useful for Big Brother to open those doors.

I am not against people having more, and I believe that help can be sent to them in their own lands. Experts, finances, and other resources can certainly be supplied to mend the wrongs. But immigration of such massive proportions solves nothing. In the end all is ruined. And that's the plan; you can bet on it. Since 1969 specifically the US and Britain have been consciously swamped with immigrant peoples who, for the most part, could not give a damn about their hosts, and who have plied crime, drugs, death and filth since they arrived. We are now seeing the final consequences of this artificially created breach of sovereignty, designed by the British Fabians to wreck America, via its lieutenants like Nixon, Johnson, Reagan, Carter, Clinton and the Georgie Boys and via the Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission.
