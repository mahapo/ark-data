[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" IRELAND Temple Without Walls What were the people by whom it (Egyptian Civilization) was developed, the country whence they came, the Race to which they belonged, is today unknown - Sir G. Maspero ( Dawn of Civilization ) It has not gone unnoticed that the history of the Celtic Races is replete with motifs of magic and mysticism. But those who are conversant with the various myths have been significantly more hesitant to accept that there are, behind the façade of faerie folklore, evidences of super-technologies which would, if existent, have rivaled and even surpassed anything manufactured in our own Silicon Age. There is still incredulity when scholars such as myself assert that the legends of the Celts speak of electronics, cryogenics, robotics, cybernetics, crystallography and even genetics, even though their architectural abilities responsible for temple complexes such as Newgrange and Stonehenge leave us perplexed and humbled. So prevalent and conspicuous are the technological anecdotes that historians have relegated six periods of Ireland’s ancient history to what they term the “Mythologies” in order to occlude serious interest in references of primeval science. Each of the six prehistoric cycles are distinguished by the arrival to the Emerald Isle of a different tribe or race. One of the first recorded arrivals, conservatively estimated as being over 5,000 years BC (but known to be considerably earlier), was of a tribe called Partholon, after its chief. This race engaged in a death struggle with an evil pre-diluvian hybrid race known as the Fomorians. The nemesis of all later invaders, the Fomorians lived under the ocean. They patrolled the coasts and kept watch over the entire land of Ireland by means of a strange seeing crystal housed in a tower of glass on Tory island in County Donegal. Partholon’s people were stricken by a severe plague and none survived. Their communal grave is outside of the modern Dublin. They were followed by the Children of Nemed who also encountered and fought with the Formorians. Nemed and his people were likewise stricken by a plague that utterly decimated their numbers. The third race to arrive are known as the Iberians, the most powerful tribe of which was the Fir Bolg (which translates as “men of wisdom\"). The Iberians are thought to have given Ireland its name Hibernia. Due to their skill and numbers the Iberians were able to keep the Fomorians at bay and successfully conquered the land. They established their headquarters at the hill of Tara or Drumcain (\"Hill of the Serpent\") in the province of Meath (meaning middle). They were the architects"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"responsible for many of the most impressive stone megaliths which cover the land and which are perfectly aligned to various constellations. The Iberians were of the Stellar and Lunar Cults and were matriarchal. Powerful priestesses were among their ruling class. They were the longest reigning prehistoric inhabitants of Ireland. Around 3,000 BC there came to Ireland a people known racially as the Gaels and specifically as the Tuatha de Danaan (the tribe of the goddess Danu). The word Gael connotes “the pure ones.” They were reputed to be a tribe of powerful Druid-kings, possessed of giant stature, great physical strength and weapons and instruments of “magical” power. They declared that they had come from four islands (Falias, Murias, Finias, and Gorias) in the Atlantic that had been destroyed in a deluge caused by the misuse of “magic.” The High King of the Gaels was, suggestively, called Nuada (pronounced Nuah, like Noah). Upon their arrival they made for the west country and after meeting with the ambassadors of the indigenous Iberians, they made war. The de Danaan were victorious but during the conflict Nuada’s arm was cut off. As a result he had to abdicate from the throne, for it was said that none that were “blemished” in any way could rule over the Gaels (an edict which has interesting connotations concerning genetic purity). Later the de Danaan physician fashioned and knit to his king’s body what is rather abstrusely described as a “silver arm.” A few suspect that what lies behind this tale is cybernetics technology for it is speculated that the de Danaan came from Atlantis. The kings and their consorts ruled from Derry in the north where the burial cairn of Nuada still stands. Derry comes from a word meaning Druids. Of the many strange treasures in their possession the de Danaans had four of especial importance. These are a sword, a lance, a chalice or cauldron, and a stone, called the Lia Fail (Stone of Destiny) which could speak. It is thought that these are the prototypes for the suits of the Tarot and of regular gaming cards. It was recorded of this Lance of Lugh that it shook so violently and radiated such heat that those who went anywhere near it would have their hair and fingernails drop off and themselves finally reduced to a heap of ash. He also had a magic spear, which...he had no need to wield himself, for it was alive and thirsted for blood...When battle was near it was drawn out; then it roared and struggled against its thongs; fire flashed from it...it tore through and through the ranks of the enemy, never tired of slaying - Charles Squire ( Celtic Myth and Legend ) After the legendary de Danaans came the Milesians headed by king Mil. His consort was Scota, daughter of an Pharaoh Akhenaton. Her name is commemorated in Scotland . The connection between Ireland and Egypt has been consciously avoided by most modern historians. Ireland was, in fact, the destination of first of Pharaoh of the first dynasty, King Menes, whose grave was found, strangely enough, in Derry. The gravesite of Gaelic queen Macha was mentioned in Egyptian manuscripts, while mummified barbary apes were found in County Armagh passage graves. Upon their arrival Amergin, the magician poet of the Milesians, promised to name Ireland after the three great queens of the de Danaan - Banbha, Fodhla and Eriu (Erin). These have indeed been names of Ireland. Even in the later ages the heroes who were descendants from these tribes were possessed of great \"sidhes\" (Hindu \"powers\"). One of these heroes was Cuchulainn who could make the sea-water boil just by entering into it. This is reminiscent of the somatic powers possessed"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"today by certain Tibetan monks. Many of the symbols that are connected with Ireland are replicated elsewhere. The famous harp motif is reminiscent of the Israelite King David’s harp. The so-called Irish shamrock was actually adopted to commemorate the three circles, or triskellion seen on the robes of visiting Coptic (Egyptian) priests during the early Christian era. Even the \"Stone of Fal\" is said to have been identical with the stone of Bethel that Jacob rested his head upon before having his famous vision. The Celtic alphabet, called Ogham , is common with the Hebrew and Greek as scholars like Robert Graves have proven. The Celts recognized a zodiac of 36 Houses as did the ancient Egyptians. Ireland is networked with megaliths and lay-lines which, prior to the advent of Christianity, formed a giant matrix akin to a modern electrical “mother-board” and many towns and government buildings are still precisely geomantically aligned with these enigmatic sites. But as fascinating as the anecdotes of technical prowess certainly are, even more entrancing, in my own opinion, are the stunning clairvoyant and prophetic powers that my ancient ancestors possessed. Those who are presently desecrating my land, a temple without walls, would do well to read the following prophecy which, coming down from before the time of the Pyramids, seems to clearly implicate them and all of their persuasion. Then she (Badb, Priestess of the Tuatha de Danaan) added a prophecy in which she foretold the approaching end of the Divine Age and the beginning of a new one, in which the summers would be flowerless, the cows milk less and women shameless and men strengthless, in which there will be trees without fruit and seas without fish, when old men would give false judgments and legislators make unjust laws, when warriors would betray one another and men would be thieves and there would be no more virtue in the world. It was said, in days of old, that if one was to shake a tree in Ireland a poet would fall out. Perhaps when those drunk with vengeance and crime have consumed themselves, this could indeed be the case. Here - The Irish Origins of Civilization Close Page to Exit Close Page to Exit"}]
