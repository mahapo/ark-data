As part of this discovery, we have to address the ove r whelmingly important question of how the phenomena of evil came into the world and into the consciousness of Earth‘s human inhabitants. This is a question that should be on the mind of every living man and woman. It has been with us for millennia and it will be with the children of the future if we do not come upon the answer now. We have left the question of evil in the hands of theologians and scientists for too long. This was surely a mistake for , as the casualty statistics clearly testify, the institutions of religion and science have been the worst purveyors of evil that this planet has ever had to e n dure. After centuries of prevarication and criminality, we can no longer afford to look to these edifices to answer the all - important conundrum of evil - Michael Tsarion ( Atlantis, Alien Visitation and Genetic Manipulation ) The object of my book Atlantis, Alien Visitation and Genetic Manipulation , was to offer forth a theory concerning the origins of evil. I had long desired to di s cover how humankind‘s penchant for sadism, cruelty, and injustice came about. The book tells the story of the intervention of alien beings from distant galaxies who, upon their arrival to our planet, engaged in several gene tic hybridization experiments. As a result of these transgenic experiments, ―homo sapiens‖ inherited a divided biology and psyche. This transgression of biological sov e reignty by the alien visitors caused man to be perpetually at war with himself. Man‘s sc hizophrenic nature has given rise to schizogenic societies infested with injustice, crime, delinquency, and perversity. This is psychology ―101‖ and it remains a self - evident fact regardless of whether the deep symbiotic conne c tions between mind and world are acknowledged and accepted or whether they are not. Sadly, it may take another age before people of today‘s spiritually impov e rished world understand the subtle rapport between microcosm and macr o cosm. Nevertheless, let it be understood clearly and dist inctly that freedom and truth will not visit the world while the hearts and minds of men remain to x ic, immoral, and enslaved. As I assert in my other works, there can be no hope of positive change in our world until the true origins of evil are reappraised and understood, and until men take responsibility for their mutilated psychic cond i tion. The problems that beset us today, both existentially and socially, have a date of birth. As I show in my work on Atlantis, we were not always beset by such chronic p sychic and social problems. Historically speaking they are recent phenomena. They date to about 13,000 years ago and they do not have to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"persist. In fact, it is my belief that we are now in the final phase of the old p a radigm. The time is coming when both the protagonists and the antagonists in the human drama will be compelled to face the legacy of the past and also the forces that enter their lives to restore balance. Although I covered some of the key events pertaining to the alien visitation, and subseq uent infection of our perfumed planet by their presence, and a l though I did bring things up to the present ―Silicon Age,‖ I stressed that it was not possible to cover the various exploits and machinations of the visitors throughout history. Space did not p ermit me to delineate the fascinating story of how the surviving Atlanteans and Lemurians (both descendants of the so - called ―Fallen Angels‖) toiled to establish new civilizations after incomprehen s ibly horrific cataclysms decimated their habitats. It is t ime now to address the new world that arose in the aftermath of the ―Age of Catastrophe.‖ ◊◊◊ In the present volume, several novel ideas that the reader should be aware of are presented. The first and most important argument concerns the West to East mig ration of the elements of civilization. This theory rests upon the u n derstanding that there were, in prehistoric times, highly developed civilizations situated in the W estern hemisphere. These civilizations were brought to an abrupt end approximately 13,00 0 years BC, by terrestrial upheavals of an u n imaginable scale. The gnosis that had been accumulated by the advanced i n habitants of these hoary civilizations originated on the landmasses known t o day as Ireland, England, Scotland, and W ales. These countries were once part of Atlantis or, more specifically, of the great continent of Appalachia. From these locations the gnosis was eventually carried Eastward across lost land bridges into Europe and Asia. Secondly, we contend that the term Aryan has been most eg regiously m i sused. W e believe it referred not to race but caste. It was a term that simply distinguished spiritual and moral status. In our work, therefore, we use the term to refer to men from any racial stock who had perfected themselves in schools of in itiation and who were adepts of high order. W e use the term to identify the Irish Druids and their Mesolithic ancestors, the European Sami, the Phoenician and Median Magi, the Egyptian Disciples of Horus, the Mer, the Ibaru, and any other group of bards, p oets, seers, prophets, hierophants, ar c himandrites, and architects of distinction. The term Aryan was erroneously a c cepted as a racial distinction after its discovery by the eighteenth century scholar and Chief Justice Sir W illiam Jones of Calcutta. Jones discovered that the Hindus referred to their ancestors who appeared in Northern India and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"P a kistan during the seventh century BC, as the ―Arya.‖ He did not realize that the term signified spiritual qualities rather than racial, ethnic, or linguistic ones. As linguists adopt the term to signify a class of languages, so we adopt it in a purest context to represent those Elders of any racial background possessed of exalted minds and hearts. W e are convinced that our rendition and interpr e tation will serve to c larify many historical anomalies and mysteries. When speaking of the racial origins or nature of the Mesolithic and Megalithic Irish, we prefer to use the more descriptive and accurate terms ―Nordic,‖ ―Gothic,‖ ―Caucasian,‖ and ―Indo - European.‖ Thirdly, w e reject the term ―Celtic,‖ and refuse to use it when describing the ancient inhabitants existing in Ireland before 600 BC. W e tentatively accept that Britain was finally reached by people who have been called ―Goidelic‖ and ―Brythonic‖ Celts after 600 BC; groups that anthropologists and historians f i nally had to admit were merely fragments of the larger Indo - European race. Of these invasions have Tacitus, Caesar, and Pythias the Greek, written. Neve r theless, we prefer to deal with the pre - Celtic inhabitant s and their antique civ i lization that had, in remote ages, spread Eastward into Europe and Asia. We leave the word ―Celtic‖ intact when quoting, confident that the reader will u n derstand that it is a blanket term often used indiscriminately by authors refe r ring to Ireland‘s exceptionally gifted inhabitants who are, more correctly, the ―Mesolithic‖ or even ―Megalithic‖ people; builders of the cyclopean temples of Ireland and the world that still stand as silent testaments to their august pre s ence. The Celtic tribes of the Iron Age, believed to have entered Ireland after 600 BC, built their own civilizations upon the foundations of earlier ones they found there, which they reckoned had been erected by the ―gods.‖ The Tuatha, G. W. Atkinson supposes, must be th e highly intellectual race that i m ported into Ireland our Oghams, round towers, architecture, metal work, and, above all, the exquisite art which has come down to us in our wonderful illuminated Irish man u scripts. The polished Tuatha were certainly contra sted with the rude Celts. Arthur Clive declares that civilization came in with an earlier race than the Celts, and retired with their conquest by the latter - James Bonwick ( Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions ) The Tuatha de Danann were the ancient inhabi tants of Ireland who were forced to give way to the Gaels and to become the gods of Celtic imagination, the lords of the subte r ranean world. There is no doubt that the name Tuatha de Danann was given to the pre - Celtic inhabitants of Ireland and that it mus t have been they who built the megaliths. Their uncertain origins combined with their curious stone constructions give them a cloak of mystery...If the Celts drove out the megalithic peoples of Ireland, there is no reason why the same thing should not have happened on the continent, where much of the region occupied by the Celts still bears traces of megalithic monuments - Jean Ma r kale ( The Celts ) The first authority to dispense with the term ―Celtic,‖ and to point out its sp u riousness, was the great altern ative historian and linguist Professor Laurence Austine W addell. Strangely, although they probably were, and are,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"familiar with Professor Waddell‘s writings and theories, most historians (alternative and orthodox) have continued to employ the term ―Celtic‖ even when it is liable to engender and perpetuate misunderstandings. In our work we adhere to Pr o fessor Waddell‘s sound counsel regarding this unfortunate but widely used term. ...there is no evidence in the British Isles to suggest that a population grou p of any size migrated from the continent in the first millennium BC - Sir Barrington Windsor Cunliffe ( Iron Age Britain ) No traditional or historical reference or record whatever exists of the migration of any people called \"Celts\" into Early Britain - P rofessor L. A. Waddell ( Phoenician Origins of the Britons, Scots, and Anglo - Saxons ) ...to speak, as is so commonly done, of \"Celtic ancestry,\" the \"Celtic temperament\" and \"Celtic fire\" amongst any section of the natives of these islands, is, according to a nthropologists, merely imaginary! - ibid The term ―Celt‖ did not exist in the ancient languages of the Irish, Scots, or W elsh. There is only the Pictish Khaltis , most likely signifying invaders from France, Belgium, Germany, Galatia, and the Ukraine. The t erm ―Celt‖ ( Keltoi ) was first employed by the incompetent Greek historian Herodotus to describe W estern Europeans such as the Irish, Scots, and Gauls, etc. After his time other historians, such as Caesar and Strabo, continued to use this vague term to broa dly denote any foreign tribe that Rome considered barbaric and ant a gonistic. Suggestively, however, Caesar, Tacitus, Hecataeus, Strabo, and H e rodatus, never employed the term to describe the people of Britain. And this at least we find accurate. Possibly, they knew that these Celtic groups were, as their languages indicate, merely a branch of the Indo - European race that had inherited their language, customs, traditions, and religion from highly sophist i cated ancestors whom most historians and anthropologist s have been consp i cuously reluctant to name or describe, and whose influence had spread to I n dia, Egypt, China, and the Americas. It is only in relatively recent times that this ambiguous term ―Celtic‖ has been transposed to define the early Irish. By the nineteenth century its usage in this regard was common. Nevertheless, to use the term ―Celtic‖ to signify the racial quality of the ancient Irish is an utterly futile endeavor since the physiology, stature, and pigmentation of these peoples is markedly dis similar from those Pictish, Gaelic, Slavic, Germanic, Alpine, Iberian, Mediterranean, (―Continental‖) Celtic types that, although r e lated to Indo - European races, had probably perpetually crossed - bred with non - Caucasians throughout Europe and Asia. In the composition of Celtic the old Indo - European predominates enormously. This is an established fact of great importance - M. R. Dobie ( The Rise of the Celts )"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"So we see that the ambiguous term ―Celtic‖ was introduced at a late date by Greeks and Romans. Then i n the seventeenth century it was re - introduced by the W elsh antiquarian Edward Lhuyd (1660 - 1709), and by others of his sent i mental disposition. W e would prefer the term be dropped universally when r e ferring to the racial origins of the ancient Britons and Irish. The Irish were not ―Celtic.‖ They were Celticized by invading foreign powers; particularly those from Rome. Did the islanders really call themselves Celts?...It is extremely doubtful whether the inhabitants of Ireland ever gave themselves a name of the kind - M. R. Dobie ( The Rise of the Celts ) However, there is one thing that the Romans, modern archaeologists and the Iron Age islanders themselves would all agree on: they were not Celts. This was an invention of the 18th century; the name was not use d earlier. The idea came from the discovery around 1700 that the non - English island tongues relate to that of the ancient contine n tal Gauls, who really were called Celts. This ancient continental ethnic label was applied to the wider family of languages. B ut 'Celtic' was soon extended to describe insular monuments, art, culture and peoples, ancient and modern: island 'Celtic' identity was born, like Britishness, in the 18th century – Dr. Simon James ( The Peoples of Britain ) After its introduction by Edward Lluyd in 1707, the use of the word \"Celtic\" as an u m brella term for the pre - Roman peoples of Britain gained considerable popularity in the nineteenth century, and remains in common usage. However its historical basis is now seen as dubious by many historia ns and archaeologists, and this usage has been called into question. Simon James, formerly of the British Museum...makes the point that the Romans never used the term \"Celtic‖...in reference to the peoples of Britain and Ireland, and points out that the mode rn term \"Celt\" was coined as a useful umbrella term in the early 18th century to distinguish the non - English inhabitants of the archip e lago when England united with Scotland in 1707 to create the Kingdom of Great Britain and the later union of Great Britai n and Ireland as the United Kingdom in 1800. Nationa l ists in Scotland, Ireland and Wales looked for a way to differentiate themselves from England and assert their right to independence. James then argues that, despite the obvious linguistic connections, a rchaeology does not suggest a united Celtic culture and that the term is misleading, no more (or less) meaningful than \"Western\" - (Wikip e dia Online Encyclopedia) The so - called Celtic Question, than which no greater stumbling block in the way of clear thin king exists...there is practically today a complete unanimity of opinion among physical anthropologists that the term Celt, if used at all, belongs to the brachycephalic (round - headed) darkish population of the Alpine (Swiss) highlands...totally lacking in the British Isles - W. Z. Ripley ( Races of Europe ) \"Celt\" is now a term that skeptics consider so corrupted in the archaeological and popular literature that it is worthless - Stephen Oppenheimer ( The Origins of the British: A G e netic Detective Story ) The ter m ―Gaelic‖ (referring to later Celtic arrivals, the ―Goidels‖) is retained when quoting, and as a traditionally acceptable term for the language spoken"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"in Ireland from a remote period, influenced by later visitors, and radically mo d ified after the coloniza tion of Romans, Anglo - Saxons, and Normans. W e hes i tate to use the term to designate the primordial inhabitants of Ireland. The Gaels, or Goidels, were another branch of the Celtic groups from Europe who allegedly crossed to Ireland around the fourth, fifth , or sixth centuries BC (d e pending on which officially posited theory one believes). These Goidels were known by the Irish mythographers as the ―Milesians‖ or ―Children of Mil.‖ They were descendants of the Scythian ―Celts‖ who had visited Egypt and return ed to their W estern homelands after the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaton. Among their number was Scota, the daughter of the Atonist pharaoh and his consort Nefertiti. ◊◊◊ In his fine book Dawn of Civilization , Egyptologist Sir G. Maspero expressed a great hist orical question that we seek, in our present text, to address and solve. He asked: What were the people by whom it (Egyptian Civilization) was developed, the country whence they came, the Race to which they belonged, is today unknown The solution to this a ge - old problem involves a critical look at the information that has been supplied to us concerning the origin, migration, and dispersion of the elements of civilization. It involves a reappraisal of Post - Diluvian history and of the roles played, not only b y the empires of Asia Minor and Egypt, but also by those of Ireland, Scotland, W ales, and England. This work will show the reader how important the ancient lands, known poetically as Logres and Albion , were to the future of the world. In this text, we will show that the civili z ing role of these lands has been deliberately obscured due to a pernicious age - long campaign of knowledge suppression and mass - murder. The auction of a whole civilization, the finest known, and the extermination of the Druids, are two of many subjects that are brought into the limelight in these volumes. It is for this reason that this author first chose, in his previous book, to deal with Atlantis and Lemuria, since it was from there that the story of the ancestors of the Gaels and Ce lts began. If we are to seek out the origins of the Arthurian legends and of the W elsh, Irish, and Scottish myths, it is to lost A t lantis and Lemuria that we are to look. And if we are to seek out reasons as to why the true story of these places and people s has not hitherto been revealed, we need to begin with the contingents who dominate and rule mankind from behind the obvious thrones of religion and politics. As I revealed in my first book, these ruthless agencies also happen to have their origins in"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"the ancient past. They are either the biological or ideological descendants of the sorcerers of Atlantis. In our text we wish to accomplish three main things. W e wish to explore, as much as may be possible, the evidence for the W est to East migration of the e lements of civilization. However, since it is illogical to suppose that any single volume can hope to furnish complete proof of this thesis, we offer our work as an introductory overview to stimulate interest with the reminder that it is merely a progress report on a great study that needs the proverbial jump - start. This great thesis was first explored at the turn of the last century by Anna W ilkes and Conor Mac Dari and then, later, by the great Comyns Beaumont. Since Beaumont‘s time interest has lapsed an d we know its controversiality to be the reason for this. W e specifically address the Irish origins of civilization and b e gin at least to nullify many of the counter - arguments that deem the elements of civilization to be of Greek, Roman, and Jewish origin. Furthermore, we eagerly examine the ancient roots of modern tyranny. The Irish origins of civilization have been obscured and we find ourselves duly interested in the nature and agenda of the obscurers. Their contentious work had to be for a reason and we suppose they have not confined their work of obscuration to this one area alone. Moreover, as we will show, the millennia - old knowledge possessed and used to good effect by the ancient Druids and their ancestors was appr o priated by those with no legitimat e claim to it. It has been used as a weapon against humanity. The wielders of the weapon of occult knowledge will be r e vealed and their executive branch finally exposed before the world. W e strongly believe and advocate that it is quite impossible for good men to ever triumph over the malign (and originally alien) Establishment that controls humankind without a thorough working knowledge of the way in which it operates to achieve success. If we are to defeat the world‘s merciless and tyra n nical hierarchs we must, like detectives, be thoroughly conversant with their modus operandi and, like hounds on a trail, must be familiar with their scent, so to speak. Our adversary is both a mutilator and a scavenger. It is a virus within the ailing body politic. It is a cunning alien force that has infected h u mankind with its own anti - human nature. It is within us as much as it is out there in our world. W e are either of its kind, and under its power, or we are its sworn opponents. In light of this, my inquiry is not for everyone. It has been composed for the new generation of Opposers , imbued with an ardent and u n vanquishable Spirit of Rebellion . It is a manifesto for those who will in their time witness the demise of evil and the ruin of its agents. It is not for those who cannot comprehend the severity of the infamy in their world or who lack the Spirit of Contradiction .

Like Edgar Allen Poe‘s nightmarish pendulum, the blades of the tyrannical ritual - murderers are now as I write descending toward the neck of humanity for the last tim e.

Man's Irrefutable Errors The Irish are one of the most ancient nations that I know of at this end of the world, and are from as mighty a race as the world ever brought forth - Edward Spense r (writer, and British Government official in Ireland, AD 1596) In this volume we seek to present, in as erudite a manner as possible, the case for the Irish origins of civilization . W e have been driven to publicly present the fruits of our lifelong inquir y into this subject partly because we wish to correctly frame our efforts at historical revisionism. Our revisionism exists so that men might discover what has been hidden from them regarding history and religion. Only with correct knowledge of the past ca n men build a sane world fit to live in. The man living his life in confusion, impotency, and fear, is the man expertly trained to forget where he has come from. From his prec a rious pedestal his vision of the world is skewed and limited and his fall into t he void prevented only by externally provided stabilizers. Such a man remains existentially weak, like a fragile sapling in danger of breaking in a light breeze let alone in a mighty storm. Alternatively, the strong man has a sense of where he has come fro m. He stands upon his own feet and from a stable pedestal views both past and future with clear fearless eyes. He does not prevaricate when it comes to questions of justice. He hastens to challenge those who would strangle him in webs of ignorance and work s relentlessly to expose the criminality of those who have in ages past massacred his ancestors, and pr e sently threaten his hard won physical and mental freedom. The strong man knows his job is to build well upon the solid foundations laid by his ancestors . He wages perpetual war against those who attempt to burn down those fou n dations. Serving the will of his ancestors is the strong man's passion. The weak man, on the other hand, meekly heeds the commands of deceivers bent upon using ancient occult knowled ge to physically and spiritually undermine his brothers and sisters in the world. The strong undefeatable man knows his enemies and how to correctly deal with them. He has studied their nature and the knowledge they perversely use as a weapon against him a nd all humanity.

W e are not motivated by the lure of awards, flowers, and speeches. W e are in dread earnest in our opposition to despots who, on a daily basis, clearly demonstrate their co n te mpt for truth, freedom, and justice. W e stand against the tyrannous arch i tects of the ―New World Order‖ rising from the ashes of an old order humanity is not meant to know existed. W e oppose this new inhuman Atonist order without fear or fright, and pity i ts makers for their psychosis and spiritual vacuity. Their days of infamy and oppression are coming to an end and it only r e mains for us to dig deep the graves into which they will inevitably crash, along with their treachery and megalomania. To such work we are temperamentally well suited. Certainly, we are not in opposition to religion as it is practiced by the sincere independent devotee. W e do not seek to intrude into that space reserved for private worship. But we do stand opposed to the institutions t hat have inserted themselves and their mythology between the individual and his creator. W e do not intend to offer any disclaimer and dedicate ourselves pa s sionately to our free thought and analysis of the phantasmagorias placed b e fore us by the institutio ns of the world. Our attitude is best expressed by the German historian Max Muller who, in 1878, wrote: A comparison of all the religions of the world, in which none can claim a privileged p o sition, will no doubt seem to many dangerous and reprehensible... But this I will say, that, as far as my humble judgment goes, it does not entail the loss of anything that is essential to true religion, and that, if we strike the balance honestly, the gain is imme a surably greater than the loss...All truth is safe, and n othing else is safe; and he who keeps back the truth, or withholds it from men...is either a coward or a criminal, or both - ( The Science of Religion ) What are civilizations made of? How do they come about? Are the foundations of our civilization strong or weak? Are these questions meaningful to modern men and women? Perhaps they are, and perhaps not. In any case, when we examine the deep foundations of civilization, we discover something fascinating. W e discover that our ancestors had based their live s upon instruction taken from the heavens above their heads. The night sky was the veritable altar of ancestral man. All that occurred in it was reverently observed, recorded, and contemplated. W as this superstition or something else? And what could have p rompted such devotion? W ho first developed the idea to look up to the starry sky for instru c tion? W ho first decided to map the rotating paths of the sun and moon and to demarcate the zodiac's twelve signs? And was this exercise a misguided waste of time an d energy, or did it matter? Have human civilizations been founded and guided aright by those whose heads"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"were well and truly \"in the clouds?\" Research into these questions and into \"heavenly\" matters reveals the zodiac to be a very mysterious and important phenomenon. It was referred to as the celestial mystery school for good reason since, strange as it may seem at first, the zodiac mirrors consciousness. The men who looked up into the night sky were really looking into themselves. The gnosis of the heav ens is the gnosis of the soul. Civilizations erected upon zodiacal principles are erected upon the infinite ancestral reservoir of kno w ledge within man's own being. There are no stronger foundations. As the He r metic motto states: As Above, So Below . Our p resent understanding of the zodiac is far from that of the ancient magi. The keepers of the mysteries of the heavens knew the zodiac to be a projection of the human unconscious and not merely an external phenomenon. There was nothing contained in the heave ns and zodiac that did not dwell within the mind of man. There was nothing in nature that was not part of man. Nature was not seen as a having a separate or distinct life. Its life was man's life. Man's life was nature's life. Man and nature are one, and t here is no separating the two. This is the sum of the lost knowledge of the ancients. The first people in recorded history to study the operations of the heavens and zodiac, and to understand the strange but intimate connections between physical and psychi c energy, were the Druids from the \"Fortunate\" or \"Blessed Isles.\" From these Elders the arcane archive of knowledge was surreptitiously appropriated by their enemies, the servants of darkness, whose biological and ideological descendants now rule the worl d. Despite coming under their vile blood - soaked hands it has not perished. It took birth in an age before our own in pla c es lost to history and time, but not to memory .

Such is the law of life. Man can learn this law, and adapt to it, or he can ignore it. His choice determines his future. As the American philosopher Ayn Rand said: ―Man is free to choose not to be conscious, but not free to escape the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction.‖ Most historians accept that Egypt was a c radle of civilization, and that many cultural idioms and traditions come from there. W hat has yet to be understood, however, is the manner in which Egypt inherited its cultural elements from the lands of the North - W est. This fact is not known today because of the threat it poses to Rome and London, the Vatican and Crown, and to all those who have profited from the suppression of knowledge. After all, what is the subject of history? It is the study of the past, certainly. But it is also the study of man. It is the attempt by men to find out who they are by analyzing and reviewing what they have been. Even though scientific methodologies have a role within the subject of history, history is not science. Most importantly, students of hi s tory can easily be misle d. A lot of problems and errors can come about when men attempt to study men. Moreover, the subject itself may be deliberately manipulated and skewed so that little is truly known. Paradoxically, it takes time to erase the fallacies that men entertain abou t the past. The proof for what we say is evident to those who have taken the time to think about history and what has been taught to them about the world of the ancestors. The su b ject of history is less than 200 years old. In that time men have convinced t hemselves of the following suppositions, some of which have been regarded as irrefutable truths. There were no advanced pre - diluvian civilizations Early man was primitive, rude, and malevolent The Mesolithic and Megalithic sites throughout the world were constructed by unrelated races The ambassadors of civilization were Greeks, Romans, and Jews The various elements of civilization were brought by the \"Chosen People\" from East to W est The Jews were uniquely distinguished. They possessed a naturally religious and moral disposition and were truly a god - inspired ―chosen people‖ The Jews were slaves in Egypt and hard - pressed to preserve their unique identity and beliefs"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Egyptian religion and culture had no effect on Jewish beliefs and lifestyle The Hebrew language has no connection to the Egyptian Monotheism was essent ially a Jewish phenomenon The Israelites were not given to idolatry The bible provides accurate accounts of historical occurrences The Jews were Semites Christianity is of Roman invention Race mattered to the ancients The word Aryan denoted race Happily, these preposterous fallacies are finally being revised. Constantine the Great (who was proclaimed emperor in Britain, in the year 306 AD)and his bishops would have been very aware of the pagan myths and legends of the British Isles. Since the city of Rome is perfectly geomantically aligned with the sun - door of Newgrange tumulus in Ireland, we can confidently conclude that they would have known about the antiquity of Ireland and about Druidic traditions and teachings. Therefore, we mus t begin to realize just how supremely important it was for those Atonist sorcerers from Alexandria, Constantinople, Rome, Burgu n dy, and The Stone of Bethel - the famous stone mentioned in the Old Testament actually sits in front of the doorway of Newgrange tumulus in County Meath Ireland. The three spirals upon it (and also inside the cairn) are unique.

Most of them were hopelessly incompetent a t the job and so their final compilation, the bibelot considered so sa c red, reads as it does today. The later efforts at editing and revising undertaken by Francis Bacon and his team did little to improve the travesty. Most of the hired scribes and editors knew precious little about the world beyond their scriptoriums.

Some wonderfully clever writers have been led astray by these deceptions of \"history\" - Conor MacDari The official consensus is that approximately 7,000 years ago the ancestors of Irish \"Celts\" broke off from dispersing and migrating Indo - European trib es that originated in the Ukrainian steppes of Russia, and that may have been de s cendants of the Kurgans of that region. Although they were racially kindred with the early Romans, Greeks, and Germans, the various \"Celtic\" groups gr a dually formed their own separate identities and traditions. This theory was apparently strengthened after the discovery of stunningly sophisticated burial sites at Hallstatt in Austria and La Tene in Switzerland, constructed approxim a tely 3,500 years ago. Old as they are, the civ ilizations revealed at Hallstatt and La Tene were related to Brythonic Celtic groups only and not, as was falsely implied, with those that frequented Ireland. Clearly, an earlier and more illus t rious race or tribe was responsible for the prehistoric sites found throughout Ireland. With regard to the La Tène civilization, certain archeologists and historians have made a mistake which must be corrected. The Celts have been the subject of a false arg u ment in archaeology similar to those committed with regard t o them in anthropology. Such indications as we possess have been given a too general significance, and they have been taken to mean that the La Tène civilization and the Celts were one and the same thing. One school has in this way abbreviated the history of the Celts in Ireland in the most misleading way, making it begin with the earliest La Tène objects found in the island. It is necessary here, at the outset, to state...that the civilization of La Tène really corresponds to only one of the groups of the Ce lts, who had split up long before the fifth century before Christ. It is the culture of the Continental Brythons, who afterwards became leaders of the other groups. It is not that of the Goidels of Ireland - M. R. Dobie ( The Rise of the Celts ) ...the Celts enter history from around 600 BC, they are already split into several langu a ge groups, and spread over much of Central Europe, the Iberian peninsula, Ireland and Britain, and studies now suggest that some of the Celtic peoples - including the ance s tors of all the modern Celtic nations - had a largely pre - Celtic genetic ancestry, shared with the Basque people and possibly going back to the Paleolithic - (Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia) The orthodox view of the origins of the Celts turns out to be an archaeol ogical myth left over from the 19th century.

It is also the basis of a strong sense of ethni c identity that millions of members of the so - called Celtic diaspora hold. But there is absolutely no evidence, linguistic, archaeological or genetic, that identifies the Hallstatt or La Tène regions or cu l tures as Celtic homelands. The notion derives from a mistake made by the historian Herodotus 2,500 years ago when, in a passing remark about the \"Keltoi,\" he placed them at the source of the Danube, which he thought was near the Pyrenees. Everything else about his description located the Keltoi in the reg ion of Iberia - Stephen Oppenhe i mer ( The Origins of the British: A Genetic Detective Story ) Despite the consensus of orthodox anthropologists, the fact is that neither the Irish nor their Druidic Elders descended from the Kurgans or early Ukrainian hunter - gatherers. They did not, as most stubborn historians and commentators believe, hail from the Steppes of Russia, Harz Mountains, Balkans, or Danube Valley. Their origins are to be found exactly where their own legends state, in the ancient civilizations tha t existed and thrived before recorded history. The vast majority of intellectuals and academics pay little mind to such times and places and, despite the plethora of archaeological evidence clearly proving the existence of pre - diluvian civilizations, they continue like amnesiacs to seek for answers where they are never to be found. ...it appears that the population of Ireland came from the West, and not from Asia - that it was one of the many waves of population flowing out from the Island of Atlantis - an d herein we find the explanation of that problem which has puzzled the Aryan scholars. As Ireland is farther from the Punjab than Persia, Greece, Rome, or Scandinavia, it would follow that the Celtic wave of migration must have been the earliest sent out f rom the Sanskrit centre; but it is now asserted by Professor Schleicher and others that the Celtic tongue shows that it separated from the Sanskrit original tongue later than the others, and that it is more closely allied to the Latin than any other Aryan tongue. This is entirely inexplicable upon any theory of an Eastern origin of the Indo - European r a ces, but very easily understood if we recognize the Aryan and Celtic migrations as going out about the same time from the Atlantean fountain - head. There are m any points confirmatory of this belief. In the first place, the civilization of the Irish dates back to a vast antiquity - Ignatius Donnelly ( Atlantis: the Antediluvian World , 1882) ...there is no evidence in the British Isles to suggest that a population group of any size migrated from the continent in the first millennium BC - Sir Barrington Windsor Cunliffe ( Iron Age Britain ) The myths and legends of our ancestors were composed by people whose world was anything but stable and unchanging.

The second period ties in with the date Plato ascribed in the Timaeus and Critias to the destruction by earthquakes and flooding of Atlantis, and with the Tamil myth of the submerging of the fabled land of Kumari Kandam. There is also strong evidence that nearly half the total meltwater released at the end of the last Ice Age was concentrated into these three relatively short periods. Such events would have had a momentous impact on the h u man inhabitants at that time, leaving a marked impression on oral tradition, the original transmitter of all ancient myths - Harry Young ( Bridging the Myth and Science of the Flood ) Even though the devastating cataclysms that obliterated the antique civili z a tions left survivors in a desperate physical state, it did not leave them in as primitive a condition as we are compelled to believe from the writings of hist o rians of later ages, erroneously convinced their Neolithic cave - dwellers were the first civiliz ed specimens on Earth. A study of the myriad Mesolithic and Megalithic ruins of Britain and Europe (created as requiems in stone to vani s hed technology of lost ages), of the various cyclopean remains of sunken c i ties and Earth zodiacs, and of the worldwide petroglyphic record, convinces us that the official dates given for human technological development are inacc u rate and unsustainable. In short, there is a big difference between the sorry prehistoric creatures conjured before us by myopic historians and t hose who, having been robbed of their advanced cultural trappings and displaced from ancestral habitats, were subsequently compelled to rebuild empires after the originals had been obliterated by ferocious forces believed to have been unl e ashed by angry an d vengeful gods. The situation is perfectly explained by Comyns Beaumont, one of the very few men to refute the welter of historical fallacies concerning primordial humanity:"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The ancient civilization of the land we call Egypt has been pronounced by archaeo l o gists as flawless of its type from the very first.

If both types were derived from one original source, as generally accepted today, it f ollows that those of the North and West, more primitive constructions than the mastabas...must have preceded them. It would be manifestly absurd to argue that mastabas, perfected as they were, would be taken to the West in a far ruder and more primitive fo rm. Thus the inference must be that the mastabas are a development of the earlier chambered barrows from the West and North - ibid After detailed studies into antiquity Beaumont, like a few other brave alternat i ve historians, was convinced that great civil izations of the past had been ent i rely decimated in some kind of universal upheaval of unimaginable propo r tions. It was, they conjectured, the survivors from a ruined world who transmi t ted the elements of civilization into the new world that arose from the ashes of the old. Since the survivors of the pre - diluvian empires had been displaced to various parts of the globe, we find the strikingly similar cultural elements a p pearing in every hemisphere. Suggestively, in many cases, we also find the earliest elem ents to be more sophisticated than later variants. All we can see with certainty is that the earliest inventions of mankind are the most wonderful that the race has ever made...The first use of fire, and the discovery of the methods by which it can be kind led; the domestication of wild animals; and, above all, the processes by which the various cereals were first developed out of some wild gra s ses - these are all discoveries with which, in ingenuity and in importance, no subsequent discoveries may compare. Th ey are all unknown to history - all lost in the light of an effulgent dawn - Professor Max Muller And as this commerce could not, as we have seen, have been carried on by the R o mans, Greeks, Etruscans, or Phoenicians, because their civilizations flourished during the Iron Age, to which this age of bronze was anterior, where then are we to look for a great maritime and commercial people, who carried vast quantities of copper, tin, and bronze (unalloyed by the lead of the south of Europe) to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, England, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy?

Quandaries concerning the o rigins of the Irish \"Celts\" can be explained when we take heed of what the legends say, the authentic legends that is, rather than those concocted to rei n force the lie of an Eastern origin of the Irish. It is in these legends that speak of a Western origin that we find the truth concerning the ancient history of Ireland and the world. It is from the Irish legends that we find the most intriguing ref e rences to the lost pre - diluvian continent of Atlantis. In 1929, the author Elena Maria W hitshaw, wrote in her book Atlantis in Spain that the Spanish mariners and explorers, particularly during the time of Columbus, frequently visited the shores of Southern Ireland searching for evidence concerning the lost cont i nent they referred to as Antilia. Clearly, the Span ish were in no doubt where to look for knowledge concerning the world that existed before the flood. W hi t shaw wrote: The presence of the Irishman among the Palos sailors was no fortuitous circumstance. Fray Ortega tells us that every year down to 1492 thes e Spanish mariners had sought the Island of Saint Brandon, who as the Book of Lismore tells us...was the founder of the Monastery of Clonfert in the eighth century, and wandered up and down the coast of Kerry \"seeking for traditions of the Western Continen t\" and praying that \"the hidden land\" might be revealed to them W e might also add that, in our opinion, the great Tartessian (\"Atlantean\") ruins, galleries, wells, and forts of Andalucía, that Whitshaw studied for most of her life, and that inspired her bo ok, are of Irish design. These ruins date from over 10,000 years ago and are marvels of Neolithic construction. Although they w e re subsequently built upon by settlers from Eastern lands, they are clearly of W estern origins. Certain researchers and experts on British prehistory have voiced doubts as to whether any so - called \"Celtic\" tribes ever actually invaded Ireland. L. A. Wa d dell and Beaumont found the idea preposterous. And the new science of DNA substantially corroborates their doubts concerning the sp uriousness of \"Celtic\" East to Wes t migration theories. Geneticist and genealogist, Professor Brian Sykes confirms, in his book Saxons, Vikings and Celts: The Genetic Roots of Britain and Ireland, that the Celts did not contribute to the DNA of the origina l inhabitants of Ireland. He shows that migrations from the East had no substa n tial effect on the genetic makeup of the aboriginal Irish. Moreover, he confirms that 9,000 years ago the ancestors of the Irish, W elsh, Scots, and English, crossed land bridges connecting their lands to Europe. Moving Eastwards th e se tribes found Europe to be drastically underpopulated.

And most of us are familiar with the idea that the English are descended from Anglo - Saxons, who invaded eastern England after the Romans left, while most of the people in the rest of the British Isles derive from indigenous Celtic ancestors with a sprinkling of Viking blood around the fringes. Yet there is no agreement among historians or archaeologists on the meaning of the words \"Celtic\" or \"Anglo - Saxon.\" What is more, new evidence from genetic an a lysis (see note below) indicates that the Anglo - Saxons and Celts, to the extent that they can be defined genetically, were both small immigran t minorities.

Recognition of the existence and importance of Atlantis in world affairs is an essential prerequisite to the study of the history of the world, and particularly of the British Isles and Scandinavia. To acknowledge the existence of pre - diluvian empires is to have the clouds of darkness over Ireland's prehistory disperse. The veils and webs of confusion are removed while scintillating beams of light illuminate the mysteries of that great country's ancient past. The history of Ireland is commonly divided into two main cycles - the \"Mythol ogical\" and the \"Historical.\" The former cycle deals with the ages when Ireland was colonized by fantastic races whose skills and sophistication confound modern historians who would rather we believe the accounts to be fanciful and inaccurate. Segmenting I reland's prehistory in this manner was a cunning ruse to make it easier for historians and clerics to dismiss and d e nounce the many spectacular accounts of advanced weaponry and machinery, of advanced technical ability, and of aesthetic and magical prowess , to be found throughout the mythic accounts. Unlike the natives of Britain and Scotland, the Irish in pre - Christian times were not brought into contact with Roman institutions or Roman culture. In consequence they created and developed a civilization of their own that was in some respects without equal. They were far advanced in the knowledge of metal - work and shipbuilding; they engaged in commerce; they loved music and had an acquaintance with letters; and when disputes arose among them, these were settl ed in duly constituted courts of ju s tice, presided over by a trained lawyer, called a brehon, instead of being settled by the stern arbitrament of force.

For let us not doubt that there has been considerable distortion from Christian sources when it c o mes to Ireland's prehistory, particularly in regards event dating. What has been written and codified is not as important as what wa s not written or admitted. And the omissions, once rediscovered and understood, change everything we know about the history of Ireland and the world. In our opinion, the tale co n cerning the second visitation to Ireland is a spurious interpolation with no h i s torical veracity whatsoever. It was a cunning interpolation of Christian monks intended to insinuate an Eastern origin for the Irish. Kesair, we read, came to Ireland with a handful of people a mere forty days before the great flood sent by god. Allegedl y, she was a daughter of a son of Noah. The only part of that account we can agree with is the details concerning the great flood. W e accept wholeheartedly that such a deluge did occur in ancient times. The rest of the tale is nothing but a monkish concoct ion. After all, could this Kesair of the Christians and Jews be responsible for Ireland's innumerable astronomically aligned Megalithic sites? W e think not. One could make a case for the spuri o usness of other visitation accounts, particularly of Partholan and Nemed. The story of their arrival to Ireland (dated by the monks to 2520 BC) may be based on fact but there is something contrived about the accounts of their fate afte r ward. Conveniently, for the monkish mythmongers, and inconveniently for ev e ryone el se trying to make sense of ancient Irish history, both contingents - the Partholans and Nemedians - on completely separate occasions, are stricken with disease after their successful wars against the Fomorians. A short time after their arrival each group i s entirely decimated by plague. Not one man, woman, or child survived. And so their people exist only in story form. They came, they conquered, and then they tragically died. W as this the device used by those monks eager to manufacture the kind of dramatic history that would corroborate their bible?

Then - upon the same fatal first of May - there began a mysterious epidemic, which la s ted a week, and destroyed them all.

Both of them came from the mysterious regions of the dead, though later Irish accounts, which endeavoured to reconcile this mythical matter with Christianity, invented for them a descent from Scriptural p a triarchs and an origin in earthly lands such as Spain or Scythia - Thomas Rolleston ( Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race, 1911) The accounts that describe the Fomorian race, allegedly the first inhabitants of the British Isles, are also to be reapprais ed. The chroniclers speak of this cyclopean race but state that the Fomorian kings (Elathan and his son Breas) w e re the most beautiful of men. According to the various legends, the Fomorians (who were also known as the Men of Lochlann) lived on or under th e sea. As regards Ireland, they behaved like zealous and ruthless security guards.

At this remote time, Ireland consisted of only one treeless, grassless plain, watered by three lakes and nine rivers - Charles Squire ( Cel tic Myth and Legend ) W e can accept the idea of Ireland's nakedness once we accept that it was caused by the cataclysm that science has proven to have occurred approxim a tely 10,000 years ago. This terrific disaster, discussed at length in Atlantis, Alien Vi sitation, and Genetic Manipulation , was recorded in the legends of old and by the monks who collated the myths and legends of the British Isles. W hen a natural disaster wreaks havoc it destroys and kills and, if sufficiently violent, it will force people t o flee their habitats. The lands so afflicted are d e serted by those who have lost homes and settlements to tsunami, hurricane, typhoon, or volcano. Those who are so displaced are compelled to seek ref u ge in less ravaged regions. So, when we read that Irela nd was largely uninh a bited after the time of the biblical flood, we understand that it was inhabited before that destructive event took place. It might also be logical to suspect those indigenous occupants to be the same people who were displaced by the up heavals and who returned to their homes after a semblance of normalcy r e turned to their ancestral homes. This is exactly what happens today during a natural disaster and during its aftermath. It happens today and it happened in the past. Once we accept thi s simple premise we can make sense of the co n voluted stories composed by mythmongers regarding Ireland's prehistory. These deceptive writers sought to begin Ireland's history from the time of the returns. This falsity can no longer be accepted by anyone wi shing to research the West to East movement of the elements of civilization. Those monks who were busy editing Ireland's history were not interested in having their readers find out that advanced pre - diluvian civilizations existed long before the time posi ted for the biblical creation. And so they were compe l led to write their histories as we find them today. They were bound to present Ireland as an unpopulated country frequented by demonic titans who preferred to live on remote islands and high seas. And m ost importantly, they were bound to have the world believe that Ireland was first inhabited by migrants from the East. This deception has worked its magic. This is exactly what the vast majority of historians and interested parties believe about Ireland. W hat needs to be understood, and what we are adamantly convinced must be now disclosed to the world, is that these migrations from the East did indeed occur.

This is what we deduce from various legends. In this r e gard, at least, we can assume the records of battles between rival races, common to the m ythological cycle, to be generally accurate. The monkish chroniclers betray the fact that they did not know about the land bridges that once existed between Ireland and England, and England and Scandinavia. These land bridges existed up until 3000 BC when rising sea levels obliterated them. Satellite photography has recently confirmed the the o ries of the geologist, Professor Ulf Erlingsson, who set about proving the exi s tence of these bridges. His findings have had a most important effect on the false ideas concerning the remoteness of the British Isles. His scientific disc o veries verify that Britain was a part of Atlantis, and confirm our suspicions co n cerning the historical inversion perpetrated by the Christian monks who wished it to appear that Eastern m igrants had first colonized an unoccupied Ireland. As said, these monks were not inclined to accept or admit that the Earth had been host to advanced pre - diluvian civilizations, or that the Earth itself was over 4,000 years old. W hatever existed was mentio ned in the bible and there was little to add. W hat was written in the bible was all a monk had to know about his world. For the Christian there could be no Atlantis or Lemuria. There could be nothing that was not contained in the bible. The bible did speak of the giants and of titanic fallen angels, and so a scribe could permissibly claim the Formorians to be of such lineage. The bible did speak of technically endowed Adamites and Canaanites, and so a scribe could permissibly speak of the Iberians and Tuath a de Danann. If it corroborated the bible it was entered as hi s tory. If it did not corroborate the bible it would be skewed or suppressed and most likely never see the light of day. For these reasons, it is irrational to believe that the monkish scribes of Ireland have provided us with historically a c curate accounts concerning the world of the past. W e can merely endeavor to take on board the newly discovered scientific evidence about Ireland and its geographical tribulations and surmise what we have not be en told about Br i tain. Once we have an idea of what was omitted from the annals and chroni c les we can gradually reconstruct the facts about pre - diluvian Ireland. Three divine and heroic cycles of myths are known in Ireland, one telling of the Tuatha Dé Dan ann, the others of Cúchulainn and of the Fians. They are distinct in character and contents, but the gods of the first cycle often help the heroes of the other groups,"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"as the gods of Greece and India assisted the heroes of the epics. We shall see that some of the personages of these cycles may have been known in Gaul; they are reme m bered in Wales, but, in the Highlands, where stories of Cúchulainn and Fionn are still told, the Tuatha Dé Danann are less known...As the new Achaean religion in Greece and the Ved ic sacred books of India regarded the aboriginal gods and heroes as d e mons and goblins, so did Christianity in Ireland sometimes speak of the older gods there - J. A. MacCulloch ( The Religion of the Ancient Celts ) In our reappraisal, we conclude that the F omorians were Atlanteans. W e con c lude that the British Isles and Scandinavia were part of the Hyperborean or Atlantean civilization. The Fomorians were also known as the Men of Loc h lann. This is a reference to Norway, the land of lakes. Clearly, the Fomori ans had taken to the seas in order to survive the after - effects of the deluge but did not evacuate the North - W estern climes as other tribes had. They made use of whatever landmasses remained above the water level. They attempted, as best they could, to pol ice those lands that, though wrecked by disaster, would again be habitable. They attempted to aggressively repel any tribe or conti n gent trying to return and resettle on lands they claimed either by right or might. W e conclude that the Megalithic people, t he original inhabitants of Ireland, hu r riedly evacuated the torn lands by fleeing across the land bridges into Europe. Later, after a semblance of normality returned to the North - W est, the desce n dants of the indigenous but displaced inhabitants of Ireland and England made their way back across the same land bridges now lost beneath the waves of the Irish and North Sea. W hat we deny, and deny utterly, is that these indig e nous people (of whatever race) were visiting the British Isles from the East for the fir st time. W e adamantly maintain that the Partholans, Nemedians, and De Danann of the history books had occupied Ireland millennia before the \"Age of Catastrophe\" dispersed them to the corners of the world, and that they origin a ted in W estern climes. To the Eastern lands they went, taking with them their skills and expertise in so many areas. And there they may have remained for as long a period as 5,000 years. In that time they, as inveterate rovers and i n trepid explorers, visited France, Spain, Babylon, Syr ia, Africa, Egypt, China, and places further afield. W e believe they maintained settlements in the Indus Valley until the drying up of the great Saraswati River. Nowadays, not a month goes by without evidence coming forth confirming the presence of W estern men in the far off reaches of the world. The father of King Partholan was known as Sera. Although this word means \"W est,\" it was also the term Egyptians gave to their kings whom the Greeks and Romans referred to by the term \"pharaoh.\" In Punjabi, the term sera is close to the words for the \"sun\" ( surya ) and for \"lion\" ( shera ). W e conclude that the Partholans had frequented Egypt and were regarded as nobility there. The name of Partholan's father was actually his title. Partholan was probably the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"son of a p haraoh (possibly of the 2nd or 3rd dynasty); one whose ancestors went to Egypt from Ireland. Partholan is said to have come into Ireland from the West, where beyond the vast, u n sailed Atlantic Ocean the Irish Fairyland, the Land of the Living - i.e., the l and of the Happy Dead - was placed. His father's name was Sera (meaning - the West) - Thomas Rolleston ( Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race, 1911) For all these peoples, whether Hyperboreans, Cimmerians, Cimbrian, or even Tuatha de Danann are represented as belonging to a race of mysterious origins which lives at the ends of the earth and was supposedly driven from its original home. In mythological terms they are all Tuatha de Danann...The Tuatha de Danann were the ancient inhab i tants of Ireland who were forced to give way to the Gaels and to become the gods of Celtic imagination, the lords of the subterranean world. There is no doubt that the name Tuatha de Danann was given to the pre - Celtic inhabitants of Ireland and that it must have been they who built the megaliths. Their uncertain origins combined with their curious stone constructions give them a cloak of mystery...If the Celts drove out the megalithic peoples of Ireland, there is no reason why the same thing should not have happened on the continent , where much of the region occupied by the Celts still bears traces of megalithic monuments - Jean Markale ( The Celts ) Despite the best efforts of clerics and historians it is only the last group of i n vaders - the Milesians - who can positively be shown to have come to Ireland from the East for the first time. The story of the visitation of the Milesians is of central importance to our work. W e will explore it in greater detail in another chapter. W hat interests us is that these Milesians, the descendants o f Celts from Scythia, have been linked with the Israelites whose exodus from Egypt occurred after the fall of Akhenaton around 1300 BC. Historians date the Mil e sian invasion of Ireland to approximately 1000 BC, but we believe it to have occurred at a few h undred years earlier. This is because a daughter of Akh e naton, named Scota, is believed to have accompanied the Milesians on their journey to Ireland. Her real name was Meritaten and she (or a namesake daughter) is buried in Country Kerry. It is from the t ime of the Milesian invasion from the Eastern lands that Ireland's so - called \"Historical Cycle\" begins. A c cording to records and accounts the Milesians regarded their predecessors, the Tuatha De Danann, as nothing less than gods. By the Milesians and their descendants they were regarded as gods, and ultimately, in the imagination of the people, they became what are now in Ireland called 'Fairies.\" They conquered the Firbolgs, an Iberian or a Belgic people, at the battle of Moytura - ( Old Celtic Romances , 18 94, translated by P. W. Joyce) The meaning formerly given to Tuatha Dé Danann was \"the men of science who were gods,\" danann being here connected with dán, \"knowledge\" - J. A. MacCulloch ( The R e ligion of the Ancient Celts ) The 'Irish World Chronicles,' a s ection in The Annals of Inisfallen that covers the hist o rical period from the creation of the world to AD 432, says that the Tuatha de"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Danann were mythical masters of Ireland in around 1500 BC, before the arrival of \"the sons of Mil.\" - Maurice Cotterell ( Jesus, King Arthur and the Journey of the Grail ) The Tuatha - de - Dananns seem to have been a civilized people; besides possessing ships and armies and working in the metals, they had an organized body of surgeons, whose duty it was to attend upon the wounded in battle; and they had also a bardic or Druid class, to preserve the history of the country and the deeds of kings and heroes - Ignatius Donnelly ( Atlantis, the Antediluvian World ) Duplicitous historians, desperate to conceal the W estern origins of the D e Dannan, erroneously insist that they were related to the Danes, Trojans, or even to the biblical Tribe of Dan. They have also sought to arouse doubt as to whether the De Dannan magi of Ireland were of the Caucasian (Indo - European) Race. However, it is no t that the De Dannan were descended from the tribe of Dan but that the bible's Danites were related, either racially or ideologically, to the Irish De Dannan. In any case, after their final defeat at the hands of the Milesians (the Gaels), the De Danann tr ansmuted their physical form and thereby became the mysterious Sidhe (pronounced Shee ), or dei terreni (\"gods of the Earth\"), that is the Faerie Race who reputedly inhabited the inner Earth. Of all the beings in the Irish mythological world the Sidhe are, however, apparently the oldest and the most distinctive. Beside them in literature and general renown all other beings sink into insignificance. A belief in them formerly dominated the whole of Irish life. The Sidhe or Tuatha De Danann were a people like o urselves who inhabited the hills -- not as a rule the highest and most salient eminences, but I think more usually the pleasant undulating slopes or gentle hill - sides -- and who lived there a life of their own, marrying or giving in marriage, banqueting or mak ing war, and leading there just as real a life as is our own. All Irish liter a ture...abounds with reference to them - W. Y. Evans - Wentz ( The Fairy - Faith in Celtic Countries, 1911) Grianán an Aileach - (\"Stone House of the Sun\") - the massive site on the summit of Grianan Hill outside Derry City in Co. Donegal, is the supposed burial site of Lord Nuada, high king of the Tuatha de Danann The term tuatha (from the Old Irish root tuath ) does mean \"tribe.\" However, the term comes from the same root as thuaidh, meaning \"Northern\" or \"Northern Point.\" The De Danann were from the North - W est, as their own legends st a ted. They were the Hyperboreans and were clearly the ancestors of the so -"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"called Teutons (an early Germanic tribe). The word is also connotativ ely rel a ted to the Old Irish tuas or thuas meaning \"up\" or \"above;\" to tuaithe that sign i fied \"sorcerers\" or \"magicians;\" and to tuathgeinte meaning \"elven,\" or \"faerie,\" or \"blessed good folk.\" The term Danu relates to the Irish goddess of that n a me. She was a goddess of art, craft, and beauty. Some scholars prefer, ther e fore, to regard and describe the Tuatha de Danann as the \"People of Art\" or the \"Artful Ones.\" And we think this is an accurate title given the exquisiteness of their craftsmanship in silv er and stone. Col. Vallencey has proved, as clear as the sun at noon, that the ancient gods of the Greeks and Romans came from the Hyperboreans - Godfrey Higgins Such a great people were the De Danann, and so uncommonly skilled in the few arts of the time, that they dazzled even their conquerors and successors, the Milesians, into regarding them as mighty magicians. Later generations of the Milesians to whom were handed down the wonderful traditions of the wonderful people they had conquered, lifted them in to the mystic realm, their greatest ones becoming gods and goddesses, who supplied to their successors a beautiful mythology - Seumus McManus ( Story of the Irish Race ) According to their own lore (found in the Lebar Gabala , or \"Book of Invasions\") the De D anann were survivors from four paradisiacal Western (Atlantic) islands that either foundered or suffered enormous natural assault during a gr e at natural catastrophe or flood. These original homelands were called Falias, Murias, Gorias, and Finias. And it i s most curious that the island named Murias should be so similar in type to Lemuria . If we take the letter \"L\" to repr e sent \"the,\" then L'muria is undoubtedly the Murias of the De Danann. De Danann lore also speaks of several other enchanted isles that pla yed a major role in the adventures of their various heroes, kings, and gods. The chief chara c ters from the myths of the matriarchal Tuatha De Danann are: Danu - (Dana, Ana, Anu, chief goddess and \"Mother of the Gods\") Brigit - (or Bride, a later form of Da nu) Bel - (Bal, Bile, Baal , her consort) Ernmas - (grand - daughter of Nuada. A mother goddess. Morrigu, Fodla, Ba n ba, and Eri were her daughters) Nuada Airgetlam - (\"Nuada of the Silver Arm,\" the High King) Lugh - (The sun god, called Samildanach - \"Master of all the Arts\") Dadga - (god of plenty, similar to Hercules or Pluto) Manannan Mac Lir - (god of the sea, prototype for Poseidon and Neptune) Aengus - (son of Dagda Mor, he was the god of love and king of the Faerie) Midir - (god of the Underworld, of th e Sidhe, he was married to the most beautiful woman in the world, Etain.

Her name is derived from the Gaelic mor meaning \"great,\" or \"giant,\" and rigan , meaning \"queen\") Badb - (pronounced Baav , war queen, known as \"the Fury.\" Her name meant the \"vulture\" or \"battle crow\") Macha - (war queen, presumed buried at Ard Macha, or County Armagh) Boann - (wife of the Dagda, goddess of river s) The De Danann arrived to the shores of Ireland on the first day of May, the Irish Beltane, or \"Day of Bel,\" god of the Earth. W ith them they brought four specific treasures that were sacred symbols to their race. These treasures w e re: The Sword of Nuada - (known as \"Retaliator,\" it was the prototype for the Arthurian Excalibur The Lance of Lugh - (that operated on its own in battle) The Cauldron of the Dagda - (that was a pot of plenty that never ran dry) The Stone of Manannan Mac Lir - (also known as th e Lia Fail , or Stone of Fal) Interestingly, these four Irish - Druidic artifacts are understood to be the exact prototypes of the four suits found in the Tarot and traditional playing cards. These suits are known as the wands, swords, cups, and disks , or clu bs, sp a des, hearts, and diamonds. There were four cities in which the Tuatha Dé Danann learnt wisdom and magic...These are the names of the cities: Failias and Findias, Goirias and Murias. From Failias was brought the Lia Fail, which is at Tara, and which used to cry out under each king who assumed the sovereignty of Ireland. From Gorias was brought the sword which belo n ged to Nuada. From Findias was brought the spear of Lug. And from Murias was brought the caldron of the Dagda...No battle was maintained ag ainst the spear of Lug or against him who had it in his hand.

They spread \"druidically - formed showers and fog - sustaining sh o wer - clouds\" over the country, and caused the air to pour down fire and blood upon the Fir Bolgs, so that they were obliged to she lter themselves for three days and three nights - Charles Squire ( Celtic Myth and Legend ) According to the legends, the De Danann were obliged to fight wars against the resident Fomorians and Iberian Fir Bolg in order to gain control over the land. The con flict with the Fir Bolg commenced in W estern island in what is now Country Sligo. The De Danann and Fir Bolg were of the same race and after their combat Ireland was divided between them. It was on Midsummer Day that the opposing armies at last met. The pe ople of the go d dess Danu appeared in \"a flaming line\", wielding their \"red - bordered, speckled, and firm shields\". Opposite to them were ranged the Fir Bolgs, \"sparkling, brilliant, and fl a ming, with their swords, spears, blades, and trowel - spears\" - Charle s Squire ( Celtic Myth and Legend ) The Fir Bolg get their name from fir (meaning \"men\"), and bel (meaning \"fair\" or beautiful\"), or belos (meaning \"shining\" or \"bright\"). They may even have been worshippers of the primordial Irish god Bel. Given that this i s the origin of their name, it logically follows that the Bolg and their two related tribes, the Fir Gaileon and the Fir Domnann, had evacuated their ancient homeland and m a de their to those regions today known as Greece and Bulgaria. W e believe the word B ulgaria is derived from the name of the Fir Bolg. And some evidence exists to suggest that this Irish race did play a significant role in the develo p ment of that land's ancient culture. The letters \"B\" and \"V\" were often interchanged. Place names such as V olga may derive from Bolg . In order to co n ceal the real meaning of the name Bolg, duplicitous historians have translated the name as \"bags\" and idiotically labeled the Fir Bolg \"Men of the Bags.\" This is because the word bolg is close to terms denoting lon g trousers and also small boats made from leather. The great scholar Godfrey Higgins silenced this drivel and explained in his monumental works that the word bolg was rea l ly derived from a word meaning \"wisdom.\" To Higgins the Fir Bolg were the \"Men of W is dom.\" Upon this fact we concur. W e have little doubt that they w e re magi from the pre - diluvian epoch who had strayed as rovers into European lands but whose original homeland was Ireland (or Atlantis). The word bile signified a sacred tree and so it is pos sible the Fir Bolg, when their name is correctly translated, were known as \"Men of the Trees.\" This would equate them with the Druids and also with kingship, since the symbolism of kings and trees was closely related. ―Men Who Carried Leather Bags,‖ ―Men W ho Wore Trousers,‖ or the ―Tree Kings.‖ Which one of these titles sounds most likely to have distinguished a remarkable race of goddess worshippers"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"who ruled Ir e land for centuries from their beautifully positioned capital at Tara? The answer appears rather obvious. The incarnate god was probably representative of a god or spirit of earth, growth, or vegetation, represented also by a tree. A symbolic branch of such a tree was borne by kings, and perhaps by Druids, who used oak branches in their rites. King a nd tree would be connected, the king's life being bound up with that of the tree...The Irish bile or sacred tree, connected with the kings, must not be touched by any impious hand, and it was sacrilege to cut it down - J. A. MacCulloch ( The Religion of the Ancient Celts ) The word bolg may also be rendered belg , and since the letter \"B\" was often interchanged with the similar - sounding letter \"P,\" belg can be rendered pelg . The words bolg or belg , as we have said, could have been the origin of Bulg a ria. Pelg might be the origin of Pelasgian , the name of the ancestors of the Greeks. Grecian historians do admit that the Pelasgians, whoever they were, originated in Western climes. The Bolgs, Belegs, or Pelegs, may have been named after the sun god Bel, which is w hy they were called the \"shining\" or \"bright\" ones. It may derive from the fact that they were handsome in appe a rance. After all, the famous Helen of Troy was reported to be comely and r a diant. Yes, and her name is akin to Helios meaning the sun. She was b right and beautiful and was compared to the sun. That is what we suspect occurred with the Fir Bolg. The Fir Bolg divided Ireland into five provinces. These still exist today and are known as Ulster, Munster, Leinster, Connaught, and M e ath. Other words and place names that appear to have referenced the ancient god Bel, are Belfast , Beltaine, Baltic , and Palestine (from Pelishtim , meaning Philistines) According to texts dating from the eleventh century, the Tuatha De Danann's battle with the Fomorians (known in Gaelic as Mag Tuireadh na b - Fomorach because it was fought on the Northern plain of Moytura in County Sligo), pr o ved to be a different kettle of fish to that which occurred between them and the Fir Bolg. For one thing, it involved years of concerted me thodical preparation under the direction of the sun god Lugh. Apparently, the Fomorians were a devilish hybrid race, similar to the Titans, who had harassed every tribe that had attempted to seek refuge on Ireland. They had decimated the Children of Partho lan, who are allegedly buried in plague graves outside Dublin, and had harassed the Nemedians to the point of annihilation. The Iberians (Fir Bolg) were able to resist Fomorian assaults due to their larger numbers but had never successfully defeated them i n battle. The Fomorian princes had their headquarters on Tory Island north of Derry City in County Donegal (which "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"means \"place of the strangers\" or \"foreigners\"). Their name allegedly derives from the Gaelic famhair ), or W elsh foawr , meaning ―giant‖ and fr om fo (\"under\") muir (\"sea\"). However, the name probably derives from fo morio , meaning \"great ones.\" The name of their king, Elathan, has been connected to words that mean \"knowledge.\" W e conclude that the Fomorians were not from under the sea but from ci vilizations that had sunk beneath the sea. The legends state that two Fomorian kings, Marc and Conan, had built what is clearly described as \"a glass tower\" upon Tory I s land. From this tower they kept a close watch over the mainland by way of a magic cryst al lens. Although the majority of the kings and chiefs of the Fomorians were hideous in physical aspect, their king Elathan was considered the most beautiful of beings. His son Breas was also known as \"the Beautiful.\" Breas' mother was a De Danann and by way of her he had legitimate claim to the throne of the Children of Danu. After attaining the throne he sided with his father's race and hard pressed the De Danann by taxes and unfair judgments. His actions precipit a ted the final conflict between the sons of light and sons of darkness. The Tarot - first appears in Irish mythology. The prototypes of the Tarot suits were brought to Ireland from four lost islands, one of which was called \"Murias\" (Lemuria). The T a rot links Ireland's Elders (Druids) to Eg ypt ...in spite of Bres being so beautiful, his reign brought no great good luck to his people; for the Fomor, whose dwelling - place was beyond the sea, or as some say below the sea westward, began putting tribute on them, the way they would get them under their own rule. It was a long time before that the Fomor came first to Ireland; dreadful they were to look at, and maimed - Lady Gregory ( Gods and Fighting Men , 1904) For seven years Lugh had the De Danann practice and prepare for this Gaelic \"Mahabharata .\" The Fomorians were destroyed and the war queens of the De Danann, led by the Morrigu, pursued the Fomorians in the form of wolves and ravens until all were caught and slain. As a traditional poem on the war r e counts: Over his head is shrieking, A lean h ag, quickly hopping, Over the points of the weapons and shields; She is the gray - haired Morrígú During the war with the Formorians (that commenced in the sign of Scorpio at the eve of Samhain) the De Danann conjured the assistance of the Earth itself. The mountains, rivers, and lakes came to their assistance and obeyed the commands of the De Danann magi and poets:"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"\"We will hurl by our magic arts,\" replied Mathgan, the head sorcerer, \"the twelve mou n tains of Ireland at the Fomors.

The resulting megalithic conglomeration, although not well known, is one of the most a we inspiring in the world. Many of the sites have been desecrated and over the years local farmers have plundered the various De Danann tombs of their large rocks and stones in order to bolster the walls between their past u res and for the building of nearb y houses and churches. The area near the town of Cong, not far from the battle fields, is honeycombed with underground rivers, tunnels, and caves. These locations have been considered sacred haunts of the Faerie and the preternatural Sidhe. Megalithic stru ctures of almost every kind are found among them - stone cairns with dolmens in their interiors, dolmens standing open and alone, dolmens surrounded by one, two, or three circles of stones, and circles without dolmens - to the number of over a hundred. Six ty - four of such prehistoric remains stand together upon an elevated pl a teau not more than a mile across, and make the battle - field of Moytura, though the least known, perhaps the most impressive of all primeval ruins.

Her vision and words are uncannily similar to those preserved by the Skalds in the Norse Edda, and by the Hindus in the post Vedic Puranas : Then she added a prophecy in which she foretold the approaching end of the divine age and the coming of a new one, in which the summers would be flowerless, the cows milkless and women shameless and men strengthless, in which there would be tress without fruit and seas without fish, when old men would give false judgments and legisl a tors would make unjust laws, when warriors would betray one another and men would be thieves and there would be no more virtue in the world - (Prophecy of Badb, war queen of the Tuatha De Danann) Then saw she wade in heavy streams, men - foul murde rers and perjurers, and them who others wives seduce to sin, brothers slay brothers; sisters‘ children shed each others' blood.

The ancient Irish, being inherently romantic and spiritual, believed their land to be a living goddess referred to as Ari or Eri. In various myths, where this goddess and others appear and speak, they do so as personifications of the land itself. This mythological idiosyncrasy did not originate with the Greeks and their Demeter or with the Hindus and their Prakriti. It came from Ireland, the \"Land of Forests\" ( Inis na ffidbadh ). To be specific, in Irish mythology the land did not bear the name of one goddess but three. Ireland was named after Eri, and two related queen goddess named Fodla and Banba. This convention of three tutelary gods, goddesses, or chieftains, was emulated by the Egyptians whose nomes, or sacred cities along the Nile, were always d e dicated to a triplicity of gods.

This world Pteira refers to Ireland and its inhabitants with whom the Hittites, Syrians, Phoeni cians, Minoans, and Sumerians, were related.

They were believed to be an offshoot of the so - called \"Hamitic\" ethnic group that, according to theologians, originated with Ham the son of Noah. The Egyptians and Canaanites, among other Asian and Mediterrane an groups, were considered racially Hamitic, that is descended from Ham the son of Noah who was believed to have been the progenitor of all African peoples. This consensus was finally proven to be unsusta i nable academic nonsense and was rejected as a sympt om of the colonialist mindset that notoriously and prejudiciously categorized certain races and tribes as \"inferior\" and \"recalcitrant.\" The preposterous travesty is clarified once it is understood that the term Ham i tic originally referred to Egypt and it s non - Semitic inhabitants. One of the earliest names for Egypt was Ham , and also Kham . The Hamites were, ther e fore, Egyptians and not some indefinite Semitic group. One would have wi s hed that the scholars who eventually refuted the Hamitic myth would also have rectified the Aryan myth and discarded the racial intonation of this sorely mis u sed term. The next theory to gain popularity during the early twentieth century declared the Aryans to be those tribes that originated at the Danube River Valley, the Balk ans, or in the land known as Cappadocia, in modern Turkey.

The Israelites and Judites were conglomerated groups closely affiliated with and probably blood - related to the Hyksos pharaohs of old, a fact confirmed by top Jewish historians. Thanks to the researches of Sigmund Freud, Comyns Beaumont, L. A. W a d dell, Ahmed Osman, Ralph Ellis, and Moustafa Gadalla, the true identity of the Israelites has finally come out into the open. Obviously, the fact that the all e ged ancestors of the Jews were racially Indo - European, and of the same racial stock as the anta gonists defamed and condemned in the name of spurious racial superiority, has poignant ramifications. It assists us to immediately and swiftly restore the grievously abused term \"Aryan.\" The term has simply been dragged through the mud by perfidious fools of the same race as the \"Israel i tes\" whom they gullibly believe to be \"inferior.\" Now that the hydrochloric acid of reason has been applied, now that the term has been thoroughly excavated from its bed of filth, its true unadulterated and original meaning may be disce r ned beneath the crud of generations.

W hat did race matter after the Age of Catastrophe when both the human race and the fauna had suffered incomprehensible decimation, the likes of which boggle scientific minds? Are we really to believe that traumatized survivors of plague, famine, earth upheavals, and global ruin, were in the habit, after all they had been through, of imagining themselves superior to other unfortunate humans in the same mess? It is ridiculous to believe so, and we would do well to realize the fraudulence of people advocating this idea. W hat mattered during the aftermath of ruin was that the gods were angry and vengeful. And naturally survival was a prime concern. It would hardly be different today should a universal catastrophe of such proportions ever occur.

The Druids: Priestarchy of the World Opposite to the coast of Gallia Celtica there is an island in the ocean, not smaller than Sicily - lying to the north, which is inhabited by the Hyperboreans, who are so named because they dwell beyond the north win d. This island is of a happy temperature, rich in soil, and fruitful in every thing, yielding its produce twice in the year. Tradition says that Latona was born there, and for that reason they venerate Apollo more than any other god. They are in a manner h is priests, for they daily celebrate him with continual songs of praise, and pay him abundant honors - Diodorus Siculus (Greek Historian, 90 - 30 BC) The word Druid has been mistranslated as referring to oak trees and their v e neration. In fact, the Druids co nsidered the rowan to be the greatest of trees, but all of nature was sacred to them. They were nature‘s students, healers, and caretakers. The word has several probable related origins. Most likely it derives from the Gaelic draeidh (pronounced dhree ) meaning \"kindred;\" or from druvid that means \"one who knows\" or \"one who has knowledge.\" The suffix vid (also wid ) is the root of wizard and wise.

Pliny thought that the name \"Druid\" was a Greek appellation derived from the Druidic cult of the oak. The word, however, is purely Celtic, and its meaning probably implies that, like the sorcerer and medicine - man everywhere, the Druid was regarded as \"the knowing one.\" It is composed of two parts - dru - , regarded by M.

The Ash was a prominent tree in Drui dism. The Ash was connected with the element fire, and therefore with purification. The original birthday of Jesus was positioned by the church's mythmongers in the month of July. This was to align the birth of Jesus (the sun) with the rising of the star S irius. Eventually, however, the birthday was moved to D e cember in order to occlude the connection between the Christian Jesus and the Egyptian Osiris The first letter of the name Jehovah is probably derived from the Irish letter Jodh that is the origin o f the Hebrew Yod , the first letter of god's name. This letter Jodh or Yodh (the Greek Iota ) gives our modern letters \"I\" and \"J.\" The Irish Druids associated this letter with the tree we refer to as the Yew (from Yeu or Yodh ). From this word we derive Jul, Jew, and also Yule meaning Christmas, or the time of the winter solstice. Druidic symbolism extends to key passages of the Old Testament.

The taller and thinner variety of yew (similar to the cyp ress), known as fastigiata, grew abundantly throughout Western Ireland and was sacred to the ancient warrior queen and goddess of the Tuatha de Danann, Banbha, after whom Ireland was once named. Botanists believe all other Yews in the world to be descended from two Irish trees. County \"Mayo\" comes from the word meaning \"yew forest.\" Interestingly, the most sacred Egyptian groves, orchards, and temple precincts appear to have had these Irish yews in pride of place. According to Ralph Ellis, the yew was the E gyptian's original \"Tree of Life,\" and it featured prominently in Egypt's most sacred mystery school traditions and initiatory rites. It was a symbol of death and underworld rites. The oldest implements in the world, dating to over 50,000 years ago were ma de of yew wood. The tree may have been considered sacred because it poisoned all animals that ate of its bark or leaves except the stag and deer. The deer and stag were supremely sacred to the Irish Druids. The Yew can still frequently be found in British churchyards. Given that the Yews are older than Christian churches, it follows that Christian churches and cathedrals were deliberately positioned near to the tree for symbolic purposes.

The biblical \"Levites\" adopted the old Druidic title as their own, either because they had descended from western Druids directly or because they we re initiates and adepts from Druidic colleges.

So who or what were the \"Serpents\" that were cast out by Christianity? The Druids held the symbols of the serpent and the dragon in the highest esteem and considered them insignias of royalty.

This is because there is a world of difference between physical snakes and the symbols of dragon s or serpents. \"W ise Serpent\" refers to th o se who were initiated into the highest mysteries. It signified those who posse s sed healing abilities and great knowledge of astronomy and astrology. The Magi of Ireland were expert architects and they had the most intimate conne c tion to flora and fauna. Like the pharaohs of Egypt they were semi - enlightened beings who lived in harmony with each other and with nature. They obeyed nature's superordinate laws and knew well the penalties for breaching them. The druids were the exclusive intellectual elite, and were recruited among the ranks of the nobility. They enjoyed special privileges, such as exemption from tributes and were not obliged to bear arms coins...Their education was very lengthy, and involved twenty years of memorizing sacred texts which religious taboo banned from being put in writing...In their religious role, the druids insured the conduct of religious practices, pr e sided over sacrificial rites, and received and interpreted omens.

No country in Europe is so associated with the Serpent as Ireland, and none has so many myths and legends connected with the same.

This is only one small example of the tampering and disto r tion that has taken place to the bible and so many other great texts that would have served mankind to have a truer understanding of the world and of the past had they been left intact. The Talmud also contradicts the gospels in some essential points concerning Jesus. For instance, it never men tions that he was a Galilean or came from the city of Naz a reth.

In our e stimation, there is little doubt that the astonishing accounts of Christian miracle healings and banishings - from the wizardry of Moses in the wilderness to the raising of the dead talent of Jesus to the feats of St. Patrick and St. Columba - were deliber ately concocted and added to the Christian c a non in order to outdo the legacy of the Druids.

Indeed, as Beaumont asserts, they adapted their own customs and theological lineaments from Druidism. Speaking of the status of the high Druid, Beaumont wrote: His ecclesiastical power being far greater than that of the Papacy in its heyday, he claimed to speak with the direct authority of God as the Pope does yet on matters of doctrine. The Celtic Hierarch called himself the Living God, and, pretending to divine power, ruled with all temporal and ecclesiastical control as he saw fit. Reade says of the Pontifex Maximus of Rome: \"The office was probably an imitation of the Arch - Druid, who had supreme power over secul ar as well as ecclesiastical affairs, and who was surrounded by a Senate of the chief Druids, as the Pontifex Maximus was by Flamines, and the Pope by Cardinals - ( The Riddle of Prehistoric Britain )"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 .

These academies were the prototypes for those of later ages, at Iona, Nineveh, Tyre, Carthage, Alexandria, Pergamon, Athens, Sparta, Ephyra, Benares, Thebes, and elsewhere. These colleges were presided over by the Servants of Truth - those Elders who have since become known as the \"Druids.\" These Elders were men and women with expertise in astronomy, astrology, architecture, medicine, music, poetry, and metaphysical philosophy.

The more deeply we study the question of the Druids, the more it enlarges, and the greater becomes its importance. We arrive at the first conviction that behind the community of Gaulish or Celtic priests, of which Caesar, Diodorus, and Strabo have pop u larized the name, is hidden an old social institu tion, which, from the highest antiquity, made its civilizing influence felt, outside of Gaul, Ireland, and Scotland, in Wales, Sca n dinavia, Germany, among the Aestiens, the Celts of the Upper Danube, the Getes, and more particularly, in Thrace...The Pythagor ean brotherhoods and the institutions of Numa constitute, we believe, one of the unrecognized aspects of these ancient cenobitic communities, of which our convents, monasteries, and abbeys became the su c cessors – Alexandre Bertrand (quoted in Druidism the Ancient Faith of Britain , by Dudley Wright, 1924) ...there is also an international dimension...to druidic activity...if we think of Caesar's statement...that the Gauls believed that Druidism was discovered in Britain, and that those wishing to perfect their knowl edge of the discipline travel there in order to do so, we must accept the fact of its boundary - less quality.

Lonigan ( The Druids: Priests of the Ancient Celts , 1996) The D ruids, who united in a Society, occupied themselves with profound and sublime questions, raised themselves above human affairs, and sustained the immortality of the soul - Ammianus Marcellinus (pagan military leader for Christian Emperor Julian) Purificati on by fire for body and soul, and assimilation thereby to the purest essence of the universe, were the fundamental ideas of their creed - the infallible means of the hi g hest and most acceptable apotheosis - Dr. H. Waddell Besides the purely spiritual belie fs, they permitted a material worship for the people. They permitted the adoration of God that which the ancients named the Elements - L a mariouze (On the Gaulish Druids) Like the later Freemasons, who appropriated their symbolic tropes, the ancient Druids venerated the number three and tripartite metaphysical principles. From the earliest days of the Irish the custom was for three kings to simult a neously govern. This is a phenomenon we find employed in Egypt where each of the fourteen or more nomes, or sacr ed cities, along the Nile were ruled over by a trinity of gods. The Druids, like the Celts who came after them, were also very conscious of the dual nature of things.

It was only later that the pretender solar church o f Rome decided to abolish the logic of the dualist metaphysic and divide the sides of one personality into two separate and distinct entities forever adverse to one another and never to be reconciled. The consequences of this phil o sophic travesty are seen throughout the world we live in. The travesty has r e placed and over - written the sublime gnosis of the Druids and the teachers of truth, and has served the masters of darkness and lies. Proto - astrology was not premised upon a solar theology since the sun on its annual rotation physically and symbolically equates with ephemerality and w a nes, with time and evolution through time. The twelve signs were seen as twelve aspects of consciousness. They represented the innate categories of consciousness. The sun stan ds for the human ego, and the ego was the a r chetypal \"hero\" who must pass through the twelve \"school rooms\" before he can be pure and wise enough to know the secrets of the universe. The Stellar Cult understood that the personal horoscope is a projection o f one's inner r e public, so to speak. It is a life - map delineating the strengths and weaknesses we possess, and an external representation of the interaction between our Dharma and Karma, between the masculine and feminine modalities of being, and of the in teraction of psychic and physical energy. To the Stellar Cult the sun was not considered the center of the zodiac because the ego was not considered the center of human consciousness. The properties of the sun, analogous to the properties of the ego, were not as revered as they are today. It was understood, by the ancient magi, that the light of ego - consciousness was not sufficient to illumine all the mysteries of the self. To cast a beam of light onto something only ensures that everything that is not with in that beam is cast into darkness. Light may highlight and clearly reveal one small area but must, as a result, cast all else into shadow. Metaphysically, the situation is exactly the same. If we find ourselves in ignorance today, about almost ev e rything that matters, there is a reason. The reason has to do with the machin e ry and mechanics of light. As the sun literally draws a veil of light across the body of the mysteries (the night sky and the stars) so the human ego (our \"i n ner sun\" so to speak) also d raws a veil of psychic luminescence over our true inner essence and source. W e have little idea what this means today because we have been indoctrinated, even intimidated, by thousands of years of J u deo - Christianity and the orthodox hegemonies of those ali gned and obsessed with \"solar propaganda.\" Those subscribing to this anti - human ideology tend to regard women, nature, quiet, and darkness as suspect, threatening, and even evil."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"  The solar halo - Its origin is Egyptian.

Rem s berg ( The Christ ) I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star - (Rev 22:16) As late as the fifth and sixth cen turies, the words \"Our Lord, the Sun\" were used by the Christians in their prayers. This same phrase was also used in the liturgy until altered later into \"Our Lord, the God\" - Bozena Brydlova ( Io Unveiled ) The Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the Sun, in which they put a man whom they call Christ, in the place of the Sun, and pay him the same adoration which was originally paid to the Sun - Thomas Paine Once we understand the hermetic devises used by the biblical mythographers to encode zod iacal symbolism we will finally find sanity in the testaments. W e will see the metaphors for what they are and acknowledge the Druidical and astrological origins of Christianity. From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day. Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.

Astrologically speaking, when the sun enters each sign or house of the zodiac it takes on a different metaphysical aspect. Even during the course of a single day the sun posse s sed three important aspects. It was young at the Eastern horizon, full grown at midday, and old and wise at sunset. These facets of a single entity were i n corporated into the story of the Sun King who represented the powers of the sun upon the Earth. As the sun was the center of heav en so the king was the center of his tribe or nation. The priests worshipped the solar facets and took to personifying them as separate gods or deities although they never forgot that it was one being, and one concept, that was ultimately being revered. As every \"disciple\" would have perceived the biblical Jesus differently, so it was with the ancients and their chief. As modern Christians accept a tripartite division of godhead (God, the Son, and the Holy Spirit) so did the ancients understand that there w ere many facets to the king of light. As the sun has three aspects (rising, midday, and setting) so did the Sun King also have three faces.

The biblical patriarch Isaac is a clear rendition of Iesa, the Irish god of light Ireland had its own autochthonous (home - grown) solar religion and church. Theirs was the original solar church and theocracy, most probably transported from the pre - diluvian civilizations from which the ancient Irish had descended. The evidence for this exists but has been cunningly concealed for centuries by the imposter Roman (Vatican) hierarchs and their agents. That Irish Church of the Sun, the original Chris tianity, had its own Pontiff entitled \"Crios\" or \"Christos,\" and its own Druidic customs rites and beliefs. These were of such i m mense antiquity and profundity that all other cultures in the world awed them.

They went the way of the great libraries such as at Pergamon (\"of Amon\"), Byblos, Carthage, and Alexandria. The Irish church had its own sun god and sun king, and personified the powers of the universe through the he a venly bodies - the sun, moon, and stars. This is where word s like \"minister,\" \"deacon,\" \"sexton,\" and \"magistrate,\" etc, come from. It would appear probable that the religion of the Druids passed from Ireland to England and France. The metempsychosis or transmigration of souls was one of the articles of their beli ef long before the time of Pythagoras; it had probably been drawn from the storehouse of Atlantis, whence it passed to the Druids, the Greeks, and the Hindoos.

The state of learning on the continent of Europe at that time, wherever the influence of the Roman Churc h was dominant, was at a very low state or non - existent. It was only in the monastic establishments maintained at different points on the continent by the monks of the Irish Church that learned men were to be found. There were practically no learned men in the Roman Church at that time. Even a century later when the Emperor Charlemagne espoused the cause of the Roman Church, he had to get Irish schoolmen for instructors to teach in the palace school which he established - Conor MacDari ( The Bible: An Irish Book ) While it is acknowledged that the renaissance of learning on the continent of Europe in the early medieval period was due to Irish instruction and culture, this acknowledg e ment comes only in outspoken candor from German rather than from British or R oman sources.

The title \"Christ\" is probably a variant of Crios, and since both the Irish and the Egyptians designed their temples based on the zodiacal circle and cross, the tradition passed into Christianity. In the Celtic mysteries of the Druids, the temple of initiation was either oval, to repr e sent the mundane egg...or circular, because the circle was the symbol of the universe; or cruciform, in allusion to the four elements, or constituents of the universe. The I s land of Lewis, in Scotla nd, has one combining the cruciform and circular form. There is a circle, consisting of twelve stones, while three more are placed in the east, and as many in the west and south, and thirty - eight, in two parallel lines, in the north, forming an avenue to t he circular temple.

Eventually, during the hegemony of the Solar Cult, the title meant not only \"circle\" but \"sun.\" Christian saints a re often shown with glowing halos while carrying cruciform staffs. In Egypt the staff was rendered as a shepherd's crook that was a symbol for the pharaohs, the Druids of Egypt. The pharaohs wore the serpent on their headgear and the serpent was the symbol of the Magi of Ireland, the Naddreds, or Druids. The Druids revered the zodiac above all things. Most of their legends are metaphors for star lore, and encapsulate celestial phenomena such as the movement of the planets and luminaries (the sun and moon) a long the ecliptic. The Druidic knowledge of astromancy was transcribed by the Bards (Poets), Ovates (Speakers), and Mins t rels (Singers) into songs, tales, and legends of \"historical\" personalities with no physical existence. The idea was always that mortal s should model themselves on these fictional but archetypal renditions.

According to Druidic tradition his life - blood healed the Earth. It purified and revivified the land allowing a new season's abundance.

The ancients of India referred to the British Isles as Britashtan, a word tha t meant \"Seat of Religion.\" Iesa's aspects were worshipped under various names depending upon the culture and the facet that was being vener a ted.

This sect is on record as the first followers of Jesus (also called Joshua - \"the Savior\") whom they believed was not the official Jewish Messiah but a teacher who lived hundreds of years previously . Bishop Epiphanius referred to them by the name Jesseans and said they were followers of Jesus. They were allegedly a hard core branch of the Nazarene Church that opposed the elite Sadducees and their Jerusalem Temple. However, there is considerable doubt as to whether the Essenes were really Jewish. W e suspect they were a sect, like the Stoics, that preserved Druidic precepts. This is the reason why the Vatican sought to delay publication of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In any case, it was as an agent for the hi gh priest of the temple at Jerusalem that Paul tracked down and persecuted Christians. The Sadducees and their agents, h o wever, took their orders and direction from the Roman invaders. Officially, the Gnostics were Gentile Christians and Essenes were alleg edly Jewish Christians. Both groups believed that Jesus had lived centuries before the orthodox enclaves were insisting in the bible. And both groups knew that the Christ archetype was not their own creation or concept. It was for these reasons that the h ierarchs of the early Church in Rome decided to persecute and eradicate these sects and, in more recent times, tried to ban and sequester their various texts (the Dead Sea Scrolls and Gnostic Gospels, etc). Vatican - appointed priests and agents were on site to monitor every stage of the translation of the apocryphal Dead Sea Scrolls after their disc o very in 1947.

During the Middle Ages the passage was rendered slightly differently. In the Vulgate of the period the passage read: ...a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise up... Jesus the Messiah is the flower to rise up from the branch or tree of Jesse. Jesse was the Old Testament patriarch of royal lineag e. He was the father of King David. This line of descent is known to Christians as the \"Tree of Jesse.\" Of course we understand what is being concealed behind the name of the spurious ancestor and the imagery of the tree. Jesse is a rendition of the Dru i di c Iesa, of Esa, the first sun god. The image of the \"Tree of Jesse\" was very popular throughout the medieval period. After the 12th century it was pictorial i zed in numerous stained glass windows and illuminated manuscripts. In many cases the shoot that ris es to heaven from the Earth is held by the Virgin Mary. In all cases, the body or face of Jesus is seen at the top of the tree. The tree was often depicted growing out of the giant body of Jesse who lies on the ground sleeping. These particular images of t he reclining Jesse are remini s cent of images that depict the Egyptian Earth god Geb. This is especially true when the artist depicts the tree emerge from Jesse's genital area. Two beaut i ful versions of the \"Tree of Jesse\" image can be seen at Chartres Cath edral in Northern France, and in the center of the rose window of the Church of St. Denis in Paris, although the image is to be found in churches all over Europe, as well as in many illustrated bibles. The Tree of Jesse - images from All Saints Chu rch in Hove, Sussex (dated 1924), and from Torun, Poland (dated 1380 AD) Druidic motifs, such as the vine, tree, cross, and stone, abound in the bible. The concept of sacrif i ce, death, and renewal, are Druidic in origin. The image of Jesse sleeping reminds us of the Egyptian god Geb. From Geb came the phallic obelisk.

The idea of three wise men or kings is astrological and Druidic in origin. The four animals depicted around the Christ r epresent the four cardinal signs of the zodiac. The three wise men, shepherds, or kings, represent the constellation of Orion through which the soul of \"great kings\" was believed to incarnate and then depart. The figure of the Virgin Mary represents the ni ght sky. This particular artist suggests the round of the zodiac by the circular hem of the Madonna's cloak. Christ is the sun born into the sign of Virgo, the Virgin. Joseph, the \"Carpenter\" looks up toward the heavens. He is contemplating the signs, and represents the ancient gnosis suppressed by the Church of Rome. In Egyptian the word for \"carpenter\" was Setepenre . This word was one of the titles for a pharaoh. Jesus was indeed of a pharaonic bloodline, as the painting figuratively connotes. The man sta nding at the back right carrying the lamb represents the Cult of Atonists who observed the sun's move from the sign of Taurus into Aries. The ass or donkey is still used as a symbol today in US politics. The ass represents the god Set and the Hyksos Kings of Lower Egypt. The bull represents the Amenists of Upper Egypt, as well as the Irish Druids. The Roman c o lumns emphasize Jesus' Roman ancestry. "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 .

As we are slowly beginning to realize, these dates are not the true beginning of mankind's cultural and technical history. Herodotus himself is on record as having been told by contemporary Egyptian priests that their written records went back no less than 12,000 years. Eusebius, the early Christian bishop of Alexandria, calculated Manetho's recorded history as taking Egypt's civilization back 35,525 years...Other r e cords (both cultural and historical) were far more ancient still - John Gordon ( Egypt: Child of Atlantis ) The perceptive researcher realizes t hat there were extremely advanced civilizations in existence thousands of years previous to these untenable official dates.

In the \"principal deposit\" of the temple of Nekhen they found important ceremonial Protodynastic artifacts such as the Narmer Palette and the f a mous macehead bearing the name of King Scorpion - (Wikipeda Online Encyclopedia) not meant to believe in ante - diluvian civilizations. But what happens if we do look back this far? W hat happens if we do find evidence that proves that man was \"civilized\" aeons before 11,000 years ago? Certainly, it does not take a lot of investigating or proof to understand that great civilizations of the world could not just bl ossom into existence with all kinds of fully - fledged customs, idioms, and techniques, but with no antecedent stages that must have existed. Particularly, in the case of predynastic Egypt, we marvel at the construction of the great pyramid, the Osirieon, an d temples of Karnak and Luxor, etc, but cannot account for the technology that built them. Author, and expert on Egypt, Ralph E l lis clarifies the contentious but revealing issue for us: ...the early craftsmanship and constructions from the Old Kingdom are the finest, and the quality of and dimensions of each monument reduces then on throughout the following millennia...there were a number of magnificent monuments that were made during mankind's early megalithic era. These include monuments as diverse as St on e henge and Avebury in England, Teotihuacan in Mexico, Chou - Chou in Manchuria, Hagar Qim in Malta, Baalbek in Lebanon, Ephyra in Greece, Cuzco in Peru, Giza in Egypt, and the Osireion at Abydos. Despite the geographic diversity of these monuments, they al l share some common features - they were built in the prehistoric era; they were all a s sociated with religious centers; they were all made from megalithic architecture; they were mostly exquisitely carved and manufactured (often bafflingly so); and last bu t ce r tainly not least, all of these monuments were utterly devoid of inscription...The granite megaliths carved into a giant jigsaw puzzle at Cuzco, and the 1,000 tonne bricks that were being used at Baalbek, would stretch any modern stone mason's imaginat ion and skills to their limits....these temples were not dedicated to any one particular monarch, nor to any one particular god. They were, instead, dedicated to the observation and the study of the Universe - ( Eden in Egypt ) Although equally magnificent t emples and megaliths exist in Ireland, Scand i navia, North America, and Mexico, although entire lost cities are found ben e ath the oceans, and although the vast majority of words, place names, and personal names in the bible, are of Irish origin we would rat her live with myst e ries and unsolvable conundrums than face the actual truth. In almost every case where a major site exists, or where a great civilization existed, we find the same refrain from the modern inhabitants. Either we are told that \"godlike stra ngers\" erected the sites, or that technically superior semi - divine ancestors, of whom we now suspiciously find no trace, did it.

It is almost comical to say that we can be ce r tain that Ireland played a seminal role merely b ecause the laws of exclusion are in its favor.

Dare we examine the evidence f or the Irish or i gins of civilization and have done with the damnable conundrums? ...the ancient Egyptians were fully aware of the 25,920 - year cycle of the precession of the equinoxes. The idea, however, that a nomadic group of hunter - gatherers about 5,000 to 6,000 years ago should suddenly within the space of a few hundred years (or even a millennium), from merely watching the night sky but without using any instr u mentation, be able to quickly develop the requisite mathematical and scientific kno w ledge to v erify such a hypothesis is patently ludicrous - John Gordon ( Egypt: Child of Atlantis ) One of the most important finds within the land of Egypt occurred when the Egyptologist and archaeologist Professor W alter B. Emery (1903 - 1971) was excavating tombs at t he necropolis of Saqqara, one of the oldest cities in the land. There Professor Emery discovered men with blond hair and fair compl e xions. These individuals were revered and honored by the Egyptians as sp e cially endowed elite. Authors Vittorio Di Cesare an d Adriano Forgione write about Emery's enigmatic discoveries in their article Malta: Skulls of the Mother Goddess: ...the famous Egyptologist, author of \"Archaic Egypt\"...discovered the remains of ind i viduals who lived in the pre - dynastic epoch. These pres ented a dolichocephalous skull, larger than that of the local ethnic group, fair hair and a taller, heavier build. Emery declared that this stock wasn't indigenous to Egypt but had performed an important sacerdotal and governmental role in this country. Th is race kept its distance from the co m mon people, blending only with the aristocratic classes and the scholar associated them with the Shemsu Hor, the \"disciples of Horus\"...The Shemsu Hor are recognized as the dominant sacerdotal caste in pre - dynastic Egy pt (until approximately 3000 B.C.), being mentioned in the Turin papyrus and the list of the kings of Abydos. Professor Emery wrote of his finds in his book, Archaic Egypt: Culture and C i vilization in Egypt Five Thousand Years Ago: Towards the end of the I V millennium B.C. the people known as the Disciples of Horus appear as a highly dominant aristocracy that governed entire Egypt. The theory of the existence of this race is supported by the discovery in the pre - dynastic tombs, in the northern part of Highe r Egypt, of the anatomical remains of individuals with bigger skulls and builds than the native population, with so much difference to exclude any hypothetical common racial strain. The fusion of the two races must have come about in ages that concurred, m ore or less, with the unification of the two Egyptian Kin g doms...The racial origin of these invaders is not known and the route they took in their penetration of Egypt is equally obscure"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"...we find that at the dawn of the historic period Egypt was divided into the two rival kingdoms of the North and the South, both ruled by a royal house and aristocracy of the same race and both known traditionally as the \"Followers of Horus\" - the demigods of Manetho's history According to the ancient tablets, known as The History of Thoth: The Atlant e an, the Shemsu Hor (or Disciples of Horus), were a race of enlighteners who dwelt on ten pre - diluvian islands. One of their magi was the god Thoth, known by the Greeks as Hermes, and by the Romans as Mercury: Great were my peo ple in the ancient days, great beyond the conception of the little p e ople now around me; knowing the wisdom of old, seeking far within the heart of infinity knowledge that belonged to Earth's youth. Wise were we with the wisdom of the Chi l dren of Light who dwelt among us. Strong were we with the power drawn from the eternal fire. And of all these, greatest among the children of men was my father, Thoth, k e eper of the great temple, link between the Children of Light who dwelt within the temple and the races of men who inhabited the ten islands. The term shemsu derives, most probably, from the Akkadian shamash me a ning \"serpent.\" The word is very like the Irish Shamus or Seamus, or English James . W e believe the term Hor (for Horus the falcon or hawk - headed god of the sun) represented the Ari or Aryans. The letter \"H\" was often used in the same way as \"The\" or as \"Le\" in French. Therefore, Har or Harri was \"The Ari.\" The eagle or hawk was the symbol of the sun and of the enlightened ones of old. As a symbol, it p rimarily and originally signified spiritual status. (The name Harris or Harrison , from har , meant \"hawk\" or \"Son of the Hawk\"). Expert on Egypt Ralph Ellis has found evidence supporting the idea that the Giza Plat e au and its three great pyramids were perpe tually protected by a special guard known as the Horites. These Horites, although disparaged in the bible, are b e lieved to be associated with the mysterious city of Petra located near Mount Seir. Petra dates from a relatively late period but was probably b uilt upon a more ancient site. Nearby are sophisticated irrigation systems and a strange serpent mound identical to those found in France and Britain. There can be little doubt that the Horites were descended from the ancient Shemsu Hor, the Disciples of H orus. The word root Har signified the hawk, and the god Horus. The term is still employed today. A good example is the Air Force jet known as the \"Harrier.\" The first version of As said, the root har or hor refers to Horus and the sun. Ellis maintains that this mysterious sect of specially appointed guards was despised by the Hyksos people who were none other than the Israelites of the bible (see Volume Two). He also maintains that one of the ancient names f or Great Pyramid was Seir , a word that appears to connote the West (see Sera, Asur,"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"the war pl a ne was even known as the \"Hawker.\" Aser, Osiris, Abu Sir, and Syria , etc). If Mr. Ellis' translations are correct, as we believe them to be, then could not Mt. Horeb of the bible refer to the pyramids of the desert rather than to some other ill - defined and spuriously remote location? W as the pyramid the mountain of light or, more co r rectly, the mountain of the men of light ? In the year 1907, the Egyptian government decided to raise the level of the great Asw an Dam, in Southern Egypt, by seven meters. The project meant the destruction, by flooding, of acres of land containing many burial grounds and tombs. A hurried examination of the bodies from some Nubian tombs was m a de by Sir Grafton Elliot Smith who soon discovered, to his amazement, that the skulls and bones of the bodies under examination were different from those of the inhabitants of both Nubia and Egypt, even though there were Egy p tian characteristics to the physiognomy. In his book The Royal Mummies, pu b lished in 1912, Smith wrote of his strange alien finds: The alien people present many striking features of contrast which sharply differentiate them from the population of Egypt and Nubia. In height they do not differ in any marked degree, but their cr ania are shorter and considerably broader than those of the indig e nous people. The nose is much narrower, more prominent and high - bridged than that of the Egyptian or Nubian, and in comparison with the latter, the nasal spine is much more prominent. Nobody knows just who these blue - eyed, fair - skinned people were, or even where they came from...Anthropologically, they were termed Caucasians - Gerald O'Farrell ( The T u tankhamun Deception ) These people, Elliot Smith concluded, were more than intelligent enough to accomplish the amazing building feats that the modern world marvels at on the banks of the Nile - ibid"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" Queen Nefertiti - her daughter is buried in Ireland W e believe that the decision to flood the sacred Nubian plains of the Northern Sudan was a cle ver ploy to conceal the burial grounds of the Western peoples who had influenced Egyptian culture. In ancient times Nubia was an independent region considered sacred by the Egy p tians who thought of it as the realm of the gods. The Nile flowed down through the mountains of Nubia and so anyone buried in that area, by request or by tradition, were very esteemed. The Caucasian features described by Sir Elliot Smith are to be seen on the face of Queen Nefertiti, her sister Mutnodjmet (wife of Pharaoh Heremheb), and her daughter Meritaten (Sc o ta). Indeed, there is little doubt in our minds that Nefertiti and her family were of Irish ancestry. This explains why Scota, her eldest daughter, traveled to Ireland by way of Spain after the fall of Akhenaton's corrupt dyn asty and why her grave was found, not in Egypt, but in Ireland's County Kerry.

A. W. Budge ( Egypt in the Neolithic and Archaic Periods ) It is singular to find a white race spoken of in the ancient monuments. Dr. Brugsch, the learned German, notices the word Tam - hou or white men. As it occurs on tablet s dated 2,500 years before Christ, it is puzzling to indicate the people.

This word is Egyptian for sure, and it referred to the most ancient sun god Amen Ra, prim a rily worship ped at Thebes. Interestingly, however, the word Amen (from Ame n tet ) meant \"W estern,\" or \"W estern side.\" It also refers to the \"shadow land\" or \"underworld,\" that is to the realms of the dead. This symbolism arose not only from the fact that the sun pe rceptibly sank into darkness in the W est but from the racial memories of what had occurred in the North - W estern lands that had once been verita b le wastelands of death and decay. So, the very name of the chief solar god of Egypt actually signified the ances tral lands of the W estern hemisphere. The hieroglyphic for Amen was a straight vertical pole (like the capital letter \"I\") to p ped with a small sun disk with rays. This revealing hieroglyphic of Amen was also known as men, meaning \"monument,\" \"mountain,\" o r simply \"block of stone.\" W e suggest that this glyph referred to the ancestral homelands in the W est that housed the great and distinctive megalithic temples of stone that stood vertically in the way described by the Egyptian Amen hieroglyphic.

At St onehenge the sun rises above the famous \"heel\" stone. The word heel comes from hele or helios , meaning sun. The hieroglyphic expressed that Amen, the sun - god, and his priesthood, and worship originated in W estern lands. That these lands were the \"end place ,\" where the sun god rested every evening was the reason why prayers ended with the word Amen, to signify termination. One of the "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"words for prayer was \"orison,\" that clearly resembles \"h o rizon.\" Again, the reference is to both geography and Astro - Theology . That the Amen hieroglyphic should connote the ancient Megalithic sun temples of England and Ireland is not so strange once it is realized that Ston e henge and other important British sites have conclusively been shown to be geometrically and geomanti cally aligned to the great pyramid at Giza. W e surmise that certain prime Megalithic sites of Britain are also aligned with Egyptian temples, and that the secret theosophy of Irish Druidism was central to the theology of the Theban Amenists, as well as to the sun priests of Lower Egypt. The Egyptians simply duplicated the solar symbolism and geometric principles of the W estern Megaliths with their great pyramid. Amen, the sun, rose above their \"mountain\" of stone at Giza in the same way as it did in the ori ginal Western homelands of Amen. The reader who wishes to learn more about the geometric connections between Stonehenge and the great pyramid of Egypt is directed to the works of Gerald S. Ha w kins, Norman Lockyer, John F. Mitchell, and Bonnie Gaunt. Osiris enthroned, and riding through the underworld on his solar boat. Osiris was the god of the earth and of the dead. He represented the natural cycles of birth and death. His \"dismemberment\" recalled the cataclysms and paroxysms that had visited the world and particularly the North - Western Hemisphere. The root of his name, sir , meant the \"West.\" Indeed, one name for Osiris was Wesir , which is remarkably close the present spelling for the word West . It is our belief that the entire cult of Osiris w as transported to Egypt from Britain. Wesir (Osiris) is known to have replaced Khentamentiu whose name meant \"Foremost of the Westerners.\" As Isis (Ast) represented the East, so did her husband (Asir) represent the West. Scholars accept without question th at the Greeks and Romans fused several deities together to form individual members of their own pantheons. Serapis, Dionysus, Mithras, and even Zeus, were composites of archaic Egyptian and Sumerian gods. The Egyptians were not above the same plagiarizatio n. Many of their gods and goddesses were fusions of more ancient figures. This is particularly true of Hathor, Ptah, Osiris, and Horus. Scholars readily accept that the Greeks and Romans borrowed their gods from Egypt. They are, however, not as receptive t o the idea that the Egyptians had done something similar. The Western origins of Egyptian cultural elements is not to be broached or"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"considered. Osiris on his boat gives us the visual impression that this god was indeed from beyond the sea, He frequented t he \"Underworld\" and that was not, as we are meant to believe, merely a conceptual realm. It was a physical region. It was the ancestral lands of the North - West ruined by natural upheaval. It was the land of the setting sun, of darkness and death, into whic h the sun (Osiris) retired (or returned) at day's end. The enemy of Osiris and his son Horus was the serpentine Typhon. This is where we get the word Typhoon . The serpent Typhon, or Apophis, was a figurative analog for the destructive force of nature. Osir is traveled West every night to sacrificially enter into combat with the evil serpent and ensure that such incomprehensible cataclysm should never reoccur. This fact is further reinforced when we remember that the main symbol of Osiris was the Djed Pillar. The fallen column is shown being ritually reset in its vertical position. This rite of lifting the pillar of Osiris into upright position encapsulated the same idea of which we speak. It represented the restoration of order and stability after a time of w orldwide calamity. (See the chapter on Comyns Beaumont for more on this subject). Osiris was associated, and even fused, with the Old Kingdom god Seker (or Sokar). Seker was depicted as a mummified deity, falcon or hawk - headed, and with green skin that rep resented rebirth. Of course, this green coloring parallels the Irish Herne or Cernunnos, god of nature. Seker was often shown hovering on wings above the body of the dece a sed. He was, therefore, the basis of the Christian Holy Spirit. Anubis - one of the oldest gods of Egypt and closely associated with Osiris and Horus. Some traditions have him as the brother of Horus and son of Nephthys the sister of Isis. He was largely based on the most ancient Jackal - headed god known as Khenta - Mentiu, worshipped in Upper Egyptian cities such as Abydos and Saqqara. Suggestively, this name means \"Foremost of the Westerners.\" Mentiu or Mentu was a hawk - headed god thought to have been the early precusor of Horus. His title was the \"Nomad,\" which implies a distant god of foreign origin. We conclude that m a ny of Egypt's predynastic gods had Western origins. Egyptians understood this Anubis as lord of the Western lands and hemisphere. This also meant he was the ruler of the dead. Egyptians associated the Underworld with the lands beyond the Western horizon (\"Zone of Horus\"), not only because the sun set there but because of the terrible ruin that had been suffered by the lands of the North - West. Those who still find it impossible, or far - fetched, to suppose that Egyptian rel i gion and culture was influenced by foreigners from W estern lands should bear in mind that historians have already accepted that W estern Indo - Europeans (or Aryans) contributed cultural elements to Northern India. They should bear in mind that the Mosle ms of Persia and Yemen brought to India highly sophi s ticated cultural elements as they established their Mughal dynasty, and that Buddhism, born in India, moved Eastward to dramatically influence and enrich Chinese culture. They had best remember the fact that during the early cent u ries of the Christian era, up until the Middle Ages, Culdean monks traveled throughout Europe from Ireland in their capacity as educators of nobility. Yes, Marco Polo could travel to China, as all agree he did. Abaris could make his way from Ireland to the Athenian school of Pythagoras, and Apollonius of Ty a na could travel to India to locate the schools and ashrams of the Brahmins, and the ancient Irish \"Scots\" could travel Eastward and settle in Scotland g i ving that country its d istinctive name.

It has taken centuries for academia to begrudgingly entertain even this simple provable idea although, ultimately, it is still tantamount to academic heresy to pronounce Egypt to be the cradle of civilization and the originator of Christian theology. Nonetheless, academics will sooner muse over and ratify commerce from East to West than it will endorse traversal from West to East . Indeed, this rarer kind of speculation, asserted first by Comyns Beaumont, Anna W ilkes, and Conor Mac Dari, is quite taboo. R e gardless, the reason why pharaohs and pharaohs' daughters are found interned in the far off land of Ireland is because Ireland was an ancestral homeland to which they were returning . It was from there that their forefathers had come bearing the knowledge that enabled Egypt's fine civilization to form and which initiated the construction of the Great Pyramid and Sphinx. No other agency, not even an Egyptian one, can rationally claim responsibility for their construction. These great edifices stand unclaimed.

The word Assyria contains the syllable syr that, like sir or seir , connotes the W est. Moreover, the Assyrian language was undoub tedly not Semitic. It dates from a very early period. In 1887, one of the greatest scholars on the subject of Babylonian civilization, Professor A. H.

The Akkadian empire had been at its height 2,000 years BC. However, the term Akkad derives from a Sumerian word, agade , meaning \"fire crown\" or \"me n crowned with fire.\" It may also be related to an ideograph for \"mound,\" after the fact that the central temple stood upon a high place or mound.

The corruption of the text has been further increased by the imperfect acquainta n ce of many of the later editors with the pre - Semitic dialects of Chaldea.

The lang u age of the Phoenicians was not, as most scholars are wont to believe and a d vocate, a dialect of Egyptian. On the contrary, the Egyptian language was d e rived from Phoenician. Phoenicia led the way to a wider literacy through the development of the alphabet - Thomas L. Thompson ( The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) ...the alphabet that the early Israelites used was and is demonstra bly based on the Ph o enician's script - Ralph Ellis ( Scota: Egyptian Queen of the Scots ) ...this new Phoenician script became the basis for the later Hebrew, Greek and Latin scripts, and so this aspect of Phoenician culture has become a central component of all Western cultures - ibid One of the main reasons why ancient Israel has disappeared from the stage of history is that Israel did not speak Hebrew but Phoenician - Fredrick Haberman ( Tracing Our A n cestors ) The Phoenician legends show that Misor, from wh om the Egyptians were descended, was the child of the Phœnician gods Amynus and Magus. Misor gave birth to Taaut, the god of letters, the inventor of the alphabet, and Taaut became Thoth, the god of history of the Egyptians. Sanchoniathon tells us that \"Ch ronos (king of Atlantis) visited the South, and gave all Egypt to the god Taaut, that it might be his kingdom.\" \"Misor\" is probably the king \"Mestor\" named by Plato - Ignatius Donnelly ( Atlantis: the Antediluvian World , 1882) A n objective study of the evid ence shows that Aramaic, Hebrew, Arabic, S y riac, and Armenian, as well as many other ancient languages, were enriched by the infusion of Phoenician religious and cultural elements."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"We have found in the most ancient records of the Aryan language proof that the indic a tions of religious thought are higher, simpler and purer as we go back in time - The D u ke of Argyll ( Unity of Nature ) The names of the patriarchal heroes, as that of God Himself, are non - Semitic...and go back to the earliest known civilizations i n the near East, indeed of the world - John Alle g ro ( The Chosen People ) ...all the languages of the western world were the same, and that one system of letters, that of ancient Irish Druids, pervaded the whole - and was common to the British Isles, and Gau l, to the inhabitants of Italy, Greece, Syria, Arabia, Persia, and Hindoostan - Godfrey Higgins ( Celtic Druids ) When the ten tribes of Israel were taken into Assyrian captivity, they took their langu a ge with them, and the only inscription that they left in Palestine is the Siloam inscri p tion in Jerusalem, and it is not in Hebrew but in Phoenician...When the kingdom of J u dah went into Babylon captivity about 600 BC, and only 42,000 of them came back s e venty years later, they adopted the Aramaic: and the gene ration that came back had forgotten their fathers' language to the extent that Ezra had to translate the Law for them - Fredrick Haberman ...the ancient Hebrews had the same tongue and letters or characters with the Canaan i tes or Phoenicians, as might be e videnced from the concurrent testimonies of many authors; nay, all the nations in these parts, Phoenicians, Canaanites, Samaritans, and probably the Assyrians, for some years spoke and wrote alike - Godfrey Higgins As our scholars have failed to see the di fference between Israel and the Jews, they h a ve completely confused the issue; and when they speak of ancient Hebrew they mean Phoenician. \"The oldest Hebrew manuscript dates from AD 489, is a roll and was found in the Karaite Synagogue in the Crimea.\" The Targum version of the Old Testament d o es not date any earlier than the Babylonian captivity of the Jews, and it was written in the Aramaic Chaldee language, and even of that version there is no BC in existence. So when our scholars speak of the ancient He brew of the Israelites they mean Phoenician evidently, for they never have seen it written on a scroll, only on the Siloam inscription, the Moabite stone, and the Phoenician engravings of the East, the Mediterranean, Southern Russia, and Europe, particular ly in Britain - Fredrick Haberman ( Tracing our Ance s tors ) Neither the Phoenician nor the Aramaic possessed any vowels, therefore the pronu n ciations differed according to locality and age.

The facts concerning the distortion of truth concerning Phoenician language and culture has been fully explained by Professor L. A. W addell. Professor W addell was one of the first men to accurately translate many seals and s cripts of the ancient world, particularly those of the Phoenicians, Babylonians, and Sumerians (\"Sum Aryans\"). His exemplary and incontestable discoveries have been deliberately suppressed by those obscurantists whose p a trons have a great deal to lose shou ld the facts concerning our world's true history ever be widely known. This book is also offered as a pioneer contribution towards a true Universal History of Man from the earliest civilized period founded on concrete Facts, as contrasted with current do gmatic Theories appealing to tradition and prejudice, and often it is to be feared designed in the interest of those who profit by the maintenance of Error - Profe s sor L. A. Waddell (Preface: The Makers of Civilization ) Unlike Professor W addell, we do not believe the Phoenicians were originally an Eastern European people who took their cultural elements W estward to Britain during their various prolonged trading and mining missions. The new evidence slowly coming to light, regarding pre - diluvian civilization s in the W est, and concerning lost land bridges, strengthens our strong belief in the W estern origins of the Phoenician people. From the British Isles, these ma s ters of the high seas, who were also known as the Arcadians or \"Bear Race,\" traveled to the Ame ricas taking with them, as the great researcher Barry Fell proved, their Gaelic tongue that is still spoken by the Algonquin Indians of Canada and North America. And from their homeland, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, they also traveled Eastward, taking t heir cultural idioms to those oriental lands. There were few places on the face of the Earth where Phoen i cian ships had not docked. The fact is that Ireland was the first power that colonized along both sides of the Med i terranean sea and, therefore, the co lonies came from the West instead of from the East as our astute Roman and British historians would have us believe. And the world has believed it up to now...Investigators have followed the fast clue sent out from this sou r ce and found nothing in the East to support this claim that the Aryans emigrated from the East and colonized toward the West. The real and true evidence points just in the opposite direction - Conor MacDari"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"In our estimation there can be little doubt that the Phoenicians originated in Br itain. W e wholeheartedly agree with Professor W addell who first declared, in the 1920s, that the Phoenicians were definitely related tribally and ethnically to the Sumerians, Amorites, Hittites, and perhaps the Minoans of Crete. Since, as Ralph Ellis has s hown, the Minoans of Crete were closely connected to the Hyksos pharaohs of Egypt, it is logical to assume the Phoenicians, Minoans, and Hyksos were associated in some way, culturally, racially, or more likely, economically. In any case, there can be littl e doubt, given the philological ev i dence, that the Phoenicians and Sumerians were one and the same people. However, unlike Professor W addell, we do not believe the original homeland of the Phoenicians and Sumerians to have been either Cappadocia in modern Turkey, or the Danube Valley. W e believe it to have been Britain. It is, ther e fore, through the travels of the Phoenicians that the world's parent language dispersed. Additionally, from the Phoenicians came the first unadulterated stellar and solar religio n and first organized pantheons, as well as other tec h niques of science, architecture, music, and art. According to the traditions of the Phoenicians, the Gardens of the Hesperides were in the remote west - (Murray's Manual of Mythology ) ...the Phoenician s were unquestionably identified with Atlantis, and that it was probably from Atlantis they derived their god Baal, or Bel, or El, whose name crops out in the Bel of the Babylonians, the Elohim, and the Beelzebub of the Jews, and the Allah of the Arabians, And we find that this great deity, whose worship extended so widely among the Mediterranean races, was known and adored also upon the northern and western coasts of Europe. Professor Nilsson finds traces of Baal worship in Scandinavia; he tells us that th e festival of Baal, or Balder, was celebrated on midsummer's night in Scania, and far up into Norway, almost to the Loffoden Islands, until within the last fifty years. The feast of Baal, or Beltinne, was celebrated in Ireland to a late period. I argue fro m these facts, not that the worship of Baal came to Ireland and Norway from Assyria or Arabia, but that the same great parent - race which carried the knowledge of Baal to the Mediterranean brought it also to the western coasts of Europe, and with the ador a t ion of Baal they imported also the implements of bronze now found in such abundance in those regions - Ignatius Donnelly ( Atlantis: the Antediluvian World , 1882) Although Mediterranean and Asian cultures went on to develop, refine, and also distort the cul tural elements they inherited from the W estern Elders, they were not the original manufacturers of them. The seeds of Eastern European and Asian civilization were transmitted not from Scythia, as most \"Celtic\" sch o lars concede, but from much farther W est, from the greatly endowed \"Atlant e an\" inhabitants of the \"Furthest W est Sunset Land,\" who fashioned by their art the colossal W estern temples still to be seen at Stonehenge, Newgrange, Ca r rowkeel, Avebury, and Carnac.

The original theology and ritual of the megalithic priesthood demanded that there were no idols, no imagery and no ins cri p tions, as the design of these monuments was not supposed to give away the identity of the architects or builders - Ralph Ellis ( Eden in Egypt ) Though Stonehenge be the proudest singularity of this sort, in the world, as far as we know: yet there are so many others, manifestly formed upon the same, or kindred d e sign, by the same measure, and for the same purpose, all over the Britannic isles; that we can have no room to doubt of their being made by the same people, and that by d i rection of the British Dr uids.

The Greeks mention the \"Hyperborean Race\" of the North - Western hemisphere, and that they possessed a circular temple. There can be little doubt as to the identity of these Hyperboreans.

This is no other than the house of God, this is the gate of heaven - (Genesis 28: 16 - 17) In light of this, we do not accept as accurate the official dates given for the rise of the Phoenicians (a few hundred years BC). Adonis - also known as Adon, a name that meant \"Lord.\" He was the supreme god of the Phoenicians. There are many similarities between Adonis, Attis, Os i ris, Tammuz, and Balder. The Norse Balder was probably the prototype for Adonis. After his death, Adonis' soul was claimed by Persephone, goddess of the Underworld W e agree with Comyns Beaumont and L. A. W addell that their ancestry went much further back in time. W hat we do know is that the term Phoenician is thought to have derived from one of three main sources. The word referred to the purple dye extracted from shellfish by the Phoenicians who held the monopoly on its production. This dye was preferred by the pharaohs of Egypt and was primaril y a color of royalty. Then, we find the word connected to the mythical bird known as the phoenix, and to the sacred tree of this strange creature, namely the date palm. The image of the date palm frond, that turns up in the story of Jesus, was commonly to be found above the doorways and windows of temples, shrines, and sacred colleges. Cities such as Tanis, which author Ralph Ellis believes was the actual site of the biblical Jerusalem, were richly adorned with majestic palm columns and decorative stone pal m frond motifs. Amid the frond motif was usually the solar disk since the palm frond and tree were sacred to the sun god Amun Ra. W e believe that the Cult of Amun Ra had its origins in Ireland. The Phoenicians, therefore, had a strong connection to one of the most ancient and important gods of the sun. The Phoenix symbolized sp i ritual resurrection and also zodiacal cycles.

Officially, they are known to have frequently traveled to Br i tain where they mined for ores such as copper and tin.

Furthermore, the stars of Ursa Minor were those principally used in all navigation by land as well as by sea, to direct the course of the trav e ler. Thus the Arcadian or Bear Race were known as the guides or pathfinders of mankind, leading and lighting t he way like Mercury or Hermes...The Phoenicians were r e nowned sailors and navigators, as well as teachers and healers - Peter Dawkins ( Arcadia ) In primitive centuries, when ancient maritime races thus held supremacy in the Medite r ranean Sea, voyages were undoubtedly made far into the Atlantic Ocean. The Phoen i cians, who of all the nations settled on its shores lay among the remotest from the outlying ocean, habitually traded with settlements on the Atlantic. They colonized the western shores of the Mediter ranean at a remote period; occupied numerous favorable tr a ding posts on the bays and headlands of the Euxine, as well as of Sicily and others of the larger islands; passing beyond the straits, effected settlements along the coasts of Europe and Africa. Acc ording to Strabo, they had factories beyond the Pillars of Herc u les in the period immediately succeeding the Trojan War: an era which yearly becomes for us less mythical, and to which may be assigned the great development of the co m mercial prosperity of Ty re - Sir Daniel Wilson ( The Lost Atlantis and other Ethnographic Studies, 1892) Solomon had good reason for assuring himself of active Phoenician support...no one disputes that the Phoenicians were masters at that time of both the Mediterranean and seas fu rther to the east.

Chara c teristically, the Phoenicians had no land on which they settled, but rather a network of s hipping facilities and numerous far - flung outposts at places across the known world - Gruber and Kersten ( The Original Jesus ) W e concur with Professor W addell's conjecture that the Phoenicians were not members of the Semitic racial family. The archaeologic al evidence clearly shows that they were, like the Irish, ethnically and racially Gothic, Nordic, Indo - European, and Caucasian or, as Professor W addell preferred, \"Aryan.\" Thus the daring Phoenician pioneer mariners...and of whose great contributions to th e civilization of Greece and Rome classic writers speak in glowing terms, were, I found by indisputable inscriptional and other evidence, not Semites as hitherto supposed, but were Aryans in Race, Speech and Script - ( Egyptian Civilization: Its Sumerian Or igins and True Chronology )"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The original Irish, who had survived immense cataclysms, knew they needed access to the rest of the world in order to survive. They knew this meant the development of a \"navy.\" So, the navigators were created. They were the Phoen icians, the expert observers of the heavens and mappers of the world. Their sidereal knowledge was an extension of Druidic wisdom perfected over centuries in North - W estern lands. This knowledge allowed the \"Hyperborean\" Phoenicians to expertly navigate the oceans of the world. Like later Vikings and Danes, the Phoenicians sailed to the East (and W est) creating small se t tlements on the coasts of lands they visited, traded with, and mined. Because of their prolonged commercial interaction with Asians and Orie ntals, the Pho e nicians' alphabet, as well as many other Phoenician customs and practices, were adopted. Eventually, at the time of the Roman expansion, and after their roving decreased, the Phoenicians co - meddled with races of foreign blood and slowly bega n to lose their own racial distinctiveness. One of the terms that the Phoenicians used to describe themselves was Bh a rat , Barata , or Parats . This was the name of one of their earliest kings, the Sumerian Brihat, or Bharat. W e surmise that this king, like his seafaring people, were actually named after the land of their ancestors, namely Barata, Brita, or Britain. From their name we also derive the Indo - Aryan tribe known as the Bharats who frequented the Indus Valley. W e do not think that Britain received i ts name from the Phoenicians after they traveled there from the East. One of the most important Phoenician goddesses was known as Brit Ana meaning \"Lady of the W aters.\" She is clearly depicted on Carthaginian (Phoenician) coins often holding a ship's rudde r or sitting near the ocean. An early Phoenician and Sumerian sun god was known as Dar or Der, which is a name similar to Djer, the third king of Egypt's first dynasty. Dar (or Daru, Dur, Der, and Derry, etc) was the prototype for the Germanic god Thor and for the heroic semi - mythical British King Arthur. The term Dar is, however, close to the root for the word \"Druid.\" The syllable turns up in the name of the Persian King Darius and can ce r tainly be ascribed to the oak trees that were sacred to The British Isles - named after Baratana, or Britana, the goddess of the Barats or Bharats (Phoenicians). They were re ferred to as \"Aryans.\" The term Bharata is possibly a corruption of Bhara, or even of Dhara: Dhar meaning \"druid\" and ara meanings \"Arya\" officially, the Bharats were worshippers of Agni, the god of fire.

This was a great capital of learning where people from all over the world gathered to pursue arts, education, and trade. It was a city built and dominated by an Irish race known as the Phoenicians. It was known in Arabic as Gubayl, Gebal, or Jubel (note the Gaelic bal and bel roots). Along with the Phoenician city of Sidon, Byblos is considered the oldest city in the world, certainly the oldest in the East. Thr ough the city's waterways passed ships carrying the papyrus used to make books. The word book comes from buka, which was the Egyptian word for the papyrus reed. Tradition had it that the city was founded by Thoth, the god of writing and sacred knowledge. T he god Cronus (from the Irish Crom) was also a chief tutelary deity of the city. The incredible antiquity and sophistication of this city and region was confirmed when Egyptian artifacts were discovered dating back before the fourth pharaonic dynasty, over 2,500 years BC.

W hat has not been officially conceded is the Irish origins of these \"Phoenicians.\" Their settlements and great cities (Carthage, Tyre, Byblos, Sidon, Pelusium, Arvad, etc) have been located in the Middle East but they were not their or iginal homelands. When we read in our popular histories of Phoenicia, we must never consider it as a n a tional unity, like Egypt, Babylon, or Rome; for Phoenicia in this respect was different from any other country in history. Phoenicia never at any time wa s a nation under one government, but was merely a geographical designation - Fredrick Haberman ( Tracing Our Ancestors ) W e find, upon research into this extraordinary race, that there has been relu c tance among historians to properly place the Phoenicians. T o do so would inevitably not only shatter the myth of world history accepted by the masses but would ultimately confirm theories concerning the Irish origins of civilization. Only alternative historians Ignatius Donnelly and Comyns Beaumont accepted the tr uth of the matter and accurately set the homeland of the Phoenician race in Ireland and Scotland. According to Beaumont, the Phoenicians' main base of operation may have been ancient Moravia. The word Moravia contains the root Mor which, like Mer, denotes the ocean. It is a root that turns up in the name Fomorian and Amorite . In Egyptian this syllable Mer signified the pyr a mid and the keepers of arcane secrets. Moravia was an area stretching from Caithness (in the extreme North - W est of Scotland) southward a long the River Tay to Inverness, and even further South to Perth. It may be that the Phoen i cians were not unrelated to the ancient Calendonii, from whom the Highland Picts are descended. These Picts have mythologies and histories concerning massive global cataclysm and the ruination of their original paradisiacal hom e lands in the North. Their lore speaks of the wars of the gods, the violence in the heavens that wrecked the planet, and the subsequent dispersion of the races. The Romans saw to it that the Pic ts were routed and marginalized. They have been largely ignored and conveniently labeled primitive and barb a ric. Comyns Beaumont specifically draws our attention to the extremely int e resting and suggestive fact that the first Christian churches were establ ished in the Highlands of Scotland, specifically at Iona and Mull. The suppression of local lore and religion by the monks from these early churches is a matter of historical record.

Under no circumstances was this knowledge to become widely known. So the disi n formation began to flow forth concerning this special and enlightened race. Almost everything we read about them is designed to deceive. ...it a ppears to be the Land of Kham or Ham, the oldest traditional name for Egypt, and a usual name for that land and its people in the Hebrew Old Testament, where the Pho e nicians are called \"Sons of Ham\" - L.

This term is Cabiri or Kabiri . Duplicitous scholars and propagandists would have it known that this word means \"Easterner,\" in Hebrew. However, we think it is more likely that the term simply meant those Phoenicians living in the East and not Phoenicians of the East. There is all the difference in the world between the two implications and we are convinced, from the evide n ce and omissions, that the former is the true reading. The term Kabiri (or Cabiri ) turns up in Strabo who said that this was the name for the Phoenician elite, the masters of healing, building, navigation, and mining, etc. Grecian rendering of Mercury, the Irish Herne, Ogmios or Cernunnos, guide of the d e ad, healer and herald. Mercury as Egyptian Thoth. Dogs head (cur) and Serpent Wand, and Ankh. The Caduceus of Hermes was also known as the Kerykeion , it was the magic wand of power.

The root Mer referred to the pyramid in Egypt and to its mysteries. it also meant the \"high ones\" The Cabiri were the great diviners and soothsayers. The Greek historian H e rodotus called them the Curetes , from which we get the French cure (priest) and English cure (to heal). W e find the syl lable cur in the word Mercury , a god beloved of the Phoenicians. Mercury, whose name comes from the Egyptian Maa Kheru, meaning \"True W ords,\" was a most versatile god. He was the only one who could pass into either Olympus or Hades. Mercury holds the serpe n tine caduceus that signifies occult knowledge and mastery. W e believe"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"this symbol to be the standard not just of modern \"medics\" but of the Irish - Phoenician Cabiri , the stargazing hierophants of old. The term appears again around the ancient Egyptian god of metallurgy Ptah. Ptah was a creator god primarily worshipped at Memphis. In the bible this gr e at and ancient city was called Noph, which probably derives from nef meaning \"serpent.\" The word Ptah means \"father\" and we derive the diminutive Pa from it. Ptah's Kabeiroi were his team of helpers assisting in the fashioning of Cre a tion. Mercury was, however, based on much older Irish gods. Commerce, much developed among the settled Gauls, gave rise to a god or gods who guarded roads over which merchants trav eled, and boundaries where their transactions took place. Hence we have an inscription from Yorkshire, \"To the god who invented roads and paths,\" while another local god of roads, equated with Mercury, was Cimi a cinus - J. A. MacCulloch ( The Religion of the Ancient Celts ) The Irish had traveled to every known country in ancient times. They bore the name Fenian or Fenician (from Fenii or Phenii ) that later became transposed to Phoenician. The term may be connected to the planet and stellar archetype Venus (fo und as a root in veneration and also in places such as Venice and Vienna ). The ancient navigators used this star when traveling, and the prows of their ships bore the female goddess form. Ships become known as \"She\" and were considered sacred to the goddes s. The consensus of most official Irish historians concerning the term Fenician, is that it comes from the \"Fenian Cycle\" of Irish history, after the tribe of the giant king Fionn mac Cumhaill (pr. \"Finn mac Cool\"). The fact that Fionn was a giant is crypt ically revealing. It refers to the pre - diluvian \"giants,\" or wise ones from lost civilizations of prehist o ry. It also connoted the builders of great earthworks and astronomically ali g ned monuments. Fionn was especially connected with the geological marvel known as \"The Giant's Causeway\" in Northern Ireland. He was a descendant of the Tuatha de Danann, the Megalithic magi of Ireland who ruled millennia earlier and who were connected with the Faerie (or \"Luminous Ones\"). As the great Irish legends of the Sons of Tureinn and of Bran reveal, the Irish - Phoenicians were master navigators and sailors. The Fenicians were none other than the Phoenicians . The capital of the kings of Ireland was at Tara (a name meaning gateway or portal in both Hebrew and Egyptian), th e capital of the Cappadocian Hittites (W hite Syrians) was at Pteira, the Lebanese capital city of the Phoenicians was Tyre.

As the pages of ancient history reveal, the mighty Thales (the so - called \"father of science\") was a Ph oenician. Zeno Apathea (the father of Stoicism, one of the purest and most elevated philosophies) was born to Phoenicians. The sublime Virgil (the great poet of Rome) was also of Irish extraction. He lived in a \"Celtic\" city of C i salpine Gaul. Greatest of all, Dante (the father of the Renaissance) although possibly not himself of Irish stock (little is known of his ancestry) was, from his youth, a devout acolyte of the Provencal poets and troubadours; the \"Provencal\" being a \"Celtic\" bastion in Languedoc in France. Sadly, however, there are probably more lies written about the Phoenicians than about any other people, with the exception of the Irish. In fact, the Phoenicians are the Irish. Known for their expertise with navigation, trading, and with building great structures, they were virtually the royal astronomers of the world and had visited almost every corner of the globe in their fine vessels. One of the main reasons why we find so many s i milar cultural idioms the world over has to do with the visitati ons of the Phoenician - Irish. W hen King Solomon desired to build the great Temple of Jerusalem he promptly called on Hiram Abiff, the Phoenician master architect to do the job for him. Since the Phoenicians had already given Egypt the skills to build the py ramids, a temple was no problem. Solomon knew who to call upon and it was not upon his ―Jews.‖ The temple (that author Ralph Ellis believes was actually in the city of Tanis on the W estern side of the Delta) was designed with sacred geometry and was a repr esentation of man and not god. It was based on the proportions of the human temple. The architectural marvels to be found at Galicia, Ortigueira, Patara, Carthage, and Petra, etc, are most likely the result of Phoenician ingenuity. Jewish historians fr eely admit that their supposed King Solomon had to bring in \"Phoenician\" builder Hiram Abiff to construct his sacred Temple. Its design was based on the real sanctum sanctorum , or \"Holy of Holies\" - the human body. The name Hiram Abiff means \"noble father\" or \"highborn.\" (Image used with permission from Tony Badillo ). The temple was not physical. It was symbolic, and both the night sky and the h u man body, ( here for more info ) That the Phoenicians were of Irish extraction is shown by the name of their second most important city, Tyre.

It is now known that pyramidical structu res existed at the Ne w grange site. These buildings were deliberately removed. The one answer that solves the problem is the one answer few dare accept.

Mystery solved! In Smith's Dict ionary of the Bible, the religion of the Phoenicians is described in the way Morien has done that of the Druids; - \"a personification of the forces of nature, which, in its more philosophical shadowing forth of the Supreme powers, may be said to have repres ented the male and female principles of production\" - James Bonwick Although Palestine continued throughout the Bronze Age as an illiterate backwater, this was not true of Phoenicia. Its towns resembled the great cities of Syria. A literate arti s tic cultur e of considerable merit developed at Ugarit in the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries, and scribes communicated regularly between the major towns of Palestine, from Bythos, Shechem and Jerusalem and the Egyptian court. Writing had long been established in Syria, at the market town of Ebla, from as early as the twenty - fourth century BC, and a few examples of literary texts have been found from Alalakh and Megi d do - Thomas L. Thompson ( The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) These revel ations forced duplicitous historians, such as Flinders Petrie and Frederick Haberman, to re - examine the role of the Phoenicians and to begrudgingly accept that it was they, and not the Israelites, who were the cre a tors of the alphabet, the great temple bui lders, and the world's finest seafarers, astronomers, and adepts. W hat they still hesitate to accept is the Irish origins of the Phoenicians. This fact has been obscured due to the geographical di s persion of the Phoenicians. As we have said, this dispersio n was a necessity after the Age of Catastrophe. Unfortunately, by spreading themselves thinly across the world, and by assimilating with nations that far outnumbered them, the Phoenicians and their kindred groups would eventually disappear as di s tinct enti ties.

American Arya The wisdom of old, the myths, parables, and dark sayings that were preserved, have been presented to us dreadfully deformed in the course of being converted into history - Albert Churchward ( The O rigin and Evolution of Religion ) Today, we find many red herrings being widely advertised, such as the \"Bloo d line of Jesus\" and the \"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\" sagas, most of which, although they appear controversial, actually offer little opposition to the p owers that be. Despite the proliferation of books on these subjects (and the television pr o grams they frequently spawn), the so - called \"Holy Grail\" still remains the enigma it was in the beginning, the \"Ark of the Covenant\" is still not found, and the Holy Roman Church is still going strong, building its altars with the bones of its victims. W e rarely hear from such authors that the first mention of a sacred chalice or \"Grail\" comes from Ireland. The great cauldron of life, the prototype of the Grail, was known in Ireland thousands of years before Christian mythogra p hers utilized it. It was used as a symbol in Christianity because Christianity i t self is based on Druidism. W e can take the accounts as true, since it is unlik e ly that monkish scribes would have interpolated stories of such \"pagan\" treas u res off their own bat, any more than they would have invented Lugh, the sun god before their Christ. The prototypical cauldron of life was one of four supe r nal symbols of Druidism.

It was the symbol of water and of the many lakes of Ireland referred to as \"Cup Bearers.\" The four suits of t he traditional 52 playing card pack. The Egyptians knew of the cards as did several other cult u res. However, their true origins are Irish. Lakes were considered sacred since they provided pure water to survivors after the cataclysm that changed the face of the continents. The cups and chalices used in Druidic rituals were types based on the original great cauldron. The Druidic \"Eucharist\" would occur when a diviner would present a water - filled chalice to symbolically capture the reflection of the moon as it passed overhead at night. At the point when the moon's image fell across the water, a libation of the moon - infused water would be offered to the initiates or participants in the ritual. Sunlight would also be captured in this way. W hen its light filled the water, the drinkers would imbibe. The white wafer used by later Christian priests originated from this Druidic ritual. In the great cairn at Newgrange in Ireland a large stone cauldron was found. Obviously, this was filled with water and used for clean sing and initiatory ritual. The light of the sun and the moon enter into this cairn and fill its inner chamber, in which the cauldron sits, on the three days of the winter solstice. Three is one of the most important numbers in Druidism, which is why it is found throughout Christian and Freemas o nic iconography. The Freemasonic Orders preserve the original Druidic teachings, using them for their own private uplift and empowerment. ...the Graal of Arthurian romance has affinities with the Celtic cauldron. In the Conte du Graal of pseudo - Chrétien, a cup comes in of itself and serves all present with food. This is a simple conception of the Graal, but in other poems its magical and sacrosanct ch a racter is heightened. It supplies the food which the eater prefers , it gives immortal youth and immunity from wounds. In these respects it presents an unmistakable lik e ness to the cauldron of Celtic myth. But, again, it was the vessel in which Christ had instituted the Blessed Sacrament; it contained His Blood; and it ha d been given by our Lord to Joseph of Arimathea.

Indeed, the doctrine of Transubstantiation is one of the most ancient of doctrines.

They knew, all too well, that America had already been colonized by Irish mariners and that the far away country co ntained Irish stellar temples and megalithic sites filled with treasure. They had their minds set on pillaging this wealth, and making sure that the relics of Ireland's presence in the New W orld would be attributed to, and regarded as, yet another \"unsolva ble mystery.\" Nowadays, however, when the underground chambers of places such as Ohio's \"Serpent Mound\" are excavated, all manner of Irish artifacts are brought out. The American aboriginals, of both the South and the North, were eager and thrilled at firs t to receive the visitors.

In the state of Ohio there are over 5,000 such mounds while in Michigan and W isconsin there are in e x ce ss of 10,000 sites. None of these sites are of Native Indian origin and, as such, little academic regard has been paid to them. The native Indians of America admit that in all cases except two, the races understood a common language they call Algonquin.

One of the chambers at the complex had been dedicated to the god. The dedication read: To Baal of the Canaanites (Phoenicians), this in dedication .

They were the astrol o gers of Ireland and Egypt. The term Judah in the bible (the fourth son of Jacob whose name was adapted as Jew ) was not a name at all, but a title . It has b e en the clever ploy of duplicitous historians to have us erroneously"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"believe that titles (for an initiate, king, or vizier, etc,) were personal names. This is the case with \"Moses,\" \"Joshua,\" \"Jes us,\" \"Aaron,\" and \"John.\" Judah was the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, son of Abraham. Abraham's original name was Abram until, as chapter 17 of the Book of Genesis tells us, he was given his new title by the Lord. Sarah's original name was Sarai, and Jac ob was renamed ( re - titled ) Israel. He probably received this title because, like his Levite family, he was very closely allied with the Cult of Aton. Being an initiate of the solar co l leges he was eventually given a Druidic title to distinguish him as a \"s hining one.\" As we have shown above, innumerable symbols, icons, and idioms used by \"Jews\" come from the Druidic archive. The term \"Jews\" is never in the Bible applied to the Twelve Tribes or to the Ten - tribed House of Israel - ( The Ensign Trust ) The yew tree was considered very sacred to both Druids and Egyptian Magi. The Ibaru (or Ibri, Abri, or Abari) turn up in Egypt as the \"W ise Ones\" or \"E l ders.\" The letter \"H,\" added as a pre fix, simply meant \"the,\" and so the word Hebrew meant \"the Ebru\" or \"the Ibaru.\" This is the origin of the word Iberia that signified Spain, and Hibernia that signified Ireland. The word rabbi is a rendition or variant of this ancient name Abari or Ibaru . The Ibaru were Druidic Elders who had traveled to Egypt in remote periods bringing solar worship th e re. They were probably akin to the Shemsu Hor , the Disciples or Companions of Horus, the fair - complexioned technically endowed race whose remains w e re found in Nubia by eminent archaeologist Professor W alter B. Emery. This word Ibaru had a similarity to Apiru (Egyptian Apir ) that meant \"wanderer,\" \"undesirable\" \"shepherd,\" or \"foreigner.\" This unfortunate similarity of etymol o gy has caused great confusion but has favored the machinations of those who crave to obscure the truth of the Ibaru's Western ancestry. The vast majority of Jews in the world (approximately 80 percent) have no ethnic or racial ties to the holy land of old. The Ashkenaz Jews originated fro m a race in Southern Russia known as the Khazars. The Khazars lived near the Caspian Sea and were of Turko - Mongolic racial stock. They had close ties with the Hungarian Magyars and Bulgarian Bulgars. They were more akin to the Huns and Tartars than to the \"Hebrews\" of Judea. These ferocious pagan Khazars converted en masse to Judaism during the 7th century. W e understand that any human being can convert to any religion that suits them. This was the case with the Khazarian king of the time. He became Jewish after religious conversion. As centuries pass, the descendants of the converts naturally believed themselves related to the old world \"Israelites.\" They are quite willing to accept the official reports concerning the nature of these people they falsely con sider ancestors. It does not occur to them to question it, or to discover that the Israelites were actually pharaohs. They conceive of themselves as \"Jewish\" with little idea what a Jew was.

To the religious mind, facts do not matter. History be damned. In light of this, we are sure to ask why there are similarities between the old languages. The reason does not have t o do with what we have been told by linguists and anthropologists who are, for the most part, in business to lead us away from the complete truth. They falsely believe and teach that it was racial intermingling through time that allowed languages to meld a nd bear similar i ties. Although the phenomenon can occur, it is not the truth. Languages are not plants that cross - pollinate so fervently. Mingling of this kind, among most ancient tribes and races, was not as common as we would like to believe. A n cient peo ples tended to stay put and be suspicious of foreigners. This is what is meant by \"tribal\" life. It implies segregation and xenophobia. The reason why the languages bear uncanny resemblances has to do with the existence of a great parent language, a root l anguage that was sacrosanct and which was rooted in the gnosis of the heavens. It is known that the world's major civ i lizations had their literate priestly class that employed a hieratic or sacred script. This archetypal parent language, imbued with superl ative vibrational and descriptive qualities, certainly existed. It was taught by the magi in their great mystery schools. It was this magical language that gave rise to many others throughout the planet, not through cross - fertilization but through emul a tio n . Just as we wish to emulate a personal icon or hero, and be \"like them,\" so cultures knew to absorb elements from the meta - language of the Elders they revered. ...the languages of the northern tribes were so near, that they could all understand one anoth er, and that, as might be expected, their laws were all the same - Sir William Temple Let us remember Genesis Chapter 11: The whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

If it was the parent language we can be sure that the rabbis and clergymen would proclaim this fact loudly and clearly ad infinitum . The closest approximations to this original language are Gaelic, Arabic, and Sa nskrit, but others such as Aramaic and Hebrew are near relatives. Tri in Welsh, as in Sanskrit, stands for three.

This \"evil\" was the consequence of the intrigues of those Easter n invaders who bellig e rently conquered the land of Ireland, taking it as a replacement for their lost Egyptian thrones. There is no doubt in our minds, given the accounts, that Ith, Ir, Mile, Donn, and Heber, namely the \"Milesians,\" were blood - related to t he Egyptian Cult of Aton. It is these demagogues who sought to raise their own thrones upon those of the Druids, in a mineral wealthy, strategically well - placed, climatically temperate island known to them from their own childhoods as the \"Fortunate Lands\" in the W est, beyond the \"Pillars of the Giants\" (The Giant's Causeway, County Antrim, Northern Ireland). The story of the Milesians begins with Ith, the son of a great Spanish king ca l led Breogan. This Breogan was a descendant of a king of Scythia by the name of Fenius Farsa whose son Niul (or Nel, or Ne) had lived as a favored guest of the Egyptian pharaohs (most likely those of Lower Egypt). According to the legends pertaining to his family, Niul was given lands and privileges by the Egyptians because hi s father, one Fenius Farsa, was the founder of, and t e acher at, one of the greatest colleges in the world."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" The Land of Scythia, from which the Milesian branch of \"Celts\" arose to conquer Spain and Ireland. The word Saca or Saka , meaning the Scythians, is the root of the word Saxon. Saqqara in Egypt may be named after them. Many solar temples were constructed at Saqqara. We believe teh Celts of Scythia to have been migrants from Ireland during the Age of Catastrophe. Their journeys to Ireland were r e turns to the land of their ancestors. Fenius Farsa had a great college in Scythia that was known throughout the world. For this reason his son was an honored guest in Egypt. After his arrival, Niul set up his own seats of learning in Egypt. Legend has it that Fenius‘ (whose name is connected to Phoenix and Phoenician) people, after losing their thrones in their own lands, eventually became rulers in Egypt. One of the remembered Scythian capitals was at Galilee (\"place of the Gals\"). It was known as Scythopolis , later as Beth Shean (clearly a Gaelic term), and finally as a Beisan . The biblical term for the Scythians was \"Gog and Magog,\" meaning \"giants,\" and \"supernatural men.\" Early tribes, such as the Huns and Cimmerians, etc, referred to their own ancestors, t he Irish, as Gug and Guas. The modern consensus is that Gog and Magog referred to Russia. This is partly true since Scythia encompassed part of modern Russia (the Ukrainian and Caucasus areas). Eventually, Farsa's horde was expelled from Egypt. This drasti c action occurred, it is said, because Farsa‘s people would not assist in the \"persecution\" of the \"Israelites.\" In any case, after his expulsion, Farsa and entourage moved W es t ward toward the lands from which they had first come. This myth reveals to us that Niul and his Scythians were most probably guests of the Tuthmosside Atonist pharaohs of Lower Egypt. This would have made them rivals to the Theban Amenists of Upper Egypt who had routed the At o nists. The Amenists would certainly have considered the Scythians a danger and would have sent them packing along with their Atonist allies. Since"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"the Amenists were allied to the Druids of Ireland, the Scythians would most likely have been unwelcome guests. The Irish records clearly state that Niul was a contem porary of the biblical M o ses and that, when the Israelites were departing from Egypt, traveling toward the Red Sea, they just happened to pitch their tents near to Niul's encam p ment. At this time, Niul is said to have wandered over to meet with the Israel i tes. Allegedly, he was met by Aaron who told him of Moses and their sundry adventures in Egypt. Niul then formed a strong bond of alliance with Aaron and Moses. He gave them food and then departed into the West taking the Israelite message with him. Later, when the Israelite tribes entered into Britain, they were welcomed by the Milesian descendants of Niul who had prepared the way for the chosen people of god. W e can conclude that this fantastic tale, that is but one of many ludicrous ones concerning the m eeting of Niul and the outcasts, works as a clever fictive device concealing the fact that it was Niul and his people who were the true \"Israelites,\" or \"wise ones,\" being expelled from Egypt. In one of the concocted tales, we read that Niul‘s son, Gaedal, was bitten by a deadly serpent while swimming and was about to die when the Israelites intervened and took the boy to Moses. Moses cured Gaedal and v o wed that no serpent would ever live in the land settled by Niul and his kin. B e hind this account hides a most interesting message pertaining to occult kno w ledge, genocide, and political domination. Moses is also believed to have g i ven his own golden bracelet to Gaedal as a gift, and that this bracelet was subsequently taken to Ireland by the descendants of Ni ul and Gaedal appr o ximately 300 years later. Hector Boetius, in his History of Scotland, says, that the Gaedians were in Egypt when Moses was working wonders in that country, for the delivery of the Israelites; and the book of Irish invasions agrees with t hat computation – Geoffrey Keating ( General History of Ireland , 1809) After their departure from Egypt, Niul's group passed through the lands of the Philistines and Syrians, and made their way back to Scythia. Upon their arr i val, Niul and Gaedal warred wit h their own clansmen who had remained in Scythia and who ruled there. Political battles for supremacy raged for appr o ximately seven years until Gaedal and his army were routed and expelled from Scythia. During their travels out of their homeland, the legen ds say that the expelled Scythians were directed by a prophet to proceed to Ireland. Hist o rians believe that they did so, but only after 130 years had elapsed, and after they had resided near Crete in the Mediterranean, at a place called Gothia. From Gothi a, under a new leader called Bratha, they made their way to Spain, conquering most of that country. Breogan, grandfather of Mile, was the son of this Bratha, the conqueror of Spain. This Cretan sojourn is interesting since it provides an answer to the ques tion of why Minoan artwork was found in Av a ris, the Hyksos (Atonist) capital of Egypt. If"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"the Scythians and Atonists were allies, and if the former spent time in Crete, then it is logical to expect the allies to have exchanged all manner of merchandise. W e would expect there to have been considerable commerce between Scythia, Crete, and Egypt. One of the most important figures in the saga of the Spanish invasions of Ireland was Mile, grandson of Breogan. The name Mile comes from Miledh, m e aning \"warrior.\" T he word military appears to have derived from this root. It is from Mile's name that we get the term used for the late invaders of Ireland, namely \"Milesian.\" Mile decided he wished to leave Spain and return to Scy t hia in order to pay a visit to his kinsme n. He received a good welcome and went on to acquire great fame in his ancestral land. However, as his fame and power grew Refloir, king of Scythia, fearing he would be overthrown by the popular Mile, began plotting his death. The plan was discovered by Mi le who killed his rival Refloir. After this incident Mile set sail from Scythia and made for Egypt, the land that had favored and then exiled his own ancestor Niul. L e gend has it that Mile was warmly welcomed by the ruling pharaoh (presumably of Lower Egyp t) who bestowed land upon him and his friends. At this time the pharaoh was warring with the Ethiopians, and Mile decided to reciprocate the pharaoh's kindness by joining forces with the Egyptians against their rivals. Mile's heroic feats won him more favo r with the Egyptians. The pharaoh off e red Mile his daughter in marriage. Her name was Scota. While residing in the land of the pharaohs, Mile and his people became initi a tes of the mystery schools and became adept in magic and healing. Eventua l ly, however, remembering the prophesy that had mentioned Ireland, Mile dec i ded to leave Egypt and head back to the W est. His venture may have been endorsed by the Atonist pharaoh. Along the way, Ir and Colpa, the sons of M i le and his Egyptian wife Scota, were born. Ac cording to the fanciful legends, Mile had thirty - two sons in all, born from various wives and concubines. There is a lurid, fantastic, and propaganda - ridden monkish account of this Gaelic exodus in the Yellow Book of Lecan . The characteristic portrayal of the Egy p tians as ruthless oppressors alerts us to the identity and intention of the au t hors: We are born from the children of Mile, of Spain. After the building of the tower of Ni m rod and the confounding of languages, we went to Egypt on the invitation of the Phar a oh, kind of Egypt. Nel, son of Fenius and Goedel Glas were our chiefs when we were in the South. That is why we were called Fene, from Fenius, and Gaels from Goedel Glas...When we were in Egypt, Scota, daughter of Pharaoh the king, was given as wi fe to Nel, son of Fenius. That is why she is our ancestor and why we are called Scots from her. The night when the children of Israel escaped from Egypt and crossed the Red Sea dry - footed with Moses, son of Amram, the leader of God's people, and when Phara oh and his army were drowned in the sea after keeping the Hebrews in captivity, our a n cestors did not go with the Egyptians in pursuit of God's people and therefore feared Pharaoh's anger. They feared lest the Egyptians reduce them to"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"slavery as they had p reviously done the children of Israel. So they fled one night on Pharaoh's vessels a c ross the shallow Red Sea to the boundless ocean around the North West of the world. They passed the Caucasian Mountains, Scythia, and India, crossed the Caspian Sea which lies there, crossed the Palus Maeotis and arrived in Europe; from the South East Mediterranean to the North West, right of Africa, they passed the columns of Hercules on their way to Spain and thence to this island...It was Ith, son of Breogan But let us r eturn to the journey of Ith, son of Breogan. One spurious legend states that while in Spain Ith built a high tower from which he espied the sh i ning cost of Ireland. In a rather embellished and fantastic tale, Ith decides to check out this far off land taki ng a few comrades with him on the trip. He is b e lieved to have landed at Derry ( Aileach Neid ) in the North of Ireland, a major stronghold of Danu's People. Ith presented himself before the three De D a nann kings (Mac Cuill, Mac Cecht, and Mac Greiné) who ha d succeeded the high king Nuada after his death in battle against the Fomorians. (His tomb, known as Grianan Aileach , the \"Place of the Sun,\" lies at Inishowen Peninsula, between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle, not far from Derry city). The legends say that Ith was greeted by men who spoke a pure form of Gaelic. Historians claim the Milesians were able to understand their lingo since, a few centuries before, during the time of the great Scythian colleges (those founded by F e nius Farsa), all languages of the k nown world had been researched, studied, and taught. Ith was neither trusted nor accepted. The De Dannan kings, sensing he was operating as a vanguard for invaders, decided to take his life. His remains supposedly lie in a locale known as \"Ith's Plain.\" Ev entually, after Ith's comr a des returned home to Spain to tell of his fate his kinsman, Mile (pr. Meel ) ga t hered an army to vengefully attack the De Dannan at their capital Drumcain (\"Place of the Serpents,\" later known as Temhair, or Tara) and invade their sacred land. Accompanying Mile on this journey of belligerence was the bard Amergin and eight sons, including Colpa, Ir, and Eber. One son had the su g gestive name Aranon (like Aaron ). The most aggressive and oldest son of Mile was called Don (as in Adon ). He and his line were, suggestively, cursed by a goddess of the De Dannan. Ir and Colpa perished from drowning. At this point the myth becomes most \"poetical\" which, in our view, signals its importance and veracity historically . The army of Mile move towar d Tara and, as they went, they met in succession three goddesses who were consorts of the three kings of Ireland. The names of the goddesses were Banba, Fotla, and Eri. At each encounter the Milesians admit their purpose and speak of their desire to take c ontrol over the land and to destroy the De Dannan. After listening, each goddess persuades Mile to name the country after them. Mile is said to have obeyed their strange requests which is why Ireland has through history borne the names of each De Dannan go ddess."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"\"Welcome, warriors,\" she cried. \"To you who have come from afar this island shall henceforth belong, and from the setting to the rising sun there is no better land. And your race will be the most perfect the world has ever seen\" - (supposed words of De Dannan goddess Eri to king Mile) The Tuatha Dé Danann remained masters of Ireland until the coming of the Milesians, so named from an eponymous Mile...Ith, having been sent to reconnoitre, was slain, and the Milesians now invaded Ireland in force. In s pite of a mist raised by the Druids, they landed, and, having met the three princes who slew Ith, demanded instant battle or surrender of the land. The princes agreed to abide by the decision of the Milesian poet Amairgen, who bade his friends re - embark an d retire for the distance of nine waves. If they could then effect a landing, Ireland was theirs. A magic storm was raised, which wrecked many of their ships, but Amairgen recited verses, fragments, perhaps, of some old ritual, and overcame the dangers. Af ter their defeat the survivors of the Tuatha Dé Danann retired into the hills to become a fairy folk, and the Milesians (the Goidels or Scots) became ancestors of the Irish - J. A. MacCulloch ( The Religion of the Ancient Celts ) The incantation of the Miles ian poet Amergin is as follows: I implore that we may regain the land of Erin, We who have come over the lofty waves, This land whose mountains are great and extensive, Whose streams are clear and numerous, Whose woods abound with various fruit, Its rivers and waterfalls are large and beautiful, Its lakes are broad and widely spread, It abounds with fountains on elevated grounds! May we gain power and dominion over its tribes! May we have kings of our own ruling at Tara! May Tara be the regal residence of o ur many succeeding kings! May the Milesians be the conquerors of its people! May our ships anchor in its harbours! May they trade along the coast of Erin! May Eremon be its first ruling monarch! May the descendants of Ir and Eber be mighty kings! I implore that we may regain the land of Erin, I implore! Two great battles ensued between the remaining sons of Mile and the De Danann. These were commenced at Glenn Faisi Valley of the Slieve Mish Mou n tains near Tralee in County Kerry, where the tomb of Scota (wh o allegedly died during the battle) stands to this day; and at Talti (or Telltown) in Country Meath. Don the accursed, and three other sons of Mile, fell in battle although ultimately the De Dannan were overcome and their three kings killed. Since Don was killed it was Eremon, the second son of Mile, who became the first Milesian king of Ireland. However, Mile's third son Eber (like Hibiru , or"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Hebrew ) also saw himself as ruler. Finally, the country was partitioned so that both sons could be regional kings. ...eight of the chieftains of the Milesian host perished at sea, by the Druidic enchan t ments of the Tuatha de Dananns, namely Ir...Aranan, who fell off the mast, and Donn, who was drowned, with five other chiefs...Eight noble ladies, also, had now fallen - Dr. Geoffrey Keating ( The History of Ireland: From the Earliest Period to the English Invasion, 1629) From these sundry myths we realize that the Atonists had arrived in Ireland to found a new empire. These legends clearly coincide with the details of Akh e naton's own expulsion from Egypt. Since he and his priests of the sun had b e en expelled by force from their own land they set about conquering the land of the ancestors they took for gods. The Milesian conquest of Ireland is, theref o re, in our understandi ng, the Atonist conquest. Keating assures his readers that \"the Milesians, from the time they first conquered Ir e land, down to the reign of Ollamh Fodhla, made use of no other arms of distinction in their banners than a serpent twisted round a rod, after t he example of their Gadelian ancestors\" - James Bonwick ( Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions ) The Scots referred to the king of the Milesians, the husband of Scota, not as Mile but as Gaythelos (or Gathalus) and also understood that he had dwelt in Egypt under the protection of the ruling pharaoh. The story of Gaythelos can be found in the monkish chronicle known as the Scotichronicon, or \"Chronicle of the Scots.\" The relevant passage on this Egyptian exile makes fascinating reading, especially when we kno w what was really being said between the l i nes and cover names. In the time of Moses there was a certain king of one of the kingdoms of Greece, called Neolas. He had a son who was good looking but mentally unstable, Gaythelos by name. Since he had not been permitted to hold any position of power in the kingdom he was provoked to anger, and with the support of a large number of friends he inflicted many disasters on his father's kingdom. He greatly outraged both his father and the inhab i tants (of the country ) with his violent behavior. So he was driven out of his native land and sailed off to Egypt; and there, since he was outstandingly brave and daring and of royal descent, he was united in marriage with Scota the daughter of Pharaoh Chencres It is important to note that the pharaoh mentioned in the Scotichronicon as Chencres was none other than Akhenaton. The ancient Egyptian historian Manetho, who compiled the first dynasty's king lists, referred to Akhenaton by the Greek Achencres."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"The identity of Scota is of central concern. A well known figure in Irish mythology, she has been revealed to have been princess Meritaten, the eldest daughter of Akhenaton and Nefertiti. She is known to have mysteriously disappeared after the fall of her father and the death of several of family members from a virulent plague that had swept the land. Since Scota was a direct descendant of the chief Atonists of Egypt, and one of their highest dignitaries, if follows that her husband, regardless of what country he actually came fro m, was a member of the Solar Cult. Yes, Mile, like his Scythian forefathers, Bratha, Breogan, and Niul, was clearly a powerful and privileged ally of the Atonist pharaohs of Lower Egypt. Nevertheless, foreign princes and kings did not just marry Egyptian p rincesses as a matter of course. Such events were very rare indeed. There were edicts against this occurrence from the earliest days of Egyptian history. It would have been a marked sign of rebellion had a princess of her own volition married a foreigner. She would have lost both her standing and wealth after such an act. So we can only conclude that this angry and warlike husband of Scota was described so because of his apparent arrogance coupled with his belief in his own destiny, as a commander of the ho meless Atonists. In this respect, Mile appears to have been as d e ranged as his step - father Akhenaton. He and Scota probably got on like the proverbial \"house on fire.\" Scota - real name Meritaten (\"Mary of Aton\" or Beloved One of Aton\"). She was the el dest daug h ter of Akhenaton and wife of the Scythian noble Mile, whose sons went on to conqueror Ireland. Scota, or a daughter of the same name, is buried in Country Kerry. We know from the Amarna letters - the foreign archives of the Eighteenth Dynasty, a period of rule that lasted roughly from 1575 to 1335 BC, - that it was not the custom of Egyptian kings to give their daughters in marriage to foreign rulers - Lorraine Evans ( Kingdom of the Ark ) That Ireland was originally called Scota before the third c entury AD is fairly well known. Amongst others, Claudian, Orosius, Marianus, Scotus, Isidore and Bede all mention that Ireland was called Scota - Ralph Ellis ( Scota: Queen of the Scots ) The relevant legends report that Gaythelos and Scota eventually fell f oul of the Egyptians and departed with their company, eventually sailing W estward to Spain and Ireland."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"From palace and tomb reliefs at Amarna we know that Akhenaten‘s queen was Nefertiti and that the royal couple had no sons.

Even though he was not Egyptian by birth he bore a distinctive Egyptian title. ...the general thrust of the evidence thus far points towards an unknown prince called Gaythelos...marrying the daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaton...this fact also places Gayth e los' life squarely within the Amarna era, and so there may well be a number of texts that detail such a royal marriage, and so allow us to positively identify Gaythelos - Ralph Ellis Most histori ans prefer to emphasize the Spanish origins of the Milesians (or Gaels) and are wary of delving into the Egyptian question.

This anecdote again affords us evidence of the fraudulence of the apologists for the East to W est movement of ci vilization. The cult of stone worship was known in Ireland and throughout the world thousands of years before the rise of the Israelites. In Irish mythology the Stone of Fal was not brought to Ireland for the first time by the Milesians; it already existed there as one of the four great treasures of Ireland. It had been brought there centuries, if not millennia, before by the Tuatha de Danann whose homelands lay in the W est. Two details of importance remain to be discussed regarding the conquest of Ireland by the Milesians from Egypt. Firstly, we do not believe the Milesians were a single tribal unit residing only in Spain before their conquest of Ireland. W e believe they were Atonists and that they had many confederates throu g hout Europe. They were certainl y closely allied to the Scythians, Cretans, and Egyptians. Their confederates probably aided and abetted their various ca m paigns of conquest. Secondly, we think that the Druidic Order within Ireland were De Dannan sympathizers and therefore anti - Milesian. And we believe their antipathy to the Atonists to be the reason for their eventual downfall and annihilation. W e do not believe the Romans just took it into their own heads to commit genocide on a race they appear to have highly regarded. In other words, t he motive for the destruction of the Druids was due to politics within Ireland and not raging animosity from abroad as we have been led to believe. Once the Milesians had established themselves, they could easily have do w nplayed the ancient connections bet ween Ireland and Egypt. They could do whatever came into their heads. They could account for the strange Irish sy m bolism and word roots in the bible, and could make the world believe that Easterners had brought the elements of civilization. Every trace of what exi s ted before would be erased so no one would suspect anything was amiss. The history of Ireland and Albion began when the Atonists, and their funded hist o rians, said it started. That which existed prior to the official dates given by th e se Atonists and their apostles was a strange fanciful \"Mythological Cycle,\" of little concern. So it has remained for thousands of years. Conspiring with their fellows in Europe, the Atonists of Ireland eventually brought destruction to their nemesis, the Druidic Orde r. This they accomplished by way of the Roman a r my. By guile and treachery, the Atonists brought ruin to the land of Ireland. Their agents quickly sought out and murdered the majority of the Bards, and with them perished the true history of Ireland.

After their decimation, nothing stood in the way of the total Atonist appropriation of Ireland, Scotland, W ales, and England. Emperor Claudius declared Druidic practices illegal in AD 54, the Druids' future in R o man Britain became increasingly uncertain. In AD 61, the Romans planned a massacre of the defiant Druids at Anglesey, the centre of their culture, and their last stronghold in consolidated Britain. As th e Roman soldiers waited for the tide to recede so they could cross the Menai strait that separates Anglesey from the mainland, the Druids held their position by lining up along the opposite shore and, as Tacitus reports in his Annals, 'raising their hands to heaven and screaming dreadful curses.' But curses were not enough. The Roman soldiers crossed the strait and conquered the island, destroying both the Druids and the sacred groves of their religion - Leigh Ann Berry ( British Heritage Magazine , March 199 7) The Druids...were mostly put to the sword...when the Roman Christian doctrines were brought to them. In America it was the same. As soon as the Spanish Roman priests arrived they persecuted all the Solar and Stellar people, overthrew their temples, and scattered them with fire and sword - Albert Churchward ( Arcana of Freemasonry ) In the twelfth century, when English king Henry II decided to invade Ireland, he had to ask permission from the Roman pope who granted him his wish after clearly establishing wh o it was that ruled Ireland for all time.

Dermot followed Henry to Aquitaine, s eeking an audience.

In 1171, Henry a rrived from France, declaring himself Lord of Ireland. All of the Normans, along with many Irish princes, took oaths of homage to Henry, and he left after six months. He never returned, but he later named his young son, the future King John of England, Lor d of Ireland.

He crushed the proud with help from the white heavens and he purified Ireland with its green plains and its great race - (Thesaurus Paleohibernicus, Vol II)"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"After their conversion, the Celts, sons of Milesius, thought that the gods still existed in the hollow hills, their former dwellings and s anctuaries, or in far - off islands, still caring for their former worshippers. This tradition had its place with that which made them a race of men conquered by the Milesians - the victory of Christianity over paganism and its gods having been transmuted in to a strife of races by the euhemerists. The new faith, not the people, conquered the old gods. The Tuatha Dé Danann became the Dao i ne - sidhe, a fairy folk - J. A. MacCulloch ( The Religion of the Ancient Celts ) While recounting the story of the Children of Mil, a few historians remind us that having defeated the Tuatha De Danann the brothers, Eber and Eremon, each desiring to be kings over Ireland, fell to quarreling and fighting. They a d mit the so - called \"Historical Cycle\" of Ireland opened with divisivenes s and conflict. Humans had defeated the gods. Christianity had defeated paganism, and the rivers ran with blood. The Irish race of today is popularly known as the Milesian Race, because the genuine Irish (Celtic) people were supposed to be descended from M ilesius of Spain, whose sons, say the legendary accounts, invaded and possessed themselves of Ireland a thousand years before Christ - Seumus McManus ( Story of the Irish Race ) The Milesians are better known to historians as the Gaels, Goidels, or Goid e lics . They have been considered \"Celts\" with ethnic and linguistic connections to the Brythonic Celts of Belgium, France, and Spain. The Brythonic and Go i delic \"Celts\" were probably related but we find it difficult to accept that the G a els were purely Celtic. Some historians doubt whether they were related to the problematically named \"Celts.\" In the first place, as we delineated in the pref a ce to this volume, the ambiguous term \"Celtic\" does not define a race. It only serves to distinguish loosely affiliated g roups and tribes believed to have orig i nated in Central and Eastern Europe, in the Danube Valley region, Balkans, and Ukrainian steppes, to be precise. The Celts are now, more correctly, re c koned to be a branch of the Indo - European racial family. However, we know that the Milesian - Gaels were originally Scythians who may, or may not, have been Celts. Due to recent discoveries, we also know that the Scythian - Gaels were established figures in Egypt and that their princes took Egyptian brides. Indeed the word G ael can be rendered Gadelic, Gadael, Gaedhal, or Gad e lian , after a Roman word for Northern Africa, Gaetulus or Gaetuli. The term Gael , therefore, emphasizes the Egyptian - Scythian - Gaelic connection. Mile, king of the Scythians, had been in Egypt during the time of the Akhenaton. He was a privileged guest and resident of Akhenaton's court, and was wedded to the pharaoh's eldest daughter, ardent Atonist Meritaten. As recent discoveries show, Akhenaton and his Atonists were themselves either directly related to , or at least closely affiliated with, the Hyksos people of the Delta region who had ruled Lower Egypt as great but unloved pharaohs. These Hyksos closely resemble the Minoans of Crete, and possibly the Amorites of Babylon and S y ria. Although the Hyksos we re most probably Indo - European, evidence su g gests that they had cross - bred with"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Nubians, Sudanese, Africans, Asians, and various Semitic groups. If their Scythian friends engaged in a similar practice, it would partly account for the physiological, linguis tic, and temperamental v a riety of the various \"Celtic\" groups that appeared in Spain, France, Ireland, and Britain. Anthropologists have always been perplexed as to how the \"Celts\" a p peared short, round - headed, and swarthy, and also as tall, narrow - headed, and fair. These Celts were, obviously, two extremes of a wide spectrum of r a cial specimens from the Indo - European family. Unlike modern anthropologists and historians, these ancient peoples did not, in our opinion, care one jot about race. What was import ant to them was religion, and spiritual belief. The origin and movements of the people whom we think of as the Celts remain elusive. Few of the ancient Celts are likely to have thought of themselves as such; it was the Greeks and Romans who called them Kei toi and Celtae, Galatai and Galli. The Greek form Keltoi goes back as early as 500 BC, and may have been a corruption of the name Galatai, the Galatians. Galli also may be a shortened form of this - H. R. Ellis Davidson ( Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions ) \"Celt\" is now a term that skeptics consider so corrupted in the archaeological and p o pular literature that it is worthless - Stephen Oppenheimer ( The Origins of the British: A Genetic Detective Story ) In Latin, Angl o - Saxon, W elsh, German, and Irish, Gal meant \"foreigner,\" or \"stranger.\" The Gaels were therefore considered, by those they supplanted, to be unrelated, strange, and different. Interestingly, geological and meteorological evidence suggests that dramatic ch anges in climate may have spurred Northern European \"Celtic\" tribes, such as the Scythians, to abandon their natural habitats. In the years following the late Bronze Age (1200 BC) Greece received Dorians from the North, and Ir e land allegedly endured an inf lux of \"Celts\" from the East. ...there were major physical upheavals in Northern Europe towards the end of the Bro n ze Age, which resulted in whole scale migrations of peoples. The Celts left their early homeland in the Harz Mountains to spread throughout N orthern and Western Germany, along the Baltic and North Sea coasts. Before long they had established trade relations with their neighbors around the Elbe and in the British Isles, particularly in Ireland - Jean Markale ( The Celts )"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 . The Inherit ors of Remnants ...the Goidels did not regard themselves as the builders of the great megalithic funerary chambers, which became the dwellings of the gods - M. R. Dobie ( The Rise of the Celts ) It is not the Milesians who overly concern us. It is the conque st of Ireland and the gradual eradication of the original Megalithic culture that once thrived th e re. It is also the gradual appropriation of the Gnosis of the Druids. The Atonists absorbed many tropes from the Elders they supplanted. They did so in Egypt with their rivals, the Amenists of Thebes, and followed suit after their conquest of Ireland. Indeed, as we show in Volume Two, Christianity and Atonism are both rooted in Druidism or, more correctly, in a corruption of prehistoric Druidism. The strange mi x of Druidism and Christianity that arose from Ireland d u ring the Celtic, or historical period, is known as Culdaism, from the so - called \"Culdees.\" They were the monkish and hermetic sect that had colleges, chu r ches, and monasteries throughout Ireland and W estern Europe. The Culdees continued to exist through the Middle Ages and beyond. Intere s tingly, the authors Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe have proven that these Irish Culdean monks had been hired for generations as tutors of elite families throughout Eu rope. They particularly highlight the role the Culdees played t u toring the super wealthy and influential Catholic dynasties of Burgundy France. The authors suggest that these families, and others of the so - called occult \"Salt Line\" order, went on to form t he infamous Knights Templar organization that would play a key part in the Crusades. Research into the Templars and their affiliated \"Salt Line\" dynasties reveals that the Crusades were not instig a ted and participated in for the reasons mentioned in most o fficial history books. If the Atonist Milesians were behind the Irish Culdees, and the Culdees educ a tors of the richest and most despotic secret societies of France and Europe, then the seizure of land and sacred sites in the holy land takes on a whole ne w significance. It is a certainty that Druidic symbolism and learning perme a tes the various secret societies of the world. It also permeates Christianity. Culdaism was one cause of this infusion. But the tropes and idioms of Dru i dism had been influencing d ynasties, governments, religions, occult societies, and human minds, from the remotest periods. Culdaism was nothing more than a corruption of Druidism. W e contend that it was an Atonist corruption."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"The History of the Culdees has ever been a mystery, and e ver will be so. It is by no means easy to determine how far they were a theological sect connected with the Church, or a theosophic sect connected with the Lodges of Initiation – ( Collier‟s Eccles i astical History , vol. II) The Culdee establishment had now acquired a firm footing in the nation. Some of its members not only excelled in astronomy, poetry, and rhetoric, but also in philosophy, mathematics, and several other arts and sciences (which exactly correlates with the learned Druid magi)...It is among the Scottish Culdees, that we are to look for that pure pattern of Christian life, such as was exemplified in the African, Greek and Egyptian Anchorites – Rev. Alexander Low ( History of Scotland from the Earliest Period, to the Middle of the Ninth Century , 18 26) It may be significant that the name Culdean is believed to mean \"strangers among us.\" Strangers we ask? Or need we ask? And yet what could be stra n ger than Atonism? If an aberration exists in time and space Atonism fits the bill. The name by which the British Church was first known in these lands was the Culdee Church, the natural result of Christianity having been introduced by the Culdich or ―refugees.‖...The Culdees established Christian churches, monasteries and colleges, chiefly in remote places...Eurg ain, daughter of Caradoc and wife of Salog, Prince of old Sarum, found a college of twelve Christian Druids (Culdee Initiates) at Caer Urgan, or Llantwit Major. This college must therefore have been established in the first century – Isabel Hill Elder ( Cel t, Druid and Culdee ) The Culdean (Christian) Church of Britain was an Atonist Church. The Church of Rome was similarly an Atonist Church. Britain and not Rome was the real incubator of what we know today as Judeo - Christianity. The noble families of Milesia n (Atonist) Britain were closely associated with the various important bishops of Rome. W e can think of Rome as the administrative center of At o nist Christianity. It was not the ideological center. The Atonists of Britain real i zed that they were not going to be able to successfully maintain their empire from the far W estern lands. This is why they coveted Rome. It was strategica l ly placed for the designs of the empire builders reposing in the paradisiacal W estern Isles, the homelands of their ancient forebe ars. In any case, the Roman Church eventually frowned upon the idiosyncratic ve r sion of Christianity practiced by the Culdees of Ireland, in the same way that it later frowned upon the Templars. W e believe this was due to the fact that pri n ciples of Irish Druidism were too apparent and conspicuous in Culdaism. In the Culdean tradition, the Atonist quality of Christianity appeared to be infused and adulterated with pagan elements. This had to be curtailed lest the whole the o logy suffer. As we know, the offic ial Church of Rome did not spare heretics or those contaminated by overtly pagan paradigms. It knew that this kind of co n tamination was bound to occur and it acted efficiently and even ruthlessly to purge the offending individual or sect. Eventually, the R oman"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Church accused the Culdees of espousing heretical beliefs and acting in unholy ways. Irish Culdaism was efficiently eradicated by the hard liners in Rome who wanted no trace of their nemesis to openly exist. Culdaism was swept away as Druidism had bee n before it. The Culdee churches, the Cistercian network of monast e ries, and the Roman Church itself, stood where the great Druidic colleges had once been. They were Druidism's corruption and destroyers. After the age of the Gaels, the official history boo ks tell us that there were at least four other important waves of visitation, as follows: The Picts - who finally ended up in Scotland, but whose relics have been found all over Ireland and Britain. The Britons - (Brythonic Celts possibly related to the Ga els) who arrived around 500 BC The Belgae - (Belgian Celts) who crossed over during the time of Julius Ca e sar The Caledonians - Roman term for tall red - haired Germans related to the Belgae and Picts. They gave their name, Caledonia, to ancient Scotland Th ese four invaders considered their Gaelic predecessors to be an illustrious branch of their own \"race.\" W hat they thought of the predecessors to the G a els, the Tuatha de Danann and Megalithic Arya is not known. Each of these groups made use of the Megalith ic sites such as Tara, Newgrange, and St o nehenge, etc, and so, because of their presence and tampering, evidence of the original builders is scant indeed. The meaning formerly given to Tuatha Dé Danann was \"the men of science who were gods,\" danann being h ere connected with dán, \"knowledge\" - J. A. MacCulloch ( The R e ligion of the Ancient Celts ) The Tuatha - G. W. Atkinson supposes, \"must be the highly intellectual race that impo r ted into Ireland our Oghams, round towers, architecture, metal work, and, above all, the exquisite art which has come down to us in our wonderful illuminated Irish manus c ripts.\" The polished Tuatha were certainly contrasted with the rude Celts. Arthur Clive declares that civilization came in with an earlier race than the Celts, and r etired with their conquest by the latter - James Bonwick ( Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions ) For all these peoples, whether Hyperboreans, Cimmerians, Cimbrian, or even Tuatha de Danann are represented as belonging to a race of mysterious origins which l ives at the ends of the earth and was supposedly driven from its original home.

This ancient \"double - cross\" emblem is still used today by Christians, Masons and Templars After the alleged arrival of the Belgae, Britain was to become a province of the Roman Empire. The Romans, brutal and cruel as they were, made expert use of co mplicit sycophantic British ―puppet‖ chieftains to rule the tribes in their name. Some of these vassals were loyal to the Roman Emperors and were awarded power and riches for services rendered. After the Roman Empire collapsed, due to the successful spread of \"barbaric\" tribes, Britain was conquered by Norwegian Vikings, Danish Jutes, and Germanic Saxons. It was during and after this wave of invasion and settlement that the British became known as the \"Anglo - Saxons,\" or as the \"English,\" from Angle - Land .

They were part of a great and ancient legacy that modern historians pay little mind to.

From letters, to writing, to art, astronomy, architecture, poetry, and drama, etc, the Greeks and Romans benefited from their absorption of foreign cultural and theological elements. It is almost impossible to point to something in Greek and Roma n culture that is original . ...we have thousands of inscriptions in which a god is called by the name of the Roman deity to whom he was assimilated...The process was aided by art. Celtic gods are re p resented after Greco - Roman or Greco - Egyptian models. Som etimes these carry a native divine symbol, or, in a few cases, the type is purely native, e.g. that of Cernunnos.

As the Roman soldiers waited for the tide to recede so they could cross the Menai strait that separates Anglesey from the mainland, the Druids held their pos ition by lining up along the opposite shore and, as Tacitus reports in his Annals, 'raising their hands to heaven and screaming dreadful curses.' But curses were not enough.

The same people who understand that there was a worldwide Grecian, and later Roman, empire rarely question the phenomen on of cultural assimilation.

W e know that its light was extinguished by force, and yet we s e em reluctant to question why such heinous events took place. They occurred because there was deep antipathy between the Druids and Romans. The l a t ter were sure that the Druids were not to be trusted to keep the peace. The Roman governors knew their rule would be undermined by the Druids who tr a veled all over the country stirring up anti - Roman sentiment and spurring the people to rebel against fore ign control. This patriotic anti - colonial stance was one political reason that contributed to the annihilation of the British Druids. Most scholars accept that it was the main factor in their slaughter. However we maintain that it was ideological differenc es between the Druids and the R o mans that really signaled the former's demise. It was not merely to quell civic disobedience and social antagonism that troops were dispatched to massacre the British Druids. W iping out the Druids and Bards was a sure way to incite rage amongst their conquered subjects, and so we cannot wholly accept the theory that contends the destruction was due merely to anti - Roman politics. Some of the reasons for the extermination of the Druids by the Romans are summarized by Professor Jean Markle who, in 1972, wrote: When Rome spread its empire over the whole Mediterranean and into part of Western Europe, care was taken to eliminate anything that might harm its socio - political organ i zation. This is very evident in Celtic countries. The Romans pursued the Druids until they disappeared into Gaul and later into Britain. The Druids represented an absolute threat to the Roman State, because their science and philosophy dangerously contr a dicted Roman orthodoxy. The Romans were materialistic, the Druids spiritual. For the Romans the State was a monolithic structure spread over territories deliberately org a nized into a hierarchy. With the Druids it was a freely consented moral order with an entirely mythical central idea...The Romans looked upon women as bearers of children and objects of pleasure, while the Druids included women in their political and religious life...The talent of the Romans in ridding themselves of the Gallic and British elites is always considered astonishing, but this leaves out of account the fact that it was a ma t ter of life or death to Roman society - ( La Femme Celte ) Higgins wrote of the Druids and their rebellion against foreign domination. W e see from his words that the Romans would never have been able to establish the ir corrupt empire over the British Isles, and the world, as long as the ze a lous patriots and devotees of truth continued drawing breath: The Druids were the most strenuous assertors of their country's liberty...against the Romans, constantly exciting their countrymen, after every defeat, to fresh insurre c tions...So determined were they, that neither by Romans, Saxons, Danes, nor Normans, could they ever be conquered either in Britain or Ireland; but as they could not succe s sfully resist the overwhelming num bers and superior discipline of their enemies in the plain country, they retreated, with the highest spirited and most intractable of their countrymen, into the mountains of Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, where they succe s sfully defied the legions of the Ro man and Saxon barbarians.

Caesar himself says that Gauls (including Celtae) looked with contempt on the short Romans. Strabo also says that Celtae and Belgae had the same Gaulish appearance , i.e. tall and fair...No classical writer describes the Celts as short and dark...Caesar's campaigns must have drained Gaul of many tall and fair Celts. This, with the tendency of dark types to outnumber fair types in South and Central Europe, may help to e xplain the growing prominence of the dark type, though the tall, fair type is far from unco m mon - J.

MacCulloch ( The Religion of the Ancient Celts ) Iona had certainly a Druidic college till the community was expelled by Columba for his own community, an d the Highlanders still recognize its as the Druid‘s Isle – James Bonwick Very soon after the conversion of Ireland to Christianity, we find the country covered with monasteries, whose complete organization seems to indicate that they were really Druidic c olleges transformed en masse – T.

The physical and ideological plunder lasted for generations.

And in place of the natural religion of the Druids, we have Judeo - Christianity with all its error, folly, and poison. The fact must not be overlooked, when speaking of the supplanting of Druidism by Christianity, that the Druids held many tenets inculcated in Christianity and the pra c tices and customs of the Christians.

The Scotichronicon, composed around the year 1430 AD, is sixteen volumes in length and was allegedly written by an Augustinian abbot by the name of W alter Bower. It is from volumes such as the Scotichronicon and Historia Brittonum, and other books of their kind, vetted and endorsed by the pope, that many of the lies concerning Irish history come. It is from many of these works that the Eastern origins of the Irish people are insinuated. This preposterous theory, propounded not only by British - Israelites and Zionists, but also by modern day writers, such as Ralph Ellis and Laurence Gardner, flies in the face of the truth and must continue to be exposed for the utter lie that it is. Eventually, the world‘s illiterat e masses forgot the role of the Megali t hic Elders of Ireland. There was barely a trace left to point to or remind the student of what had been.

Beginning in the first century A.D., the Roman Empire and the Christian Church suppressed the Druid teachings. Later, the Saxon invasion of Celtic lands eliminate d the memory of the Druids. To preserve their knowledge, the Druids went underground and swore solemn oaths of secrecy. Little information was heard about the original Druids from the 4 th to 15 th centuries. In 1486, Pope Innocent VIII issued a Papal decree condemning wi t chcraft, which led to the bloody persecution of anyone in Christian Europe who profe s sed magical powers or claimed occult beliefs. The witch hunts lasted 250 years and reinforced the secretive nature of the Druids. As the oppression of the c hurch loosened and the intellectual climate improved, some members of the Druid orders existing in the 18 th century began to go public with some teachings. Again, scholars became susp i cious of this information and categorized it as folklore - Robert Sibler ud (Keepers of the Secrets ) In the Hibbert Lectures, Professor Rhys observes, \"The Greek myth, which distressed the thoughtful and pious minds, like that of Socrates, was a survival...from the time when the ancestors of the Greeks were savages.\" May it not rather have been derived by Homer, through the trading Phoenicians, from the older mythologies of India and Egypt, with altered names and scenes to suit the poet's day and clime ? - James Bonwick ( Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions ) The greatest slander toward the Druids is the assertion that they were co m pulsive sacrificers of animals and human beings.

The Irish people have suffered untold misery through no fault of their own, but because they had what Rome coveted for her own power, a Savior, a Bible, and a spiritual sov e reignty...England was but a tool used by Rome in her striving to attain her end, namely, rec ognition as the sole source of the Divine Authority on earth - Conor MacDari It will be noted that Eire (Ireland) took no part in the wars of the Crusades, a strange thing if she belonged to the Roman Church...The very absence of the Irish from the cr u sadi ng forces tells the story in itself and is significant evidence that they did not belong to and were not affiliated in any way with the Roman Church at that time, 1096 - 1099 AD...The fact is, of course, that the Roman Church was an enemy and was at war agai nst the Irish Church and nation - ibid The Irishman's pastime of blindly fighting and murdering his brothers, instead of focusing accusation and aggression on his true enemies, has served Ireland's desecrators well.

British Israelism (sometimes called Anglo - Israelism) is a complex set of theories, not necessarily compati ble with each other, that have in common the idea that some a n cient British people and/or royal lineages were direct lineal descendants of some of the Lost Tribes of Israel. The theory has adherents among a minority of Christians, usually Protestants of Br itish descent - (Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia) The British - Israelite Movement rose to prominence in England after 1757 with the work of the eccentric Richard Brothers. It was aided and abetted by the famous eccentric Scottish Egyptologist and mason Piazzi Smith. This British - Israelite movement is closely aligned with the Zionist movement, the extremist political faction ultimately responsible for the founding of the State of Israel a f ter the Second W orld W ar. The Zionist Movement is, however, but a tentacl e of the Atonist Dragon Court of ancient Egypt. This much is confirmed by their strange ideology. The central tenets of the British - Israelites are the following: The British throne is that of King David The English royal family descends from King David The British royals, and their various European relatives, are descended from the Tribe of Judah and the Levites, by way of Zarah, the brother of Perez, son of Judah The British Empire and Church of England are the modern - day man i festation of the true kingdom of god The British have been chosen by god to build a world empire in order to rule the Earth Basically, the rational for these preposterous fascist notions, is based upon the idea that the ten tribes of Israel succeeded moving East after their captivity at"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"the hands of Assyrian King Tiglath Pilezer III. However, once we understand that the so - called ten tribes of Israel are not the same as the Atonist Judites, the British - Israelite agenda becomes transparent. The Atonists are the ones who work from behind the scenes. It is they who control the royalty of Britain. Their ancestry, as the symbolism indicates, is not purely Judaic, or even R o man, but Egyptian . The Old Testament prophet, Jeremiah, is one of the Israelites believed, by British - Israelites, to ha ve traveled to the far W est. On his journey, he was allegedly accompanied by the daughter of a pharaoh, called Tea Tephi. Jer e miah's party is believed to have reached Ireland around 400 BC, whereupon the \"Celts\" are converted to Judaism, and Tea is betroth ed to the Irish King Eochaid. According to British - Israelite tradition, Queen Tea is buried at Tara, a site allegedly named after her. In this way, and with these theories, the British - Israelite movement sought to emphasize the East to W est movement of the elements of civilization. British kings where descended from the Israelites, and that was enough. All that existed prior to this movement was unimportant. One of the best known and most widely read proponents of the British - Israelite thesis is E. Raymond Capt, but there are many others loose in the world. T o gether with many American evangelists they are funded to dispense fallacies that dupe and indoctrinate the theologically and historically uninformed. In pa r ticular, it was considered very important that Zionist theories enthrall biblical scholars in America. The artifice cannot be correctly fathomed until we take into account the scientific discoveries regarding race and ethnicity that cha l lenged the propaganda the Roman Church. The discoveries made by t we n tieth century anthropologists and archaeologists served to cast doubt upon the Romish rhetoric concerning the exploits and adventures of the \"chosen peo p le,\" and the history of the world. The British - Israelite propagandists sought to show that the Israe lites of the bible were in fact \"Aryans,\" that is, Caucasians or Indo - Europeans. The British - Israelites realized that if they conceded the I s raelites to be of Aryan (or more correctly Indo - European) racial stock, they could conceal a much greater truth and make it seem that peoples and nations of the W estern Hemisphere had received their cultural idioms from the East. Indeed, as we know now, the Israelites were Caucasians not Semites. And there were significant migrations into Britain by people from the Eas t. One of the earliest was that of the Milesians. The traditions of Ireland and Scotland inform us that this group from Egypt arrived in Ireland around 1000 BC, or probably earlier. At this time the great \"Mycenaean Drought\" ravaged vast areas of Asia Mino r and Africa, forcing desperate and homeless people to mi g rate W estward. The Children of Mile, whom this author identifies as the At o nists, may have been motivated partly because of their forced expulsion from Egypt or because, as the records state,"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"they w ished to return to visit their a n cestral tribal lands in Scythia. Additionally, we read in the bible of the Assyrian and Babylonian attacks on Jerusalem and of the captivity of the twelve tribes. The scriptures tell us that ten of the twelve tribes (those of the House of Israel) did not make the return journey to Jerusalem but dispersed into the lands of the W est, across the Caucasus Mountains. They are the famous \"lost\" tribes of Israel. The Israelites took with them their symbolism that allegedly adorns t he heraldry and architecture of W estern kingdoms. Migrations of this sort may be compared to those of Jews into England during the time of Oliver Cromwell, in the early 17th century. At that time fanatical Christian intellectuals and nobles, such as Cromwe ll, believed their ancestors to have been the \"chosen people\" of the East and that the \"Messiah\" was about to make a return in their time to preside over the end of the world. Cromwell, and his Jewish and Venetian backers (particularly Manasseh ben Israel) , exploited this apocalyptic fever to the maximum, and used it to abolish the law banning Jews from entering E n gland. According to British - Israelites, it was the influx of Israelites that civilized Britain in the first place. In their minds Anglo - Saxons an d Israelites were of the same blood, race, and ideology. There are many modern day \"Cromwells\" in positions of power who firmly believe this kind of thing. British - Israelite prop a ganda has worked its magic. However, as significant as these later migrations are to historians they were simply not responsible for the rise of Druidism.

They were, instead, dedicated to the observation and the study of the Universe. The original theology and ritual of the megalithic priesthood demanded that there were no idols, no imagery and no inscri p tions, as the design of these monuments was not supposed to give away the identity of the architects or builders - Ralph Ellis (Eden in Egypt) The \"Israelites\" were indeed of Indo - European stock.

They came into the W e st around 1000 BC. Actually, they were brought back by those whose ancestry lay in the W est. Through the deliberate and pernicious tampering with the meaning of terms, names, and titles, this simple truth has been expertly obscured by the British - Israelite s who excel at obfu s cation. These people are the Jews, which word is derived from Yehudim, meaning, according to Josephus, \"the remnant of Judea.\" Neither are these Jews pure Israelites...Generally, the Israelites were tall and fair, the cream of the Aryan Race, as we find them in the Irish Scots, the pure English, and the Norwegians; while the Jews the \"shew of their count e nance doth witness against them,\" as Isaiah said - Fredrick Haberman Another British - Israelite mania concerns Genesis Chapter 38, and I Chronicles Chapter 6, and the verses that tell of the lineage of Judah (son of Jacob, and patriarch of the House of David). This lineage of Judah is believed by British - Israelites to still exist, having come down through one of Judah's twin sons known as Zarah , meaning \"seed.\" The second twin was known as Pharez (meaning \"breached\" but that may be more related to Pharos, meaning \"light.\") The lineage of Judah - Zarah is figuratively referred to as \"The Scarlet Thread.\" This term derived from the birth saga o f Judah's twins. According to the fanta s tic story, a midwife tied a red thread around the wrist of Pharez, the first twin to appear. However, Pharez retracted his hand with the thread and it was Zarah who came forth first. Judah's first - born was thereafter the one to carry on the royal dynasty of \"David.\" As we show in Volume Two, this term \"David\" actua l ly refers to the chiefs and commanders the Atonist pharaohs of Egypt, and to their Levite servants.

Goat Chair or Throne of the Phoenicians, with ankh crosses. The Gotts, or Goat Kings were rulers of the great \"Gothic \" civilizations One of the reasons why the \"Aryanism\" of the Israelites has been conceded was due to the radical scientific discoveries made in the 19th and 20th centuries primarily by German experts in the subjects of archaeology and anthropology. A fam ous king of Scythia was, for instance, known by the title \"Saca,\" (or Sakai , or Saka ) a word close to \"Saxon.\" Since the Saxons are considered ancestors of the \"Anglo - Saxon\" nations, the question arose as to whether they were originally Scythians from Nort h - Eastern Europe. And since Viking burial sites are similar to those of the Scythians, the question arose as to whether the latter were ancestors of the former. The British - Israelites believed so. They did not bring forth the evidence that showed that the Saca or Saka were originally Irishmen who had traveled Eastward in ancient days. A few suggestive inscriptions, and a lot of other sp u rious connections, quickly became the foundations of a preposterous historical deception. Could these have been the Scythi ans from Tartary, the desce n dants of the wise men who gave their religion and the arrow - headed letters to Assyrian - Semitic conquerors, who had come down as Turanian roamers to the Plains of Babylon, and whose Chaldaean faith spread even to Egypt and Europe ? - James Bonwick ( Irish Druids and Old Irish Religions , 1894) "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" Ptah - with goat - headed wand.

The words Saxon , Saka , and Saca , probably derive from Ztak , the stag god worshippe d by the Irish and their racial ancestors from the Megalithic and Neolithic Ages. The cult of the stag god once spread all over Britain, Europe, Scandinavia, Eurasia, and the East. The horns of the stag, a frequenter of W estern climes, represented the annu al rise and fall of the sun. Monarchs wore spiked crowns and shaman displayed horns upon their headgear to represent the stag god and his wisdom. In Ireland the lord of stags was called Cernunnos or Herne. Herne was the prototype of the Grecian Hermes. It follows, therefore, that the Irish were the first Saxons or, more correctly, \"Stag Men,\" and not the Scythians of Eastern Europe. Interestingly, the Egyptian word for stag was ayir, which connotes the Arya, or Druidic Elders.

The Druids referred to the stag god as Hu Gadam, and connected him to everlasting cycles. He also represented fertility, physical skill, and shamanic p o wer. He was the guide of those who wished to pass safely into the otherworld, the world of magic. Indeed, the word deer is not a million miles aw ay from der which (like dar and dru ) connotes the Druids. The stag was the supreme animal totem of the ancient Irish. The earliest images of the Shaman show him adorned with stag or antlers. Often denoting royalty, the stag symbol can be seen on the hera ldic arms of old Irish clans such as McCarthy The depictions of Cernunnos are strikingly consistent throughout the Celtic world. His most distinctive attribute are his stag's horns, and he is usually portrayed as a mature man with long hair and a beard. He wears a torc, an ornate neck - ring used by the Celts to denote nobility. He often carries other torcs in his hands or hanging from his horns, as well as a purse filled with coins. He is usually portrayed seated and cross - legged, in a position which some have interpreted as meditative or shamanic, although it may only reflect the fact that the Celts squatted on the ground when hunting...Cernunnos is nearly always portrayed with animals, in particular the stag. He is also frequently associated with a unique b east that seems to belong primarily to him: a serpent with the horns of a ram. This creature may have been a deity in its own right. He is associated with other beasts less frequently, including bulls (at Rheims), dogs and rats. Because of his frequent ass ociation with cr e atures, scholars often describe Cernunnos as the \"Lord of the Animals\" or the \"Lord of Wild Things\". Because of his association with stags (a particularly hunted beast) he is also described as the \"Lord of the Hunt\" - (From Wikipedia, onli ne Encyclopedia) Additionally, the early Phoenicians were known to have referred to themselves and their kings by the term Got or Gott , signifying goats. This is where we d e rive the words god and good , and where place names such as Gotland and Goteborg , e tc, come from. The Gotts were called the Goths by the Romans.

Tacitus in Germania claimed that it was the name of one tribe which gradually came into general use, and it was generally held to be linked with the Latin Germanus (brother). Because of the ambiguity of this term 'Germanic', many E n glish scholars have preferred to use 'Teutonic' for this group of peoples. The adjective Teutonicus was a Latinized form of OE peodisc from peod (people/n ation), a term a p plied by the Goths to themselves and their language; the earlier form *teuta may originally have had the meaning 'power' or 'strength' - H.

From the name gott we derive the word god . So, even though Christians consider the horned \"goat god\" to be a symbol for the devil they still, paradoxica l ly, use the ancient word gott to signify deity. The word devil appears in the Hebrew language as seirim or shoirim, meaning \"he goat.\" Clearly, at some point, the worship of the goat was thoroughly demonized. Archaeological and anthropological discoveries, made throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, continued to raise important questions about the movement of races and the origins of W estern nations. They also demanded a closer scientific look at the accounts within the bible and other scriptures. And it was this scrutiny by erudite and obj ective scholars that deeply unnerved the Judeo - Christian hegemony behind the rise of British - Israelitism. As the W estern origins of civilization began to be proven, the case for the Judaic origins looked bleak. W ith these threatening new findings their fal se claims and illustrious image of being the great \"holy people\" would go out the window. The privilege they enjoyed from their deceptions might quickly end. Therefore, something had to be done. So, it was thought best to concede a little and allow a few h istorical facts to be accepted. The Egyptian connections would still remain obscure, but it could certainly be admitted that the Israelites were not racially Semitic after all. According to the British - Israelites, the Semitic blood entered in during the Image from the Gundstrup Cauldron, one of the only au thentic Irish artifacts found.

The British - Israelite scholars have done their best not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. They have sought to involve their race with those of renown without giving the game away or revealing the actua l origins of the Jews and Israelites. Hiding the facts about who the Israelites and Judites really were was of paramount importance. A little concession then, when none at all might have cost the world was, it a p pears, negotiable after all. There are a gre at many false ideas about the Jews. They are said, for instance, to b e long to a Semitic race. There is, however, no such race: there are only Semitic - speaking people showing varying racial compositions – Professor Hans Gunther (quote from Israel‟s Racial O rigins and Migrations , by W. H. Fasken, 1934) Orientalists claim, as does Lenormant, and others, that the Semitic race, originating in Central Asia, migrated into Mesopotamia about 3000 BC, where they found a Turanian population, which they quickly overcam e and absorbed and found the Babylonian E m pire. This migration of a superior race, coming from Central Asia, is correct, but, as Shem did not come into existence until about 2400 BC, this race of immigrants have been badly misnamed by the scholars, for the y were not the Semites but their ance s tors, the Aryans, the parent white race, the name Aryan being derived from the Sanskrit word Arya, meaning noble.

And in II Esdras (Ezra) 13: 39 - 45 And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him; th o se are the ten tribes, which were carried away as prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king...But they took counsel a mong themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into further country, where never mankind dwelt, That they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land - (II Esdras (Ezra) 13: 39 - 45) Of course w e see the idiocy of these spurious passages. Since British - Israelites would have us believe the ―further‖ countries to be Ireland and E n gland, we cannot understand why these lands would be unpopulated. W hen we ask for evidence, for their assertions that th e chosen people traveled to W estern climes, the British - Israelites point to chapters 42, 43, and 49, of the Book of Isaiah : But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend...I will perceive thee and give thee for a c ovenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages...Ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"This spurious passage is offered as proof because it features the word ―c ov e nant.‖ In Hebrew this word is Berith, sometimes rendered Brith , and perhaps even Brit .

British - Israelites believe that migrations occurred before the schism between the tribes: When the twelve tribes, after their entry into Palestine, about 1445 BC, divided the land among themselves, the tribes of Dan and Simeon we re located in the south between the coast and the Dead Sea, with Judah and Benjamin north of them...After the division of the kingdom, both the tribes of Dan and Simeon were separated from their friends in Israel by the kingdom of Judah; and, as the two ki ngdoms were enemies most of the time, the people of Dan and Simeon felt themselves endangered by the people of Judah and emigrated constantly. Finally, the day came in which the whole tribe, that is, what was left of it, resolved to leave in body and seek another home - Fredrick Haberman They left, family after family, shipload after shipload, in the same way that the people of England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, and other European countries have left their nat i ve shores and come to America...after five cen turies of emigration there were still over five million Israelites left in Palestine when Solomon‘s kingdom was divided into two separate kingdoms of ten and twelve tribes - ibid ...a constant traffic had been in existence for a thousand years between Pale stine and her colonies in the west - ibid This was all the British - Israelites required to plant their ideas into the minds of Christians and Jews. Naturally, there were later migrations to the West, but to say that the W estern peoples became sophisticated and passionate about right - living and divine matters because of the visitation of Israelites is a tall o r der indeed. Professor L. A. W addell had established that the name Brith - Am may have been given to the country after the visitation and settlement there of a great Trojan hero by the name of Brutus. Brutus and his people arrived in Britain around 1100 BC. The British - Israelites attempted to establish that Br u tus was an Aryan - Jew who had traveled W estward to colonize the lands of the Aegean. To them Brutus , the Trojan - Aryan - Israelite, and name - giver to Britain, was their ancestor. He was to them a \"Covenant Man\" and ambassador of J e hovah. That the goddess Brigit (the Phoenician Baratana) was worshipped by the ancient Irish thousands of years before this Bru tus was born did not diss u ade them from drawing their conclusions. If the Brutus tale is true, and if he did indeed name the country after the Hebrew word for \"covenant,\" he probably did so, not because he was inspired by Jehovah, but because he simply r e c ognized the ancient homelands of his people and their inhabitants, for what they were - the ancestors - with whom he and so many other scattered nations had a deep and sacred covenant, or bond."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The books like Deuteronomy have been many times revised and am ended since 621 BC.

The subtext is that the Israelite monotheists are kin to the Aryan pagans who were really \"mono t heists\" worshipping the one god Jehovah. This unpalatable non sense can b a rely be stomached. The terms \"monotheist\" and \"pantheist\" are, in any case, virtually meaningless to all but the propagandist who seeks to befuddle the world's masses who have no idea how their own ancestors lived or worshi p ped.

Indra was known as the \"Hammer God,\" and he seems to r esemble Ptah, Vulcan, Thor, Odin, Dagda, Hercules, and even Zeus. The term adder ( a dar ), as used to distinguish a Druid, may derive from this name. The British - Israelites even went so far as to declare the Asian Buddha to be of Israelite origins. One of t he most important and intriguing declarations of the British - Israelites, and one that has sparked a lot of controversy, concerns the arrival in England of Jesus Christ. According to legend, Jesus did not die upon the cross but survived and subsequently tra veled through France to England with his consort Mary Magdalene. With Joseph of Arimathea and other colleagues they brought Christianity to Britain between 36 and 39 AD. This theory has been re - worked recently by several au t hors, particularly Laurence Gard ner and Tony Bushby. But long before the time of these authors the theory was beloved of the major British - Israel coterie. The flagrant propagandist Rev. R. W . Morgan from W ales, writes of the matter in his book St. Paul in Britain : Christianity was first introduced into Britain by Joseph of Arimathea...followed by Simon Zelotes, the apostle, then by Aristobulus, the first bishop of the Britons; then by St. Paul. its first converts were members of the royal family of Siluria - that is, Gladys the sister of Caradoc, Gladys (Claudia) and Eurgen his daughters, Linus his son, converted in Britain before they were carried into captivity to Rome.

Of course, the Druids of \"high rank\" are conveniently not named by the Rev e rend, and the details concerning this remarkable visit to the W estern isles by the bible's holy family are few indeed. W e do not say that such a journey could not have taken place. As we have already pointed out, Ireland a nd the British Isles were the destination of several important Eastern dignitaries. If Jesus and his closest family members made their way W estward it was, in our op i nion, not merely to escape persecution. It was a return, like so many before, to the lands of the ancestors. This is the key fact persistently overlooked by Bu s hby and those researchers who firmly believe the British Isles to have been the final repose of Jesus and the home of his progeny. Another name that has been distorted and misused is Dan . W e have all heard of the so - called Jewish \"Tribe of Dan.\" This \"Dan\" was said to be a son of J a cob and Bilhah, the maid - servant of Rachel the \"barren.\" In Irish Myth - the young solar king Lugh (lion) rides out to defend his people against the giant B alor of the Evil Eye. He kills his enemy with a sling. The story predates the rise of Judaism. Advisor to Nuada, Lugh was Ildanach (Master of All the Arts). Lugh is similar to the Hindu heroes Samson, the enemy of the Philistines, was t he famous hero from the Tribe of Dan. Moses described Dan as a ―lion‘s whelp‖ and this term alerts us since we understand the lion to be a seminal emblem for the Egyptian Cult of Aton. The term ―whelp‖ has three interesting meanings. Firstly, it refers to new - born offspring; then to the infantile cockiness of that new - born creature; and it also refers to a cog - like part of a larger mechanism. Regarding the tribes of Israel, we find this to be a most apposite description. The Danites concern us because of th e outrageous attempts by British - Israelites to identify them with the Tuatha de Danann. Although the four pre - diluvian homelands of the de Danann were nothing like Egypt or Palestine, and even though goddess worship distinguished the matriarchal Irish Elde rs, the British - Israelites insist that they and the Danites are one and the same people.

For the celestial chariot of the Gandiva the bowman is protected by the gods. No man can defeat him: don‘t set your heart on war! - ( The Vedas ) conceded that the Danite - Israelite m igrations from the East occurred approximately 677 BC, due to attacks by the Assyrians. Although the Israelites were allegedly believed to have been unwilling guests of the Assyrian Empire, during their so - called \"Captivity,\" we must realize that a larger number of Israelites did not experience this internment in Assyria and were free to migrate W est. This is conceded by British - Israelites. Regardless, the Irish de Danann are physically described as being of giant stature, blond of hair, and white in comple xion (more akin to biblical Philistines than to Danites). They may have temporarily resided in Europe after the Age of Catastrophe, but they were certainly not from there. It is likely that these W estern \"giants\" influenced the mythology of Eastern tribes who awed them for their sophistication and prowess. Characters in the bible, such as Samson and David, appear to have been based on the heroes of W estern tribes like the Tuatha de Danann whose reputation must have been known far and wide. Sagas and heroic deeds given by mythmongers to spurious characters such as David and Samson, etc, are to be found recorded in Irish legends. Accounts of deeds committed by Irish her o es were simply plagiarized by the compilers of Israelite history. The time is now right to put the record straight. The meaning formerly given to Tuatha Dé Danann was \"the men of science who were gods,\" danann being here connected with dán, \"knowledge.\" - J. A.

It is worthy of remark that while of the towns and places of Britain, he has in general given bu t the new Roman names, those of Ireland still have on his map their old Celtic titles, the city of Hybernia still tells a tale of distant times - Thomas Moore (speaking of the historian Ptolemy, in his History of Ireland ) Egyptian records reveal how Egypt was invaded by a strange seafaring people known as the Danue It is speculated that this group is the same as that me n tioned by Homer, namely, the Danoi (or Danai or Danae ). Homer's Danae were kindred to the Hellenes (called \"Greeks\" by the Romans). Homer m entioned the Danae, along with the Pelasgians, Achaeans, and Lacedaem o nians, as ancestors of the Hellenes. Research into the Danaoi reveal them to be, like their cousins the Pelasgians, the erectors of intricate yet massive M e galithic Earthworks precisely the same as those found in Ireland. Coincidenta l ly, the name Danae is common to Ireland. Indeed, it was the name of the s u preme goddess of the Irish Druids, also revered as Ana or Anu . The name Hellene (son of Deucalion) has been debated and historians see m consp i cuously vague concerning its origin. Clearly, it is of Scandinavian origins. The term Hel referred to the underworld of the Teutonic, Gothic, and Nordic (or Caucasian) peoples, and figured in mystical rites. Helen of Troy is really the Helene of th e Dorians. The letters \"T\" and \"D\" were often interchanged and, therefore, the word Trojan could be rendered Droian , Drojan , or Drohan , etc. The Dorians are listed as ancestors of the Hellenes (or Greeks). In ancient times Hell, or Hades, was a place neith er of reward or punishment, but was simply the home of the dead, good and bad alike, the word primarily signifying nothing more than the hollow grave, hole, pit, cavern, or other receptacle which receives the dead - Sarah Elizabeth Titcomb ( Aryan Sun Myths , 1899) The earliest ancestors of the Hellenes were the fascinating tribe known as the Pelasgian . They were said to have been descendants of the semi - mythical h e ro Deucalion who survived the great flood along with his wife and three sons. This character is similar in type to the Irish Nuada, the conqueror and high king of Ireland. The father of the Pelasgians was Peleg (or more likely Beleg, since most Gaelic tribes did not use the letter \"P\"). Peleg's father was known, suggestively, as Eber , a name close t o the Irish Heber ( Hebrew, Ibaru, Ibri ), meaning \"Man of the Yew\" or \"Man of Fire,\" or \"Man of the Sun.\" Indeed, in Greek, the name Helen could be rendered as Helios, the Greek word for the sun. In any case, the arrows point to Ireland more than to any oth er location for the ancestry of these Hellenes. It is known that the Pelasgians descended toward the Mediterranean from the North - West . Indeed, history records the loss of the Danae after the battle of Troy. They are said to have traveled"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"North - West toward Ireland. Scholars have proven the Pelasgians, Etruscans, Dorians, and Phoenicians to have been one and the same people, or at least intimately connected. These races were of Irish ancestry.

Dr. Clark...has given a coin which he says is evidently Phoenician: on one side is an inscription in the Phoenician language, but in Etruscan c haracters, which proves that the Phoenicians and Etruscans were the same people - Godfrey Higgins (on Dr. Clark's Travels ) Deucalion was a survivor of the flood. He brought his family to safety in an ark that he was guided to build. The Irish king Nuada di d the same thing. He and his people survived the flood in great ships they constructed. The name Nuada (Irish Nada , pronounced as Nuah ) is the root of the biblical Noah . Nuada, or Nada, is the Aztec's N a ta . The story of the slaying of a giant by a boy - king with a sling is but one Irish tale emulated by the Israelites. It was also rendered by the Greeks with their boy - hero Hercules throwing a cross - shaped projectile at a giant. This again is where the British - Israelite deviance enters. The mythmongers have t aken this proto - Hellenic Danoi for their spurious and warlike Israelite Tribe of Dan . The closeness of the names has thrust them headlong into a miasma of historical fabrication. This theory was chiefly expounded in the b o ok, Review of History, by the ecce ntric Freemasonic Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie. Petrie strove to connect the Hellenic Danae with the Hyksos invaders whom he knew to be Israelite. W ithout evidence, he situated the Danae in the fifteenth and sixteenth dynasties of Egypt, when the ruler s were the Hyksos. After the exodus (during the early 19th dynasty) the Danoi moved North with the twelve tribes of Israel and eventually settled in the Aegean as one of the first Hellenic tribes. Therefore, according to Petrie (and the British - Israelites) the Israelites are the ancestors of the Greeks. He believed this nonsense even though the Greeks are clearly one of the most idolatrous civilizations on Earth, in spite of the fact that they are adorers of the goddess, and in spite of the fact that the Da nae constructed Irish - type Megaliths such as goddess worshippers are wont to do. Petrie convinced himself of these fallacies because he marks the opening of Hellenist culture from approximately 1450 BC, when the twelve tribes were in exile from Egypt and o n route to Canaan. The fact that no ev i dence exists for a Hellenistic style civilization in Canaan does not restrain him from the idea that Greek civilization is indebted to the Israelites and to no other culture. The fact that the Phoenicians, one of the most ancient of races, had been at home in the Mediterranean and Aegean for three - thousand years d o es not appear to have deterred him from his bizarre conclusions. Petrie points out that the Grecian Jove (Jupiter) is the same as Jehovah. He does not e x plai n how Jupiter (the foremost deity of a whole elaborate pantheon of gods, and who was the son of"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Cronos the Titan) could be the same god as was venerated by the \"monotheistic\" Israelites. He is convinced that the Israelite D a nae traveled W est toward Ireland taking their Israelite customs there to civilize and save the pagans. The travelers gave their name to places such as D o netz, Danzig, Dneiper, Dneister, and Denmark, etc. In Norway, they are said to be the Donsk People. Sadly for Petrie, none of this nons ense is true. These places were not based on the Israelites who were most irreverent toward the goddess. They were named from much earlier traversals of Irish Druids, those most reverent toward their goddess Danu . The masonic Petrie, like other \"hi s torians ,\" have done their utmost to confound these facts and usurp reason. They have not succeeded. The consort of Danu was Bel. Bel or Baal was worshipped by the Hittites, C a naanites, and Phoenicians, centuries before the so - called Israelites were even heard of . Bel was the first deity of the Druidic trinity. The bells that ring out from Christian churches to this day get the name bell from the god's name (pr. bayal ). The Muslims know him still as their Al, or Allah, while to the Canaanites and Levites he was EL . The proto - Greek Pelasgians probably derive their n a me from Bel. The Hebrew god EL is merely a clever rendering of the Irish Bel. The Judeo - Christian establishment has attempted to conceal the form of a n cient worship, but many passages in the Old Testamen t still betray the truth of the Irish influence. The early Israelites were mostly sun worshipers. And even in later times, the sun god, Baal, divided with Jehovah the worship of the Jews. Saul, Jonathan, and David named their children in honor of this god. \"Saul begat Jonathan...and Esh - baal. And the son of Jonathan was Merib - baal\" (1 Chron. viii, 33, 34). David named his last son, save one, Beeliada, \"Baal Knows\" (1 Chron. xiv, 7). Solomon's worship included not merely the worship of Jehovah, but that of B aal and other gods...Most of the Israelites certainly saw no harm in these ornaments, since they were not aware of any very great differe n ce between the character of Yahweh (Jehovah) and that of Baal, Astarte, or Moloch. Long after the time of Solomon the horses and chariots of the Sun were kept in the temple (2 Kings xxiii, 11). Many of the stories concerning Moses, Joshua, Jonah, and other Bible characters are solar myths. Samson was a sun god. Dr. Oort says: \"Sun - worship was by no means unknown to the Is raelites...The myths that were circulated among these people show that they were zealous worshipers of the sun. These myths are still preserved, but, as in all other cases, they are so much altered as to be hardly recognizable. The writer who has preserved them for us lived at a time when the wor s hip of the sun had long ago died out. He transforms the sun god into an Israelite hero Samson\" - John E. Remsberg ( The Christ ) The sacred symbols of the Hittites also, including the True Cross or the Sun - Cross, or the Red Cross of St. George of Cappadocia and England and the St. Andrew Cross, are identical with those Sun crosses of the Sumerians, Trojans and Ancient Britons - L.

Therefore, it comes as something of a shock to find British - Israelites assuring us, often without a shred of real proof, that the Irish are sons of Isaac or Israel, and followers of the torah. W e ask, in all curiosity, what hallu cination or malady of the brain and senses would allow one to believe that these good Irish \"Israelites\" would, after their conversion by Jer e miah (or whomever) then, in the blink of an eye, and as soon as their creators have turned their backs, lose their wits and descend to worshipping oak trees, rivers, mountains, fire, and a whole host of powerful goddesses, Eri, Danu, Brigit, Morrigu, Badb (pr. baav), Brigantia, Cerridwen, Macha, Arianhrood, etc? Clearly, this is not the case, and the inconsistency f urther exposes the vagra n cy of British - Israelite claims concerning their interpretation of the biblical \"Israelite\" connection to Ireland and England. The pagan Irish and their godde s ses far predate the Israelites and their preposterous brooding consortles s J e hovah. More importantly, the Jehovah of the bible was a corrupt rescripting of the ancient god of the moon, worshipped in Egypt and Ireland from the earliest days. As we have shown, his name (Yehew or Yahweh) originally came from the word for the yew t ree. Of course, the references to trees and nature were stripped away by the mythmongers.

Modeling themselves on the the Virgin Mary who supplanted ancient goddesses who represe n ted fearless independence and command The Milesia ns had nothing to do with goddess worship and neither had the Christian monks who appeared in Ireland a short time later. Their churches and monasteries were physically erected over sites once sacred to the goddess, and likewise, the patristic ideology of Judeo - Christianity supplanted the naturalistic, all - inclusive, egalitarian doctrines of the ancients who reverenced the feminine principle. As Mary Condren points out in her fine book The Serpent and the Goddess , the sacred and ancient goddess remained mer ely as a humiliated appendage to the holy church of Rome.

In short, she was usurped, cast down from her exalted place, and regarded as the patron of all that is illusionary and unspiritual . Only with the intervention of the animating will of god can she, and all she represents, be kept straight and true. The Christian wed himself not to her but to the church that stood in her place.

For her origins we can look to the North of Egypt, to Mesopotamia. She may have been an aspect of the Amorite Ashtoreth or Ishtar, or even of the Irish Brigit, since she was associated with sacred groves. Apparently, this goddess was once the consort of Yahweh but was utterly removed from the Jewish pantheon. And this fact provides us with clear evidence in favor of our argument denouncing the Eastern ori gins of civilization. Migrants bring with them their customs, beliefs, gods, and goddesses, should they exist. The M i lesians did not bring goddess worship with them, nor did they assimilate such worship after their arrival. They were patristic sun - worshipp ers from day one. Their ideological descendants, rulers of our corporate super - lit world, remain so today. Throughout Europe, rivers were called after the Goddess. For instance, the various Avons are called after Abnoba, goddess of the sources of the Danub e. The Irish rivers, the Liffey and the Shannon, took their names from the goddesses Life and Sinnann.

This change in secular power coincided with the rise of sun worship under a male priesthood...Sun worship was usually intr oduced and established by an edict of a military dictator, as happened in Babylon and Egypt, and probably other countries as well Goddess worship in Ireland suffered a mortal blow during the reign of Popes Gregory I (590 - 604 AD) and Sergius (687 - 701 AD). S ergius demanded that the holy festivals of Mother Mary be synchronized to take place upon the very days rites were performed to Brigit and other pagan deities.

By the fifth century AD they had almost been completely eradicated, by which time women were also prohibited from conducting a single major Western sa c rament - Leonard Schlain ( The Alphabet Versus the Goddess ) The denigration of the goddess, and the hostilit y toward all she represented physically and psychologically, led to the repression within human beings of the feminine principle of cognition and expression. W hen the feminine aspects of personality are repressed or considered weak, low, and suspect, the m a s culine aspects dominate consciousness and behavior. Following the advent of patriarchy, social groups began to organize themselves hierarchically. As hi s tory reveals, such an unnatural status quo inevitably engenders aggressive intolerance of outsiders, and of animals, women, and nature.

The authors of the account were undoubtedly continuing with their policy of plagiarization, of adapting key Druidic leitmotifs to suit their own unoriginal canon. The incarnate god was probably representative of a god or spirit of earth, growth, or vegetation, represented also by a tree. A symbolic branch of such a tree was borne by kings, and perhaps by Druids, who used oak branches in t heir rites. King and tree would be connected, the king's life being bound up with that of the tree, and perhaps at one time both perished together. But as kings were represented by a substitute, so the sacred tree, regarded as too sacred to be cut down, ma y also have had its succed a neum. The Irish bile or sacred tree, connected with the kings, must not be touched by any impious hand, and it was sacrilege to cut it down - J. A.

The cosmogony, pantheon, and tribal structure of the Tuatha de Danann, who came to Ireland after the destruction and l oss of their Western homelands (the Isles of Finias, Murias, Gorias and Falias ), and who were a matriarchy, bear no consistent resemblance to that of the Israelites of official history. Their entire culture was totemic and based on goddess worship. Their l egends are full of magic and wizardry, and their great kings and warlords were dedicated to the spirit of their goddess, Danu, after whom their tribe was named.

After Christians had spent years destroying books and libraries, St. John Chrysostom, the pre - eminent Greek Father of the Church, proudly declared, \"Every trace of the old philosophy and literature o f the ancient world has vanished from the face of the earth\" - Helen Ellerbe ( The Dark Side of Christian History ) Danu, the supreme goddess of the ancient Irish, was also known as Ana or Anu. She is found in India as Aine (goddess of the dawn). This is whe re the name Anne comes from. This name means \"the heavens,\" and can be found as a root in many place names and words. The word Danu is believed to der i ve from Dana meaning \"heavenly waters\" or \"swift flowing.\" Indeed, the Irish Danu was associated with ri vers, and several place names in Europe and e l sewhere bear her name, for instance, Denmark, Danube , Don , Mount Dena , and possibly Jordan and its source, the river Dan . The city of Jericho, that o n ce stood on the banks of the Jordan river, was one of the ea rliest locations for wheat cultivation. It was not far from the Scythian city of Beit She'an, also known as Scythopolis (after the Scythians). As time passed Danu was rescri p ted into the Irish fire goddess Brigit. Later, Brigit was picked up by Christian m onks and rescripted as \"Saint Brigit.\" The \"bride\" at a wedding bears an Irish title. The prototype of this \"Christian\" saint is, however, Danu. The same thing occurs with the so - called anomaly, the \"Black Virgin.\" The Christian Black Vi r gin was originally the Irish goddess known as Morrigu . She was the head of the female pantheon and was the prototype for Morgan Le Fay of the Arthurian sagas. Morrigu (or the Morrigan ) was another personification of Danu.

Pharaohs and Irish Chieftains alike ruled as ambassadors for the goddess. In t he Rig Veda of India we read of Viraj , the active feminine principle. A god had to marry with the goddess in order to be animated with \"Shakti,\" the embodiment or symbol of his own energy. A man could only become pharaoh if he was born, or married, to the legally accepted female. The primordial green mound upon which kings and pharaohs were crowned represented the goddess. The mounds in which the Irish kings were buried also represented her. Her image was to be found on the ins i de of the lids of sarcophagi in which the Egyptian dignitaries were interred. From birth to death the goddess played a part in the lives of the nobility of Ireland and Egypt. She played no active part in the lives of the Israelites of the bible. The document that most powerfully exemp lifies an extremely male, patriarchal attitude is the Old Testament...It is not surprising that the subject of productiveness, the Creation itself, also finds an extreme male solution in its pages...The reason why the Old Testament exhibits such a one - sided, m ale character is that as the primary text of Jewish monotheism it represents a male victory over female deities, over the matriarchal remnants in the social structures.

Interestingly, we find that certain Christian and Judaic enclaves (such as the Gnostics and Essenes) also revered the goddess and the fe minine principle. She is, for instance, mentioned in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Additionally, it has recently been discovered that these sects and their writings go back to the earliest days of Egypt.

Despite the change in dogma, the Christian antipathy toward the feminine principle remained steadfast throughout the centuries. The persecution of w o men was part of the overall suppression of all pagan ways. It existed as part of the irrational denial of the human body and the Earth. Under Pope John XXII, in the year 1320 AD, the interrogation and persecution of so - called \"witches\" was made law. A witch was, of course, an adept. He or she was part of the \"W icca\" or \"W ise Ones.\" They were keepers of the arcane archive of knowle d ge passed down from the earliest times. Essentially, the W icca were, like the Stoics and Cathars, one of the groups preserving, as best they could, the Druidic Way . This is the reason why they were singled out by Rome and its agents. From the records of the black deeds toward the witches we get a glimpse into the hatred that brought utter ruin to the Druids and their creations. This fact must be kept ever in mind, when we read and review the destruction wro ught throughout the world by ministers of this most demonic and super - sadistic patristic religion. Technology disappeared as the Church became the most cohesive power in Western society. The extensive aqueducts and plumbing systems vanished.

The doctrine of selfhood was the number one gr eatest threat to the Roman Church. The perfect follower was the selfless man who despised his own existence, reviled his own body, feared the natural world, and cringed in obedience to a wrathful god who apparently regarded him as a despicable sinner worth y only of a life of servitude and pain. This bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts is not such as comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual and devilish - (James 3:14 - 15) The man who joins the army as a private does not wish to remai n a lowly pr i vate. He longs for the day when he is promoted to major, captain, or general. That is what he dreams of. His aspiration compels him to obey his superiors who make a point of treating him in a despicable manner. His superiors u n derstand his nat ure and know his fear will prevent him from standing out and speaking up. They demolish what remains of his self will and they do so with his consent. The man perishes and the general takes birth. So much for the success of brainwashing and regimentation. That this kind of inhuman beh a vior is common in the military is scandal enough. But of course it is not restri c ted to this milieu. Anti - human attitudes also exist within men of religion and politics. Religious dehumanization is the craftiest skill of the l ot.

If his pious mime act succeeds he feels certain of being promoted and given the positions of power he inwardly craves. His ultimate ps ychic satisfaction comes from the belief in redemption by proxy. That he d o es not need to deeply work on himself is the most subconsciously desired perk behind his religious allegiance. Along with a mass of others, equally hesitant to take responsibility f or their own lives, he is convinced that he is privileged and special because he has been chosen by a spiritually perfected superior being who will do all his spiritual work for him.

No such nonsense was taught by the Servants of Truth. No Druid spread such delusion and spiritual poison. The rites and telestic tests that ancient adepts passed through were rigorous in the extreme. The accounts from the Irish \"Fenian Cycle\" confirm this, as does a review of Bardic tr aditions. The adept under the guidance of the Druid or Shaman faced nature and knew full well that there was no entrance to the halls of his gods as long as he remained morally impure and sodden. He did as his living gods had done, and as his her o es and ch ieftains had done. The rigors of the Druidic or Shamanic W ay were preserved by the Native American Indians and the Aboriginal peoples of Aus t ralia, and for a while the idea of man working on himself to save himself was a seminal principle in early Christia nity, as it still is in modern Judaism.

The two examples that spring to mind are the W icca (W itches) and the Gnosti cs (groups such as the Cathars and Bogomils, etc). The Christian worshipper was to learn to loathe nature and r e pudiate his own body. The material world, and the physical reality, were of the devil, and was man's enemy. To be of god meant not being of this world. Ev e rything physical and sensual was to be doubted and degraded. Fear was insti l led in every heart and men were taught to regard themselves as inveterate sinners standing upon the brink of perdition. Only total obedience to the church ensured salvat ion. A man was not to pursue personal happiness or think of peace and comfort in this world. Man was put upon the Earth to suffer and offer everything he had as a sacrifice to god's church. The happy man, like the self - aware man, was an apostle of the devi l. The good Christian was a masochist, cruel to himself and suppressive to everyone he encountered. His was a follower of a necrophiliac religion of pain and fear that preferred death over life. What cries! what shrieks! what groans!. Who has imprisoned al l these woeful corpses?

The Druids were to be the evil and barbaric ones, sacrificing to their pan t heon of blood - lusting gods. The church had to rid the world of such an evil. It would take volumes to catalog the inhumanity of this Roman Church, and to illustrate its inherent corruption.

The gnosis, concerning the self, world, a nd cosmos, which the Irish had infused into the world, were corrupted and homogenized by the Atonists of Rome. W e can still glimpse some of the original tenets of Druidism in the wr i tings of the Stoics, Essenes, and Gnostics. The works of these sects came to light after the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Before their discovery, the world had not heard of the Gnostics. W e knew nothing of them or of their t e achings. And this was by design. The Essenes were considered heretics, as were the Gnostics. Popes raised armed forces against the latter and set about annihilating them from the face of the Earth. W e can glean from this suppre s sion what kind of treatment Druidism received. In some texts, the Essenes r e veal that their philosophy is of Druidic origin. Th ree Elders were served by twelve attendants. And this is certainly a tradition based on astrology. Essene masters were known as \"the Star\" and referred to themselves as \"Sons of Light\" or as \"the Elect.\" Their writings show us that they understood, like th e Irish priests, that enlightenment meant self - discovery , psychic hygiene, and ultimately dispensing with mediators. Nothing was to block the idea that enlightenment was in a man's own keeping. It was not, and is not, something i m posed or apprehended from outside.

He did not transgress the individuality of any living man or woman and did not offer p romises and lures in order to subjugate the will of the free. He taught men to know themselves so they could know nature and all else. He taught a man to obey the laws of the universe so he could be taught by that order. He understood that the creation wa s ever evolving, ever changing, ever renewing. It was not a static thing to be hated and condemned. Every single particle of the world was a teacher. Everything that existed, whether animate or inanimate, had a lesson to teach the receptive, awakened, and healthy mind. And everything that existed was to be reverenced as divine. God was in everything , and god was every w here . There was no place that god was not.

As we have said, it is futile to expect complete understanding from those historians myopic enough to beli e ve that the Mesolithic and Neolithic period constituted the first bone f ide stages of human cultural development. Comyns Beaumont was a man endowed with the main ingredient for genius; the independent mind. He was unfettered by academic affiliation and unblink e red by conventional attitudes, and he possessed a scintillating vis ion of the past. From the outset of his remarkable studies Beaumont understood that the history of civilization, particularly in the British Isles, receded further in time than most official sources state. Taking over from the great American scholar and al ternative historian Ignatius Donnelly (1831 - 1901), Beaumont began to reconstruct the histories of Ireland, Britain, and Europe, without forgetting for an instant that these relatively small landmasses had survived several incomprehensibly violent assaults from nature that ruined the great civilizations once existing there. His work pre - dated that of the great Immanuel Velikovsky (1895 - 1976), and followed on from Anna W ilkes and Conor MacDari, who had both independently considered Britain and Ireland to be r epositories of \"Atlantean\" or \"H y perborean\" traditions.

This \"Atlantean\" area was known to the ancients as Hyperborea (meaning \"Beyond North\") or as Ultima Tule , Tula , and Tollan, and also as Arktos or Atzlan . In the fields of archaeology, geology, and astronomy the last few years have brought a vast array of facts to corrobor ate the claims that there were physical upheavals of a global character in historical times; that these catastrophes were caused by extraterrestrial agents; and that the nature of these agents may be identified. The memory of the cataclysms was erased, not because of lack of written traditions, but because of some characteristic process that later caused entire nations, together with their literate men, to read into these traditions allegories or m e taphors where actually cosmic disturbances were clearly des cribed - Immanuel Velikovsky Western coast of Scotland, with the Irish Sea between.

It was these tragic terrestrial upheavals that sent forth exceptionally gifted and learned W estern men into the farthest reaches of the South and East. The appearance of these strangers in nations of the East was a sing u larly conspicuous occurrence. It was considered a most auspicious event by the natives of Eastern climes whose lives were benefited by the influence of the visitors.

These W estward migrations of related and unrelated contingen ts (of Scythians, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Goidelic, Bryth o nic, and Belgae Celts, Picts, Caledonians, and Trojans, etc) occurred over g e nerations and are erroneously believed to have been responsible for origin a ting occidental symbolism, theology, music, po etry, and other customs and idioms. These subsequent migrations did have a significant cultural effect, but they were not responsible for civilizing the people of W estern Europe or Br i tain.

The site in North - W estern Pakistan, known as Mohanjo D a ro, discovered along the banks of the Sindhu River in 1922, was one of over 2,500 settlements in the Indus Valley region.

It is the reason why most people will never hear of the Indus Valley civilizations. These communities, of many mixed tribal units, appear to have thrived due to the existence of the great Saraswati river that now, by way of satellite imaging, are known to have flowed through the area. Th e various settlements at Mohanjo Daro and Harappa were not constructed by Indo - Aryan \"invaders\" but by Indo - European tribes who had been resident in the region for millennia.

The imperialist and Christian propagand ists succeeded in disseminating the fallacious notion that the Dravidian natives of India had a insignificant role in the cultural affairs of their own country and, most importantly, that the Arya were invaders from outside. Their theory of ruthless but so phisticated invaders from elsewhere, who butchered and oppressed their primitive underlings, appealed to the Imperialist mindset of many race obsessed Victorian and Edwardian men, and was sufficiently embellished to sound plausible. It was designed to prev ent men from finding out that the Arya were not a race but a spiritual elect, and that Indo - Europeans from Eurasia (Sumeria, Babylon, Chaldea, Egypt) and also from further west (Turkey, Scythia, Germany, Scandinavia, Britain, and Ir e land) had long been wel come traders, teachers, guests, and settlers in Northern India and Pakistan. This fact is confirmed by regional names. Districts and mountain ranges, such as Aral , Syr Darya and Amu Darya , still contain the syllables ( Ari and Dar ) connoting the Druid Elder s whose gods inhabited the high places. The commerce and intercourse between the West and the Indus Valley was aided by the existence of the so - called \"Silk Roads,\" or trade routes that explorer Marco Polo would traverse in later times. The biblical river Gihon, that allegedly watered the Garden of Eden, was apparently based on the ancient river Jayhoun that flowed down from Amu Darya, one of the highest ranges in the world. The Indus Valley civilization depended upon the rivers that ran through the r e gion , the Sindh, Ravi, Ganges, and particularly the great Saraswati. However, variations in ecology brought drastic changes to threaten the stability of local communities. These variations were probably the consequences of the vast worldwide cataclysm that had occurred a short time previously. In any case, the civilization situated in the Indus Valley appears to have terminated, like so many others, due to aridity, although the presence of many radioactive cor p ses (as well as melted walls, structures, and peopl e) suggests other causes. Around 1900 BC, the Saraswati, that had once flowed down from the Himal a ya Mountains, dwindled and dried to such an extent that the people in the m a ny towns along its banks were forced to abandon their homes. The Rig Veda, that cl early mentions the expanse of the Saraswati must, therefore, have been composed a long time before the period of aridity. Mention of the full flowing Saraswati dates the Indo - Aryan Rig Veda to over 3,500 years old.

During the '90s evidence was discovered that proved Comyns Beaumont and the Catastrophists correct. In their books When the Earth Nearly Died and Cataclysm , senior scientists D. S. Allan and J. B. Delair provide the evidence that decimates the conventional \"Ice Age\" theory that had long been refuted by Beaumont a nd the Catastrophists. Crit i cally, the discoveries of Allan and Delair undermine the geological theories for the existence of the two million year long so - called \"Pleistocene Epoch,\" m e ant to have housed the spurious Ice Age. They show that the upheavals t hat devastated the world of old were caused not by extended periods of ice action but by vulcanism, water torrent, and by the super - heating and subsequent r a pid cooling of the atmosphere. All these effects, plus hurricanes and tsunamis, were caused approxi mately 11,000 years ago by the entrance into the solar system of the comet Phaeton. As Dr. Velikovsky had done during the 1950s and '60s, Allan and Delair reviewed the world myths that recorded the frightful devastation which wrecked the world. On the Ice Age, they write: ...no satisfactory theory has yet been proposed that actually explains what caused the ̳Ice Age‘ in the first place. There appear to be no terrestrial conditions, as we know them, capable of producing the heat necessary to evaporate vast qua ntities of water to form continental - sized ice - sheets - ( When the Earth Nearly Died ) Heat from erupting volcanoes, followed by rapid cooling, caused the ice action which was once thought to have occurred from millennia long freezes. Spe a king of this phenom enon, and of the mortality caused by violent winds, the authors write: ...even if they existed, the huge ice - sheets of Pleistocene times needed great heat for their formation, an element conceivably provided by many volcanoes erupting simult a neously. Such an event, if it actually occurred, must also have generated tremendous atmospheric pollution and hurricane force winds...The frightful hurricanes...were dou b tless primary factors in the demise of so much insect and bird life...for what other agency other than ex tremely violent winds could have brought together in one place such dissimilar avian species Outstanding and revolutionary as the revelations of these scientists are, they merely confirm the theories of Comyns Beaumont whose refutations of the \"Uniformitar ian\" credo of James Geikie, Charles Lyell, and Louis Agassiz (and others of their school) were completely ignored.

In the tradition of Beaumont and Velikovsky they review the extinction events that appear to h a ve occurred over twelve millennia BC and that are also recorded in the world's myths and legends. ...the demise of mammoths and other animals was not caused by the onset of glacial conditions, as many authorities would have us believe, for the evidence shows that they were, in most cases, already dead before they were frozen. Therefore, instead of a slow gradual freeze and building up of glacial conditions over a prolonged period, as is generally proposed, refrigeration was remarkably sudden and unrelenting.

On the polar shift phen o menon, Allan and Delair write: Studies have shown that at 10,178 BC, or over 12,000 years ago, the Celestial Pole was inclined at an angl e of 30 degrees from its present position. This in turn strongly su g gests that the terrestrial axis then oriented differently from today Taking these findings into consideration we realize, not only that Beaumont and the Catastrophists had come closest to the truth concerning the fossil r e cord and past geological phenomena, and that a worldwide cataclysm most certainly did occur, but that \"historical\" civilizations first arose as remnants of older ones obliterated by these terrible upheavals.

Thompson ( The Mythic Past, Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) Professor Thompson addresses the writings of Josephus Piso, who is ludi c rously taken for one of the great authorities on Jewish history: One of the most striking and wonderful things about an \"historian\" like Josephus is that he knows almost nothing about \"the past\" that we ourselves do not already know from other sources. When an account he gives of a supposed event of two centuries earlier \"confirms\" something we can read in other works, it is only because he has c o pied or paraphrased it. Josephus has been well des cribed as a person one wouldn't buy a used car from - ( The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) Duplicitous and ignorant \"historians\" of later ages, like Josephus and Herod o tus (and many others), took accounts of early migrations and e xoduses, those undertaken by W esterners, and deliberately fused them with later events. They have deliberately re - scripted events known to have occurred in the occ i dent and have made them appear to have occurred in the East. Beaumont f o cused his energies l argely on rectifying this quandary in order to show which of the many events, recorded in Egyptian, Jewish, and oriental histories, act u ally took place in Scandinavia and British Isles. He implicates the Greeks and Romans, and Judeo - Christian intelligentsi a, for the deliberate historical obsc u ration and distortion. He accuses Constantine the Great in particular: As far as the Bible geography is concerned it appears that the main person responsible for its misinterpretation was Constantine the Great, who had definite motives for tran s ferring the arena of Jewish history and that of Christ to another region altogether. He used Christianity as a valuable political asset, selected the East as his Empire, and with the aid of Eusebius, Jerome and others, invented t he present Palestine...If this be co r rect the present day Jews, who make a historical claim to Palestine are utterly wide of the mark - ibid"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"...Megiddo, Gezer and Hazor and Jerusalem were in reality more like villages...with small public buildings and poorly c onstructed dwellings with clay floors.

Being disaffected by the initial nat u ral onslaught, and then by pestil ence and disease, the numbers of the Elder Race dwindled. As the Northern races emigrated from their natural habitat they swarmed Southward and divided into small groups. The groups that m a naged to survive would inevitably have settled in foreign parts and gradually lost their racial uniqueness. They would eventually have assimilated into those tribes and nations that outnumbered them. If any were to return home in future ages it would have been descendants with blood mixed through interbreeding. W hat retur ned was never a pure stock. Those resettling ancestral homelands might not even recognize as their own the scant and faded remnants of civil i zation found amid the hills and valleys that had once been the sacred home of their fathers. Earlier we mentioned t he W estward journey of Pharaoh Menes, King of Egypt and son of Sargon the Phoenician. The fact that king Menes decided to travel to Ireland, and that the Milesians (Atonists) of Egypt also regarded the We s tern Isles as sacred locales, reminds us of the Egy ptian tradition concerning Amenta , or the \"Underworld,\" through which the souls of the \"dead\" must pass to face their judgment. The word Amenta referred to the land of Amen, or Amun Ra. Beaumont had no trouble understanding why the Egyptians beli e ved Ament a to be situated in the farthest W estern hemisphere. He had no problem understanding why Hathor, the extremely ancient mother goddess, whose name meant \"House of Horus the Sun,\" was considered goddess of the W est. Amenta was connected with the dead because the ancestors of the Egyptians had emigrated from \"motherlands\" devastated or \"killed\" by fire, wind, and ice. A return to these dark torn lands, either dramatically in ritual, or physically, meant a return to the lands of death. Significantly, Hathor's o ther name, Mehturt, meant \"from the great flooding waters.\" W e do not take this to mean the Nile and its inundation. W e take it to"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"mean the destructive torrential floods of the North - W estern hemisphere. After all, since the goddess of the W est's second nam e signified flooding waters, it follows logically that these were in the West . W e take it that Amenta, the Duat, the Nekyia, Sheol, Hades, Hell, Eliudnir, Ginnungagap, Niflheim, Limbo, Tartarus, Gehenna, Xiblaba, Avernus, the Abyss, Annwn, etc, through whi ch Osiris, Horus, Odin, Ody s seus, Tiresias, Perseus, and so many mutilated or dismembered heroes were to traverse, were in fact poetic and mythographic renditions pertaining to the British Isles and Scandinavia, and to the incomprehensible reign of havoc t hat befell the spiritually advanced and technically endowed inhabitants of those regions who experienced both a living Hell and Purgatory on their very own lands. The cold people - less wastes, occupied by strange creatures, stinking of death, and ruined bey ond recognition, became the prototypes for hell. The e x planation is absolutely logical and sound. It is clear that in very primitive ages the cultured nations of the Mediterranean regarded our islands with peculiar reverence and fear. The entrance to Hades lay in these seas, and here apparently Charon ferried the departed souls across the River of Death. The curious basaltic columns of Ulster and the Western Isles, and the awe - inspiring portals of Fingal's Cave, probably had something to do with these extra ordinary notions, but it is certain that such stories were common gossip in the time of Homer - A. W. Whatmore ( Insulae Britainnicae ) The Tuat was a - region of death and destruction, a place where the dead rotted and decayed, a place of abomination, horro r, terror, and annihilation - E. A. Wallis Budge In his book The Riddle of Prehistoric Britain, Comyns Beaumont brilliantly demonstrates how the Greek Hades can be topographically reconstructed to fit the W estern Highlands of Scotland. He addresses the man y customs and rituals performed by nations and tribes after the Age of Catastrophe. Many legends, he asserts, preserve the lineaments of the original human tragedy, and obliquely refer to the trauma suffered to the human mind from witnessing the wreckage a nd carnage of a world torn asunder by colossal natural forces. The unleashing of such titanic forces was seen by early man as retribution by angered gods. Post - diluvian man lived with a great feeling of guilt as a result of what had transpired. His own psy che was, like the world around him, drastically changed. Man was hardened and guilt - ridden. His worship of gods became more ardent and fear - based. The gods of the Raising of the Djed, also known as the Tat, or Pillar of Thoth. This solemn and vital rite symbolized the return of order and stability. It represented the resurrection of Osiris the god of the earth. The"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Underworld were particularly revered. One good example of what Beaumont relayed concerning my thology involves the story of Osiris. Osiris, considered by Egyptologists to be a god of the Earth, actually represented the Earth itself. He was the Earth. This is why we read that his ordeal involved a conflict with Set, the god of wastelands, and why we read of his dismemberment . W hy this particular kind of death? Beaumont saw it as a device commemorating the tearing to pieces of the Earth by forces unleashed by comet Phaeton. The story of the god or hero torn apart, with his body parts scattered over al l parts of the land, served as a retelling of actual terrestrial events. The resurrection of the hero involved the methodical piecing together of the body parts. This trope represents the parts of the Earth emerging again from receding waters and retractin g or melting ice sheets. The Egyptians had preserved the entire saga of destruction followed by renewal in their earliest cosmological motifs, particularly those of the Pr i mordial Mound and conflict between Osiris, Horus, and Set. erecting of obelisks and towers represented restored order and new life for the Earth. The tower was the Earth's phallus. Its erection symbolized hope and life. The symbolism also extended to the phenomenon of Earth's Polar Shift. Objects are straightened or set in place again once they have fallen or been toppled. To understa nd this kind of solemn rite, and to fathom the m o dus operendi of Druidism we must comprehend the severity of the Age of Catastrophe that so ravaged the planet Of all places in the British Isles, it was the Shetland and Orkney Islands North - East of Scotl and that held a special fascination for Beaumont. Ancient hist o rians claimed that Noah had come from the \"Land of Seth\" before the deluge. Beaumont believed that this was a reference to the Shetlands that are, with the Orkneys, the oldest landmasses on Ea rth. These islands were a remnant of the great pre - diluvian civilizations. The name Orkney (Gaelic Orcads ) was, as Anna W ilkes pointed out in 1873, the original Accad erroneously believed to have been situated in Northern Mesopotamia. Orcads is also the or igin of the Greek Arcadia . This word Arcadia, that contains the syllable Arc meaning \"bear,\" therefore, referred to the Northern stars and the Northern climes. Arcadia, or Akkadia, meant \"the holy place.\" These terms referred to the Orkney Islands of Scotl and that housed astronomical Druidic cults so "},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"expert in the o r dinances of the heavens. The oldest geological sites housed the oldest archives of human knowledge. Ancient historians claimed that Noah had come from the \"Land of Seth\" before the deluge. Beaum ont believed that this was a reference to the Shetlands. He argued that the civilizations once existent on the Shetlands far predated those of the Aegean, like the Minoan, touted by archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans to be the motherland of civilization. Beaum ont refutes the co n jectures of Evans and his followers, emphasizing the relative dearth of Megalithic artifacts on the island. There is nothing of the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age at all, quite incredible were it the island where mankind had trad i tionally first evolved civilization - ( Britain: The Key to World History ) Scotland, the Orkneys, and the Shetlands, were the original motherlands of civilization, said Beaumont. Upon these landmasses exists the evidence purposely overlooked by the archaeologists, a nthropologists, and historians desperate for personal glory and apparently obsessed with centering the cradle of culture in Eastern climes. Given what scholars, such as Ignatius Donnelly, Conor MacDari, and Comyns Beaumont have related, and given what obje ctive study reveals, we conclude that the biblical Philistines, Amorites, Arm e nians, Thracians, Minoans, and Phoenicians, as well as many other tribes, had their origins in the lands of the North - W est. One of the oldest recorded names for Egypt was Ogy gia . According to Comyns Beaumont this name derived from the Irish Ogma who was god of the alphabet, and of speech. He was the prototype for Hermes, Mercury, and Thoth. The early Irish alphabetic script is known as the Ogham. A secondary definition for Ogy gia, defined \"men from the wooded isles.\" The only way this could serve as a description for Egyptians is if they had orig i nated from forested regions. ...from this ancient center of the earlier world, bearing copious witness of habitation from the Early Paleolithic Age onward, flourished the Cretans or Sethites, all racially Pelasgi or Phoenicians or Chaldeans, Cimmerians or Hyperboreans Beaumont claimed that many of the events, places, and characters mentioned in the Old Testament, refer to events, place s, and characters, in and of the Br i tish Isles. After detailed and thorough investigations of every island, headland, estuary, river, Megalithic site, petroglyph, city, and town of England, Ireland, Scotland, and W ales, after similar investigations in Euro pe and Asia, and after a thorough analysis of Homer, Hesiod, and the Greek mythographers and hi s torians, Beaumont was convinced that pre - and post - diluvian men from the British Isles were the original authors, broadcasters, and inspirers of the"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"many tales that appeared later, in adulterated form, in the mythological archive and in the bible's fragmentary convoluted accounts. In any reconstruction in Scotland of early Greek sites of the regions which came to be named Hellas, the connection between Parnassus and that somber, red, mist - laden, solitary mountain in the midst of Argyll, named Ben Cruachan, is unavoidable.

Their ark was named Nwydd Nav Neivion, and took with it a male and female of all living things.

Thompson, Beaumont understood that Palestine and Jud ea were geographic locations quite incapable of providing sustenance for the type of advanced and literate civilizations reputedly referenced in the bible. The fertile lands of Britain, on the other hand, were quite capable of it. The rich cornucopia of th e bible could certai n ly have originated from people who hailed from these ancient civilizations. Arthur's Seat, above the city of Edinburgh, Bea u mont's original Jerusalem The names of places and people may have been changed, but Beaumont i n sisted that behind the travesties one could still detect the essential facts. Like migrating architectural or musical tropes, or like exotic spices and delicacies couriered by merchants, the stories and accounts found in the bible, put there by Roman hands, were stor ies that had been transplanted from elsewhere, to be precise, from Britain and Scandinavia. An excellent example of what Beaumont meant involves the Scottish city of Edinburgh.

In both good times and bad, Meg a lithi c travelers from Britain crossed the land bridge between Scandinavia and England. The ancient inhabitants of Britain knew that lands still existed in the East after the great cataclysm. To these Southern and Eastern lands they r e luctantly went, taking with them their rich customs and religious rites, their technology, beliefs, language, music, and symbolism. Because these trave r sals took place before the official dates posited for the rise of the world's major civilizations, they have been deliberately igno red. But evidence is now coming out showing that Egypt was colonized by W estern people over 15,000 years ago. W all paintings, dating from this remote period, have recently been found in Southern Egypt bearing a striking resemblance to those found at the ca ves of Lascaux in France. As Comyns Beaumont had shown, this artwork was Nordic in origin. It belongs to those travelers from the North - W est who desp e rately sought refuge from the cataclysm that had made their own homelands uninhabitable. The races of Egyp t, Libya, and India, etc, knew these strange visitors as \"Red Men,\" \"Men of Gold,\" \"Goat Men,\" and \"Stag Men,\" etc. In the bible they are cryptically referred to as \"Edomites.\" This name, attributed to the early Egyptians, simply meant \"Red Men.\" This term has never been satisfa c torily explained. However, the original Egyptians are described as having fair hair, and as being of red complexion . The redness mentioned is merely su n burn. Red is what a Caucasian man's skin turns in equatorial heat. Another featu re to be observed of the Giants is that nearly always they are described as red - haired, as were the Adamites and Edomites, names derived from the Hebrew adom or edom, red or ruddy...The same applies to the Phoenicians of like stock, whose name is but a der ivation of the word meaning red or carroty, relating to a ruddy - faced people, and much the same applies to the Ethiopians, meaning bronzed or reddish - hued, who in the Old Testament are named Cush and Chasdim...We should clear our minds at o n ce from the arc haism that the legendary Ethiopians were a black - skinned, fuzzy - haired, negroid people of Africa...Their name...is derived from words signifying burnt, sun burnt, red, fiery, like the word Phoenician, the men or ruddy hue, bronzed skin, and red hair - Comy ns Beaumont ( The Riddle of Prehistoric Britain) Africa, indeed, was only assumed to be the land named Libya at a somewhat late date when the ancient locations had been thrown out of focus...Josephus describes \"Lib y os\" as a \"son\" or dependency of Mizraim... and Plato's Atlantis is described as larger than \"Asia\" and \"Libya\" together, thus making Libya no great continental stretch of land. There is a suggestion that it may have been one of the early names of Ireland. Vi l lanueva, in his Phoenician Ireland, clai ms that Phut, its Old Testament name, translated as Libya, was the original name of Ireland and signified the \"Green\" or \"Emerald\" Isle. Avienus, also, when speaking of the \"girdle of Earth,\" appears to have Ireland in mind as Libya in the following passag e in a description of the seas coming down from the Hyperborean Ocean or Saturn's Sea\" - \"Thus the Ocean, unique and immense, girdle of the earth, surrounds the universe with its wandering waves, which, descending from the Northern sea towards its coasts, hollows out numerous gulfs...it stretches far and bears its waves to a strait dividing Hersperii and Libya\" - Comyns Beaumont"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Given that the prefixed letter \"L\" serves as \"The\" (as it still does in French), Libya would have been L' Ibya (pronounced \"Ib - ee - a\").

It is singular to find a white race spoken of in the ancient monuments. Dr. Brugsch, the learned German, notices the word Tam - hou or white men.

Druidic Symbolism in Masonry & Judeo - Christianity From all these facts it appears that the population of Ireland came from the West, and not from Asia - that it was one of the many waves of population flowing out from the Island of Atlan tis - and herein we find the explanation of that problem which has puzzled the Aryan scholars. As Ireland is farther from the Punjab than Persia, Greece, R o me, or Scandinavia, it would follow that the Celtic wave of migration must have been the earliest se nt out from the Sanskrit centre; but it is now asserted by Professor Schleicher and others that the Celtic tongue shows that it separated from the Sanskrit original tongue later than the others, and that it is more closely allied to the Latin than any othe r Aryan tongue. This is entirely inexplicable upon any theory of an Eastern or i gin of the Indo - European races, but very easily understood if we recognize the Aryan and Celtic migrations as going out about the same time from the Atlantean fountain - head. The re are many points confirmatory of this belief. In the first place, the civilization of the Irish dates back to a vast antiquity - Ignatius Donnelly ( Atlantis: The Ante - Diluvian Epoch, 1882) As we have shown throughout the Irish Origins of Civilization, th e symbols and traditions we associate with Judaism, Christianity, Templarism, and Masonry, originate in Ireland .

Long before the first official dynasties, over 4,000 years ago, the W estern Arya migrated to the Middle and Far East, establishing new civilizations and enriching existing ones. Their rema ins have been discovered in Upper Egypt and at locations farther East. They were the original architects of the Giza Pyramids and the many sacred temples along the Nile. They brought with them the worship of Amen Ra, Osiris, Horus, and Isis. W hile in the E ast, the Arya referred to their own W estern habitats as \"lands of the dead,\" due to the colossal devastation that had occurred there. The many prehistoric and historic migrations to the British Isles (of Iberians, Celts, Gaels, and so on) were for the m ost part returns . During the so - called \"Age of Catastrophe,\" titanic cataclysms displaced the original inhabitants of Britain, who were forced to flee to the Continent across land - bridges now lost beneath the waves. The Druids were Aryans. This word has been deliberately misinterpreted to signify members of a race. However, the term truly refers to a spiritual caste, an elect. It is also the true name of Ireland, correctly rendered Ariland , or \"Land of the Arya.\" The term can also be correctly rendered E ri , signifying the Earth goddess of the ancient Druids. Etymologically, Ari and Eri can be found as roots in terms and names such as area, terra, Tara, Mary , Hera , Benares , Armenia , Aramaic , and aristocracy , etc. The language of the Arya is now referred to as Aramaic and Hebrew. However, these languages have been fraudulently put before us by linguists and \"experts.\" They are not \"Semitic\" and were not invented by early Jews or Canaanites. The twenty two letters of the Hebrew alphabet are based on the an cient Irish alphabet. (The names of each of the twelve tribes of Israel are Gaelic.) Additionally, the so - called \"Hebrew\" alphabet was the sacred alphabet of the initiates. It was the non - hieroglyphic script of the Egyptian adepts. It was the alphabet of t he Ibaru who were not the religious Jews known today. They were the Judites, Judges, and W ise Ones, the architects of high civilizations eventually brought low by desecrators who appropriated, corrupted, and misrepresented their sacred tropes. (The shapes of the twenty two \"Hebrew\" letters were, in fact, based on the serpentine shadows cast by sunlight passing through the, now lost, crystalline capstone on top of the Great Pyramid of Giza. These \"letters\" were assigned to the twenty two cards of the Tarot, which originated in Ireland, and were also"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"assigned to the twenty two \"paths\" on the Kabalistic \"Tree of Life.\" The concept of the sacred tree was known to W estern adepts - British, Nordic, and European - millennia before the rise of Judaism and Christiani ty.) Terms such as Israel, Israelite, Jew, Judite, Yahud, Jehovah, Adonai, Aton, Amen, Elohim, Christ, Jesus, Messiah, Joshua, Isaac, David, Solomon, and so on, were originally Druidic or Aryan denotations. They were not names but titles denoting member s of Druidic colleges. These terms were plagiarized and deliberately mistranslated to obscure the facts about the origins of religion. Judeo - Christianity is an adulterated form of Druidism and Amenism. The vast majority of tenets, doctrines, terms, and symbols, of modern religion are the result of plagiarism. They are based on ancient Aryan theology and astro - theology. The adulterated form of Druidism and Amenism can also be referred to as Atonism. Atonism is the basis for the monotheistic elements o f Judeo - Christian theology. In other words, Christianity was not conceived by egalitarian Jews or Essenes, Mandeans, Stoics, Therapeuts, or Alexandrian Gnostics, as some scholars contend. Most of these sects were branches of ancient Atonism . The same can b e said of Mithraism and Talmudism. The Jewish Jehovah is none other than Adon or Aton, god of light. The emperors who codified and established Christianity were members of Solar Cults that were outer cells of a more secretive Atonist lodge. Members of t he Flavian dynasty of Rome worked closely with leading \"Jews\" (Atonists) to establish the Christian religion. They feared the rise of other religions with egalitarian tenets and \"Druidic\" elements. To suppress rivals and galvanize imperial dominion, they f unded duplicitous scribes and compilers (such as Paul and Marcion) to create Christianity, basing their \"Jesus Christ\" on many ancient solar heroes and deities. The astro - theological motifs found throughout the scriptures prove this beyond all doubt. Never theless, the God of the Bible, Jehovah, was not the God of the Jews, as most academic historians falsely allege. He was the God of the Solar Cult priests and pharaohs. The so - called \"Jews\" who worked alongside the Roman nobility, and who directed their operations, were Atonists. Specifically, they were the leaders of the Order of Melchizedek (Akhenaton). They were Pharisees and Sadducees of elevated rank, keepers of the so - called \"Oral Tradition\" allegedly delivered to their ancestors at Mount Sinai.

They are esoteric terms that refer to a caste of adepts descended from ancient Solar Cults. This fact is known to the members of Masonic Orders and other Judaic enclaves. The members of the British royal family, for examp le, are Judites, even though they belong to the Protestant religion. The Pope is a Judite, and so are his bishops and cardinals, even though they belong to the Catholic religion. To elites, religious affiliations mean little, and are merely a form of camou flage. They serve to dupe the uninformed masses of the world. The word Tudor derives from Juda or Judah, as do the terms judge, tutor and Teuton . The founder of Atonism was Pharaoh Akhenaton (Amenhotep IV). He appears in the Old Testament and Jewish his tory as Moses. He was not an enlightener, as ninety eight percent of the world's writers and historians apparently imagine. He was a megalomaniac who ravaged Egypt and violently destroyed its many marvels. He was finally forced from power and expelled from the country. The rise of his monotheistic beliefs and warped brand of solar theology coincided with an important astrological phenomenon, namely, the precessional transition of the sun into the house of Aries. Akhenaton's Atonists were members of the H yksos dynasty of kings and princes. However, in our estimation, these controversial kings were descendents of Scythian Gaels. In other words, they were of W estern ancestry. Although they were originally affiliated with the Megalithic Arya, they later becam e spiritually and morally corrupt. The modern - day revisionists Ralph Ellis, Moustafa Gadalla, and Ahmed Osman (following on from Comyns Beaumont and others) conclude that the so - called \"Israelites\" and \"Judites\" of the Old Testament were none other than the Hyksos - Atonists, first expelled from Egypt at the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty and again during the reign of Akhenaton.

Our work is dedicated utterly to the exposure of these psychopathic plutocrats and the ruin of their anti - human industry. The coming of the Atonists was recorded by Irish and Scottish annalists. The records refer to the invaders as Milesians, after their leader King Mile. (He is known to the Scots as Gathelos or Gaythelos, which is probably were we derive the term \"Gael,\" meaning \"stranger.\") Officially, the Milesians are believed to have crossed over to Ireland from Spain around 600 BC. However, we believe these dates have been deliberately falsified. The Atonist invasion probably occurred nearly one thousand years before the official dates given. The falsification oc curred because historians have been directed to date the Gaelic invasion of Ireland, suppression of the Druids, and creation of Christianity, to the period following the rise of Rome (700 BC), and not before. As we said, the ancestors of the Milesians (the Scythians) were originally Irish. They had been displaced to Europe and the Middle East after experiencing the havoc of the Age of Catastrophe. Eradicating the Druids proved to be a difficult task for the Milesian - Atonists. They eventually called on th eir agents in Rome to lend a hand. In our opinion, the imperialist activities of Alexander the Great, Julius and Augustus Caesar, and other Greek and Roman tyrants, were mercenary actions, funded and directed by high - ranking Atonists ensconced in Britain. This same British - based cabal also financed the establishment of the Christian Church in Byzantium (Constantinople) and finally Rome. Christianity was hybridized Druidism. It was to usurp and occupy the place of the unadulterated school, once known and res pected throughout the world. Furthermore, Irish Culdean (or Atonist) monks (those in charge of cannibalizing Druidic tropes) became tutors of the Templar nobility of Britain and Europe.

It is also found in Switzerland - e. g., Minno - dunum (Moudon) Eburo - dunum (Yverdon) - and in the Netherlands, where the famous city of Leyden goes back to a Celtic Lug - dunum. In Great Britain the Celtic term was often changed by simple translation into castra ; thus Camulo - dunum became Colches ter, Bran - dunum Brancaster. In Spain and Portugal eight names terminating in dunum are mentioned by classical writers. In Germany the modern names Kempton, Karnberg, Liegnitz, go back respectively to the Celtic forms Cambo - dunum, Carro - aunum, Lugi - dunum, a nd we find a Singi - dunum, now Belgrade, in Ser b ia, a Novi - dunum, now Isaktscha, in Roumania, a Carro - dunum in South Russia, near the Dniester, and another in Croatia, now Pitsmeza. Sego - dunum, now Rodez, in France, turns up also in Bavaria (Wurzburg), and in England (Sege - dunum, now Wallsend, in Northumberland), and the first term, sego, is traceable in Segorbe ( Sego - briga ), in Spain. Briga is a Celtic word, the origin of the German burg, and equivalent in meaning to dunum... One more example: the word magos , a plain, which is very frequent as an element of Irish place - names, is found abundantly in France, and outside of France, in countries no longer Celtic, it appears in Switzerland (Uro - magus, now Promasens), in the Rhineland (Broco - magus, Brumath), in the Netherlands, as already noted (Nimègue), in Lombardy several times, and in Austria - ( Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race, 1911) For more information on the this subject, refer to Chapter Fourteen of Volume One, entitled: The Lost Language of the Ancient s.

These Hyksos have recen tly been related to the Israelites of the Bible. If our Scythian - Hyksos connection is correct, then we have, from the annals, strong confirmation of the West to East transit of the elements of civilization. Furthermore, we can offer a more logical explanat ion for the word \"Saxon,\" and for why some researchers believe Saxons and Israelites to have been one and the same group. Some investigators believe the word Saxon to be a derivation of Saca (or Saka , Sakai, or Saga ) denoting \"Scythian.\" Allegedly, this word gives us the name Isaac or, more properly Ish Sac , meaning \"Man of the Saca.\" According to the Bible, Isaac was the son of Abraham who was, along with his wife Sarah, the first \"Israelite\" to enter the land of Egypt. The name Isaac indicates that Abr aham and his descendants were Scythians. W e think this to be very likely, although we suggest caution when consulting the official accounts concerning this prophet and his spurious emigration.

And we can be sure that other settlemen ts existed in the region, as well as in the Nile Delta area. Therefore, since the Scythians and so - called \"Israelites\" (the Hyksos of Egypt) were so intimately connected, it is quite correct to refer to Saxons of the W estern lands as \"Israelites,\" although not for the reasons given by orthodox Jews, Christians, and British - Israelites who generally believe the Israelites to have been a ragged but god - inspired underclass cruelly oppressed by despotic Egyptian slave masters. That supposition is unsupported by the facts, and has now been openly refuted by leading Jewish historians. It was an unsustainable concoction from start to finish.

She was the daughter of Akhenaton and Nefertiti, and had the nickname Scota. This name derives from Scuti or Scut, the name by which the Scythians were originally known. After the Milesian - Atonist invasion, Ireland was given the name Scota. Later, the Irish took their Princess's name to S cotland (\"Land of Scota,\" or \"Land of the Scots (or Scythians\"). The Scythian - Hyksos - Atonists were none other than the \"Israelites\" and \"Judites\" of the Old Testament. Click here for more i nfo. A study of their symbolism leaves us in no doubt of this.

Their own history claims this to be the case. Their physique, physiognomy, bearing and general temperament is certainly akin to that of ancient Vikings and Goths, that is, of Nordics. The very name Sikh may derive from Sac or Sakh, denoting the Scythians. Together with these primeval Aryan Atlantic memories appear those cult allegories, costumes, carvings which are understandable only in terms of Nordic origin. In predynastic Egypt, we find the Nordic boat w ith its swan neck and trefoil. But the rowers are the later ruling Amorites, already recognized by Sayce as fair skinned and blue eyed. They once traversed north Africa as strictly homogeneous hunter clans which gradually subdued the entire land. They then migrated somewhat further, across Syria and toward the future site of Babylon.

Although the following quoted researcher, like so many others, erroneously imagines the migrations to have be from the e astern to the western hemisphere, his analysis in other respects is most insightful. It reveals the facts that have been kept from us for centuries by complicit historians who would rather we not know the truth about the origin, nature, and movement of the ancient races of the world: In a rather bold paragraph in their recent book on The Tarim Mummies, James P. Mallory and Victor H. Mair suggest that there may have been more cohesion among these nomads than was previously believed. They wrote in the followi ng paragraph regarding the Yuezhi nomads near the border of China: Da (Greater) Yuezhi or in the earlier pronunciation d'ad - ngiwat - tieg, has been seen to equate with the Massagetae who occupied the oases and steppelands of West Central Asia in the time of Herodotus; here Massa renders an Iranian word for \"Great,\" hence \"Great Getae.\" ...Others have seen in this word an attempt to capture in Chinese the name of a tribe that is rendered in Greek as the Iatioi who are recorded in Ptolemy's geography. The origi nal pronunciation has been reconstructed as gwat - ti or got - ti or gut - si, which opens up distant lexical similarities with the Goths (the German tribes of northern and eastern Europe), the Getae (the Dacian, i.e., Balkan, tribes northwest of the Black Sea), the Guti (a people on the borderlands of Mesopotamia), the Kusha (our Kushans), the Gushi (a people mentioned in Han texts and regarded as brigands along with the peoples of Kroran), or a combination of some but not all of the above (Mallory and Mair 2000 , 98 - 99). ...comparison of like - sounding tribal names, although merely a paragraph in length, could potentially generate volumes of discussion and can help us understand more definitively the nature of the barbarian invasions in ancient Rome, the powerful Kushan Empire in India, the possible origins of the Guti people, the Guti kings of Mesopotamia, and the similarity between the Goths, Getae, and the Yuezhi. Moreover, this opens up the possibility that at least some of the people termed \"Scythians\" were a single tribe -- the Getae. So could there have been a nation of nomads who knew themselves as Gets, Gats, Guts, or Yuts? This is not the first time that the suggestion has been offered that the Yuezhi could be related to Goths. In his Tableaux Historiques De L'Asia, Julius Von Klaproth (1783 - 1835) wrote: The name of Yueti or Yut recalls that of Yuts or Goths, which came to Europe: it would be very possible that the Yutes who arrived in Scandinavia with Odin, are the same people who three centuries before ou r era, still inhabited the area...northwest of the Chinese Kansu province.

The South Asian Jats are one such group that may lead us in the proper direction, as their settlement corresponds geographically with the Indo - Scythian settlement on the Indian subcontinent.

They have seen to it that questions concerning the west to east migration of the elements of civilization are never broached by academics. Instead of the truth we are forced to ingest irrefutable errors. However, many perceptive researchers, not willing to fall into lockstep with the official consensus on history, have seen through the smokescreens and disinformation. Their discoveries provide us with insight into all that ha s been hidden from view when it comes to prehistoric migrations and the connections between ancient peoples: When modern academics composed reference books about early Egyptian history, they scrupulously avoided mention of the impressive body of ancient ev idence attesting to the celestial rulers of predynastic Egypt – Tony Bushby ( The Secret in the Bible ) Classical archaeologists are in agreement that ancient migrations did take place in prehistoric times, although they often tend to be rather hazy about th e dates and the countries involved – Ralph Ellis ( Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs ) The religion of the ancient peoples seems to have been one throughout the entire world; a great brotherhood, a universal faith.

Is it a ren dering of Esus , the great lord of the Gaels, Goths, and Arya? Interestingly, the Book of Genesis describes Esau as a adept hunter. And that description certainly harkens back to Esus and to Herne, the animal and forest gods of the W estern elders. The story of the twin brothers, Jacob (Israel) and Esau, appears to be taken from earlier myths of pagan peoples. The version of their story that appears in the ex - canonical Book of Jubilees, is strongly reminiscent of the Egyptian story concerning the conflict be tween the twins Horus and Set. The word Horus can be rendered in many ways. It can be found as Horos, Heru, Hor, and Ha. The word means \"boundary\" or \"circle.\" Astrologically, it referred to the horizon, the boundary over which the sun god passes daily and yearly. The words hour, horizon , and horoscope come from the name of the Egyptian sun god. A pseudonym for Horus was Iusa or Iusas. W hen the letter \"I\" is translated as \"J,\" we have Jusa or Jusas. This is the origin of the Biblical Jesus. He is simply a v ersion of Horus, who was a version of the Irish Iesa, Hesus, Esus, or Esa.

Abiff may derive from Abi , meaning \"master,\" \"father,\" or \"elder.\" According to Philip Gardner, the word Hiram may derive from Hir , meaning \" head,\" or \"exalted,\" and Am , meaning \"people.\" In this instance the name would be similar in meanin g to Abraham, which can be rendered Ab Hir Am , meaning \"Father Head of the People.\" It may also derive from Ahi Ram , meaning \"Head Snake\" or \"Exalted Serpent.\" In this instance it would be similar in meaning to Pendragon, meaning \"Head of the Dragons.\" Th ere is also evidence indicating that the term \"Hiram\" was used by the Bible's mythmongers to obliquely refer to the Druids or, more specifically, to their highest degreed elder, the grand master of building, navigation, astronomy, language, and magic. It i s acknowledged by historians and Masonic writers that Hiram was of the \"Phoenician\" race. And since the Phoenicians (or more correctly the Arcadians) were elders from the British Isles, it follows that Hiram the Elder, if he existed, was a member of the Ar ya. It implies, more correctly, that \"Hiram Abi\" was yet another title referring to the chief among the Arya or"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Druids. Given the superb temples which fill Egypt, most of them erected by Amenists, we can certainly conclude that there was, among the people and their leaders, the deepest awe and respect for the master architects. The Druids taught the existence of one god, to whom they gave a name \"Be' al,\" which Celtic antiquaries tell us means \"the life of everything,\" or \"the source of all beings,\" and wh ich seems to have affinity with the Phoenician Baal. What renders this affinity more striking is that the Druids as well as the Phoenicians identified this, their supreme deity, with the Sun - Thomas Bulfinch ( Bulfinch's Mythology , Chapter XLI) The Druids had also their high places, which were large stones or piles of stones on the summits of hills. These were called Cairns, and were used in the worship of the deity under the symbol of the sun - ibid ...the Roman writers admit that \"they paid much attention to the order and laws of nature, and investigated and taught to the youth under their charge many things concerning the stars and their motions, the size of the world and the lands, and concerning the might and power of the immortal gods - ibid ...in the ve ry oldest monuments of the Druids, we have the circle of stones, in the number 12, the signs in the circle - signs of the zodiacal circle, with the arch of heaven for the cupola; and, in fact, the divisions of the heavens marked in a great variety of ways - Godfrey Higgins ( Anacalypsis ) The Kelts placed pillars on the tops of their hills, many of which are still visible.

Indeed, the Bible, in it's characteristically veiled manner, lets us know that this was the case. 2 Chronicles (2:11 - 14) tells us that Hiram was a member of the Tribe of Dan. The Tribe's emblem was the serpent. Author Barbara W alker emphasize s the W estern origin of the Danites: Writers of the Old Testament disliked the Danites, whom they called serpents (Genesis 49:17). Nevertheless, they adopted Dani - El or Daniel, a Phoenician god of divination, and transformed him into a Hebrew prophet. His magic powers were like those of the Danites emanating from the Goddess Dana and her sacred serpents...Daniel was not a personal name but a title, like the Celtic one - ( The Woman‟s Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets ) Her point, and ours, is strengthened by Ph ilip Gardiner, author of the book Gnosis: The Secret of Solomon‟s Temple Revealed. In Gardiner's work we find intriguing facts about Hiram and the Irish (or Aryan) connection. The most intriguing reference concerns Hiram and the symbol of the serpent. The serpent was the symbol of the ancient Dragon Court and of the Irish Druids (the Adders, Naddreds, or Pendragons, etc). It also served as the universal symbol for wisdom and royalty. There are more real links between Hiram and the serpent. For instance, we noted above that he was of the Tribe of Naphtali. The standard of the Tribe of Naphtali, according to Jewish tradition, is a serpent or basilisk and this could have come from Egyptian origins, as Jewish tradition states that Naphtali was the brother of Jos eph, chosen to represent the family to Pharaoh – Philip Gardiner ( Gnosis: The Secret of Solomon‟s Temple Revealed ) ...Hiram is said to be a son of the Tribe of Dan and even the tribe of Dan had an emblem, which was amazingly also the serpent, this time with a horse – ibid According to Rabbinical teaching the prefabrication of the Temple was performed by the Shamir, a giant worm or serpent that could cut stones (incidentally worm means serpent). Not dissimilar to Norse and Celtic beliefs where Valhalla and Cam elot were built with the fire of the dragon and in China where building is aided by the serpent energy – ibid This is what the Bible has to say about Hiram Abiff: And now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, Huram my master craftsman, (t he son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre), skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple and blue, fine linen and crimson, and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan which may be gi ven to him, with your skillful men and with the skilful men of my lord David your father – (2 Chronicles 2:13 - 14)"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Hiram was referred to as a \"widow's son.\" This anecdote refers to the heavens. In this case, Hiram would be the sun and the widow, his mother, would be the supreme goddess of heaven, variously known as Apt, Taurt, Nuith, Isis, etc. Additionally, the term \"widow\" can refer to the Irish goddess Eri, and in this case it would strengthen our theory of the Irish symbolism that has been employed in th e story of Hiram Abiff. Hiram is described in the Book of Chronicles as - the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan. Christians will say this refers to the Israelite Tribe of Dan. But we might ask if there is there something more to this term Dan? Additio nally, was there some significance to the Tribe of Dan having a serpent for their clan symbol? W e think there is indeed a good reason, one which has to do with Druidism. Not only are the names of the twelve so - called Tribes of Israel Irish names, but the v arious emblems of the tribes originate with Druidism. The root dan (and related roots such as don, dona, adon , and dun , etc) can, for instance, be found throughout the world. It is particularly conspicuous in regions frequented by \"Celts.\" It originates wi th Danu, a prehistoric Irish deity and one of the most prominent goddesses known. Her name can also be rendered Anu, or Ana. In this form the name turns up among the Babylonians and Sumerians. The name connotes the heavens. This is one reason why the serpe nt was a symbol for the Danites. The serpent is Draco of the zodiac. Draco figuratively guards the northernmost stars, those considered most sacred to ancient astrologers. The great cosmic serpent was, however, a symbol for the female. The Egyptian hierogl yph denoting woman was a serpent. In light of this, there can be little doubt that the Danites, referred to as Israelites, were really astrologers, that is, Arya . Hiram is said to have hailed from the great Phoenician city of Tyre. But this city bears an I rish name. Tyre and Tara both derive from the name of Eri. And, as we stated above, Eri's name was the origin of the name Ireland. Eri is the Hera of the Greeks. Her name is still preserved in words such as terra and terrestrial , denoting the earth. Hiram has also been associated with Osiris. A comparison of the myths of these two figures reveals many similarities: Both went to foreign lands to share their knowledge of arts and sciences In both legends there is a precious thing possessed: Hiram has the secr et word; Osiris has the kingdom In both legends there is a wicked conspiracy by evil men to seize the precious thing In both legends there is a struggle and a murder of the virtuous leader"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":" Both are murdered by their brothers (Osiris by Typhon; Hiram by Jub elum, his brother Mason) Both bodies are buried hastily, with the intention of a later, deliberate burial Locations of the bodies are both marked by Acacia at the head In both legends, there are two separate searches for the bodies In both legends there is a loss of something precious: in Hiram's death, the secret word is lost; in Osiris' death, the phallus is lost In both there is a substitution for the precious thing that has been lost; concerning Hiram it is the substitute for the secret word; concerning Osiris it is the substitute phallus. - (Thanks to http://watch.pair.com/symbol.html#hiram) The name Osiris derives from the Egyptian Ausares , which can be more correctly rendered Aus Ari . In this instance we see the all important phoneme ari . The worship of Osiris (god of the Amenists and of the Underworld) was, we believe, transported to Egypt from the west in prehistoric times. The similarities between Osiris and the Irish fertility gods is uncanny. From the midst of chaos was born Osiris, and at his bir th a voice was heard proclaiming − \"The ruler of all the earth is born\"...Osiris traveled over the whole world, and civilized its inhabitants, and taught them the art of agriculture. But on his return to Egypt the jealous Typhon laid a stratagem for him, a nd in the midst of a banquet had him shut up in a chest which exactly fitted his body. He was nailed down in his prison, which cast into the Nile floated down to the sea - W. Winwood Reade ( The Veil of Isis, or Mysteries of the Druids , 1861) Hiram, Hermes, and Herne Since vowels were absent in most ancient writings (Egyptian, Hebrew, Greek, etc), the word Hiram can be rendered HRM. This, in turn, can be re - rendered HERMES. In this permutation, the term refers to secret knowledge and the Hermetic Tradition. The name of Hermes, however, is a derivation of the Irish Herne. Herne, also known as Cernunnos, Nikor, or as the Green Man, was the stag - horned forest god. He was seen depicted (like Orpheus and Krishna) sitting tranquilly among the forest animals. Herne was also depicted holding a circlet in one hand and a serpent in another. (As we saw above, the serpent features prominently in the story of Hiram Abiff). The circlet and serpent motif connotes the number 10, now known as ten. W hen the Greek letters of the name Hermes are added, we get 343, which equals 10. If the name Hiram connotes the mysteries of the number ten, then Abiff , meaning \"Father\" or \"Elder,\" simply implies that the number ten was considered the \"Father Number.\""},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Indeed, the ancient architects and geometrists of Egypt, Greece, and Ireland, held the number in high esteem. Ten was a most sacred number. Primordial gods (such as Atum Ra) and archetypal figures (such as Adam) were esoterically associated with the number ten. In English numerology, th e letters of ATUM (1, 2, 3, 4) add to 10. This is the same for the letters of the name ADAM (1, 4, 1, 4). The human hands figuratively denote 1414 - that is one thumb and four fingers, on each hand - ergo 1414 (or 10). Ergo, the numerological testament pro claims each and every man to be an \"Adam.\" In their book entitled The Hiram Key , Masonic authors Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas contend that Hiram Abiff was Pharaoh Seqenenre Tao II, of Egypt's seventeenth dynasty.

Like most of the Templar nobility, he had visited E ngland and was probably educated by Culdean Monks from Ireland. Masonic lore tells us that he bore the title \"Hiram Abiff,\" which lends credence to our contention that (like David and Solomon, etc) Hiram Abiff was indeed a title and not a personal name.

Herne is also a prototype of the Hindu Shiva (or Pashupati). Ogma's name is pronounced auma, or as a long - sounding aum. This is close to the Sanskrit sa cred phoneme AUM .

This symbolism does not originate with those races taking the credit for it today. Top Jewish rabbis and scholars have deftly concealed their own puzzlement concerning the Kabala and why it is part of their rabbinical canon. They take credit for it and pretend that they understand it, but they do not know its origins or how it really came into their possession. It did so from their association with the Egyptian Solar Cult of Aton. Like many Egyptian idioms and teachings the Kabala was absorbed by association. It is not a creation of the Old Testament Jews. Researcher Kieran Barry (although he is not concerned with the Irish or the Druids) offers compelling evidence to show that the Kabala was known to the Greeks before it was known to the Jews. W hat he does not realize is that it came to the Greeks by way of the Hermetic colleges themselves founded upon Druidic mystery traditions. Of all the modern researchers into this field, it was Robert Graves, Godfrey Higgins, Albert Churchward , and the great Gerald Massey, who understood the truth presented here concerning the Irish origins of the Kabala, the Tree of Life, and the sacred alphabets. The image of the living, organic Tree of Life was a pagan symbol that does not derive from the Le vitical tradition. It was a most ancient motif of ancient Caucasian tribes and it appears in the Scandinavian Viking tradition as Yggdrasil, the cosmic tree that has its roots in the underworld and its branches in the heavens, and which is demarked by seven major stages, in a similar way as we find in the chakra system. Around Yggdrasil coils the serpent, another symbol employed largely by the Iri sh and the Egyptians. ...we can see that the greater number of the peculiar features of this history existed in Egypt -- the tree of life and knowledge, the serpent of Paradise, Eve thinking of appropriating divinity to herself, and in short Adam himself, ar e all there - M.

These are the elementary principles of the written W ord, reflection of that spoken Word that created the world! - Albert Pike ( Morals and Dogma ) The motif of the Tree of Life was known to the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Irish Magi. As the Christian Christ hung on the tree, so did the great hero Odin ritually hang upon a great tree in order to self - initiate himself into the mysteries of life. The tree became a symbol of the royal couple, the king and queen, who were considered agents of the gods. On the plagiarization of ancient gnosis, Professor. L. A. W addell wrote: ...the Hebrew rabbis who composed Genesis with its Garden of Eden and Creation of Man story, had manifestly helped themselves to the floating traditional history in late Babylon in respect to the oldest kings known to the ancient world, n amely the kings of the First Aryan Dynasty. But not understanding it, they had travestied the historical facts and the noble character of the great King \"Adam,\" by making \"Adam\" to be the first lowly \"created\" man, instead of the first man and superman - ( Makers of Civilization in Race and History ) The Number Three The number 3 was extremely important in the Shamanic tradition because it represented the harmonious median between conflicting polarities, such as ignorance and knowledge, or folly and wisdom, e tc. Three represented the agents of harmony. The Druids understood that nature did not possess such vexatious dichotomies, but that the minds of men most certainly did. Duality was a phenomenon of consciousness, not of nature, even though a fragmented psyc he may erroneously project that falsity, and then believe it to be the case. In W elsh the word for three is tri, and that is the same in Sanskrit. The Irish Gaelic word for Trinity is Triquetra , which is similar to the Sanskrit word Trikuta , which means \"T hree Peaks.\" In Egypt, the hieroglyphic depicting three peaks or hills signified \"foreigners,\" or travelers from distant lands. Druidic Ireland was divided according to the hemispheres of consciousness. There were four main counties, with one administrativ e center making the fifth sacred province. This province was called Mide, (or Meath) which meant the middle place .

The Egyptian supreme goddess of balance and harmony was called Ma'at, and this word is of Gaelic origin. Ma'at is the great mother, the same type as Danu or Brigit. Her name meant \"straight,\" \"true,\" or \"just.\" The hieroglyph denoting Ma'at also signified the mathematical formula one half (1 divided by 2). The power of the Magi lay in their understanding and application of the properties of the Third Principle . Iesa, the third aspect of the Druidic Trinity, was their most venerated god. Iesa was t he prototype of Jesus and he can also be linked to the Hindu god Shiva, the lord of deconstruction and renewal. This Third Principle turns up in the Christian canon as the Holy Spirit, the symbol of which is the dove. ...among the whole of them three class es more especially are held in distinguished veneration, the Bards, the Ovates, and the Druids.

Mystery school traditions such as Kabalism wer e based on the teachings of the Druid Elders. Druidic colleges employed tripartite divisions. The very Druidic Order was subdivided into three parts. And the Druidic Trinity (Bel, Taranis, Esus) was surely the archetype upon which all others were based. A ncient Egyptian religion had from the earliest times displayed a natural inclination to the arrangement of its gods in groupings of threes, or \"triads.\" Following the model of Osiris - Isis - Horus, the triad later took on a \"familial\" pattern of father - mo ther - child, and several cities worshipped their own particular variations on theme - Nicholas Reeves Hebrew theology was divided into three distinct parts. The first was the law, the second was the soul of the law, and the third was the soul of the soul of the law.

Advisor to Nuada, Lugh's full title was Sami - Ildanach which meant \"Master of all the Arts.\" Riding toward Balor Lugh slew his giant rival with the stone from a sling. This story of Lugh predates the rise of Judaism and perfectly illustrates the penchant for plagiarization of the later mythmongers, working on their assignments, under orders from the Atonists sitting high on their thrones in Britain and Rome. Their data had been compiled over centuries. The mythmongers had at least 600 years to assimilate the Druidic tropes.

As we have shown, \"Israel\" is merely a code word . It originally referred to the wise - ones of Egypt, Ireland, Palestine, and the world, to the high initiates of the stellar mysteries. It was later adopted and used by the Aton Cult, whose descendants commissioned the writing of the Bible, and who funded the rescripting of ancient history in order to disguise their own origins, as well as the facts about the various power races, tribes and cults of the ancient world. The United States of America is symbolized by an eagle with arrows and olive branches in its talons. To the scholars who buy into the official story of the migration of Semitic tribes, this symbol derives from the Judaic Tribe of Manasseh. Above the eagle's head on the dollar bill is the six - pointed Star of David. The term \"Camp David,\" comes from the Israelite or Atonist symbolic canon.

They used the Asiatic cross, now called that of St. Andrew‘s. Notably, in an Irish version of the gospel of St. Matthew, the phrase ―there came wise men from the eas t‖ is rendered ―the Druids came from the east.‖ In like manner, in the Old Testament, Exodus vii.

Recent Discoveries Confirming the Irish Origins of Civilization Introduction Was there a super - advanced culture in prehistory? If not, how can it be that the supposedly unsophisticated people of Stone Age Britain possessed a fully - integrated system of measurement based on a deep understanding of the solar system? In Appendix III, entitled: The Minoan Civilization of Crete, we present a f ew passages from the book The Knights Templar Revealed, by Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe. Civilization One , by Alan Butler and Christopher Knight. The passages deal with the so - called \"Megalithic Yard,\" a measurement that ancient western adepts frequently employed when laying out and constructing innumerable sacred sites (stone circles, dolmens, cairns, tumuli, and so on) throughout Britain and Europ e. The first man to rediscover this important measurement was the Scottish engineer Professor Alexander Thom. In 1955, he recorded his discoveries in his books Stonehenge ; Stonehenge as a Possible Lunar Observatory; and A Statistical Examination of Megalit hic Sites in Britain. Professor Thom, fascinated over his own discoveries, explained the anomaly of the Megalithic Yard in these words: This unit was in use from one end of Britain to the other. It is not possible to detect by statistical examination any differences between the values determined in the English and Scottish circles. There must have been a headquarters from which the standard rods (a rod could be of two types but in this context they are pieces of wood cut to represent the Megalithic Yard) w ere sent out...The length of rods in Scotland cannot have differed from that in England by more than 0.03 inch (0.762 mm) ore the difference would have shown up. If each small community had obtained the length by copying the rod from its neighbour to the s outh the accumulated error would have been much greater than this - ( Megalithic Sites in Britain ) Since Professor Thom's time, the investigators Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe have discovered additional information concerning the widespread application"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"of t he Megalithic Yard. They have also discovered that its origins were in the far west. Their seminal discoveries serve to strengthen our own theories concerning the west to east movement of the elements of civilization which sadly these authors do not consid er or address in their otherwise fine works. The megalithic yard is much older...and was certainly in use in Britain as early as 3500 BC, at which time the Minoan civilization was still a full thousand years short of its ultimate emergence. Since there is little or no evidence of the existence of the megalithic system within central or southern Europe, the inference must surely be that the Minoan civilization ultimately responded to ideas that had originated further West - Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) In 2004, Alan Butler went to work with Christopher Knight, and together they authored an excellent book on the significance of the Megalithic Yard. In this book, entitled Civilization One: The World Is Not As You Thought It Was, Butler and Knight successfully demolish the long accepted fallacies concerning the primitivism of ancient man. They write: Generations of investigators have assumed that stone circles and other prehistoric monuments were built for some unknown pagan ritual istic purposes by otherwise unsophisticated Stone Age tribes...The evidence of Thom's Megalithic Yard has demolished any notion of the naivety of its creators assumed by most archaeologists. We have to respect these forgotten people for the great astronome rs and geometricians they certainly were. It seems that there must have been a Civilization One; an advanced people who trained the rest of the world in science and technology, thereby leading it out of the Stone Age. The builders of the Stone Age monumen ts of the British Isles used a unit of length that was defined to one ten - thousandth of a millimeter. That unit is fundamental to the Sun, Moon, and Earth. Dr Michael Rappenglueck of the University of Munich has shown how a 16,000 - year - old drawing of a hor se in the caves of Lascaux in France is actually a carefully recorded Lunar calendar. ...Alan's previous research had led him to believe that the Megalithic Yard was, and is, a \"geodetic\" unit. This means that it was derived from the geometry of the Earth itself - specifically, it was based on the polar circumference of the planet. After studying evidence from the Minoan culture that had developed on the Mediterranean island of Crete some 4,300 years ago, Alan had concluded that the Minoan astronomer - priest s had regarded a circle as having 366 degrees rather than 360 degrees that we use today. The evidence also suggested that the Megalithic culture of Britain had done the same...there are 366 rotations of the Earth in a year. A sidereal day is the time it ta kes for one revolution of the planet, measured by observing a star returning to the same point in the heavens on two consecutive nights...This sidereal day, or rotation period, is 236 seconds shorter than a mean solar day, and over the year these lost seco nds add up to exactly one extra day, giving a year"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"of just over 366 sidereal days...In short, anyone who gauged the turning of the Earth by watching the stars would know full well that the planet turns a little over 366 times in a year...If they considered each complete turn of the Earth to be one degree of the great circle of heaven...they would also logically accept that there are 366 degrees in a circle. Butler and Knight prove that the Megalithic Yard was used by many cultures throughout the world. It h as been found in Crete and was certainly employed by that island's two cultures, the Minoan and Mycenaean. These cultures influenced the ancient Greeks who also employed the Megalithic Yard measurement. The Indo - Aryans from Northern India employed a unit o f measurement called the \"gaz.\" It too was based on the Megalithic Yard. Of the connections between the Indus Valley civilizations of India and the western lands of Britain, the authors write: There is no evidence that we are aware of that gives a precise measure for the gaz but we know it was very close to the Megalithic Yard, which was still in use in Britain when the earliest Indus Valley cities were established. Could international communications have been so advanced as to allow a southern Asian cultur e to take its measurement system from the Megalithic builders of the western fringes of Europe? Or is it more likely that all the ancient cultures we have looked at had the same teachers? Could an otherwise unknown group of super - scientists, that we have d ubbed 'Civilization One' have trained indigenous peoples around the world to accelerate global civilization. The authors discovered that the ancient Megalithic builders were aware of the Pi and Phi ratios: We found that the Megalithic numbers produced circ les that combined the mathematical ratios known as pi and phi. Both are irrational numbers yet they produced results that are so close to being perfect as to be negligible. In our investigation we found that an American PhD student had discovered the exist ence of phi in Thom's data back in the early 1970s - a fact confirmed by the great man himself when he described the finding as \"magical.\" The authors also discovered that the Megalithic Yard, employed in ancient stone circles, was a measurement certainly based not only on the dimensions of the earth, but also of the moon and sun: We looked at the circumference of the Moon and found that it conforms to Megalithic geometry with precisely 100 Megalithic Yards to a lunar second of arc. Then we found that the S un also conforms to Megalithic geometry with 40,000 Megalithic Yards to a second of arc.

Perfectly aligned to the Winter Solstice it is built without cement in a manner that has never been duplicated or understood. It stands near to the Boyne River, named after the goddess Boann. Newgrange is connected with several major Irish heroes, particularly Midir and Aengus. In modern times the many massive base stones were deliberately turned face inwards to obscure their highly detailed astronomical i nscriptions and etchings. The famous triskellion of three spirals exists within the center of the cairn. Within the structure is a small room into which, on the three days of the Winter Solstice, a thin beam of sunlight penetrates for 17 seconds. The light falls within a few inches of the symbol of the three spirals. This anomaly is a analogy of the spiritual light (wisdom) entering into the purified mind of man. The inner chamber of the cairn is cross - shaped. The cross was worshipped throughout the world l ong before the advent of Judeo - Christianity. Modern engineers are baffled as to Newgrange's construction and are unable to emulate its modeling.

The Minoan Civilization of Crete The Mediterranean island of Crete, south of Greece. Some speculate that the Minoan Civilization was a remnant of Atlantis. Click here for info on Crete Our thesis concerning the global influence of the Irish is substantiated by archaeological and technical discoveries of recent years. It is confirmed by recent studies into the Minoan civilization of Crete. Two modern authors who have examined the Minoan culture are Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe. Their books, The Warriors and the Bankers and The Knights Templar Revealed, furnish us with an new understanding concerning this Aegean civilization that so closely resembles the Irish. Unfortunately, like so many researchers throughout the ages, these authors do not consider anything but the East to West transit of the elements of civilization. That the reverse situation could have occurred is, alas, a question that does not enter their minds even thou gh their own discoveries, when seen from the correct perspective, strongly support the theory. Some of their key di s coveries regarding the Cretans and the world's powerful secret societies strongly vindicate our personal controversial beliefs regarding the importance of the Irish Druids, the Arya, in world history. While looking into the geometry employed by the Cretans in the creation of their cities, towns, and ritual centers, the authors inadvertently stumbled across proofs concerning the West to East mo vement of the elements of civiliz a tion. It became clear to Butler and Dafoe that some ancient W estern race had not only measured the Earth in detail, but had created a vast network of ge o mantic lines across Britain, France, and W estern Europe.

The Egypti an Connection From an academic point of view, the Minoan civilization is considered the finest in Europe. It was sophisticated and an inspiration to many other races. The work of Butler and Dafoe reveals the Cretans to have been a technically advanced West ern people. As we mention above, recent discoveries suggest the Cretans were related biologically or, at least economically, with the Hyksos"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"kings of Egypt. Artwork found in the Hyksos city of Avaris appears to be of Cretan artifice, and a few investigator s believe trade took place between these peoples. W riters, such as Ralph Ellis, point to the fact that when the Minoan civilization was brought to an end by the devastating volcanic eruption on the nearby island of Thera, the Hyksos empire subsequently wen t into rapid decline. The search for a stronger relationship between the Hyksos of Egypt and the Cretans continues. Examples of Minoan merchandise have regularly turned up in various tombs in Egypt. They have been found in the Levant and, through the matt er is somewhat contentious, Minoan - type jewelry and goldwork has even been found in the graves of Wessex Cult u re, a race living in what is now southern England at a time contemporary with Minoan Crete at its heyday. The Cretans established a chain of outpo sts throughout the Aegean and the Mediterranean...trade was probably on a fairly large scale. Soon after the take o ver of Crete by the Mycenaeans of mainland Greece sometime around 1400 BC, there are records to indicate that the palace of Knossos alone was running over 50,000 sh e ep - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) ...there is much on Crete from Minoan times to show the existence of a flourishing mi d dle class which may have been partly made up of private merchants. Plush villas hav e been located, some very close to the many ports of the island, whilst in those places where everyday Minoan life is viewable, such as in the lava - buried settlement on Sant o rini, it appears that even the common folk of the Cretans lived a very comfortable life - ibid The Creta ns and the Biblical Philistines After the Minoan civilization was decimated by the eruption of Thera, the Cretans took refuge in the Levant where they were known as the Philistines. It is important to remember the antipathy which exis ted between the Philistines and the Israelites. Given that the latter were of the Hyksos clan we can say that there may be flaws in the theories of certain investigators (such as Ralph Ellis) who have assumed a connection between the Cretans and the Hyksos . If this connection was as intimate as asserted then we are bound to ask why those \"Israelites,\" whom we now understand to be identical with the Hyksos, would not be close friends or allies of the Philistines? Either the Bible's accounts are inaccurate, o r we have to consider it likely that the Philistines (originally from Crete) were not, in fact, affiliated with the biblical Israelites in an intimate way. The Hyksos (Israelites) were patristic. They were Atonists. And this also suggests they were unrelat ed to the Cretans whose entire civilization revolved around goddess worship. The fact that the Cretans, and possibly the Philistines, were matriarchal may be one of the main reasons for the antipathy reported to have existed between them and the Hyksos peo ple. The chief god of the Philistines was Baal. This is most suggestive, since Baal was probably a version of the Irish and Phoenician Bel. Baal (pronounced bayal ) was associated with the bull and this animal was venerated by the arch - enemies of the Hyksos , the Amenists of Egypt."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"And so, an alternative theory could be that the early Cretans were closer to the Amenists of Thebes, rather than to the Atonists (Israelites) of Avaris and H e liopolis. And since the Cretans were influenced by Megalithic races from the W est, could their Amenist confederates in the land of the Nile not also have been? W e see no reason to doubt this conjecture. The Minoan civilization was based on sheep and salt. The Dead Sea area is exceedingly rich in salt, which is why the Cretans, or Philistines, would have been satisfied to set up a new base in the region after their own homeland was rendered unlivable. ...the very name \"Palestine\" is directly responsive to Minoan Crete for it derives from the word \"Philistine\" which is the name g iven to a particular group of people present in the area by the emerging Hebrews, who themselves were operative in Palestine from about 1400 BC onwards...significant amounts of Minoan - type artefacts have been found in Gaza Technology From the Western Races The Druids are men of penetrating and subtle spirit, and acquired the highest renown by their speculations, which were at once subtle and profound. Both Caesar and Mela plainly intimate that they were conversant with most sublime speculations in geometry and in measuring the magnitude of the earth - Ammianus Marscellus (Historian 350 AD) Despite the cover - ups and lies told about the ancients we find that the further we go back in time the more sophisticated and elaborate the technology b e comes. The skill o f the ancients can hardly be fathomed. W e also find that the technological expertise and scientific abilities were transported across Europe in a direction contrary to the official consensus of establishment historians. W e find that the technically endowed race moved from the W est to the East and not the other way around. The late Professor Alexander Thom, an engineer from Oxford University, worked tirelessly for many decades, carefully surveying and measuring the many megalithic sta n ding stones, stone circ les and other alignments left on the landscape of Britain and parts of France since truly ancient times. One important fact emerged as a result of such tireless efforts. Almost every monument, dating from at least 3500 BC until around 1500 BC, had been bui lt using the same basic linear measurement. This, Professor Thom discovered, was on average 82.96656 cm in length and he named it the \"megali t hic yard\" When applied to the geometry and mathematics that Alan had discovered in Crete, it became obvious that t he megalithic yard was part of a mathematical \"world view\" that had perpetuated across a vast period of time and throughout large areas of Europe. With the megalithic yard and the geometry of which it was an intrinsic part, the ancient peoples of Britain, and locations much further afield, must have had an astonishing knowledge of the true dimensions of the Earth upon which they lived"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"The Cretans and Unknown Western Influences The Cretans had formed an important part of the \"megalithic cultures\" originally emanating from the far west of Europe, though thanks to a twist of geological fate, they u l timately found themselves living amidst the Semitic races in the Middle East The megalithic yard is much older...and was certainly in use in Britain as early as 3500 BC, at which time the Minoan civilization was still a full thousand years short of its u l timate emergence. Since there is little or no evidence of the existence of the megalithic system within central or southern Europe, the inference must surely be that the Minoan civilization ultimately responded to ideas that had originated further West The Religion of the Cretans In terms of religion, the chief deity seems to have been a goddess whose personality differed depending on what sphere of life was the focus of attention at any particular point in time. Nature worship was certainly present, with a preference for the depiction on ritual vessels and seals of various types of trees - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) Xavier Guichard & Ear th Geomancy Guichard believed that parts of western Europe had once been covered by a series of long straight lines, sometimes running for many kilometres across the landscape. Many of these, he maintained, commenced at central \"hubs\" and radiated outward, like the spokes of a bicycle wheel...along along the lines were settlements which contained place names of a very specific type. All the places in question contained an \"al\" comp o nent, for example \"Alaise,\" \"Calaise,\" Falaise,\" and the like The Salt Line Dynasties The \"al\" component, Guichard believed, was the remnant of the Greek word \"hal,\" which means salt. Guichard through therefore that these lines across the landscape had been a form of navigation most probably used from the early transportation of s alt from one place to another Ancient Occult Geomancy Revealed In addition to the radiating \"bicycle spoke\" lines, Guichard also claimed to have found another, completely different, set of lines. These were very much like the modern lines of longitude and latitude to be found on any map. Once again these were sprinkled with the \"al\" place names, but unlike modern lines of longitude and latitude, they were not exactly I modern degree of arc apart. Guichard's lines...were almost exactly 59 modern minutes of a rc apart...the period during which Guichard claimed the lines had been laid down was contemporary with the use of the megalithic yard and in the same geogra p hical areas ...our Bronze Age ancestors had considered the Earth to be split into 366 divisions, an d not 360...it stood to reason that longitudinal lines would be very slightly closer"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"toge t her. The expectation was that they would occur at just over 59 modern minutes of arc The \"Celtic\" Connection The Celts, probably moving into Britain after about 500 B C, had shown a great revere n ce for the Salt Lines and had placed many shrines and sacred sites upon them. This had also been true of the Romans and, later, the Anglo - Saxons The most surprising aspect to Salt Line research lay in the fact that it soon becam e o b vious that the run of the lines, though actually invisible on the ground, had retained a mystical significance for countless centuries after those creating the lines had ceased to exist The Templar Connection After discovering the work of Xavier Guicha rd, and after researching the so - called \"Salt Lines\" which had existed all over France, Britain, and W estern Europe from ancient times, Alan Butler discovered something interesting about the elite Norman families of France that had accompanied W illiam I to England in order to invade and conquer that country. The Normans who had estates and houses on prominent locations of the Salt Line matrix deliberately set up their new English estates and houses on Salt Line locations. This act confirmed their awareness of the Salt Line matrix. W hat's more, Alan Butler discovered that some of the most prominent Normans who were positioning themselves so deliberately, according to occult megalithic geometry, played a prominent part in the Crusades and in the creation of th e Cistercian monastic order. These Normans seized Britain for the Vatican and they also lead the war to take Jerusalem from the Saracen. They were the same men who went on to form the Knights Templar. The work of Guichard, Butler, and Dafoe, therefore, rev eals that the Templars were fully aware of Druidic geometry, and had taken great pains to empower themselves by way of it. The Knights Templar were closely associated with the Order of Zion and Knights of St. John Hospitalers. It was whilst studying these very powerful French and Norman families that Alan sta r ted to come across the names of individuals who had played an important part in the prosecution of the First Crusade, which captured Jerusalem for Christianity in 1099. These same families, and other Salt Line families who were blood - related to them, had been instrumental in the formation of the Cistercian monastic order and that of the Knights Templar T he Templars and the Cistercians Butler and Dafoe's assert that the Templars were an offshoot of the Cistercian monastic order whose vast estates sat all too precisely on Salt Line locales.

Perhaps, we postulated, there were also tangible associations between the same people and the remnant of the Minoan civilization, itself a megalithi c culture The Essenes, Templars, and Cistercians Butler and Dafoe have thrown new light on that mysterious sect known as the Essenes. The Essenes are believed to be the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls which the Vatican wished to sequester after their disco very in the mid 1940s. Officially, the Essenes have been considered an extremist Jewish sect who broke away from the synagogues and temples of the Pharisees and Sadduc e es in order to live a monastic life. However, there is little actual proof for this conj ecture, and scholars cannot agree on the actual origins or beliefs of the Essenes. Butler and Dafoe maintain that there are close parallels between the Essenes and the Cistercian order. If this be true, it would establish a direct link between the Essenes of the ancient world and the Knights Templar. One of the accusations levied to the Templars by the Church of Rome (after their fa l lout) was that they venerated a severed bearded male head. If the Templars did indulge in a practice of this kind it might be because of their relationship to the Essenes since John the Baptist, the beheaded initiator of Jesus Christ, was an Essene leader . ...we can find no monastic institution anywhere near as similar to the Essene commun i ties as that of the much later Cistercia ns The authors go on to delineate the parallels of belief and activity between the Essenes and Cistercians in their book. (See page 43). The Merovingian Connection Central to the rise of the Templars and Cistercian order was the powerful M e rovingian kings and princes. This French dynasty was very ancient. It may have been connected to the Amorites. Interestingly, the syllable mero (from \"M e rovingian\") is not far removed from Amero or Amarru , the name for the ancient Amorites of Syria and Babylon. They may h ave also been descended from the infamous Hyksos dynasties of Egypt. It appears that this is likely since the Freemasonic orders which arose due to Merovingian patronage embody Atonist - Israelite theology. Moreover, the authors Michael Baigent, Richard Leig h, and Henry Lincoln have asserted, in their much disputed book Holy Blood, Holy Grail , that Jesus Christ was a Merovingian. Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe have uncovered crucial facts about the earliest days of the Knights Templar and have exposed the Mer o vingian influence behind the French cabals. Their findings substantiate a good deal of the information to be found in Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which was pu b lished in 1982.

All was well in Frankish Gaul until the reign of Dagobert II...held the throne between AD 673 and 676. The kingship of Dagobert did not last long and yet it represents one of the most important departures in the story of the Cistercian and the Knights Templar. As a result of Dagobert's death, a cauldron of conflicting ideas and interests came about. Amidst the ensuing turmoil, the old Salt Line families of France and Britain embarked n an initiative that nearl y turned Europe completely on its head. The ultimate result of their efforts was the creation of the Cistercians and their armed brothers, the Templars The authors insist that Dagobert had spent time in Ireland were he had been exposed to the teachings of the Culdean monks. Through them he learned a heretical type of Christianity that was frowned upon by the Vatican hierarchy. The complex dynastic agreements which existed between the Vatican and the kings of France would be jeopardized if a hostile king ca me to the throne, r e placing the forefathers who had been so easy to control. The Vatican set about supporting a Carolingian king to supplant Dagobert whom they distru s ted. They wanted a puppet king completely loyal to the tenets of Roman Catholicism, and n ot someone that had been contaminated by Irish Culdaism i n fused with Druidic elements. This alignment with the Carolingian dynasty was unusual given the fact that the latter had no love for Roman Catholicism, and had even persecuted Latin Christians. Frank ish Catholicism under the Mer o vingians and Carolingians was the greatest threat to Roman Catholicism. Causing divisions between the Frankish dynasties was a good way to stren g then and ensure the Vatican's own domination. The French kings had invaded and co nquered Britain and were a powerful force to be reckoned with. The Franks conquered territory far beyond the original borders of their homeland, extending down into northern Italy and threatening the autonomy of the Vatican. Ultimat e ly, feudal values were passed to the emerging Normans who in turn carried the princi p les, together with the now fully developed Roman Catholicism, to England after the Conquest of 1066 The Burgundian Connection In the history of secret societies certain locations figure prominen tly.

Godfroi de Bouillon - His Templar colleagues, and many other nobles of France and Europe, were taught and When the Crusaders seized Jerusalem Godfroi was offered the crown. He mysteriously turned the offer down and his brother Bald win became the first king of Jerusalem. The French Templars had extended their dominion even further afield. This made them happy but even though they were employed by the Roman Church, they now posed and even greater threat to that Church which watched Fr ankish expansion with caution. The authors stress that there were very important reasons why Godfroi rejected the privilege of becoming the first king of Jerusalem. (See Volume Two). They focus attention on what was happening secretly in the city of Troyes , the capital of the Templar elites. It was from the palace of the Hugh, Count of Champagne, that plans were being laid for the overthrow of the Roman version of Christianity. The Burgundian families had been raised in the Culdean tradition and although th ey"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"guided by Irish Culdean monks, steeped in the Druidic tradition which they publicl y abolished. The Cistercian Order, of which Bernard de Clairvaux was a most senior member, was founded by St Robert of Molesme. outwardly took orders from Rome they secretly despised Rome's control. Hugh and his close associates, including Godfroi de Bouillon, wished to end the p o wer of the Vatican and replace its version of Christianity with something older and more \"elevated.\" Bernard de Clairvaux Soon after this time a major figure in Christian history appears on the stage. His name was Bernard de Clairvaux, and he was a major spokesman and a d vocate for the Templars. ...in 1115, so the story goes, Hugh, Count of Champagne off ered a tract of land not far from Troyes for the foundation of a new Cistercian abbey. Bernard was only twenty - five years of age and had been a monk for just over two years and yet, against all the odds, he was chosen to be abbot of the new establishment, which he called Clairvaux - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) At heart, Bernard of Clairvaux was a believer in the old Roman and Celtic Church which had ruled its own affairs, quite immune from interference from the king or his vas sal lords. This was the Burgundian and Merovingian way, and the Salt Line families appear never to have swayed from a belief in extremely old forms of Christianity - ibid Bernard de Clairvaux had close ties with Ireland. He was one of the founders of the Ciste r cian movement that had its first monasteries in Ireland De Clairvaux was instrumental not only in the progress of the Cistercian order of France but also in the education and nomination of Pope Innocent II (real name Gregorio Papareschi) who would replace Pope Honorius II in Rome. Interestingly, his choice was based on the fact that Innocent was a committed believer in the sanctity and importance of the Virgin Mary. Bernard himself was particularly enamored by king Solomon, and we cannot stress the significance of this enough. Did the Knights of the Temple of Solomon adopt their name because they admired this old world, Old Test a ment, figure more than Jesus Christ? Further evidence for Bernard's personal respect for a femin i ne aspect to godhead come s from his virtual obsession with a book of the Bible known as Solomon's Song of Songs. This is one of the strangest parts of the Jewish and Christian Old Testament, and at base owes little to Judaism in its present, orthodox sense - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed )"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"Another reason why Bernard de Clairvaux's role was so vital to the advanc e ment of the Knights Templar is clarified when we understand the content of his document De Laude Novae Militae (\"In Praise of the New Knighthood \" ) , written in praise of the Templars and to bring them public recognition. The document was conceived by Hugh de Payens who desired a way to make the world u n derstand what made the Templars different from other chivalric orders, and a Templar different fr om other knights. Apparently, this piece of propaganda worked wonders for the order. In particular, the document stressed that the fact that the Templars were a fraternity of monks as well as soldiers. Thus in a wondrous and unique manner they appear gentl er than lambs, yet fiercer than lions. I do not know if it would be more appropriate to refer to them as monks or as so l diers, unless perhaps it would be better to recognize them as being both. Indeed they lack neither romantic meekness nor military might - Bernard de Clairvaux ( De Laude N o vae Militae ) The original Templar knights remained in Jerusalem until 1127 when most of them r e turned to Champagne. There, in Troyes...they were officially declared to be a monastic order sanctioned by the pope of the day , Honorius II. No pope would have been wise to refuse the request, especially since it was made by Bernard of Clairvaux, undoubtedly the most powerful man in Western Christendom by this period - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) Te mplars, Cistercians and Nasoreans Helinand, the most frequently quoted medieval author on the subject of the Grail, was greatly influenced by Bernard of Clairvaux (1090 - 1153), the same Bernard who had been personally responsible for obtaining the papal rul e for the Knights Templar. There were profound links between Bernard‘s monastic order, the Cistercians, and the Nasoreans, who fought and died for Jerusalem in AD 70. The Cistercians wore white robes, as did the Nasoreans, and so to did the Knights Templar before adding their red cross - Philip Gardiner and Gary Osborn ( The Serpent Grail ) ◊ ◊ ◊ From The Warriors and the Bankers by Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe In this fine book on Templar history, the authors deal with three crucial areas that have given ri se to much controversy.

He was in league with the weak Pope Clement V, who resided not in Rome but in Avignon, France. Owing to the weakness and irresolution of Pope Clement, the royal plan succeeded. After an unsuccessful attempt of the Pope (in Aug ust, 1307) to unite the Templars and the Hospitallers, he yielded to the demands of King Philip and ordered an investigation of the order, against which the king brought charges of heresy - (page 15) Clement V (1264 - 1314) Philip IV (1268 - 1314) The Templar and Rosicrucian Connection Templar gr aves have been found in several sites in Palestine which contain a carved effigy of a warrior's sword, which itself is a cruciform shape, around which are entwined roses - (page 54) ...the route taken by the rose into Templar beliefs probably owes a great deal to a pre - Christian deity called 'Rosemerth,' who was worshipped in Lorraine (now a part of France) since time out of mind. It was at her shrine, Sion Vaudemont, that the Virgin Mary was first named 'Queen of Heaven,' a theme that St. Bernard of Clairv aux took up some 60 years later. St. Bernard influenced the Vatican to offer Mary this position officially - (page 54 - 55) ...the common dog rose (Rosa Canina) is rare among plants in that it does not have to be cross - fertilized to produce its fruit, the ro sehip. In this sense the rose is capable of virgin birth, and it seems unlikely that this potential was lost on our distant ancestors - (page 55) ...the first time that the Rose Cross was mentioned in conjunction with a contemporary and espoused religious belief was in the early part of the 17th century, when a series of"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"documents known as the 'Rosicrucian Manifestos' began to circulate in Western Europe.

For a while the Catholic forces made great gains and Protestant sympathizers flocked out of Europe, but especially to Holland, to find refuge in England. Many of them were aided in their flight by a quasi - Masonic - type ins titution known as 'The Christian Unions.' The main organizer of these clandestine brotherhoods was Andrea, also supposedly author of the Rosicrucian Manifestos - (page 55) Luther and the Rosicrucians It is extremely doubtful whether the first stirrings of rebellion against the Catholic Church, again propagated by a German, Martin Luther, of the 16th century, could ever have become the raging force for reform that it proved to be in the following century, without the bravery and persistence of men and women who held Rosicrucian ideals - (page 58) The Invisible College Rosicrucian ideals grew apace and nowhere more so than in Britain, though it is impossible to assert that ideas such as these were anything out of the ordinary to a particular section of societ y in Britain at the time. A specific group of early Freemasons, most of whom also enjoyed Rosicrucian leanings, had already formed themselves into a fraternity called 'The Invisible College,' which began meeting in the middle years of the 1640s...Most of t he first members of the Royal Society were either known Rosicrucians, or else were staunch supporters of similar beliefs - (page 58) Templarism and Freemasonry ...According to the United Grand Lodge of England, Freemasonry began in 1717 with the formation of Grand Lodge, whereas the Knights Templar were disbanded and dissolved not so long after the 1307 persecutions of King Philip IV of France. It follows therefore that there was a gap of four full centuries between the last Templar and the first Freemason. ..any person who has looked at the issues carefully must first come to the conclusions that not only did the Knights Templar, in one form or another, very definitely survive beyond 1307, but that Freemasonry, on one form or another, significantly pre - dates the 18th century - (page 71) Freemasons do not consist of one cohesive body, centrally run and all - encompassing. The Masonic fraternity consists of the individual members who gather in individual Lodges. These Lodges are, in turn, governed by a Grand Lodg e.

There are elite lodges with Protestant nobles and royals, and lodges were the members are primarily Catholic, like P2. And although Masons are meant to believe in the brotherhood of all men, white lodges, particularly tho se of upper class members, rarely if ever allow Blacks or Asians to become members. Not only does the fraternity owe its existence to Templarism, the fraternity seems to loudly proclaim it in a number of ways...the Masonic body known as York Rite contains three sub - groups called Capitular, Cryptic and Chivalric Masonry. These three bodies of the York Rite are perhaps better known...as The Royal Arch, Cryptic Rite and Knights Templar. It is this latter branch that smacks of Templarism, containing the Chival ric distinctions of Illustrious Order of the Red Cross, Knight of Malta, and Order of the Temple (Knights Templar). These Chivalric Masons meet in Preceptories or Commanderies generally named after heroes of the Crusades, for example 'King Baldwin Precepto ry' - (page 72) The homage to Templarism does not end here for modern Freemasonry, as even its group for young men is called de Molay after the martyr of the Knights Templar - ibid Scottish Masonry If we assert, as we must do, that Freemasonry is originall y a Scottish peculiarity, we must, of course, support our belief with proof and this proof starts with the Masonic guilds. Guilds of operative masons had existed since early medieval times not only in Scotland but all over Europe. These fraternities were s omething of a mixture between a trade organization and a trade union, bent of protecting the interests of those participating in a particular trade - (page 73) The Sinclairs ...as early as 1441 James II, who was King of Scotland at the time, appointed the St. Clair (Sinclair) family as patrons and protectors of Scottish masons. The King made this a hereditary office and declared that annual meetings would be held in Kilwinning, Scotland. This early date roughly coincides with the building of Rosslyn Chapel, near Edinburgh, and it is upon the bastion of this sturdy little Gothic masterpiece that so many claims for the origins of speculative Freemasonry rest - (page 73 - 74) ...it has been suggested that Hugh de Payens, the first Grand Master of the Templar Orde r, was married to a St. Clair heiress. There is no doubt that the St. Clairs are of French origin, or that St. Clair eventually became Sinclair - (page 76) The earliest Scottish reference to a 'speculative' Lodge of Freemasons comes from...a charter of 159 8...well over a century before Grand Lodge in London was formed.

The Howards had been tremendously powerful in England or centuries, having been, since the days of Richard III, the Dukes of Norfolk...one branch of the family, headed by a noted turncoat and political opportunis t by the name of Charles, ultimately became Dukes of Carlisle...There they intermarried with the D'acre and Greystoke families, gaining vast estates in Yorkshire, to add to those in Cumberland - (page 81) The Third Earl of Carlisle, another Charles, fell o ut with his political contemporaries in the North West, and decided to build a fantastic new seat, close to York.

And there is little doubt that this branch of the Howard family have been staunch Freemas ons up to the present day. In fact, even before this section of the Howard family split from its Norfolk counterparts, it is known that the Dukes of Norfolk were early Freemasons - (page 82) The Dukes of Carlisle were Protestant by inclination. it is there fore highly likely that Charles, though a keen Mason, would have wished to distance himself from Freemasonry, many of the members of which were plotting the return of the Stuart monarchs. As a result it seems highly likely that Charles Howard was instrumen tal in either taking Freemasonry to York and replaced the Stuart affiliation with one based on early Anglo - Saxon history, which showed England as superior to Scotland and he avowed Christianity to lie at the center of the York Rite - (page 82) Replete as i t is with Christian symbolism, York Rite Freemasonry still espouses Templar beliefs - probably to a greater extent than any other branch of Freemasonry - and in this regard it is representative of the Sinclair's earlier, Scottish, Freemasonry - (page 83) W e have shown that Templarism has been endemic to Freemasonry from its inception, long before the formation of Grand Lodge in London.

Moreover, the Order of Sion's charter was signed by a Lodge in Switzerland. (See Irish Origins , Volume Two).

The Bible: An Irish Book by Conor MacDari Introduction The great researcher into the occult history of anc ient Ireland, Mr. Conor MacDari, wrote two books which have long been suppressed. These book are entitled: Irish Wisdom Preserved in Bible and Pyramids and The Bible: An Irish Book : On this page we provide some excerpts from the latter tome: The Destructio n of the Irish (Aryan) World Church Rome waged war against the Irish Church colony at Carthage, in North Africa, Spain, Gaul, Britain, Eire and Germany. She seemed to have grasped the idea early that her successful progress to power could be only through t he conq u est and acquisition of the Irish Church...This warlike spirit, aroused by Rome in the eleventh century, was not allowed to subside in the twelfth and was directed against Eire. As England was Roman Church territory, in due time the cr u sading spirit of conquest in the interest of the church was directed to that country. The Pope of that day, Adrian IV, an Englishman, who had been ch o sen pope on the strength of the probability of his being able to induce the E n glish to attack Eire and bring the Irish Church under the sway of the Roman Pontiff, succeeded in enlisting King Henry II of England to undertake the co n quest of Eire in the interest of the Roman Church. For this purpose the Pope issued a Bull authorizing Henry to take possession of the country T he story of the Roman Church is quite different and not a pleasant one to dwell upon. She made her advance through the medium of intrigue, war, fire and sword, persecution, torture, confiscations, and death, the exemplification of force and intolerance. By such means she gained control and increase in power and the Irish Church missionaries were gradually forced to withdraw from the continent. It was only by such forcible means that she could make gains against the Irish Church whose representatives surpass ed hers in every field of peaceful endeavor...in learning, the sciences, philosophy and spiritual culture No doubt the clerical scribes who translated and revised the ancient Irish text felt satisfied that, with the Irish language and culture suppressed an d destro y ed, no one in a future age would be able to discover the deception which was perpetrated in telling the Christian world that the Scriptures were obtained from a tribe of so - called Hebrew people who lived in a desert and mountainous country in Asia , now called Syria. But, as fate would have it, the deception was not destined to go undiscovered "},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"Destruction of the Irish Culture The efforts, then, appear ridiculous of obscurantists who, by the destruction of literary works, interpolations and forgeri es, have endeavored to make it appear that Irish culture and learning did not antedate the sixth century AD. This was done for the pirposse of making it appear that the beginnings of Irish culture and learning took place some time after the fictitious date which had been set as the advent into Ireland of the spurious Roman St. Patrick This claim is too absurd today, as we know that up to the date assigned to \"Patrick\" Rome had been engaged in a crusade of destruction against all lea r ning, books, literature, libraries and culture for a period of at least one hundred years. The libraries of Alexandria had been destroyed about the year 395 or 400 AD. It is certain that whatever literature or learning there was in Greece or in Italy or the adjoining provinces at the time were destroyed The Roman Church, in her endeavor to blot out the history of the past ages in order to conceal a great deception, destroyed whatever she may have had of literature, and, since her acquisition of the Irish Church and institutions, s he has appropriated the names and works of Irish authors to enrich her reputation for learning and culture and to build up a fictitious galaxy of distinguished sons to ornament her escutcheon. In short, the history of Rome is largely fiction Murderous Alli es of Evil The success of the invading force in Eire was aided greatly by the Norman French colony under the leadership of Richard de Clair (Strongbow), which had been planned in Ireland about one hundred years previously, instituting what is known in our day as the \"policy of peaceful penetration.\" As the barb a rous Norse and Danes centuries before had been instigated by Rome to war on territory occupied by the Irish Church, it was natural that Duke William of Normandy, of that same racial stock, would be a n ally of Rome. He was urged by the pope of his day to attack England in the interest of his church, the se c ret reason being that the Roman Church could not compete with the Irish Church in England as the Irish were the master scholars of Europe and their spiritual culture, instruction and learning were once more becoming dominant in England, and something had to be done to keep that country under the p o wer of Rome...Duke William invaded England in 1066 AD, and four years later, in the year 1070, a body of seventy knights, adventurers, went to Eire, took part in a quarrel between a provincial king and prince and settled there. They formed marriage alliances with many of the leading families and were the first units sent into the country to prepare the way fo r the successful invasion of the Island a century later under Henry II of England The Irish Pope This conquest and absorption of the Irish Church was...the most important and momentous event in the whole history of the Roman Church, an event which has chan ged and affected the entire course of subsequent history even to this day.

It was only in the monastic establishments maintained at different points on the continent by the monks of the Irish Church that learne d men w e re to be found. There were practically no learned men in the Roman Church at that time. Even a century later when the Emperor Charlemagne espoused the cause of the Roman Church, he had to get Irish schoolmen for instructors to teach in the palace s chool which he established. Ireland and Germany While it is acknowledged that the renaissance of learning on the continent of Europe in the early medieval period was due to Irish instruction and culture, this acknowledgement comes only in outspoken candor from German rather than from British or Roman sources. These latter have endeavored to minimize the work of the Irish philosophers, schoolmen, and monks and their lea r ning and culture. No Part of the Crusades It will be noted that Eire (Ireland) took no pa rt in the wars of the Crusades, a strange thing if she belonged to the Roman Church...The very absence of the Irish from the crusading forces tells the story in itself and is significant evide n ce that they did not belong to and were not affiliated in any w ay with the Roman Church at that time, 1096 - 1099 AD...The fact is, of course, that the Roman Church was an enemy and was at war against the Irish Church and n a tion."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Bible Off Limits Even in England, until a late date, comparatively speaking, the Bible was kept exclusively for the clergy. John Wycliff translated a part of the Bible and pe r secuted by the clergy, and his life was ever in danger afterwards. In 1378, he was brought to trial. One of the charges brought against him was that he made the Bible more \"common and more open to lay men and women than it was wont to be to clerks well learned and of good understanding, so that the pearl of the gospel is trodden under foot of swine.\" When Wycliff died in 1384, a monk denounced him and said that he was \"the i dol of heretics, the image of hypocrites, the restorer of schisms, the storehouse of lies, the sink of flattery\" and all this was because he helped to give the laity an English version of the Bible The first complete English version of the Bible was publis hed on the basis of Tyndale's translation and appeared in England in 1535, one year before Ty n dale's death. So it was at a very late date that the English people were given the Bible. Tyndale had to flee from England and, after traveling about from place t o place on the continent of Europe, he was arrested in Antwerp where, after one year of imprisonment, he was strangled to death in his cell. It was only in 1538 that, in response to the clamor of the people for the Bible, King Henry VIII issued a command t o all ministers to place \"one boke of of the wh o le Bible, in Englyshe, sett up in summe convenyent place within the churche that ye have cure of, whereat your parishioners may most commodiously r e sort to the same and rede it.\" This Bible was chained to a b lock or other fixture so that no one could carry it away.

This falsification was a deception promulgated by Constantine th e Great in 325 AD, at the Church Council of Nicea. The Church then carried on a conspiracy to protect the deception in order to guarantee its dictatorial rule over the Empire, and built a new city of Jerusalem in the Mediterranean. The Role of Saturn Anoth er shocker for me was the role Beaumont assigned to the planet Saturn, as the key to world history. Thoroughly intrigued, I searched for the true and the false in his basic ideas. Beaumont‘s books, unlike V‘s, however, were long relegated to library morgu es, and it took much persistence to acquire them. After considerable transatlantic correspondence and telephoning, I located one of Beaumont‘s daughters and a real treasure trove of information – an unpublished manuscript that Beaumont completed before his death...Beaumont was ahead of his time – and ahead of Velikovsky – with his provocative conclusions and his unorthodox views on history. According to Beaumont, a large comet threatened Earth in the 14 th century (1322 BC). Its debris (meteorites) caused a co smic catastrophe that devastated early civilization, then centred in the Atlantis of antiquity – the British Isles. Plato‘s story of Atlantis, and the Biblical account of the flood of Noah, were special attempts to record this disaster. The catastrophe so shattered the cradle of humankind‘s earliest civilization that it immutably altered the religious beliefs of its survivors, who fled to the global Atlantean colonies in sunnier climes, themselves to become nations. Beaumont was an improbable heretic. In th e years before and after WW I, he was a top - flight journalist, editor, and publisher on London‘s famed Fleet Street, dealing primarily with politics, the arts and society. he was well connected in these fields due to his early work as assistant to publisher - diplomat James Gordon Bennett. As private secretary to America‘s U.S. Ambassador to Germany, John G. A. Leishman, he traveled to many countries, acquainted himself with their customs and histories."},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"He was confident and brother - in - law to the British playwr ight and theatrical producer Gerald Du Maurier. Beaumont was the first to recognize and publish the fiction of his talented niece, Daphne Du Maurier. A consummate establishment insider, Beaumont passionately pursued a parallel maverick career, developing i deas that challenged orthodoxy without relying on any of the divine intervention that is the backbone of contemporary Creationism and Biblical catastrophism. His ideas challenge accepted views of ancient history, its chronology, and its geography. The Effe cts of Comets The crux of Beaumont‘s schema is that the history of our planet, and the solar system within which it exists, is largely the product of cometary intrusions and their effects. Its social life (civilization) arose with the Celts in the north, e specially in the British Isles and Scandinavia – the Atlantis of myth. Although there was no actual sinking of Atlantis – Britain, some of its western areas were permanently submerged and the island was ravaged by electromagnetic waves of cosmic energy, ex ploding volcanoes, earthquakes, hurricane storms, and tidal waves. As a result of the catastrophe, the temperature dropped. Beaumont identifies the main agent of this historical event as the planet Saturn (Zeus - Chronos) becoming a comet, in myth, the serpe nt of the sky, and Phaeton, the terror of the skies. Its ravaged body produced a son, a new planet = a new sky god, Jupiter (a new Zeus), to rule a renewed Earth. Beaumont Predates Velikovsky Those familiar with the writings of Immanuel Velikovsky might we ll lock onto certain key features in Beaumont‘s corpus and conclude, perhaps with a dismissive yawn, ―Oh, Beaumont agrees with Velikovsky.‖ But ―agrees with‖ is hardly the case. Note that Beaumont‘s primary work in catastrophism, although under the pseudon ym Appian W ay, was published in 1925. He used his own name in 1932 on his second book, the keystone to his catastrophist theories. The book‘s contents are aptly summed up by its subtitle: ―The Origin, Building Up and Destruction of W orlds by Means of Comet ary Contacts.‖ By the end of WWII (he was then in his 70s), Beaumont‘s journalism career was over and he began work on distilling his theories of catastrophism and even more revolutionary conclusions about history and geography."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Beaumont‘s next to books, t he first and second volumes of his trilogy, followed rapidly (1946, 1949). Neither were commercial successes. Beaumont completed the third volume before his death in 1953. Again note that all but the last of these books were published before V‘s Worlds in Collision made its impact on this side of the Atlantic in 1950. In the years I was closely associated with V (roughly 1961 - 1969), he never mentioned Beaumont or gave him so much as a credit in a footnote in any of his books. The similarities between Beaumo nt and Velikovsky are too strong to be coincidental. It is Saturn‘s role in earliest history that provides Beaumont a ―smoking gun‖ for this judgment. Velikovsky Knew of Beaumont There are, however, a number of cases of parallel development of ideas on rec ord. Perhaps the most famous is that involving Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell W allace, who both independently developed the main features of what has become known as the Theory of Evolution in the nineteenth century. It therefore came as a shock when I finally discovered that V did indeed know of Beaumont‘s earlier work. The disclosure came with the publication of Cosmic Heretics by Alfred deGrazia in 1984. DeGrazia was long one of V‘s closest collaborators and friends, and a continuing acquaintance and correspondent of mine dating from my own contact with V. In his book, deGrazia wrote: Too many of Beaumont‘s conclusions are the same to explain them as sheer coincidence...A note exists in his archive, mentioning having read Beaumont‘s 1932 book (The Myste rious Comet); the note dismisses the work. Yet V expresses his wonder whether Beaumont had gotten his (V‘s) ideas by telepathy. DeGrazia tries to ameliorate the situation with a tenuous explanation: During the 1940s, V met with the (Beaumont) books at Colu mbia University Library where he spend thousands of hours in research on his own books. The Columbia University Library possessed of Beaumont‘s relevant works only The Riddle of Prehistoric Britain which was published in 1946. By this time Worlds in Collis ion had been written."},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"DeGrazia also wrote: Velikovsky never mentioned or cited Beaumont. Could Velikovsky have read and forgotten Beaumont‘s books? His method of proof is entirely different; practically everything – style, format, language, method, and evi dence – is different, only conclusions are the same. DeGrazia‘s candor in revealing the link is admirable, but his apologetics leave a lot to be desired in terms of credibility. Telepathy? I wonder if that happy thought crossed Darwin‘s mind. Forgotten? Ev eryone who knew V, deGrazia included, has attested that V had a remarkable memory. What about the claim that V‘s research haunt, the Columbia University Library, contained only Beaumont‘s 1946 book, and that the manuscript for Worlds in Collusion was alrea dy complete at that time. Even deGrazia admits that there was a note that V had read Beaumont‘s seminal 1932 book. And V was well known as the last - minute tinkered with his manuscripts. Plagiarism and Predecessors I am not claiming there is actual plagiari sm involved, other than influence and interplay of ideas. (Advocates of cometary catastrophe in historic times all owe a dept to earlier pioneers such Ignatius Donnelly and W illiam W histon.) Let us also admit that, like many from academia, V had an elitis t mindset, hindering him from appreciating the work of the amateur. Enough here, at least, to withhold credit and precedence. This much is certain. Beaumont‘s ideas on the importance of comets in humankind‘s history were in print before Velikovsky‘s – alth ough in a foreign country and without achieving the temporary popular success that was to be Velikovsky‘s. Especially apparent, thanks to deGrazia‘s revelations, is that V was aware of Beaumont‘s work. V‘s belief in his own originality was so firmly rooted that he speculated that telepathy was enabling Beaumont to rush into print – by decades in some cases. There is an even more intriguing possible reason for V‘s failure to acknowledge the existence of Beaumont. This is not the similarities but the many di ssimilarities between the writers. W hy call attention to a contemporary (until his death in 1953) who not only precedes you in areas of agreement but disagrees with you on many other points? But that is speculation."},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"What is clear is that forty years after his death, Beaumont deserves a wider audience in an era when fresh evidence for catastrophism is steadily accumulating. An important element of Beaumont‘s work that will endure and serve to remind us is that the pursuit of knowledge is not the exclusive of the expert. The amateur can contribute significantly to that pursuit. For the last twenty years I have accumulated evidence to support Beaumont‘s perspective of ancient history as truer than the consensus version or Velikovsky‘s. - (Article in Fate Magazi ne, March 1994) ◊ ◊ ◊ Relevant Websites Immanuel Velikovsky: Bonds of the Past Documentary Velikovsky: Worlds in Collision Velikov sky: Earth in Upheaval Velikovsky: Ages in Chaos Velikovsky: Oedipus and Akhenaton Carl Sagan and Immanuel Velikovsky Comyns Beaumont: The Riddle of Prehistoric Britain Comyns Beaumont: The Mysterious Comet Comyns Beaumont: Britain: The Key to World History "},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 6 .

These edicts were devastating to Egyptian culture and religion, both of which had been preserved over millennia through the Egyptian language and the writing systems of Egyptian priests. In 39 1 C.E. the Patriarch of Alexandria, Theophilus, summoned the monks to arms and turned them against the city of Memphis and the great shrine of Serapis, the Serapeum, the main temple of the Osirian - Isis religion.

Yes, they knew the truth, and so do their descendants. It is time, therefore, that we too understood where the motifs originated and what they mean. Heavenly Serpents The student of mythology would do we ll to consider the astral or cosmic origins of serpent symbolism. Many ancient mythologies, and many god - like characters who appear in world myth, owe their existence to cosmic disasters that occurred in our solar system and which were witnessed by the inh abitants of the Earth. The cataclysmic events (involving comets and exploding planets) were permanently archived in what we nowadays refer to as the \"collective unconscious.\" They were deeply etched in the racial memory of all mankind. Throughout the ages they have been colorfully, and often obliquely, rendered in various mythological accounts and bizarre faerie tales that have perplexed and enthralled so many readers. The legends that speak of celestial upheaval, and of gods and deities with fantastic stre ngth, power, and luminance, make a great deal more sense when we read them aright.

The Old and New Testamen ts To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God – (Revelation 2:7) The tropes of Judaism and Christianity are largely based on earlier pagan traditions.

In other words, there are many references, both cryptic and obvious, to the stars and luminaries.

In light of this, Christians and Jews should spend time reviewing the tenets of their religions. They should ask probing questions of their priests, pastors, and rabbis, and press them to explain the existence of pagan symbolism in the architecture an d holy books. Better still, they should go to the experts who spent their lives uncovering the truth about the origins of religious imagery: The two trees in the Garden of Eden can be accounted for upon Egyptian ground, but on no other; one being the tree of the pole in the stellar mythos, the other the tree of life or of dawn in the garden eastward. The two typical trees are recognizable as Egyptian in the Book of the Dead. In one chapter (97th) they are called the two divine sycamores of heaven and earth . The sycamore of heaven is identified as the tree of Nut. It stands in the ―lake of equipoise,‖ which is at the celestial pole. The tree of earth is the tree of Hathor and of dawn. Atum - Ra, the solar god, is also described as coming forth from betwixt the two trees...The tree of earth, or Hathor, and the tree of heaven, or Nut, were brought on together and united in the tree of burial for the mummy.

The first letter of Jehovah can legitimately be rendered \"Y\" or \"J.\" (These three letters are interchangeable in Hebrew. Numerologically, they each represent the number 1 or 10). The letter Yod/Iod/Jod, is conspicuously ithyphallic. In Hebrew script the letter is erect and does represent the male member. This implicit phallicism is accepted by rabbis and students of Judaism. Jehovah, after all, is a purely male, consortless entity. His prophets and champions are likewise male. It is not a surprise that Jehovah makes his first appearance in the form of a tree.

The Kabalists imagined spiritual wisdom to descend in form of a blazing lightening flash. In other words, what we read about in Exodus can be deciphered by a study of Kabalistic lore. The burnin g bush is the illuminated Tree of Life. In Kabalism, spiritual instruction descends as a lightening flash and reaches the mind of man. This is the true meaning of the scene in Exodus.

The yew tree was one of the most sacred of all trees in Druidism.

When Christianity was introduced, pagan sacred sites were o ften converted into Christian sacred sites – Alexander Stewart ( A Highland Parish or the History of Fortingall , 1928) Interestingly, the most sacred Egyptian groves, orchards, and temple precincts appear to have had these Irish yews in pride of place. Acco rding to Ralph Ellis, the yew was the Egyptian‘s original ‖Tree of Life,‖ and it featured prominently in Egypt‘s most sacred mystery school traditions and initiatory rites. It was a symbol of death and underworld rites. The oldest implements in the world, dating to over fifty thousand years ago, were made of yew wood. The tree may have been considered sacred because it poisoned all animals that ate of its bark or leaves except the stag and deer. The deer and stag were supremely sacred to the Irish Druids. T he yew can still be found in British churchyards. Given that the yews are older than Christian churches, it follows that Christian churches and cathedrals were deliberately positioned near to the tree for symbolic purposes. A study of the yew tree serves t o confirm the W est to East movement of the elements of religion. As we mentioned above, the last letter of the Irish Ogham alphabet - ‖I‖ - signified the yew tree. The letter, identical to the Hebrew Yod, is the first letter in the name of the Judeo - Christ ian god (Jehovah or Yahweh). It is also the initial letter of Juda, which comes from Yahuda or Yahud.

But as kings were represented by a substitute, so the sacred tree, regarded as too sacred to be cut down, may also have had its succedaneum. The Irish bile or sacred tree, connected w ith the kings, must not be touched by any impious hand, and it was sacrilege to cut it down – J. A.

Remsberg ( The Christ ) In the works of Greek and Latin writers we hear repeatedly of sacred woods and groves, sanctuaries in forest clearings and on hilltops, beside springs and lakes and on islands, and of places set apart for the burial of the noble dead – H. R. Ellis Davidson ( Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions ) Elohim and the Elm The sacred tree, or tree of life, so universally recognized in eastern systems of theology, is called to mind; and we are naturally led to refer the traditions connected with it to a common origin – Austen Henry Layard ( Nineveh and its Remains , 1849) Early Christians and Jews were divided into several competing groups. There were those who believed in one god, Jehovah, and those who believed in a plurality of gods known as the Elohim. Of course, this word is often taken for the name of a particular god. But this is not the case. The word is plural . In fact, as we showed in ou r book Astro - Theology and Sidereal Mythology , the Elohim were based on the nine creator gods of the Amenists, headed by Ptah. Ptah is Ju - pitar or Jupiter of the Romans (Zeus of the Greeks), and Dis Pater of the Celts. He is found in the Bible as Saint Pete r (Petra), the rock upon which Christ establishes his Church. Again, the symbolism of paganism turns up in the iconography of Christianity. Trees are repeatedly mentioned in the Old and New Testaments, and in the scriptures of various pagan nations. The T ree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil mentioned in Genesis, the burning bush in which the angel appeared to Moses, the famous vine and fig tree of the New Testament, the grove of olives in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus went to p ray, and the miraculous tree of Revelation, which bore twelve manners of fruit and whose leaves were for the healing of the nations, all bear witness to the esteem in which trees were held by the scribes of Holy Writ. Buddha received his illumination while under the bodhi tree, near Madras in India, and several of the Eastern gods are pictured sitting in meditation beneath the spreading branches of mighty trees.

However, as we said, it meant more than one god. The word is a corruption of the Hebrew Aleim or Alim, which can be correctly rendered Elm . The elm, ash, and oak (as we ll as the rowan, yew, pine, myrrh, myrtle, acacia, olive, almond, fig, and palm) were sacred to the adepts and kings of the ancient world. The myrtle performed the same office of symbolism in the Mysteries of Greece as the lotus did in Egypt, or the mistl etoe among the Druids. The candidate, in these initiations, was crowned with myrtle, because, according to the popular theology, the myrtle was sacred to Proserpine, the goddess of the future life - Albert A. Mackey ( The Symbolism of Freemasonry ) Ra was known as Khepri when he rose as the sun in the morning. He was Atum when he set in east at night. The hieroglyph of his name was LA or LE which, when reversed as AL or EL, became the hieroglyph for the eye of Horus. (Note the two eyes above Ra.)

Male gods, such as Horus, were agents of Ma'at, that is, of justice and rightness. The Christian mythmongers transmogrified Horus and Ma'at into Jesus and Mary. They also plagiarized the Wisdom Texts of Egypt and presented that wisdom as their own in the Old and New Testaments. Actually, the Books of the Torah and the New Testament's Gospels and Epistles, etc, are pathetically anemic revisions of the originals that have recently come to light.

Ben Hur (\"High Man\" or \"H igh Sun\"), is on his way home after a painful visit with his mother and sister who have been confined to a leper colony. He comes across a great multitude gathering to hear Jesus speaking from the \"mount.\" Now curiously, all the way through the film, the t opography has been typically arid, that is, barren and sandy, as one would expect to find in most parts of Palestine, Galilee, and Judea. Suddenly, in this scene, for no apparent reason, the appearance of the topography dramatically changes. We see green f ields filled with leafy trees and a flowing river from which Ben stoops to quench his thirst. We also see the hills of a type found in Britain , not Judea or Galilee. "},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":" Suddenly, a strange man appears. He recognizes Ben and walks eagerly toward him. He is Saint Paul and he has come to h ear his master give his sermon on the mount. However, the actor chosen to play the apostle has the appearance of a Westerner , in fact, a Druid. He is dressed in purple and white, the colors of the Druids, and carries a staff. He walks through the verdant l and, across the bridge toward the mount and although we are not consciously aware of it, we are in merry ol' England, not Palestine. We are at Silbury Hill or Glastonbury Tor, not the Sea of Galilee. That, at least, is what the makers of the movie symbolic ally imply. Interestingly, Ben Hur's cloak has the appearance of Irish or Scottish tartan. In this context, the scene is uncannily similar to one that occurs toward the end of the recent blockbuster movie The Da Vinci Code , when Sophie (Sophia/Mary) stands in the grounds of Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland (on the Rose Line) wrapped in Scottish tartan. Let us recall that Scota, the daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaton, gave her name to the land of Scotland.

Again, the topography is distinctly English in appearance. Looking on are eight members of the tribes of Israel.

Lets take close look at a few scenes in this fascinating movie: In an early scene we see King Saul on his death bed, speaking to his son Solomon. On Solomon's armor we see the symbol of the sun. He is about to inherit the mantle from his father, who, sidereally speaking, is the old and dying sun. (Solomon's brother and rival is Adonijah , a nam e that is a combination of Adon or Aton, and Jah for Jehovah/Yahweh. The name Solomon is clearly a reference to the sun and moon. It is, however, a variant of the Latin word Sol and the Egyptian word Amon . The latter word is the name of the most ancient su n god. He was worshiped almost exclusively by Egyptian high priests and royals. Atum Ra was worshiped publically.) In the following scenes we find that Saul (Sol) has regained enough strength to address his people concerning his legacy. He wishes to let them know about Solomon's succession to the throne of Israel. But what's this? We find that the actor chosen to depict Saul is the same Briti sh actor who played Paul in Ben Hur . What is more, he is yet again dressed in the colors of the Druids. In fact, he wears the colors of each division of the Druidic Order. Blue signified the Ovates or Poets.

There is really nothing surprising about this when we realize that every name of the twelve tribes is of Irish origin.

On of the most important scenes involves a startling revelation concerning the physiognomy of Egyptian royal ty... After Moses is expelled from Egypt, he takes refuge with a shepherd by the name of Jethro - referred to as a priest of Midian - who lived nea r Mount Sinai. His eldest daughter Zipporah (meaning \"bird\") falls in love with Moses, and seeking to ingratiate herself with him and appear attractive in his eyes, remarks enviously but poetically on the beauty and elegance of Egyptian women. The movie's dialogue is as follows: \"She was very beautiful wasn't she, this woman of Egypt who left her scar upon your heart? Her skin was as white as curd, her eyes green as the cedars of Lebanon, her lips tamarisk honey...like the breast of a dove, her arms were so ft, and the wine of love was in her veins...\" Clearly, the movie moguls know something most don't about the racial origins of the Pharaohs. This particular scene cryptically reveals many important facts about Moses and the Israelites, as does the Old Testa ment account itself. For example, the name Jethro means \"His Excellence,\" and thereby implies royalty. Additionally, Mount Sinai is a simulacra for the Great Pyramid at Giza and the \"Wilderness\" connotes a period of ritual asceticism undergone by high prie sts of Egypt. Most importantly, the term \"shepherd\" is a indirect reference to the Hyksos dynasty of Pharaohs to which Moses (or more correctly Akhenaton) belonged. Interestingly, the Quran deems Jethro to have been a member of the \"Druze\" people. This ter m, believed to mean anything from \"those who read\" to \"mountain dweller,\" is probably derived from a term denoting the ancient Druids who frequented the Middle East in ages past. "},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"Another vital revelation in the movie concerns the royal identity of the s o - called Israelites or Jews... In the ea rly scenes of the film, we see Moses' Egyptian mother, a princess, coming across the basket of reeds in which Moses lies. When she removes the infant, her maid notices that the child has been wrapped in a piece of cloth from a Levite cloak. She remarks on its presence and asks why it was around the child. The princess responds as follows: \"If my son is covered in it, it is a royal robe.\" Her servant then exclaims: \"Royal?...It's the Levite cloth of a Hebrew slave!\" She continues to say: \"I will not see you make this son of slaves "},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"a prince of Egypt.\" The princess confidently responds by saying: \"...we'll see...you will see him walk with his head among the eagles.\" During this revealing scene, the princess is also heard to say: \"I am the Pharaoh's daughter and my son shall be reared in my house as Prince of the Two Lands.\" In this particular scene we have been told, albeit obliquely, that Moses and the Levites were pharaonic . They were royalty in the land of Egypt, not oppressed slaves. We have been told that M oses was a \"eagle,\" that is, a high - ranking priest - king of Egypt. Our god is made to take all forms as a ―consuming fire,‖ a ―still small voice,‖ and all through his early worship until the reign of Hezekiah he was worshipped as the serpent Nehushtan which Moses had made in the wilderness (II Kings 18:4) – John Martin Woolsey ( Symbolic Mythology ) In the Old Testament Book of Exodus, we read that Moses erected a \"B razen Standard\" in the wilderness, after leaving Egypt with the \"Chosen People.\" This act clearly defines Moses as a Pharaoh, or of Pharaonic descent. His Israelites were a powerful dynasty within Egypt, whose desecration and megalomania compelled the peop le to rise up against them. When Moses and Aaron come to negotiate with the Pharaoh, we also hear of rods and snakes. As we will see later, the staff and snake represents, among other things, the polar axis of the earth. Left: The serpent standard was a sy mbol of Egyptian priest - kings. The Uraeus wears the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. In the scene mentioned above, from the Ten Commandments , the princess said that she will raise Moses to be a Prince of the Two Lands. In other words, Moses was a Ser pent Prince."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"Another movie with equally important subtextual references to the true origins of Judeo - Christianity, is the 1951 epic Quo Vadis. The title, meaning \"where are you going,\" was derived from a passage in the Acts of Peter in the New Testament. In one of the most important scenes, Saint Peter, while walking on the Appian "},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"Way outside Rome, hears the voice of Jesus instructing him to return to Rome and attend to the plight of the Israelites there who are being persecuted by the Emperor Nero. However, in the movie's rendition of the B iblical passage, St. Paul hears the voice of Jesus coming from a tree. What is more, the actor chosen to play Saint Peter is yet again Findlay Currie. And yet again he is attired in the fashion of a High Druid. The dialogue in this scene is as follows: \"Th ese tree - tops there, do they not bend with the wind...and that sudden brightness coming...it is the light of the Lord.\" While kneeling to listen to the voice of Jesus, St. Peter rests his staff, which looks remarkably like an Pharaonic crook, up against a large oak.

Were the film makers attempting to emphasize something important about the staff and tree at the very end of the ir movie? After all, what is the rod or staff that has serpentine vines coiled about it? In another important scene, the hero Marcus Vinicius, Tribune of Rome, rides triumphantly into the great city after returning from successful conquests in the East. He salutes Emperor Nero and we see that he is literally \"crowned\" with thorns, that is, with laurel leaves. ( Here for more information.) "},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":" These examples come from a few scenes in a mere three films. W e could analyze hundreds of movies in the same manner and gain profound insight into the truth about the pagan origins of Judeo - Christianity. For instance, in the movie Star Trek V: The Final Frontier , when the protagonists are seconds away from an encounter with a Jehovah - like god, they are first surrounded by ithyphallic pylons that erupt violently from under the earth to enclose them. These stone s appear identical in form to those erected by the ancient worshipers of Priapas, Bel, Cronus, Yahweh, and other earth gods. Is it just by chance that the movie makers decided to use these time - honored images? W e don't believe so. In the movie, the pro tagonists finally locate \"God\" at the very center of the universe, that is, at \"Galactic Center.\" Many nations and races have elaborate myths and legends that pertain to this region of space. The gods and shaman of the Maya, for example, had to ascend a \"t ree\" to reach the door in the center of the galaxy, whereas in Egyptian myths, the god or hero travels on a barque (boat) to the location. Of course, the phrase \"center of the galaxy or universe\" may subtextually refer to the circumpolar region. (More on t hat later.) In chapter eighteen of the Book of Genesis, we read that Jehovah comes to visit the aged prophet Abraham and his wife Sarah. A few minutes after god is seated and fed in the \"tent\" of Abraham, three other visitors arrive. They are clearly extra ordinary beings and Abraham promptly bows before them. They ask for water and sit near a tree. Reading the lines, we are alerted by the references to three travelers and to the tree beneath which they rest. We also note the similarity of these anecdotes to those in the Gospel of Matthew which tell of the three wise men or Magi who allegedly follow the \"star in the east\" to the stable where Jesus was born. In both cases, the imagery involved is both Druidic and sidereal: And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"toward the ground, And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; afte r that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal...And he took butter, and milk, and the cal f which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat Abraham and his three angelic guest s, sitting in the shade of the sacred tree. Note that Abraham's wife Sarah stands right by the tree, as if she is part of it. She is also depicted in a blue head scarf similar to that seen in images of the Virgin Mary.

She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her – (Proverbs 3:15 – 18 ) The goddess specifically associated with the Tree of Life was known as Nuith or Nut. The English word ―nut‖ (signifying the fruit of a tree) comes from her name. Paintings on papyrus can still be seen featuring images of the goddess Nuith standing by or even in the sacred life giving tree. Many other pagan goddesses were associated with the tree of life. The mother of Adonis, for example, was known as Myrrha, a word that relates to the fragrant myrrh plant. (Myrrha was turned into a tree by the gods, a nd her son Adonis was born from her trunk.) The name Myrrha is turns up in the Bible as Mary the Virgin Mother and Mary Magdalene, the fallen women. The Egyptian version is Meri, meaning \"beloved.\" Many Egyptian goddesses had \"Meri\" as a pseudonym. The wor d merry , meaning \"joyous\" is also a derivation. The name Adonis means \"lord,\" or \"high one.\" In Babylon, Adonis was known as Tammuz, another god heavily connected to trees and vegetation. (The River Thames comes from this god's name, as does the Biblical T homas.) Women sit by the gate weeping for Tammuz, or they offer incense to Baal on roof - tops and plant pleasant plants. These are the very features of the Adonis cult: a cult confined to women which is celebrated on flat roof - tops on which sherds sown with quickly germinating green salading are placed, Adonis gardens... the climax is loud lamentation for the dead god - Walter Burkert ( Greek Religion ) Women in Athens would plant \"gardens of Adonis\" quick - growing herbs that sprang up from seed and died. The F estival of Adonis was celebrated by women at midsummer by sowing fennel and lettuce, and grains of wheat and barley. The plants sprang up soon, and withered quickly, and women mourned for the untimely death of the vegetation god - (Wikipedia Online Encyclo pedia, on Adonis) ...This Holy Spirit, the Great Mother, is symbolized by a great Tree whose branches spread over the entire world and reach above the heavens.

The proto - Christians were Atonists, or members of the Solar Cult. They were paternalistic and so was their god.

In early Judaism, for instance, women were revered, and there are hints throughout the scripture s indicating that women played a significant role in Christianity before the time of its codification at Nicea.

W e also have remonstrations against the veneration of nature and other gods and goddesses: And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done?

The Old Testament is the triumphal hymn of the victorious male religion, a song of victory commemorating the destruction of all traces of the matriarchy in religion and society – ( Love, Sexuality and Matriarchy ) Wha t the Christian mythmongers chose not to reveal is that the female was the forbidden fruit. In fact, in the earliest times, god was the tree. Before the Book of Genesis was written, god and the tree were one. In short, in the unadulterated version, woman i nitiates man into his godhead.

Some legends hold that the god of the tree (Jehovah or Elohim) created woman not as a companion for man but as consort for himself. He wished to mate with her, and from their union came man. Ergo, woman is not man‘s equal or wife but his superior .

Visible creation proceeds from her womb, and it is only then that the sexes become divided into two, only then does the masculine come into being.

It was a sacred tree among the Arabs, who made of it the idol Al - Uzza, which Mohammed destroyed. It is abundant as a bush in the desert of Thur; and of it the ̳crown of thorns‘ was composed, which was set on the forehead of Jesus of Nazareth.

In his treatise on ancient pagan beliefs, mythologist Sir James George Frazer explained that the concept of a crucified savior was not original to Christianity or Judaism. Nor was it only male heroes or saints that sacrific ed themselves so that others could survive. In pagan times, the rites of sacrificial death and rebirth included female goddesses and heroines: Orph eus, one of the main prototypes for the Biblical Jesus, with his \"crown of thorns.\" Like Apollo, Sir Tristan, Krishna, King David, and many other heroes and deities, Orpheus was a lover of music. Perhaps this connotes a Bardic (Druidic) connection. In Greece the great goddess Artemis herself appears to have been annually hanged in effigy in her sacred grove of Condylea among the Arcadian hills, and there accordingly she went by the name of the Hanged One...Every year thevirgins sacrificed a young goat t o the image by hanging it, because Aspalis was said to have hanged herself. The sacrifice may have been a substitute for hanging an image or a human representative of Artemis. Again, in Rhodes the fair Helen was worshipped under the title of Helen of the T ree...At Hierapolis also the victims were hung on trees before they were burnt. With these Greek and Scandinavian parallels before us we can hardly dismiss as wholly improbable the conjecture that in Phrygia a man - god may have hung year by year on the sacr ed but fatal tree - ( The Golden Bough, 1922) The male priests who were illegitimate preservers of the knowledge of the Druids and Arya, knew the facts we reveal here. They knew of the spiritual significance of the goddess and the female. They also know tha t women give birth. Because they conceive men inside their bodies, women are inarguably higher up the ontological ladder than man. Man does not possess such an an ability. In other words, woman creates as gods create. She is, therefore, closer to the gods and goddesses than man.

Subsequently, the theocrats have sought to marginalize and disempower women. ...to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we , and our fathers, our kings, and our princes – (Jeremiah 44:17) Ezekiel complained that Jewish women spent much of their time ―making hangings for the groves‖ (Ezek 16:16) – Ernest Busenbark ( Symbols, Sex and the Stars ) The earliest societies gave special importance to the mother and thus to woman in general. The Hebraic tradition, in which woman‘s status was diminished and god became a solitary male warrior or shepherd, and in the Islamic religion which it inspired, were both conceived by nomads used to t he dryness of the desert. And the female divinity undoubtedly sank to her lowest position during the period when Rome forced its empire to accept both its patriarchal regime and its amazingly sterile religious formalism, part of which survived in early Chr istianity – Jean Markale ( The Celts ) According to the Talmud a service can take place in the Synagogue only if ten persons are present, which number ensures the presence of God in the assembly. Drach explains however that these persons must all be men. ―If then there were nine men and a million women there could be no assembly, for the reason that women are nothing‖ – (From Secret Societies and Subversive Movements , by Nesta Webster) Let Mary leave us, for women are not worthy of life – St. Peter (Gospel of Thomas) Pagan temples were either closed, transformed into Christian shrines, or demolished.

Destruction is their god's middle name. In his masterly work entitled The Alphabet Versus the Goddess , author Leonard Shlain put the matter into these words: ...monotheism does not mirror human society. Humans are first and foremo st social animals. A deity who was alone, not by choice but because there were no other companions for Him, was a concept without parallel in human society. The god of the Israelites did not have a wife, a son, a daughter, or a mother Psychologist Esther H arding links the rise of pathological religion to the hegemony of the Solar Cults.

This change in secular power coincided with the rise of sun worship under a male priesthood...Sun worship was usually introduced and established by an edict of a military dictator, as happened in Babyl on and Egypt, and probably other countries as well Around 1500 BC there were hundreds of goddess - based sects enveloping the Mediterranean basin. By the fifth century AD they had almost been completely eradicated, by which time women were also prohibited fr om conducting a single major Western sacrament – Leonard Shlain ( The Alphabet Versus the Goddess ) Six thousand years ago patriarchy triumphed over women, and society became organized on the basis of male domination.

It shows the pre - Christian primal parents, the serpent, and central tree representing god. The tree is divided according to the 3 - 4 ratio and is conspicuou sly phallic.

One of the best examples of priestly plagiarization and adaption is found in the Gospel of Mark. It is the beautiful account of the anointing of Jesus with priceless spikenard.

In his mind, at least, it was intended to be a ritual...the ceremony is hardly typical of Judaic practice - Picket and Prince ( Templar Revelation ) Spikenard is a poten t plant from which an extremely aromatic resin is extracted. In ancient times it was very rare and expensive and was used ritually. It was frequently employed by women during pregnancy, but had many other properties. The term \"nard\" (spikenard's original n ame) comes from an ancient city of that name in Syria and is a variation of narthex , the name for a church lobby where holy water and other sacred objects are often kept.

After all, Jesus is depicted as distinctly androgynous by most Christian artists. This makes him the equivalent of many gods of antiquity, such as the Babylonian Bel and Canaanite Baal: Baal was one of two separate deities, at times represented the dual gender of a single androgynous deity. As twins, Baal and Astarte were two aspects of one god, who personified the reproductive energies of nature. Baal, came to represent the sky god, the god of thunder, who fertilizes the goddess, mother earth, to bring forth life...Baal and Astarte generally being represented by a pillar, known as the Asher ah in the Bible, a Hebrew word, also common noun, meaning a sacred tree or pole used in the goddess cult - David Livingstone ( The Dying God ) An image below shows blood on the neck of an androgynous Jesus.

The Catholics may plead that the books were generally committed to the flames; that the treatises of famous sorcerers and enchanters perished with their accursed authors. But the Vatican, if it could speak, could tell a different story. It knows too well of the existence of certain closets and rooms, access to which is had but by the very few. It knows that the entrances to these secret hiding - places are so cleverly concealed from sight in the carved frame - work and under the profuse ornamentation of the library - walls, that there have even been Popes who lived and died within the precincts of the palace without ever suspecting their existence.

It has also been symbolized by a single open eye. The attainment of spiritual and rogyny was once the sole goal of alchemy, magic, yoga, and religion. As we mentioned above, the very names Jehovah and Elohim connote androgyny and contain feminine suffixes. However, when it comes to gods and religion, androgyny is a very old story: I am Atum, the creator of the Eldest Gods, I am he who gave birth to Shu, I am that great he - she.

The initial letters of which are I, N, R, I. (In Latin the initial letters of the names of the elements are also I, N, R, I.)

We find relics of th eir presence in the Middle and Far East, in Egypt, India, and China. The hallmark of their theology was reverence for nature. To the Arya and Druids, the earth was alive, intelligent, and sacred. One meaning of the word Druid is \"Keeper or Servant of Truth .\" Another is \"Door of Gate Keeper.\" The Gaelic word Doire , refers to the Druids and is the origin of the modern word \"door.\" Of course, we recall the many Megalithic sites and stone monuments, erected at the behest of the Druidic Order, that often resembl e portals or doorways. In Appendix One we showed how Druidic imagery turns up in artwork composed by ostensibly Christian artists. Like in the painting below, by Andres Mantegna, entitled The Adoration of the Shepherds, we see the triform tree, standing st one, sacred mound, tree of life, and portal. These are all leitmotifs associated with Ireland, and with the Celts, Gaels, and Druids. Ma ntegna shows Joseph sleeping. Above him is the tree. The image of the sleeping prophet reoccurs in the Old Testament prophesy about the coming of Jesus. The passage comes from the Book of Isaiah and is remarkably Druidic in its imagery: There shall come fo rth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his root - (Isaiah 11:1)"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"In the Latin Vulgate, the Druidic imagery is more pronounced. Instead of \"shoot\" the Vulgate has \"green twig.\" In Latin this is virga , a pun on the word \"virgin.\" Again, we see that the mythmongers were completely aware of the relationship between the female goddess and the sacred tree. Moreover, Jesse is a rendition of Esse or Esus, the Irish - Druidic god of vegetation. (See Appendix One for more on Esus.) When arti sts depict the passage from the Book of Isaiah, they invariably include a magnificent tree or vine growing near, or even out of, the body of the sleeping Jesse. Images of the so - called \"Tree of Jesse,\" from chapter eleven of the Book of Isaiah. The passage purportedly predicts the coming of Jesus Christ. The imagery here, as in other areas of the Bible, is purely Druidic and Aryan. The Druids referred to themselves as the Naddreds or Adders. These terms, like the Hindu Naga , mean \"Serpents.\" The Druids were, therefore, a Serpent P riesthood. This does not mean anything sinister. It merely means that they were astrologers and members of the Stellar Cult. It also means that they were geomancers, familiar with the subtle energy pathways of the Earth. We saw above how the Caduceus of He rmes represented the healing arts. The term for serpent in Hebrew, nahash , also means \"those who know.\" This symbol of the staff and serpent was erected in the Wilderness by Moses, after the exodus. This act not only confirms that Moses was of Pharaonic bl oodline, but that he was familiar with Druidic ways. In other words, he and his Israelites, were Arya. The staff and snake appeared earlier in the Old Testament. We saw Aaron and Moses turn their royal staffs into serpents when they came in front of the Ph araoh to negotiate the release of their people: And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. And Moses and Aaron went"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the Lord had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent – (Exodus 7:5 - 7) The so - called ‖Brazen Serpent‖ was the stan dard of a sect known as Naassians. In ancient Hebrew, Nasi referred to a spiritual or religious leader. Moses was an Atonist who understood that the sun had passed from the house of Taurus into that of Aries. He wanted his people to honor that sidereal cha nge. The stories of the erecting of the standard in the \"Wilderness\" and the conflict on Mount Sinai cryptically conceal astrological phenomena. (See Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs , by Ralph Ellis for more on this subject.) Of course, it is interesting to fin d out how important the serpent symbol was to the Western Arya and Druids. This is particularly so, given that there are no snakes in Ireland. It is also significant because we see that the Egyptian priest - kings also showed inordinate reverence for the sym bol. The Pharaohs donned the Uraeus serpent coronet as a sign of mastery and enlightenment. (The word Pharaoh comes from \"pharos nous,\" meaning \"enlightened or fiery mind.\") It was, however, not physical snakes or reptiles that interested the adepts and ca used them to adopt serpentine iconography. It was the stellar antetype that fascinated these astrologically - minded men. It was the giant constellation of Draco that caught their eyes and imagination. It was the protector of the heavens, of Eden, of paradis e. It coiled around the pole and kept watch over the sacred apples or stars. It was the circumpolar dragon, the guardian of the imperishable Khus, or everlasting souls that traversed the many demanding trials of the afterlife to enter Amenta in a morally u ncorrupted state. ...the Uraeus...is frequently represented as guarding the sacred cypress groves of the Amenti (Sheol) by breathing out fire to destroy any invading or unjustified soul. Hence the origin of the Grecian myth of the Hesperides garden and th e fire - breathing dragons which guarded it - William Ricketts Cooper ( The Serpent Myths of Ancient Egypt ) The great constellation of Draco was seen and revered by most of the civilized cultures and tribes of the Northern hemisphere. The Nordics shaped their great boats in the form of Draco the cosmic dragon. The Native American Indians named their tribes after it, and performed many dances to represent celestial movements. The Irish Druids made good use of the symbol on their monuments. A symbol of sacred k nowledge in antiquity was a tree, ever guarded by a serpent, the serpent or dragon of wisdom. The serpent of Hercules was said to guard the golden apples that hung from the pole, the Tree of Life, in the midst of the garden of Hesperides. The serpent that guarded the golden fruit...and the serpent of the Garden of Eden...are the same – E. Valentia Straiton ( The Celestial Ship of the North ) ...the nuptial tree, round which coils the serpent, is connected with time and with life as a necessary condition; and with knowledge – the knowledge of a scientific priesthood, inheriting records and traditions hoary, perhaps, with the snows of a glacial epoch – Kennersley Lewis The term Messiah is not a Jewish term. It is an Egyptian pseudonym for the initiated man. Spec ifically, it signified an adept and astrologer. This is why the serpent becomes the symbol of the adept. It represents Draco in the sky.

Such functionaries thus became `holy,' that is separated to the god's service, being smeared, or `anointed' with his divine substance. They were therefore called `the anointed ones,' that is, `messiahs,' or christs, more specifically in the Old Testament, `those anointed with Jehovah/Yahweh' - John Marco Allegro ( The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth ) Another name for the polar region was \"Meskhen,\" meaning \"womb\" or \"birthplace.\" This celestial garden turns up in the Bible as the G arden of Eden. It is the origin of paradise (from para dios or ―park of the gods‖), and of Zion, which, like the English word zone, signifies a sacred enclosure. It is the antetype upon which Caer Sidi, Arcadia, Aaru, Avalon, Asgard, Emrys, Camelot, Swarga , Elysium, and the Garden of Hesperides were based.

As we can see from this image, the fleur - de - lis is hardly connected to the Christian Virgin Mary, as most historians erroneously allege.)

In Palestine, the Bible tells us, they venerated...the simulacra of Ashtaroth, representing this goddess of the fruitful and nourishing earth under the form of a tree - Goblet d'Alviella ( The Migration of Symbols, 1894) Once these facts are fully understood, we have a deeper understanding of the mechanism of deception set into motion by Christian mythmongers. The very idioms and traditions, customs and rites, chu rchmen instruct their flock to deride and suspiciously avoid, remain in use, but in a manner not observed by the masses under priestly control. Most importantly, the ancient insignias of truth, wisdom, and sanctity have been corrupted and mutilated by the worst breed of deceivers this world has ever had to endure.

The biblical rendering of this representation is a blasphemy against the Ritual, against womankind, against nature, and against knowledge. The goddess Nut, who offers the fruit of the tree of knowledge to the kneeling man, is in shape a woman, and the meaning could be only too easily misread, as it has been in the legend of the first woman who tempted the first man to eat of the forbidden fruit and to cause the loss of paradise – Gerald Massey We are told that the prohibiti on to eat the fruit was issued to Adam before Eve was released from her imprisonment in Adam‘s rib...before she became a woman and a wife; and it is not even implied that it was intended to extend to her. Why, then, in the name of God, should such curses b e heaped upon her devoted head for eating the fruit when she had not been forbidden to do so? – Joseph Wheless ( Bible of Bibles ) And so, we now know what the so - called \"tree of the knowledge of good and evil\" was. Given the preposterousness of the Genesis account, we can conclude that the forbidden fruit was certainly not fruit, and that the tree was not a tree. The tree was the celestial tree, the polar axis, or ―World Tree‖ of the universal garden that stretched between heaven and hell. Its fruits (golden apples) were the stars of the circumpolar region. The guarding serpent was Draco. It was the mystery school of the heavens that was not meant to be approached. It was the telestrion of the stars that was off limits.

They have converted popular and happy nations into deserts, and have made our beautiful world into a slaughter house drenched with blood and tears - W. Winwood Reade With this in mind we pose some important questions. We ask, who rules our world today? Who subtly controls the hearts and minds of millions of men and women, and enjoyed centuries of earthly dominion? Who has robbed man of his sanity and reason and seduced him into murdering his own soul? Who has succeeded in turning man into a guilt - ridden, self - hating, world - denying, god and devil - fearing slave? Who has denigrated women and animals, darkness, silence, and inwardness? Who has f illed the world with blustering extroverts, fanatics, ignoramuses, mass murderers, tyrants, and psychopaths? Who has rewarded the bringers of death and disorder and condemned every sane healer, inventor, and peace - maker? The Christian Church has left a leg acy, a world view, that permeates every aspect of Western society, both secular and religious. It is a legacy that fosters sexism, racism, the intolerance of difference, and the desecration of the natural environment...Christianity has helped to create a soc iety in which people are alienated not only from each other but also from the divine – Helen Ellerbe ( The Dark Side of Christian History ) The story of the Roman Church is quite different and not a pleasant one to dwell upon.

Well, in previous sections we saw that the sacerdotal fe male of ancient civilizations and goddess figure of mythology were intimately connected with certain sacred trees and plants. We saw that the sophic female is the veritable burnished or bright one, the burning tree through which the voice of \"god\" (or more correctly goddess ) speaks. We learned that in many cases the tree of life works as a symbol for the poles of the earth and celestial sphere. In short, it can be said that the sacerdotal female, tree of life (or tree of the knowledge of good and evil), and symbol of the serpent, are to all intents and purposes indistinguishable. Sidereally and mythologically, they represent the same phenomena. We have provided examples to demonstrate how the sidereal motifs of ancient cults were appropriated and adapted to suit the needs of a misogynist and profoundly phallocentric priesthood that has ruled the world for centuries. It goes without saying that the feminine garb worn by Christian priests and clergy, as well as the innumerable goddess symbols employed by the Ch urch, were not incorporated to express adoration or venerate the female spirit and feminine mode of expression. On the contrary, their incorporation represents a wholesale desecration of the female sex and feminine principle. The male priest adorns himself in the garb of the priestess to symbolize conquest over her and her kind, not to represent spiritual androgyny. The priest has pillaged her holy garb and, symbolically speaking, has raped her body in order to assume the power he covets but despises."},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":" Kneeling before the sacred vagina We have come to accept the catalog of wreck and ruin perpetrated by early Christians on the pagan world's shrines, temples, statuary, and libraries.

Winwood Reade said: \"The simplicity of men, and the cunning of their pr iests has destroyed or corrupted all the religions of the world.\" Baron Avro Manhattan also addressed the matter of priestly intrigue and wrote: Pagan temples were either closed, transformed into Christian shrines or demolished. Their properties were summa rily added to the Church‘s patrimony.

As the writings of Julius Caesar reveal, the Druids of Britain and Western Europe were men of the highest spiritual level: As one of their leading dogmas, they include this: that souls are not annihilated, but pass after death from one b ody to another, and they hold that by this teaching, men are much encouraged to valor, through disregarding the fear of death.

One of their temples in the island of Lewis in the Hebrides, bears evident signs of their ski ll in the science. Every stone in the temple is placed astronomically. The circle consists of twelve equidistant obelisks denoting the twelve signs of the zodiac.

It was particularly conspicuous during the eighteenth dynasty, during the advent of Akhenaton's brand of monotheism. However, there are patristic expressions in religion before Akhenaton's time. When we see ima ges of Akhenaton and his father Tuthmosis III with distended stomachs to impersonate pregnancy, we are not seeing an homage of female sexuality. On the contrary, we are seeing a rejection of it. The hermaphrodite negates the separate presence and role of t he female. She has been figuratively and mythologically displaced as wife, mother, priestess, and queen. Akhenaton and Tuthmosis assume for themselves the sexual traits that position the female close to the level of the gods. They assume a form that dispos sesses the female and symbolizes their ability to reproduce without her. Symbolically, the Pharaoh becomes a god and a goddess. Ultimately, to the average monotheist there is only the male god.

The male priests who were illegitimate preservers of the knowledge of the Druids and Arya, knew about the spiritual significance of the goddesses they emasculated and dethroned. They knew wo men give birth to men and that it is not the other way around. Therefore, sexually speaking, women are inarguably higher up the ontological ladder than men. In other words, woman creates as the gods create. Woman is, therefore, closer to the divine than ma n is. Over the centuries, men have become infected by subconscious envy towards women, and the priests are for the most part the worst afflicted specimens.

She was the result of one of Zeus' great feats of male pregnancy and parturition, the other being Dionysus. Ath ena was born, highly symbolically, from her father's head - that is, out of patriarchal male fantasy. In the most common version of her birth, when Zeus' cerebral pregnancy had come to term, the divine craftsman Hephaestus split Zeus' head open with an ax and out sprang Athena, fully equipped with the armor of militarism Speaking specifically about male envy, Keuls writes: The governing principle of a phallocracy is that the human race is essentially male, the female being a mere adjunct, unfortunately requ ired for the purpose of reproduction The Greek mythological obsession with monstrous women and with gynecocracy (literally \"women's rule,\" but more accurately \"women getting out of hand\") reflects man's irrational fear of the female and his feelings of gui lt...The Jungian psychologist Erich Neumann wrote the most influential book on the worship of the female in the man's prehistoric past, The Great Mother...Neumann sees phallic worship as a reaction in man's development, an attempt to free himself from bond age to the female development, and attempt to free himself from bondage to the female principle and canonize the penis as the fundamental generator of life According to Keuls, the writings of many Athenian philosophers and playwrights are saturated with an imosity toward females.

In the Book of Genesis that was, along with res t of the Judaic Pentateuch, subsequently added to the New Testament, we see Adam's first wife, Lilith, portrayed as a demoness, and we find his second wife, Eve, cast as a disobedient temptress. In the Church's perverse works, male Adam gives birth to fema le Eve, as Jehovah had given it to him. In a supreme act of illogical inversion, woman is born of man . However, although the customs, rites, and traditions of the goddess were officially and publicly suppressed, the Church deliberately incorporated key ele ments of the goddess tradition into their own iconography and dogma. Of course, the process of misrepresentation and cannibalization started long before the Christian era. We need only look to the Old Testament to find evidence of it. In the following pass ages from the Book of Isaiah and Book of Exodus, we have clear examples of theocratic colonization: The sun will not more be your light by day, nor with the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the Lord will be your everlasting Light, and your God will be your glory. Your Sun will never set again, and your moon will set no more; the Lord will be your everlasting Light, and your days of sorrow will end - (Isaiah 60:18 - 20) And God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God, which have brought th ee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

Conclusion ...The wave of religious terrorism that swept Egypt for twenty years seemed to some Egyptians to herald the end of the world. \"If we are alive,\" one wrote, \"then life itself is dead\" - R. A. Gabriel ( Jesus the Egyptian ) For t wo millennia Western man has quiescently and faithfully listened to the chants and hymns, chorals and \"Alleluias,\" and in a perfectly sedated and delusional state has committed atrocities in the name of a religion that arose like a specter from the frenzie d flames of war and murder. Bishops have blessed armies as they've trudged off to genocidal conquests and priests have blessed wars that have lasted as long as one hundred years. With their words and deeds, priesthoods of the Western world have confounded man's psyche and turned him into a obsessed, blood crazed savage. Their holy books have denigrated womankind and mutilated the rites and iconography pertaining to sophic mysteries. Their ideology has turned man from the zodiac, the telestrion of night, tha t was his first church and college. From that heavenly altar, man's attention was trained on depraved images of the cruciform tree and nails of pain, the whips and chains and broken tablets, the serpentine devil, guilt and sin. If he sailed to the west he' d fall off the edge of the world. If he questioned the scriptures, his soul would be damned. In 356 C.E. Constantinus II ordered the Egyptian temples of Isis - Osiris closed and forbade the use of Egyptian hieroglyphics as a religious language. In 380 C.E. E mperor Theodosius declared Christianity to be the official Roman state religion, and all pagan cults were thereafter forbidden. These edicts were devastating to Egyptian culture and religion, both of which had been preserved over millennia through the Egyp tian language and the writing systems of Egyptian priests. In 391 C.E. the Patriarch of Alexandria, Theophilus, summoned the monks to arms and turned them against the city of Memphis and the great shrine of Serapis, the Serapeum, the main temple of the Osi rian - Isis religion. The attack was akin to ordering the destruction of the Vatican. Egyptian priests were massacred in their shrines and in the streets. The ferocity of the violence consumed priests, followers, and the Egyptian intellectual elite of Alexan dria, Memphis, and other cities of Egypt who were murdered and their temples and libraries destroyed. The institutional structure of Egyptian religion, then more than four millennia old, was demolished in less than two decades - R. A. Gabriel ( Jesus the Eg yptian ) Every science was regarded as an outcast, an enemy. Every fact held the creed of the church in scorn. Investigators were enemies in disguise. Thinkers were traitors, and the church exerted its vast power for centuries to prevent the intellectual pr ogress of man. There was no liberty, no education, no philosophy, no science; nothing but credulity,"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"ignorance, and superstition. The world was really under the control of Satan and his agents. The church, for the purpose of increasing her power, exhausted every means to convince the people of the existence of witches, devils, and fiends. In this way the church had every enemy within her power. She simply had to charge him with being a wizard, of holding communication with devils, and the ignorant mob were ready to tear him to pieces - Robert Green Ingersoll ( The Great Infidels, 1881) ...the great library at Alexandria, on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, the repository of some of the ancient world‘s oldest records, was put to the torch not just once but thre e times – by Julius Caesar, by a Christian mob, and by an Islamic caliph. Most of the records are deemed to have been destroyed, although it seems that a few later found their way to Byzantium, and others may well have been stored safely elsewhere...the empe ror Diocletian then had yet further esoteric works (again of the Egyptians) burned in AD 296, at both Alexandria and Byzantium – John Gordon ( Egypt: Child of Atlantis ) ... Christian Literalism, now the only legal religion in the Roman Empire, launched a bru tal crusade to completely eradicate its old rivals, Christian Gnosticism and ancient Paganism. In an orgy of violence, armies of fanatical Christian Literalists tore down the architectural wonders of the Pagan world. They built infernal bonfires of books c ontaining the spiritual wisdom and scientific knowledge of the ages. They subjected to grisly torture and a painful death philosophers, priestesses, and scientists - anyone who disagreed. They did not stop until they had cut the head off Western culture, l eaving it to wander like an amnesiac in an ignorant stupor. They did not stop until they had cut the heart out of Western spirituality, bleeding it dry of its mystical vitality. The corpse of a religion which remained offered nothing but hope of a better a fterlife in return for blind belief in its irrational opinions and unquestioning allegiance to power - crazed popes. This tyrannical empire of the soul extended the arm of the state right into the inner sanctum of every individual, denying the right to spiri tual autonomy and compelling all to acquiesce or burn - Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy ( Jesus and the Lost Goddess ) Due to the influx of spiritual poison, man's reason has atrophied to such an extent that he now finds it difficult to correctly discern right from wrong, good from bad, and truth from falsehood. A study of the human moral predicament tells us that man is not progressing but regressing . He is not modern, but primitive . He is not a lover of order but of chaos. He does not seek freedom, he's scare d to death of it. And his \"love,\" for want of a word, is narcissistic and necrotic. It is the \"dark secret love\" of the poets, and it has turned him from a intimate relationship with the sky and stars, mountains and trees, animals, birds, and winds. Spirit ual ignorance is the mother of all evil. Ignorance will eventuate in death, because those who come from ignorance neither were, nor are, nor shall be - (Gospel of Philip) Modern man does not stand upright in kingly fashion in the world made for him by his priests. On the contrary, he hangs upside - down in the world and does not see the real. He sees the image and the chimera. He is not sober, he is drunk. He is not well, he is poisoned and infected by the same psychic pathogens that have corrupted his mislea ders. He acts and speaks as they act and speak, and covets whatever they enjoy and covet. He and they are not sane, they are unsane , not rising but falling. Inwardly, man is not satiated, he is starving. Spiritually naked, he craves to make his empty exist ence better, brighter, faster, freer, healthier, and cleaner. And at that, at least, he has succeeded. His starless, treeless, loveless world sparkles with its own morbid beauty. It is exquisite in its intricacy and sterile efficiency; precious in its obsc ene complexity."},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"...the priestly account of Creation is but kindergarten cosmology, yet we have accepted it for two thousand years. This is because Western man is incapable of abstract thought...In his metaphysical incompetency Western man has put the stamp of his own ego on everything, including the Creator - Lloyd Graham ( Myths and Deceptions of the Bible ) Man is haunted by the fact that he cannot emulate or rival the power nature has over his body and mind. He covets that power and wants it for himself, b ut it won't come into his hands. Therefore, he has become obsessed with technological advancement, thinking it will bring him nearer to the stars and the elusive sanctum he believes lies at the end of his fitful search. He is wrong, because nothing he cont rives to do in the name of vanity will bring him nearer to the stars and luminaries. It will only drive him closer to the vile perfidious god enthroned at the center of his psychosis. It will only lead him and his world to the unhallowed portals of oblivio n. Loud is the claim of the nineteenth century to preeminence in civilization over the ancients, and still more clamorous that of the churches and their sycophants that Christianity has redeemed the world from barbarism and idolatry. How little both are warranted...The light of Christianity has only served to show how much more hypocrisy and vice its teachings have begotten in the world since its advent, and how immensely superior were the ancients over us in every point of honor – Madame Helena Petrovna Bl avatsky Man can't own the stars in heaven, so he makes them here on earth from plastic and stone. He feverishly decimates forests while he blithely marvels at the columns that hold up the Parthenon and Lincoln Memorial. The civilization in ruins around him was created by men who did not think of a leaf as something that merely hung from a branch. They did not think of stars as something outside and far away. They did not consider nature to be their private backyard or as something to be controlled, owned, p robed, and pillaged. Their religion did not tell them that man came into the world from elsewhere. It told them that man was a part of nature, not apart from it. It told them that man's existence was similar in kind to that of trees, clouds, and river wate r, and that if a man peered deeply into nature, into the world around him, he would find his own reflection gazing back at him. ...All the glories of Nature - the imposing silence of the night; the aroma of the flowers; the pale rays of the moon through t he green tufts of the trees; the stars, flowers of fire strewn over the sky; the glow - worms, flowers of fire strewn over the grass - all these have been created to render the Adept worthy of NATURE, at that moment when for the first time she exclaims to Ma n, \"I am yours,\" - words formed of a divine perfume from the soul, which, breathed forth, ascends to heaven together with the perfume of the flowers - the one moment of his life when he is king, when he is God; the moment which he expiates and pays for wit h a whole life of bitter regrets. That moment - it is the price of all our miseries - Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky Man is the world and the world is man. Nature is the self and the self is nature. A natural religion is a human religion. Consciousness, of one sort or another, is shared by everything living here and now in the creation, from the neutron star to the subatomic particle. Nothing is dead. Nothing is inanimate. A thing lives , and has an everlasting relationship with everything else. Man is no t alone in the creation and does not require remote invisible voices behind the clouds or in the dark places beneath the earth to instruct or waylay him. Man is his own student and teacher and his prestigious school is nature, the House of Life. Nothing is missing in the life of a man who has nature as his mentor."},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"The Druids and Shaman knew they were born from the womb of nature, not from somewhere beyond or outside it. They knew their lifeforce came from nature and that death simply meant a return to the sacred bosom of the universal mother.

They, like Moses, realized that the day will come when the earthy sandals will be removed in the presence of the inexting uishable burning tree. Moses heard Jehovah describe himself as the god of his \"fathers.\" Yes, but what about the mother? What about the goddess? Why is she nowhere to be found in Judaism and Christianity? Are men born only from men? Are men afraid of the p ower that can never be theirs? And has that fear turned the world into a hellish vale of iron and tears?

Those who steer humanity toward such stultification are madmen or criminals - R. A. Schwall er de Lubicz ( Egyptian Miracle ) Man did not lose his connection with the divine. It was taken from him - stolen in the night by clever, ruthless, and demented men who desired power over man and nature. Both have been victimized, humiliated, and cheated. Ne vertheless, nature is going nowhere, because although nature can be abused and altered, it cannot be destroyed. It is humankind that is endangered and in need of constant warning. Human beings are the ones who need to be strictly reminded of the need for m oral and spiritual immunity and psychic sovereignty. Man needs to remember that he and nature are one and that a crime against nature is a crime against his own being, his own soul.

Their writings speak of the fair - complexioned men of the W est visiting and migrating to their lands. As we showed in Volume One, place names such as Erech and Eridu contain syllables referring to the primordial goddess of Ireland. Goddesses permeated Ireland. Mountain, rivers, valleys, wells, all testified to her presence. Around the eleventh century, Ireland became known predominately as Eire, a name derived from the Goddess Eriu, one of the triple Goddesses: Eriu, Banba, and Fotla...Eriu makes it clear that anyone wishing to enter Ireland would have to revere the goddesses if they wished to prosper and be fruitful – Mary Condren ( The Serpent and the Goddess ) Not much more than one per cent of Irela nd's surface now contains broad - leaved trees - Bob Quinn ( The Atlantean Irish ) Above we see the so - called \"Libation Cup\" of Sumerian King Gudea.

And as Gua rdian of the Tree set in Heaven it was the Good Serpent, or intelligent Dragon, as keeper of the treasures of Astral knowledge. It was the later Theology, Persian and Hebrew, that gave the character of the Evil One to the Serpent of Wisdom, and perverted t he original meaning, both of the temptation and the Tempter who protected the Tree; which has been supplemented by the theology of the Vitriol - throwers who have scarified and blasted the face of nature on earth, and defiled and degraded the starry Intellig encers in heaven – Gerald Massey ( The Hebrew and Other Creations Fundamentally Explained )"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"One of the oldest cities in Southern Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq) was Lagash. This name also contains the syllable of the ash tree. Lagash (from Lagas ) was construct ed over three thousand years BC and it served as a capital of the Sumerian (Sum Arya), Akkadian, and Guti (or Gutean) empires. Lagash and the surrounding lands were frequented (from 2150 BC) by a race known to historians as the Guti. The name Gudea not on ly derives from the root gut, meaning ―goat,‖ but it is decidedly and suggestively similar to the word Judea . This is not so remarkable when the true meaning of the terms Judea and Jew is contemplated. They did not refer to race but were titles. They refer red to the yew tree or, more specifically, to ―Men of the Yew,‖ that is to the W estern Arya. A secondary connotation of Judah and Jew was ―Judge.‖ King Gudea of Sumeria. Sumeria is similar to a Gaelic word meaning \"serpent.\" The names and words Judah, Jude, George , Tudor , Tutor , and Judge derive from the same root as Gudea. Gudea can certainly be considered the great judge of his people. Additionall y, the syllable dea , in his name, might refer to ―holy‖ or even to ―god.‖ The name Gudea, then, could have meant ―Holy Goth‖ or ―God of the Goths‖ or ―Goat Men.‖ Akkadian King Sargon (or Saru Kin) the Great (2270 BC – 2215 BC) overthrew the Sumerian empire and controlled Mesopotamia for approximately 150 years.

The name of the ash tree can be discerned in the place name Assyria (Ash Arya).

Again, we emphasize that the trunks of trees were regarded by patristic cultures as phallic symbols, and worthy emblems of kingship and godhead. This is the reason wh y important modern state and educational buildings are frequently decorated with pillars and columns. The ash tree was particularly venerated by the ancients of Nordic countries. Yggdrasil, or ―Odin‘s Tree,‖ was conceived of as an great everlasting ash. On e of Ireland's earliest gods was known as Aesar or Iesa. The gods of Nordic lands were known as the Aesir, a word very close to Asir (or Wesir), the Egyptian rendering of Osiris, a god very much connected to the trees of life and death. The gods Anshur, At tis, Tammuz, and Adonis, are all connected to trees. The chief and most holy seat of the gods,\" say the Eddas, \"is by the ash Yggdrasil.

Three roots sustain the tree and stand wide apart - J. H. Philpot ( Trees in Religion and Myth , 1897) The haven of the Nordics was Asgard, meaning \"garden\" or \"grove of the gods:\" Asgard, the mountain of the gods, was pierced by a mighty tree trunk, the branches of which overshadowed the world and supported the sky, the stars, and the clouds, whilst its roots stretched downwards into the primordial abyss. The apples stored in Valhal, by eating which the gods preserved their youth , closely correspond to the amrita or soma which, as we shall see, was a peculiar feature of the Eastern conception of the world - tree - J. H. Philpot ( Trees in Religion and Myth , 1897) In Norse myths, the tree Yggdrasil is intimately connected to the prima l parents and sacerdotal female: There stands a beautiful hall near the fountain beneath the ash. Out of it come three maids. These maids shape the lives of men and we call them the Norns. On the boughs of the ash sits an eagle, who knows many things - (Th e Prose or Younger Edda. Translated by G. W. Dasent) ...we read in the Eddas that when heaven and earth had been made, Odin and his brothers walking by the sea - shore came upon two trees. These they changed into human beings, male and female. The first bro ther gave them soul and life ; the second endowed them with wit and will to move ; the third added face, speech, sight, and hearing.

The Rape of Tara, Hill of Kings During his interview with BBC Radio Ulster for the documentary ―Tar on Tara‖ Seamus Heaney, Irish bard and Nobel Laureate says: ―Tara means something equivalent to me to what Delphi means to the Greeks or maybe Stonehe nge to an English person, or N a ra in Japan, which is one of the most famous sites in the world. It's a word that conjures an aura - it conjures up what they call in Irish dúchas, a sense of belonging, a sense of patrimony, a sense of an ideal, an ideal of the spirit if you like, that belongs in the place and if anywhere in Ireland conjures that up - it's Tara - it's a mythical site of course. I mean the traces of Tara are in the grass, are in the earth....they are about origin, they're about beginning, they'r e about the mythological, spiritual source - a source and a guarantee of something old in the country and something that gives the country its distinctive spirit\" ...Byron Ballard, Village Witch of Asheville, NC and member of the Irish dia s pora agrees with Heaney‘s assessment of the spiritual importance of Tara. ―The loss of sacred landscape is as devastating to a culture as the loss of language. There is an ineffable quality that encompasses our mythic origins, our history and our ancestors and is a vital part of cultural identity. As we race headlong into the abyss of globaliz a tion, we are willfully destroying those markers that identify who we are as a people and as a cultural entity. That Ireland -- who faced (and still faces) the loss of her living lang u a ge and the induced diaspora of her people -- could willingly endorse this short - sighted and suicidal rape of her innermost self in the name of progress is breathtaking. The spiritual implications speak volumes about the loss of Ireland's great soul‖ - Caroli ne Kenner (The Ongoing Saga of Royal Tara and the Toll Road) The Hill of Tara Dated to approximately 2,000 years BC, it was the capital of the Celtic kings of Ireland, but was probably a site of importance in pre - Celtic times. It was named after the Arya and their Earth Goddess Eri or Ari. In Hebrew and Egyptian the word Tara means gateway or portal. It was also known as Drumcain (or \"Hill of the Serpents\"). The Tara Skryne Complex In May 2007 as part of the excavations for the M3 motorway the archaeo l o gists on the site of Lismullen in the Tara Skryne Complex found an ancient Henge; a ritual ceremonial site dating back to prehistoric times. Immediately this site was declared a National Monument and despite the ou t cry generated by it, the then minister for the environment, Dick Roche,"},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"ordered its removal from the Valley in order to continue with the construction of the controversial 7 km of the M3 across the Valley. The orientation of this Henge seems to be pointing to Newgrange, which may support the hy pothesis that the whole Tara Skryne Valley was a large co m plex, whose sites cannot be interpreted in isolation. If protected as it should be, the whole Valley could be designated a W orld Heritage Park, a place for the benefit and education of humanity and the expansion of Ancient Irish Civ i lization. To endanger such a place is a symptom of the greed, corruption and disre s pect being shown for nature, people and our environment. The solution to this controversy is to re - route 7 km of the double - tolled Moto r wa y, but it seems that vested interests in this area have been preventing the consideration of any alternatives. Ancient Burial Ground Destroyed An ancient burial ground near the Hill of Tara (Ireland) - said to be more i m pressive than the national monument discovered in recent months - has been destroyed. Bulldozers razed the Baronstown site to allow construction work on the controversial M3 motorway in Co Meath continue. Protesters claimed that the site, a Bronze Age settlement described as a 'multi - period archaeological complex' by archaeologist Joe Fenwick, was destroyed overnight after mach i nery moved in. They claim earth movers stripped the site at about 4am on W ednesday 4th July. W hen protesters arrived at 6am the entire site had been completely razed t o the ground. The complex dates back 4,000 years and the Campaign to Save Tara group claimed it had been recommended for national monument status by archae o logists working on the M3 project. But former environment minister Dick Roche rejected the applicati on. \"That they are destroying our heritage under cover of darkness says it all,\" campaigner Dr Muireann Ni Bhrolchain said, and repe a ted a call for construction work to be stopped at Tara until an archaeological committee set up by Environment Minister Joh n Gormley completed its work. The committee is chaired by Conor Newman, an archaeology professor at NUI Galway, and is charged with excavating the newly found National Monument at Lismullen, a few miles from the Baronstown site, prior to it being removed t o allow the road to go ahead. Protesters want the minister to declare the entire Tara Skryne Valley an a r chaeological conservation area, and re - route the motorway. Michael Canny said the work on the Baronstown site was a disgrace. \"If he had taken our"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"a d v ice perhaps another piece of our irreplaceable national heritage would not have been bulldozed.\" Protesters also claimed daily stand - offs with constru c tion workers at several sites along the route were becoming increasingly te n se. In recent weeks, one prot ester was arrested, but later released. Opus Dei & the Tara Valley Tragedy An investigation into the potential connections, motives and interests at play in the development of the M3 motorway: From multinational corporations and financiers to political amb itions and appointments to over - seeing authorities, to local interests and commercial opportunities. There has been a lot made of the supposed role and intent Opus Dei may have had in facilitating the M3 project. I think their role is very obvious, in the significance of their location of their retreat and head - quarters, and by their sile n ce in having a major road built in their back garden and the benefits it will give them, in addition to the churches silence on the project in general. As to OD‘s influenc e of the financial and construction contracts, that is spec u lation. However, seen in the international context, parallels and connections can be inferred. On a more local level, OD‘s role in the instigation, planning and approval of the project, can only b e found in conjecture, and should not be overestimated when compared to the other formal and informal, secret or overt networks that exist in Ireland, from the golf course to the GAA, the Knights of St Columbanus to chambers of commerce. Here the forces of vested interest in political, ego and financial fulfillment can be found. What follows is internet based research that investigates possible motives and connections between parties involved in the M3 project. The research was conducted from the prospecti ve of finding Opus Dei connections. It concludes in noting the influence and interest of Noel Dempsey, minister and local TD. Opus Dei was formed in Spain before the war, they now has about 87,000 members in more than 80 different countries, about 60% in Europe, mostly Spain, where it is estimated that 20% of the Spanish parliament is made up of OD members. A further 35% of OD membership is found in the Americas. Their agenda was always right wing, capitalist and corporate. Membership of OD is by invitatio n and usually kept a secret; however members of OD will h a ve a similar profile. Conservative, elitist, devout, pro - life, homophobic, nation a list, right - wing, corporate, professional, influential but very private, avoidance of publicity, rather be judged th rough deeds, masochistic, strong work ethic, evangelical, philanthropic, drawn to celibacy or married would have very large families with strong family values, friendships would be restricted"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"usually 12 and likely to be other OD members. ODs‘ network stren gth comes from oper a ting to all intense and purposes, as a cult . They quickly got involved with the education of future elites. The first subjects taught were law and architecture. Education is central to their agenda, fou n ding the elite IESE business scho ol in Spain and many other universities and establishments connected with universities around the world. By 2005 the ―Corporate Works of Opus Dei‖ have cooperated with other people in setting up a total of 608 social initiatives: schools and university res idences (68%), technical or agricultural training centers (26%), universities, business schools and hospitals (6%). Members of OD, with their right wing indoctrination, groomed and selected through their educational establishments and networks, soon held p ositions of influence in the corporate world. Inevitably in the post - war, cold - war world their opportunity would come, Spain was a fertile ground. Twenty years after the Spanish Civil War, Franco‘s isolated economy was in a mess, he asked right - wing econom ists in the financial sector to help him out, all were members of OD. They turned Spain, with the backing of America, into capitalist based economy. A consequence of this was high unemployment, high national debt le a ding to a devalued currency; however the corporate sector, mostly banking and construction, flourished. One company that thrived was Ferrovial. The company was founded in 1952 by Rafael del Pino tosupply railway sleepers to Spain's train network, by the time of Franco‘s death, the company had bu ilt much of Spain‘s infrastructure of rail and tolled roads. The del Pino family still owns 58% of the shares and is among the wealthiest dynasties in the world, with an estimated fortune of £3bn. Rafael del Pino, is thought to be a member of OD, the insti tute in his name is dedicated to promoting the Spanish langu a ge and \"building Spain's future generation of leaders‖, it follows OD morals. He is also on the International Advisory Board of the IESE, the OD Business School. The Spanish economic model, with all its consequences, was copied in South America. Most notable was Argentina, where the policy of developing the corporate sector allowed for representatives of public firms to negotiate flawed contracts with private contractors. Once construction was und er way, it would be ―discovered‖ that the original plan had skipped crucial steps, incre a sing the costs substantially, these costs were paid by the government. The instigator of this policy was OD member Rodolfo Barra, who was justice on the Supreme Court and Minister of Justice under Menem. Flawed contracts and controversial projects that have been resolved in the courts to the contractors favour have not been limited to Argentina. More recently in America there is the Trans - Texas Tollway, in Canada Highwa y 407 and in Britain the PPP of London Underground, these contracts have Ferrovial as a main contractor."},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":"Franco‘s death brought a brief hiatus, but then it was the turn of the EU to continue to finance the same Spanish Armada of government/corporate OD par t nership, which has given Spain such economic strength. This has allowed Spanish policy to become increasingly expansionist, as they sought to formally seek mergers and alliances in the Spanish speaking world, the Spanish g o vernment gave generous tax break s to facilitate this and South American companies, devalued through recent economic policy, made easy and pe r haps though the OD network, ready targets for Spanish expansion. The fina n ce industry led the way with ―30.2% of Spanish - Latin American mergers and acquisitions in this sector during 1997.‖ This continued throughout the late 1990‘s with Grupo Santander‘s total investment in Latin America estimated at more that $4 billion and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya‘s (now Banco Bilbao Viscaya Argentaria) at more than $3 .79 billion in 1997.‖ Not stopping in the Spanish speaking world, this strength has allowed for increased expansion and acquis i tions of the Spanish corporate sector, much in Europe and notably in the UK. Again the focus has been finance, infrastructure, co nstruction and telecoms. A common thread that can be found in the board rooms of these companies is in the CV‘s and history of their board members. Many have links with the D e partment IESE Business School, University of Navarra, Barcelona. Grupo Santander is itself an IESE supporting company. But the IESE is a very esta b lished institution, its alumni can be found in many board rooms, including Calyon [Crédit Agricole] of France, but when one finds such cross fertilising be t ween these institutions, such as Javier Santiso, now chief economist for the OECD Development Centre, one has to question what networks are involved. The financial institutions mentioned are funding the M3 project, however the actual influence any OD network might have had is not easy to determine, e s tablishing OD membership is hard enough. But for Ferrovial it is clearer. Apart from Rafael del Pino being an alleged member of OD, Enrique Fuentes, Ferrovial‘s Head of Market Studies and Analysis Business Unit, is a IESE gradu a te, while Enriq ue Díaz - Rato, CEO - Toll Roads & Car Parks Division, General Manager of 407 ETR in Toronto, Canada (Highway 407), Head of Toll Roads in the USA (Trans - Texas Tollway), Canada, Chile and Ireland, is closely ass o ciated with the Universidad de los Andes in Chile , a university founded as a corporate work of the apostolate of OD. One could almost be certain that Enr i que Díaz - Rato is a key OD link man in the Latin invasion. Opus Dei & the Knights of St. Columbanus Opus Dei first moved into Ireland in late 1949 when a small task - force of Spaniards established themselves in Dublin. They quickly began recruiting st u dents at UCD in Earlsfort Terrace and the College of Surgeons. At the same time they began to make contacts with right - wing Catholics in the Dublin"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":"business and financial world. It is most likely that they formed a very close ass o ciation with the Knights of St. Columbanus and one would expect to a much lesser extent the Knights of Malta. However it should be noted that there are many different orders within I reland and the Catholic Church with which allia n ces could be formed and influence made. Among the Irish founder members were barrister Cormac Burke, medical student; Daniel Cummings and army officer Richard Mulcahy. OD has continued to target the main edu cation esta b lishments of Ireland. At the top of the list is University College Dublin but also The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Trinity College, National University of Ireland, Galway and the University of Limerick. However it is questionable to t he extent of OD penetration into Irish society. There are no up - to - date nu m bers of OD members in Ireland, but a reasonable estimate would be closer to one thousand than two thousand, but that would not include the ̳Cooperators‘ of Opus Dei, who need not be catholic. It is unlikely OD has penetrated Irish politics anywhere near the same level as they have in Spain, Berti Ahern has said that he will ban members of secret societies from ministerial roles, how e ver it is known that members of the Knights of St. Columbanus have been re p resented in the Dail, and it is likely that OD or their ̳Cooperators‘ can be found there also, they must certainly be elsewhere in Irish politics or form part of the mechanics of government and the establishment. Again it is through the law that OD work their way into the establishment. One high profile member was the ultra conservative and influential first chairman of the Arbitration Board; president of the Law Reform Commission. Pr o fessor of Criminal and Constitutional Law at Univ ersity College Dublin, Justice O'Hanlon. His position at UCD would have given access to Ireland‘s future l e aders and elites. One student of law at UCD was Ciaran Feighery who qual i fied as a solicitor in 1971. The Feighery family can be found in many parts of the establishment, and are the major shareholders of SIAC, one of the Ir e lands oldest construction companies. SIAC stated in Cork in 1913 when the company made and laid mastic asphalt, it was known as the South of Ireland Asphalt Company until 1983. Pro fits dipped to €564,000 in 2001 but rose again to its pre - 2001 level of about €4 million at the end of 2002. Almost 70 per cent of the company's €214.68 million turnover in 2002 was transacted in Ireland. The company makes nearly all of its money from civi l engineering and specialist building subcontracting work, it has done very well out of the current road building program. Ciaran Feighery is chairman and other family members are on the board, including Hank Fogarty who had previously been with Dublin Cou nty Council but now is director of SIAC operations and strategic development of the Civil Engineering Division and in particular the Group's particip a tion in major infrastructural and Public Private Partnership [PPP] projects. Also on the board is one Pat Ahern, weather he is related to Bertie has yet to be established. In so many ways the profile of SIAC matches"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"Ferrovial, they s e em well suited partners for the M3 development. Is there an OD link as well? The justification of the M3 route was made in the p lanning stage. Two Irish consultant firms led this work. The first was M.C O'Sullivan & Co Ltd can‘t be touched. As a company it no longer exists as a separate entity, it merged with another in 2005 then merged again beyond recognition in September 2005, i ts staff form part of RPS Group, Ireland‘s largest Civil, Structural and Enviro n mental Engineering Consultancy. The Chairman of RPS Consulting Engineers, Mr Kerry O‘Sullivan has since been elected President of the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ire land. The other consulting company was JB Barry & Partners. This is another company that has grown and merged over time, and is of so significance that last year they got the Taoiseach to open its new branch office in Cork. The company has also been closel y associated with Irish W aterways, the government agency accused of strong OD and Knights of St. Columbanus influence. These consultations would be appointed by the NRA. It is hardly an objective and independent position from the NRA. It was the NRA board who approve and signed contracts and make appoin t ments. One name of note is Fred Barry, who was appointed Chief Executive of the National Roads Authority in 2005. He leads the NRA team in delivering an investment of up to E10 billion over the next five yea rs. If there is any relation between him and JB Barry it has yet to be established. Also on the board of the NRA is Raymond Potterton, who is a property surveyor, auctioneer, dev e loper and investor based in Navan, Co. Meath, he established his company in 1 991 and now, in their own words, dominate the Meath property market. His business partner is Loman Dempsey, brother of Noel Dempsey TD. In November 1998 the NRA moved their road design team into their offices, the le a se was extended until November 2000 as they planned Meath‘s new roads, the N3 must have been part of those plans. The M3 Route Selection reports were published in 2000 and 2001 with the Environmental Impact Statement published in March 2002. In February 2002 Raymond Potterton was appointed to t he NRA Board by Mary O'Rourke, although it is said the real influence in that appoint was Noel Dempsey TD, his appointment was just in time to a p prove and recommend the findings of those reports. Noel Dempsey is a res i dent of Trim Co. Meath, where Raymond Potterton brother, Thomas Potterton, runs the family business there; established in 1886 now T. E. Potterton Real Estate Alliance, a founding member of Real Estate Alliance, one of Irelands premier property groups with a branch network across the country a nd very influential in the farm and property auctioneering and sales.

Trim is now to benefit from an updated rail"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"project, instigated by Noel Dempsey and hoped, perhaps, to relive the current controversy of the M3 project. Other members of the board have yet to be investigated, but collect i vely they know very little about r oads, planning, safety and engineering. Peter Malone Head of the NRA board is Peter Malone, Chairman of the National Roads Au t hority. Peter Malone has been described as a shadowy figure; never one to seek the limelight, his influence is most felt in the ba ckground. He is unlikely to be seen as openly critical of any aspect of State's policy. He has not been r e adily associated with roads or transport Malone but is focused on national competitiveness and the impact an efficient roads infrastructure can have o n it. His reputation was made as 11 years managing director of the Jurys Doyle Hotel Group where he oversaw the successful merger between the Jurys and Doyle groups. He has made calls for more conference centers in Ireland. In February of 2002 he was appoi nted chairman of the National Roads Authority. He has accrued a number of other directorships, including; Bord na Mona plc, a company much favoured by Noel Dempsey, CBRE Gunne Property Group, where one Angus Potterton is a director, Peter Malone is also a Director of a number of other companies including Jurys Doyle Hotels, a company that has many Roche‘s as shareholders and as a director, and Ulster Bank Limited. In addition, he is a member of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector. H e is a member of the board of Hibernian, Ireland‘s premiere insurance group, part of the Aviva Group of companies. Such an appointment might be seen as an award and even greater elevation of status and influence, and puts him in close proximity to other Av iva Group board members, which include; Guillermo de la Dehesa, Currently non - executive chairman of Aviva‘s operations in Spain, non - executive vice - chairman of Goldman Sachs Europe (banking), and a director of Campofrio (consumer), Unión Eléctrica Fenosa ( utility) and Bank Santander Central Hispano (banking). Chairman of the Ce n tre of Economic Policy Research and a member of the Group of Thirty (consu l tative group on international economic and monetary affairs).

Unlike Peter Malone, his predecessor was, Liam Connellan, was an engineer"},{"pageNumber":675,"pageContent":"and knew something about roads. A respected figure, a technocrat and effe c tive administrator and bureaucrat, he was President of Engi neers Ireland, the Irish Academy of Engineering and the Royal Dublin Society. He was appointed chairman of the NRA in 1994, he would have had a strategic role in advising on transport infrastructure in the National Development Plan 2000 - 2006, but clearly h e was not the man to deliver upon it, he does not have the conne c tions, corporate network and financial clout Peter Malone has. Liam Connellan stepped down from his position on 20th December, 2001, before the route s e lection and controversy of the M3 could arise. So why appoint Peter Malone? Clearly it was thought that he would be the man to deliver the corporate fina n ce and cooperate clout to the Celtic Tiger. W hen Charlie McCreevy, Minister for Finance, launched Ireland's National Development Plan 2000 – 20 06 it ma r ked a significant shift to the right. W eather influenced by right wing economists in the UK, South America or Spain, who knows, but his plan relied heavily on public — private partnerships (PPPs) to finance future projects. It is unusual that McCree vy came to this conclusion just when PPP‘s and PFI‘s (Private F i nance Initiatives) where becoming discredited in the UK. Inviting the corporate sector into national capital projects allows the gover n ment to abscond from development, management and financia l responsibil i ties. It also allowed government capital expenditure to be shifted into current expenditure. This might have saved on short term costs, but like buying anything on hire purchase, it pushed up long term costs, as finance is always higher for c orporations then governments and operating companies are also r e quired to turn a profit and a dividend for their investors. Successful PPP/PFI projects can be securitised by the operating company and sold back to investment market. At the start the prime and straight forward projects are offered. Corporations are usually hesitant to become involved in PFI policy. Bidding for contracts is an expensive operation, new forms of contract need to be developed and new relationships between government and business found. Trust is the critical ingredient as neither government nor business can take surprises. The impo r tance of those reliable and known networks and appointments become critical. People like Peter Malone grease those wheels. Once proven the PFI quickly gains momentum and is very effective in getting projects done, as the corpor a tions cherry pick the best projects. Once those projects are gone, the more marginal ones are renegotiated so that the proposing companies can mitigate part of the risk liability back to the government. Until in the end the more costly projects are left to the government. Ultimately the corporations can‘t loose, the government effectively underwrites each project and is willing to make mass i ve commercial compromises to get a projec t done. If only Rodolfo Barra thought of doing things that way."},{"pageNumber":676,"pageContent":"So who appointed Peter Malone? That seems to be have been Minister for Public Enterprise 1997 – 2002 Mary O'Rourke, Fianna Fáil. His position was kept by Séamus Brennan, a UCD trained economist, Fianna Fáil, Minister for Transport June 6 2002 September 29, 2004, and then Martin Cullen, until who was minister until 14th June this year, what a strange one he is, not particula r ly bright, although judging by his deeds, seems to find God in daily life . But focus on Mary O'Rourke, the grand dame of Fianna Fáil, she was on W estm e ath County Council between 1979 and 1987. That would have put her in direct working relationship with her neighbor, the young Noel Dempsey, who was co - opted onto Meath County Cou ncil as a Fianna Fáil councilor in 1977, which he chaired in 1986. In the second general election of 1982 Mary O'Rourke was elected as a Fianna Fáil TD for the Longford - W estmeath constituency, and from 1992 for the new W estmeath constituency. In between ti mes Noel Dem p sey was elected TD for Meath in 1987. The partnership between Dempsey and O'Rourke where instrumental in setting transport policy across the whole of Ireland. With all the preparation that that had gone on in government, the NRA a p pointments, and business connections, no way would anything be left to a planning department that wasn‘t at least bit sympathetic to their masters. Noel Dempsey saw to that, as Minister for Environment & Local Government be t ween July 22, 1997 and June 6, 2002, he was able to implement wholesale changes to the An Bord Pleanála. Firstly appointing John O'Connor was as chairperson for a seven - year term starting from May 6, 2000, he like Noel Dempsey he was also educated at UCD, in the same subject as Dick Roche teaches th ere, Public Administration. The Deputy Chairperson, Brian Hunt, was appointed to the Board on 21st November, from his previous job, Senior Executive Engineer in the Planning Department of Meath County Council, he would be very well known to Noel Dempsey. I n fact 6 out of the current 10 members of the board were originally appointed by Noel Dempsey; the 7th was reinstated by him. All these appointments were in place prior to the pla n ning decisions to route of the M3. The Dempsey Clan Nothing here has been le ft to chance. Not even the laws on planning and development. All have been eased in favour of development, in favour of bus i ness, of corporations, of profit, in enabling contracts to be negotiated and del i vered. The Celtic Tiger continues to grow because i t has been on steroids, and like any beast on steroids, it has started to loose all reason, while poor demented creatures‘ pushers have grown richer and powerful though there trade. One such mafia can be found in Meath. If there is a dominant clan of Meath , then its Dempsey, 14 brothers, with Noel Dempsey as king. He was always going to be king, his star has risen fast and bright, it may still have still"},{"pageNumber":677,"pageContent":"have far to go. In every part of Meath life, you will find a Dempsey, the influe n ce and network is every where, you will find a Dempsey as chief executive of Navan Chamber of Commerce, Meath GAA Chairman, Trim football club, president of Meath golf club, Solicitors Dermot Dempsey, Athboy, Co Meath, i n vestment, mortgage and insurance brokers, travel agents, dr ess shops, and of cause property and development. This network feeds back into the success Noel Dempsey has had in politics, which in turn feeds back to his family and his networks. These networks are simply driven through wealth creation and personnel pow er and authority. But there maybe more hidden networks; it is said that Noel is a very devout Catholic, during the early 70s he attended the Columban Fathers' Irish seminary near his home in Trim, Co Meath, a fact he likes to hide , maybe because there are links to the Knights of St. Columbanus and their links to Opus Dei (it must be noted that the Columban Fathers' seem to be opposed to the M3). Maybe that link maybe is just an innocent one, an opportunity for Dempsey to purse a career in education and care er guidance, which he has excelled in, gaining that most converted of Opus Dei positions, Minister for Education & Science, where he supervised a lame investigation into sexual abuse by the church. One thing for sure, his authority and influence continues to grow and his ne t works are widening. Now he feels comfortable and brave enough to attend and lecture at Opus Dei venues and attack the free press for making things up, a fine comment from a politician who as shown in the Shell Corrib gas di s pute, holds n othing but contempt for those who disagree with him. W hoever is the Minister for Communications, Marine & Natural Resources, thinks that they can control the media, if you can control the media you can control the word, if you want to control the word, it‘ s usually because you have got secrets to hide.

Yet it is one of the very first genocidal acts to be laid at the door of t he Vatican and Judeo - Chr istian establishment. This book exposes the reasons why the Irish Druids and Bards were targeted and how the ir ancient knowledge, which once illumined the world, have been plundered and misused by those who seek to spiritually darke n the world and the minds of men. Clearly, it is not in the interests of the powers behind government and religion for us to realize that culture originated in Western climes and from the pre - diluvian civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria. The desire of th e Vatican mytho g raphers was to falsely situate the seat of culture in the Middle - East and as far away from the Atlantic zone as possible. These mythographers knew full well that Ireland (Eri or Eire) was a remnant of Atlantis and that its primordial \"M e gal ithic\" inhabitants had been evacuated to the Continent en masse. If we, therefore, find (as we do) apparently \"Semitic\" symbols all over the lands of Eur o pe we do so because they came there due to the earlier traversals of Western peoples. "}]
