From th e jungle to the ballroom, it has been done. There are striking examples of this radical process of conversion and acculturation. Anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists have closely observed W ild - Child‟s development with marked approbation, while Darwinists enthusiastically likened the adaptation (however hastened) of the once primitive specimen to the evolutionary ascent of the species. Regardless, of the edification of scientists we can glean one simple point - a man, even a very primitive man, c an have his behavior and personality shaped and changed. His essential character can be altered by the persistent and deliberate application of conditioning techniques. It matters little whether these impositions are natural or unnatural or whether they ar e moral or not. W hat matters is that a man is changed . Once - upon - a - time he was one thing and then, after interference, he becomes something else. Naturally, psychologists are all too aware of the myriad factors that operate to acculturate men and women of the world. They perpetually study and index them. It is quite the subject matter of many discussions as to how humans have been conditioned and shaped, not only by nature but by the artificial environments of their own manufacture. W e are conditioned and w e are conditioners. W hat is slightly less a matter for the conventional staff - room and laboratory is the question of how larger units of society might likewise suffer being controlled and manipulated by external interference. For some reason this question, which is asked by few, has rarely been the topic of open analysis. If we were advocates of the theory of mass control we might point to this relative hesitation as significant proof for the manipulation we suspect does indeed occur. When the subjects of m ass control and social engineering are broached, we encounter various responses. W hen it is proven to exist, Communists and Totalitarians, and those of their ilk, are wont to excuse it saying that it is inevitable. They stress that man, once left to his ow n devices, inevitably behaves as a debauched and reckless miscreant and that social controls are most definitely required to restrain his anti - social drives and to maintain structure and order. There are many such rebuttals and arguments that get pitted ag ainst those who question the problematic topic of human freedom. Perhaps, some will say, man can and should be free in certain areas and not"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"so free in others. Others will muse that man is moving toward some wondrous utopian pinnacle and that his developme nt toward that place of sublime all - knowingness and all - goodness must be caretaken. Social midwifery is necessary , they will cry, since leaving man to his own devices could delay and even prevent the great noetic transcendence. W hatever the case may be, an d whatever arguments for or against social engineering, it is perhaps a needed step forward to entertain the idea that it does occur and that it is an ongoing phenomenon. Although there is some healthy acknowledgement of social control, and some erudite r esearches concerning it, we appear to live in societies that are predisposed to reject and deny conjectures, theories, or revelations concerning the deliberate, artificial, and perhaps malicious manipulation of groups and societies. This denial is the acce pted prerogative of the closed - minded person who prefers to inhabit a “one - season” world and to imagine that he or she is the principle architect of their life - path. It is a comfortable notion to be sure and one that will not be contradicted. For most peop le it cannot be contradicted regardless of evidence presented. It is almost impossible for a hypnotized, mind - controlled, illogical, desensitized, or psychopathic person to be aware of their own error or dementia. And even those normally adjusted people ar e hesitant to see what is in plain view because of the depth of their embedded programming and because they were so young when the conditioning began. It is not conditioning at all to them. It is natural and needed adjustment and no other possible mode of life is any more normal to them. Other kinds of lifestyle within the world - as - is may be desired, and all sorts of modifications are permitted in order to make the mentally and psychically incarcerated feel accommodated within the false reality. But to cond emn the whole rotten edifice that prevents men from true maturation, is to encounter marked agitation and resistance from those who believe they have so much to lose should their ideas of reality be challenged. To offer critiques concerning the five - senses reality is to come up against every one of the innumerable defenses that define the anatomy of the human ego. As the Freudians know, the human ego is little more than a mass of defenses. The Ego - Ideal and Super - Ego (complexes within consciousness) defend against content threatening to ego autonomy. The ego‟s defense apparatus operates in this way even at the cost of higher forms of expression and awareness. The defenses operate to secure the image that one has of oneself, even if the image has been largely implanted by external authorities. Indeed, the Super - Ego has been regarded as the psychic representative of external authority. And interestingly, its nature is binary. There are permissive defenses and prohibitive ones and, like most biotic functions, th ey operate unconsciously. These various ego - settings came into existence due to the titanic forces that beset our ego - consciousness from within and without, from"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the unconscious and from the world. Sanity is a balancing act and, as we say, there is a thin line between genius and madness. This thin line exists also between independence and conformity and between freedom and enslavement. If the human ego senses that the inner and outer threats are intensifying, it tightens and, like a shellfish, retracts from reality. This process is known to psychologists as regression . The egos‟ behavior is then more conservative and irrational . The regressive tendencies, together with many others (denial, repression, identification, sublimation, sado - masochism, aggression, self - destruction, perversity, insanity, etc) are manipulated by autocrats who seek to control the mass of mankind in the same manner as Wild - Child is controlled by an individual master who, like any animal - tamer, expertly displays his two faces - his permi ssive and prohibitive tendencies. Wild - Child is soon trapped in a web from which he can never free himself. He becomes enmeshed in a net tighter yet more tensile than those prepared and laid for his erstwhile forest cousins. Instead of the sun and moon to look down upon him he has the All - Seeing Eye of his imperious master watching his every flex and twitch and peering deeply into the miasma of his mind. The smile he sees greeting him every morning becomes infinitely more sinister and troubling to him than any painful prod or incomprehensible laboratory test. Wild - Child despises the punitive aspects of master but is gratified and appeased when his “correctness” impresses his austere father. Wild - Child develops a “love versus hate” relationship with the maste r. He is attracted and repulsed at the same time. He detests the power his master has over him but covets that kind of power himself. He is subconsciously attracted to it and bides his time, waiting until he can gratuitously exercise control over creatures meeker than himself. Eventually, W ild - Child learns how the power structure works hierarchically and how even his own master is himself a servant of some other agency. He learns that there is pain in store for his tendency to malinger and that there are pu nishments in store for even questioning his lot. In the end he accepts his servitude and grows accustomed to his own place in the great invisible hierarchy. The experiment to change his essential nature occurred early and, despite resistance and recalcitra nt urges, Wild - Child eventually becomes Tame - Child . He learns to adjust and to even be rather shameful of his previous form of existence that was more natural and free. He learns to disapprove of those who exist as he once did. His identification with the object of his own hatred turns him into an oppressor and a dominator. In his ambivalent and schizoid state Tame - Child brings havoc to the world but his ego - censors prevent him from apprehending himself as the cause. The world‟s problems are mysterious in o rigin and have nothing to do with him. He may sensually deplore what he sees and he may try to topically remedy some of the blatant injustices and affronts he encounters, but looking deeply into causes and motives is certainly not his forte. Endeavors of t hat kind leave him"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"feeling ineffectual and frustrated and he prefers to leave that kind of thing to others. His hours and days of sensual experimentation with the phenomena of the world must not be halted by thoughts concerning meaning . Life is life. It do es not have meaning. Such becomes the credo of the Tame - Child. If and when his personal ideas of reality come under attack from external adversity he can escape into drugs and sexual gratification. He can eat, drink, party, get smashed, and put his blues b ehind him. The world is just a place he is in. It is outside and is rather threatening. It is full of foreign things he often has to pretend he likes. It does not belong to him and he is not its caretaker. That too is someone else‟s job. Freedom makes him uneasy and bored. He does not know what to do with it and prefers not to have it. He invents cunning arguments to cover the fact that what he really desires is freedom from freedom. He feigns lamentation about the absence of freedom, valor, and independenc e, but secretly he despises these things and is envious of those who appear to possess them. Above all, Tame - Child does not wish to think too deeply or revitalize his own ideas of reality. He finds that he can exist without being so bothered, and this know ledge brings him great satisfaction. He discovers that society will reward him for his avoidance and lack of attention to the questions that matter. Tame - Child does not need to think because someone will always be there to tell him what to do and how to do it. The routines, uniforms, repetitiveness, and conformity are very comforting. Doing what everyone else does and thinking as everyone else thinks is psychically elating. It is Tame - Child‟s satori. Inwardly of course, beneath the censors of the ego, a tit anic war rages. Repressed emotions seethe and boil like lava. Although Tame - Child occasionally feels this conflict he has been trained to ignore it. The training he has received from others has been embodied and now he expertly trains and disciplines himse lf. He is far removed from any inner authentic voice and he lives on the periphery of true selfhood. He is guided by the “hand rails” of society and not by his own dark inner voice that he believes is a dangerous source of anxiety and conflict. He hides in the light and gets busy with the phantasmagoric world of appearance. He is making friends and being active and productive. He becomes a relentless over - achiever and his many physical successes prove his virility and value. He has been given his small patc h of territory in the world of colors and light and it all comes to mean a great deal to him. He too must be vigilant and see to it that nothing enters to threaten the function of the machines upon which he has grown dependent. Nothing short of death will make him relinquish his place and he will arm himself against all trespassers whether they are people or new ideas. His identification with the power of his masters is perpetually weighed against his need for their approval and against his fear of destruct ion at their hands. He decides to obey and conform, and to be in the company of those people who do likewise. As long as he himself does not think of his conformity as conformity, and as long as his"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"identification and allegiance is complete and inviolate, his life can proceed relatively untroubled. ◊◊◊ The Apocalypse Clearly, it appears that we are relatively unaware of the pervasiveness and subtlety of the mechanisms of mass control. Even though there have been many clear examples of it before our eyes du ring the last 200 years, it remains a very peripheral study and not one that is commonly broached. Despite this reticence, and the preoccupation with more palatable subjects, there is a growing interest in the ways human beings are controlled. The reason f or this slow awakening has to do with mankind‟s so - called “darker side.” It is our awareness of the catalog of crime and injustice that often succeeds in prompting us to investigate human nature more closely. Astrologically, this need to see beneath the su rface of things is “ruled” by the planet - archetype Pluto. The energy represented by this planet - archetype (that of deconstruction, ending, and revelation) will be increasing in intensity during the early part of the new millennium. This increase will be ex perienced as very uncomfortable by people who have lived their entire lives under “consensus trance” and who have not developed the mental equipment to objectively critique their lifestyles or environment. The challenge that “Plutonic” energy augurs is nec essary for the return of hygiene to the now very toxic collective and personal psyche. Many of the tribulations that we will see socially, politically, ideologically, and psychologically, will be occurring as a result of this intensification of “Plutonic” light. Indeed, as competent astrologers know, one long Precessional Age (that of Pisces) is coming to its close. Another Age (the Aquarian ) is set to begin in a relatively short time from now and we are presently in the middle of the transitional or “cusp” phase. The Maya priests, the celestial time - keepers of South America, referred to this period of transition as the “Age of Revealing.” The author of the Book of Revelation referred to it as a time of “Apocalypse.” This word connotes the removal of a leath er cover and is a reference to the human persona or mask rather than to any other binding or cover. Jesus said: When you see your likeness, you rejoice. But when you see your images which came into existence before you, which neither die nor are made manif est, how much will you bear? - (Gospel of Thomas) What you do not bring forth from within you, will destroy you Jesus said, \"Whoever knows the all but fails to know himself lacks everything - (Gospel of Thomas)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Age of Revealing (or of Apocalypse) is a time when the masks of the false are removed, and when man gets his chance to see who and what he is without filter or censor. W orks such as this one, which delve into hidden origins, are symptomatic of this phase - shift into the time when men get the rare chance to find out what has been kept from them, and to have the answers concerning their true origins and destiny. Primarily, the presence of Plutonic (and also Uranian) energy hearkens in a Spirit of Rebellion . This spirit comes to assist in the process of revelation. It also compels us to resist conformity. As a result of its presence the autocratic forces in the world, that contrive to maintain group - think and who benefit from mankind‟s unquestioning obedience, become even more tyrannous and aggressive. They manufacture more ingenious devices to ensure that people do not go AW OL. Pluto signals major revisions in the social order, and large scale maneuvers from the power - brokers within governments. The harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity. And sh all cast them into a furnace of fire - (Matt 13) In extreme cases the presence of this Spirit of Rebellion can make for radical changes affecting every facet of our lives. It can bring events to a head and demand a phase of total deconstruction in which al l the accepted customs and idioms that we take for granted, on all fronts, are abolished. As said, this particular eventuality will greatly threaten and compromise the masses of people in the world who will feel stripped naked and bereft of security or pur pose. The initial challenges regarding the integration of “Plutonic” energy and the countdown to the end of the Age of Pisces involve the realization that, like Wild - Child, societies also have their “temperaments” molded and fashioned. They too are like cl ay upon the wheel of the potter. W ild - Child, however, knows his master. Society‟s units are not so informed. The brain, the world, and the elements of civilization, operate synergistically. As the philosophers (Ken W ilber, Arthur Koestler, and others) have pointed out, the Universal Order operates as a holarchy and not a hierarchy. The same thing goes for human minds that once had a deep rapport with the Universal Order. It is time, therefore, to reconnect the little cog with the larger, and to reconnect th e umbilical threads that join each of us to the everlasting matrix that provides all that is needed. W e must obey the Law of Reciprocity and realize that what we sow is most definitely what we reap. W e must abandon the dysfunctional tendencies that bring r uin to our relationships, our selves, and our world. Like children we have sought to prepare a dish and"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"have exchanged sugar for salt because, in our innocence, we believed because they look alike they must taste alike. So it is with our error over the lik eness of love and power. Therefore, it is hardly a surprise that we are not enjoying the dish we have prepared. The dish is civilization as it now exists. W e have forgotten that our sovereign duty is to leave the world in a better condition than when we ea ch entered it. W e have been poor house guests and should not, therefore, be amazed or resentful when the host penalizes us for our egregious neglect and property damage. This is where humility and true contrition are required. W e forgive ourselves since we understand that we acted from ignorance and that this ignorance has its roots in the ancient past and in sinister crimes of biological invasion that caused deep and permanent trauma to our being. Because of that violation and trauma, we reluctantly accept ed the kind of unsustainable anti - natural lifestyles provided by our imperious masters, the makers of history and the manipulators of mankind‟s destiny. The winding down of the Age of Pisces can hearken in a phase of cleansing and judgment for those most p olluted and spiritless. It challenges all men to realize that true social and political freedom can never be made a reality unless the thinking human mind is free, and unless the heart and emotions are moral and hygienic. The acorn crushed by the hand that plants it will not become an oak and, likewise, a world order created by human devils will not become Utopia. The ending of the Age can mean the end of the machinations of warlords and aristocratic tyrants. It can hearken in a time of enhanced freedom for those who sorely deserve it. As a result, it may be challenging for men of the future to cope with this new found freedom and with the Spirit of Rebellion that ushers it forth. The real thing is not the same as the relative liberty or sham that we present ly experience. It is not the state of being senior prefect in a prison. It is something far more rare, exceptional, and fragrant. Most men‟s souls cry out for that long lost fragrance. It is returning once more and will again take root in the world after t he rank weeds of cruelty and injustice are uprooted and incinerated. ◊◊◊ The True Origins of the Secret Societies Benjamin Disraeli, the first Jewish Prime Minister of Victorian Britain, wrote in his novel Coningsby : \"The world is run by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes. \" Disraeli was aware that the world is controlled by powerful secret societies and fraternal orders whose agendas and schemes have little to do with the best interests of humankind. Although these particular orders do not necessarily conceal their identiti es,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"they do endeavor to conceal whatever goes on behind the doors of their various occult lodges and establishments. Naturally, exclusive orders do not wish their strange practices, rites, and agendas to be openly disclosed, and they excel in the manufactu re of many a guileful strategy and device designed to ensure secrecy. As one Freemasonic member and author reveals: Freemasonry is labyrinthine. It is full of puzzles, conundrums, misspellings, corruptions, cryptic clues, and simple salutes, childish codes , contrivances, circular paths, roads that sometimes lead nowhere, walls appearing to be ten feet thick yet giving way easily to the lightest touch in the right spot, riddles to be solved, numerous passwords, an allegorical, highly symbolical, double - enten dre storyline worthy of the best latter - day spy writers, protected by secret signs and symbols and a myriad of enigmas to be confronted...In the labyrinth that is Freemasonry there is a center where rests its holy grail. Many have tried to find it only to re ach dead ends - Leon Davin ( The Ritual: The Greatest Story Never Told ) One of most important themes of our work will be to expose the true origins and agendas of the world‟s most powerful secret societies and the religions they have given birth to. This wo rk endeavors to demonstrate how they have used religion and politics to further their nefarious anti - human schemes. Our primary intention is to inform the ordinary citizen of certain occult facts that are not even known to those members within the hierarch ies of the various secret societies of the planet. The true origins of the Masonic Order, Knights Templars, Rosicrucians, and Illuminati, etc, have been carefully guarded secrets and are largely unknown even to those serving within these societies. The Blu e Degrees are but the outer court...of the temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretation. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended that he shall imagine tha t he understands them...The true explanation is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry (those of the 32nd and 33rd degrees) - Albert Pike (Grand Master of American Scottish Rite Freemasonry and Head of the Illuminati) These good folk swell our numbe rs and fill our money - box. Set yourselves to work; these gentlemen must be made to nibble at the bait...But this sort of people must always be made to believe that the grade they have reached is the last - Adam Weishaupt (Founder of the Bavarian Illuminati) Behind the division of humanity stand those Enlightened Ones whose right and privilege it is to watch over human evolution and to guide the destinies of men...This they do through the implanting of ideas in the minds of the world thinkers, so that these idea s in due time receive recognition and eventually become controlling factors in human life. They train the members of the New Group of World Servers in the task of changing these ideas into ideals. These in turn become the desired objectives of the thinkers and are then taught to the powerful middle class and worked up into world forms of governments or religion, thus forming the basis of the new world order - Alice A. Bailey (Fabian, Occultist, Author. Head of the Lucis Trust)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Naturally the power - elites, an d their minions who apparently believe the world to be their personal play - pen, have a great deal to lose should the “Under - Classes,” or ordinary men and women of the world, learn about the subtle nature of the psychic and social control that operates all around them and which is hidden in plain sight. However, the task of revealers is made considerably more difficult due to \"consensus trance\" and the knee - jerk fear reactions that automatically inhibit a mutilated and conditioned mind. The Servants of Truth know from experience how few friends are won, if and when they should endeavor to expose the dirty little secrets of religion‟s upper echelons. Nevertheless, a Servant of Truth is not permanently daunted by the discomfort caused by the presence and proxim ity of truth. The Servant of Truth is aware that it is easier to cut oneself with a blunt knife rather than with a sharp one, and that the price of ignorance is ultimately far greater than the price paid for knowledge. The Servant of Truth knows that freed om is never free and that silence is most definitely consent. He comes to realize that, on the great board game of life, if he fatally chooses to not occupy the white squares of knowledge, he will be manipulated by those who will. The only good is knowled ge and the only evil ignorance - Socrates The task of exposing the secrets of secret societies is somewhat complicated since it also inevitably involves the exposure of the secrets of religion. And, since religion is intimately connected to politics, the t ask cannot but include an exposure of the secrets of politics. Although it is vain to expect a single book to investigate all the dark highways and byways of these politics and religion we can, at least, make a zealous start and wait to see where the river of ink leads. Therefore, it is not one torch that we must light, and not one shadowy labyrinth that we must explore, but three . Like a newly initiated masonic neophyte we too must negotiate three steps on our ascent toward truth and empowerment. May our d estination be the same as that decreed by masons. May our three lonely roads lead us to the one altar - the altar, the shrine of Truth. Truly, it is not hyperbole to say that we are, during the years of this new millennium, going to experience the greatest of revelations concerning the most important and complex human mysteries. W e can expect many a layer of deception to be peeled away and jettisoned. Some of us may be glad and grateful for the coming of the light of revelation. Others among us may be start led by the proximity of such knowledge and many will be deeply threatened by its presence. Many will not wish to see in themselves the dirt that this light will surely reveal. For these types there are always the churches and the priests. There will always be those confessors in black to hide behind and who, with their words and incense, can appease the profound inner angst of egos that are fast approaching the end of their cycle of existence."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" ◊◊◊ The Spirit of Rebellion During times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act - George Orwell Fortunately, the celestial clock is with us and with the Spirit of Revelation . Alfred Lord Tennyson‟s “wild bells” are already begin ning to ring out the old, the vile, and the degenerate. In this age of “Solution - Think” we will be given the chance to dispel the ideological lies and fallacies by which we have been mentally and spiritually infected and enslaved. As the Maya prophecies in form us, we have been, since the year 1999, in the so - called “Age of Revealing.” This is a time of literal “Apocalypse” when the masks of the false begin to come down. This period of catabolic action and collective catharsis will be deeply threatening to t hose morally unhygienic souls who have long profited from the ruin of their fellows, and to those consummate narcissists who have advanced at the expense of others around them. The approaching end game is especially threatening to those connoisseurs of pow er whose insatiable penchant for destruction and deception has contaminated the world. The voices of their innumerable victims cry out from the deep places but will soon be quieted and appeased by Lady Justice. It is not difficult for us to acknowledge the wisdom in George Orwell's warning of how telling the truth can often be an act of rebellion. Indeed, this work is meant to be controversial and revisionist. It is a testament to, and for, freedom . It is composed in the Spirit of Rebellion - rebellion agai nst ancient tyranny. Its contents are controversial, seditious, iconoclastic, and even treasonous. It is, however, more than a play on words to declare that there is no such thing as treason against the treasonous ! Need it be stressed that there is no such thing as freedom in a “Bastille of Lies,” the dark shadow of which overlooks a landscape of existential misery and moral pestilence. The purpose of our work is to counter the Orwellian boot that has been stamping upon the face of all humanity for millenni a. It is our intention to counter this violence with a form of intellectual violence of our own. It is our intention to sweep away the cobwebs that enshroud the mind, and to remove the thorns of delusion that enswathe the human heart. W hat may come after o ur efforts is not a primary concern. W e are not interested in building new world systems but confine our energies to the destruction of old ones that must be rivaled and logically toppled at this time.

The toil of uprooting weeds consumes every waking moment.

Indeed, though the sky may for a while be blackened with the smoke of our weed - fires we find a certain rare fragrance in such effusion. Although it may not be the aroma of roses the perfume from the burning pyres of evil and ignorance is not wholly intolerable, and is not without its own aesthetic quality. From the embers of such pyres we can even be afforded a clairvoyant intimation of th e future world to arise. It is the world that once was long ago, that existed once - upon - a - time - pure, effulgent, realized, and magnificent - one not of devils, demons, gods, kings, saints, or sinners, but of men, free inwardly and outwardly, able and will ing to holistically and reverently explore the mystery of themselves and of the planet that has housed them throughout the troubled ages and that has long preserved the secret of their salvation. The enemy we face, that has haunted our world for millennia, will not concede of its own will. It will not yield or even give ground. It is in fear but has combined its fear with occult knowledge and this combination makes it lethal in the extreme. It seeks to humiliate the good, the pure, and the virtuous. It is t he enemy of truth and of freedom. It cannot triumph since the force it vainly opposes is eternal and self - sustaining. The problem of evil is, however, not solved with a clenched fist but with an open, receptive, and mutable mind. These characteristics are represented by the Archangel Michael and his mighty sword, by Arthur‟s Excalibur , by Robin‟s flaming arrows, and by Merlin‟s serpentine wand. We overcome the direst enemies with knowledge and not might. W e seek revelation to prevent revolution, to overcome evil with the force of our example not by the example of our force, but by psychological weaponry, and by total conviction in our cause and sovereign power. As said above, we understand lucidly that freedom is never free, and that silence is most definite ly consent. Regardless of whether we are joined by others, or not, we proceed on our quest with conviction. There is the fairest of damsels to be saved and a Serpent‟s blood to redden our shields - that is all! The value from exposing the corruption and in trigue of the cruel inhuman leviathans of religion and politics cannot be understated or under - estimated. However, given today's apathy we might question what good will ultimately be derived from our efforts. Tragically, it appears that the human race has managed to arrive at a place where it is so jaded and sense - infatuated that it really could not care whether Jesus ever existed or not. W e can go so far as to say that it is not Jesus and his history or authenticity that interests most church - going Christi ans. It is what Jesus can do for them emotionally and physically that matters most. The average \"believer\" is not truly concerned with god‟s nature or with god‟s mysteries. He is merely concerned with what god can do for him and how god might make his sad mediocre life less insipid. The average believer is not concerned about the emotions his Christ may have felt when he was betrayed with a kiss by a man for whom he was ready to give up"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"his own life. No, the average believer wants Jesus to do something for him. He wants Jesus to act on his behalf and to provide various physical, emotional, and spiritual comforts and securities. Yes, what a great pleasure a mentally and emotionally destitute (“meek”) man finds knowing that for the nominal fee of blind obedien ce his jealous god will fulfill his needs and also dispense hell and damnation to his enemies. W ho could pass up such a platinum deal? The day that Jesus and god fail to cut it, the guru gimmick - merchant on the block will do just as well. Christian moralis ts may reflect upon the manner in which their own grandiloquent religious espousals have fostered the same pernicious disaffection in society that they vehemently attribute to atheism and materialism. Show me a force which binds today's humanity together w ith half the power it possessed in those centuries...And don't try to browbeat me with your prosperity, your riches, the rarity of famine and the speed of communications! The riches are greater but the force is less; there is no more a binding principle; e verything has grown soft, everything and everyone grown flabby! - Fyodor Dostoevsky ( The Idiot ) Yes, religion is little more than a narcissist‟s materialism . The singer and songwriter John Lennon once predicted that his band - the Beatles - would become \"m ore famous\" than Jesus. Given that his iconoclastic forecast included other candidates within the entertainment business, as well as his own band, his strange prediction has actually turned out to have been quite accurate. Although we may resist accepting it, the youth could care less about Jesus and God. The young ones who appear to care are often forced to do so as a consequence of the inevitable indoctrination process of punitive parents and guardians. Left to their own devices they prefer to choose Mari lyn Manson and Snoop Doggy Dog as mentors, models, and way - showers. And perhaps they could care less about the Sacred Heart for good reason. After all, what does it really matter if a special man of god did walk the Earth thousands of years ago? W hat does it matter that he had enemies and that he sacrificed his life for what he believed? W hat does it matter that he had despots and betrayers on his trail? W hat does it matter if he had magical powers to heal and reveal, or that he rose into heaven after his t orture and death? Actually, to a rational mind, none of this matters at all. It works excellently as a great tale, a ripping yarn, a Hollywood super - drama, and that is about all. Only the emotionally disturbed, psychologically infirm, or intentionally mali gn, have taken it to mean more than this. W e do not need to recount the repulsive biographies or histories of so - called saints, kings, popes, and evangelists, or recount the splendidly erudite theories of Freud, Jung, Reich, and other psychoanalysts to rei nforce this truism. No, few care or have ever cared about the factuality of the bible‟s convoluted stories. Inwardly, subconsciously, most people know the improbability of such tales. It is apathy and conformity that motivate men to accept such fictions. T he story of Jesus"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the god, or of Jesus the man, is interesting to fewer rational people, and there is nothing amiss with that. A ruined mansion can always do with renovation, and so can the human mind. The story of truth, of god, and of the divine within man should not be fixed in the special past but in the special present - in the moment that is. Moreover, when we do our historical homework we find out that the story of Jesus is no more dramatic and miraculous, no more pathetic and majestic than the stor y of other masters of knowledge and Servants of Truth. W ho dares to declare the story of Jesus Christ to be any more captivating or inspiring than that of Imhotep, Apollonius of Tyana, Siddhartha, Milerepa, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharishi, Sarma d, Lao Tzu, or of Jiddu Krishnamurti? And, dare we ask how many people in today‟s manic world care a jot for these bright lights of past times? For every Christ and Muhammad there are a thousand other god - men, born of virgins, imbued with the deepest wisdo m, and enamored with a divine mission. India is filled with such men and women today. So let it be known that there is nothing truly unique about the life of Jesus Christ. The only thing unique about Christ is the lengths to which the Cult, that has adopte d his name, has gone to suppress the truth and to foist their unsustainable sectarian beliefs upon the world. The Christian zeal for brutal oppression and its violent conversion of non - believers, its penchant for false promises, its expertise with deceptio n, and its ability to spawn the vilest of human - monsters, make it unique in the world. It is our mission to assist in the removal of the insinuated theological viruses that infect the minds and hearts of men and that prevent human beings from realizing th eir own perfection and from tapping into their own divinity. Our sharp tool for accomplishing this psychological surgery is deconstruction . Our endeavor is a catabolic one and, therefore, it flies in the face of those desirous of remaining moribund within the emotional and mental comfort zones. Our deconstructive model and approach reveals the means and mechanics of how the authority of man‟s intrinsic Selfhood has been molested by the connoisseurs of deception with a great deal to lose should the subjects under their hypnotic power awaken and become ignited by the Spirit of Rebellion that lies dormant within them. It is this spirit, after all, that is exemplified by the great saviors of the world. All of them, from Tonatiuh to Odin, from Apollonius and Socr ates to Christ, were rebels, iconoclasts, and outcasts. And yet, each was sent to the world by the higher power to execute the will of the so - called “Holy Spirit.” Rebellion, the hallmark of all Servants of Truth is, therefore, a true service to the Holy S pirit.

Little wonder that they obscured the actual significance of the Holy “Ghost.” ◊◊◊ The Holy Spirit and the Age of Revealing Do you deny me the entrance to heaven, I who have at last learned the mystery of myself - Egyptian Mystery School legend Although most Christians will be loath to accept what we say, it is in accordance with tru e Christian precepts to identify this so - called “Holy Spirit” (the third spiritual essence and principle within the Trinity) as our own selfhood . The Holy Spirit was referred to as \"W isdom\" (Sophia), and was equated with transcendent knowledge. This knowle dge may extend to the son of god, and then to god himself, but it must first begin with self - knowledge . This is literally what Sophia of the Trinity is - knowledge of the self. The conspiring forces that sought to make this self - knowledge taboo, and who d istorted and complicated our understanding and veneration of the true Holy Spirit, were attempting to blot out the self from the Holy Trinity and from the spiritual canon. To imagine the Holy Spirit to be some vague presence, or some indefinable aspect of the Virgin Mary, a white ethereal dove, an abstract metaphysical principle, or an inexplicable mystery, suited the desires of the Christian priestarchy but denied their flock their most valuable key to the gates of salvation. W hat we were not told is that without the key of knowledge of the self, the other keys, should they even come into our possession, are worthless. It is this journey of self discovery that true mystics embark upon and that sincere philosophers aspire to. But this safari, this trek into the jungles of the Self was regarded as a reprehensible and even lethal enterprise to those plotting the charts of official religion. And so, it was decided that the first and highest priority lay in instilling the wholly false notion that man receives enl ightenment from without, after penance and after the performance of certain fixed rites overseen by the priests that he must unquestionably revere, serve, and sustain. The \"Holy Ghost\" of the ensconced priestarchs is something that \"descends\" upon a man fr om outside. It is not something that awakens within his being. It is this false theological premise that has sent men out of their own being and into the hands of deceivers. In truth, there is no enlightenment to be found outside oneself. There is nothing worth having or attaining that does not originate within one's own being. If there is such a thing as enlightenment it cannot be found in the company of gurus, priests, or experts. Only its antithesis can be found in such company.

Such entries were probably either remnants of the heavily plagiarized Gnostic canon or clues left by higher minded clerics silently traveling upon their own personal \"Siddhartha Roads.\" Without father, without mother, without human descent; His life has neither beginning nor end; but, as the Son of God, abides as a Holy Priest continually - (Hebrews 7:3) Many stand outside at the door, but it is only the solitaries who will enter into the bridal chamber - Jesus Christ ( Gospel of Thomas ) The knowledge of god, or even of the son of god, is worthless to the one who does not deeply know him or herself. The chaos and debauch in our world is the result of this lack of self - kn owledge. The casualties from drugs and from false spiritual paths and teachers also stand as testimony to our assertion and thesis. ...a distorted development of autonomy is the root cause of the pathological and, ultimately, evil element in human beings - Arno Gruen ( The Betrayal of the Self: The Fear of Autonomy in Men and Women ) The most strongly enforced of all known taboos, is the taboo against knowing who or what you really are behind the mask of your apparently separate, independent, and isolated ego - Alan Watts ( The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are ) The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will often be lonely, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself - Fredrick Nietzsche Alas, I can see that you do not know what it means to be alone. Wherever there have been powerful societies, governments, religions, or public opinions - in short, wherever there was any kind of tyrann y, it has hated the lonely philosopher; for philosophy opens up a refuge for man where no tyranny can reach: the cave of inwardness, the labyrinth of the breast; and that annoys all tyrants - Fredrick Nietzsche ( Schopenhauer as Teacher ) Yes, to jump over t he bridge of selfhood hoping to land on the ship leaving for paradise, is to fall and drown for sure in the cold, swirling, demon - infested depths of perplexity and insanity. “Self - Realization is necessary before God - Realization” was the motto of the Vedant a masters and Brahmanic sages. “Know Thyself” were the words at the Delphic Oracle in Greece.

W e understand that a rational man cannot say, like Christ is meant to have done, that: \"I and my Father are One,\" unless we are each first one within ourselves to begin with. The \"Father\" is complete and if we are ourselves not complete then how can we possibly be one with him or with anyone? The Christian who imagines that being one w ith the Father implies the abnegation of selfhood is a sadist to his own being. He commits a cardinal sin with just this kind of illogical thinking. How can a mere nothing , a human zero, merge with god? After all, who is it that comprehends this state of o neness? Logically, it is only a self that can merge or bond with god's self. Anything else is fantasy. When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will know that you are the sons of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then y ou are in poverty, and you are poverty - ( Gospel of Thomas ) You yourself are even another little world and have within you the sun and the moon and also the stars - Origen (Church Father, 3rd Century AD) You are the temple of God.

Thanks to orthodox religion and its anti - human dogmas this sadism to the self is rampant throughout the world. W e can find it in the East and in the W est. Religion, government, and corporations, exist to rape men of their inherent sovereignty and to crush the Spirit of Rebellion . These forces are obscene contradictions to the true Holy Spirit. The church, in particular, is not the agent of the Holy Spi rit but its greatest enemy. A careful reading of the bible reveals how many passages are given over to the question of slavery and how endorsed it is by god and his terrestrial agents. Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.

The ob ject of my investigation is to rectify this, by deconstructing the maze of lies that has captured and bound our sanity and our truth - starved souls. Perhaps, we can now understand why it is that a man cannot be forgiven for sins committed against the “Holy Spirit,” that is, against his own Higher Self . And perhaps we can understand why it was so vitally important for early Judeo - Christian hierarchs and mythmongers to obscure the identity of this feminine third party in the Blessed Trinity, symbolized by the Gnostic (and Scorpionic) dove. And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven - (Matt 12:31) Jesus said: ―He who blasphemes against the Father will be forgiven, and he who blasphem es against the Son will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either on earth or in heaven‖ - ( Gospel of Thomas ) Yes, remove the Self from the Trinity, and from the ontology, and your demonic schemes of domination will succeed beyond your wildest expectations. Crush the Self and your end is assured. Revive the Self and man gets his chance to follow the bright dove homeward to his refuge of truth and understanding. Symbolically speaking, we find it more than suggest ive that the dove was chosen to represent the third party of the Blessed Trinity since it is not a Christian emblem. It is a very ancient pagan symbol. The origin of the mystical symbolism of the dove comes from astrology and from the gnosis of the ancient stellar cults. The dove is, in fact, the symbol for the sign of Scorpio, which is one of the two signs of the zodiac connected to the Spirit of Rebellion . So, we find it more than significant that the symbol chosen to represent the higher self - the true Holy Spirit - should relate directly and undeniably to the spirit and act of Rebellion, and to the Spirit of Contradiction . W e find it to be more than significant that the bible should proclaim it to be the direst and most irredeemable of sins to contradic t or violate the will of this Holy Spirit. Since we have been committing this \"sin\" nonstop, age after age, it follows that we should indeed find ourselves struggling and choking in the webs of our own making. It stands to reason that humans are to be foun d floundering in a squalid swamp of non - issues, existing as prisoners in their own palaces, lacking the intelligence to know the danger they face. Therefore, we make it our task to draw attention to the significance of this sin against the self. From the e nding of this most mortal of sins comes a new rapport with that true comforter, that eternal daemon (guardian) that has long worked for our awakening and arrival. Now that this is understood, we are in a good position to finally see the battlefield and the rival factions. Because of our new understanding we grow proficient in determining who the real misleaders are. They are those men who would condemn, stifle, and even obliterate this supernal Spirit of Rebellion . They are those who would fashion for us"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"op pressive political leviathans, inhuman psychopathic corporations, and repressive religions, to ensure that the spirit that is essential to our existence is driven forth into the wilderness never to return.

Thankfully, the one thing that never dies in this world, at any time or in any place, is the Spirit of Rebellion . It endures fo rever in someone or other, in some hermit, or poet, musician, playwright, or filmmaker. It has been beaten and crushed many a time but it is going nowhere . W e can be thankful for that. W e can, therefore, look to and rely upon this great spirit for our salv ation. W e can learn to rely upon the Spirit of Rebellion physically and socially and we can also learn to rely upon it mentally. W e need to become accustomed to the Spirit of Rebellion because it is already moving in the world and will soon make itself viv idly apparent. W hen the dove descends into our world it will, however, don a quite different garb than the one we may be familiar with. The dove is merely a metaphor for the deconstructive energy that is astrologically symbolized by the sign of Scorpio and its ruling planet Pluto. In psychological terms, Pluto is the “Shadow.” Symbolically speaking, it is nature‟s psychic surgeon or hygienist that arrives to cleanse the soul of its toxicity and repressed debris so that it may be chastened and virginal enoug h to perhaps receive the clear elixir of truth. That Plutonic Shadow, the emissary of the Holy Spirit, has already been manifesting in the world and it will continue to do so for a decade or more. Its presence is the harbinger of truth and above all - free dom . Therefore, only those imprisoners of human minds and souls have something to fear from the coming \"Age of Revealing.\" As the Scorpionic thirteenth card of the Tarot shows ( Rider - Waite Deck ) it is only the popes and kings, and their lieutenants, who wi ll be leveled before Pluto‟s great steed. It is only the emotionally, morally, and spiritually toxic amongst us who have something to fear from the approach of Pluto's silver scythe. The rest can benefit from, and even enjoy, the healing that comes after t he pestilence, the plague, and the offending virus has been eradicated. All we have to remember is that everything in our world is cleaned - our bodies, our cars, and our carpets. Only our emotions and psyche remain perpetually neglected and unhygienic. Th is is what the energy represented by Pluto comes in to confront and clear. There is a reason why the word sanity is etymologically related to the word sanitary. The sanitary mind is sane, and the unsanitary mind is, by definition unsane , and even insane. T he gigantic catastrophes that threaten us today are not elemental happenings of a physical or biological order, but psychic events.

The environmental crisis is rooted in the psychological crisis of the modern individual.

W hat many paranoiacs, fear - mongers, and doomsday merchants imagine to be the countdown to extinction is actually the countdown to freedom. What many falsely imagine to be the instigation of a tyrannical “New Wo rld Order” is, in fact, going to be the removal of all such draconian order from the world, forever. The saber - rattling and war - mania of the world‟s power - elites is but a subconscious fear - reaction to the inevitable approach of change, a desperate and futi le attempt to offset the coming Plutonic storms that will demolish all that is infirm and toxic from the soul and from the world.

One of the fundamental correspondences involves the planet of rebellion, Uranus. Uranus is the planetary “ruler” of the sign of Aquarius and is “exalted” (of greatest power) in Scorpio. “New Age” philosophy expounds the idea that we are gradually approaching the so - called “Age of Aquarius.” However, this is not the place to explicate the details of astrological prophecy or expound on the sundry notions regarding this future age. I merely wish to highlight the rebellious traits symbol ized by the sign of Aquarius and the planet - archetype Uranus. It is this Spirit of Rebellion , and what may come of its manifestation, that is of primary interest to us. We would rather forgive the evil proliferating all around us than the rebellion against it, which we mistake for the true evil - Arno Gruen ( Betrayal of the Self ) Presently, as we write, the planet Uranus (ruler of Aquarius) is moving through (transiting) the last sign of the zodiac called Pisces. Like all signs of the zodiac, Pisces has bot h positive and negative traits associated with it. This conjunction of Uranus in Pisces provides the insightful and intuitive with a peek into the forthcoming Age of Aquarius. Those who have adroit “Pattern - Recognition” skills, and who are “Symbolically Li terate,” will perceive in today‟s world subtle forecasts of what is to come in the future age. If thou wilt know the invisible, open wide thine eyes on the visible - Kabalistic Adage Aquarius and Uranus rule the spirit of youth that is akin to the Spirit o f Rebellion . The coming of Uranus can be compared to a meeting between an extremely caffeinated and ticked - off Bruce Lee meeting an extremely hyper and histrionic Jackie Chan. As we can imagine, there won‟t be much left of the furniture after they get thro ugh talking over their problems. Uranus is the planetary ruler of the famous Fool card in the Tarot. The Fool represents the innocent, sensitive, vital mind that is ever receptive, unconditioned, mutable, and free. He is the androgynous one who travels wit hout a load of attachments and who allows neither fear nor memory to interfere with his mutable, omnidirectional journey of experience. He perfectly embodies the Taoist's Wei Wu Wei (accomplishment without action). To him, the world always appears new, fre sh, interesting and magical. This does not mean that the Fool does not also see the injustice and perversity that exists around him. He sees all the suffering and sorrow and he laments it deeply. His spirit is, after all, Plutonic and Uranian. His spirit i s free and also deeply human, but his solutions to problems are of a grass - roots variety. He despises complexity, and prefers solutions that are ingenious yet simple and comprehensible. The Plutonic - Uranian mind does not require debates, pie charts, graphs , boardroom decisions, or ten - year plans to cut through “Gordian Knots,” and move proverbial mountains. The Uranian does not need to take a poll of the opinions of others to know what he should believe, or when and how to act."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Independence and individualis m are not merely catchphrases to him. He is suspicious when such terms are used to enslave rather than to liberate, when they proffer false security instead of true grounded integral sovereignty. Essentially, the Uranian “Fool” is a proverbial fifth column ist or agent provocateur working to bring down the “dark satanic mills” that incarcerate the spirit of man. He is a true servant of the Holy Spirit, even if he does not look like one. The Spirit of Rebellion and the return to Selfhood will be humankind‟s s alvation in the dark times that are approaching. W e have already been feeling, seeing, and experiencing the subtle and not so subtle effects of Uranus and Pluto for some time now. The “Hippy” era of the 1960s was a perfect expression of the lower and more chaotic Aquarian - Uranian archetypes. The “Punk” era of the 1970s was a good example of lower frequency Scorpionic - Plutonic archetypes, and the sexual promiscuity of the „80s and „90s was also a patently lower - octave symptom. W e are still, however, to exper ience the higher, purer manifestation of these archetypes although we will not have long to wait. Let it be understood, however, that the power - brokers of the world order will not just sit by and allow the Spirit of Rebellion work its magic. As in the day s of old they have many a counter - plan devised to maintain their hegemony. The rise of evangelism, oppressive laws, and conservative governments are evidence of this reaction to the liberating energies of Pluto and Uranus. The nature of Pluto is similar to that of the Hindu god Shiva...Pluto usually begins by breaking down a structure, then creates a new one in its place. The entire cycle of death, destruction and renovation is accompanied by tremendous powers, for Pluto is not a mild or even very subtle plan etary influence. It brings decay at one level or another...It also rules the death and regeneration of the self, as old aspects of your life pass away...Pluto does not represent death in the literal sense, instead it refers to a metaphorical death, something t hat ceases to be - Robert Hand ( Planets in Transit ) In the intermediate years we will do well to educate ourselves as to how the architects of ruin, within the religious and political hierarchies, are likely to react to this influx of liberating energy. Th ese well - established bastions of repression and oppression are, after all, not in the habit of just rolling out of the way and giving up the ghost. W e can expect them to willfully react in concert to overcome the new paradigm and new modality of expression that seeks to breach their walls and invade their territory, so to speak. As we can see from an astromantic study of the 1960s and „70s, the Saturnian forces of law, order, and oppression, do not hesitate to retaliate and quell the Spirit of Rebellion . Th e agents of Saturnian, Solar, and Martian energy (the governments, educational edifices, and official religions, etc) do know, however, that there are many long - term benefits to be gained from permitting short - term “angst -"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"release” from the “Under - Classes” they manipulate and control. This is why there have been, in the past, certain high - profile bouts of rebellion and fleeting chaotic flickers of anarchy from the disenchanted and malcontented within society. As ex - rebels James Simon Kunen (Columbia Universi ty activist) and Jerry Kirk (Black Panthers) have already informed us, there are two main forms of rebellion - the soft and the hard. There is the “designer” or “chic” version that serves, in the long run, to reinforce the established status quo, and there is the authentic and radical form that attempts, and occasionally succeeds, in countering and demolishing the rotten status quo. The masses of discontented and inwardly discomfited who consider themselves as being “against the system” (and this includes t he majority of pseudo - Communists, pseudo - Anarchists, and so on) are usually of the first variety and are, therefore, easily duped and led. More often than not these soft - rebels are also highly duplicitous, narcissistic and devious. They desire only to seiz e the reigns of power for themselves. After all, how many Stalins, Castros, Maos, and Mugabes of the world begin as zealous “opponents” of the status quo only to later become the most zealous of oppressors? As W illiam Blake wrote: \"...the fist that crushes the tyrants head becomes a tyrant in the tyrant‟s stead.\" So, although the masters of the game may occasionally permit this soft designer - rebelliousness, they are ever vigilant against the true hard form should it ever threaten to appear. They are dangero us because there are so many of them. It is one thing to have a few nuts or dissidents. They can be dealt with, justly or otherwise, so that they do not pose a danger to the system. It is quite another situation when you have a true movement - millions of citizens believing something, particularly when the movement is made up of society‘s average, successful citizens - William Colby (Late Director of CIA) Where a majority are united by a common sentiment, and have an opportunity, the rights of the minor par ty become insecure. In a republican government the majority, if united, have always an opportunity. The only remedy is to enlarge the sphere\" (that is, unite all the States under a federal government) \"and thereby divide the community into so great a numbe r of interests and parties that, in the first place, a majority will not be likely, at the same moment, to have a common interest separate from that of the whole, or of the minority; and, in the second place, that, in case they should have such an interest , they may not be so apt to unite in the pursuit of it - President James Madison ( Elliot's Debates, Vol. 5) That spirit of constructive resistance and rebellion was present in Mikhail Bakunin, W illiam Blake, W illiam W allace, and Che Guevara, and in the mod ern comedians Bill Hicks and Lenny Bruce. It was found in Giordano Bruno and Soren Kierkegaard, in Ezra Pound, Ayn Rand, W ilhelm Reich and Jiddu Krishnamurti. It is the holy daemon about to possess many people in the world, many of whom would not at this m oment consider themselves rebels with any cause. There are many sleeping heretics in the world and they are soon to be awakened. However, there are certain rules that come with the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"package and certain laws that the rational rebel must acknowledge and maste r. Authentic rebels know, for instance, that it is pointless and hypocritical to strive against external tyranny unless one has first combated their own inner repressive instincts and drives. The true rebel is not merely a rager against the machine or a ca mpus malcontent. He is a student of oppression, repression, and slavery. He allows the forces he despises and opposes to be his best tutors and he observes these forces closely, in order to become minutely aware of their nature and behavior. He extrapolate s and examines the anatomy of tyranny and comes to know cruelty, sadism, violence, injustice, and destruction intimately . The rebels who are going to matter, and who will possess the rational power to effect proactive change, are those who become “walking encyclopedias” of evil. There is not a nuance of it that eludes them. Having walked through Hades, to emerge again, the Servant of Truth is supremely qualified to heal and revive the lost and ignorant people of the world.

T ruth and Oblivion The creed which a fanatical sect produced...has shown a great power over the minds of men throughout these twenty - five centuries...Why it was born at that particular moment, or ever, is something that no one can explain - Douglas Reed ( Co ntroversy of Zion ) A short time ago, historically speaking, a worldwide cataclysm precipitated the fall of advanced pre - diluvian civilizations. Supposedly, mighty continents sank beneath towering waves, were swallowed by the gaping earth, or were simply ob literated from the face of existing landmasses by ferocious natural forces. By colossal error and folly, the scattered remnants of these pre - diluvian civilizations have since been taken for the nascent ones of the so - called \"historical\" period that ostensi bly commenced approximately 8,000 years ago, during the early Neolithic epoch. Although the earliest of the world's Mesolithic and Megalithic sites have proven to be more sophisticated in design and construction than those of later date, most people contin ue to accept the unsustainable fiction concerning the world of the past. Ancient man was primitive and modern man is civilized. This is what most people accept and believe. It is, however, one of the most egregious fallacies conceivable. ...in mind you are all young; there is no old opinion handed down among you by ancient tradition, nor any science which is hoary with age - (words of an Egyptian priest to Solon, the father of Plato) A second cataclysmic wave, so to speak, has likewise swept from the Earth the august Druidic colleges that operated throughout the world restoring, for the good of all, the elements of technology from a devastated bygone age - the age of the gods . These colleges and their creators are equally lost, equally buried, and equally fo rgotten. In the place of these sanctums of knowledge and culture there eventually arose institutions and teachings that sought not to improve and enlighten but to confuse and mislead. They were the creations of virtueless men. These men eventually erected empires upon sites where the Druid Elders - the Servants of Truth - had once given instruction concerning the workings of mind and soul, world and cosmos. It might be said that history is the story of the conflict between the Servants of Truth and the virt ueless ones, between magicians and sorcerers. The obliteration of the gnosis of the primordial caste of Elders was a man - made holocaust largely unknown to us today. It is this calamity that has damaged and oppressed the peoples of the world more than any s eries of natural disasters, terrible as they might have"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"been. To these Elders of old, a twisted and darkened mind was a horror worse to behold than a broken, lightless world. The state of learning on the continent of Europe at that time, wherever the influ ence of the Roman Church was dominant, was at a very low state or non - existent. It was only in the monastic establishments maintained at different points on the continent by the monks of the Irish Church that learned men were to be found. There were practi cally no learned men in the Roman Church at that time. Even a century later when the Emperor Charlemagne espoused the cause of the Roman Church, he had to get Irish schoolmen for instructors to teach in the palace school which he established - Conor MacDar i ( The Bible: An Irish Book ) Regardless of the effort and zeal, we can hardly prove to everyone's satisfaction that Judeo - Christianity has its roots in Irish Druidism, and in what came before. W e cannot prove that Christianity's founders decided to destroy all trace of their new religion's esoteric Irish origins, even if this should be our strongest held belief. Too little is known of these austere founders of official Christianity, these ruthless autocrats who galvanized their crumbling empires and waning control through the instigation of a corrupt solar theology. The Roman E mperor Constantine, the founder of Christianity who intolerantly sent hundreds to their deaths as heretics and non - believers, was himself not baptized until after his death. Yes, the Machiavellian architects of Judeo - Christianity perished ages ago and so w e are unable to prove whether they were truly god - inspired or not. W e can merely examine and scrutinize their actions, and those of the men who succeeded them and acted in their name. It is from such rational scrutiny that we can base our judgments. W e ca n heed the advice of the Christ, as recorded in the Book of Matthew , while noting the passage's Druidic imagery: Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

In a world order created, managed, and governe d by the mentally and emotionally deranged, truth, and men of truth, cannot thrive. They can barely survive. Should such Servants of Truth endeavor to guide civilizations, educate their fellows, and erect honest colleges and churches, they will be hindered and undermined by their arch - rivals. This urge to obstruct and deny the Truth is the distinguishing mindset and drive of all those who secretly consider their own existence threatened by reason and truth, and of men within whom virtue has not found a home . W hat we cannot so easily conceive of is the ecstatic glee felt by the unsane after their successful annihilation of their despised rivals, the Servants of Truth. In their ending, in their humiliation and loss, in the misrepresentation of their message, a nd in the distortion of their sublime gnosis, lies the sanctimonious hubris and elevation to power of the depraved. The Gods have proclaimed Christ to have been most pious, but the Christians are a confused and vicious sect - Porphyry (Neoplatonic philosop her, 3rd century BC) The Church burned enormous amounts of literature. In 391 Christians burned down one of the world's greatest libraries in Alexandria, said to have housed 700,000 rolls. All the books of the Gnostic Basilides, Porphyry's 36 volumes, papy rus rolls of 27 schools of the Mysteries, and 270,000 ancient documents gathered by Ptolemy Philadelphus were burned. Ancient academies of learning were closed. Education for anyone outside of the Church came to an end - Helen Ellerbe ( The Dark Side of Chr istian History ) Every science was regarded as an outcast, an enemy. Every fact held the creed of the church in scorn. Investigators were enemies in disguise. Thinkers were traitors, and the church exerted its vast power for centuries to prevent the intelle ctual progress of man. There was no liberty, no education, no philosophy, no science; nothing but credulity, ignorance, and superstition. The world was really under the control of Satan and his agents. The church, for the purpose of increasing her power, e xhausted every means to convince the people of the existence of witches, devils, and fiends. In this way the church had every enemy within her power. She simply had to charge him with being a wizard, of holding communication with devils, and the ignorant m ob was ready to tear him to pieces - Robert Green Ingersoll ( The Great Infidels, 1881) The mad men of the past are no more, but their legacy of chaos and lies remain.

When we contemplate the mysteries of time and history, we see how everything that exists came into being for a reason. It is only intellectual lethargy, and the passage of time, that allows fallacies to appear before us in the guise of fac ts. Indeed, all that is required for a historical lie to be accepted as historical truth is the passage of historical time. This particular phenomenon has been, and continues to be, on the minds of the world's most devious mythmongers who seek to further t he deceptive industry of their predecessors. Those who have arranged the subject of history, so that men see what they are meant to see and so they know only that which they are meant to know, are profoundly aware of how the simple passage of time aids the m in their heinous work. As the arch - perjurer of the fifteenth century, Geraldus Cambrensis, haughtily wrote: People of today laugh at these things because they know the facts, but people of future generations will not know and therefore they will accept t hem as true history - ( The Conquest of Ireland ) Author Tony Bushby, musing on the origins of Christianity, wrote in his fine book The Bible Fraud , the following most appropriate passage: The scriptural and historical data...shows that the New Testament was never an authentic record, but was, in its entirety, a corpus of corrupted documents specifically constructed to induce a particular belief Given that Bushby's denotation includes the Old Testament, we believe we can offer the reader a clear explanation as to what this \"particular belief\" is. In our work, we have gone a long way to uncover the reason for the composition of the Old and New Testaments and we have gained for ourselves, if for no one else, a solid understanding concerning the identity of its authors and their true purpose and agenda.

The Pagan Origins of the Bible That the New Testament analysis as we know it only began in the nineteenth century reflects the almost superstitious reluctance to examine the original texts that came out of the Church‘s age - long prohibition on B ible reading for the masses. For centuries only priests read the Scriptures - in fact, in most cases they had the monopoly of literacy - Picket and Prince ( Templar Revelation ) The religions of Christianity and Judaism originate from the same source, and th at source is Egypt. Egyptian culture and religion had its source also, and that source is Ireland . Ireland's Druidic and proto - Druidic traditions, likewise, had their source in the pre - diluvian civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria. These facts will come a s something of a shock to the majority of those readers who have received their education from conventional sources and who have tended to blithely accept on faith all that pours forth from the mouths and pens of the so - called \"historians\" and \"experts\" wh o believe themselves informed about the world of the past. The Christian church is an encyclopedia of prehistoric cults - Fredrick Nietzsche Everything supernatural the presbyters wrote about their developing god could be traced to earlier religious belief s - Tony Bushby ( Bible Fraud ) Thankfully, the insinuation that Christianity has little to do with the land and traditions of Egypt is being refuted by many perspicacious researchers. As the Jewish scriptures recorded, and as the accounts of the early life of Jesus admit, Egypt did play a part in the birth of Judeo - Christianity. The \"magi\" came to visit the new born sun king from Egypt and, according to the scriptures, the young Jesus and his family allegedly took refuge there. W hat is more, Christianity beg an in Egypt. The Egyptians were the first and largest contingent of converts to the religion they most likely regarded as just another one of the many solar churches in Alexandria, Heliopolis, and elsewhere. Christianity was first preached in Egypt by the Evangelist Mark about thirty years after the Crucifixion.

As Karl Luckert points out, modern commentators, while acknowledging that this concept of Jesus‘s continued spiritual presence is not Jewish, do not provide any ideas as to its true context and background. So where did this ide a come from? Luckert‘s erudite analysis shows conclusively that the twin concepts of Jesus‘ unique Resurrection and his continued presence can be traced without a shadow of doubt to Egyptian theology - John M. Robinson ( Pagan Christs ) When quiet was re - est ablished in Egypt by the Roman armies, after more than sixty years of civil troubles, it was found to be no longer the same country that it had been...It was during these years of civil trouble and political agitation that Christianity, or at least a form of religion which called itself Christian, spread over the whole of Egypt. That large class of the population which a few years before formed the priesthood of the old temples, were now Christian monks - Samuel Sharpe ( Egyptian Mythology and Egyptian Chris tianity ) Since the building of Constantinople, and the removal of the seat of government to that city, no political quarrel separated Rome from Egypt. Pagan Rome, ever since the union of the two countries under Augustus, except when interrupted by the rebe llions, had been eagerly copying the superstitions of Egypt, and Christian Rome still followed the same course - ibid Fortunately the bible, like any book, will reveal its secrets, but only to those skeptical and persistent enough to follow the twists and turns in its convoluted text in order to ascertain what is true and what is false. Academics concede that the bible's text is full of \"pious fraud.\" They admit that there are two gods being spoken of in the opening books and that as time went by these two gods (Elohim and Jehovah) became fused into one, known henceforth as the \"Lord God.\" They concede that there are errors, fictions, and skewed facts and that there are stories concerning people who never lived. They freely admit that there are plagiarisms a nd renditions of pagan myths and legends, and that the very gospels were not written by those four \"saints\" after whom they are named. Yes, a lot of things have been conceded since bible study began in earnest a mere 100 years ago. And a lot has had to be conceded given the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Gnostic Gospels, texts from within Christianity that contradict some of the most revered but The Druids - The oldest priestarchy on earth, from the oldest civilization on earth.

Since the Scrolls were found some six decades ago, close associates of the Vatican were placed in dominant positions in every phase of the investigation and translations of the Scrolls. The priests regulated the flow of information a nd controlled its release - Tony Bushby ( The Bible Fraud ) Despite these relatively important concessions we are still in need of revelations concerning the actual origins of it all. Scholars have be en correct to sense that the source of Judeo - Christianity lies in the Egypt of over 32 pharaonic dynasties with traditions stretching back to the remotest periods. Yet these same minds cannot accept that the theology and traditions of predynastic Egypt cou ld have been transplanted there from elsewhere. Sadly, the connections between Egypt and the more ancient land of Ireland have barely been broached. Those few revisionists who offered proofs of the connection are all but forgotten. The monuments prove that , quite early in the Dynastic Period, there was known and worshipped in Lower Egypt another form of the Sun - god who was called RA. Of his origin and early history nothing is known, and the meaning of his name has not yet been satisfactorily explained. It d oes not seem to be Egyptian - E. A. Wallis Budge ( Tutankhamen: Amenism, Atenism and Egyptian Monotheism, 1923) The centre of the cult of Ra in Egypt was Anu, or Heliopolis, and the city must have been inhabited by a cosmopolitan population (who were chiefl y worshippers of the sun) from time immemorial. All the caravans from Arabia and Syria halted there, whether outward or homeward bound, and men of many nations and tongues must have exchanged ideas there as well as commodities - ibid As we have said, obliv ion has been the fated destination of any skeptical scholar, historian, or writer with the effrontery to go against convention and question the barrage of spurious conjecture that would have the world accept the uniqueness of Jesus, the divinity of the Chu rch, the veracity of the gospels, or beloved notions concerning the exodus, diaspora, and the East to West dispersion of cultural elements.

Yet skepticism is a correct attitude to adopt when we are asked to believe that the elements of civilization migrated from East to West, or that a small and insignificant group of vagabond exiles from one of the oldest and greatest civilizatio ns on earth were chosen by god to be the spiritual fathers of the world. And skepticism is certainly appropriate when we are told by its representatives that we must either conform to the tenets and dogmas of the Judeo - Christian religion or suffer eternal damnation.

W e might exchange it for a true understanding of mankind's past and might choose knowledge as our salvation instead of the jaded cynicism so pervasive in today's world.

Men have been trained to prefer ignorance to learning, and have chosen to be driven mad and wild by faith, rather than to be instructed, enlightened and improved by reason and philosophy - Rev. Robert Taylor ( Devil's Pulpit, 1830 AD) If and when we consid er the events that have transpired under the auspices of this religion, or the crimes that have been committed in the name of its god (the genocide, subjugation, sadistic inquisitions, repression of natural instincts, suppression of women, sequestering of knowledge, reticence to disclose origins, negation and despiritualization of nature, and so on), we might find within us a very strong drive to uncover the truth that has eluded so many.

The Hierarchy of Aton At the close of t he ̳Great Hymn to the Aten‘ it says, ―There is no one who knows you, except your son, Akhenaton‖ - Lorraine Evans ( Kingdom of the Ark ) The bible is a compilation of numerous occidental and oriental pagan doctrines. Its compilation was commissioned by the c hiefs of the Solar Cult (Atonists) situated in Tanis, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Rome, in order to galvanize their empire and maintain control over the minds of the mass of illiterate and superstition - ridden human beings under their dominion. Dominion over men and the world was what it was all about, and little has changed when it comes to this agenda. Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. For it is commen dable if a man bears up under pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God...But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God - (Peter 2:18 - 21) Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven - (Colossians 4:1) One of the pernicious ideologies promoted and broadcast by the church, and by the bible, concerns the phenomenon of hierarchy. Hierarchy replaced holarchy as an metaphysical paradigm and world view after the advent of orthodox Christianity. Along with its erroneous concepts regarding selfhood , it was this modification of metaphysics that separated Christianity from its Druidic origins. In the Christian universe a man is assigned his role and pla ce from the outset. He is a sinner and worthy of death. Above him reigns an imperious god and his chosen ministers. Below his level dwells Satan and the fires of hell. If a man should wish to ascend toward godhead, he must follow the guidelines set down by his masters. He must conform and believe what he is told by those who know what is best for his soul. He must combat the sin of self - will and obey without question all he is told. After all, his instruction comes directly from god who speaks only through his most trusted ministers. In this way a man is kept in his place, within his designated station. His rebellious drives are placated by endless future promises forever unfulfilled. The most fantastic and yet psychically tranquilizing of these promises con cerns a man's fate in the afterlife.

Yes, one cannot think of a more successful stratagem than the promise. I will reveal to you the hidden Treasures, the Riches kept in sec ret, that you may know that I am the Lord - (Isaiah 45:3) In private, to his disciples, he revealed everything - (Mark 4:34) Sadly and astonishingly, prominent and inquiring men have also seen fit to submit their reason to this promise of \"secret\" knowledg e transmitted privately. Indeed, there is no secret society of importance operating anywhere in the world that does not employ this very ruse to ensure loyalty and obedience from its selected members and initiates. It is obviously a major turn - on for certa in people to consider themselves privy to an arcane tradition lauded from the heights by so august and powerful a quorum. As the feudal barons garnered assistance in times of war from their knights and serfs by promises of land and loot, so have the religi ous quorum seduced men by the lure of sequestered wisdom. Promises of this kind have, however, served a greater purpose than to merely ensure conformity and obedience. The promise of secret knowledge plays to the vanity of men, the very vanity that Ecclesi astes so adamantly warns mankind against. The promise becomes a lure and source of obsession. Under the spell of the promise men will eagerly construct and endorse the obscene hierarchy. They will do so because they secretly desire rank within that hierarc hy. The vast majority of men seek to lord it over those below them. And once this seniority is bestowed, protected, and ensured, the vanity of \"little men\" is swiftly satiated. One may not be pharaoh over the whole game, but being made the lord over one sm all square on the board, so to speak, provides quite enough ego satisfaction for the power - gorged man in this world.

This kind of egregious anti - human manipulation, and deliberate liberty taken with man's natural curiosity and passion for truth and meaning, is among the most heinous of the many crimes that can be laid before the doors of religion, the Judeo - Christian door in particular.

However this is, in our opinion, not a constructive or r ational decision since there is only partial wisdom to be had in finding out how one has been duped. True wisdom comes when we discover the underlying reasons for any deception and when we find out what it was within us that needed to believe such fictions . Moreover, there is a duty to prevent the entrapment of other human beings, particularly those coming into the world after us, who are sure to be likewise duped and waylaid if they are not forewarned.

Many historians have been puzzled as to why W estern \"European\" man has had such an obsessive fascination with the convoluted nonsense of the bible. Why was this tome taken to heart by W esterners who had their own rich ancestral traditions? Certainly, force was involved, but the main reason for its acceptance is a carefully guarded secret. The bible stories were accepted throughout the occident because they were born there. Travesties they may be, but the ancestral brain remembers and is subconsciously familiar with the underlying truths contained in the bible's lamentably fragmented and convoluted texts. Behind the apparent nonsense and contradictions, the protestations and dubious morality tales, lies the great tale - that of the stars, the heavens, and the wisdom therein.

W e submit, however, that it is foolhardy to believe that the bible's utter incoherence and fantastic collection of scientific, philosophical, and theological errors, is proof of innocence on behalf of its composers and compil ers. The various biblical councils could certainly have fashioned for themselves and their flock a book of sublime rationality such as would have impressed the Grecian philosophers. But this was not their aim and the inconsistencies and absurdities were pu rposely left in for a very important reason. A rational book, understood by all, would need no interpreters whereas a mythical compendium would require it. The clerics, bishops, cardinals, priests, and curates of the past, and the hysterical, verbose, and ludicrous evangelists and pastors who preach today, would hardly be required if the chapters, verses, and words of the bible made sense . They were not intended to make rational sense. They were chosen, entered, and espoused because they stimulate the mythi c sensibility and ancestral consciousness. They stir the imagination and limbic centers of the brain, and mollify the needs and cravings of the many rather than sharpen the logic of the independent thinker. The world's masses require myths, and subconsciou sly rely upon them in order to feel secure. Believing these myths allows a man to feel part, rather than apart , of the collective. Men require things to believe in, and to have faith in. They are largely unaware of how these needs make them victims of mani pulation. W here belief is operating, sanity and reason are often in abeyance, and the masters of the game, the \"Scribes and Pharisees\" so to speak, know this only too well. The early potentates never expected an independent and critical class to rise duri ng their own time, or at any other time. They were concerned with duping the mass, the rank and file, and those illiterate hordes who could not work out the bible's meaning for themselves and who would not be permitted to do so. Humanity inherited the Cult of the Priest and has been under the power of these blackguards for thousands of years. For their special self - appointed duty of pontificating upon the \"mysteries\" of the bible they live in luxury and are awarded all sorts of titles and social privileges. Indeed, it is this special overclass that molds and controls the societies of the world.

Our understanding of the bible is made a great deal easier when we finally realize that what it contains is not history . The tales and legends in the bible that have been put before the public as a people's history is anything but a history in the true sense of the word. This does not invalidate the content, it merely puts it in the correct context so that greater sense may be gleaned fr om it. Throughout the ancient tales there are many repetitive motifs. One of the most repetitive refrains concerns the building of a new world over the ashes of the old. In the various accounts we find evidence of guilt and, of course, fear of the Lord. Th ere is also a fear of the world . There is a certain terror of extinction coupled with a fervent desire to build a better world than that which existed in the past when men disobeyed god and endured enormous suffering as a result. And so, in the various mor ality tales of the Old and New Testaments, we receive an emphasis on obedience and right living, and on the consequences for disobedience and sinfulness. The stories that came down embodying such warnings were embellished over and over again to further hig hlight the theme of virtue.

In the psyche of men, light has become the prime metaphor for knowledge and understanding as well as the symbol for sacrifice, renewal, and perfection. Man awakes from the darkness of sleep in the morning at the first beams of light and he likewise arises (\"Aries\") to higher knowledge by way of the light. Men of knowledge were men of light. Their emblem was the sun. Their fellows were a brotherhood of light, and enlightenment was what they b rought forth after their own awakenings. Light dispels the darkness synonymous with ignorance and debauch. And so light, like a weapon of sorts, is something to be respected and used aright. Its users and wielders, the Apollonian begetters and bestowers of light, were known in occult circles as \"Lucifers.\" They were the sons of the golden morning or dawning, the sons of the sun - the Princes of Light . The earliest brotherhoods of the sun were to be found in Ireland and Egypt.

Jesus Christ - The Star There was no Jesus of Nazareth - Albert Schweitzer ( The Quest for the Historical Jesus , 1906) When Christianity preach ed Jesus as God, it preached the most familiar name of its own deity to Druidism; and in the ancient British tongue 'Jesus' has never assumed its Greek, Latin, or Hebrew form, but remains the pure Druidic 'Yesu' - Fredrick Haberman ( Tracing Our Ancestors ) The term \"Christian\" appears only three times in the New Testament's convoluted scriptures. It appears twice in Acts and once in I Peter, although the entries in Acts may not be original. They may have been added by editors at a later date. W orse than this , the word \"Christian\" can not be found in Christian literature composed in the first one hundred years after the supposed crucifixion of Jesus. The term is found only in literature of pagan authorship. On almost every occasion the term is used to describe degenerate sects who have disturbed society by violent and illegal acts. The first pagan author to mention the term was Suetonius. After him it appeared in a letter of an Adrian around the year 117 AD. Spelled \"Chrestian\" it again turned up in the work of Justin Martyr between 147 and 161 AD. As we can see these brief entries do not provide enough information to verify that the term signified the followers of the biblical Jesus. The term Krist (or Karast ) was a title commonly bestowed by the Essenes to den ote one of their excellent or special initiates who had passed through extraordinary trials and who held high status and rank. It was not a personal name. The Essenes are known to have referred to themselves as \"the Elect\" or as \"Sons of Light.\" Masters of high caliber were known as the \"Star.\" This is clearly an astrological title. Paintings have been discovered of priests with star - shaped diadems upon their foreheads. The very word minister contains the syllables for moon ( min ) and star ( ster ).

Interes tingly, this word simply meant \"those who choose.\" I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright morning star - (Rev 22:16) A star shall come forth out of Jacob, and a scepter shall arose out of Israel - (Numbers 24:17) ...the Egyptian Karast (Krst) is the original Christ, and that the Egyptian mysteries were continued by the Gnostics and Christianized in Rome - Gerald Massey ( Ancient Egypt: Light of the World , 1907) ...the Egyptian karast was the pre - Christian Christ, and the pictures in the Roman Cat acombs preserve the proof.

Newspapers and businesses utilize the title, and media celebrities have even been given th e term to emphasize their iconic status and claim to fame. When found in a text, the star determined (or indicated to the reader) that the group of hieroglyphs associated with it was related to spiritual matters. It was related to the heavens, to invisible energies (which the Greeks called ―aetheric‖) - David Ovason ( Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capitol ) Evidently, the star that was of concern to the Essenes and to the descendants of the Cult of Aton, was the sun itself and not just any old star in t he over - crowded heavens. The Commander, the David, the Krist, the Lucifer, or Messiah, was not only the \"Star,\" he was the Sun - the Prince of Light. The personality of Jesus Christ, as known to modern Christians, is based on several Messianic rebel figure s of the ―Holy Land,‖ but particularly on Simon Magus, Judas the Galilean, and Yeshua Ben Panthera, none of whom had anything to do with literally being from God.

It was used by the ancient Irish priesthood of Iesa, precisely as Latin is today used in the Roman Church to impress the multitude - Conor Mac Dari In the Egyptian language the word “Christ” denoted one who was \"anointed.\" In ancient times there was a process or ritual known as Horasis . During this rite the male's entire body was regarded as a phallus and anointed accordingly. This practice originat ed from the Druids who would anoint the trunk of a specially prepared oak tree with oil. W e note a similar practice among the Egyptians, whose ithyphallic obelisk symbolized the ancient earth god Geb. And we find the practice among the Hindus, whose erect \"lingam\" stone symbolized the ancient god Shiva, or Pashupati. The very word Messiah comes from the Hebrew Mashiach (Egyptians Messeh ) which means \"anointed.\" It specifically referred to the oil that was processed from the fat of the Nile crocodiles that w ere sacred to the Egyptian god Sobek. The most ancient dated Christian inscription (Oct. 1, 318 A.D.) runs \"The Lord and Saviour Jesus the Good\" - Chrestos, not Christos.

They were embodiments of the Earth and Sk y goddesses. The reverence for and incorporation of the goddess principle, and of nature religion, was Druidic in origin. These principles and observances were eventually expunged from Christian theology that is patristic and androcentric in complexion. Av ersion to the spiritual authority of the female, and antipathy toward the feminine principle, was the reason why the Christian Fathers made sure to denigrate Mary Magdalene, the priestess who anointed Jesus with costly spikenard, and whom some researchers believe to have been his consort. The important matter, however, is not that she was a physical wife to the man Jesus but that she was a symbolic representation of the Christed man‟s feminine aspect. The biblical Mary is an analog to Danu, Brigit, Isis, Nu ith, and Ma'at, to Demeter, Hera, Persephone, and Eve. Like the moon in the heavens and the night sky around the Earth, the feminine Anima both mirrors and embraces the masculine Animus. It is said of Mary and the women around Jesus that they \"ministered u nto him of their substance\" - Picket and Prince ( The Templar Revelation ) If the rite of sacrament of chrism was superior to that of baptism, then this implies that Mary's authority was actually greater than John the Baptist's - ibid Anointing was an ancien t custom throughout the East, by pouring aromatic oils on persons as a token of honor...it was also employed in consecrating priests, prophets,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"and kings, and the places and instruments appointed for worship - ( New American Cyclopedia ) In ancient Palestine t radition it would seem kings, political and military chiefs, village heads and, in fact, any claimants to high office, were anointed and hence called the ―anointed ones‖...some...after anointing, then became called ―lord...‖ - Tony Bushby Jewish author and histo rian Hyam Maccoby states that the term Messiah referred to the seed and house of David. It is believed that the name Moses may also be related to the term messeh, to the crocodile - god Sobek and the house of the pharaoh. After all, as the story goes, Moses was found on the river, the domain of the crocodile god Sobek. In the Osirian tradition of Egypt, he who arose from the waters of the Nile had, so to speak, been born again into illumination and mastery. He was, at that point, a high priest capable of init iating others into the mysteries he himself had mastered. The mythic trope was preserved in priestly ritual. It is not that Moses was physically found on the waters by a princess. Osiris was rescued from death by Isis and Moses was, likewise, rescued by th e pharaoh‟s daughter.

It was a title given to the highest initiate of the Solar Cult in Egypt, although its actual origins lie in Ireland. A \"Jesus Christ \" was a high ranking priest of the temples of the sun. He was a priest of Aton, the sun god worshipped at cities of Heliopolis, Avaris, Tanis, Amarna, and Alexandria. The title was transferable and did not specify a single unique god - inspired savior.

On i ts journey, the sun encounters other luminaries and stars and must pass through constellations and houses. This personification of heavenly bodies began in Ireland with the Druids. It was a subject taught throughout the world by masters in the many Druidic colleges that were destroyed by the Romans and founders of Christianity. To the Druids there was nothing secretive about the sun king and his message of light and love. The son of god - the metaphorical \"Light of the W orld\" - is the sun of god, the actual light of the world . This is not as heretical as it may first sound for when we do our homework and open our eyes we will discover t hat the elites within Judeo - Christianity know this fact all too well.

Jackson ( Pagan Origins of the Jesus Myth ) There is no doubt that we have before us in the Vedic Agni Cult the original source of all the stories of the birth of the Fire - Gods and Sun - Gods. These gods usually enter life in d arkness and confinement. Thus the Cretan Zeus was born in a cavern, Mithras, Dionysus and Hermes in a gloomy grotto, Horus in the ―stable‖ of the holy cow - Jesus too was born at dead of night in a lowly ―stable‖ at Bethlehem - Arthur Dewes ( The Christ Myt h ) The Church abandoned the idea of the birthday of Jesus coinciding with the day of the heliacal rising of Sirius in 7 BC for a symbolic rebirth of the sun in winter. The July birthday would have shown all too clearly the connection between Christianity a nd the original Osiris religion of Egypt.

Gilbert ( Magi: The Search for a Secret Tradition ) But there was a diversity of opinion amongst the Christia n Fathers as to whether Jesus the Christ was born in the winter solstice or in the vernal equinox. It was held by some that the 25 of March was the natal day. Others maintained that this was the day of the incarnation. According to Clement of Alexandria th e birth of Jesus took place upon the 25 of March. But in Rome the festival of Lady Day was celebrated on the 25 of March in commemoration of the miraculous conception in the womb of the virgin, which virgin gives birth to the child at Christmas, nine month s afterward. According to the gospel of James (Ch. 18) it was in the equinox, and consequently not at Christmas, that the virgin birth took place...when it was officially set by decree of Pope Julius in the year 345 A.D., it was placed on December 25 expre ssly to match the astronomical date of the birth of Mithra and Dionysus in the Mystery cults!

It was these pagan mystery traditions that advocated sun - gods, dying saviors, and divine salvation, and not Judaism . These facts have been guilefully obscured by latter - day elites within the Roman Catholic (and Protestant) churches who have a great deal to lose should the pagan roots of their \"heavenly\" Jesus be revealed.

Desmond Stewart suggests that the word was, in fact, H elios - the name of the sun god - Picket and Prince ( Templar Revelation ) Bearing these statements in mind we can see why the search within Judaism for the roots of Christianity has been so relatively unproductive. The various remarkable idioms of the Chris tian religion are kindred to the great mystery religions of which the modern man sadly remembers little. The power executives behind religion and government do not want the ordinary person to know about the myriad crucified saviors of antiquity or of the m yriad other virgin births and wounded and dying martyr - heroes who performed miracles and came for a season only to depart in some kind of fantastic and dramatic manner. No, we are not instructed in the history of the world's antique theologies and interest in paganism is generally taboo for \"good Christians.\" But gods and saviors, like ordinary men and women, have dates of birth and a lineage.

Jackson ( Pagan Origins of the Jesus Myth ) Marcion was the most active and influential Christian teacher in the first half of the second century AD...We do not find in Marcion's gospel any reference to Jesus having lived, suffered and died at the time of Pontius Pilate - Ahmed Osman ( Christianity: An Egyptian Religion ) ...the Jes us of the Fourth Gospel and the Jesus of the synoptics - Matt, Mark, and Luke - are very different Jesuses - R. Joseph Hoffmann ( Jesus in History and Myth ) Moreover, a great deal of trouble has been caused within theological circles, as well as in the secu lar domain, simply due to confusion over the difference between the physical Jesus (a supposed historical personality) and the preternatural Christ figure. In most minds the two are fused as one and this presumptuous blending, together with the plethora of other factual inconsistencies between the two entities, has lead the Christian and non - Christian masses to see one where the other should be, and to think of one in terms of the other."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The attributes of the spiritual Christ have been transferred and trans posed to the physical personality while the attributes of the supposed physical Jesus have been carried over to the phantasmagoria of the Christ. W e have been conditioned to treat these two very different entities as one and the same. Nevertheless, they ar e not the same. In short, the story of the man Jesus is quite a different story than that of the Christ. This fact cannot be overstressed. The schism between orthodox Jews and Gentile Christians is a symptom of this blurring. Rabbinical tradition accepts t he physical Jesus and his role as Messiah but not a supernatural Christ. The Pauline version of Christianity as encapsulated in the New Testament augments the spiritually perfected God - Man sent from heaven to save souls. The various Jewish sects generally accept a Messianic figure; a teacher, or specially endowed rabbi who will arrive to correctly explain the torah and guide them. This teacher or rabbi is sent by god but he is not a divine or supernatural entity in the same way as the Pauline Christ. The many sects (Nazarene Church, Jerusalem Church, Essenes, Ebionites, Zealots, Sadducees, Pharisees, etc, etc,) did not agree among themselves about the identity of their icon, nor did they have consensus over the historical timing of his supposed existence. The Vatican has augmented and benefited from these discrepancies and has conspired to prevent many seminal Jewish texts and scriptures (like the Dead Sea Scrolls, Nag Hammadi Library, Gospel of Thomas, etc,) from being translated, published, and made publicly available, in case they proffer forth information that compromises the official dogmas of the Vatican. ...the Jesus of history is a living fi gure, who lived, who moved through life, who died...the Jesus of theology is god...and there isn't really a lot of connection between these two figures.

Suffice it to say that neither character was historical in the ancient systems - Alvin Boyd Kuhn ( Great Myth of the Sun Gods ) In 1415, the Church of Rome took an extraordinary step to destroy all knowledge of two Second Century Jewish books that it said contained ̳the true name of Jesus Christ.‘ The Antipope Benedict XIII first singled out for condemnation a secret Latin treatise called ̳Mar Yesu‘ a nd then issued instructions to destroy all copies of the Book of Elxai.

British - Israelites, such as Fredrick Haberman and E. Raymond Capt, have assured the world that Jesus and his coterie arrived in England with the Roman trader Joseph of Arimathea in the years following the supposed crucifixion. Those who have deciphered Templar and Gnostic documents believe that Jesus survived his crucifixion and that he and his wife Mary Magdalene traveled to England by way of France.

W e are quite bemused with the efforts of writers such as these to prove the ex istence of the world's most elusive man. Perhaps, such authors have an agenda that transcends mere maverick investigation or academic inquiry. After all, the Machiavellian intelligentsia behind Judeo - Christianity have always been most aggravated by the exp osure of their fraudulence and connivance and by the dearth of biographical information confirming the existence of their iconic savior. Since the most erudite scholars in the world, down through the ages, have demolished all possible arguments for the phy sical existence of Jesus, as the bible has portrayed him, it would be most gratifying if apparently \"independent\" and \"objective\" researchers from the secular world were to come up trumps. The Church that could never loudly proclaim ecco homo and would sti ll be the chief beneficiary if Jesus' existence were proven and broadcast from the rooftops by some suitably wily, but apparently unaffiliated, bible detective.

A spiritual Christ, on the other hand, as revered by St. Paul and the New Testament's authors can be encountered and experienced at any time by any person (believer and non - believer) at any location of the world. If we are led to confuse the two we are condemned to position our physical Jesus (or at least his attributes) wherever and whenever the spiritual Christ is said to have appeared. The truth falls by the wayside while the spiritual gets confused with the physical and the theological with the historical. I conferred not with flesh and blo od - (Galatians 1:16) ...no evidence exists to support the view that the four Christian gospels give an historical account of the life, suffering and death of a physical Jesus.

The \"Dead Sea Scrolls\" Alas, the scrolls make no mention of the Nazarene Teacher by name - R. Joseph Hoffmann ( Jesus in History and Myth ) The discover y of the Dead Sea Scrolls did not prove to be the major threat to the Church as some scholars were predicting. They were discovered in 1947 and yet the Vatican is still going strong. This is because they contained little that was stunningly controversial. They merely demonstrated that Paul's Christ was not the unique being Christians had been led to believe. He was not a god but a rebel Mess iah, and one of many. Indeed, the Scrolls showed that Jesus was not favored by most Jews and that even within his own community he was a scandal. The authors of the Scrolls would not have tolerated Paul's Jesus and would have been as likely to ostracize or kill Jesus as the Herodians or Romans. W hat the Scrolls controversially showed was that Jesus the man, and Christ the god, were hardly the same entity. They also provided intriguing evidence to show that \"Jesus\" did not live when the New Testament's accou nts say he did. Recent discoveries by revisionist historians have proven to be far more controversial and revealing, and therefore possibly more threatening to the status quo, than anything the Scrolls have to offer. The Egyptian revisionist historian Ah med Osman traces the gospel Jesus back hundreds of years prior to the official dates given for his life. During his researches into the Dead Sea Scrolls and other taboo documents, Osman discovered that the Essenes (presumed to be the composers of the scrol ls) did not speak of Jesus at all, nor of the places, events, and characters that are found in the codified New Testament. As the scrolls came from the Holy Land and covered the period before and after the years when Jesus is generally accepted to have li ved, it was widely hoped that they would provide firsthand evidence to support the gospel stories and shed new light on"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Jewish and Christian history. Far from confirming accepted ideas about the origins of orthodox Christianity, however, the texts contradi ct them - Ahmed Osman ( Christianity: An Egyptian Religion ) The Dead Sea Scrolls made no mention of Jesus Christ or the early Christian church. At the time of their discovery...It has long been known that there was information in the Dead Sea Scrolls damning to Christian beliefs and the church‘s high - level involvement with interpreting the Scrolls fostered a grave element of suspicion. Since the Scrolls were found some six decades ago, close associates of the Vatican were placed in dominant positions in every phase of the investigation and translations of the Scrolls. The priests regulated the flow of information and controlled its release - Tony Bushby ( Bible Fraud ) ...the Qumran writings have no literary parallel to the synoptic Gospels, nor do the Essenes seem to have shown any interest in recording events in such narrative form. For them the experience of their forefathers chronicled in the Bible was all the history they needed; their own situation was but a repetition of what had gone before - R. Joseph Hoffm ann ( Jesus in History and Myth ) Osman discovered that the Essenes (who may not have been a \"Jewish\" sect at all) believed their \"Teacher\" to have lived at least one thousand years earlier and that he was probably the same person mentioned in the Old Testam ent under the name of Joshua , the Son of Nun (from Naue , meaning \"of great strength or courage\"). The later Joshua, mentioned in the Dead Sea Scrolls as the \"Teacher of Righteousness\" to the Essenes (more correctly the Zealots), was considered a reincarnat ion of the original Joshua from the time of Moses. He was considered the Messiah who would live a sorrowful life and die as a martyr. Scholars disagree as to which group really lived at Qumran where the Dead Sea Scrolls were presumably composed. Some belie ve the Essenes to be the authors while others believe the Zealots were responsible. The difference is important since the Zealots were part of the Zadokite Order that dated back to the time of Solomon. We refer the interested reader to the following books on the subject: Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls , by Hershel Shanks; The Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls , by Barbara Thiering; and Dead Sea Scrolls Deception , by Baigent and Leigh. Most scholars regard the Essenes as a Jewish breakaway sect even though a close inspection of their writings indicates that they had little in common with any Jewish group. Their teachings and ways may have been emulated by those we now refer to as \"Jews\" and \"Christians\" but their own identity may have been quite different from those Sadducees who frequented the Jerusalem Temple and the many Pharisaic synagogues of Palestine and Judea. The earlier Joshua (Son of Nun) took over the leadership of the Israelites after Moses died and was one of the “Davids,” that is, a commander of the Israelites (Atonists). There were commanders both before and after his time. For instance, Benjamin of the House of Judah (Yahud) was known as a \"Light - Bearer\" or a \"Lucifer\" that is, again, a reference to a commander or high priest"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"of the sun. The Mas onic Order, that employs a welter of Egyptian symbolism, utilizes titles of this very kind to distinguish its members and chiefs. While Moses lived, Joshua's star burned less brightly. It was only after the death of the Prophet of the Exodus that this othe r great figure of the desert wandering came into his own, and proved himself no less favored of God, or less gifted as a leader of men - John Allegro ( The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth ) Moses's commission to Joshua, signified by the laying on of hands...was confirmed by Yahweh himself - ibid And he (Moses) called to him Joshua, son of Nun, a man approved of by the Lord, that he might be the minister of the people, and of the Tabernacle - (The Damascus Document, An Qumran Text, presumably composed either by the Essenes or the Zealots) Joshua said to the children of Israel \"Come close and hear the Word of Yahweh your God; thus you will know that a living god is among you - (Joshua 3: 9 - 10) Clearly then, if this Joshua was a direct descendant of Moses , it is probable that he too was of Egyptian heritage. W e might inquire then whether this is the secret that the Christian hierarchs wished to conceal and that motivated their burning of libraries, the persecutions, and the suppression of the Dead Sea Scro lls and other Gnostic and Apocryphal texts? Is their Jesus a sanitized concoction created to edify Romans and other W estern peoples? Is he a made - to - order figure, a persona for a powerful world - dominating religion? And were the persecutions and desecration s perpetrated to prevent those who knew and taught the truth from contradicting the fables of Rome? It would certainly seem so. W e know that the Christian hierarchy desired humanity to regard their Jesus as a unique being. Their stereotype should not be li nked to any previous archetype. He was to be the stand alone savior with no connection to previous pagan heroes or sun - gods. The ties that linked their concoction to previous figures were to be well severed. Nevertheless, a close study of Christian and Jud aic symbolism reveals the truth. The belief in the end, the eschatology of the East Iranian Spitama Zarathustra, which was linked with the belief in a coming world saviour, has been described by H. S. Nyberg (Die Religionen des Alten Orientst, Vol. 34). It subsequently penetrated into Judaism shortly before the time of Jesus and fully determined his message - Hans F. K.

Yet no contemporary record exists that bears witness, directly, or indirectly, to the physical appearance of Jesus. Even more surprising is the absence of any reference to Jesus in the writings of Jewish authors living at the time in Jerusalem or Alexandria, although we know from Talmudic writings that the Jews did know of Jesus, even if th ey refused to accept either that he was the Messiah (Christ) or that he was descended from the House of David - Ahmed Osman ...while it is certain that his disciples have claimed that he appeared to them at this time, not a shred of evidence exists to suppor t the orthodox view that this was the historical Jesus, while, disturbing as the thought may be, substantial evidence - from the Bible itself and the teachings of the early Church Fathers as well as Egyptian history - points to his having lived, suffered a nd died many centuries earlier - ibid Only two of the four gospel authors, Matthew and Luke, refer to the birth of Jesus, but their accounts do not agree.

If Peter had figured so prominently in Apostolic times, and had founded a church at Rome, he certainly deserved more notice from Justin - J. P.

The major"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"spiritual guide and leader of the Essenes was known not as Jesus but as the \"Teacher o f Righteousness.\" He had suffered arrest, punishment, and execution due to the accusation of a rival known as the \"Evil Priest.\" The story of the Essenes and their beliefs is a long one and cannot be told here. W e can but know that the \"Teacher of Righteou sness\" (probably either Joshua, the son of Nun, or John the Baptist) bore an uncanny resemblance to the New Testament Jesus and is considered by many researchers of the Scrolls to definitely be the man later known as Jesus. The problem for biblical scholar s was the fact that this Essenic teacher lived years before Jesus is said to have walked abroad preaching in the Holy Land. The scrolls of the Essenes reveal that passages from the gospels are duplicates of those referring to this \"Teacher of Righteousness \" who lived centuries before. Although the resemblances are striking, however, it does not mean that the two men were one and the same. It merely suggests that they were cut from the same rock or, in other words, that they were adepts from the same college or mystery school. It can also mean that they were two stereotypes based on an earlier archetype; just two more solar heroes from a long, long line. John the Baptist was a leader of the Essenes. He is believed to have lived at Qumran, and he may have been the person referred to in the Dead Sea Scrolls as the “Teacher of Righteousness.” This would have made him the rival of the person called the “Wicked Priest,” that some believe was Jesus. The main enemies of the Essenes, the Roman procurators and Herodian Governors of Judea and Jerusalem, worked closely with the elite Jewish priestarchy known as the \"Sadducees.\" Many scholars, possibly erroneously, consider the Essenes to have been Jewish hardliners (of a Pharisaic tradition) who regarded the Sadducees to be traitors, despising the fact that they and the Roman oligarchs had close social and economic ties. In any case, the Sadducee - Roman connection has rarely been investigated by modern authors. It was the Sadducees who believed and taught that Moses had rec eived two laws from Jehovah, one written and one oral, that is one open and one secret. A most intriguing and suggestive fact about the Essenes is that they arranged their order according to an ancient Druidic astrological scheme. They had three elders att ended by twelve assistants. Perhaps this arrangement was just one more feature appropriated and adapted by the Christians who appear to have closely emulated the Essenes. So we see that even within the ranks massive editing occurred. The Church actively s uppressed what the Essenes alleged in their written works, namely, that Jesus had physically existed earlier than the accepted gospels indicated. This testimony was not to be officially credited or respected. No, the Holy Roman Empire, the Church of Consta ntine, would have none of this particular \"heresy.\" The Essene \"Teacher of Righteousness\" was a Jewish savior or wise man who merely resembled Christianity's official savior. But this likeness was apparently enough for the Church's machinery of deception t o spring into action. These insidious and in some cases blatant \"in - house\" cover - ups are begrudgingly accepted today by most interested parties, both Christian and Jewish, and many are the books that go into the subject."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"There is another major difference b etween the philosophy of the Essenes and the Catholicism of Rome. This concerns the feminine divine principle. Paul's concoction, a Roman hybrid, did not bother much with the female or feminine. God was male, and so were the Messiah and Christ. Any woman w ho attempted to preach to males was to be executed as a heretic. The Alexandrian scholar Hypatia had been torn to pieces for taking this very liberty. Nevertheless, it appears that the feminine principle was esteemed and revered by early Essenes. This was certainly another reason why the Essenic philosophy was not to be included in the Roman dogma. In the Dead Sea Scrolls, texts honoring the feminine Sophia were discovered. These passages clearly emphasize that Judaism, as well as Christianity, has pagan ro ots, and reveal that Christianity has little to do with the teachings of the Essenes after all.

This theory is strengthened considerably when we understand that the Essene authors, living on site in Palestine, never mentioned any of the places, events or characters that we find in the New Testament. ...remarkably, in them we find no m ention of the places or characters familiar from the gospel stories - Bethlehem, Nazareth, Jerusalem, King Herod, and John the Baptist, for example - Ahmed Osman ( Christianity: An Egyptian Religion ) In light of this, our point is self - evident.

The case of the Essenes and their \"Teacher\" is an excellent acid test when it comes to estimating the machinations of the Vatican and their coteries within Christianity and Judaism.

Even the most well - worn fami liar Christian concepts can now be seen as having had a completely different meaning in the context of first - century Palestine - Picket and Prince ( Templar Revelation ) Before the discovery of the so - called \"Nag Hammadi Library\" (of 52 ancient scrolls) we k new next to nothing about the Gnostics, the mysterious Gentile Christian sects that also wrote of a Jesus living centuries before the official dates. Almost all that was known about them was gleaned from the writings of their detractors and suppressors, me n such as the Bishop Irenaeus of Lyon. Gnostics did not attribute much meaning to a physical Jesus even though they did believe in one. For the majority of the Gnostics it was Jesus' divine presence that was important. And this is most significant since th is was also the mindset of the Solar Cult members of ancient Egypt. The interest of the Gnostics was on the archetypal rather than stereotypical level. Jesus was a symbol of what all men can and must become. Their Jesus was a spiritual model and not a phys ical being whose earthly lifestyle mattered. Naturally, this was heresy, and the dogmatists set out to annihilate the Gnostics. The great Gnostic masters, men like Valentinus and Basilides, were persecuted and exiled. Purges of Gnostic sects continued up u ntil the Middle Ages while the misinterpretation and suppression of their teachings continues to this very day. The Church did not want the teachings of the Gnostics to be studied. They knew only too well that Gnosticism was nothing more or less than Egypt ian religion. It was the faint echo of the theologies of Egypt mixed with many other religious and spiritual traditions commonly found in Hellenistic Alexandria long after the great dynasties had passed into oblivion.

Even the Apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon says that God did not create death. The Supreme God and the Creator of the World were with the Gnostics two different Beings, and the latter was looked upon as the God of the Jews and the author of the Mosaic law.

Naturally, the existence and teachings of these Gnostic Mandeans has been obscured by the hegemonic forces from Rome and London. The Iraqi Mandeans are now prac tically extinct. Until recently academics thought that the Mandean's denial that they came from a breakaway Jewish sect was untrue, but now it is recognized that they have no Judaic roots.

This has never been stated in so many words by writer s on the Cathars but it is a self - evident fact given that women were returned to positions of authority, that nature was venerated, that the sect adopted an optimistic attitude toward existence, and that rigid hierarchies were abolished. The Druids had onc e been strong in the very region where the Cathars had situated themselves, and so it is not surprising that elements of their ancient religion permeated this ostensibly Christian movement. Unfortunately the Cathars, like so many other Gnostic sects, paid a heavy price for their theological heresy and effrontery. In 1139 the Church began calling councils to condemn the Cathars and all who supported them .

Let us note that although these writers came from Islamic, Jewish, and Christian backgrounds they did not allow limited allegiances to hinder them in their searches and revelations. Concerning the bizarre Book of Genesis , that has caused so much dissent among the genders, author Laurence Gardner writes: ...the opening verses of Genesis were composed in the sixth century BC, roughly 1400 yea rs after the time of Abraham, 2000 years after Noah and 3500 years after the Mesopotamian flood - (Genesis of the Grail Kings) On the New Testament, Gardner writes: When the criteria for Gospel selection were determined at the Council of Carthage in AD 397 , it was first stipulated that the authorized New Testament Gospels must be written in the names of the original twelve apostles. Matthew was, of course, an apostle, as was John, but neither Luke nor Mark were named in the original twelve. Thomas, on the o ther hand, was one of the original apostles and yet the Gospel in his name was excluded - ( Genesis of the Grail Kings ) Concerning the origin of the Old Testament, Egyptian author Moustafa Gadalla, the man who has revealed Tutankhamun to be the prototype fo r the Christian Jesus Christ, writes: Our standard translations of the Old Testament are based on the Massoretic Hebrew text, that came into existence in the ninth or tenth centuries A.D. This text was originated in the second century A.D. after a council had been assembled in Jamnia...in A.D.70. At Jamnia the council agreed to the form and content of the Old Testament - ( Historical Deception ) In a letter by an unknown author about 100 BC, Ptolemy II, the King of Egypt (285 - 247 BC), ordered a Greek translatio n of the Bible.

Joseph Hoffman and Gerald A. Larue, we learn about the contradictions and differences that exist between the four gospel accounts. Everyone knows that the four canonical gospels unambiguously attest that Jesus lived and died in Pontius Pilate's Palestine. Four gospels sound impressive, but this is not multiple testimony, as these works are not independent of each other. For instance, Matthew and Luke take a subs tantial portion of their material verbatim from Mark, and much of their remaining material is drawn either from another common source (not extant) or taken by Luke directly from Matthew. As for the fourth gospel, it on the one hand markedly fails to substa ntiate many elements of the story told by the other three, and on the other has been shown to have reworked source material that resembled theirs. Furthermore, it is now widely admitted that all four are the work of unknown authors - their titles \"accordin g to Matthew,\" etc, resulted from what F. W. Beare has called \"second - century guesses\" - authors not personally acquainted with Jesus who were writing between forty and eighty years after his supposed lifetime. Much in these gospels is mere legend, the mut ually exclusive virgin - birth stories of Matthew and Luke being but a particularly striking example. These gospels were written after Palestinian Christianity had been destroyed or dispersed in the Jewish War with Rome that had culminated in the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 and had occasioned a serious break in continuity that made it very difficult for Christian writers of later date, including the evangelists, to have reliable knowledge of what had been going on in Palestine in the first half of the century. It is thus not surprising that the author of the gospel of Luke, who is also the author of the Acts of the Apostles, is in complete confusion over the chronology of events that we know (from independent sources) occurred there at that time . From The Christ Myth, by the great scholar Arthur Dewes, we discover how the scriptures were falsely dated: Of the works of the Old Testament neither the Psalms, nor the proverbs, nor the so - called Preacher, nor the Book of Wisdom, can be connected with the his torical kings David or Solomon, whose names they bear, and the prophet Daniel is just such a fictitious personality as the Enoch and the Ezra of the Apocalypses known under their names. ...the so - called Five Books of Moses are the literary product of an age much later than the one in which Moses is supposed to have lived. From the work of Elmer H. Gruber, the scholar who has expertly revealed the innumerable similarities between Jesus and the Indian Buddha, we read about the destruction of scriptures that con tradicted the agenda of the hierarchs: During the early period of the Christian movement the multitude of often contradictory texts was so great that the young Church saw only one way of preserving the faith from"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"splitting into numerous sects: assembling a canon of writings and destroying rejected apocryphal (hidden) texts - ( The Original Jesus ) Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky also spoke of the fear that prompted the early Christian hierarchs to eradicate the evidence that revealed the pagan elements of t heir religion: Every event in the life of Jesus, from his virgin birth to his final crucifixion and resurrection, had been copied from the stories of the pagan gods. Every dogma and ritual in the Christian Church had its pagan counterpart. These facts were known to the entire pagan world and as the Church continued to borrow from the pagans in an ever - increasing measure, it became more and more difficult for her to maintain her claim of uniqueness. So long as pagan schools existed, the Church could not with out contradiction represent herself as the sole repository of knowledge. So long as pagan books existed, the Bible would not be accepted as the only revelation of God. So long as pagan philosophers lived and taught, the dogmatic assertions of the Church Fa thers would be questioned. There was but one course for the Church - to destroy all the evidences of her plagiarisms by wiping out the pagan schools, the pagan records, even the pagan philosophers themselves - ( Isis Unveiled ) From the relatively recent and exemplary writings of Egyptian revisionist Ahmed Osman, the investigator who discovered the probable identities of the biblical Joseph, David, and Solomon, we learn about the Gnostic refutation of the Judaic Old Testament stories, and the infamous Council of Loadicia. It was at this Council that Constantine ordered the testaments combined in one book, thus ensuring the common roots of Christianity and Judaism were forever acknowledged. In Alexandria, which had become the center for Greek culture and philos ophy, it was Valentinus, the prominent Gnostic leader, who led the assault upon the text of the Old Testament in the second century AD, claiming that certain parts of the Pentateuch and the Prophets were not authentic, while the great Ptolemy, the astrolog er and geographer of Italian origin, raised the basic question of the origin of the Pentateuch...Ptolemy concluded that the five books of the Pentateuch attributed to Moses could not possible have come from this single author, but must have been compiled by Moses from three sources - God, Moses himself and the Elders. However, with the acceptance of Christianity in AD 313 by Constantine the Great, who made it the official religion of the Roman Empire, and the decision of the Christian Council of Loadicia in 3 63 to include the Old Testament books (the Greek Text) in the Christian canon, belief in the divine inspiration and authorship of the Scriptures finally made the Bible the only acceptable historical source up to the end of the Middle Ages - ( The Hebrew Pha raohs of Ancient Egypt ) Benedict Spinoza (1632 - 1677) who was a follower of Hobbes, also entirely rejected the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, insisting that the books from Genesis to Kings II were the work of Ezra, the scribe and Hebrew scholar who li ved during the fifth century BC.

The mention of Christ occurs in the twenty - fifth chapter were the author is discussing events in the reign of Claudiu s (AD 41 - 54), who had succeeded as the fourth emperor after the assassination of Caligula. Suetonius makes a brief mention of riots that took place in Rome in AD 49: ―As the Jews, at the instigation of Chrestus, were constantly causing riots, he (Claudius) drove them out of Rome.‖ In the light of gospels, this is a surprisingly early date, given the slow nature of travel at that time...Chrestus, a common name in Rome, must have been substituted for the Greek Christus, because the two names were pronounced a like and Suetonius thought - wrongly - that someone called Christ was in Rome at the time, instigating the riots - ( Christianity: An Egyptian Religion ) By the first half of the first century AD, the Therapeutae had also spread far and wide. Philo, whose br other was head of the Jewish community in Alexandria, visited Rome during the brief reign of Caligula (AD 37 - 41) to protest at the emperor‘s order that the Jews should place his image in their temple and worship it. It was at this early date, on his return from Rome, that - according to Eusebius...one of the early church fathers...Philo set down his most important work, The Contemplative Life, in which he described the Therapeutae as ―citizens of heaven and of the universe, and truly acceptable to the father an d creator of the world.‖ He also recorded that the Therapeutae were ―to be found throughout each of the districts and nomes, and particularly around Alexandria.‖ Eusebius identified the Therapeutae as the earliest Christian church in Egypt - ibid From the pen of the mighty Kersey Graves we read of the industry that manufactured the so - called \"word of god:\" The Gospels and Epistles thus voted into favor were not arranged together in the form of an authentic Bible until...the Council of Laodicea in the year 3 53.

After his vision he went on to issue the Ed ict of Milan, in 313 AD, which legalized Christianity throughout the Empire. Shortly thereafter, it became the fastest spreading religion. Constantine‘s conversion to Christianity is still shrouded in mystery and led to the most famous forgery in European history, that which became known as the Donation of Constantine. This document purports to be a signed document by Constantine and its principal feature is to grant the bishop of Rome - the Pope - temporal authority over the city of Rome and the entire Rom an Empire. Although there are many glaring factual errors in the text of the document, which by themselves show the document to be a forgery, the Donation of Constantine was accepted as genuine until the 15th Century, and was used by the Catholic Church to claim political power in not only the Roman Empire but also, ultimately, in all nominally Christian lands. Eventually, the Donation of Constantine was rejected as false - but by then the Church had established itself in almost all of Europe, its power fou nded on a forgery . The books now contained in the Old Testament were largely oral before 300 BC, although some had been written down by Jewish rabbis. Through contact with the Jews in Ptolemaic Egypt, King Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285 - 246 BC) is credited w ith ordering the translation of the Jewish religious books into Greek. The Christian version of the Old Testament was only established as a comprehensive work by the scribe Origen around 250 AD, and up until that time only loose translations of the Ptolema ic Greek work formed the basis of Christian teaching .

Charlemagne (742 - 814): the Merovingian and Carolingian Emperor, close friend of Popes, the hammer of the Saxons, he butchered any who would not convert to Christianity Fortunately, the object of such industry may be grasped by a brief overview of the mentality and behavi or of Christianity's champion Emperor Carolus Magnus, the king of the Franks, who was crowned Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Leo III. Such an examination suffices to frame the whole frightful picture. Author Michael Howard, in his excellent book Occult Conspiracy reveals that Charles \"the Great\" (Charlemagne) was a key member of the French Masonic and Rosicrucian lodges. The Emperor Charlemagne for the Holy Roman Empire, who was an early patron of the masons who built the Gothic cathedrals, is sai d to have founded a Rosicrucian lodge at Toulouse in the ninth century CE. In 898 CE a second lodge was established in France and in the year 1000 a group of heretical Roman Catholic monks founded the first Rosicrucian college which flourished in secret fr om the eleventh to the sixteenth centuries . In his masterly work, March of the Titans , historian Arthur Kemp details the diabolical manner in which Charlemagne and his henchmen supplanted the natural religion of the ancients and imposed their masonic theol ogy upon the world: In 768, Charlemagne started a 32 year long campaign of what can only be described as genocidal evangelism against the Saxons under his control in western Germany. The campaign started with the cutting down of the Saxon‘s most sacred tr ee, their version of the World Tree...In 772, at Quierzy, he issued a proclamation that he would kill every Saxon who refused to accept Jesus Christ, and from that time on he kept a special detachment of Christian priests who doubled as executioners, and in every Saxon village in which they stopped, these priests would execute anybody who refused to be baptized.

The New Testament and the Story of Jesus It has always been an unfailing source of astonishme nt to the historical investigator of Christian beginnings, that there is not one single word from the pen of any Pagan writer of the first century of our era, which can in any fashion be referred to the marvelous story recounted by the Gospel writers. The very existence of Jesus seems unknown - G. R. S. Meade ( Did Jesus Live 100 BC? ) The majority of modern writers on Jesus, such as Dominic Crossan, Elaine Pagels, Barbara Thiering, Brian McLaren, James Tabor, Earl Doherty, Bart Ehrman, Tony Bushby, and many others, continue to seek his origins in Jewish culture. They take their lead from Paul, the chief biographer of Jesus. From Paul we learn of the humble origins of the strange son of a carpenter from Nazareth who frequented and preached in Jerusalem, Caesar ea, and Galilee, and whose Jewish disciples spread his word far and wide. A few authors have dismissed this Jewish ancestry as well as the existence of a Jesus. Some have located his origins in remoter periods, noting his similarity to the Mosaic Joshua, t he Mandean John the Baptist, and even to pagan heroes and deities. Thanks to more iconoclastic and penetrating writers, however, we get nearer the truth concerning Jesus and his teachings. Authors such as Moustafa Gadalla, Ahmed Osman, Laurence Gardner, an d Ralph Ellis, provide us with controversial propositions and theories contradicting, and even demolishing, the bland conventional fare of those who hesitate to venture beyond the established spiel concerning the enigmatic \"savior\" of mankind.

Upon close inspection, it appears that the Epistles and the Gospels do not agree with one another in several key areas pertaining to the life of Jesus. Indeed, scholars like Earl Doherty wonder how th e Epistles ever came to be included along with the Acts of Paul and four Gospels since the picture they each conjure of the savior differ so greatly. Doherty reminds us of the many varying traditions that were synthesized by the Gospel authors and he empha sizes the two main traditions that matter most from a biblical point of view - The \"Galilean\" and the \"Jerusalem.\" From a fusion of these two main traditions came the Pauline story of the life of Jesus Christ. The Gospel of Mark , that was the outcome and s ynthesis of the Galilean tradition, was the basis of the other three accounts, those of Matthew, Luke, and John. Some scholars believe these three were fairly direct copies of the older Gospel of Mark . According to Doherty, the Galilean tradition was: ...a Jewish preaching movement centered in Galilee...The itinerant prophets of this new \"counter - culture\" announced the coming of the kingdom of God and anticipated the arrival of a heavenly figure called the Son of Man who would judge the world - ( The Jesus P uzzle ) Originally, the so - called \"Jerusalem\" tradition of Christianity (pre - Gospel era) was a distinct movement and interpretation. Doherty writes that it: ...came to life in numerous places across the eastern half of the Roman empire, expressing a great v ariety of ideas. It too was a preaching movement, built on the Jewish base but combining Jewish and pagan traditions. It was conducted by apostles who might roam far afield to deliver their message and establish communities of believers So, it was from thi s early \"Jerusalem Church\" that the pagan ideas were in evidence in Christianity. Since these pagan elements remained authors, such as Doherty, might conclude that it was this Church that influenced Paul and the Gentile believers of later years. Since the New Testament was composed centuries after the savior was allegedly alive, we can see how important it was for these pagan elements to remain. W ithout them Christianity would, conceivably, never have coalesced and would have had a far weaker influence on W estern peoples. It would have remained a belief system of small Eastern sects and would not have constellated into a homogenous doctrine despite its enigmatic central heroic figure. This Jerusalem Church had Gentile converts and its version of religion was already being accepted by W esterners who formed their own communities, such as the Gnostics.

These mutual crossover influences gave rise to a new faith which was a hybrid o f both cultures, and a product which would shape the future of the Western world - Earl Doherty ( The Jesus Puzzle ) W e would do well to question why Gentiles were so eager to convert to an ostensibly Jewish religion. W hy did they not hearken back to the tr aditions and theologies of Egypt, the greatest and most enlightened civilization other than Greece and Rome? W e must address what the Jewish religion had that so bedazzled converts. It is admitted, after all, that Christianity encapsulated many pagan motif s. But so did Egypt. Our question is made more poignant when we realize how much of Christianity turns out to be Egyptian in character. So, again, why was there not an Egyptian revival? W hy was Jesus accepted and not Horus, or Osiris, or Serapis? One answe r could be that the vast majority of intelligent converts already knew that Christianity was close to Egyptian religion. Unlike people today they would have understood Christianity's doctrine to be nothing more than a rescripting of solar theology from Egy pt's many esoteric colleges. W e do not see any other reason as to why such conversion would have taken place given that the world's wealthiest and most erudite scholars and dignitaries were reverers of Egyptian occult traditions. After all, the schools, li braries, societies, and learned teachers of Alexandria, the great capital of learning and spirituality, were hardly distant memories to educated peoples of early centuries. Could Jesus have borne such a close resemblance to the gods of Egypt that his reput e and status was ensured? W as he put forward as another Adonis, Mithras, or Apollo? Indeed, despite unsustainable refutations, the Pauline Christ's similarity to the pagan gods, particularly those of Egypt, is rather conspicuous. Clearly, the traditions (G alilean and Jerusalem, etc) were synthetic, and so was the figure of Jesus. He too was a composite of many pagan heroes and gods stretching back to antiquity. He was the character scripted by adroit myth makers who knew that the world would accept their li terary hero. Man's imagination would be their ally and the promises spoken of by their savior would be perfect incentives. If the world was made a hellish place, and if ordinary men and women were stripped of dignity and rights, the promise of eternal life by way of a glorious, forgiving, miracle - working savior would surely prove attractive. Entire civilizations bowed before Earthly kings and pharaohs and they would likewise bow to a god made flesh who held keys to the kingdom of heaven. Once the idea of su ch a being and his life were installed in the human mind the fertile imagination would take over and do its work.

Few people are aware of the lack of success enjoyed by historians and scholars when it comes to historically placing the significant places, events, and characters mentioned throughout the Old and New Testaments. Indeed, it is not in the interests of Jewish or Christian propagandists to let it be commonly known how few and far between are the historical proofs concerning the physical existence of the dramatis personae of the bible. The dearth of evidence has not prevented people from believing that the characters moved abroad in the world, or from believing that the events p ortrayed took place. Mulling over the problem of corroboration, the Jewish historian, Joseph Meleze Jewski, summarized the dilemma thusly: We all know how deeply the origins of Israel, from Abraham to Moses, are rooted in the Egyptian past. The long sojour n of the Hebrews in Egypt was the prelude to the three basic events in Judaic history: the Exodus, the giving of the Torah, and the Mosaic covenant. But should a historian attempt to bring the biblical account into correspondence with available historical and archaeological data, he would be hard pressed indeed, since the two are vastly dissimilar. The style and contents of the Pentateuch (the Greek noun for the first five books of the Bible) are not those of the royal hieroglyphs. The Egyptian archives bea r no trace of an Abraham or a Moses. Conversely, neither Genesis nor Exodus contains the slightest reference to the great political events studding the remote epoch these books are supposed to treat. Biblical Egypt and Egyptological Egypt have few points i n common, and the few they have are debatable ones. The part played by hypotheses and delicate choices is all the more considerable - ( The Jews of Egypt: From Rameses II to Emperor Hadrian ) Since this historian's book was published, in 1995, there have bee n new discoveries to substantially alter this predicament. Brave investigators, not content to go along with the consensus concerning the past, have labored to prove beyond most rational doubt that some of the most important biblical characters had been ca refully based on earlier historical personalities.

In his book entitled Criticism of the Gospel History, Bauer horrified his readers by announcing that, in his opinion, the Gospel of Matthew (at that tim e considered the earliest Gospel) was composed by a single author during the time of the Roman Emperor Hadrian. Bauer stressed that Jesus of the gospels was a character without historical substance and was the product of a scribe's fertile imagination. For his controversial suppositions and flagrant free - thought, professor Bauer was removed from his privileged position at the University of Bonn. Nevertheless, his iconoclastic book was one of a few that finally compelled rational thinkers to take biblical ac counts not as precise historical records but as highly subjective theological renderings of history. This is not to imply that the authors of the New Testament were unscrupulous opportunists. They were not falsifiers of history, they were inventors of it. Ultimately, their concern was not history but mythology , and the world would do well to consider and comprehend the difference between history and mythology. A historical event takes place once at a particular time and at a particular place. A mythological event is not so constrained. It can take place in the same manner anywhere at any time. A myth is beyond time and space. Those who undertook the job of establishing Jesus as monogenes - the only begotten son of god - were mythicists not historians.

The passages found in his Antiquities of the Jews were believed to be the strongest independent evidence confirming the historical existence of Jesus. In the fourth chapter of Book 18 of Jos ephus' massive tome there exists a single brief passage that mentions Jesus. It is this passage that delighted the early Christians whose beliefs were somewhat compromised and threatened by the dearth of independent proof concerning the historicity of Jesu s. The passage supposedly composed by Josephus, is as follows: Now, there was about this time, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works - a teacher of such men as receive truth with pleasure. He drew over to him b oth many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ; and when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the Cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him, for he prepared these and ten thou sand other wonderful things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him are not extinct to this day But to the horror and consternation of Christians all over the world, this passage was, during the sixteenth century, proven to be a blat ant forgery. It was worthy of doubt since no contemporary historian, or any coming after who knew Josephus' works, mentioned this passage. This omission was especially startling in the case of the Church Father Origen who wrote many hundred books and cover ed every aspect of Christian history. In Origen's voluminous work there is no mention of Jesus as a man and no quote from, or reference to, Book Eighteen, Chapter Four, of Josephus. The spurious passage (like another in Book Twenty) was an interpolation an d had been inserted into the works of Josephus by a later unnamed \"editor\" or compiler, no doubt some monk who decided to edit history in order to give Christians \"proof\" for their Jesus. The passage also mentions that Jesus was accepted as the so - called \" Christ.\" This is also patently spurious since most Jews did not accept Paul's version of Jesus as the \"Christ.\" This concept meant something only to pagans. Additionally, the Romans (like the Egyptians) were already familiar with the term \"Chrestus\" (meani ng \"anointed\") used for their own gods and emperors. Thus the term \"Christ\" would not have denoted anything particularly unusual and would actually have offended both the orthodox Jews of Jerusalem and the Nazarene Church (those said to have known the phys ical rabbi Jesus). ...this celebrated Testimonium Flavianum (The Testimony of Flavius), which characterized Jesus as a man of miracles and a successful teacher, was certainly not written by Josephus - Elmar R.

The Flavians , and other Roman patricians (such as the Pisos, Aemili, Claudia, Julia, Manlia, Cornelii, Fabii, Scipiones, Gracchi, etc), despised the religion of the Jews but were clever enough to indulge it for the sake of order. They installed a non - Jewish dynasty to rule the region - the Herodian - and cultivated profitable political affiliations with the powerful and wealthy Sadducees. Their main opposition came from lower class Jews and from the families considered those from whom the famous \"Messiah\" would arise. The most illustrious of these rebel families was the Maccabees.

In his book The Jesus Puzzle, that examines the similarities and differences between the Jerusalem and Galilean traditions, he writes of a possi ble origin to the story of Jesus: ...the Passion narrative as a whole follows a known generic model. That is, there is a type, or genre, of tale found throughout centuries of Jewish writing, both Biblical and apocryphal, which bears a strong resemblance to the story of Mark's Jesus. This tale tells of a righteous individual who is conspired against and falsely accused, who remains obedient to God and puts trust in him, who undergoes trial and suffering, finally to be condemned to death. At the last moment, God intervenes miraculously to rescue the protagonist and he or she is vindicated, shown to have been innocent of the charges. Finally, as a reward for the ordeal, the innocent one is raised and restored to a high position at court or in the community, and the adversaries are discredited. In later versions of the tale, the protagonist actually suffers death, but is exalted in heaven after death. The author of this passage is convinced that these Jewish tales and legends are the best bet for the origin of th e story of Jesus appearing in the Gospel of Mark that was the basis for the Gospels of Luke and Matthew. W hat he does not state, however, is that these mythic sagas are hardly unique to the Jews. Stories such as those he outlines predate the rise of the Je ws by thousands of years, although one would not know this from Doherty's writings or from those authors whose monomania it is to discover the origins of Jesus within the Jewish tradition. The author never reminds his readers that the hero myth that he out lines stretches back to Egypt and is to be found in many other traditions - the Germanic, Indian, Scandinavian, Irish, and so on. The Jesus story is, like most of the bible, an Astro - Theological story first composed by astrologers who noticed the passage o f the sun through the heavens. This knowledge is what led the scribe John to alter the dates of Jesus' crucifixion. He contradicts Mark, Luke, and Matthew, and places the crucifixion of Jesus on the eve of the Passover and not one day after it. This mythma ker at least knew the sun's astrological birthday and wanted his character's death and resurrection to correspond to the sun's transition and renewal.

Osman declares these Hyksos to be the same people as the Israelites. He argues that the Hyksos Kings of the Egyptian 13th dynasty, who ruled for approximately 300 years, are the ancestors of those referred to as Israelites and Levites. During the eighteenth dynasty, their leader was Pharaoh Akhenaton, who was himself either a physical or ideological descendant of the Hyksos.

The city of Ur was not in Mesopotamia at all. It was not near the Euphrates and Tigris, as most beli eve, but on the Nile. All is made clear, regarding Abraham and Sarah's traversal into Egypt, when we realize what biblicists meant by the term \"Egypt.\" As Ralph Ellis so brilliantly points out, the name Egypt was employed by the composers of the Old Testam ent to denote Thebes in Lower Egypt. This was the city and region controlled by the adversaries of the Hyksos. It was considered a separate region, with different rulers, gods, customs, and politics. So, it was not the country of Egypt that Abraham visited , but Thebes within Egypt. Official history tells us that the oppressive Hyksos were eventually expelled from the country by the Pharaoh Ahmose I (1575 - 1550 BC) who led the Egyptian people in rebellion against the tyrannical invader dynasty. However, we be lieve the upper classes of the Hyksos invaders were not expelled. W e believe they maintained senior positions at the pharaoh's court and great temples of the sun at Gizeh, Tanis, Heliopolis, Amarna, Avaris, and Alexandria. The upper strata of the Hyksos pe ople had clearly married in with the native Egyptian line, since even Tuthmosis IV and his son Amenhotep III were of mixed blood. Some Egyptologists believe that Amenhotep III was the father of both Smenkhare and Tutankhamun, and given that this is true, i t would have mean that these two Atonist pharaohs were also of mixed blood. With a similar mindset as Dr. Karl Abraham and Dr. Sigmund Freud, the authors Ahmed Osman and Moustafa Gadalla both insist that the biblical Moses was the Pharaoh Akhenaton and tha t the expulsion of Moses from Egypt during the later eighteenth dynasty was, in fact, the expulsion of the \"broken king\" Akhenaton. The scene at Sinai, the subsequent move to Jerusalem, and the eventual splitting of the twelve tribes, were events that occu rred not to humble oppressed captives but to an arrogant and wealthy royal clan, followers of a pharaoh considered the father of monotheism . Soon after arrival at Sinai legend has it that Moses died. His place as leader of the Levites (Atonists) was taken by a mysterious man called Joshua.

The reason for their denial is because they know what Christians are not supposed to ever know. The Jewish elite know that Jesus lived one hundred centuries earlier.

He may have based his Jesus upon Joshua, Moses, Aaron, and other earlier leaders of the Levites. To the hardliner Essene, J oshua was the solar Messiah about to make a physical return.

Sigmund Freud Analyzes the Past No consideration, however, will move me to set aside truth in favor of supposed national interests - Sigmund Freud In 1939, the year before he died, the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, published one of his least known and least well - received books, entitled Moses and Monotheism. This book is not only one of a kind but is, in our opinion, one of the most important books ever written. It is not a surprise to us that it was composed by one of the greatest geniuses the world has ever hosted. The book‟s main thesis asse rts that the famous biblical patriarch, found as a child on the Nile in a basket of reeds, who received the Commandments at the burning bush, who transmitted a new religion of light, and led the “chosen people” out of their captivity, was a chief dignitary , priest, or minister of Pharaoh Akhenaton. Freud's own history and significance has been widely discussed and there are thousands of volumes published on his remarkable life and work. And yet, few scholars have bothered to consider the significance of his revisionist historical insights. Moreover, it is not by chance that the Freud archives in New York City are off limits to the vast majority of scholars. The executive responsible for Freud's untimely demise have a great deal to lose should his discoveries concerning the origins of Christianity be made known to the world at large. Sigmund Freud was an expert on history and spent a great deal of time collecting archaeological relics from all over the world. He was an expert on Grecian history and mythology a nd idiosyncratically named many of his Sigmund Freud - The Vien nese author, historian, and founder of the School of Psychoanalysis,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"psychological complexes and syndromes after gods and goddesses from his beloved Greece. He was also fascinated with Egypt's past and kept abreast of the many archaeological explorations taking place in that land of my stery and intrigue. The eclectic and brilliant man fully understood that the Jewish people would be extremely loath to accept his controversial theories concerning their origins. Nevertheless, he proceeded bravely with his revisionist analysis of Jewish hi story. This resilience and commitment proved him to be an ardent servant of humanity and champion of truth. Unlike so many in this world, Dr. Freud was not inhibited by the reactions and diatribes he knew would rain down upon him. There was not a shadowy n iche of the human psyche he did not delve into and so, when it came to history, his inquiries were no less discerning. was cold - bloodily murdered for what he knew and wrote about Judaism, Egypt, and secrets of the bible W e consider his findings, on the whole, to be accurate and we intend to carry on his work to uncover the actual origins, not only of the so - called \"Jewish\" people but, more importantly, of the religion known as Judeo - Christianity. T o present our thesis and profess Moses to have been Akhenaton without paying due honor to those who initiated speculations of this kind would be unthinkable. Therefore, we dedicate our research, in part, to Sigmund Freud and his quest for answers in this world of wall - to - wall duplicity and fakery. Taking the lead from his friend Dr. Karl Abraham (who believed as we do that Moses was Akhenaton), Freud long pondered why the Egyptian identity of Moses had been obscured. He said that one could only guess at why there was such reticence on behalf of the majority of historians to accept it. He was puzzled, since it was quite obvious to him that the name \"Moses\" was Egyptian. Of course, we can hazard a good guess as to why Egyptologists had chosen to gloss over this intriguing anecdote. They could not afford the truth to come out about Moses' actual identity. Had it not b een for Freud's tenacious inquisitiveness and, later, that of his friend and student Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky, our attention may never have been drawn to its significance. ...we learn that the Egyptian princess who saved the babe from the waters of the Ni le gave him his name, adding the etymological explanation: Because I drew him out of the water. But this explanation is obviously inadequate...it is nonsensical to credit an Egyptian princess with a knowledge of Hebrew etymology, and secondly, that the wat er from which the child was drawn was probably not the water of the Nile - Sigmund Freud ( Moses and Monotheism )"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"In its original Hebrew, the name Moses is Moshe. As the Egyptian equivalent of the letters \"sh\" as the simple \"s\" sound, Moshe would be pronounc ed Mose in Egyptian, a word which simply means \"son.\" The first Greek translators of the Old Testament certainly interpreted it this way. When the Greeks later occupied Egypt in the fourth century BC, the Egyptian word Mose became Mosis. In the Greek versi on of the Bible, Moses' name was actually written Mosis, from which we now get the name \"Moses\" - Graham Philips ( Act of God ) Another major question for Freud concerned why the Israelites who (if we are to believe the Old Testament) were slaves in Egypt wo uld suddenly, during their years of alleged oppression, take to the ardent worship of one god. W hy would they follow in the footsteps of Akhenaton, the man long considered to be the world's first monotheist? Of this idiosyncrasy Freud critically wrote: Wit h the Jews the political conditions were most unfavorable for a development away from the idea of an exclusive national God towards that of a universal ruler of the world. Whence, then, did this tiny and impotent nation derive the audacity to pass themselv es off as the favorite child of the sovereign Lord? The question of the monotheism among the Jews would thus remain unanswered or else one would have to be content with the current answer that it was the expression of their particular religious genius. We know that genius is incomprehensible and unaccountable and it should therefore not be called upon as an explanation... Freud was well placed to winkle out answers to this historical conundrum. He saw things psychologically as well as historically and archa eologically. He was the leader of the school of psychoanalysis in Vienna and he possessed a mind highly trained to observe and analyze minutiae. He had trained himself to see that which other people with ordinary minds and partial perception do not see. Moreover, he also possessed the mental resilience and imagination to draw conclusions from seemingly insignificant details and fragments. It is not a wonder that Freud found Moses (our Akhenaton) fascinating. To so many, Moses was a superlative hero. Inde ed, the name Moses means “hero” in ancient Assyrian. And if there was anything that Freud had analyzed it was the hero. He understood that, mythologically speaking, a man becomes a hero after he combats and defeats his first major rival, his own father. Af ter his fell deed, the victorious son gains the supremacy and ends his secondary status tribally. He also gains spiritual status. He is no longer the prince but the king, and he acquires the privileges of his rank. He gains The Valley of the Kings, where the isolationist Akhenaton preferred to inter his dead family members"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"respect and has the pick of the women of the tribe. Despite his physical acquisitions, however, the son must live with the guilt of patricide. He has a guilty conscience for his murderous act and for giving vent to his aggressive and acquisitive instincts. In order to live with these com plexes he develops an excuse mechanism, a convenient justification for his violent actions toward the object of his loving and hateful drives. This justification is exceedingly important to the guilt - ridden mind. Anyone who reinforces it is considered a friend and ally whereas those who con tradict it are dire enemies. The justification may work convincingly if the hero can emphasize the overall tyranny of his father and exaggerate his own lowly birth. If he can demonstrate that his actions were born from a desire to improve his lot and overc ome enormous odds then he can be assured the sympathy of others who will identify with him. This identification becomes a key element of the hero's justification complex. And if he succeeds in overcoming the various challenges fate has in store for him, if he rises above every obstacle and follows in the footsteps of his own fathers, he will prove himself fit to rule. As the new king he can demand obedience from underlings and even consider himself a god. In short, he must believe that might is right . Regar dless of his successes, however, the solar hero soon develops a new fear. He must accept that others may conspire to do unto him the same things he has done in order to get where he is. His own sons can justifiably covet his power and seek to overthrow him . Therefore, the hero reigns with doubt, fear, and guilt in his heart. Freud laid out his theory on this tribal conflict in his book Totem and Taboo . His theory on the primordial conflict between tribal fathers and sons has its critics, but we feel it is w orth bearing in mind as we examine the life of Moses (Akhenaton). The genius of Freud was to inquire and show, in Moses and Monotheism , how many similarities existed between the monotheistic religion expounded by the biblical patriarch Moses and that of th e eighteenth dynasty monarch and Atonist Akhenaton. Freud did not conclude, as we do now, that these two were one and the same man, but he situated Moses in the close circle around the sun - worshipping pharaoh. As we have said, he was curious as to why Egyp tologists had not delved more deeply into the etymology of the name \"Moses.\" It is our job to further extrapolate the connections and to emphasize the consequences of this aspect. W e can go much further than Freud and drive home the overall significance of the Egyptian origins of the first king of the so - called \"chosen people.\""},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"They tell you that Moses never lived. I acquiesce. If they tell me that the story that came from Egypt is mythology, I shall not protest; it is mythology.

Nor do they make any allusions to the stories given in Genesis of Creation, Adam and Eve and the Deluge. Although the names of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses are mentioned a few times, nothing is said about their lives and they are treated as if they were merely obscure, legendary figures - Ernest Bu senbark ( Symbols, Sex and the Stars ) One of the problems that intrigued Freud was why Moses, an Egyptian prince raised in the houses of the pharaoh, would go on to reinvent himself as the autocratic leader of a ragbag bunch of slaves and foreigners. W hy wo uld he wish to know, convert, and lead such a motley bunch? Why would he be in a position to not only tell them what to do but to bestow upon them an apparently brand new religion? W hy would he be in a position to introduce them to Jehovah, their new god? Did they not have a god of their own before Jehovah? And if they did have a previous religion why do we hear so little about it in the bible? Additionally, why would the Israelites be motivated to change their beliefs in such a radical way to please a sin gle man? Naturally, our answer to questions of this kind builds upon the Freudian foundation and continues to undermine the traditional historical version of the life of Moses as well as the identity of his followers. Our theory is that the chosen people t hemselves were not lower class foreign contingents living miserable lives within the country. They were not slaves or underlings but powerful and wealthy conquerors of Egypt. The people that \"Moses\" led out of Egypt were, as Freud and others have speculated, nothing less than a powerful pharaonic dynasty. And more controversially, their leader Moses was none other than Akhenaton, phar aoh of the eighteenth dynasty and true originator of their brand of monotheism. Akhenaton frequently emphasized that he, and he alone, was the go - between for this new divine life of Egypt. The sole god of Egypt was now mediated through Akhenaton.

One of the first men to publicly mention the connections between Moses and Akhenaton. Source: Tutankhamun and Other Essa ys ) The connection between the patriarch Moses and the court of Akhenaton, that Freud proved long ago but which has been deliberately downplayed ever since, opens the way for a truer understanding of history, of Egypt, and of the true origins of Judeo - Chri stianity. Had Freud penned Moses and Monotheism in his youth, before being confirmed as one of the greatest intellects ever born, we might never have heard of the book. Fortunately, it was composed late in his life and published just before he died. It is a book that helps to expose one of the most important historical deceptions ever conceived. As his research progressed, Freud's perceptive mind understood that the accepted story of monotheism was just that - a story. He understood that this Moses characte r was not, in fact, its creator and that it existed from the time of Amenhotep III, the father of Akhenaton, and from periods even more remote. The origin of Egyptian monotheism can be traced back a fair distance with some certainty. In the School of Pries ts in the Sun Temple at On (Heliopolis) tendencies had for some time been at work developing the idea of a universal god and stressing his ethical aspects - Sigmund Freud Already under Amenhotep III...the worship of the sun - god was in the ascendant, probab ly in opposition to the worship of Amon at Thebes - ibid Thou art the one, the God from the very beginnings of time, the heir of immortality, self - produced and self - born, thou didst create the earth and make man - (From the Egyptian Book of the Dead ) So, m onotheism was not the creation of Moses (Akhenaton).

So exclusive was this brand of solar religion that it did not relate to the average Egyptian citizen. Even during the reign o f Akhenaton it was not widely accepted.

W e see little to convince us that they just vanished from the face of the Earth after the fall of their champion Akhenaton. W e tend to believe that this same powerful cult from Heliopolis, Amarna, Giza, Tan is, and Avaris, was behind the churches and colleges of Alexandria during the era of the Greek pharaohs and also behind the Christian religion established in Rome. The prevalence of Egyptian symbolism, something that Freud did not examine, strongly endorse s our contention. Freud noted the curious parallels between the life of Moses and Pharaoh Akhenaton and he drew attention to the characteristic hubris of both men. W e know of the boisterousness and ambition of Moses (Akhenaton) from the legends of the Jews : The Jews possess a rich extra - Biblical literature in which are to be found the myths and superstitions that in the course of centuries were woven around the gigantic figure of their first leader and the founder of their religion...One of these legends de scribes in an attractive fashion how the ambition of the man Moses had already displayed itself in his childhood. When Pharaoh took him into his arms and playfully tossed him high, the little three - year - old snatched the crown from Pharaoh's head and placed it on his own - Sigmund Freud ( Moses and Monotheism ) W e emphasize at this point that spurious and preposterous stories, such as this one mentioned by Freud, are just part of the great tapestry of deception covering up the connections between Moses and Akh enaton. It was essential to the authors of the \"holy books\" that Moses, their concocted character, appear to have a separate life of his own. In light of this, any kind of embellishment was satisfactory as long as it served to make Moses appear to be a dif ferent character from Pharaoh Akhenaton. And so we have the outlandish stories of his birth, abandonment, adoption, and criminal history, etc. Most of these stories were simple plagiarization of earlier world myths. The tale of the abandonment on the river was adopted from the life of King Sargon. The scene upon the mountain was gleaned from tales of the lives of King Menes and King Nebo. His \"biographers\" who detailed his time as an exile, shepherd, and adopted son of a strange priest Jethro, knew that the re was nothing original about their stories.

Their concoction would be skillful enough to"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"subtly paraphrase the life of Akhenaton without giving the game away. It was designed to magni fy areas of insignificance and minimize anecdotes of greater significance. Clearly, the traditional tale does reveal that the ambition of this Moses (Akhenaton) was certainly not spiritual in nature. W hat Moses coveted was purely material in nature. It is, to our mind, vital to have this fact out in the open. The tale that tells of the enraged Moses murdering the Egyptian captain also reveals keys to his (Akhenaton's) true nature. W e understand now why this angry, impatient, ambitious, and murderous man wou ld be so beloved by his god Jehovah. Other legends maintain that Moses was \"slow of speech\" and that at Sinai he had his brother Aaron intercede as \"translator.\" There has been much speculation as to what this anecdote means. Did Moses (Akhenaton) have a s peech impediment or was he himself a foreigner from other lands? It may mean that he, Akhenaton, had spent so much of his childhood among the Levites of Avaris (the people of his mother Tiye) that he had not even learned the native Egyptian tongue. His edu cation may have been in a different language. It could also mean that he was himself an instrument for the will of others. There is evidence to suggest that Akhenaton was a co - regent with his own father Amenhotep III. In any case, if Aaron was Moses' inter cessor then could Moses himself not have been one? The bible tells us that he was an intercessor for Jehovah. Could the anecdote about not being able to speak for himself be a literary device indicating that Akhenaton was himself merely a puppet king? Thi s son was sent to live with Tiye‘s relatives in Goshen. He was raised by Tey, the wife of Tiye‘s brother. She was a Levite. Amenhotep was later educated at Heliopolis and as a teenager had lived in Thebes - Laurence Gardner ( Genesis of the Grail Kings ) Fre ud also speculated about the psychic disposition of Moses (Akhenaton) and wondered not only why he was so ardently fixated on the sun and its properties, but why he feared and loathed darkness. He noted how Akhenaton had forbidden the people of Egypt to ve nerate Osiris or to participate in the rites of the Underworld that had been customarily undertaken for thousands of years. The Atonist pharaoh might perhaps have begrudgingly tolerated mention and veneration of Atum Ra (an important sun god of Heliopolis in Lower Egypt) or of Shu and Isis perhaps, but never of Amun Ra (Amen or Amon) of Thebes, or of the primordial Osiris. These gods played no part in the Cult of Atonism. There was no Underworld for Akhenaton. There was no traversal of the twelve stages of the shadow realm, no guides of the dead, and no need to think of anything beyond this life. These theological and cultural changes came as a shock to the understanding of most Egyptians who believed that Osiris was the god who would lead the soul safely th rough the tests that awaited after death. The man who did not reverence Osiris could not possibly enter the afterlife safely and could not hope for salvation. To not believe in Osiris was tantamount to not believing in the soul."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The religion of Osiris, the god of death, was to be abolished. Henceforth the sun was to be the sole source of life, both giver and taker. Magic was no longer to be practiced in order to gain immortality. Everything was to derive from the globe.

D. Noblecour ( Ancient Egypt: The New Kingdom and the Amarna Period ) Pharaoh Akhenaton refu sed to have his people interred in pyramids or mastabas as was the custom before his reign. Instead, he had the dead interred beneath the ground at a new mortuary site in the famous Valley of the Kings west of the Nile river and opposite the great city of Thebes (the modern day Luxor). In other words, Atonists were buried below the Earth and not interred above it. Their focus was this life and not the afterlife. If, therefore, we are to question what was different about Atonism it is this denial of Osirian theology that we are to pay heed to. Atonist solar religion had no \"underworld cycle\" and did not revere the gods of the dead. The significance of this, to a psychologist of Freud's status, cannot be underestimated. From our vantage point it is yet one mor e indicator of the common origins of Levitical (Talmudic) Judaism and Egyptian Atonism. Another innovative feature of the Eighteenth Dynasty was the brand new location selected by the kings for their burial. It appears they abandoned the earlier custom of pyramid building and opted for deep rock - cut tombs instead - Lorraine Evans ( Kingdom of the Ark ) The oldest form of Judaism knows nothing of another world.

Abraham, Moses, Solomon, David, Saul, Muha mmad, and Jesus, like Mithras, Apollo, Hercules, Zoroaster, and other godmen are solar deities. The Atonist priesthood was distinguished by their antipathy to the cults of Amen Ra and Osiris. They ignored these gods and dispensed with rites of the Underwor ld. Is it not a coincidence that this pattern has been followed by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam? Although, on the one hand, this peculiarity serves to make the three solar religions less pagan in type, on the other, it makes them appear very Atonist. M anetho states that Moses received his priestly education and learned all the wisdom of the Egyptians in the city of Heliopolis, in the Delta, the Biblical city of On...the House of the Sun - Godfrey Higgins ( Anacalypsis, 1833) According to Genesis Chapter 4 1: Verse 45, the Hebrew patriarch Joseph married the daughter of the high priest of On. A story survived in Egypt during Roman times which also linked Moses with the city - Graham Philips ( Act of God )"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The oldest seat of the cult of the Sun - god was the famo us city of Anu the On of the Bible, and the Heliopolis of Greek and Latin writers - E.

But total denial can lead to its own kind of pathology. And we assert that it has indeed done so. Apollonian religions, such as Judeo - Christianity, have forced the consciousness of human beings into a polarized and unhealthy state. The Atonists believed shadows disperse once bright light is thrown at them. They were wrong. The shadows merely darken . Dare we speculate then on the peculiar psychological profile of priests and worshippers of the sun who avoid noticing the existence and significance of shadows cast by the light they revere? Of Osiris and his realm no more was to be heard - Georg A. Erman (German Egyptologist) Osiris is completely ignored. He is never mentioned in any record of Akhenaton or in any of the tombs at Amarna - James Henry Breasted ( Dawn of Conscience ) There is complete silence a bout the death - god Osiris and the realm of the dead - Freud We do not obtain from the hymn any clear idea of Akhenaton's conception of evil. There is no reference to the devil serpent, or to the war waged against the sun god in Heliopolitan myth. But it ap pears that as light was associated with life, goodness, and beauty, darkness was similarly filled with death and evil - Donald Mackenzie ( Egyptian Myth and Legend , 1907) The new religion of Paul had, like Atonism, a great deal to do with this denial of Und erworld theology. In Christianity (and in Judaism) a man need not reverence the gods of the dark Underworld. A Christian need not be overly concerned with good deeds. He can just have faith and believe in the god of light. That takes care of everything. In Judaism a man must live a moral life and must strive to do good deeds, although he does not necessarily need to reverence nature. He is to observe a welter of rules and regulations. He must turn away from his body and from nature, honoring the priests and heeding the Torah - a book . Nevertheless, it appears that Paul knew the Underworld theology to be important. Like Osiris, Paul's Christ does descend into hell to preach to damned souls. This motif sampled the descent of pagan heroes and gods.

Freud and the Origin of the Messiah In Moses and Monotheism , Freud discloses a theory for the belief in a Messiah, and in the second coming of suc h a being. He emphasized that it was a consequence of the violent demise of the Jewish Moses after the time of the exile. Most biblical researchers and commentators agree that Moses died soon after reaching Sinai and that the leadership of the exiled peopl es fell to his brother Aaron. Freud wrote: In 1922 Ernst Sellin made a discovery of decisive importance. He found in the book of the Prophet Hosea...unmistakable traces of a tradition to the effect that the founder of their religion, Moses, met a violent e nd, in a rebellion of his stubborn and refractory people...The tradition is not restricted to Hosea; it recurs in the writings of most of the later Prophets, indeed, according to Sellin, it was the basis of all the later expectations of the Messiah. Toward s the end of the Babylonian exile the hope arose among the Jewish people that the man they had so callously murdered would return from the realm of the dead and lead his people - and perhaps not only his people - into the land of eternal bliss So, we see t hat the repressed and palpable guilt of the exiles gave rise to the idea of Messiahship. That which has gone would return again some day. Death was not the end of the great hero. He was a maniac and a demagogue but he would incarnate again to lead his floc k who cannot find their own way in the world. If the people had no direct private or collective connection or pipeline to their adopted god then it follows they would be impatient for the return of the one who did. If their god was distant and remote, an o bject of fear and awe, then surely the mediator would be highly valued. So much for the proximity of a loving god. W ould those who enjoyed the close attention and affection of their god, live in impatient desire for the coming of a Messiah? One hardly thin ks so. The god of the Jews was god of their leader, a projection of his ego. Jehovah was to Moses as Aton was to Akhenaton. The attempt to have the world believe that god was near and dear to those who accompanied the Messianic figure wherever he went cle verly served to obscure this fact. The promise of a new homeland, and of riches, prompted devotion and compliance. Once this leader could not deliver, he was met with rage and killed. In time he became a martyr and getd exalted in reputation and status. He becomes a legend so that his memory will not be forgotten. Moreover, if the chosen ones are made to believe that their departed leader will return, they would be less inclined to stray from the prescribed road and less likely to move from self - will. Terro r of the Lord's vengeance ensured everlasting obsequiousness. Freud understood that the early books of the bible were not"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"composed at the time of Moses. He also understood that there were at least two schools at work composing variants of the stories that appear. He knew that the Jahwistic interpretation is not consistent with the Elohistic . He knew the bible was not an accurate revelation of the past by any means and that hundreds of years elapsed between events that the bible erroneously contrives to have happened at close proximity. That there are two gods and two schools of thought, in the first books of the bible, is of major importance. It shows us that \"history\" was being deliberately, if not methodically, concocted. The significant differences betwee n passages and accounts from the Aramaic and the Hebrew bibles, also emphasizes this fact. The interpretation that was most satisfactory to the powers that be would be the standardized version. When both were seen to have merits, both were included, and we inherited two standardized versions. But the contradictions alert us to the original duplicity. Biblical scholars have conjectured that the Old Testament is composed essentially of four major narratives, the \"J,\" \"E,\" \"JE,\" and \"P\" documents woven togethe r into one. The \"J\" documents are so named because in them God is always referred to as \"Jehovah.\" They are the oldest, written around the ninth century BC, in the southern kingdom of Judah. The \"E\" documents, so called because in them God is referred to a s \"Elohim,\" were written about a hundred years after the \"J\" documents in the eighth century in the northern kingdom of Israel. Scholars assume the \"P\" or \"Priestly\" documents were composed some two - hundred years or so after the \"E,\" about 600 BC. In the f ifth century, Jewish priests combined portions of the \"J\" and \"E\" documents, adding a little handiwork of their own (known as pious fraud), which are referred to as \"JE\" documents, since God in these passages is referred to as \"Jehovah - Elohim\" (translated as \"Lord God\") - Max Dimont ( Jews, God and History ) The distortion of a text is not unlike a murder. The difficulty lies not in the execution of the deed but in the doing away with the traces. One could wish to give the word \"distortion\" the double meaning to which it has a right, although it is no longer used in this sense. It should mean not only: \"to change the appearance of,\" but also \"to wrench apart,\" \"to put in another place.\" That is why in so many textual distortions we may count on finding the sup pressed and abnegated material hidden away somewhere, though in an altered shape and torn out of it original connection. Only it is not always easy to recognize it - Sigmund Freud (on the early books of the bible) Freud did not realize, as most still do no t, that the term Elohim (from Eloah, and Aleim ), that implies a plurality of \"gods,\" simply referred to the Egyptian (and Phoenician - Sumerian) kings and pharaohs who were considered nothing less than living gods. These kings of the Euphrates and the Nile n ot only styled themselves on the gods of ancient pantheons, but were regarded as actual embodiments of and channels for the will of those gods and goddesses. They were the \"Keepers,\" the \"W atchers,\" the \"Elders,\" the \"Kadosh.\" Secondary permutations of the words, Elohim, Nephilim , and Annunaki , refer to these living incarnate gods, the pharaohs of Egypt, and the various stellar, solar, and lunar priestarchies they headed. The Ankh is a symbol of the"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Nephilim, or Annunaki, and their primordial knowledge and royal status. It served the same symbolic purpose as the modern crown, scepter, and mace. Indeed, the very word ankh is a loose rendering of the word Anakim (meaning “great kings” or “giants”) and perhaps of Annunaki , meaning \"heavenly serpents\" or \"those who came down from heaven to earth.” That Judeo - Christianity was not originally monotheistic is demonstrated by the fact that the Elohim are commonly considered identical to Jehovah. For Yahweh is the great God of Gods, Lord of the Elohim - (Deuteronomy 10 :17) Collect what belongs to truth, for truth is what the King says - (from Egyptian Pyramid Texts, 2348 BC)"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21 . Freud and the Jehovah Problem The significant genius of Freud's quest lies not only in the fact that it focused on proving the true identity of Moses, but that it questioned the likelihood of a once great priest of the sun and his followers becoming worshippers of a relatively unimportant regional volcano god. After all, this Yahweh was violent, jealous, and forever extolling his own v irtue and uniqueness. He would appear to be the last god that a civilized people would choose to revere and prostrate themselves before. Freud rightly sensed this and knew full well that Jehovah was but a minor god of mountains and volcanoes, worshipped by small numbers far outside the land of pyramids, sun temples, and complex pantheons. Jahve was certainly a volcano - god. As we know, however, Egypt has no volcanoes and the mountains of the Sinai Peninsula have never been volcanic; on the other hand volcano es which may have been active up to a late period are found along the western border of Arabia...The god Jahve...was probably in no way a remarkable being. A rude, narrow - minded local god, violent and blood - thirsty, he had promised his adherents to give th em \"a land flowing with milk and honey\" and he encouraged them to rid the country of its present inhabitants \"with the edge of a sword\" - Freud Jehovah was originally a god of the atmosphere. He manifested himself in the tempest; he unchained the waves of the sea; the wind has his breath; the thunder was his voice, the lightning his messenger. He filled the air with frost; he precipitated the hail; he blanketed the earth with snow; he deluged the land with rain; he congealed the water of the stream, and par ched the verdure of the field - John E. Remsberg ( The Christ ) Freud expressed amazement that so much detail on the reprehensible nature of this god should have been preserved. Perhaps he would have agreed with us that it was included and preserved, even af ter centuries of editing, because it served to obscure the god being worshipped by the Egyptian - born exiles, the entourage of Akhenaton - the real \"Moses.\" Jahve was undoubtedly a volcano - god. There was no reason for the inhabitants of Egypt to worship him - Freud The Messenger of Yahweh appeared to him as a Flame of Fire - (Exodus 3:2) The Lord your God is a consuming Fire...On Earth He let you see His Great Fire, and out of the Fire you heard His Word - (Deuteronomy 4:24 and 36)"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"There came thundering and lightening, and a cloud upon the mountain of God, and a great Voice like trumpets blasting, so that all the people in the camp trembled - (Exodus 19:16) In any case, Freud's words lead us to the heart of the Moses - Akhenaton problem. W e know that the god of the latter figure was Aton, god of light. This is the same god worshipped by the Israelites under the name Adon . But Adon was a name used in place of the word Jehovah . So Aton and Adon (or Aton and Jehovah) are one and the same being. Since this fact had to be concealed, the story of the volcano - god was concocted. Jehovah was to be met in lands distant from Egypt. He was to be encountered after the exodus and not before. Prior to the exodus only Moses himself would have been granted an audience and that, a gain, would have been during the time when he was an outcast in remote lands. Once we realize that Aton and Adon are the same deity and that they are Egyptian and not Arabian or Syrian, and that their priest was none other than Akhenaton, the expelled eigh teenth dynasty renegade pharaoh, the clouds of mystery evaporate and the truth stands illuminated. The realization assists us to understand the secret meaning of many biblical passages that have not been successfully explained even by the greatest scholars . There are many passages in the Old Testament that speak of semi - enlightened god - men, or god - kings, the leaders of the Israelites. Many of these passages, particularly those in Daniel and Isaiah, have been cunningly misinterpreted as predictions concerni ng Jesus who was to appear seven centuries later in history. This nonsense has been widely accepted on faith by the majority of churchmen and evangelists. However, these mysterious passages relate not to future prophets and leaders but to contemporary ones who descended from royal Atonist houses. The character known as Moses was one such super - human entity. Even though it is now known that this Moses did not write the books attributed to him he is still considered a legitimate historical character. W e submi t, however, that he was none other than Akhenaton himself or, at least, one of his royal pharaonic Atonist successors. Once we learn to read biblical passages correctly, we will be bound to accept this thesis and realize the reasons for the all too conspic uous righteous arrogance of the chief, yet elusive, protagonists mentioned therein. Now Moses called all Israel and said to them: ―You have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land - the great trials which your eyes have seen, the signs, and those great wonders...And I (Moses) have led you forty years in the wilderness... that you may know that I am the LORD your God\" - (Deuteronomy 29:2 - 6) Now see that I, even I, am He, And there is no God besides Me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; Nor is there any who can deliver from My hand.

On the contrary they are those of a physical being. The \"I\" speaking is not god but Moses or - more correctly - Akhenaton : I am the Lord God who brought you out o f Egypt...you shall have no other god except me - (Exodus 19:25, 20:3) I dwell among the children of Israel, and am their God - (Exodus 29:45) Cry out and shout for joy, you inhabitants of Zion, for great is He who is among you - the Holy One of Israel - ( Isaiah 12:6) I was there, ready to be approached by a people who did not ask, ready to be found by them who did not seek Me. I said: 'Here I Am, Here I AM,' to a nation that did not invoke My Name. All day I stretched out My hands to a rebellious people wh o pursued evil, and choose their own ways; a people who provoked Me continually to My face - (Isaiah 65:1 - 3) For I am God, no ordinary man, but the Holy One, in your midst - (Hosea 11:9) Joshua said to the children of Israel \"Come close and hear the Word o f Yahweh your God; thus you will know that a living god is among you\" - (Joshua 3: 9 - 10) Behold! The Lord comes forth from His Holy dwelling; He comes down to walk upon the heights of the Earth - (Micah 1:3) The King of Israel, Yahweh Himself, is in your m idst - (Zechariah 3:15) The origins of Judeo - Christianity are to be found in Egypt. They derive from a specific time and place and, despite the distortions and false leads, men such as Freud expertly uncovered the truth. There was no reason for Egyptians t o worship any unimportant volcano - god but every reason for them to be reverent toward the auspicious god of their reigning potentates and leaders, worshipped for centuries in their greatest cities and temples. In the Bible the Israelite god Yahweh is somet imes referred to as Adon, though the term is used as a title, not as the personal name of Yahweh. Eventually, the appellation \"Adonai\" (my Lord) became a substitution name for pronouncing in prayer the unutterable name Yahweh, which by the early rabbinical period (first and second centuries A.D.) had become too sacred to pronounce. To this day, when Jews encounter the consonants of \"Yahweh' (YHWH) in prayer, they pronounce it \"Adonai.\""},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"They might be shocked to learn that this substitution word is related to the Phoenician \"Adon\" and the Greek Cypriot \"Adonis\" - (Phoenicia.org) Freud was not worried about Jewish reaction toward his revisionist tendencies and expose, although he was begged by at least one rabbi (Abraham S.

He spoke and wrote of his relief at being re - situated in London where he could more freely express his radica l ideas on the subject of religion. And we cannot fault his intuition or his fears in this regard. W e would have to revise our understanding of his intellectual prowess if he had failed to identify the enemies of truth, those descendants of the very theocr acies whose origin and destiny he so expertly exposed during the final years of his life. In Moses and Monotheism the master of the human mind expresses in exceptionally clear and direct language who his enemies were and why they were disposed to resent hi m and his work: The Catholic church, which so far has been the implacable enemy of all freedom of thought and has resolutely opposed any idea of this world being governed by advance toward the recognition of truth...Psychoanalytic research is in any case t he subject of suspicious attention from Catholicism. I do not maintain that this suspicion is unmerited. If our research leads us to a result that reduces religion to the status of a neurosis of mankind and explains its grandiose powers in the same way as we should a neurotic obsession in our individual patients, then we may be sure we shall incur in this country the greatest resentment of the powers that be...violent methods of suppression are by no means alien to the Catholic church - Sigmund Freud ( Moses and Monotheism ) A key observation of Freud's, that has been noticed by many scholars, concerns the amount of writings and deeds attributed to Moses, most of which he could not have composed or committed. W as this just an obsession of later writers, a kind of creative license that infected them? Or was it done because the writers were aware of whom it was they were really exalting? W ho was the character behind the fictional Moses that merited such reverence and to have inspired commentators to ascribe works to him hundreds of years after he had departed the Earth?

The Jesus of the epistles is not spoken of as a man who had recently lived...Thus, we are left with an entire corpus of early Christian correspondence which gives us no in dication that the divine Christ these writers look to for salvation is to be identified with the man Jesus of Nazareth whom the Gospels place in the early first century - Earl Doherty ( The Jesus Puzzle ) W e are now sixty - seven years on from the death of Sig mund Freud and we feel that the time has finally come when scholars and researchers can declare, with confidence and authority, that the Jesus depicted in the New Testament did not exist as a physical presence in the world. Search as they might the biblic ists have not found the appropriate evidence to support a real man, a carpenter's son, who was also savior of the world. Every major find further decimates the theory of a Jesus of Nazareth put before us in the New Testament.

Nowhere in their many works do we find mention of a coming Jesus Christ. Additionally, there is no mention of a great Messianic tradition among the \" Jews.\" Another Messianic figure of importance was Menahem the Essene. Descriptions of this prophet, whose name meant \"Comforter,\" indicate that he was certainly an important character. According to Josephus, he was honored by Herod, the Rome - backed King o f Judea installed in the year 19 BC: There was a certain Essene named Menahem, whose virtue was attested in his whole conduct of life and especially in his having from God a foreknowledge of the future...At the moment Herod paid very little attention to hi s words, for he was quite lacking in such hopes, but after gradually being advanced to kingship and good fortune, when he was at the height of his power, he sent for Menahem and questioned him about the length of time he would reign...Herod...was satisfied even with this answer and dismissed Menahem with a friendly gesture. And from that time on he continued to hold all Essenes in honour. Now we have seen fit to report these things to our readers, however incredible they may seem, and to reveal what has tak en place among us because many of these men have indeed been vouchsafed a knowledge of divine things because of their virtue - Josephus ( Jewish Antiquities 15.372 – 79) Herod, who had driven the Hasmoneans from office, respected the Essenes and especially th eir leader, Menahem - Israel Knohl and David Maisel ( The Messiah before Jesus ) ...Jesus' messianic vocation bears the imprint of Menahem's messianism - ibid Rabbinical tradition considered the Messiah's name to be Menahem, while the gospel's \"Paraclete\" or \"Comforter,\" to be sent by Jesus after his death (John 14:16) fits the character of this Essenian Messiah. The Rabbinical tradition holds that Menahem lived before Jesus not after him and that Jesus was himself carrying on the work of his predecessor. Ind eed, Jesus spoke to his disciples of the coming Paraclete during the last supper at Mount Zion, the place were Menahem had lived and taught. It was a ruse of the gospel writers to have Menahem come after Jesus. In our mind there is no more evidence for a l iving Menahem than for a Jesus. One is undoubtedly as fictional a character as the other. The name Menahem meaning \"Comforter,\" is probably a variant of Amenahem , after Amen, the Egyptian god of light. Like Jesus, Menahem was one sent by the \"most high.\" "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" Emperor Tiberius - (Tiberius Claudius Nero, 42 - 16 BC), Believed by author Tony Bushby to be the father of the biblical Jesus by way of Mary who lived in Rome, This would make Jesus a member of the powerful Claudian family of Rome. Such a man could conceivably commission historians such as Paul to pen whatever he demanded. Author Tony Bushby, primarily working from rather spurious and convoluted Jewish sources such as the Talmud and Toldoth Jeshu or \"Life of Jesus,\" is convinced that Paul‟s hero is based on a legitimate historical rebel leader known as Judas Khrestus and on his twin Yeshua Ben Panthera. This is the name used for Jesus Christ in the Rabbinical literature and tradition. In Bushby‟s estimation Paul‟s hero is a fusion of these twins; one a rather Messianic loud - mouthed rebel, the other a gentler and more forg iving sort. Neither of these personages had a carpenter called Joseph for a father. Joseph, himself a priest, was a guardian to the boys when they were in the care of the Essenes, the strange extremist sect that chose to live a strict monastic life while t hey awaited the return of their deliverer - the “Teacher of Righteousness.” Bushby finds that Mary, the mother of the twins, was a member of the infamous but super - wealthy and influential Herod family who ruled Judea at the behest of the Roman emperor. The Herod family, which owned estates in both Rome and France, had little in common with the Judeans under their rule. Bushby claims that Mary (called \"Mary Stadea\" in the Rabbinical tradition) was good friends with the Roman Emperor Augustus. Her family prob ably came from the ancient city of Petra since her mother, Bernice, was a Nabotean of Arabic stock. Interestingly, for our thesis, the ancestors of Mary were Benjaminite priest kings of the House of Judah (Aton). Mary‟s mother Bernice was the sister of Sal ome who appears as an important character in the story of John the Baptist. Bushby goes on to state that the father of the twin boys was none other than the Emperor Tiberius who forced his attentions on Mary when she lived in Rome. This would explain the m any traditions that deem Jesus to have been illegitimate."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The conclusion dr awn is that by reason of her mother‘s friendship with Emperor Augustus, the teenage Mariamne Herod met Tiberius when he returned to Rome to see his emperor father early in 9 BC, and her twin sons were conceived by rape or adultery by him at the time. It wa s possible Mariamne Herod was then married, for the traditions of the time accepted the early marriage of young girls...Mariamne Herod named her sons Yeshua and Judas and the populace subsequently nicknamed them ̳ben Panthera‘ (son of Panthera) after their ̳ adulterer‘ father. The name Yeshu‘a came to be pronounced and spoken as Jesus in English language translations - Tony Bushby ( The Bible Fraud ) The Gospel appellations, ̳king of the Jews‘ and ̳Son of god‘ were correct titles because of the tradition of the times and the identity of both the mother and father. The boys were ̳brought up by the Augustus Caesar,‘ their grandfather, and at least one of the boys publicly called himself the ̳son of God,‘ and ̳Son of the archangel.‘ This he could legally do for he t ruly was the ̳son of God‘ in the Caesar family tradition - ibid Bushby rightly draws our attention to the significance of the term Panthera . It specifically refers to the panther, and to the garb worn by priests of the sun temple of Egypt. The panther was, like the lion, a symbol of initiation into the Hermetic mysteries. And most significantly, the term appears to derive directly from the Egyptian Pan Neter Ra, a title meaning “Son of Ra” (Son of the Sun). So, if we are to believe the latest evidence, the physical Jesus was not the son of god, as Christians and Jews may or may not accept, but the descendant of Roman emperors and heir to their throne. Mary... \"was the descendant of princes and rulers\" - (The Talmud, b. Sanh., 106a) Jesus the Nazarene, who pr acticed magic in Egypt - (The Hebrew Talmud, b. Sanh, 107b) The naming of Jesus as \"the son of Pandira\" also points to his having been an Egyptian king - Ahmed Osman The personality of Jesus Christ, as known to modern Christians, is based on several Messia nic rebel figures of the ―Holy Land,‖ but particularly on Simon Magus, Judas the Galilean, and Yeshua Ben Panthera, none of whom had anything to do with literally being from God - Tony Bushby ( The Bible Fraud ) In this case, the Roman Jesus would have been so powerful that he or his descendants could quite easily have determined what a scribe such as Paul revealed in writing about him. If Paul was taking his orders from members of the bloodline of Jesus ben Panthera (the Egyptian sun priest) he would have a reason for exonerating Rome and condemning the hardline Pharisaic Jews. If Paul‟s “Road to Damascus” conversion tale was the fictive cover for his personal connection to a living Jesus, we can understand why he was so motivated in his work of creating a ne w religion which chose to deny any Judaic roots.

If we had to rely on letters of the earliest Christians, such as Paul and those who w rote most of the other New Testament epistles, we would be hard pressed to find anything resembling the details of the Gospel story. If we did not read Gospel associations into what Paul and the others say about their Christ Jesus, we could not even tell t hat this figure, the object of their worship, was a man who had recently lived in Palestine and had been executed by the Roman authorities with the help of a hostile Jewish establishment - Earl Doherty ( The Jesus Puzzle ) The duplicity and scheming of Paul is apparent from his own words: To Jews I became as a Jew, to win Jews; as they are subjects to the law of Moses, I put myself under that law to win them, although I am not myself subject to it. To win Gentiles, who are outside the Law, I made myself like one of them, although I am not in truth outside God‘s law, being under the law of Christ. To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. Indeed, I have become everything in turn to men of every sort, so that in one way or another I may save some - (Corinthian s 9:20 - 22) I am an Israelite by race, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born and bred; in my attitude to the law, a Pharisee - (from Romans 11:2 and Philippians 3:5 ) His claim to be still a Pharisee was simply a lie, and if his real views had been known, the Pharisees would certainly not have supported - Hyam Maccoby ( Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity ) ...If Saul was employed by the High Priest to arrest people and imprison...it can only mean one thing: that Saul was a member of the High Prie st‘s police force and his job was to arrest anyone who constituted a threat to the occupations. The last person who would be employed by the High Priest would be a Pharisee, ergo, Saul was not a Pharisee - ibid From the very beginning, his apparent wealth, his Roman citizenship and his easy familiarity with the presiding establishment have differentiated him from his fellows and from other members of the 'early Church.' Obviously, he has influential connections with the ruling elite.

Undoubtedly, the animistic drives within human beings are appeased by the content of the tales. The identification with the idealized figure gives comfort, an d the notion that someone else has died for one's own sins is surely a major factor enhancing conviction. The bizarrity is increased when we discover how many \"career\" clerics, bishops, and priests have dismissed the historicity of Jesus, the man they are meant to be administering for. The quorum responsible for the rise of \"Judaism\" are also responsible for the rise of Christianity. The supposed differences between the two religions, and the schisms between them (like those between Catholicism and Protesta ntism), have been craftily concocted to conceal this fact. Their differences and their supposed enmity are, for the most part, merely camouflage concealing their closeness and true histories. When \"Judaism,\" as it was in times past, ceased to fully serve t he secret purposes of its creators, living it up in affluent Rome, a new religion was commissioned to better serve their temperaments and private agendas. Judaism was not to fade. It was to be renovated and transformed. The Pharisaic interpretation was to be scaled back and Paul, friend of the Sadducees and Romans, would rescript the archaic traditions into something modern that served to mollify their pagan hosts while empowering the Levitical elites seeking new empires in the W estern lands. Paul would be the man to tear the tapestry of Judaism into two parts. The separation of the tapestry, so to speak, allowed Paul to stitch into his Christian half the Atonist threads that had faded and broken in the Judaic half. Atonism was to be the world's new religion . It had been the father of all religions and it was to rule again albeit under a cloak. Like an imperious school master overseeing first grade pupils Paul was to take in hand all the renegade little cults, sects, and pretender factions that had strayed to o far from the original pristine interpretation. Like so many irascible wayward children, the world's masses had been running amok without a father to guide their energies. As a result they had been getting up to all kinds of ideological mischief.

Paul understood what his masters understood. The Pharisaic tradition h ad arisen as a branch of the trunk of Atonism. It began in Heliopolis, Avaris, and Amarna, and matured and solidified in Tanis, Jerusalem, and Babylon. The Israelites were a powerful nobility of Egypt and not vagabonds wandering around seeking for a home. Their religion was not fringe or obscure. It was conceived in the sun temples of the Nile. It was fine that the world remained ignorant of this. The elites with intelligence knew it, and that was enough. Judaism had arisen from Atonism and another branch w ould develop from the same trunk. That branch was Christianity . Paul of Tarsus, whom Ralph Ellis believes was none other than Josephus Flavius Piso (the historian), was hard at work doing the bidding of his imperious masters. His signature would appear on the canvas of this new piece of artwork but he was supplied the colors, canvas, and brushes by others. He executed his appointed task with zeal and commitment. His attempts to divorce his new religion from its Judaic roots were commendably brilliant even i f they ultimately failed to do the trick. The Apostolic Council held in Jerusalem...the year 49 AD, officially declared the complete independence of Christianity from Judaism. And yet twenty years later...the Judeo - Christians or Ebionites, on friendly term s with the Jewish Talmudists, introduced into the New Testament the messiah doctrine of the Jews, and also the prophecies alleged to have foreshadowed the coming of their messiah - Jacob Elon Conner ( Christ Was Not a Jew ) ...as Qumran research has matured, it has been widely recognized that, although there were major differences between Qumran literature and early Christian literature and between the Qumran community and the early Christian community, nevertheless, they were also remarkably similar in theol ogical vocabulary, in some major doctrinal tenets, and in several organizational and ritual practices - Hershel Shanks ( Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls ) One of the best ways of beginning to think about the nature of Christianity is to think of it in the light of Judaism. Today, we so often think of Judaism and Christianity as two distinct religions...But early Christianity never saw itself in that way. The earliest Christians saw themselves as faithful Jews simply following Jewish teachings. In fact, the first main dispute in the Christian church was whether non - Jews, the Gentiles, could ever be part of Christianity...So when we start thinking about Christianity, we have to understand its very Jewish roots...Christianity's Jewishness is very pervasive ind eed - Rev. Douglas Jones ( Why? and What? - A Brief Introduction to Christianity ) "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Behind the official form of Judaism lay the secret Mosaic (Atonist) doctrine transmitted to an elect group of mysterious Levites who had followed Moses out of Egypt across th e desert to Mount Sinai and who had not assimilated into the W estern lands after the periods of alleged captivity. This famous “oral tradition” is believed to have been finally set down in writing in 200 AD. It is the content of the tome known as the Babyl onian Talmud that contains the Mishnah and the Gemara. The official Mosaic dogma was the torah (the Hebrew Pentateuch) that became the first five books of the bible ( Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy ). Jews do not recognize the New Testa ment and do not consider the Old Testament a Christian book. A rabbi was considered a living embodiment of the scriptures, not only of the official torah but more importantly of the secret oral tradition never to be communicated to the common Jew and that was the province of a small fanatical elect group that considered themselves set apart, namely, the Levitical Gaonim . Their comprehension and embodiment of the scriptures, together with their ability to interpret the will of god, enabled their underlings t o be saved. These saviors did not need to recognize a Christ - like being so beloved of Christians. They considered themselves the light, the truth, and the way for their people. They considered themselves sole possessors of heavenly keys. The two crossed keys of Vatican City.

Pope's bear the title \"Servant of the Servants of God\" Among the greatest riddles of Jewish prehistoric times is that concerning the antecedents of the Levites. They are said to have been derived from one of the twelve tribes of Israel, the tribe of Levi, but no tradition has ever ventured to pronounce on where that tribe originally dwelt or what portion of the conquered country of Canaan had been allotted to it. They occupied the most impo rtant priestly positions, but yet they were distinguished from the priests. A Levite is not necessarily a priest: it is not the name of a caste - Sigmund Freud ( Moses and Monotheism ) One hundred years following the sacking and seizure of Israel, the Levite s composed their ―Law,‖ epitomized in Deuteronomy which was read aloud in the temple. This was"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"the birth of ―Mosaic Law‖ really created by the Levites and attributed to Moses. It is really Levitical or Judaic law.

The reason was that the Jews of the Diaspora had been losing their native tongue. The elders could not foresee that Christianity would later arise and bring their ―Scriptures‖ into greater exposure. If they had known this, the tra nslation would never have been made - ibid Judaism in all its modern manifestations ultimately derives from rabbinic Judaism, the religious system of the rabbis of the Mishnah (compiled in about 200 CE) and the Talmud (compiled between 400 and 600 CE). Fir st codified in the Mishnah, rabbinic tradition claims to be the continuation of the teachings of the Pharisees, a group of lay teachers of the Torah who arose in the years following the Maccabean uprising (168 - 164 BCE) and who continued teaching up to the time of the Roman destruction of the Temple in 70 CE - Hershel Shanks ( Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls ) Being a conspicuously pagan doctrine, the idea of a single supernatural \"Christ\" was largely an anathema to the elite rabbis. If he had purpose it wa s as a monarch and political leader descended from King David and House of Judah (Aton). In this guise, he was awaited by most of the lower class in Judea and by the fanatically anti - Roman zealots, the Sicarii. The Messiah of the zealot groups was, however , anything but a loving and peaceful god - man. From early versions of the Old Testament (and Dead Sea Scrolls) we read of the conquering and defiant Messianic figure so attractive to those attempting to rid themselves of foreign pagan powers: How lovely is this king Messiah, who is to rise from the house of Judah. He girds his loins and goes out to wage war on those who hate him, killing kings and rulers...and reddening the mountains with the blood of their slain. With his garments dripping in blood, he is l ike one who treads grapes in the wine press. The awaited Messiah was no longer the Redeemer of original sin, a spiritual victor who would lead the world, it was a temporal king, bloody with battle, who would make Israel master of the world, and \"drag all p eoples under the wheels of his chariot\" - Lady Queensborough ( Occult Theocracy ) Yes, this is clearly an entity in line with the Mosaic (Atonist) Jehovah. He's a far cry from the gentle forgiving Jesus presented by Paul. Paul was basing his Christ only slig htly on such a rapacious character and much more on pagan deities familiar to W estern Gentiles. His Christ was compassionate, tolerant, and loving of all men, someone who gave up his own life for the good of all.

Those who have happy homes in this world do no t devote themselves to the veneration of aggressive Messianic kings. A part of Paul's job was to take this time hardened tradition and soften it up. It was vital the Messianic figure was seen to have spiritual powers only, and not be considered a political threat. The Gospel according to Matthew presents Jesus as the consummation of Mosaic religion and as the Messiah announced by the prophets. Luke is mainly directed towards Greeks and Romans, and depicts Jesus not as a national messiah but rather as savior of the world - Gruber and Kersten ( The Original Jesus ) ...the title ―Messiah‖ carried no connotation of deity or divinity. The word ―Messiah‖ means ―anointed one‖ and it is a title of kingship; every Jewish king of the Davidic line had this title - Hyam M accoby ( Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity ) ...the Messiah, in the pre - Pauline movement was the King of the Jews and therefore not directly relevant to Gentiles. The Messiah was the human descendant of King David, who would restore Jewish mona rchy and Jewish national independence. He would not reign over the whole world - ibid It was by the ingenuity of Paul that this improbable Judaic \"Messiah\" was re - scripted and upgraded into an attractive and dynamic figure with a unique spiritual message o penly contradicting the rabbinical tradition and offering a revolutionary path to salvation. A weak renegade who was an anathema to Jewish hardliners could quite easily be transmogrified into something suitable for a different audience. He could have trait s of every god - man, sun king, and solar hero that had ever edified the human imagination. And he could be a representative of someone very special, someone who was not meant to be openly known, whose bloodline had continued to influence the world from the Mosaic age and who had ingratiated the highest echelons of imperial Rome, whose empire stretched across the known world. As an agent of this secret dynastic power, Paul was to artificially create a rift between the old tradition and his new one so that one could be played against the other for as long as need be. Through his artifice the divide would be drastic and long lasting. It was important, therefore, that his Messiah's message was seen to be rejected by recalcitrant and quarrelsome Jews. It was impor tant that his savior of all mankind be put to death by the Jewish Sanhedrin of Pharisees and Sadducees and not by Rome. His tradition would acknowledge no direct connection to the Rabbinical tradition of ancient times. Ultimately, Paul's treatment would de nigrate the Jews and cause men to accuse them of deicide. Moreover, such egregious tactics would compel the vast majority of Jews to reject the \"Rome - friendly\" solar hero of the New Testament. This rejection of"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"the Pauline Christ was the perfect smokescree n obscuring the dark and remote origins of both religions. According to Judaic and Christian sources, the original followers of Jesus were not called \"Christians.\" They were referred to as \"Nasoreans,\" or \"Nazarenes\" (from Notzrim ). This is confirmed by Cl ement, Origen, St. Jerome, and other historians. If Roman or other historians had then been writing true and accurate accounts of Jesus they would have been chronicling and recording this term and not that of \"Christian,\" that is used but four times in the New Testament. The reason why this proper name was not used probably has to do with the fact that the Nazarenes were known to have existed over 150 years prior to the birth of the New Testament Jesus. This predicament was not a problem to the Essences and Gnostics who accepted that Jesus, the \"Nasorean,\" had lived years before the bible's nativity. For Christians, however, the predicament was seriously threatening since it hearkened back to a time when their Jesus was considered a heretical self - serving co rruptor of truth rather than a champion of it. For this reason the term \"Nazarene\" was misapplied to mean the place of Jesus' birth and the term \"Christian\" was adopted to distinguish his followers. Factually, the term Nasorean, that means \"to be separate, \" was used to describe the priests and members of the Gnostic Mandeans who repudiated the teachings of Jesus in favor of those of John the Baptist. Jesus had, they believed, been a disciple of John but had corrupted his teachings. The term Nasorean had to be mistranslated since the Church knew that it originally referred to cults with connections to Egypt whose teachings contradicted the Christian Gospels and whose leaders came from a spiritual lineage going back to distant ages. Most importantly, the Mande an church and its teachings clearly evidenced the direct connections between proto - Christianity and Egyptian stellar and solar theology. And it was this relationship that threatened Paul and his masters. The story of the Baptist and his Gnostic Church was modified and skewed into the shape found in the New Testament that presents John as a rather eccentric skin - wearing old world prophet content to baptize and laud Jesus and tell his own disciples and the rest of the world to follow him alone. In truth, the successor of John the Baptist, the Mandean \"King of Light,\" was the Gentile prophet Simon Magus who cryptically turns up in the Christian New Testament as Simon the Zealot, Simon Cananaios, and Lazarus of Bethany. The cults of John and Simon are believed t o have carried on in secret through many Gnostic sects and orders, particularly the Knights Templar, Knights of St. John, and powerful Order of Sion (whose chiefs are entitled \"John\" or \"Jean\"). The Church of Rome considers the John cults heretical and eve n satanic since they condemn the Pauline Jesus as an imposter and opportunist.

They were called the Nazarenes, and in all their beliefs they were indistinguishable from the Pharisees, except that they believed in the resurrection of Jesus, and that Jesus was still the promised Messiah. They did not believe that Jesus was a divine person, but that, by a miracle of God, he had been brought back to life after his death on the cross, and would soon come back to complete his mission of overthrowing the Romans and setting up a Messianic kingdom...Having known Jesus personally, they were aware that he had observed the Jewish religious law all his life and had never rebelled against it...The Nazarenes were themselves very observant of Jewish law...The Nazarenes did not regard themselves as belonging to a new religion - Hyam Macoby ( Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity ) Paul and his Levitical (Atonist) backers could easily decide to implicate ordinary \"Jews\" in the murder of Jesus and to lay the blame for his death upon their heads. The Levites and Gaonim were of the House of Judah (Yahud) and not Israel. As we will see, the majo rity of those \"Israelite\" tribes that had left Egypt had chosen not to follow Akhenaton and his extremist Atonist priests. They went their own way after rejecting the agendas of the megalomaniacal Levites and their obsessed leader. As a result of their bla sphemy they and their descendants were considered degenerate outcasts by the elite Atonists. In their minds, the Levites were true \"Jews\" and not the renegades who chose to disperse and assimilate into the W est. The two tribes of Levites, under Akhenaton, would see to it that the \"Children of Israel\" would be banished in the sight of their Lord, condemned and considered \"lost tribes.\" Putting the blame upon them for the death of Jesus satisfied a long held desire of the Levitical priests. It was the price t hey had to pay for their disobedience and self will. Paul could appear to demonize Jews and push Christians away from the Judaism that was put before them. But he knew that the Christians who felt repulsed by hardline Pharisaic Judaism were unconsciously i dentifying with Levitical Atonist Judaism.

Their Zionism is not Jewish but Egyptian. Its Atonism plain and simple. The Gospels portray the Pharisees as the chief opponents of Jesus, criticizing him for curing people on the Sabbath, and even plotting to kill him because of these cures. T he Gospels also represent Jesus as criticizing the Pharisees most strongly, calling them hypocrites and oppressors - Hyam Maccoby ( Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity ) ...He was wont to go to the Synagogue on the Sabbath; and He enjoined the healed leper to do what Moses commanded in the matter of his healing...Respectable people were scandalized by the freedom and familiarity of His intercourse with the disreputable. He was nicknamed 'Friend of publicans and sinners...The rank and file of the Jewish nation were estranged in the end by His lack of patriotism - Andrew M. Greeley ( The Jesus Myth, 1971 ) Responding in kind, the hardliners of the Nazarene Church, as well as members of other breakaway sects, looked upon Paul with utter contempt. They considered him a blatant forger and plagiarist who was deliberately misconstruing their sacred traditions. In the Dead Sea Scrolls, although the connection is never lucidly made, Paul is certainly the one being described as the \"W icked Priest\" who threate ns the life of John the Baptist, the \"Teacher of Righteousness.\" The Essenes and their kind would not have taken Paul or his Jesus to their hearts. And as several biblical historians specializing in sects such as those at Qumran have stated, it is not very likely that Jesus (if he did exist historically) was a member or associate of these groups. After all, the Jesus of the bible did partake in rites at the Jerusalem Temple and did not appear to be the ardent rebellious Messiah awaited by extremists. In fac t, as we read in the Book of Matthew , he wished his Messiahship to be kept strictly secret and refrained from openly proclaiming it. In his pamphlet on the Essenes, biblical historian, Ethelbert Stauffer, pointed out nine major discrepancies adding that in his opinion these Essenic groups would have had as many reasons to ostracize or even murder Jesus as did Herod, the Romans, or the Jerusalem Temple authorities. The reasons are laid out in his book Jesus and the Wilderness Community at Qumran : The Qumran community was heavily clerical; priests played a larger role there than in any other Jewish community of that time. But in the life and ministry of Jesus there is no reference to the priestly tradition."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"The wilderness community was almost compulsively comm itted to ritualism.

The Qumran sect was deeply involved in revolutionary militarism. Jesus argued that all that take the sword shall perish by the sword. The Qumran community was obsessed with the minor details of the Jewish calendar. Jesus completely ignored the calen dar controversies. The wilderness community was committed to secret teachings and traditions. Jesus, on the contrary, insisted that he had spoken publicly for months and years and had said nothing in secret. The Qumran community expected two messiahs: the kingly one from the house of David; the priestly one from the house of Aaron. Jesus, on the contrary, is completely unconcerned about genealogies and not very much occupied with messianic questions. The Qumran sect was intentionally critical of Jerusalem p riesthood and the Temple cult, claiming that it was illegitimate, deviant from the proper hereditary line of the priesthood. Jesus, on the contrary, took part in the Temple celebration and, while he was critical of the abuses, made no comment at all on the question of priestly genealogy. Yes, the Pauline Christ would have been quite a strange bird to the Jews who were awaiting their avenging and wrathful Messiah. Peace, tolerance, and brotherly love were not on the minds of those extremists who followed a r igorous acetic life in barren outlying areas, who deified John the Baptist (who had condemned the Jerusalem Temple, the Herodian puppets, and Roman invaders), and who believed their paradise to be an Earthly one free of political oppressors and tyrants.

Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots eagerly awaited a better world, whether it be messianic or apocalyptic; and Jesus satisfied none of them. The Pharisees were appalled at his casual disregard of the law and his v igorous condemnation of their moral self - righteousness. The Zealots could find in his preaching no promise of success in political revolutions. The Essenes were undoubtedly horrified by his proclamation of a kingdom for all men. Those who expected a politi cal messiah were disillusioned when Jesus refused the claim that he was such a messiah and would have no part of the schemes to make him king. And finally, those who expected an eschatological apocalypse were told that they would see no signs from heaven a nd that they would hear from Jesus no guess as to when the last days would be fulfilled. In other words, Jesus rejected the titles, the categories, the theories, and the aspirations of all religious movements of his time. He did preach a kingdom, but it wa s a kingdom not of this world - ibid ...the Qumran writings have no literary parallel to the synoptic Gospels, nor do the Essenes seem to have shown any interest in recording events in such narrative form. For them the experience of their forefathers chronic led in the Bible was all the history they needed; their own situation was but a repetition of what had gone before - R. Joseph Hoffmann ( Jesus in History and Myth ) On the face of it, Paul‘s doctrine of Jesus is a daring form of Judaism. Paul was advocating a doctrine that seemed to have far more in common with pagan myths than with Judaism: that Jesus was a divine - human person who had descended to Earth from the heavens and experienced death for the express purpose of saving mankind. The very fact that the Jews found this doctrine new and shocking shows that it plays no role in the Jewish scripture - Hyam Maccoby ( Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity ) Isaiah was the first Israelite prophet to present the Suffering Servant (Christ) as the divinel y appointed Savior.

Paul and the Solar Theocracy If Paul had liv ed today, he might have ended up on a psychiatrist‘s couch. Throughout his life he was overwhelmed with an all - pervasive sense of guilt which pursued him with relentless fury. From early paintings and from descriptions in the New Testament accounts, both h is and others, we have a rather repellent physical portrait of him. Ernest Renan characterized him as ―the ugly little Jew.‖ Paul was of slight stature, bowlegged, blind in one eye, and probably had some deformity of body. He was given to recurrent attacks of malaria, had repeated hallucinations, and some scholars believe he was subject to epileptic seizures. He was celibate, exhorted others to celibacy, and advocated marriage only in extreme circumstances - Max Dimont (Jews, God and History ) What we know o f the life of Jesus comes primarily from the four Gospels and from the many works of St. Paul. Although there is considerable dispute over authenticity, Paul's officially accepted contributions to the traditional biblical corpus are the following: Acts of the Apostles (Book of Acts) Romans First Corinthians Second Corinthians Galatians Ephesians Philippians Colossians First Thessalonians Second Thessalonians First Timothy Second Timothy Titus Philemon Hebrews Contrary to what we are compelled to believe, ho wever, the roots of Christianity do not originate in Paul's encounter with a preternatural voice and light whilst on the road to Damascus. This tall - tale of his concoction is not where we are to look for the truth. Paul's \"Christ\" was based on innumerable pagan deities and his Christianity is patently Egyptian in origin. Paul was more than familiar with pagan traditions. His Christ and the man Jesus are two different entities. A close reading of the Epistles and the four Gospels reveals this. Indeed, after such an examination we find that the being that Paul refers"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"to as \"Christ\" or \"Son of God\" has little to do with any incarnated carpenter's son inhabiting a physical plane of existence. Author Earl Doherty clarifies the bluff that has duped the world for s o long: Throughout his letters, Paul has much to say about faith. Faith in Jesus as the avenue to eternal life...But he leaves out what is surely the most important faith of all, the one that comes first, without which none of the others come into play. Pa ul ignores the requirement that one must have faith that the man Jesus had been the incarnation of the divine, redeeming Son he is preaching...These and similar passages in the epistles illustrate the orientation of early Christian thinking. They start wit h the divine Christ and detail his activities. They do not start with the human man and identify their divine Christ with him - ( The Jesus Puzzle ) The fusion of a divine pagan solar king and a living personality of humble birth (who may or may not have exi sted) occurred because Paul and his shadowy Roman backers wanted to furnish the world, especially the W estern world, with an attractive new religion complete with a mysterious and magnanimous god - man. The Christianity of Paul and his masters was, and is, a cover for their ancient Luciferianism. To make it somewhat acceptable to the many factions, aspects of their philosophies were adapted and added. Men could argue interminably about the nuances of the new religion. They could war intellectually for as long as they desired. Anything so that the real war against mankind, the real campaign of domination, could progress unmolested. The vast majority of uninformed and illiterate \"Jews\" had little time for Paul's concoction. His rescripting of their Messianic her o was not edifying to them. They held fast to the original lie, also concocted by the Atonists in ages past, that made Joshua, John, Jesus, Judas, or any Messianic character, into a political rebel king of Davidic bloodline come to free them from oppressio n. Such an empowered man would come to accuse and eradicate the evil Roman invaders. His job was not to take them to heaven. Observance of the Torah, and a life of morality, precipitated that eventuality. Yet, even among Judaic sects there was little agree ment or camaraderie. Indeed, there was intense hatred and antipathy of belief. To James (the Just) and Peter, and those who allegedly knew Jesus, the Temple at Jerusalem, and its priesthood, was an obscenity. The disciples of Jesus were, according to Jewis h historians, members of the Pharisaic tradition and as such they would have despised the elitist Sadducees whom they regarded as compliant puppets of the Roman invaders. The Nazarene Church of Pharisees (that came into existence in the latter half of the second century AD) that awaited the coming of the rebel Messiah, stood in strong opposition to the foreign pagan Gentiles. To hardcore Jews these Romans and their Sadducee (and Herodian) lieutenants were emissaries of Satan. Anyone supporting them, or advo cating compromise, was a \"Devil's Advocate\" - a foul betrayer of the Torah.

Romans, Herodians, Sadducees ...there is evidence, taken to be incontrovertible, that Paul‘s father was a wealthy man: this is that he was both a Roman citizen and a citizen of Tarsus. Undoubtedly, Paul is represented as claiming that not only he, but his father too, were Roman citizens (See Acts 22:28) - Hyam Maccoby Before his remarkable and suitably dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus, Paul was suggestively named Saul (Sol). Before he worked for the \"the Lord\" saving souls he worked for the High Priest of the Temple of Jerusalem. He was a police agent hunting and persecuting Christians. The High Priest was a member of the powerful Sadducee Party. ...we can see that many of the religious ideas and movements in Jesus' time have their coun terpart in our own day. The Sadducees, the corrupt, politically minded heirs of the ancient church, were an Establishment. The Pharisees were liberal reformers filled with self - righteousness and zeal. The Essenes were perfectionists, who had withdrawn from a corrupt society to build the new and more perfect world of their own. The Zealots were revolutionaries who believed that drastic political action would provide salvation from the injustices they saw all around - Andrew M. Greeley ( The Jesus Myth, 1971 ) In the time of Jesus, the imperial structure consisted of the emperor who appointed the procurator who in turn appointed the high priest whose legitimacy was grounded neither in the written nor in the oral law, but in the Roman imperium. Finally, a Sanhedr in or privy council was appointed by the high priest. Its legitimacy, like that of the high priest's, was political, not religious - R. Joseph Hoffmann ( Jesus in History and Myth ) The relationship between the Sadducee Party and Roman authorities requires f urther exploration and is, in our opinion, a key factor behind the re - casting of the Jewish Messianic figure into the Jesus Christ figure so beloved of the Christians and so soft on the Romans. It is our personal belief that a relationship existed between Roman and Sadducee elites and that these two forces conspired together, for reasons of financial gain and territorial power, to invent the Christ myth. The historian Edward Gibbon ( Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire ) made it clear just how powerful the \"Jews\" were in Rome during the "},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"time of Nero and before. Indeed, as he explained, Poppaea, the wife of Nero, was of Jewish descent. She was from the \"race of Abraham.\" She had made herself a spokesperson for her people and pleaded their case within the high est echelons of Roman society. The favor that Nero and other powerful Romans extended to the Jews allowed them to rise and prosper. Gibbon stresses that Nero's eventual persecution of the Christians was due to his wife's pressure and conniving. W e also kno w that the Herods were one of Rome's most illustrious and prestigious families and must not forget that it was they who were, from approximately 36 BC, given charge of Judea by the Roman emperors. The Herodians, before they came to Rome, were Edomites , tha t is, they were connected with the Hyksos dynasty of Egypt. The word Edom is believed to have meant \"red men,\" or \"men from the red land.\" The color red is used as a code insignia of the Hyksos bloodline. The Herod family was both Jewish and Roman. Idumea - south of Judea, the original homeland of the Herods before they moved to Rome. The Herodians, known as \"Kings of the Jews\" were a J ewish - Roman elite of great power and prestige. They were Edomites (Idumeans) or Hyksos, that is - Atonists From the accession of Caligula to the death of Nero, Jewish cabals never ceased at Rome. Jews had greatly aided in bringing the family of Germanicus to power and sustaining it. Whether through the Herods or other intriguers, they beset the palace...Josephus is rather favorable to Nero, whom he considers to have been slandered...Poppaea, according to him, was a woman of piety, favorable to the Jews, su pporting the claims of their zealots, and adopting some of their rites...Nero, hating everything Roman, liked to turn to the East, to surround himself with orientals, and keep up intrigues in that quarter - Ernest Renan ( The Origins of Christianity, Vol. 4 : The Antichrist ) This level of patronization of rich \"Jews\" in Rome alerts us because, although we hear of the Roman \"persecution\" of Christians by Romans, we also find that Paul, the founder of Christianity, did not condemn the Romans. In his work, Ponti us Pilate is not responsible for the execution of Christ or for the suppression of god's \"chosen people.\" To Paul, the Romans were not an invading enemy but a force for good being hard pressed by Jewish resistance. It is obvious to us that it was not, as m ost commentators believe, Paul's aim to exonerate and lionize ordinary Roman citizens. His intent was to laud a certain quorum within Roman society, namely his own masters - the Atonists who would conspire with Jew and Roman alike as long as doing so serve d their secret cause. ...confusion in the use of terms is illustrated in Paul's use of the category \"Jew,\" which, strictly speaking, could include only a descendant of Judah.

Joseph Hoffmann ( Jesus in History and Myth ) Many modern scholars have taken the Sadducees as the representatives of ancient Judaism, standing out against Pharisee innovation; but this picture has seri ous defects. The Sadducees were indeed defending the status quo, but it was a status quo of fairly recent duration, dating from the third century BC, when Judea was ruled by the Ptolemaic Greeks of Egypt. Under this regime, the High Priest was given centra l status and power by the Greek overlords, successors in the region to the power of Alexander the Great. The High Priesthood in this era was made an instrument of foreign rule, a role which it was to retain into the era of the Romans - Hyam Maccoby ( Mythma ker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity ) The most powerful group regarded as heretical by the Pharisees was that of the Sadducees, of whom frequent mention is made in the Gospels, where they are described as opponents of the Pharisees, without any clea r exposition of the point of conflict involved - ibid Anyone with knowledge of the religious and political scene at this time in Judea feels the presence of an important problem here: the High Priest was not a Pharisee, but a Sadducee, and the Sadducee wer e bitterly opposed to the Pharisees. How is it that Saul, allegedly and enthusiastic Pharisee...is acting hand in glove with the High Priest? The picture we are given in our New Testament sources of Saul, in the days before his conversion to Jesus, is contra dictory and suspect - ibid The priests and governors of Judea were personally appointed to their stations by the Flavian Caesars of Rome. It is coming to light that the Flavians were, through their agent Paul, one of the main conceivers of the Jesus story as it appears in the New Testament.

The plan had been in the works for at least 1,100 years and was destined to come about regardless of the skirmishes between Jewish zealots and Romans. The nobility of Rome were closely affiliated with the Cult of Aton from Egypt and may have been descended from them by blood as well as by ideology. The Atonists had left Egypt in the company of their Israelite brethren. After their exile, and after falling out amongst th emselves, the Atonists found themselves vulnerable and few in number. A coin of Herod the Great, known as \"King of the Jews.\" On the reverse si de we see the Atonist Solar Disk. Other coins bear the symbol of the star that signified the \"Anointed\" Kings of Egypt. These Atonist - Levites carried with them the gnosis imparted to them by Akhenaton and his descendants. They were a privileged priesthood and had little time for the mass of Israelites that had accompanied them and eventually fallen back to old pagan beliefs. A close reading of the factional conflict at Mount Sinai reveals as much. W e read that Moses (Akhenaton) became furious after discove ring his disgruntled followers were backsliding into the worship of the golden calf (symbol for the god Amen - Ra and the previous Age of Taurus). Herod the Great, shown with Atonist - Roman lion's head emblems As the centuries passed the elite Atonist Levites had less and less to do with their erstwhile lower class brethren, the Israelites. Ten tribes had assimilated into the W estern lands and on ly the so - called Tribes of Benjamin and Levi (The Levites) had stayed true to the oral tradition handed down to them at Sinai. These hardliners knew themselves to be heirs of the pharaohs and they did not relish their fate, nor plan to continue scrounging around the wastelands in exile. They had their minds set on ingratiation with their many allies in Assyria, Babylonia, Crete, Greece, and Italy. It is our belief that they were more than successful in their intent and that they did indeed enjoy the confide nce of foreign powers.

The Atonists who insinuated themselves into the upper class of Roman society considered themselves direct descenda nts of Akhenaton. They were the \"Messiah\" that Jews were foolishly expecting. Paul and his Christ character of the New Testament were merely loudspeakers, messengers, proclaimers crying in the wilderness \"make straight the way of the Lord Aton.\" My desire is not of the flesh, Who has borne all afflictions like me?

And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not r evealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.

It can be found encrypted within the Old Testament and among the words of previous old world prophets. The strange predictions of a coming savior that misinformed Christians believe exist in the books of Daniel and Isaiah do not refer to Jesus. Th ey refer to the one for whom the Gospel Jesus spoke, for whom the inventors of Jesus spoke. Whether these inventors were Roman emperors or Egyptian sun priests, their agenda was the re - creation and re - establishment of a solar religion that had failed to ga lvanize the world at the first attempt. The second attempt was to succeed. All human beings would leave aside their petty allegiances and would remove their blindfolds. They would bow before the new lords of light and their bright stainless king. One of th e most interesting prophecies concerning a hard - pressed future Messiah appears in the Old Testament's Book of Isaiah. Most Christians believe this passage to be a reference to the trials, tribulations, and ultimate undoing of Jesus. However, as many expert s have stated, poetic and pathetic lamentations on the doomed fate of a reluctant, peace - loving, and otherworldly Messiah were never written by Jewish authors for a Jewish audience. Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquai nted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

The intellectual elite within the Sadducees and Romans were not in the least bit perturbed by the zealots of Judea. They considered the Messianic idea of ordinary Jews totally redundant. If pacifying Jews was their desire they could have groomed a real, living savant and let him loose, professing himself to be the Messiah. They could have promoted a man to im personate the Messiah and no one would have been the wiser. This would have made better sense than to simply create the history of one in writing and hope that people would read it and react. No! The idea was to create a new religion based on the old Atoni st model to appeal to a W estern audience. W hether this religion and its Christ was accepted by the Jews or not was barely a concern. They could accept Christ or they could deny him. W hat did it matter to Rome and the Caesars? This is why Josephus barely me ntions the Messiah in his vast works and why Christianity was established in Rome and not Judea. Christianity was the brain - child of one small elite group of Atonists resident in Rome, and of their intellectual colleagues, the Sadducees. Its central hero w as a hybrid of several pagan deities and heroes, and partly based on the old Jewish Messiah. But the creators of the new religion, and of Christ, knew that the real Messiah was an Egyptian concept and not a Jewish one. The real Messiah was a descendant of the House of David, and that meant them. The claims made by the Jews meant nothing and would never come to pass - as they have not. Among the priests, it was chiefly a few families of great wealth and political influence with the reigning power who were Sa dducees. The Sadducee party, indeed, formed a small majority among the Jewish people, comprising wealthy landowners as well as wealthy priests. People such as these were the natural allies of whatever authority happened to be in power, whether Ptolemaic Gr eek, Seleucid Greeks, Hasmoneans, Herodians or Romans - Hyam Maccoby ( Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity )"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Official Jewish history indicates that the Sadducees and Pharisees were rivals but the division between these kindred sects occurred re latively late in their history.

The conflict finally abated and history books tell us that the Sadducees finally ceased to exist after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. W e are not, however, convinced that the Sadducees just vanished into thin air at this time. They were on excellent terms with the Roman nobility and would have been protected and forewarned of R ome's retaliation against Jerusalem. The Pharisees were...a class whose tendency was to form a kind of intellectual aristocracy among the Jews.

They were a conservative upper class while the Pharisees were distinguished by their intellectual expertise and great learning. The word Pharisee meant \"those se t apart\" or \"those standing alone.\" In the Hasmonean period, numerous, often competing Jewish religious groups, sometimes referred to as sects, had begun to form. They continued to vie for influence in the Herodian period. The best known of these were the Pharisees, the only group (other than the Christians) to survive the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. Pharisaic thought became the foundation of rabbinic Judaism, the Judaism that has survived to this day - Hershel Shanks ( Understanding the Dead Se a Scrolls ) The Sadducees were also known as Zadokites (from tsedduqim ) after the high priest Zadok who had anointed King Solomon (Sol, Sun). This Zadokite order has now been discovered to be very ancient. The Qumran community responsible for the so - called \"Damascus Document,\" and the Dead Sea Scrolls, were affiliated with it, and its members included Jesus, John the Baptist, Simon Magus, Judas Maccabeus, and Ezra. The Sadducee bloodline connection to the first of the Zadokite high priests reveals, to those who have done their homework, their Egyptian origins since this \"Solomon\" who established the \"Zadokite\" order was none other than the eighteenth dynasty Pharaoh Amenhotep III, the father of Akhenaton.

Throughout the Bible they are variously depicted as wicked and evil. They are depicted as being the wealthy ruling families who controlled the High Priesthood during the time of Jesus...the Sadducees were famous for denying the salvation of the human soul, in their obsessi on in the pleasures of life, power and sex and in black magic...many scholars believe the claims of the Sadducees being followers of Zadok are false and refer to their following ―some other‖ teacher - (from: OneFaithofGod.org) Although the coming of such a p olitically active Messiah was attractive to the oppressed and disenfranchised lower classes, it meant less to those of higher rank profiting from lucrative alliances with the powerful and relatively tolerant invaders. Moreover, focus on the history of a Me ssianic figure would reveal too much about the actual Egyptian origins of the Judaism. This was a major fear and it still is. The elites within Judaism (in particular the Sadducees), who had their minds set on assimilation into W estern elite circles, were not eager for it to be known abroad that their Moses was none other than Akhenaton and that their own origins were to be found in the despised land of Egypt. This knowledge was reserved for the highest ranks and was never to become common knowledge. It was a slice of information that would interest Romans of distinction and class.

As long as Christians thought in romantic terms of the \"holy land\" and the “kingdom of heaven,” their attention was not focused on the Romans. And this was a suitable situation as far as the Atonists of Rome are concerned. ...the new priesthood instituted in the Pauline Christian Church was accorded an awesome authority which th e Jewish priesthood never enjoyed - Hyam Maccoby The Sadducees of the Temple of Jerusalem knew how detrimental belief in a raging Messiah would be to their interests. They knew only too well that there was no way for a Pharisaic Messiah to be accepted or w elcomed in Rome by Gentiles. They also knew that the Jewish people were not going to jubilantly accept Rome as the capital city of the new church. So, we insist that it was a coterie of Sadducees who, during the Roman occupation, commissioned \"historians\" in Egypt, Judea, and Rome, to concoct the Messiah story. W e do not accept the theories of those scholars (Joseph Atwill and others) who strive to prove that the situation was the reverse, i.e., that Romans, for their own purposes, invented the Christ story . W e do not feel that the Jesus story was created merely to dampen or offset the revolutionary spirit among lower class Jews in Judea. W e do not believe that those who had smashed the Temple and removed the Jewish Torah to Rome, were particularly worried a bout Jewish uprising. The Roman Empire was large. If they were inclined to concoct new religions and new divine heroes to dupe the people of the lands they occupied they would have done so for every one of the places they overran and conquered. And this is not the case. Massacre, persecution, and oppressive legal prohibition, were the manner in which Rome dealt with open hostility and rivalry. Taking out the head men and dispensing fear were the methods used to maintain order in foreign parts. Making friend s of the intellectual classes and employing \"Quislings\" from the conquered peoples also paid dividends. Demonstrating a relatively tolerant attitude toward the religious beliefs of compliant nations was also a clever ploy to win acceptance. It appears that the Romans permitted their conquered peoples to continue worshiping as they saw fit, as long as they also accepted the divinity of Caesar. Rome attempted not to replace the gods of its provinces but to absorb them. By the end of the first century, Rome ha d accumulated so many foreign gods that virtually every day of the year celebrated some divinity - Joseph Atwill ( Caesar's Messiah ) Roman emperors appointed all the high priests recorded within the New Testament from a restricted circle of families who wer e allied to Rome - ibid It was essential for Paul, and to those who funded him, that Jesus' appeal was strong enough to ensure interest from Western nations.

It would even fool some Jews into believing Christ to be their Messiah, one who was not opposed to the invaders but who encouraged neighborliness and brotherly love. The Gospel Jesus' rebuffs to the belligerent queries of the Pharisees were cunning interpolations. In time, after a few decades had elapsed, and after its establishment, Christianity's Judaic origins could be acknowledged. But in its inception the emphasis was to be placed on its nove lty. Conversely, the rank and file of Jewry would be coerced by their Pharisaic rabbis and teachers to ostensibly reject this Christ and his conformist teachings. And this rejection of the new religion by old world, old school Jews further served to convey the impression that there were few points of similarity between the two religions. Romans and other Gentile nations could accept the Christ figure who was ridiculed doubted, hunted, tortured, and finally crucified by his own spiritually recalcitrant peopl e. What we see with Paul's work is an ingenious revamping of the old Egyptian solar religion that had been grinding to a halt with rabbinical Pharisaism. It has seen its day and was to be replaced by something fresh, liberally embellished with familiar pag an elements and motifs. Naturally, there would be those who could not let go and who would continue as believers of the old worn out worthless version, but the focus was on new converts, followers and believers. That which we know as “Judaism” was to be ro lled back while “Christianity” was to be brought out before all. Those attempting to question or resist the new world order emanating from Rome would be destroyed. Choice and free will were not part of the deal. There is nothing holy about the Bible, nor is it ―the word of God.‖ It was not written by God - inspired saints, but by power - seeking priests. Who but priests consider sin the paramount issue? Who but priests write volumes of religious rites and rituals? No one, but for these priestly scribes were sin and rituals imperatives. Their purpose was to found an awe - inspiring religion. By this intellectual tyranny they sought to gain control,"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"and they achieved it. By 400 BC, they were the masters of ancient Israel. For such a great project they needed a theme, a framework, and this they found in the Creation lore of more knowledgeable races. This they commandeered and perverted - the natural to the supe rnatural, and the truth to error. The Bible is, we assert, but priest - perverted cosmology - Lloyd Graham ( Myths and Deceptions of the Bible ) The following agreement in the writings under the names of \"Matthew,\" \"Mark,\" and \"Luke,\" regarding the impression made upon the people by the teachings of Jesus, is an example which shows plainly the work of the forging priests. It would be impossible for such agreement to have occurred in the original writings of any three men writing individually and independently.. .Here is forged testimony: Matthew says: \"They were astonished at his doctrine\" (22:33), Mark says: \"They were astonished at his doctrine\" (1:22), Luke says: \"They were astonished at his doctrine.\" (55:32) - Conor Mac Dari ( Irish Wisdom Preserved in the Bi ble and Pyramids, 1923) And so, in light of this, we must be wary of Christian teachers professing Christianity and Judaism to be alien to one another, and must carefully regard those teachers who acknowledge the underlying and fundamental connections and likeness. The Christians who refuse to accept Abraham and Moses as the fathers of Judaism and Christianity believe they are elevating themselves and their chosen religion above the roguery and corruption of Talmudism. In fact, their attempts at exclusivity are ill conceived, given that both Christianity and Talmudic Judaism are concoctions of the same elusive coterie. The pope who ostensibly heads Catholicism from the Vatican (\"Place of Sorcery\") wears the Judaic regalia for a reason. The Lutheran priests a nd court magistrates and school teachers who adorn themselves in the long black robe of the rabbis also do so for a reason. W hether it is the tassel on the square \"mortar board\" headgear of graduates, or the many Christian festival holidays, or the symbols employed by W estern royal families and their governments, the \"Judaic\" (Atonist) elements are evident. About 1945, Dr. John Haynes Holmes, of the Community Church in New York City, preached and printed two sermons which should have created widespread exci tement and led to definite action of more or less drastic character. The first was entitled: ―Christianity‘s Debt to Judaism: Why Not Acknowledge It?‖ In it he adduced that Christianity owed its (alleged) founder, Jesus, to the Jews (he might have added al so its actual founder, St. Paul, a Jew); secondly, it derived five - sixths of its Bible - the Old Testament - from the Jews; thirdly, it owed everything that its (alleged) founder, Jesus, said, did and functioned as, to the Talmud, the Mishna, the Gemara, t he Midrash, the Torah and other Haggadoth (sacred books) of the Jews. The inference stands that what Christianity did not derive from the Jews was practically nothing at all... His other sermon was entitled: ―The Religion of the Pharaoh Akhenaton.‖ In it he expatiated upon the singular historical fact that at a date some thirteen hundred years B.C. the young son of Amenhotep, coming to the throne before the age of thirty, introduced into the priestly religion of old Egypt the elements of a reform movement whi ch on examination prove to fall so closely in line with the highest, purest and truest character of Christianity that Dean Weigal, of the Yale Divinity School, has pronounced them fully equal in spiritual loftiness to anything in Christianity - Alvin Boyd Kuhn ( Case of the Missing Messiah )"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25 . The Babylonian Talmud Anyone who does not study the Talmud cannot understand Scripture - Hyam Maccoby ( Judaism on Trial ) Judaism is not a religion and the Jews are not a nation - Lady Queensborough ( Occult T heocracy ) The average Jew has yet to realize that although they have been expertly taught to regard themselves to be \"People of the Book\" the book in question is not the Torah but the Talmud (and also Mishnah). The descendants of the ancient Talmudists fro m Sinai, the followers of \"Moses\" who have expertly duped the world, are alive and well. They operate from behind the veils of Judaism and Christianity, the religions of their own making. It is the ancient oral tradition that is of value and importance to them and it was a tradition not meant for the laity. It was reserved for the elite, the Naassians, Kohanim, Levites, Gaonim, and Pharisees. This tradition was finally codified as the Palestinian Talmud and the Babylonian Talmud. Some teachings were handed on orally, and some things were handed on in writing...we conclude that the ones that are handed on orally are more precious - The Hagigah (Talmudic Treatise) The Jews have always insisted that two laws were delivered to Moses on Mount Sinai. One was writ ten and the other transmitted orally to pass from generation to generation. The oral law was the key to all hidden wisdom, the written law was intended for the ignorant outsider. The interpretation was for the Initiates - E. Valentia Straiton ( The Celestia l Ship of the North ) Towards the middle of the fifth century AD, a Mishna code was formed in Palestine and, at the end of the same century, a second code at Babylon. Both codes were called \"Talmud\"...While the Palestinian Talmud played an insignificant par t in the subsequent life of Jewry, the Babylonian Talmud was regarded as a national possession. It has remained \"The Book\" for Orthodox Jewry. It replaced the Torah as the fountain of all wisdom and as the guide in every detail of daily life. The Talmud, d espite its character as a commentary upon a commentary upon a Law of uncertain origin, has not only preserved the Jewish Nation but has imbued it with a Pharisee spirit and separated it, perhaps forever, from the main stream of human culture - H. W. Steed ( The Hapsburg Monarchy ) The Talmud provided the means of determining how God wanted Jews to live, in all places, at all times.

These passages were, we believe, deliberately added to give readers the false impr ession that Judaism and Christianity are not kindred religions. The grotesquely slanderous comments are patently gratuitous and incendiary. They are obviously the work of clever propagandists and certainly do not truly reflect the beliefs of elite Jews ini tiated into the truth about Judaism's origins. Thus they call Him [Jesus] the child of a whore and His mother, Mary, a whore, whom she had in adultery...Reluctantly I must speak so coarsely in opposing the Devil...We do not call our wives whores as they call Maria, the Mother of Jesus; we do not call them bastards, as they call our Lord Christ. We do not curse them, but wish them all manner of bodily and spiritual good; permit them to lodge with us. We don't steal and mutilate their children; do not poison the ir water; do not thirst after their blood - Martin Luther (an excerpt from The Jews and their Lies, 1540 AD) The horrified readers of scandalous passages on Jesus would be all the more likely to reject Judaism in favor of the more civilized Christianity - a reaction that satisfies those who had concocted the offending passages that belittle Gentiles and that speak of burning Christian books or of the \"bastard\" Jesus and his whorish mother, etc. These passages are so heinous that all Jews might suffer persec ution as a result of their existence. So why have they remained in the Talmud for all Christians and Gentiles to see and read? W hy have they not been removed by enlightened Jews of recent ages? Everything about Judaism is either a distortion of or a falsif ication of the Old Testament because Judaism is based on a man - made tradition that voids the Old Testament by means of a series of dispensations and loopholes - Michael A. Hoffman II ( Judaism's Strange Gods ) After the destruction of the Temple by the Roman Emperor Titus Vespasian, in AD 70, the Talmudist elders re - grouped in Babylon and opened many secret colleges there in order to preserve their traditions. At least this is the official story. It is more likely that the Gaonim of Babylon were, like the Sad ducees, in league with the elite Romans, and that these colleges were convened not by Jewish enemies of Rome but by Romanized Jews seeking to preserve the secret Egyptian traditions of kabala, sacred geometry, hermetic magic, and so on. The name Gaonim der ives from gaon meaning \"the prideful,\" or \"men of"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"genius.\" The head of a Gaonate was known as \"His Excellency.\" He was a Gaon . The suffix on refers to the city of Heliopolis and means \"light\" or \"sun.\" The Gaonim, as heads of the school in the Babylonian c ities Sura and Pumbeditha, enjoyed far more than local authority. The Jews of Persia were practically independent of external control. Their official heads were the Exilarchs, who reigned over the Jews as viceroys of the caliphs. The Gaonim were the religi ous heads of an emancipated community. The Exilarchs possessed a princely revenue, which they devoted in part to the schools over which the Gaonim presided. This position of authority, added to the world - wide repute of the two schools, gave the Gaonim an i nfluence which extended beyond their own neighborhood. From all parts of the Jewish world their guidance was sought and their opinions solicited on a vast variety of subjects, mainly, but not exclusively, religious and literary - Israel Abrahams ( Chapters on Jewish Literature ) The Exilarchs of the Gaonim compiled the Talmud and Torah knowing full well what ordinary Jews and Christians were never meant to know, namely, that the roots of Judaism and Christianity had been inherited from the great solar college s and temples of the Nile, from the three - hundred year reign of the Hyksos kings, and from the Atonist Pharaoh Akhenaton and his skewed version of sun worship. Once the Gaonim set to work expunging obviously pagan elements they could lay claim to that whic h was not theirs to begin with. They could maintain that Yahweh had communicated the Law to their ancestors at Mount Sinai. They could downplay Egypt and form themselves into what appeared to be a distinctly unique religious sect. Paul and his Christians c ould do likewise and all would be well. And so we have it - Judaism and Christianity - two hands serving the same brain. The Gaonim (or at least their occult ways) would later be an active part of the Freemasonic Order. The cryptic masonic insignia \"G\" ref ers to and belongs to them. The rabbis...divided the glory of these apocryphal histories with the Freemasons; indeed, there is good reason for a suspicion that nearly all the Masonic legends owe their existence to the imaginative genius of the writers of the Jewish Talmud - Albert.

This is why they paid only passing regard to the beloved historical figures, known to the Jews, who would have been rather ideal characters in such a phantasmagoric story as was being composed. ...if Paul was not a Pharisee rooted in Jewish learning and tradition, but instea d a Hellenistic adventurer whose acquaintance with Judaism was recent and shallow, the"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"construction of myth and theology which he elaborated in his letters becomes a very different thing.

Why was a Judaic cult that advocated meekness and poverty so attractive to a family that practiced neither? - Joseph Atwill ( Caesar's Messiah ) The duplicitous Paul can accurately be described as Christianity's \"Madison Avenue PR man,\" its spin doctor funded to recast Jesus and make his supposed personality and doctrine palatable to a W estern Gentile audience. So, in the writings of Paul, it was not the Romans who were responsible for Jesus' demise but the Jews of the Temple of Jerusalem. Paul's \"Christ\" had a message for all mankind and not only for staunch believers of the Torah. He was not a political Messiah sent to indict and accuse Romans but a Christ sent by god with a spiritual message for all mankind. Paul's Jesus is con spicuously presented as a rival to the Pharisees and their Sanhedrin. (See Mark 7 and Matthew 15). Christianity is the religion founded by Paul, which replaces Jesus' Gospel with a Gospel about Jesus - a religion that should rather be called Paulinism - Wi lhelm Nestle Those who expected a political messiah were disillusioned when Jesus refused the claim that he was such not a messiah and would have no part of the schemes to make him king. And finally, those who expected an eschatological apocalypse were tol d that they would see no signs from heaven and that they would hear from Jesus no guess as to when the last days would be fulfilled. In other words, Jesus rejected the titles, the categories, the theories, and the aspirations of all religious movements of his time.

Instead of extolling the uniqueness of the Jews, he preached Good News for all men - Andrew M. Greely ( The Jesus Myth ) Paul's Christ recommended giving unto Caesar his due and not fighting against him. Christ's message compelled one to turn the other cheek and to forgive enemies. Paul's \"Christ\" did not advocate, as did the Torah, the living of a spotless moral life. It s tressed being forgiven for all sins and moral infractions by Christ. It stressed belief and acceptance by faith. It let one off the hook and this doctrine was most attractive to the kings, emperors, and nobles of the W est.

Paul drew heavily on paganism in order to make his Christ figure familiar to a pagan audience. For this offense he was naturally spurned by the orthodox Jews who were still committed to the old calcified and convoluted paradigm. All the while Paul knew exactly who the real \"Christs\" were - his own Roman backers - the Flavians, Pisos, and other Atonist families of Rome and the Orient. It was for them that a new religion had to be fashioned and imposed upon the world. It was from their capital city that it would eventually be established and to a W estern audience that it would matter most in the end. If it pacified Jewish revolt that was good. But this is not the reason for which Christianity was created, as so many authors and historians conjecture. Vespasian is referred to...as ―the divine Christ‖ and ―Lord‖...Vespasian was not only ―Jesus,‖ or savior of Judea, but...he was also the ―Christ,‖ a Greek word for the Messiah - Joseph Atwill ( Caesar's Messiah ) Dioclet ian chose a new title for himself, calling himself Dominus et deus, or \"Lord and God\" - (Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia, on Emperor Diocletian) Due to their antipathy toward the complicit Jerusalem Church, many Jews decided to join breakaway sects and remov e themselves to remote regions in order to preserve the ways of the Torah and to facilitate an unadulterated lifestyle. Among the most important of these sects were the Essenes, presumably the composers of the Dead Sea Scrolls . W hen these texts were re - dis covered in the twentieth century the Vatican's hierarchy were deeply threatened. The Vatican officialdom knew that these documents would contain information on Paul and on the false brand of Christianity concocted for W estern audiences. The campaign to sup press the texts and to prevent their worldwide publication is rooted in this fear. The Dead Sea Scrolls may not have been written by the Essenes at all. That was merely the first conjecture made by experts shortly after their discovery. The Scrolls do not mention any such group as the Essenes. It is not even agreed that the Essenes were Jewish. Finally in AD 70 the Romans, under Titus Vespasian, destroyed the temple (believed to be at Jerusalem) and scattered the Nazarene Church that never coalesced again. The religion of the Judeans was abolished by this very physical and clear action. From that time onward the spurious Christianity of Paul flourished with little opposition. The Atonists had succeeded in birthing a brand new version of their antique religio n. The old capsule could be jettisoned and smashed. So what, if a few disgruntled and landless zealots continued to hang on to the old way? They were no threat and could do as they willed.

The best known figure of this kind was Marcion, who lived about a hundred years after Paul, and rega rded Paul as his chief inspiration.

He regarded the Jewish scriptures as the work of the Devil and he excluded the Old Testament from his version of the Bib le - Hyam Maccoby ( Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity ) Marcion's prejudiced message, even more than Paul's, served to emphasize the differences between Christianity and Judaism.

Interestingly, despite the unequivocal edict of the Ro man government, Paul recommended it as most suitable for this Christian audience. The work was not composed by pagan King Hystaspes from Media, but by a Jew. The prophecy, so called, spoke of two all powerful but terrible kings who would reign over differe nt nations. The first tyrant king would: \" ...harass the world with his intolerable rule...and shall meditate new designs in his breast, that he may establish the government for himself...And finally, he shall change the name of the empire and transfer its seat.\" The second king would be considerably worse than his predecessor and would annihilate and replace the first king. He would then bring down fire from the sky and command the entire world to worship him as the true and only son of god. Through his pow er and charisma the second king would get his way. There have been several intriguing interpretations of this prophecy concerning the two kings of the Earth, mostly involving the conflict between Mark Anthony and Caesar Augustus. Some scholars have noted t he similarity between the two kings and the two beasts of John's Book of Revelation presumed to have been composed around 80 AD. In John's account (13:11) the second beast, that speaks like a great dragon, commands the world to make an image of the first b east that had suffered a terrible but slowly healing wound. W e agree that the two separate fables are related and perhaps composed by the same school. However, in our reading of the bizarre allegories we conceive it as probable that the two kings or beasts are aspects of a single personality. The reference"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"to two entities appears to us a clever device serving to distract the lay reader from the subtextual message concerning the fate of but one party. In our mind, the kings or beasts represent two phases of a single experience. The personality they represent was a great presence in the world. He was a great \"two - horned\" or \"double - crowned\" king who suffered a near mortal blow to his regency and fortune. As he recovered, he took on a new personality. He became his own doppelganger and had like Janus two faces, one looking back into the past and one peering into the future. For all his tribulations and losses his power drive remained strong and focused. W hen his life - force was restored he strove obsessively to h ave his previous reign over the world everlastingly remembered. Although it was of the past it was never to be lost or outshone. And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerc iseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the si ght of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, a nd did live. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and p oor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads - (Revelation 13:11 - 16) According to rabbinical tradition, when Aaron was selected by Moses at Mount Sinai to be his successor, he was marked upon his forehead with the symbol of a cross. Indeed, as Laurence Gardner has pointed out in his Genesis of the Grail Kings, the cross or sigil \"X\" has long been the distinguishing occult insignia of monarchs, princes, and priests; particularly those of Judah, Egypt, Britain, and America. The king to come would be great but not merciful. The world would follow his way and obey his commands or suffer the wrath of heaven. According to the Oracle of Hystaspes: When the time draws nigh, a great prophet shall be sent from God to turn men to the knowledge of God. And he will receive the power of doing wonderful things. Whenever men shall not hear him, he will shut up the heaven, and cause it to withhold its rains; he will turn water into blood...and if anyone shall endeavor to injure him, fire shal l come forth out of his mouth and shall burn that man.

The Broken Kings (Solar - Theology and the Origin of the Israelites) Thou art my battle - axe and weapons of war: for with thee I will break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I break in pieces kingdoms - (Jeremiah 51: 20 - 21) Those who begin to make an in - depth study of secret societies soon discover that a pyramidical hierarchy serves the masters best, allowing ea ch cell within the greater edifice to operate efficiently and routinely. And, like a pyramid of stone, the virtual one of hierarchy does not shake or fall should one cell be removed or changed. Those occupying lower strata of the edifice can perform their tasks uninhibited by knowledge of, or concerns regarding, the higher unseen and impenetrable levels they may not realize exist. Students of secret societies habitually seek to find out what power governs from the highest pinnacle of the power pyramid. In t his author's estimation few researchers manage to coherently disclose the identity and nature of that over - arching body. Attempts have been made to prove that the upper echelon is masonic, Jewish cabalist, white supremacist, Sirian, or Reptilian, etc, etc. Although some of these theories are interesting we cannot forget for an instant the message of the symbolism before us. In the vast majority of cases the secret society symbolism hearkens from two places - Ireland and Egypt. W ith this ever in mind, this author has deemed it logical to search for the origins of the super - secret steering order in those lands. Egypt receives our attention because the high priests of the temples and mystery schools there were, during the latter part of the eighteenth dynasty (approximately 4,000 years ago), divided ideologically due to an important and controversial astrological occurrence. At that time important changes were happening in the heavens. The sun was moving house. That is to say, it was transiting from the sign of Taurus to that of Aries. In the Astro - Theological language of the initiates god (the sun) was moving from the sign or The Holy Ark - this feminine symbol, like most \"Israelite\" symbols and traditions, originated in Egypt. The story of the Israelites, and Levites, or 12 Tribes, is the story of Akhenaton's Atonists"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"house of the Bull (or Cow) to the house of the Ram (or Lamb). And such a change was to be analogized by changes in the symbolic canon and the rites and observances of the sun priests. That the Levites honored the change can be seen from a glance at their Passover rituals. The scholar Ernest Busenbark reminded us, in his work, that it was approximately 3,000 years ago (during the so - called \" Age of Taurus\") that the Solar Cults gained greater power. He wrote: ... sun worship does not appear to have existed as a distinct and separate system, but was simply grafted on the older cult; and after the two became fused, the sun eventually became the dominant figure. During the transition into the Age of Aries the rulers in Egypt, and the Solar Cult's most prominent leaders, were the so - called \"Broken Kings\" of the eighteenth dynasty, namely , the ancestors and descendants of Amenhotep IV (Akhenaton). Scholars Ahmed Osman, Moustafa Gadalla, and Ralph Ellis, have expertly and controversially shown that many of these personalities were prototypes for later biblical characters. The main nobles an d royals of the eighteenth dynasty are as follows. (The dates of reign are approximates, and are subject to rectification.)

Pharaoh Heremheb took the throne by force after Aye in order to overthrow the Atonists. He banished Akhenaton (Moses), and restored the old gods. The name Amenhotep was rendered as Ameno phis by the Greek historians. In certain lists, for example, Akhenaton would be called Amenophis IV. This punitive, intolerant, self - important, and renegade dynasty, lionized by modern historians were, as investigator W illiam Bramley rightly advocates, senior priests of the pre - diluvian Dragon Court, or \"Brotherhood of the Snake.\" These lords, and their senior ministers and priests, symbolized their long genealogies by a tree and a serpent. W e still use the image of a tree today when charting family hist ories. The serpent was appropriate because it represented not only the movement of time but the secret tradition preserved by these families through the ages. This sacred tradition came down from the pre - diluvian epochs and those who were initiated into it employed the symbol of the serpent. The image of the serpent or dragon signified kingship, civic authority, and spiritual mastery. During the corrupt rule of the Broken Kings the people of Egypt were expressly forbidden from venerating any other deity ex cept the sun god Aton (or Aten). The Atonists forcibly closed the great temples, instigated their monotheistic cult, and allowed foreign elements in to the country. They had centers at Gizeh, Amarna, Avaris, and Tanis, and specifically at Heliopolis, where the powerful Solar Cult had been established for millennia.

He was not of royal blood and it is suggestive that he was apparently not favored by his own energetic chariot - riding father Pharaoh Amenhotep II. The"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"consensus of modern scholars is that Tuthmosis IV was selected for the throne by the priests of the sun cult at Heliopolis.

Close scrutiny of the titles and careers of the officials active during the reigns of Tuthmosis IV and Amenophis III confirms this conclusion: no longer are the state‘s key administrative posts held by members of the Amun priesthood, they have gone to more dependable subjects, including the viceroy of Nubia and other members of the military - Nicholas Reeves ( Akhenaton: Egypt's False Prophet ) The accession of Tuthmosis IV was a decisive moment, heralding a discernible increase of kingly interest in the solar cult - particularly at Gizeh...as well as at Re‘s center, Heliopolis itself...The Heliopolitan influence, however, is most clearly revealed in Tuthmosis IV‘s personal identification with the sun god. For the first time, we see pharaoh wearing in life the distinctive beaded shebyu collar and armlets of gold previously worn only in a funerary context, and occasionally...displaying on his head the disc emblem of the sun - god - ibid Amenhetep II was succeeded about B.C. 1450 by his son Thothmes IV, who seems to have owed his accession to the throne, not to the priests of Amen, but to the priests of Heliopolis. His mother was not of royal rank , and it is probable that her religious sympathies were with the old solar gods of Heliopolis rather than with Amen, or Amen - Ra, of Thebes - E. A. W. Budge ( Tutankhamen: Amenism, Atenism, and Egyptian Monotheism ) Tuthmosis IV was, like his father Amenhotep II, a belligerent pharaoh and one of the first to wage war without provocation beyond Egypt's boundaries. As a result of his aggressive attacks slaves and foreign elements were common in Egypt. Consequently, there was more intermarriage during his reign t han at other times. Egypt was visited by merchants and traders and was extremely prosperous and cosmopolitan during this period. As history teaches us, decadence and nihilism all too soon follow such prosperity. A single pharaoh's desire and action to adve rtise his own potency and god - like qualities can be of benefit to one priestarchy in competition with others. The idea of the Heliopolitan priests was to augment the reputation of the king they selected so that he would, in turn, elevate their god Atum Ra (later Aton). Aton's image would be all the more illustrious for the deeds done in his name by a strong, potent pharaoh. Tuthmosis IV packed a lot into his life. Something of a dandy with his shoulder - length dyed hair, long fingernails and pierced ears, th e fourth Tuthmosis nevertheless laid solid foundations for the next four decades' achievements. A clear supporter of the sun god, he realized the need to keep Amen's priests happy too, adding new buildings to Karnak and finally getting round to setting up the golden obelisk begun by his father, Tuthmosis III...Tuthmosis IV is known to have had a number of children by his various"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"wives, and after the premature death of his elder son, Amenemhat, the kind went against royal tradition and publicly declared youn g king Amenhotep to be his heir - Dr. Joann Fletcher ( The Search for Nefertiti ) Tuthmosis IV died relatively young (before 30) and left a very young Amenhotep III (also of mixed blood) in the hands of the priests. Amenhotep III (the prototype for the bibli cal king Solomon) could only have been between 2 and 12 years of age when he was made pharaoh of Egypt. Because of his young age others stepped in to take control of Egypt from behind the throne. The two most likely candidates were his step - parents - t he Israelites - Yuya and Tuya. Scholars recognize their Israelite origins and investigators such as Moustafa Gadalla, Ahmed Osman, and Ralph Ellis, are convinced (as we are) that Yuya was the biblical patriarch Joseph, the previous pharaoh's (Tuthmosis IV) \"dream - analyst\" and man with the \"coat of many colors.\" Ellis states that this Joseph (Yuya) had been elevated to high command and was not only the second most powerful Egyptian after pharaoh, he was the world's wealthiest human being. He was a person of commanding presence, whose powerful character showed itself in his face. One must picture him now as a tall man, with a fine shock of white hair, a great hooked nose like that of a Syrian, full, strong lips, and a prominent, determined jaw. He has the fac e of an ecclesiastic, and there is something about his mouth which reminds one of the late Pope, Leo XIII. One feels on looking at his well - preserved features, that there may be found the originator of the great religious movement which his daughter and gr andson carried into execution - Ahmed Osman Before we explore what the term \"Israelite\" truly referred to let us just emphasize the great power that Yuya and his family enjoyed. Being made Amenemhet - \"Amen is the Head\" (1991 - 1962 BC). He was the first king of the 12th Dynasty, and his ancestry is unknown. Some scholars suspect he was the prototype for the biblical patriarch known as Abraham. However, this wou ld place Abraham in Egypt before the official dates for the invasion of the Hyksos. The problem is less complicated once we understand that the Hyksos were not invaders from outside Egypt. They were foreign to Upper Egypt but not to Egypt itself. The group s that invaded during the 13th dynasty may have been related to the noble families of Lower Egypt, that is of the Hyksos Kings. They may have entered the land by invitation. Later, as the dynasties changes, these visitors appear to have been considered unw elcome guests, or even invaders. "},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"viceroy and vizier by the pharaoh gave him complete power over the entire country. It is likely that he and his wife were descendants of the Hyksos kings of previous dynasties, and of the Levites resident in Avaris at the time. Although the majority of the Hyksos people were frowned upon and even despised by native Egypti ans their upper class and priestly class were accepted and honored in pharaonic circles. Indeed, most of the pharaohs of the eighteenth dynasty may have possessed Hyksos blood. This is most important since recently discovered evidence reveals that the Hyksos settlers of Egypt were none other than the Israelites and Levites of Judeo - Christian history. The author Laurence Gardner believes that Y uya was indeed related to the Hyksos kings. Although he places the time of the Israelite Abraham excessively far back in time (to Pharaoh Senusret I of the 12th Dynasty) he does recognize the existence of a Royal Hyksos \"Dragon Court\" and the bloodline tha t he rightly states continues to rule the world. He says that the eighteenth dynasty pharaohs were of the same \"Dragon\" lineage. It is generally reckoned that the Hyksos Pharaoh Apepi II (Apophis) was the last hereditary Dragon King in Egypt, but it would appear that the heritage was perpetuated through the female line into the new dynasty. Even the grave of Ahmose's son Amenhotep I contained a preserved vase cartouche of the daughter of Apophis, which signifies the enmity was not so great between the house s as is traditionally supposed - Laurence Gardner ( Genesis of the Grail Kings ) The \"Dragon Court\" can also be named the \"Brotherhood of the Snake.\" This term denoted the bloodline that had existed from the time of the pre - diluvian civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria. At that time, human DNA was crossed genetically with that of alien visitors from other worlds, those referred to in the scriptures and myths as the Annunaki , the Nephilim , the Sons of God , or the Fallen Angels . The hybrid created from these t ransgenic experiments may be referred to as \"Homo Atlantis\" and also as the \"Son of the Serpent.\" From this first race of \"Adams\" all the races of the world have been \"begotten.\" Some humans cleave to the alien strain and some to the original human strain. From the Atlantean strain the kings of the world have been chosen and carefully recorded genealogies ensure that only the appropriately endowed individuals rule from the thrones of the world. The \"Dragon Bloodline\" has conflicts within their own ranks as well as adversaries from without. Nevertheless, they have maintained their hegemony and privilege through the centuries. Some investigators track the Bloodline back to Cain the elder brother of Abel and son of Adam and Eve. There are hints in the Book of G enesis that Cain was not the son of Adam but of the Annunaki, or heavenly \"fallen angels.\" The tyrant kings of the world"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"are thought to descend from Cain who was slanderously labeled a murderer. The error is thought to have occurred due to the mistranslati on of the word yaqam that did not mean \"slew\" but \"elevated.\" In other words, according to the occult interpretation, Abel was a lowly human while Cain was the son of the gods. Accordingly, the \"Mark of Cain\" was merely his symbol for royalty - the RX - th at is still to be seen used by the medical conglomerates and that reads REX - for king. The so - called \"coat of many colors,\" that the prophet Joseph is said to have been given by his father, is reminiscent of the garb worn by the high priests of Ireland. The Druid Magi wore elaborately decorated coats to distinguish their prestige within the solar cults. We can see this tradition carried on today with the robes and regalia employed by barristers, judges, magistrates, and mayors, etc. The Druids, both in Gaul...and in Ireland, were dressed in white, but Strabo speaks of their scarlet and gold embroidered robes, their golden necklets and bracelets. Again, the chief Druid of the king of Erin wore a coloured cloak and had earrings of gold, and in another inst ance a Druid wears a bull's hide and a white - speckled bird headpiece with fluttering wings - J. A. MacCulloch ( Religion of the Ancient Celts) In Ireland, they had the privilege of wearing six colours in their Breacans or robes, which are the striped Bracea e of the Gauls, still worn by the Highlanders, whereas the king and queen might have in theirs but seven, lords and ladies five - John Toland ( A Critical History of the Celtic Religion ) Their clothes, which consisted, according to the Latin writers, of a b louse with sleeves, trousers fitting closely round the ankles, and a shawl or cloak, fastened at the shoulder with a brooch, were made either of thick felt or of woven cloth dyed with various brilliant colours. The writer Diodorus tells us that they were c rossed with little squares and lines, \"as though they had been sprinkled with flowers\". They were, in fact, like \"tartans\", and we may believe Varro, who tells us that they \"made a gaudy show\" - Charles Squire (on the appearance of the Irish) O Sun! thou a rt the genial parent of Nature, splendent with various hues, shedding streams of golden light - (Orphic Song) Yuya's (Joseph's) power was enhanced and solidified after his daughter Tiye was betrothed and wedded to the young Pharaoh Amenhotep III (1382 - 1344 BC). This fortuitous marriage sealed the Israelite/Levite (Hyksos) line with the native Egyptian one.

The young Amenhotep married her at the beginning of his reign. She was not of royal blood, not a foreign princess, but the daughter of a civil - servant and provincial priest, Yuya. She was not like other queens before her, completely overshadowed by their royal husbands. In the past there had been a woman on the throne of Egypt - Hatshepsut, about a hundred years earlier - but none of the royal wives ever had such prominence as Tiye - Immanuel Velikovsky ( Oedipus and Akhnaton )"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"By marrying with Tiye and favoring her above the royal wife, Amenhotep III broke the great convention of Egypt. Until this apo state's seditious act the succession of Egyptian kings had always been through the royal blooded female line.

Hocart (Kingship The Egyptian women were entrusted with the civilization. The woman (princess) and not the male, was the legal heir to the throne, and the man she chose to marry would become the ruling Pharaoh - Moustafa Gadalla ( Historical Deception ) Tiye's lack of legal right did not prevent her from exercising a great deal of control over her easily swayed husband and from effectively ruling from \"behind the throne.\" She was adamantly resolved to have her son and not Sitamun's become pharaoh. To do this legally she had her strange mixed - blooded son Akhenaton (Amenhotep IV) marry with Sitamun's daughter, Akhenaton's half - sister, the famous Nefertiti. This marriage was merely a convenience to secure him the throne. Subse quently, during the twelfth year of Akhenaton's reign Nefertiti vanishes into the nether and her name is violently removed from many monuments. It is not clear whether she was a true believer in Aton or not. Certainly, the evidence hints that she was expen dable. Akhenaton saw to it, for instance, that his brother Smenkhare would rule after him and not his wife Nefertiti who had more legal right. This act betrays just how anti - Egyptian and pro - Israelite he was under the influence of his mother, the daughter of Joseph - the biblical patriarch. The Israelite step - parents of the young Amenhotep III had two sons as well as their daughter Tiye. They were called I sraelite and commoner, the super rich queen Tiye - mother of Akhenaton a nd prototype for the biblical Bathsheba. Her ambition brought chaos and ruin to Egypt. The Cult of Aton rose to great prominence during her personal reign prior to Akhenaton's. The second temple raised to Aton was in her name "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Aanen and Aye. The latter son has been identified by revisionist Egyptologists as the prototype for the mythic and fictive Joseph of Arimathea, the biblical relative of Jesus. Aye was a most important figure during the eighteenth dynasty and is recognized as a major force behind the thrones of Akhenaton, Smenkhare, and Tutankhamen. Ralph Ellis has gone so far as to say that Aye (also known as Aya) was none other than the person symbolically rendered in the bible as the god Yahweh. He provides etymological data to strengthen his singular thesis. (See, Scota: Queen of the Scots ). Tiye was not overly concerned whether Egypt would balk at accepting her foreign - blooded son as king. As long as he married legal ly he would have to be accepted as the legitimate pharaoh. It also appears that her husband Amenhotep III (King Solomon) had a very romantic and amorous nature. He constantly sought the company of women. The satisfaction of his physical needs appears to h ave been his primary passion in life, and his Israelite queen appears to not have interfered with his peccadilloes. Indeed, she exploited them. As a result Amenhotep III enjoyed intimate liaisons with innumerable native and foreign princesses. These liaiso ns ensured favorable relationships with foreign governments. Consequently, the reign of Amenhotep III and Tiye was known to have been a pleasant and nonviolent one. However, given Amenhotep III's success in sexual conquest we must ask questions concerning his overall competence as a ruler. It may be realistic, if rather alarming, to surmise that the official duties were taken over by his cunning wife and her retinue of Israelites. In other words, if we are seeking for any point during the eighteenth dynasty (other than the period of Akhenaton's personal reign) for gross breaches of normal procedure and conduct and for suspicious insider - intrigue that may have destabilized the country, it is this period that warrants attention.

When he ascended the throne he found himself absolute lo rd of Syria, Phoenicia, Egypt and the Egyptian Sudan as far south as Napata. His great ancestor Thothmes III had conquered the world, as known to the Egyptians, for him - E. A. W. Budge ( Tutankhamen: Amenism, Atenism, and Egyptian Monotheism ) Amenhotep III is actually depicted seated in the distinctive ark of the sun god, thus identifying himself as the god while he was still alive! Furthermore, the following carvings depict the king and the divine statuary of Amen both being carried alongside sacred arks. This was a truly remarkable statement. No longer was Amenhotep III to be regarded as just a mere agent of the gods. Without prevarication, he was announcing to all those present that he was now to be regarded as a living god. Under normal circumstances, on ly upon death could a pharaoh thus become deified...By openly declaring himself a god, he was now on an equal standing with Amen himself. Additional new material pertaining to Amenhotep‘s deification whilst alive has emerged over the past few years. Astonish ingly, they depict scenes of him worshipping figures of himself - Lorraine Evans ( Kingdom of the Ark ) ...the religious revolution which seems to have been inaugurated by Amenhetep III, at the instance of his wife Queen Ti, and was certainly carried on with increasing vigour by their son, Amenhetep IV, who believed that he was an incarnation of Aten, the god of the Solar Disk. Their discussions gave many people an entirely false idea of the character of Amenhetep IV, and of the nature of the cult of Aten. Th is king was described as a reformer, an individualist, and an idealist and a pacifist; but he was a reformer who initiated no permanent reform, an individualist who diverted the revenues of the gods of his country to his own uses, an idealist who followed the cult of the material, and a pacifist who lost Egypt's Asiatic Empire. His \"Teaching\" proclaimed the \"oneness\" of Aten, which has been compared to the monotheism of Christian nations; but for centuries before his time the priesthoods of Heliopolis, Memp his, Hermopolis and Thebes had proclaimed this self - same oneness to be the chief attribute of their gods - E. A. W. Budge ( Tutankhamen: Amenism, Atenism, and Egyptian Monotheism ) For all his magnificence, there was something \"off\" with this pharaoh who all owed his wife of common birth so much control over him and his country.

The situation becomes more alarming if we believe the evidence th at seems to indicate that Amenhotep III ruled alongside his son Akhenaton for many years. If this is so then we can be absolutely certain that it was Queen Tiye calling the shots.

Amenhotep the Magnificent, given to luxury and overindulgence, was the only pharaoh who had himself portrayed in female clothes...Cyril Aldred, in an issue of the Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (February 1957), reproduced such a sculpture of \"Amenhotep III in his old age wearing a type of gown usually worn by women\" - Immanuel Velikovsky ( Oedipus and Akhenaton ) With such a \"wise\" Solomon ruling the land it was not that difficult for a conniving and power - mad woman of low birth to get her w ay. We wonder, given Doctor Velikovsky's statement, what modern - day Jews and Christians would think if it was revealed to them that their illustrious King Solomon was a transvestite. Ti...a private individual, apparently of no high rank or social position...it is clear that before the marriage of their daughter to Amenhetep III they were humble folk...there is no doubt that Ti was a very remarkable woman and that her influence over her husband was very great. Her name appears in the inscriptions side by side with that of her husband, a fact which proves that he acknowledged her authority as co - ruler with himself; and she assisted at public functions and in acts of ceremonial worship in a manner unknown to queens in Egypt before her time. Her power inside the palac e and in the country generally was very great, and there is evidence that the king's orders, both private and public, were only issued after she had sanctioned them - E. A. Wallis Budge ( Tutankhamen: Amenism, Atenism and Egyptian Monotheism, 1923) Archaeol ogists have long puzzled over the rough condition of Tiye's burial. As one of the most prominent and powerful queens ever they cannot understand why there was so little pomp and ceremony after her demise. Her parents were given the most sumptuous tombs with the exception of that of Tutankhamen, and even her servants had excellent mortuary accommodations. Indeed, Tiye's remains have not been found. In her place the body of Smenkhare (Akhenaton's younger brother) was discovered. His body appeared to have b een treated relatively reverently. W e can estimate why Tiye received no reverent internment or tomb of finery given the state Egypt and its people were in after her great and holy husband and son had finished their reigns. It seems that the good folk of Eg ypt decided that the Valley of the Kings was too good a place for her. Despite Amenhotep III's gender peculiarities, he and his wife Tiye had six children in all and it was their first son Tuthmosis (Akhenaton's elder brother) who was favored as next phara oh by Amenhotep III. The young boy died mysteriously and so it was Akhenaton (also known as Amenhotep IV or, in Greek, as Amenophis Amenhotep III - Prototype of the biblical Solomon. A decadent Atonist his title was \"The Dazzling Sun D isk of All the Land\" "},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"IV) who became pharaoh. Strangely, Akhenaton does not appear in the various portraits of his father and the rest of his brot hers and sisters. This fact tends to confirm that Akhenaton was not the favorite of his father. He may even have been shunned by his family in the early years. He not only appears to be the proverbial \"ugly duckling\" but also something of an unwanted black - sheep shunted from place to place. Revisionist historian Immanuel Velikovsky, who was pretty sure that Akhenaton had an incestuous relationship with Tiye, his mother, writes of the matter in Oedipus and Akhnaton: Akhnaton was a stranger to Thebes and Egypt when he assumed royal power there. He had spent his childhood and youth abroad, either in Syria or in wandering from country to country and from court to court in the lands of the Middle East. His name is never mentioned in the many inscriptions of Amenhotep III, although of the prince - heir to the throne such mention would be expected. He and his father are never pictured together...Amenhotep had himself depicted together with his wife and daughters in enormously oversized figures, but no son was ever represented in this or any other family portrait. In the tomb of Yuya and Tuya, parents of Queen Tiye, there were mortuary gifts from the king and queen and their daughters, but none from Akhnaton. Even the mere existence of Akhnaton is nowhere hinted at during the re ign of his father. Akhenaton: \"Inherited the throne on a fluke of genetic roulette. Sickly as a child and disfigured as an adult...He held court with his beautiful wife, Nefertiti. His two passions were reforming Egypt‘s religion and its writing system\" - Le onard Schlain ( The Alphabet Versus the Goddess ) Given the close rapport between the Tuthmosside pharaohs and Levites of Avaris we can guess with whom Akhenaton spent his growing years. W e suggest that Akhenaton (the biblical Moses) was more at home with th ese strange Levites whose beliefs so differed from other Egyptians. Given that his mother Tiye was an Israelite, and that his father's step - parents were also, it is not a stretch to conceive where the young king was sojourning during those years of absence ."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28 . Nefertiti - Queen of Aton Despite being one of ancient Egypt's most famous faces, Nefertiti's origins are unknown - Dr. Joann Fletcher ( The Search for Nefertiti ) It was Nefertiti and not Akhenaton who should have been pharaoh after the demi se of the deranged and decadent Amenhotep III. She certainly had more right to rule being the legitimate daughter of the \"Great Royal W ife\" Sitamun, the first queen of Amenhotep III. It was due to the clever intrigues of Tiye that Akhenaton became king of Egypt. Tiye arranged his marriage to Nefertiti whose name meant \"the beautiful one is come.\" It was through this famed marriage that Akhenaton gained the right to rule over Egypt. It is our opinion - even after noting the dearth of information about her - that Nefertiti was of Irish ancestry. The heiress, great in the palace, fair of face, adorned with the double plumes, mistress of happiness...the Lady of Two Lands - Nefertiti.

It is that of a Northerner; it is a Nordic type - ibid Nefertiti's name, \"A Beautiful Woman Comes,\" does not contain the noble designation normally found in the birth names of high - ranking Egyptians...This unconventional designation, coupled with the complete absence of family history, suggests that Nefertiti may not have been a native Egyptian...An important indication that Nefertiti was indeed of foreign extraction is the bust in the Berlin Museum. The fair - skinned woman it depicts is clearly not of North African origin, but markedly European - Graham Philips ( Act of God ) Nefertiti's characteristically pale complexion and aquiline features alert us to her Western origins. Moreover , author and historian Lorraine Evans has, in her fine book Kingdom of the Ark , recently confirmed the old Irish legend that spoke of Scota, a pharaoh's daughter, arriving (after the death of Akhenaton) to live, die, and be interred, in Ireland. This queen of Egypt gave her name to Scotland. Evans has shown that Scota was none other than Meritaten (Meri Aton \"beloved of Aton\"), the eldest daughter of Akhenaton and Nefertiti.

Queen Tea Tephi (Milesian Queen) lies near th e hill of Tara while, according to Christian legend, the great biblical patriarch Jeremiah lies buried at Lough Crew. It is the mission of our work to explain what the fascination with Ireland was all about. The answer turns the tables of accepted history upside - down. Although Lorraine Evans offers no coherent reason for the anomaly, we suggest that it was because her ancestors came from there. Meritaten (Scota) was merely journeying home. (See Volume One for more on this subject) W e believe that the promin ent Egyptologists have gone to great lengths to obscure Nefertiti's true ancestry just as they have gone to greater lengths to paint the self - obsessed Akhenaton as a semi - enlightened pacifist and minister of truth. Many sources admit that Nefertiti eventua lly faded from the scene but suggest that was merely due to an identity change. Nefertiti - An Irish Princess? Perhaps.

A few scholars insist that the Pharaoh Smenkhare was Nefertiti and not the younger brother of Akhenaton. Although this may indeed be the case we need to remain cautious since this rather bizarre conjecture may merely be a designed to obscure the fact that Nefertiti was cast aside by the hardcore Atonist priestarchy due to her eventual rejection of both Aton and her husband's ideology that had brought ruin to the land. One of the strongest exponents of this theory is the archaeologist, Dr. Joa nn Fletcher, who believes that Nefertiti's body has been discovered in the famous Valley of the Kings. Her investigations led her to believe the queen's corpse was one of three discovered in 1898. Three mummified bodies were discovered by the team of Frenc h Egyptologist, Victor Clement Georges Philippe Loret, within a side chamber of the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep II. The pharaoh was discovered in this tomb that had been robbed in times past. It was discovered the same year as the tomb of Tuthmosis III and c lose to the time of the discovery of the tombs of Hatshepsut and Yuya. The body of the young woman thought to be Nefertiti was severely mutilated. She had clearly suffered a malicious murderous attack and may have perished from her wounds. Although these f inds are intriguing, it appears to us that the mummy said to be Nefertiti was of a woman too old to be the great queen of Egypt."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29 . Akhenaton's New World Order Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring li on, seeking whom he may devour - (1 Peter 5:8) Akhenaton (renamed \"Moses\" by later propagandists) was a priest of the Cult of the Sun and the controller of the \"Brotherhood of the Snake.\" The god he worshipped was Aton (also Aten, Adon, or Adonai). Being a deranged and obsessed megalomaniac, Akhenaten decided to do what no previous pharaoh had thought of let alone dared . He forcibly abolished the worship of all other gods in Egypt and curtailed financial support of the temples and priests. Apparently, it wa s his intention to forbid pantheism in favor of monotheism. But his concern was not, as has been insinuated by academic sycophants, to spiritualize the country. In effect, it was to de - spiritualize it. His demented concern was to have the god of his Levit ical family be everyone's god. Few in Egypt shared his sentiments or thought this was a good idea. He had support only from other members of his family, from henchmen and court guards from foreign parts hired to protect him, and from certain Hyksos sun pri ests at Heliopolis, Avaris, and Memphis. These priests of the Delta's Solar Cult appear to have had a hand in electing the pompous king to his elevated but much misused office. Certainly, as the old historians have written, it was at the city of Heliopolis that \"Moses\" received his education, or shall we say his indoctrination . An examination of their respective religious beliefs makes it clear that Moses and Akhenaten should not be looked upon, as has been largely the case, as rivals but as the same person - Ahmed Osman ( Moses and Akhenaton ) Manetho states that Moses received his priestly education and learned all the wisdom of the Meritaten (Merit Aton).

A story survived in Egypt during Roman times which also linked Moses with the city - Graham Philips ( Act of God ) The actions of both Thutmosis IV and Amenhotep III must have made a tremendous impression on Akhenaten before he came to the throne...Akhenaten‘s devotion to and preoccupation with the sun disc - the Aten, c ertainly had its origins in the eventful last decade of his father‘s rule - Lorraine Evans ( Kingdom of the Ark ) This connection to Heliopolis can be explained once we consider the theory of revisionist author Ralph Ellis who (following on from the nineteen th century scholar Donald MacKenzie) believes Heliopolis to have been dominated by the Hyksos kings. Authors W illiam Bramley and Laurence Gardner define these kings as part of the ancient \"Dragon Bloodline.\" The Hyksos were none other than the biblical Lev ites. The Hyksos lived largely in the Delta region with only nominal control over Upper Egypt. Gradually a new native Egyptian power base was consolidated around the city of Thebes (Luxor) and an independence movement gained in strength. The Hyksos period came to an end around 1567 BC when they were eventually defeated by this new upsurgent power and the New Kingdom was born - Adrian G. Gilbert ( Magi: The Quest for a Secret Tradition ) Some scholars, as early as Josephus, have associated the Semitic Hyksos w ith the ancient Hebrews, seeing their departure from Egypt as the story retold in the Exodus. Notably, Canaanite/Hebrew names occur among the Hyksos - (Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia) If Akhenaton (and his family before him) was of the Hyksos bloodline, the n his bizarre and sacrilegious actions would make a great deal of sense. But it should be realized, in any case, that Akhenaton was not the legitimate heir to the throne of Egypt. His mother Tiye was not of Egyptian blood and was not acknowledged as being a spiritual \"daughter\" of the god Amen - Ra, that a female had to be in order to have legal rights to the throne. Since Tiye did not possess this right, her son Akhenaton did not either.

Nevertheless, Akhenaton certainly was not. Ergo, when he and his cult of Levite followers were deposed they naturally foun d it expedient to obscure their identity (\"Israelites,\" \"Judites,\" \"Levites\") and not openly proclaim or emphasize their relationship to Egypt. Historians have followed suit so it is only now, in relatively recent times, that the truth about the origins of the Judites and Levites has surfaced. Akhenaton - The biblical Moses Expelled from Egypt with his Atonist Priests he led the Levites to new lands. His descendants set about the rulership of the world to replace their lost thrones in Egypt Akhenaton frequently emphasized that he, and he alone, was the go - between for this new divine life of Egypt.

He was raised by Tey, the wife of Tiye‘s brother. She was a Levite. Amenhotep was later educated at Helio polis and, as a teenager, lived in Thebes. ...his new religion...had many similarities with the solar worship which had developed in the lower end of the Eastern Delta...it was there that he lived and was educated - Ahmed Osman ( Moses and Akhenaton ) The first co terie of W estern \"Egyptologists\" (W eigall, Maspero, Breasted, Petrie, Carter, Grafton Smith, Anthes, Lange, and others) most of who were under aristocratic and even royal patronage, habitually described Akhenaton and his regency in glowing terms. They kick - started the cult of \"Akhenaton the Good,\" \"Akhenaton the Shelley,\" \"Akhenaton the Christ\" of Egypt, in motion. There is barely a scholar of repute who has dissented from this skewed consensus. Author Joann Fletcher describes the manner in which prominent archaeologist and antiquarian Arthur W eigall portrayed the psychopathic demagogue whom he, and so many other experts, found so worthy of adoration: As the first to write a biography of the king, he considered him a complete pacifist with a 'conscientious o bjection to warfare,' and 'not only a Christ, but a nineteenth - century Romantic, with a touch of Hamlet thrown in for good measure - Dr. Joann Fletcher ( The Search for Nefertiti ) If this were a new religion, invented to satisfy our modern scientific concep tions, we could not find a flaw in the correctness of its view of the energy of the solar system. How much Akhenaton understood we cannot say, but he had certainly bounded forward in his views and symbolism to a position which we cannot logically improve u pon at the present day. No rag of superstition or of falsity can be found clinging to this new worship evolved out of the old Aton of Heliopolis, the sole lord or Adon of the Universe - Professor Flinders Petrie (Scottish Archaeologist) No such grand theol ogy had ever appeared in the world before, so far as we know - ibid ... a god - intoxicated man - James Henry Breasted (Egyptologist, archaeologist) ...the first example of the scientific mind - H.

In recent years he has been described by such names as \"great idealist,\" \"great reformer,\" the \"world's first revolutionist,\" the \"first individual in human history,\" etc. But, in view of the known facts of history, and Dr. Elliot Smith' s remarks quoted above on the distortion of the skull of Amenhetep IV, we are fully justified in wondering with Dr. Hall if the king \"was not really half insane\" - E.

Their discussions gave many people an entirely false idea of the character of Amenhetep IV, and of the nature of the cult of Aten. This king was described as a reformer, an individualist, and an idealist and a pacifist; but he was a reformer who initiated no permanent reform, an individualist who diverted the revenues of the gods of his country to his own uses, an idealist who followed the cult of the material, and a pacifist who lost Egypt's A siatic Empire. His \"Teaching\" proclaimed the \"oneness\" of Aten, which has been compared to the monotheism of Christian nations; but for centuries before his time the priesthoods of Heliopolis, Memphis, Hermopolis and Thebes had proclaimed this self - same on eness to be the chief attribute of their gods - E.

Did they attempt to oust this \"Lep er Messiah\" whom they referred to as the \"cripple,\" the \"great villain,\" and \"heretic king?\" Yes, they most certainly did.

There can be no doubt that Akhenaton's policies created immense social problems, which were only resolved when the old gods were restored upon his death.

With the vast majority of Egyptian people worshipping a highly personal mixture of regional deities and family based cults, the gods would almost certainly be missed. The shift fro m visual gods to an abstract concept like the Aten was perhaps a fundamental error on Akhenaton‘s part, and his faith was misplaced. He was rejected by later generations as not having been a legitimate king, and came to be referred to in terms such as ̳tha t enemy Akhenaton‘ - Lorraine Evans ( Kingdom of the Ark ) Akhenaton had already levied a sacred tax on the country and had set up numerous forced labor projects for the construction of the Theban temples as well as other temples to Aten in the rest of the c ountry.

After the reign of Akhenaton collapsed, the throne was passed to Smenkhare and then Tutankhamun who, renouncing the worship of Aton, ret urned the reigns of power back to the Amenist priesthood. After the untimely death of Tutankhamun his uncle Aye (who had also apparently renounced Aton) became pharaoh. He reigned for approximately four years before being removed by Heremheb. When it looke d as if things were going too slowly, or that the Atonists would try to re - establish their despotism, Pharaoh Heremheb was compelled to seize the throne of Egypt with the assistance of the military. He (and later Ramses I, Seti I, and Ramses II) oversaw th e Atonists' gradual removal from positions of power, at least in the major cities and provinces. Heremheb was married to a sister of Nefertiti but was not of the Cult of Aton.

It is not by chance that Pharaohs Heremheb, Rameses II, and Seti I are frequently depicted as evil tyrants in the various Hollywood movie accounts of the biblical exodus.

Amen - Ra: \"The Hidden One.\" One of the earliest Egyptian gods. Returned to prominence after the first expu lsion of the Hyksos, but was later replaced by Aton. In the past, the historians Manetho, Josephus, and Strabo, proclaimed the wandering Israelite tribes to be intimately connected with the pharaonic dynasties of Egypt. Nowadays, a few researchers carryi ng on the revisionist work of Karl Abrahams, Sigmund Freud, Immanuel Velikovsky, and Comyns Beaumont, help us to understand where the mysterious people of the bible came from. W hat stands out from their discoveries is the level of mythmongering and decepti on involved in the bible's compilation. Most importantly, we discover that the Israelites were certainly not impoverished oppressed slaves as most of the world has been expertly conditioned to believe. The chiefs of the so - called \"Israelites\" had been phar aohs themselves and were related to, and descended from, the Hyksos pharaohs of the 13th dynasty. Their great capitals were Memphis and Avaris. Avaris was later renamed Pi - Rameses but had been known as Zaru and Zion. It was situated in the \"Goshen\" of the bible, in the Eastern zone of the Nile Delta. Suggestively, it was the city where Akhenaton had grown up and been educated. The Atonist coterie, who were expelled along with Akhenaton were, like the pharaoh himself, members of this Hyksos dynasty of wealth y and powerful kings and priests. Among the greatest riddles of Jewish prehistoric times is that concerning the antecedents of the Levites. They are said to have been derived from one of the twelve tribes of Israel, the tribe of Levi, but no tradition has ever ventured to pronounce on where that tribe originally dwelt or what portion of the conquered country of Canaan had been allotted to it. They occupied the most important priestly positions, but yet they were distinguished from the priests.

And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be br oken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they too k him for a prophet - (Matt 21:42) Akhenaton was the figurative \"missing cornerstone\" (or capstone) that the builders (Egyptians) rejected. (See Psalms 118, and Matthew 21:42). It is Akhenaton and his Heliopolitan Solar Church that were cast out from the l and of Egypt and banished to the wilderness (the rest of the world). Since that time Egypt has been despised by the descendants of the Atonists who have perpetually worked to obscure its history and significance. The pharaohs of later periods were despised and when the chance came to retaliate, the Atonists (\"Christians\") gleefully burned the Library of Alexandria to the ground and murdered Hypatia, the prophetess of that great city who was exposing them. The symbols used in art to signify the banishment of Akhenaton and his coterie are many. They include the pyramid with broken or cracked stones, or with a missing capstone. Other figurative motifs include dismemberment and castration, and broken columns or pillars. (See Shakespeare's King Lear , or the Arthu rian Legends, stories of Christ, and Dionysus, etc). Broken or lost crowns, the onset of madness that leads to roving abroad (as in King Lear), being cast adrift upon the seas, and having eyes put out or treasures taken, etc, have also been used as sub textual devices alluding to the case of Akhenaton. Indeed, the bible is replete with veiled references to this historical event. After being humiliated and banished to the eastern wilderness these so - called \"Monotheists\" did not just disappear. They left E gypt with all their wealth and moved (if we are to believe it) North - Eastward toward Palestine, making their way to the mountains of Sinai.

As we assert, the biblical Is raelites were followers of renegade Akhenaton, the biblical Moses. Their powerful descendants that have sought to keep this fact from the world. The religion of ancient Israel, like those of most ancient Near Eastern societies, centered on a Temple, served by a caste of priests, who sacrificed offerings to their god. Among the Children of Israel, priests claimed descent from Aaron of the tribe of Levi, and were believed to have been chosen by God to serve God in the Tabernacle during Israel's wanderings in the desert...In ancient Israel...the institution of the priesthood was closely tied with the monarchy...At first, Samuel (who may be considered the last judge, or the first prophet) anointed Saul of the tribe of Benjamin; later he anointed David of the tribe o f Judah, and established the House of David as the definitive royal line - (Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia, on the Pharisees) It becomes rather obvious to us that like Freud, Osman, Ellis, and Gadalla are on the right track with their revisionist theori es. One anecdote in the scriptures that obliquely suggests the illustrious status of the “Israelites” (the “chosen people”) concerns the standard that Moses erected after departure from Egypt. This standard was in the shape of a \"Brazen Serpent\" (Hebrew, N ehushtan ). This device was, in fact, a cross upon which hung a serpent. The cross of Christianity dates from the time of the Levites and Israelites, the followers of Akhenaton. The Mosaic priests who used this emblem were known as \"Naassians,\" and this ter m is reminiscent of the Gaelic \"Naddreds\" (meaning \"Serpent Priests\") and the Hindi \"Nagas\" (meaning Seti I - the great pharaoh of the 19th dynasty (and of the biblical exodus) who, like Heremheb before him, vanq uished the monstrous Cult of Aton.

The bible relates that this priestarchy, that we consider Atonist, was eventually eradicated. However, we see no reason to accept the b ible's word on this matter. Indeed, we believe the later Grecian and Roman usages and permutations of the serpent and staff motif, particularly with figures such as Hermes, Asclepius, Dionysus, date from the time of the Atonists. In any case, the symbol is extremely ancient. It represented the powerful Stellar Cults of the world, the healers, adepts, and keepers of hermetic mysteries. Also known as the \"Caduceus of Hermes,\" it is a symbol of the Brotherhood of the Snake. This very device is used today by th e medical corporations of the world. The Old Testament tells us that Moses and his brother Aaron were sent by Jehovah to the unnamed pharaoh to plead for the release of the \"chosen people.\" W hile they are debating with pharaoh and his priests, Moses and A aron perform a strange magical trick. Suggestively, they do this regardless of the prohibition against performing magic. Chapter 7 of the Book of Exodus tells us wha t is alleged to have occurred: And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they. And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy ro d, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh al so called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.

This pharaoh was not intent on holding the Israelites (Atonists). On the contrary, he was expelling them and eager to do anything to make sure they trouble Egypt no more.

In any case, the mention of the \"Brazen Serpent\" serves to alert us to the true identity of the \"Israelites.\" The Egyptian pharaohs (like the Chines e emperors) used the symbol of royalty to denote themselves. There is no way that a follower of Jehovah (as put before us) would be making use of such a \"pagan\" device. And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much pe ople of Israel died. Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.

W e find that they were not oppressed captives or slaves, and that they were one and the same people as the so - called \"Hyk sos Kings.\" The Hyksos were known to be a strange and violent race who had ruled in Egypt for 300 years from the 13th dynasty down to the beginning of the 18th when they were finally confronted and expelled. The lie of Jewish slavery had already been refut ed by top Jewish historians but the mystery of their actual status was rarely probed. If they were not captives or slaves then what were they? And why the falsification?

The Thirteenth Dynasty was amongst the most disrupted of all Egypt‘s lines of kings; few of the rulers survived long enough to leave substantial evidences of their reigns behind them. Invaders now appeared in the north of the country and established an independent kingship, outwardly Egyptian in many of its f orms but actually alien to all that the Egyptians held sacred - Michael Rice ( Who’s Who in Ancient Egypt ) Eventually, the Hyksos moved northwards and overran Memphis. They established their first main capital there. They later moved to Avaris that, accordi ng to biblical tradition, was the same city occupied by the Levite followers of Moses. Avaris was basically a garrison town held by over a quarter of a million men in arms. Avaris was also known as Zoan. This latter term is close to Zion. If it is the same word then the constant references by Jews to the time of \"Zion\" refer to the dynasty of the despotic Hyksos people to whom they were related. According to Ralph Ellis the patriarch known as Abraham (from Ab'ram - meaning \"of Ra the Father \") was the first pharaoh of these despised Hyksos people. His sister and wife Sarah eventually married the pharaoh of Southern Egypt forming a union with that rival and more native house. This alliance would have resulted in future mixed marriages (like Amenhotep III's wit h Tiye and Yuya with Asenath, etc), and to claims to the throne from foreign - blooded heirs.

This same king built a city named Abari s or Avaris by the Egyptians on a site he discovered...selecting a strategic post where he could dominate the Egyptians and check the Syrians. Abaris was founded with strong walls and here Salatis maintained a garrison of 400,000 men, whence he repaired ev ery summer from Memphis, where he principally dwelt...the Hyksos overlordship lasted for 511 years when they were driven away after a long and bitter war - Comyns Beaumont ( Britain - Key to World History ) The migrations mentioned in the Bible can be situated during this era of foreign domination of Egypt, an outward - looking epoch, in vivid contrast to the previous period of \"splendid isolation.\" Groups of pre - Israelites, caught up in the flux of Semitic tribal displacements, went down from Canaan toward the s outhwest and settled on the edges of the eastern Delta in the steppe region near Pithom, known in Genesis as the \"land of Goshen\"...Several texts dating from the reign of Thutmosis III mention the ̳Apiru,‘ implying their presence in Egypt toward the middle o f the fifteenth century BCE - Joseph Meleze Modrzejewski ( The Jews of Egypt: From Rameses II to Emperor Hadrian ) Allegedly, another Egyptian term for the Hyksos was Shasu. This term meant \"Shepherds,\" and we might note how frequently this term is employed in the bible. The great scholar Gerald Massey wrote of the Shasu and identified them as proto - Israelites: The people of Ysiraal in this inscription are identified by the Pharaoh with the nomads of the Edomite Shasu or shepherds, and are classed by him with the confederate marauders who invaded Egypt with the Libu, and were defeated with huge slaughter at the battle of Procepis (Pa - ar - shep, which is also recorded on the monuments. They"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"were a tribe or totemic community of cattle - keepers, one of ―the tribes o f the Shasu from the land of Aduma‖ who went down into Egypt in search of grazing ground to find sustenance for their herds in the eastern region of the Delta. At this very time, when the people of Ysiraal and their seed were being ―wiped out‖ or annihilat ed as the Israelites in Syria, there was an exodus of the Edomite Shasu which has been pressed into the service of false theory on behalf of biblical ―history‖. These tribes had considered the eastern region of the Delta, as far as Zoan, to be their own po ssession, until they were driven out by Seti I - Gerald Massey ( Egypt: Light of the World ) However, even though the term \"Shepherd Kings\" was attributed to the Hyksos it may not have been a correct attribution. Manetho, the third century Greco - Egyptian historian who first applied the term is believed to have mistranslated heqau - khasut that allegedly means \"rulers of foreign lands.\" It has also been translated as meaning \"people from the mountains\" or \"people of the pyramids.\" Manetho's description gives the impression that the Hyksos were not from Egypt, but from outside. This is the widely held view. Author Ralph Ellis, however, prefers to believe that the Hyksos were native Egyptians from the outset and that the term \"foreigners\" simply referred men fr om Lower Egypt. It is quite true that Egypt was divided into two zones (known as Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt) and was often ruled by rival pharaohs. In any case, scholars differ widely over the origins of the Hyksos. They were reputed to be excellent horse men and to be expert with the use of chariots and bows. They were allegedly technically inventive. The buildings and art attributed to them is most likely not of their own invention. It belongs to the native Egyptian craftsmen and artists whose skills had been honed for millennia. Although the Hyksos were not unskilled, it is likely that they have been awarded the credit for inventions and constructions actually created by skilled natives working at their direction. Moreover, the presence of these foreigner s would have spurred a nationalistic spirit among native Egyptians and the sublimated passion could certainly have provided the inspiration and impetus for refreshed artistic expressiveness Jesus Christ - the basis of the Christian religion. He was referred to as \"the Shepherd.\" Did this have to do with the fact that he was a descended from the pharaohs, known as the \"Shepherd Kings?\" Did it have to do with him being a master whose teachings were being carried over from the Age of Aries into that of Pisces?"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"during the period of Hyksos dominion. In any case, some of the artwork discovered at Hyksos sites has been traced to the Minoan cultur e of Crete. The Cretans and Hyksos are believed to have been related by a few Egyptologists. Some scholars imagine the Hyksos to have been horseback riding Hittites while others deem them Greeks, Syrians, Amorites, Minoans, Scythians, Hurrians, or even Trojans. One fact that suggests that the Hyksos were long term inhabitants of Egypt, rather than invaders, is their veneration of the ancient god Set (Seth, Sutekh, Seteh, or Seb) who had dominion over Lower (Northern) Egypt. During the time of the Hyksos , Set became part of the Heliopolitan Ennead . Set was god of the dark places, wild weather, and of the inhospitable red desert burned by the sun called Tesherit . This word means \"red lands.\" Red was the color of Set, so it is interesting that this color sh ould be frequently and conspicuously employed by corporations and governments (red squares, St. George's Red Cross, Red Coats, red tape, red carpets, red ribbons, red military stripes and lapels, red roses, etc). Some researchers point to this as evidence that the Hyksos were fair - complexioned westerners known as \"Edomites.\" In any case, Set was considered a scheming deity who sought to overthrow the reign and sovereignty of his brother Osiris. After Set murdered Osiris he was sought out by Horus (the son o f Osiris and Isis) who wounded him in the groin with a spear. Set managed to spear out one of Horus‟ eyes but was ultimately overthrown by the god of light. Many scholars have agreed that the story of the combat between Horus and Set encapsulates the hist orical antipathy and tribulations between the native Egyptians and Hyksos invaders. In this case it is not that Set was evil but that he was the god adopted by the evil ones who chose to worship him. This is why Set would have been deemed a god of darkness in the age after the Hyksos were defeated and removed from power. Lord Set - An ancient god of the earth, akin to the Irish stag god Herne, and Hindu Shiva. His color was red and men will still say they \"saw red\" after becoming enraged. The red cross of England comes from his worship as do the many other \"red\" insignias to be found employed by governments and religious bodies.

These were the lands ruled over by Set"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Since Set opposed Osiris and Horus, the gods of light, scholars question why the Hyksos and Levites of the Solar Cult worshipped him. The answer has to do with the metaphysical properties of light. Set represented the dark side of the sun and of light. But he was a solar god nevertheless. Egyptian pantheons were dualistic and balanced. There were gods of light and gods of darkness. There were gods of the overworld and the underworld, of this world and of the next. In Egyptian, Set's name is believed to mean \"great in strength.\" The Egyptian word setam meant \"hate\" and \"opposition,\" while the word shetam meant \"fight.\" In any case, he is one of Egyp t‟s oldest deities, worshipped centuries before the Hyksos arrived. Indeed, it is possibly due to Set's eventual connection with the hated Hyksos that he was not completely assimilated into the pantheon of Egyptian gods but always regarded as a god apart f rom the main pantheon. Finally, after the Hyksos Kings had been expelled, Set was considered the god of evil or, more specifically, of the evil ones . In fact, the true god of evil in Egypt was not Set but Apep or, more correctly, Apophis. This serpentine g od ruled the underworld and hindered the god Ra when he attempted to traverse the forbidding regions of the nekyia. The protector of the sun god was none other than Set who attacked and overcame the demonic Apophis. So it is clear to students of Egyptian o ccultism that Set was not an easily defined one - dimensional god. To some minds he is evil and to others a god possessed of abilities that keep true evil at bay. Set was often depicted kneeling and we get the English words set and seat from this name. Somet hing about Set reminds us of the Hindu god Shiva. Set has been considered the Egyptian equivalent of the Christian Satan, though we stress that Set was a much more complex archetype than the Christian version. For those who muse on the Irish (or Gothic and Nordic) origins of the Hyksos, it is interesting to note that the term Set may derive from Ztak or Ztek , meaning \"stag.\" As we show in Volume One, the horned stag god was venerated for millennia by the Irish Gaels, the Goths, the Teutons, and Phoenicians. The Anglo - Saxon name Sid may come from Set, and the Gaelic word Sidhe meaning “Faerie Folk” is not far off. Indeed, the hieroglyph for the god Set contains a semi - circular mound no different than an Irish burial cairn. His animal totem is thought to be th e giraffe. This animal was believed to have possessed no vocal chords. W hen giraffes are taken down by lions they utter no sound.

W e can simply state that Set was an important symbol both within Egyptian religion and the occult tradition and that he has special significance astrologically and alchemically. At the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty, during t he reign of Pharaoh Ahmose I ( Aahmes, Amasis, or Amos ), the majority of the Hyksos people were finally routed and expelled from Egypt. By way of emphatic negotiation and financial incentive, the Theban pharaoh succeeded in bringing their cruel and destruct ive 300 - year rule to an end. Pharaoh Ahmose was directed by the El Kab family descended from early Egyptian feudal lords. The ancient texts describe his great victories and his own stature: Ahmes was quite a youth - he tells us that he was \"too young to ha ve a wife\" - when he fought on foot behind the chariot of the Pharaoh.

It refers to the mass expulsion of the Hyksos people under the reign of Ahmose I (1575 - 1550 BC) and also to the removal of the renegade Pharaoh Akhenaton at the end of the 18th d ynasty. This first exodus of the Hyksos was an immense affair and took a long time to complete. The Hyksos cities such as Memphis and Avaris were evacuated and the quarter of a million inhabitants from this Avaris plus those from other towns and cities lef t a trail of ruin in their wake. Pharaoh Ahmose I, routing the Hyksos & their Dragon Court Although the process of removal was slow, and ev en though Ahmose was compelled to pay an enormous amount of money to hasten the departure of his powerful enemies, Egypt was liberated during his regency. Hyksos historian Ralph Ellis describes the great event for us: This was a huge event at the time, wit h some 240,000 people fleeing Egypt, according to Manetho (possibly 240,000 families, depending on which interpretation is placed on the style of the text). This is certainly the sort of event that was likely to become ingrained in the psyche, rather than the flight of a few slaves from captivity - ( Tempest and Exodus ) Thus began an orgy of looting and violence as the departing Hyksos - Israelites stripped the land bare. It was destruction on an unprecedented scale and it prompted the Theban pharaoh, when he saw the ruins of Avaris, to declare that this was not just greed, but avarice! - ibid The departing Hyksos (600,000 according to the Bible) took the wealth of Lower Egypt with them. It was a victory for Esau, but in some respects a hollow one, for the enti re region had been stripped clean; looted for every last coin. Esau visited the town of Avaris, and on seeing the devastation and wanton greed for riches, he declared that this terrible deed should be called from henceforth, Avarice! - ( Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs ) ...there was wholesale looting and the country was in turmoil.

It is quite obvious that this was not the work of a small band of slaves who had given the Egyptians the slip. It could only have been the work of a retreating army, the Hyksos army and the most powerful in the world at that time - ibid I have restored that whic h had been ruined. I raised up that which had gone to pieces formerly, since the Asiatics were in the midst of Avaris of the Northland, and vagabonds were in the midst of them, overthrowing that which had been made. They ruled without Re and did not act by divine command - (Testimony of Pharaoh Hatshepsut. Source, Ancient Near Eastern Texts, by J. b. Pritchard) After dealing with the Hyksos invaders, Ahmose and his men turned south and descended upon the Nubians who had long been the compatriots of the Hyks os and who made it easy for them to take hold in the first place. According to the Jewish lore, Moses was married to a Nubian princess and was therefore the commander of the Nubians. Author Ralph Ellis states that the Nubians were under the control of the Heliopolitans even though they frequent lands in Upper (Southern) Egypt. After forcing back the Nubians and overcoming two Hyksos counter attacks, Ahmose set about restoring the ancient monuments and dilapidated temples and buildings of his country. The re cently discovered Tempest Stele reveals just what a turbulent time it was and how the land of Egypt suffered at the hands of the departing Hyksos and also from the after - effects of storms and rains that expert Ralph Ellis believes were caused by massive vo lcanic eruptions on the Mediterranean island of Santorini. The Tempest Stele confirms that the Hyksos pillaged the land they had once ruled and left with coffers full of treasure. These facts further render laughable the image of god's impoverished, oppres sed, desert - wandering \"chosen people\" presented in the early books of the bible. What we seem to have in the Tempest Stele is not only an account of the biblical plagues, but also an account of the beginning of the Hyksos - Israelite exodus, and how it was o rganized and implemented by the two parties involved in the dispute - Ralph Ellis ( Tempest and Exodus ) The Hyksos can enter tombs just as easily as water can; but whilst the Hyksos can also strip the pyramid casings, overturn the cult statues, open up secr et places to the public and end the bread offerings with ease, water would find this extremely difficult. The Tempest Stele text is actually alluding to the desecration of the sacred temples throughout (Middle) Egypt by the Hyksos - Israelites - ibid ...And the barbarians were among them, destroying buildings, While they governed, not knowing Ra - Manetho ( Ancient Egyptian Historian ) The Hyksos did not have a good reputation among the Egyptians, whose national traditions depicted them as plunderers of cities and temples, cruel and impious barbarians faithful only to their god Seth, that veritable incarnation of evil in the Osiris legend - Joseph Meleze Modrzejewski ( The Jews of Egypt: From Rameses II to Emperor Hadrian )"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Josephus, the patriotic Jewish historian , who believed that the Hyksos were \"the children of Israel\", quoted Manetho as saying that \"they were a people of ignoble race who had confidence to invade our country, which they subdued easily without having to fight a battle.

During the entire period of their dynasty they waged war against the people of Egypt, desiring to exterminate the whole race...The foreigners were called Hyk sos, which signifies 'Shepherd Kings\" - Donald MacKenzie ( Egyptian Myth and Legend, 1907) Records from steles show that Ahmose I may have used slave labor in his restoration work. Later historians may speak of \"slavery\" but the truth of the matter is found not in cruelty and oppression, as we have been lead to believe, but in revenge and justice. Putting his country's enemies and destroyers to work on renovation projects probably seemed appropriate to him and his generals. After the havoc created by the Hyk sos, the Egyptian pharaohs were compelled to be somewhat less tolerant with their enemies and those within their own society who had assisted them. This is the reason for the feats of military conquest in the North (against the Syrians) and in the South (a gainst the Nubians) that we read about occurring under the reigns of several pharaohs, particularly Amenhotep II and Tuthmosis III. Pharaoh Ahmose I and his queen Ah hotep were members of the Lunar Cult which predated the Solar Theocracy by millennia. Thi s cult had a center at Thebes and it was the Thebans who were most oppressed by the regime of the Hyksos. The phoneme Ah (in Ahmose and Ah hotep) was the name of the moon god. The members of the Lunar Cult of Thebes were rivals of the priests of Heliopolis whom they considered little better than the Hyksos. The conflicts in Egypt of which we speak were not merely political strife. They were primarily theological in nature. As moon worship was of greater antiquity in Egypt than sun worship, and was associate d with agricultural rites, the Theban cult must have made popular appeal, and helped to rally the mass of the people to throw off the yoke of the Hyksos Ra and Sutekh worshippers - Donald Mackenzie ( Egyptian Myth and Legend , 1907) When Ahmes began the work of reconstructing the temples, the first gods he honoured were Amon and Ptah - ibid ...in the limestone quarries near Cairo two tablets record that stone was excavated for the great temples at Memphis and Thebes. No reference is made to Heliopolis - ibid ...salvation came from the south. Thebes, hitherto a relatively unimportant provincial centre other than during the Eleventh Dynasty, was now fated to become for centuries the greatest city in the world.

We are told that Moses gave notice to the children of Israel at midnight, that they must take their departure from Egypt the next morning for the promised land...if they constituted the immense number represented, they would have made a column two hundred miles long, arranging the five abreast, and it would have taken several days for all to get started. How, then, could they a ll start the next morning?

W e can now see why this omission occurred. It was an inevitable omission given the fact that Moses was himself a pharaoh. It was imperative that the pharaoh's name be omitted and the date of Moses' exodus with the chosen people be left a mystery. It was imperative that the world did not find out about the earlier exodus under Ahmose I. It was never to be known that the Levites (Atonists) had powerful allies awaiting them in la nds outside Egypt, and perhaps at Tanis in the Eastern Delta region. They were to appear poor wanderers hard pressed by the evil pharaoh. Traditionally, the two periods that scholars assigned to the biblical exodus were 1444 BC, during the time of Pharaohs Tuthmosis III and Amenhotep II (which is too early for Akhenaton and too late for the Hyksos exodus); and 1290 BC during the reign of the mighty Merenptah."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"The Hyksos were Asiatics who filtered into the eastern Egyptian Delta around the middle of the Thir teenth Dynasty taking advantage of a period of internal Egyptian weakness, probably bringing with them and using to their own advantage, the chariot. The Thirteenth Dynasty rulers had moved the capital of the country north to a centrally located town calle d Itjawy near Memphis, near the apex of the Delta. Seizing the kingship, the Hyksos ruled Egypt for over one hundred years, composing the Fifteenth Dynasty. The heterogeneous Sixteenth Dynasty was partly Hyksos, but also composed of local Egyptian rulers w ho had no choice but to go along with their new overlords. This general period of Egyptian weakness and foreign occupation is called the Second Intermediate Period, or more popularly, the Hyksos Period. The local princes in Thebes in the south formed the S eventeenth Dynasty when the Hyksos overran Itjawy and forced the ephemeral rulers there into subservience. These vigorous Theban rulers kept the flame of Egyptian independence alive and finally were able to lead a war of liberation that expelled the Asiati cs. The Hyksos rulers and their military forces were driven from Egypt. Egypt was free, and Ahmose and his successors of the Eighteenth Dynasty could turn to the task of reconstruction. Some historians have linked the biblical story of Joseph with the Hyks os regime - (Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia, on the Hyksos) A New Kingdom poem, from the Prophesies of Nerferti , conveys the fallen state of Egypt under the invaders: Lo, the great no longer rule the land What has been made has been unmade The land is quite perished, no remnant is left The land suffers, none care for it The Sun - Disk is covered It shines not for the people to see One cannot live when clouds conceal All are numb for a lack of it As we can imagine, the Levitical editors of the Babylonian Talmud (and the Torah or Old Testament), the descendants of the tyrannous \"Dragon Court\" of Egypt, have done their best to sweeten their image and tone down the embarrassing facts to the point of invisibility. But despite their patent contempt for ancient Egypt and blustering hyperbole about their own virtue, special destiny, and ridiculously arrogant protestations of being the \"chosen\" of god, the insipid story of their true origins and activities is beginning to be exposed, as are the deceptive interpolations o f conspiring \"historians\" sadly accepted by the masses as fact.

There is not a legitimate Jewish or Gentil e historian alive who endorses the disinformationist accounts concerning the oppression and enslavement of the Jews in Egypt. Additionally, we suspect that the story of the labor of the Jews was concocted so that Jews might sidle up and present themselves as the actual \"builders\" of Josephus' \"foolish pyramids.\" Fortunately, sanity seems to have prevailed, at least in this regard, and the claim has not been made. It could hardly be made since the pyramids, it is thought, were erected in the predynastic age under the regency of Pharaoh Cheops. This pharaoh, who was also known as Khufu, lived between 2589 and 2566 BC, or one thousand years before the Hyksos (Levites) were ever heard of. These controversial revelations, regarding the existence of an Israelite ( Hyksos) dynasty in Egypt, allow us to finally understand why it was that Egyptian leitmotifs are so conspicuous throughout the Judaic (and Christian) religious canon. W e see that they were not only closely affiliated, or even blood - bonded, with the pharaoh s of the eighteenth dynasty, but also with the despotic pharaohs who began their imposter reigns approximately 300 years previously. It is generally reckoned that the Hyksos Pharaoh Apepi II (Apophis) was the last hereditary Dragon King in Egypt, but it wo uld appear that the heritage was perpetuated through the female line into the new dynasty. Even the grave of Ahmose's son Amenhotep I contained a preserved vase cartouche of the daughter of Apophis, which signifies the enmity was not so great between the h ouses as is traditionally supposed - Laurence Gardner ( Genesis of the Grail Kings ) Clearly, it is from their time in Egypt (among the most enlightened peoples of the world) that they became involved with occult knowledge. It is from this time that they had access to enormous physical wealth and from when they began to codify and ritualize the various beliefs that would distinguish them from other religious groups. As vizier, Joseph made many large fortunes, and owned a lot of land in Lower Egypt. He was the richest man in the world at that time from huge returns on his various investments - Ralph Ellis ( Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs ) Regardless of where they originated, it is likely that the Hyksos people had close ties with tribes in Canaan.

Clearly, Jehovah was given them after they had spent time in Egypt and become affiliated with the Atonists. Jehovah is known to this day as Adonai , a word that derives directly from Aton, the god of the sun. Elsewhere in the bible, Moses refers to his god as Jehovah Nissi that means \"Serpent Lord.\" Some scho lars believe Jehovah Nissi to be the equivalent of Dionysus ( Dion Isi or Don Isi ) or of the Phoenician Adonis ( Don Isi ). The reference to a \"Serpent Lord\" not only refers to the solar and stellar priesthoods of Egypt but of Ireland.

The f irst exodus of the Hyksos was, as we have shown, a massive affair, and the departing hordes would certainly have attempted to ingratiate themselves in countries outside Egypt. Scholars believe the Hyksos set up a new capital at Jerusalem, while author Ralp h Ellis believes they were able, during the period of the 22nd dynasty, to maintain a base at Tanis in the North - Eastern Delta region. Evidence suggests that the reconquest of Egypt was never far from their minds. This is why they were happy to send large contingents of armed forces to assist Akhenaton when his troubles began and after his exile. Ralph Ellis speculates that the Hyksos were close relatives of both the Minoans of Crete and the Philistines of Canaan. This theory is endorsed by the authors Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe who have made extensive researches into the Knights Templar and Minoan civilization. There is also evidence that the Hyksos had settlements in Greece and Italy. In any case, although the Atonists might well have been exiles they w ould not have been homeless.

One of the early names for Egypt was Mori . It is quite true that the Hyksos Kings of L ower Egypt bear a striking resemblance to the Amorites. One of the Egyptian words connoting a shepherd was Aamu , or Amu . The inhabitants of the Hyksos capital Avaris were known by this name. Allegedly, the Amorites primarily frequented W estern Babylon, Syr ia, and Canaan, and a few historians believe them to be the main contributors to Babylon's ancient civilization. One of the oldest cities in Sumeria was known as Mari . Professor W addell believed the Amorites traveled by sea to Britain. Perhaps, they came from the W est originally. After all, the term Amorite contains the syllable mor that, like the Latin mare , the French mer, and Gaelic muir , referred to the sea. Like the Phoenicians then, the Amorites may have been seafarers whose ancestral homelands were in the W est. Professor L. A. W addell surmised that the term was taken from the name of an early Sumerian - Babylonian king known as Muru or Muruta . If his title or name meant \"Man of the Sea,\" or \"Sea King,\" it might not be unrelated to Merodach (the supreme god of the Babylonians), to Meroe (one of the oldest cities on the Nile), or to the Merovingian kings of Europe. Childeric I - Fourth king of th e Merovingian dynasty of Europe. Note the lion (Atonist) headdress with solar rays. The syllable mer connotes the sea, but in Egyptian it meant \"pyramid\" and \"the high ones.\" This Whether they were connected to the Hyksos pharaohs or not, the Amorites did, during the latter half of the third century BC and then again during the first cen tury BC, manage to establish their own empire and did rule over the Babylonians after that decadent empire grew weak and fragmented. This experience with political rulership may have given them confidence to move into Egypt when that civilization was at it s weakest. This is what the Amorites are said to have done twice in Mesopotamia. To the Babylonians they were known as the Amurru , to the Sumerians Martu , and to the Egyptians they were the Amar or Amari . Interestingly, their god was one of mountains, volc anoes, and thunder. If the official history on the Amorites is to be trusted this suggests the Amorites were a very ancient people even if they were not as civilized or fixed as the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Egyptians.

Amorites to be the ancestors of the Israelites although the connection cannot be assured due to the dearth of information on the race. The bible refers to the Amorites as mountain or hill dwellers. The mountains of Judea, like Mount Moriah (or perhaps Amoriah ), for instance, were known as the \"mountains of the Amorites\" (see Deut. 1:7, 19, 20). The bible does state that the Amorites were of giant stature. Their king was known as Og, and this is close to the Gaelic Ogma the giant god of strength and wisdom. The bible, however, does not presume kinship between Amorite and Israelite but deems the Amorites to be ancestors of the Canaanites. Nevertheless, there may have been a connection between the biblical Israelites and Amorites since the languages are so similar and since their gods (of volcanoes, mountains, thunder, and storms) are so reminiscent of one another. The myths of the Israelites, after all, do seem preoccupied with mountains, deserts, wildernesses, fulminating gods, whirlwinds, and short - term kingdoms. Most importantly, the connection of the Amorites to the Hyksos is strengthened when we discover that the Amorite goddess, the consort of Amurru, was known as the \"goddess of deserts.\" Assyriologists have discovered accounts that show that the Amorites despaired over their nomadic life of wandering and farming: The MAR.TU who know no grain...The MART.TU who know no house nor town, the boors of the mountains...The MA R.TU who digs up truffles...who does not bend his knees (to cultivate the land), who eats raw meat, who has no house during his lifetime, who is not buried after death - ( Chiera 1934: 58 and 112) The Amorites were fierce warriors who were represented on t he Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, curved or hooked noses, and pointed beards - (Phoenicia.org) For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants - (Deuteronomy 3:11, on the king of the Amorites) It is now generally co nceded that the Hyksos, who invaded and held Egypt in the early part of the second millennium BC, were Semites from Syria...The late Professor W.

Scholar Albert T. Clay believes that the Amorites were the true founders of the Babylonian civilization. He claims that it was during the Amorite Hammurabi Dynasty (25th century BC) that the names of famous \"Babylonian\" gods and heroes appear, such as El, Anu, Ea, Ishtar and Tammuz, Adapa, Anat, Dagan, Molech, Lugal, and Gilgamesh, etc. ...I believe that the Babylonian is a broken down Amorite language which in all periods, due to migration, was influenced by the mother tongue - Albert T. Clay ( The Origin of Biblical Traditions ) Authors Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ), like Ralph E llis, believe they have come across evidence that links the Hyksos to the Minoans of Crete, while author Graham Philips ( The Serpent Grail ) believes the Hyksos to have originated in Mesopotamia. He surmises that their ancestors were a tribe called the Mori (or Mari) who lived on lands West of the Euphrates near the Syrian border. Given the name of this tribe and their location they are probably the same people as the Amorites or were, at least, related to them. According to Philips, around 1750 BC, the Mori were routed from their homeland by the Babylonians. After being ousted they descended upon Northern Egypt and overran the Delta area finally settling on lands in that region for about 300 hundred years. If the Hyksos did indeed come down from Mesopotamia it would make sense that the Egyptians referred to them as \"Desert Dwellers.\" The first of the Hyksos in Egyptian records appear shortly after the collapse of the Mari Kingdom - Graham Philips ( Act of God ) After their successful invasion and accession to t he throne of Egypt, during the 13th dynasty, the Hyksos may have been joined by many more wanderers seeking refuge. Some of these groups may have arrived from the Indus Valley civilization that had suffered the drying up of major rivers. In any case, the f oreign hordes occupied the cities of Memphis and Avaris and were known for their lack of hygiene and immoral ways. Many of the names that were used for them meant \"wanderer,\" \"vagabond,\" or \"shepherd.\" However, after some time in Egypt the women of the for eign migrants were employed as midwives and servants in the great houses.

Indeed, we conclude that the Israelite strain within the Tuthmosside dynasty was that of the Hyksos \"Dragon Court\" and that the two houses had long been intertwined. These alleged Israelites who had bred and multiplied to such an amazing number as to constitute a threat to the Egyptians can only be explained as the descendants of the original Hyksos who had stayed behind 327 years previously, who preferred to be subject to the kings of Egypt rather than march with David to another region - Comyns Beaumont In the Bible, the last pages at the end of the book of Genesis describe Joseph and his descendants as being among the most powerful people in th e world. Joseph had risen to the rank of vizier to the Pharaoh, second only to Pharaoh himself...the historical record also seems to confirm that Joseph reached this exalted position and then went on to establish a line of royal viziers that maintained their elite position for many generations - Ralph Ellis ( Jesus: Last of the Pharaohs ) W e are told that during his time at Sinai, Moses (Akhenaton) was unable to speak directly to his \"Israelite\" cronies. This was due to his alleged inability to speak their lang uage that we are told was “Hebrew.” He engaged his Israelite (Levite) brother Aaron to intercede for him. Researchers have identified this Aaron as the Pharaoh Smenkhare, the son of Akhenaton, although Ralph Ellis believes him to have been Tuthmosis, the b rother of Akhenaton, believed to have died young. Akhenaton's need for an interpreter leaves us thinking that there were some major differences between his people and these Levites even though they were close political affiliates before, during, and after their expulsion. Ralph Ellis believes that Moses was really Tuthmosis, the brother of Akhenaton, known as Aaron in the Old Testament stories. However, we must remember that each pharaoh, each Egyptian king, and probably most high level court dignitaries, h ad several personal names. Pharaohs had five names with two known publicly and three kept secret. Pharaohs had \"throne names\" and doubtlessly had names which they preferred to be called by their closest family members. It is unlikely that these secret name s would ever have been written down or known to the world at large. Therefore, \"Moses\" could still have been a name for Akhenaton. It merely means - \"the son of...\" and may have referred to Akhenaton being the \"Son of Aton,\" exactly what he considered hims elf to be. If we disregard Ellis' theories and choose instead to accept as fact the highly improbable story of Abraham, and his migration into Egypt, we are compelled to acknowledge something of singular importance concerning the virtue of this \"holiest\" o f patriarchs and concerning the claims to virtue of the so - called \"chosen\" people supposed to have descended from his line. W e discover, from the rendition of his life in the Book of Genesis , that this Abraham, upon his arrival at the House of the Pharaoh, lied to all saying that his wife Sarai was in"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"fact his sister . This lie was told by the schemers when they discovered that the pharaoh had taken a personal liking to Sarai. W hen the pharaoh finds out that Sarai is Abraham's good - looking sister he takes he r in marriage and rewards Abraham with considerable wealth. So, for simple material gain this great and holy patriarch palmed off his wife as his sister to the pharaoh of Egypt. And the supposed descendants of this Faginesque swindler dare tell us that the Egyptians were morally suspect. However, the Book of Genesis goes on to relate how terrible god - sent plagues descended upon pharaoh's people and that he finally finds out that he was sorely duped by Abraham, his duplicitous guest. The troubled pharaoh (co nsidered a very evil person by the Jews of later ages) does not jail or kill Abraham but simply banishes him from his sight. (See Genesis 12:18.) Times of famine were common - and it was at a time of famine that Abram and Sarai were said to have set out on their travels again from Haran, making their way south, a journey that was to forge links between this Semitic tribe and the royal house of Egypt, and ensured for Abram's family an enduring place in world history - Ahmed Osman ( Christianity: An Egyptian R eligion ) Abram was well rewarded for the hand in marriage of his ―sister‖ with sheep, oxen, donkeys and servants. The idyll did not last, however. The Bible tells us that ―great plagues‖ descended on the House of Pharaoh because he had married another man‘ s wife, and Pharaoh sent for Abram and asked him: ―What is this thou has done unto me? Why did thou not tell me that she was thy wife? Why saidest thou, she is my sister...now therefore behold my wife, take her, and go thy way - Ahmed Osman ( Christianity: An Egyptian Religion ) The descriptions of Abraham are not uniform: at times he appears as a lonely migrant, at others as a chieftain, head of a large family, or as a warrior. Factual details about the patriarch are difficult to establish - Gerald A. Larue ( W ho Were the Jews? ) The biblical editors (believed to have been working and compiling in Babylon between the sixth and third centuries BC) decided to include this fabulous tale of Abraham and his devious and inexcusable intrigue against the pharaoh, to subt ly cast doubt upon the parentage of a most important person in Jewish history, namely their son Isaac. If Sarai lay with pharaoh on the first night of their wedding ceremony (as was the custom), then could not Isaac of the Jews, of the seed of Abraham, not be of the house of pharaoh instead? It is our belief that this tie probably did exist and that it was covered up by the biblical editors who were under orders from the Cult of Aton as to what to write. It would have seriously weakened the allegiances and ties between the Jews and the Cult of Aton if it was to be realized that there were close bonds to earlier pharaohs. As a result, the connection was downplayed so that the Atonists (those with an intense hated toward Egypt) could maintain the respect and a llegiance of their Jewish servants. They wanted the Jews who followed and served them to develop the same antipathy that they possessed towards their original homeland and the pharaohs of previous dynasties.

The role of Sarai had to be played down as much as possible. The readers of later generations were not to know that she was an honored woman and wife to a pharaoh. So, the story of the Lord appearing to Abraham and giving him the covenant (Genesis 1 5:18) was concocted to make him the more appealing and striking character. Now all eyes would be focused upon Abraham and his Lord and on some vague inexplicable \"covenant.\" Attention would not be on Sarai or Isaac's true father, the suggestively unnamed a nd mightily deceived pharaoh, who was the true father of the so - called \"Twelve Tribes of Israel.\" In the Book of Genesis we are told that Sarai was unable to bear children, which is why she offered up her maid - servant, Hagar, to her husband Abraham.

In short, the deliberate stratagem of avoiding naming important personages, of omittin g and altering times, dates, and sequences of events, of distorting chronologies, and of inserting complete fabrications, worked wonders to enable the biblical editors to devise their testaments as they saw fit, shuffling historical data as a conjurer does a deck of cards."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 34 . The Origin of the Twelve Tribes of Israel In 1989 the French archaeologist Alain Zivie discovered the tomb of Akhenaton's chief minister, Aper - El. The remarkable thing about Aper - El was that he seems to have been an Israelit e - Graham Philips ( Act of God ) The first thing to clarify when it comes to the \"Israelites\" concerns the origin of the name \"Israel.\" This name was not original to the people mentioned in the bible whose center was Jerusalem. None of the cities of the Hyk sos pharaohs and their people bear the title \"Israel.\" The term originated with the Irish and with the Phoenicians who had erected prominent and sophisticated cities all over Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, and the Levant. The Phoenicians were originally of Ir ish extraction and they had some of their most important bases in Ireland and Scotland. Not only were the Phoenicians expert sailors but they made good use of the land bridges that once existed between Scandinavia and England, and between England and Irela nd. One of the chief gods of the Megalithic Irish was known as Iesa. This name has been been rendered in many ways, such as: Esa Essa Hesus Yesu Iesa Issa Jesu Jesa Jesse As we show in Volume One, Iesa was the third part of the ancient Druidic trinity. Thi s makes him equivalent to the Christian Holy Spirit as well as to Christ. An Israelite was originally an Iesaite, Iesite, or Iesalite. Some Phoenicians appear to have employed the term when referring to their god Cronus. Cronus was a Grecian rendering of C ron or Crom, another important and ancient Irish god. The Celts him as Crom Cruach \"the bent one.\" This epithet referred to Crom's great age and antiquity. The name Cronos gives the word chronology meaning \"time.\" Crom, or Cron, or Cronus was later fused w ith Saturn (the Irish Surtur or Satura) by the Greeks and Romans. The alternative historian, Comyns Beaumont, wrote explaining the Phoenician origins of Israel:"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Not until Jacob in a somewhat obscure manner was told to call himself Israel was that name adop ted and accorded to his twelve \"sons:\" but if we accept the explanation of Sanchoniathon, a Phoenician of Tyre, Cronus \"whom Phoenicians called Israel\" was king of Phoenicia, and it signified that these Chaldeo - Phoenician tribes were worshippers of Cronus - Saturn...for Jehovah was a far later importation. The name Israel has subsequently been misappropriated, for those Biblical Christians who term themselves Israelites in fact label themselves followers of a pagan deity - Comyns Beaumont ( The Riddle of Prehi storic Britain ) Actually the Jewish people have little, if any, right to the name Israel at all, for many of them are descendants of religious proselytes whose ancestry is certainly not Israelitish. Even those who do have Israelite blood have no right to a ny national use of the name Israel for they are descendants of the House of Judah, not of the House of Israel - Douglas Reed Regarding the Hyksos connection, the author Ralph Ellis has established that the syllable Hyk had two meanings that might easily ha ve been confused. The term can mean either \"captive,\" or \"king,\" depending upon whether the \"y\" is pronounced like an \"I\" (as in \"Nick\"), or as \"Y\" (as in \"Mike\") Ergo, historians can easily misidentify the Hyksos people. If modern Jews and Christians can fool the world by saying that their ancestors date back to \"slaves\" and \"captives\" rather than to \"kings,\" then the prospects for true understanding of religion and scripture, as well as for the overall state of the world, are few indeed. Ralph Ellis point s out fourteen similarities between the teachings of Akhnaton and the Israeli religion going on to say ̳these similarities demonstrate that the Egyptian religions and, specifically, the religion of Akhnaton did not die. They escaped during the exodus and h ave evolved into the familiar forms of today - Andrew Power ( Ireland: Land of the Pharaohs ) Of course, there was an Israel!

But this is not the Israel that the Bible deals with - Thomas L. Thompson ( The Mythic Past ) The people of Ysiraal in this inscription are identified by the Pharaoh with the nomads of the Ed omite Shasu or shepherds, and are classed by him with the confederate marauders who invaded Egypt with the Libu, and were defeated with huge slaughter at the battle of Procepis (Pa - ar - shep, which is also recorded on the monuments. They were a tribe or tote mic community of cattle - keepers, one of ―the tribes of the Shasu from the land of Aduma‖ who went down into Egypt in search of grazing ground to find sustenance for their herds in the eastern region of the Delta. At this very time, when the people of Ysira al and their seed were being ―wiped out‖ or annihilated as the Israelites in Syria, there was an exodus of the Edomite Shasu which has been pressed into the service of false theory on behalf of biblical ―history‖. These tribes had considered the eastern re gion of the Delta, as far as Zoan, to be their own possession, until they were driven out by Seti I - Gerald Massey (on the Merenptah stele inscription)"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The term \"Jews\" is never in the Bible applied to the Twelve Tribes or to the Ten - tribed House of Israel - ( The Ensign Trust ) ...there was no Israelite priesthood before the time of Moses - Ahmed Osman ( Moses and Akhenaten ) Like this writer, the researcher Ralph Ellis does not buy into the migration of Abraham and Sarah story. He believes that Abraham and Sarah did not come from Sumeria into Egypt in the manner commonly described. Ellis, like the great revisionist Comyns Beaumont before him, believes that Abraham (from Ab'ram meaning \"o f Ra the Father\") was the first pharaoh of the Hyksos dynasty. Abraham may have gone with his sister and wife Sarah towards Thebes (in southern Egypt) after a famine broke out in his own Northern kingdom. According to Ellis it was during this journey that the Theban king fell in love with Sarai and took her for his wife. The Southern pharaoh in question was none other than Tuthmosis III. And so, it was he, and not Abraham, who was the true father of the so - called Twelve Tribes of Israel. They were in fact t he Twelve Tribes of Aton . Since the Hyksos were rulers in the North (Lower Egypt, Delta region), they would have had dominion over the pyramids and over Heliopolis, the capital of solar worship. Hence, Akhenaton's zeal for just that kind of worship and ico nography. Ellis suggests that prior to the reign of Akhenaton, the Levite Yuya (the biblical Joseph) acted as an agent for the expelled Hyksos and returned to ingratiate himself with the pharaoh Amenhotep I. Ellis believes that he was successful and became a powerful presence behind the thrones of Tuthmosis III, Tuthmosis IV, Amenhotep III, and Akhenaton. Yuya and his family were the richest personalities in the entire world at that time, after the pharaoh himself. Ellis writes: Egypt had been a relatively stable society for thousands of years, both before and after this rebel pharaoh, the capital cities, temples, gods, arts, and social grades of the empire had changed little. Akhenaton would change them all. His whole career was out of the ordinary - ( Jesus : Last of the Pharaohs ) Akhenaton, according to both the revised biblical history and the king lists of Egypt, was a direct descendant of the Hyksos pharaohs, who were so strongly influenced by the priests of Heliopolis. This deity has to be a direct resul t of their influence. It is simply the Hyksos belief system under another name. Akhenaton‘s father Amenhotep III, must have had many sympathies with this belief in the Aton as well, but he never dared openly to promote this ―new‖ cult - ibid ...an independ ent cult of Re continued to exist at Heliopolis, no doubt resenting the wealth and power of the Amun priests in Thebes. It was to them that Akhenaton seems to have been appealing. Indeed, he seems actually to have been influenced by the cult of Re, as ther e are a number of uniquely Heliopolitan traits in Atenism...it seems likely, therefore, that Akhenaton's ideas were formulated in Heliopolis - Graham Philips ( Act of God )"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Ellis rightly ponders why modern Egyptologists have been so conspicuously silent or v ague about the Hyksos dynasty. But we can surmise that these descendants of the Hyksos/Levite pharaohs, who are still at the helm of the world's establishments, prefer things to be that way. They would naturally be most anxious to conceal their Egyptian co nnections. But most importantly, if we are correct, it follows that Akhenaton was himself related to the Hyksos. This would go a long way to explain his characteristic hubris and undisguised contempt for Egyptian gods and lifestyle. It accounts for his 16 year desecration, for the fact that he disdained mummification, banned graphic depictions of anyone or anything but himself, closed all the temples, ceased funding the priests of Amen, that he moved his capital from Thebes to Amarna (Akhetaten), and that h e opened a new burial site for his family in the \"Valley of the Kings.\" Joseph (Yuya) the Levite infiltrator was, suggestively, buried not in the Valley of the Nobles but in the more illustrious Valley of the Kings. His tomb there was the grandest ever fou nd with the exception of that belonging to Tutankhamen (his beloved nephew). Tuya‘s mummy had been found with that of her husband Yuya in their small joint tomb (KV. 46) in the Valley of the Kings. Their son - in - law Amenhotep III had honored them with a gra nd burial, filled the tomb with fabulous gold coffins and death masks, a gilded chariot, inlaid furniture, well - stuffed cushions, a jewel casket and wig box, perfume jars and sandals...Yuya in particular is regarded as the best - preserved Egyptian mummy...Both he and his wife also have bright yellow hair, originally taken as evidence for their supposed foreign origins, equally, perhaps, it may have been the effect of embalming fluids on their otherwise white hair, or evidence of a pale henna rinse - Dr. Joann Fl etcher ( The Search for Nefertiti ) It was Tuthmosis IV who most ingratiated Yuya. This Atonist pharaoh honored him with massive wealth on top of what was already his by being a Hyksos prince. W hat we are told about Joseph's poverty and low class status is a gain a blatant and cunning inversion of historical facts. Joseph's chief motive was to have a son of his own become pharaoh. His dream neared realization when his daughter Tiye was taken for wife by the romantic and decadent Amenhotep III. W e have already seen that this pharaoh was a possible prototype for the biblical King Solomon. He was known as “Dazzling Sun Disc of All the Land.” It is very likely that this infidel Hyksos blood was re - infused into the Tuthmosside dynasty, if it was not already present, since both Pharaoh Amenhotep II and Amenhotep III had the term Hyk in their royal titles. Amenhotep II was even referred to as \"Hyksos King of Heliopolis.\" In our minds, there can be little doubt that the Levite Yuya was a high - ranking Atonist.

The Atonists and their God Amongst all the mass of the religious literature of Ancient Egypt, there is no document that may be considered to contain a reasoned and connected account of the ideas and beliefs which the Egyptians associated with the god Aten - E. A. Wallis Budge ( Tutankhamen: Amenism, Atenism and Egyptian Monotheism, 1923) Iona in Scotland. The ancient seat of the High Druids. The word Iona and the Egyptian On, are related, as is the kind of theology practiced in both places. The age - old connections between Ireland and Egypt have bee n guarded for millennia Akhenaton's god Aton was largely based on Atum Ra who had been worshipped at Heliopolis for centuries. Heliopolis is a Greek rendering of the city's name. The Egyptian name for the great city was On . This word meant \"holy place\" a nd also connoted \"light.\" W e still use it today in English when we say \"onward \" (\"lightward\"), or \"turn the light on ,\" etc. This syllable is found in the Sanskrit yoni and the English word one. The term signified the holiness of light. W e think it probable that the place - name On is not unrelated to Iona , the island seat of the Druids in Scotland. Despite what Egyptologists are wont to believe, Atonism was an outgrowth of the philosophy of the Hyksos priesthood that dominated the great solar temples of Gizeh and Heliopolis. Egyptologists have been conspicuously reticent to say what god or gods the Hyksos really worshipped. As we have already mentioned, we are told they were predominantly venerators of the god Set. But a close reading of Egyptian mythology sho ws us that the god Set was worshipped in Egypt from the earliest times, long before the official dates of Hyksos rule. So either the Hyksos were resident in Egypt from very early times (a theory suggested by Ralph Ellis) or they adopted Set after they arri ved. If they were warlike and brazen, they may have appreciated the qualities of Set, the god of conflict and combat. Set's color was red, and we will still hear a person say \"I saw red\" when they speak of becoming irate and enraged."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"The god might have be en adopted by the Hyksos after their collusion with the Nubians. The Nubian anti - pharaoh Neshi, who reigned just before the Hyksos arrived, had been a worshipper of Set, and a second dynasty pharaoh called Seth Peribsen was named after the god. W e think it not unlikely, given the tribulations of the time, that the Hyksos took Nubians for spouses and had offspring of mixed blood. The children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty; and the land was fill ed with them - (Exodus 1:7) It is interesting that the Masai tribe of Africa has traditions that clearly show their connection to Egypt. Indeed, the Masai claim to have come into Africa from the Nile Valley. They refer to themselves as the \"Elect of God,\" and their god Motoni was clearly taken from Atoni or Aton. Their name may, in fact, have meant the \"Sons of Aye.\" As the authors Messod and Roger Sabbah show in their book, Secret of the Exodus , the name Masai is, suggestively, almost identical to the word Medzay that was the name of Akhenaton's police guards. In Egyptian, the word masha means \"army.\" The foreign appearance of Akhenaton's soldiers and guards has always been noted as a perplexing anomaly by Egyptologists and historians. There can be little d oubt that this African tribe's ancestors, as well as others, were allies and confidants of the Amarna kings and most likely of the Hyksos people also. So it appears that the \"Jews\" of later ages would have their work cut out for them. They had to go to gr eat lengths to downplay their connection to the Hyksos pharaohs and to obscure the nature of their heinous deeds in the land of the pyramids. This is why they chose to re - script history to make their alleged ancestors appear ragged homeless \"slaves.\" It wa s a comedown, to be sure. But it was better that history recorded them as oppressed outsiders rather than as tyrannical conquerors who raped Egypt of its many treasures. But the secret could not be kept forever. Clever scholars began to uncover the truth. Sigmund Freud, for instance, noticed that Jews and Egyptians shared the rite of circumcision that was not employed by neighboring peoples. He noticed that the name \"Moses\" was of Egyptian origins and that it was most unusual for a high born son of pharaohs to go round killing guards and taking the cause of \"oppressed\" slaves. Tradition maintains that Moses was a Levite. This seems a transparent distortion of the actual state of affairs: the Levites were Moses' people...in later times we find Egyptian names only among the Levites - Sigmund Freud ( Moses and Monotheism ) But we need not only trust Freud. The ancient historian Herodotus, back in 450 BC, had already noted how many strange similarities there were between the customs and traditions of Egyptians and so - called Hebrews. His"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"descriptions of the Egyptians are akin to those used for the Jews, in almost every respect: They are in all respects much more pious than other peoples. They are also distinguished from them by many of their customs, such as circumci sion, which for reasons of cleanliness they introduced before others; further by their horror of swine, doubtless connected with the fact that Set wounded Horus when in the guise of a black hog, and, lastly, most of all by their reverence for cows, which t hey would never eat or sacrifice because they would thereby offend the cow - headed Isis. Therefore no Egyptian man or woman would ever kiss a Greek or use his knife, his spit, or his cooking vessel, or eat with a Greek knife...In haughty narrowness they loo ked down on the other peoples who were unclean and not so near to the gods as they were - (From G. A. Erman's Die Aegyptische Religion ) And we can add to this a most important detail concerning the Egyptian and Jewish names for god. The Pharaoh Akhenaton, like his father before him, referred to god by the name Aton , a word curiously similar to the Hebrew term for god Adon (or Adonai ). W e believe that it is this similarity that proves, beyond all other clues, the connection between the Israelites and Atonist pharaohs of the New Kingdom. It is just one piece of evidence to show that monotheism was nothing new. It was not unique to the biblical Jews by any means. The origin of Egyptian monotheism can be traced back a fair distance with some certainty. In the Sc hool of Priests in the Sun Temple at On (Heliopolis) tendencies had for some time been at work developing the idea of a universal god and stressing his ethical aspects - Sigmund Freud The Aton was a solar deity, primarily based in Heliopolis, but during th e New Kingdom civil war, the deity was exiled to Amarna, along with Akhenaton and his followers. The Aton was the foundation stone upon which the Israelite deity of Adhon was laid; a single solar deity that invoked not simply the physical Sun, but the powe r and energy that lies behind that physical burning mass - Ralph Ellis ( Tempest and Exodus ) This term aton (or aten ) that we find at the end of the names Tutankhaten and Akhenaton is very important. Its origins and permutations reveal a great deal about th e nature of Akhenaton's beliefs, about the origins of his cult of the sun, and about those who have ruled the world in his name ever since. Scholars accept that there is no essential difference between the Egyptian Aton and the Israelite Adon (or Adonai). These names are the same and so are the deities and worship they denote. The transposition of a single consonant (or vowel) does not change this fact. Indeed, as the Jewish Zohar says: Adon is the sun that lights up and floods the earth - ( Book of Zohar , V ol 1) For Akhenaton, Aton was the bright morning sun that rises above the horizon. He was the sun god banishing darkness and bringing light to the world."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Akhenaton abhorred the night and adored the rising of the sun at the dawning of the day. Everything ab out the sun was sacred to Akhenaton and the Atonists. Their god Aton was primarily symbolized by a disk emanating rays or beams, often crowned or encircled by a serpent. This diadem was the symbol of the House of Akhenaton, and of the most powerful cult of priests in the world. Because of his part - Israelite upbringing, Amenhotep IV (sometimes called Amenophis IV) could not accept the Egyptian deities and their myriad idols, so he developed the notion of Aten, an omnipotent god with no image, who was represe nted by a solar - disc - Laurence Gardner ( Genesis of the Grail Kings ) In his Book of the Words, the Grand Master of Scottish Rite Freemasonry, Albert Pike, confirmed that the word Adonai means \"controller,\" \"possessor,\" \"master,\" and \"lord of women.\" In a m asonic initiation ritual we find the following exchange between master and neophyte: Question: What is the most powerful name of god...? Answer: Adonai Question: What is its power? Answer: To move the universe (Source : Maconnerie Occulte, by J. M. Ragon) T he suffix ai, found in Adonai, simply means \"one of.\" Adonai, therefore, means \"One of Adon,\" or \"One of Aton.\" In Hebrew, Adonai is spelled Adni which alerts us since it is near to the Sanskrit Agni , the Hindu (and Aryan) fire or sun god. The word Adonai is also near to the Irish Don and this is probably the origin of the word. (See Doncaster , Donegal , County Down , Downpatrick , etc). The god Don was revered since the earliest times and was known to most civilized peoples throughout Asia Minor, Europe, and the Aegean. He is familiar as the Phoenician and later Grecian Adonis, and as Donar (a name for the Nordic Thor). The Jewish Adonai (\"One of Adon\") was being used unspecifically, or connotatively. It was a place holder, sobriquet, or nick - name. Its use pre vented one from defiling the true name of god. At least that is what we are told. Using the term enabled the devotee to not defile the more sacred name of Yahweh (Jehovah). So, if we are to accept the incredible biblical account we learn the term Adonai ca me into use after Moses learned the true, if unutterable, name of his god at the burning bush. If we do not accept this story, we see that the term was already in use in Egypt, as Aten or Aton . In other words there was nothing uncommon about the terms Adon and Yahweh . The biblical account only holds true, as do the customs of the Jews, if the sacred name of their god is sacred. However, we find to our amazement that both words Yahweh and Jehovah were well known and not in the least bit unusual. The word Jeh ovah , for instance, is made from two syllables; the"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Hebrew Jah (or Yod ) meaning \"one,\" \"god,\" or \"male,\" and hovah, from havah, meaning \"female.\" The name Jehovah (or Jaheva ) simply refers to a god who is both \"male\" and \"female.\" Suggestively, the lunar g od Thoth was known as Yahu (or as Yahew ). Ralph Ellis believes this indicates that the Israelites were originally moon worshippers. They simply accepted the moon as the twin, or nighttime emissary, of their beloved sun god Aton, and saw it as a \"little sun ,\" or \"Silver Aton,\" shining at night for their benefit. The word Yahweh can also be found in the Persian Yawnah (or Jawnah ) meaning \"sun.\" The Phoenicians knew this god as Yahwe . In W elsh he was Jahna from which we get the modern Jon or John . The name Joh n , like Iona , meant \"sun\" as well as \"son .\" This is why so many male children were named after this sun god. The son is the sun of the father's life, quite literally his youngster or \"young star\" - his golden boy. W as not John of the Gospels known as the \" beloved\" one? In Syria it was Yaw which, with Yehew ( Yahweh or Jahweh ), obviously derives from the Yew tree, sacred to the Druids of old. A \"Jew\" might be a worshipper of Yahweh. This much is known. However, what if the word Adonai was the important word a nd not Yahweh? W hat if the ruse was to have the former as a sobriquet for the latter in order to draw attention away from the significance of the word Adon? If we think it merely a relatively meaningless sobriquet then our attention falls not on it as much as upon the referent Yahweh. Perhaps, the ruse was to ensure that we did not examine the word Adon and find its Egyptian and Irish roots. That the Jewish god Jehovah (Yahweh) is an Egyptian sun god and not in the least bit unique was not to become common knowledge, if it could be helped. The Egyptian connections to the Israelites had to be obscured and the name of god was a major stumbling block. So the preposterous story of Moses and the \"Burning Bush\" was concocted and the Jews themselves were fooled int o the belief that it would be scandalous irreverence to pronounce the ever so sacred name of Yahweh (Jehovah). The implication was that Adonai , being common, simply meant \"our sun god \" and was purely connotative. It could be uttered, whereas the name Jehov ah could remain unspoken. In our reading of the issue, however, the situation is just the reverse. Adonai was the sacred name of god cunningly hidden in plain sight. It was not connotative but denotative. It denoted Akhenaton , his sun god Aton, and the Egy ptian priesthood that worshipped the sun. It denoted the Israelites and Levites who were members of that same cult and devotees of that same god. We are less likely to focus on the term Adon once it is put before us as a mere convenience, a rhetorical devi ce. W e are more likely to focus on that which it is said to refer to, that is, to this mystical and mystique - drenched Yahweh . Let us state now, for the record, that it is not the name Jehovah that is important but that of Adonai, that is, of Aton. Once thi s is understood, we can declare the identity of Yahweh problem to be solved, once and for all."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"It was never the wrath of god that prevented the name YHWH from being spoken out loud to the world; instead it was the wrath of the Judaic priesthood, who feared that its religion, its nation and its whole way of life might unravel if the truth were known - Ralph Ellis ( Tempest and Exodus ) As a term for god, Adon was universal. It had been used by Cypriots, Greeks, Phoenicians, Celts, Canaanites, and Romans. Chris tians and British - Israelites would love us to believe that it was a relatively unimportant sobriquet. They maintain that its value lies in its usage as a nick - name for god, but there is no reason why this nonsense should be believed. In the Bible the Israe lite god Yahweh is sometimes referred to as Adon, though the term is used as a title, not as the personal name of Yahweh. Eventually, the appellation \"Adonai\" (my Lord) became a substitution name for pronouncing in prayer the unutterable name Yahweh, which by the early rabbinical period (first and second centuries A.D.) had become too sacred to pronounce. To this day, when Jews encounter the consonants of \"Yahweh' (YHWH) in prayer, they pronounce it \"Adonai.\" They might be shocked to learn that this substit ution word is related to the Phoenician \"Adon\" and the Greek Cypriot \"Adonis.\" Further, Muslim, Jews and Arabic - speaking, Aramaic/Syriac - speaking Christians might be shocked also to learn that their words for God come from the Phoenician god's name of \"El\" as in \"Elah,\" \"Allah,\" \"Elahona,\" \"Eloh,\" \"Elohaino,\" \"Eli,\" \"Eloi,\" \"Elohak,\" etc. - (Phoenicia.org) Gerald Massey was one of the great investigators unimpressed by the ruse, having discovered the origins of this Yahweh ( Jehov ) in prehistoric Egypt. (It can also be found in the Persian Yahwe, or Jahwe, the Jove of the Romans). Indeed, Yah was originally a name for Thoth the Egyptian moon god. His name and worship appear to have been adopted and altered to suit the ways of the solar cult. This kind of plag iarization and appropriation of customs, tropes, and idioms may have been a common practice in ancient times. The consensus of most official historians and Egyptologists is that Aton was Adonai or Jehovah , and that Akhenaton was the world's first monotheis t. The renegade king is seen romantically as a struggler for the light of truth, a man divinely guided to establish a pure religion stripped of evil pagan elements. A fine picture has been painted of him by those propagandists of the Solar Cult. W e sense s ycophantism of those who drool over this deformed prince of light and are prompted by their aggrandizing rhetoric to think of the Atonist theology as either the brain - child of an ego - maniac, or the elaborate design of a most perfidious Luciferian enclave.

Professor T. E. Peet cuts through the miasma and states our own particular attitude precisely: What precisely was the nature of Disk worship as con ceived by Akhnaton? This is a subject on which a considerable amount of nonsense has been talked and written, mainly because romance and imagination have been suffered to play too great a part in the inquiry...In the form of the god there is certainly noth ing to lend colour to the oft stated belief that the Aten is not the sun's physical disk but 'the power which lay behind it.' On the contrary it may be said that no Egyptian god had ever been represented under so purely physical an aspect as this, even the nature gods having been given a human body. The very word Aten itself tells the same story for it was simply the common Egyptian word for the sun's disk in the purely material sense, and if there was any real change in Akhenaton's new conception of the su n god as shown in form and name it was in the direction of greater materialism - (From Akhenaton, Ty, Nefertete and Mutznezemt, in W. Brunion's Kings and Queens of Ancient Egypt, 1925) The evidence of two gods being fused into one can be found concealed wi thin the early passages of the Old Testament. The Book of Exodus , that tells of the first meeting of Moses and Yahweh, makes it clear that Yahweh was a new god to the Israelites. This problematic dichotomy was solved by the bible's composers and editors wh o attempted to fuse the old pagan god with the newer god of Moses. The passage, that reveals the lack of antiquity of Yahweh, can be found at Exodus chapter six. God spoke to Moses and said to him: \"I am Yahweh. To Abraham and Isaac and Jacob I appeared as El Shaddai; I did not make myself known to them by my name Yahweh...Say this, then, to the sons of Israel, 'I am Yahweh. I will free you of the burdens which the Egyptians lay on you...I will adopt you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you sh all know that it is I, Yahweh, your God, who have freed you from the Egyptians' burdens...' This sales pitch of god, directed via his minister to a people who did not know him, was clearly a clever insertion made to link a new and exclusive god with one re cognized, accepted, and worshipped by all. If the people of Israel knew of this god, and if they had already been worshipping him since time immemorial, such a passage would never have been found in the bible or anywhere else. But if Yahweh is Aton, a uniq ue solar deity worshipped by a select few, the passage would make perfect sense. W e discover from this passage that Yahweh was not the god to whom the poor \"enslaved\" Israelites were praying. He was simply not their god. He was a god who entered in of his own volition to adopt and rescue them, demanding to be followed and obeyed. And he threw down curses on those who refused to do so.

Even more perplexing is the question why Yahweh, if he desired the release of his beloved children, \"hardened pharaoh's heart\" to prevent it from easily taking place? I myself will harden Pharaoh's heart, and perform many a sign an d wonder in the land of Egypt. Pharaoh will not listen to you and so I will smite Egypt and lead out my armies, my people, the sons of Israel - (Exodus 7:3 - 4) This scandalous passage reveals that god was playing games with his beloved children. He flagrant ly manipulated the situation in order to be admired, noticed, and awed, and because he wished to wreak vengeance upon those he hates, those who have not taken to his worship. Certain verses reveal that this Yahweh was apprehensive and afraid that he would be forgotten by those he had adopted. Given the idiosyncrasies of the accounts, we question whether they concern the history of god or men. If Yahweh were a god known from earliest times would his devotees be likely to forget him?

The ordinary \"J ew\" would not be privy to this tradition. To this very day the majority of biblical researchers and practitioners of the Judeo - Christian religion are unaware that the oral tradition (that eventually became the basis of Talmudic Judaism) was Egyptian and At onist in origin. The Levites cunningly rescripted their history and liberally plagiarized the cultural archives of many other Occidental and Oriental religions and ethnic groups, including the Irish, the Goths, and the Phoenicians. As we demonstrate on the se following pages there is not a shred of factual evidence for their \"history.\" The authors of the Abraham story afforded no dates for this legendary migration, and that omission alone speaks volumes. It is from their time with Akhenaton and his cult of t he sun that the Levites began to believe they had a special spiritual destiny.

The Bible - Chronicle of the Atonists But you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation - (Exodus 19:6) The various pharaohs and dignitaries of the eighteen th dynasty (1550 - 1335 BC) are listed below. These personages, together with their wives, consorts, families, and court, made up one of at least 32 dynasties. Ahmose I His reign (1550 - 1525 BC) opened the so - called \"New Kingdom\" and the eighteenth dynasty. Officially, he is believed to have routed the so - called \"Hyksos\" invaders and to have forced them from the land in the first of two historical mass expulsions. The bible's exodus tale is a fusion of these two expulsions, the first at the time of Ahmose, th e second during the reign of Heremheb, the last pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty. The restored Egypt, with Thebes as capital, rose to be the most powerful nation on the Earth after the overthrow of the Hyksos. Amenhotep I He was the son of Ahmose I and th e great queen Ahmose Nefertiry. He reigned with his father for a time and was quite young when he became pharaoh. Like his father he was a devout worshipper of Amen Ra and Osiris, the Theban gods. Some believe him to have been the founder of the priesthood of Amen Ra. His reign was peaceful and he continued with the work of restoration after the expulsion of the Hyksos usurpers. His own son died at birth and so his brother - in - law, Tuthmosis, became pharaoh after him. Tuthmosis I The first pharaoh not of ro yal blood. His wife Ahmose, the sister of Amenhotep I, possessed the class distinction and was the legal heir to the throne. A commoner whose father is unknown, he was general of the guard and was legally made pharaoh late in his life. He was an exemplary military leader and stability was assured under his reign. Two of his sons died prematurely but he had a third son by way of a minor wife who was sister to princess Ahmose. His most famous child was a daughter named Hatshepsut who eventually became a power ful pharaoh. His third son, also named Tuthmosis, succeeded him"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"under the name Tuthmosis II. One of Tuthmosis I's titles was \"Horus Ra who comes from the Aten.\" Tuthmosis II He was the third son of Tuthmosis I by way of a minor wife Mutnofret. Being a less er son he married his own half - sister Hatshepsut to ensure a chance at becoming pharaoh. Two older brothers died leaving the way open for him to achieve his goal. He reigned with his brother Tuthmosis III in a co - regency for about 13 years. He named his ow n son, another Tuthmosis, as his successor. He died young and his remains were supposedly discovered at the mortuary temple of queen Hatshepsut. Apparently he died from the effects of some lethal disease. Tuthmosis III Although the legitimate heir to the t hrone he was too young and inexperienced to rule when he was made pharaoh. So it was at this point that queen Hatshepsut, who had the favor of the Amenite priesthood of Karnak, became co - regent with him. She was his aunt and step - mother. His regency was be tween 1479 - 1425 BC. During the early years of the reign he was shunted aside by the domineering Hatshepsut. Later, when he came into his own he deposed Hatshepsut and established his reputation as a great warrior pharaoh. So feared and respected was he tha t he was given the title \"Pharaoh.\" This was a term used by foreign nations. The Egyptians used the term \"Zera\" or \"Sera\". Tuthmosis III is now referred to as the \"Napoleon\" of Egypt. He was married to several foreign wives. An expert fighter and leader he is now a good candidate for the true father of the biblical Isaac. Prototype of the biblical patriarch Abraham he was the actual father of the so - called Twelve Tribes of Israel. Author Ahmed Osman regards Tuthmosis III as the prototype for the biblical ki ng David. In any case, due to his antipathy for Hatshepsut, and presumably for the Amenists who supported her against him, Tuthmosis III may have eventually favored the worship of Aton. Because he did not bring offerings to the temples of Amen after his ma ny conquests and battles he was no favorite of the Amenite priests. The dearth of songs, folktales, and hymns to him, and the lack of records about his life and reign, are doubtless due to this antipathy. Queen Hatshepsut She ruled as co - regent with Tuthmo sis III for two years when she decided, around 1479 BC, to take the dominant position, ruling not merely as queen but as pharaoh. Her reign lasted approximately twenty - two years.

Late in the reign of Tuthmosis III, many her statu es were desecrated and destroyed. Historians believe that this was done at the behest of Tuthmosis although detailed research showed that it occurred late in his reign when he already an old man. During her regency, the conflict with the Hyksos continued. A stele commemorates Hatshepsut's victory over them. It reads: I have restored that which had been ruined. I raised up that which had gone to pieces formerly, since the Asiatics were in the midst of Avaris of the Northland, and vagabonds were in the midst of them, overthrowing that which had been made. They ruled without Re and did not act by divine command. Amenhotep II The son of Tuthmosis III, he was a belligerent and cruel war pharaoh. Something of a maniac he revived human sacrifice and took to the wo rship of his own concocted pantheon made up of several national and foreign gods. After crushing a rebellion in Syria he returned with the bodies of captured victim's corpses strung from his ship's prow. A proficient athlete and archer he appears to have b een the model for the Grecian Achilles and for Homer's Odysseus. It is very likely that most of his wives were foreign. Some may have been from the far west since scholars have not named any of them. These wives, together with the majority of his princes a nd princesses, are undocumented to this day. Some historians speculate that the Egyptians were of a mind to fast forget this pharaoh and his antics. His wife was called Tiaa and their famous son Tuthmosis IV ruled after him. Tuthmosis IV Possibly the son o f Amenhotep II and Tiaa. Evidence has come to light that indicates that he may have been illegitimate. His features certainly betray distinct Asiatic origins. His own wife was not mentioned as being minor or major so there is doubt as to the legitimacy of his own son Pharaoh Amenhotep III whose own features were decidedly foreign. There is precious little documentation on this pharaoh and his reign and we believe that this is not by chance. He was the first pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty to forgo worship of Amen Ra, and evidence shows that he was strongly favored by the Heliopolitan priesthood.

Ahmed Osman believes this biblical Joseph to be none other than the 18th dynasty dignitary Yuya who, with wife Tuya, tutored Akhenaton, their strange grandson. Amenhotep III The son of Tuthmosis IV and his queen Mutemuaa, he came to the throne in 1391 BC and reigned for approximately thirty six years. Like his father he had profoundly non - Egyptian feature s and was clearly a foreign - blooded pharaoh. He was the prototype for King Solomon and was the husband of Joseph's powerful but commoner daughter Tiye. The father of Akhenaton, he was known as \"The Dazzling Sun Disk of All the Land.\" He was instrumental in bringing in the worship of Aton but was also obsessed with the solar goddess Sekhmet to whom he raised countless statues. Due to the death of this eldest son, Akhenaton became pharaoh. Amenhotep's final years are undocumented and he is believed to have pe rished due either to insanity or some disease. Yuya Although he never reigned as a pharaoh he was the unseen authority behind the thrones of Amenhotep III and Akhenaton. Lately identified as the prototype for the biblical Joseph, he was the richest man in the world after the pharaoh who promoted him. He possessed many illustrious titles. Pharaoh Amenhotep III awarded him the title \"Father of a God,\" a title later passed to his son Aye. Since his daughter Tiye was the mother of Akhenaton, Yuya was the grandf ather of the man who would become the most notorious pharaoh in Egypt's long history. His son Aye, the uncle of Akhenaton, would also go on to be a major player in the story of the Atonists. Yuya and his wife Tuya were among the major educators and caretak ers of the young Akhenaton. They were Israelites descended from the Hyksos people and were probably of elite rank within that allegedly foreign race. This is probably the reason why Yuya bore the illustrious title \"Father to a Pharaoh.\" It is believed that one of his wives, Asenath, was the daughter of the chief priest of the sun at Heliopolis. Yuya cleverly arranged matters so that his daughter Tiye married Pharaoh Amenhotep III, the son of Tuthmosis IV, who had first honored him. Yuya (Joseph) was descend ed from Yakobaam/Jacoba/Jacob, an earlier Hyksos pharaoh. In the bible we are told that Jacob‟s name was changed to Israel, hence the Hyksos people can be known as “Israelites.” If Yuya was indeed the same man as the biblical Joseph it is interesting to no te that he served as the chief \"tax collector\" in charge of the seizure and acquisition of many private estates. The seven years of famine also helped Joseph prosper since, as the bible states, the rich of many lands came to Egypt to purchase grain. More i mportantly, for our investigations, the bible reveals that Joseph's initial"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"benefactor, Potiphar, was a sun priest of the city of On, or Heliopolis. In Hebrew the name Potiphar means \"powerful pharaoh\" and in Coptic it means \"belonging to the sun.\" In his fine books author, Ahmed Osman, writes about the effect Yuya's mummified visage had upon him. He relates how his discovery of the connection between Yuya and the biblical Joseph led him to his masterly revisionist readings of the bible and Egyptian history . Queen Tiye Also known as Ti. The daughter of Yuya, she was the chief wife of Amenhotep III (sister of Aye), and mother of Akhenaton (and possibly of Tutankhamun). Certainly one of the most powerful women of the eighteenth dynasty it was her scheming that arranged for Akhenaton to wed Nefertiti thus ensuring his eligibility for kingship. Her brother Anen was an important sun priest at Heliopolis and her father Yuya the richest nobleman in the world. Researcher Graham Philips believes Tiye to be the mother of Akhenaton, Tutankhamun and Smenkhare, pharaohs all. A shrine made for her tomb was discovered in the tomb of Smenkhare. Tiye's remains were allegedly discovered in 1898 within the tomb of Amenhotep II. Priests moved the queen's body to this tomb around 1000 BC to elude tomb robbers who were a major problem in ancient times. Tiye is reckoned to have been around 48 when she died. Sitamun The consensus is that she was the mother of Nefertiti. Unlike Tiye she was of royal blood and bore the official title \"G reat Royal W ife.\" Her children were true claimants to the throne of Egypt. She was probably the daughter of the pharaoh Amenhotep III as well as his wife. Sitamun's sister was called Isis. Akhenaton (Amenhotep IV) Sometimes rendered Ikhnaton , his original name was Amenhotep IV. His name is thought to mean \"Aton is Satisfied.\" He came to the throne in 1353 as a married man aged fourteen. He, or his brother Tuthmosis, was the prototype for the biblical Moses. His wives were Nefertiti and Kiya. W ith Nefertiti he had six daughters. Suggestively, according to the bible, the wife of the biblical Moses was known as Adonith , which means “of Aten.” This would refer to Nefertiti. His son Tutankhamen was probably born to his second wife Kiya. This theory is disputed b y Ralph Ellis who believes Aye to have been Tutankhamen's true father, and by a few other Egyptologists who believe he was the son of Tiye and her husband Amenhotep III, making him the brother of Akhenaton. Akhenaton reigned for approximately 17 years. He built his first Atonist temple practically in the shadow of the temple of Amun (Amen Ra) as a mark of disrespect to the Amenist priesthood who had once saved Egypt by"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"expelling the Hyksos usurpers.

Akhenaton was probably the prototype for the biblical Adam. W all reliefs and other images show his god Aton \"breathing\" into his nostrils by way of the Ankh, or symbol of breath and life. Akhenaton is also often depicted androgynously, that is in the form of both sexes. Akhenaton, Nefertiti, and their children, are depicted running about naked in their private garden and apartments at Amarna. Akhenaton also bore the title \"first prophet of Aton\" and, since Aton was none other than the Judaic - Christian Jehovah, this would make Akhenaton a great candidate for the biblical Adam. This \"Adam theory\" is accurate given that we remember the idea of Adam to be primordial, reaching back before the time of the Amarna period to the worship of the god Atum Ra of Heliopolis. It is possible that beloved elements of this ancient \"Adamic\" myth were merely being re - enacted by the dramatically inclined Akhenaton and his relatives. In any case, the story of the banishing of Adam and Eve from the idyllic \"garden\" h as been likened to the expulsion of Akhenaton and his Nefertiti (or Kiya) from power in Egypt. Egyptologists have noticed the singular fact that Queen Kiya's name (from Khavah , meaning \"Life\") is suggestively close to \"Eve.\" Nefertiti A problematic persona ge. She was the daughter of Sitamun and wife of the most powerful man in the world, Akhenaton. Her name meant \"Beautiful One Who Has Come.\" She was the mother of Meritaten (\"Beloved of Aton\") who made her way, under the name Scota, to Ireland. Nefertiti di sappears from the scene during the fifteenth year of Akhenaton's reign when a deadly plague began sweeping the land. Archaeologist Dr. Joann Fletcher may have discovered her body within the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep II. Nefertiti's sister Mutnodjmet was ma rried to Pharaoh Heremheb who overcame the Atonists and attempted to rectify the havoc that Akhenaton had caused throughout the land. Expert on the Hyksos period, author Ralph Ellis, believes Nefertiti and Mutnodjmet to have been daughters of Aye, the prie st of the sun and uncle of Akhenaton. Nefertiti has been taken as a prototype for the biblical Mary the mother of Jesus, as Eve, and also as the Old Testament Sarah. If her disappearance was in fact a banishment, then Nefertiti may be a liable prototype fo r the biblical Lilith who was banished to the wilderness because of her rivalry with Adam and Eve. "},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Kiya The second wife of Akhenaton, she is officially believed to have been the mother of Tutankhamen. She is considered the main prototype for the biblical Eve. In Hebrew, Eve is known as Khavah, from Khiyah meaning \"Life.\" Kiya was known as the \"King's Favorite W ife.\" According to Ralph Ellis, Kiya (whose real name was apparently Mutnodjmet) was not a worshipper of Aton even though she was married to Akhena ton. Indeed, on wall reliefs Kiya is not depicted venerating Aton with the rest of the royal family. Apparently, Akhenaton tolerated her iconoclasm and permitted her to use the name Mutnodjmet that referenced the ancient vulture goddess Mut whose worship h e had officially banned. Ellis believes Kiya to have been a daughter of the powerful Atonist Aye, son of Yuya and uncle of Akhenaton. If this is true she would have been the sister of Nefertiti whom Ellis also believes to have been a daughter of Aye. Given that Kiya and Mutnodjmet were one and the same person, she became the wife of Pharaoh Heremheb after the abdication of Akhenaton and the removal of the hated Atonist regime. The story of Eve, the fallen and corrupt woman, may have been based on Kiya and h er stubborn refusal to worship Aton, the Jehovah of the Levites, god of light. The Old Testament story of Lilith may also have been based on Kiya and her antics. Meritaten The eldest of the six daughters of Nefertiti and Akhenaton, she was wedded to her fa ther Akhenaton and ruled as queen of Egypt for a brief time after Nefertiti's strange disappearance. She may have borne a child to her father, known as \"Meritaten the Less.\" She was also the consort of Smenkhare and ruled with him after the death of Akhena ton. Evidence has come to light that shows that they attempted to maintain the worship of Aton. Other names for Meritaten were Mayati and, after her departure from Egypt, Scota. As we show in Volume One, she survived the great plague that swept Egypt and, after her father died, she and her entourage traveled from Egypt to Scythia, Spain, and then (either she or a namesake daughter) crossed over to Ireland. Ireland took the name Scota from her and, after Irish tribes colonized Scotland, that country also bor e her name. Scota's own tomb (or that of a namesake daughter) is in County Kerry. W e believe that it was by way of this Scota, and her husband and fellow Egyptian - Scythian travelers, that Atonism came to the W est, wreaking havoc with the unadulterated form of stellar theology practiced there. Different traditions render her husband‟s name as Mil, Mile (meaning \"warrior\") or Gathalus, or Gaythelos. The \"Milesian\" invasion of Ireland, as it is officially known, was in this authors view the invasion of the Ato nists. Relics and inscriptions confirm that Meritaten was an ardent Atonist who did not tolerate dissenting beliefs or actions. The severe damage and desecration done to the great Amenist temple of Karnak is believed to have been done her"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"request. Due to t his hardliner stance and intolerant behavior, Meritaten was probably despised by the majority of the Amenist priests and by the Egyptian people still secretly loyal to the old gods. After the fall of Akhenaton's bizarre dynasty, Meritaten may have been for ced to flee abroad. W e believe this to be the actual reason for her departure to foreign parts. After Smenkkare's death, Tutankhamun came to the throne with a much more tolerant attitude. He placated the Amenist priesthood and renounced the worship of Aton . This action would have made him an instant adversary to Meritaten, his half - sister. After Tutankhamun's theological about face Egypt would not have been a saf e haven for Meritaten and the hardliner Atonists. Some Egyptologists speculate that Meritaten le ft Egypt partly due to her rivalry with Kiya whose importance was very great. After Nefertiti's disappearance it was Kiya who became the most important women in Atonist Egypt. Meritaten, not wanting to be outshone, may have decided to vacate Egypt altogeth er. It is known that Meritaten ordered the desecration of the images and tomb of Kiya at Amarna. She had her rival's facial features and inscriptions chiseled off and she even appropriated Kiya's personal temple. Author Ralph Ellis speculates that Scota wa s not Meritaten but another daughter (and wife) of Akhenaton called Ankhesenamun. Smenkhare A problematic personage. Theories differ on the length of his reign, and whether he reigned alone. Probably the younger brother of Akhenaton and son of Amenhotep I II, he was the prototype for Aaron the brother of Moses. He was co - regent with his father Akhenaton and before his early death he briefly reigned alone just before the ascent to the throne of Tutankhamun. His name meant \"Vigorous is the Soul of Ra.\" Some s cholars believe Smenkhare to have been Nefertiti in her guise as pharaoh after the death of her husband Akhenaton. This is somewhat unlikely since one of the daughters of Akhenaton, Ankhesenpaaten, is known to have been married to Smenkhare. Moreover, Nefe rtiti was buried under her own name. If she had have reigned as Smenkhare she would most probably have been interred under his throne name. For a short time after he became pharaoh, Smenkhare was married to Meritaten (Scota) who disappeared from the scene during the plague years that killed most of Akhenaton's daughters. In the year 1907, when the tomb of Smenkhare (tomb 55, Valley of the Kings) was discovered and opened by Edward Ayrton, Arthur W eigall, and Theodore Davis, the mummy was found in the positi on customary for queens. Instead of both arms being crossed at the chest, one arm was straight at the side. Many strange features of the internment, taken together with the complete identity erasure, heavy desecration, and removal of precious tomb artifact s, have perplexed archaeologists and historians. The magical inscriptions that protect the soul of the dead pharaoh were removed and, to all intents and purposes, the tomb"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"appeared to have been a prison. Investigator Graham Philips, in his book on Smenkhar e, Act of God, wrote: Egyptian tombs were always constructed with one purpose in mind - to keep intruders out. But what Davis and Ayrton had unearthed was an Egyptian tomb unlike any discovered before or since. It was constructed to keep someone or somethi ng trapped inside. W hat Smenkhare could have done to deserve such a terrible fate, to be \"imprisoned for eternity,\" is the subject of much speculation. So severe was the \"curse\" on this tomb that for a long time scholars believed the mummy inside to have b een that of Akhenaton who was certainly hated by the people and priests of Egypt and who would have deserved such treatment. Although Akhenaton's name was found desecrated and erased in the tomb, indicating that the antipathy toward Smenkhare did extend to him as well, it was certainly not Akhenaton's body therein. Graham Philips has concluded that the tomb was sealed in such a strange fashion due to the notion held by the Egyptian priests and people that Smenkhare was the source of, or channel for, a pesti lential disease that had brought about the virulent plague that swept their land late in the reign of Akhenaton. Since pharaoh was the center of Egyptian society, since every aspect of life revolved around him, and since the gods worked their will directly through pharaoh, the Egyptian mind would have believed that if and when some major and inexplicable disaster befell the land then the king was its source and transmitter. Only by some elaborate and radical performance of rites could disaster be allayed. D ressing and styling Smenkhare's mummy as a female was done because he had been identified with Sekhmet, the lion - headed goddess of pestilence, ruin, and destruction. Smenkhare died when he was around 20 years of age. Tutankhamen The consensus is that he wa s the son of Akhenaton and his second but favorite wife Kiya. Naturally, this theory is disputed by a few historians. Moreover, on an inscription at a Sudanese temple, Tutankhamun himself speaks of being the son of Pharaoh Amenhotep III. In that case Tutan khamun would, like this father, have been foreign - blooded. Being the son of Amenhotep III would have made Tutankhamun the younger brother of Akhenaton and not his son. DNA evidence apparently confirmed that Tutankhamun was the brother of Smenkhare and most Egyptologists do now believe Smenkhare to have been the son of Amenhotep III. This indicates that he too may have been raised and tutored by the Israelites Yuya and Tuya at Goshen (Avaris). For Tutankhamun to be the son of Amenhotep III means that the lat ter must have lived longer than most Egyptologists speculated, and that he may even have been a major influence during the reign of his son Akhenaton. He may even have been co - regent with him. Archaeologists Flinders Petrie, John Pendlebury, and Herbert Fa irman, found some evidence to suggest that this was the case. Also known as Tutankhamun and"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Tutankhaten, his title was \"The Living Image of the Aten.\" He was married to one of Akhenaton's surviving daughters, Ankhesenpaaten, and through her he had a legiti mate right to the throne of Egypt. Ralph Ellis suggests that he may really have been the son of Aye and not Akhenaton, while author Charles Pope (following on from Immanuel Velikovsky) believes that both Tutankhamun and Smenkhare were born from the incestu ous relationship between Akhenaton and his foreign - blooded mother queen Tiye. He ruled for approximately 9 years, coming to the throne when he was 8 years old and dying at age 17. Irish style torcs and beads were found amongst his tomb treasures. During hi s regency, that was probably shared with his grandfather (or uncle) Aye, he appears to have completely renounced the worship of Aton. By the time he commissioned his own stele at Karnak, he had changed his name from Tutankhaten to Tutankhamun. Additionally , his tomb contained the images of many Egyptian gods, not something seen with the rest of the Atonist clan. Evidence suggests that he was murdered, but on the whole there is not a lot of clear information about who Tutankhamun was, or where he came from. This dearth of information may be due, not to the ancient Egyptians and their indifference to his person and reign, but to the strange and reprehensible activities of those Victorian \"archaeologists\" who discovered his tomb. The famous tomb was officially opened to the world on February 13, 1905. His fabulous golden funerary mask and nested coffins appear to have been made for someone else. The tomb was discovered by the unscrupulous Howard Carter and eminent financial backer Lord George Herbert, the fifth Earl of Carnarvon. The devious, power - hungry Earl was married to a daughter of Baron Rothschild and it was Rothschild money that he used to finance the excavation of the tomb of Tutankhamun. The Carter team had actually discovered the tomb eight years befo re their fraudulent public announcement of it. The tomb was much larger and richer than the world ever knew. The Rothschild agents illegally looted it of over 80 percent of its treasure and, with the assistance of the Times newspaper of London, methodicall y concocted and manipulated the global media frenzy that followed their would - be discovery of the tomb meticulously doctored to appear authentic. The mummy of the young pharaoh was mutilated beyond recognition by Carter and his team who tore it to pieces t o get at the golden mask and over 145 embedded gems, jewels, and priceless ornaments it bore. Authors Gerald O'Farrell and Ahmed Osman believe there is no doubt that Tutankhamen was the same person as the biblical Joshua whom Moses (Akhenaton) predicted wo uld succeed him. Since the Mosaic Joshua was a model for the Gospel Jesus Tutankhamun was, therefore, the prototype of the Jesus Christ of Christianity. Secret papyri found within the tomb of Tutankhamun, and kept back from the public by Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon, prove this to be much more than theory. The stolen and secreted papyri revealed that Tutankhamun had ordered the murder of a priest of Aton for some misdemeanor and had him hanged on a tree to die. In retaliation another high priest of Aton arranged to"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"have Tutankhamun intercepted and murdered while on his way to visit his exiled father, Akhenaton, at Sinai. His corpse was, for a time, also hung on a tree. Moreover, in Egyptian the term \"Carpenter\" (Setepenre) was used as a title for pharaoh . The many strange deaths of men involved with the excavation of the tomb of Tutankhamun, including Baron Richard Bethel, Lord W estbury, Arthur W eigall, George Jay Gould, Arthur Mace, and Lord Carnarvon himself - those put down to the \"curse of the pharaoh s\" - were deliberate assassinations by an unknown hand committed to ensure that the truth of Tutankhamun's identity remained a secret. After Lord Carnarvon's mysterious death his body was mummified and his stomach removed. His Rothschild wife, Almina Victo ria Maris W ombell, inherited his immense collection of Egyptian artifacts including those stolen with Carter from the tomb of Tutankhamun. Ralph Ellis speculates that Tutankhamun was not the son of Akhenaton or of Amenhotep III but of Aye, the uncle of Akh enaton. This is because Smenkhare came to the throne directly after Akhenaton's removal. If Tutankhamun had been the true legal descendant of Akhenaton, it is likely that he and not Smenkhare would have succeeded him. But it is not easy to be sure when it comes to this particular era of Egyptian history. Many of the beautiful artifacts found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, including the famous golden mask (from the second interior coffin), were made for Smenkhare and were originally in his tomb before being app ropriated by the priests and moved to the lavish tomb of Tutankhamun. The face seen on the famous golden mask is that of Smenkhare and not Tutankhamun. Some Egyptologists believe that Tutankhamun may have despised Smenkhare and ordered his tomb to be loote d. This is unlikely, since the latter's mummy was left unharmed. Aye A problematic character. He was one of the most powerful nobles of the Amarna period and, after his removal from office and exile, he appears to have attempted to seize the throne of Egyp t for the Atonists. The son of Israelite Yuya, and brother of queen Tiye, Aye was the uncle and tutor of Akhenaton and prototype for the biblical character known as Joseph of Arimathea. Holder of high military rank, Aye took the throne in 1324 BC after the untimely death of his grandson Tutankhamen and he ruled for four years. A high priest of Aton he appears to have capitulated and renounced Atonism while he ruled as pharaoh. However, other evidence suggests that he remained a loyal closet Atonist to the e nd, expertly working both sides (Atonists and Amunists, monotheists and polytheists) to suit his own agenda and to preserve his precarious regency. Ralph Ellis offers the controversial theory that Aye (or Aya) was none other than Jehovah, the god who direc ted Moses at the burning bush. This theory is also advocated by researchers Messod and Roger Sabbah who, referring to interesting passages within the \"Aramaic Bible\" (or \"Targum\"), clearly show that the Mosaic \"Jehovah\" was named"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"\"Aye.\" Later, he took on t he name or title Adonai meaning \"Lord Aye.\" Given that this theory is accurate, Aye would have been very a prominent Atonist indeed and a powerful successor to Akhenaton. It would make him the supreme authority of the Atonists. Interestingly, in this regar d the famous Hymn to the Aton , composed by Akhenaton, was found in Aye's tomb. Ellis also believes that Aye left Egypt after losing his regency and made his way to Athens. Athens was named after Aton, and Ellis believes that Aye (whose Grecian name was Dan nus) attempted to invade Egypt from Greece. Ellis believes that Aye's descendants played a part in the Trojan W ars and also possibly, as the \"Sea People,\" plagued Egypt during the regency of Merenptah. Ellis has also speculated that Aye could have been the same person as Mile, whom the Scots named Gaythelos. This Mile, after departing Egypt with his wife Scota, is rumored to have settled in Spain near the river Ebro. His descendants were the so - called \"Milesian\" (Atonist) conquerors of Ireland (See Volume O ne). Researchers Messod and Roger Sabbah believe the exiled Israelites and Judites to have been followers of Aye. The \"tomb\" of Aye was found empty of all contents. Researcher Graham Philips takes a different view than Ellis and surmises that Aye and Tutan khamun both openly rejected Atonism in order to appease the Amenist priests and Egyptian people, and to ensure the preservation of their precarious authority. In any case, Aye was an old man by the time he became pharaoh and he is officially believed to ha ve died after his fourth year of rule. Interestingly, before Aye came to the throne, Ankhesenpaaten, the wife of the deceased Tutankhamun, made contact with the king of the Hittites to ask him to send a son to assume the throne of Egypt. This act of treach ery provides us with an insight into the level of Atonist hatred toward Egypt. W hen the insidious Atonist plan to summon a foreign and despised prince to Egypt went awry, Aye took the throne. He married Ankhesenpaaten to gain legal title. The Hittites were of Indo - European racial stock and their capital was in Anatolia (modern Turkey). They had been Egypt's direst enemies for centuries. It is believed that Pharaoh Heremheb was the one who foiled Ankhesenpaaten‟s nefarious plan. She certainly lived in fear o f him. Graham Philips offers the interesting idea that Ankhesenpaaten and Aye incited the coup involving the Hittites precisely to embroil the two enemy countries in a war to further their own ends. W ith Heremheb, their feared Egyptian rival, away fighting to defend Egypt, the way would have been open for them to secure their positions. This intrigue may even have been directed by the exiled Atonists who had found some refuge in the nearby city of Tanis. It was in a similar manner, at a time when Egypt was weak, that the Hyksos came to power in the first place, in ages past. Heremheb Also referred to as Horemheb. The adversary and vanquisher of the Cult of Aton and restorer of the old gods. His coronation title was \"Golden Horus - the"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Powerful Bull\" He was m arried to Nefertiti‟s sister Mutnodjmet whom Ralph Ellis believes was the same person as queen Kiya. Kiya was apparently not an ardent Atonist and was permitted by Akhenaton to keep her pagan name that honored the ancient vulture goddess Mut. General Herem heb's intelligence and military skill allowed him to expertly foil the Atonist plan to involve his country in a bloody foreign war with the Hittites from Turkey. His men are believed to have intercepted and killed the Hittite prince Zannanza who had been s ummoned to Egypt by Ankhesenpaaten and Aye. It was either Heremheb, or one of his immediate successors (Ramses I, Seti I, or Ramses II), who was the pharaoh conveniently not named in the Old Testament‟s preposterous exodus story. Heremheb may have been tak en as a model for Herod, or Pilate, by later Atonist - Levite mythmongers. As nothing more is heard of Ankhesenpaaten after Heremheb became pharaoh, scholars assume she was either routed or killed off. From predynastic times the pharaohs of Egypt were in t he habit of considering themselves personifications of the sun. The strange idea had been vogue for thousands of years. It was, therefore, not a massive change when Akhenaton, the so - called first \"monotheist,\" decided that he too was a personification of t he solar orb. It was not this theory that was so obnoxious to the Egyptian priests and people, but the contemptuous and irreverent manner in which he enforced his dogma that caused them so much consternation and that ultimately compelled them to rid themse lves of this most \"meddlesome priest.\"  "},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":" Aye - Israelite pharaoh after Tutankhamen. The power behind the throne of Akhenaton. His name meant the \"Eye.\" The Jewish Targum, or Aramaic Bible, confirms his Atonist leanings and reveals him to have been the lea der that the Jews entitled \"Jehovah,\" or \"Adonai,\" meaning \"Lord Aye.\" Does the eye at the top of the Pyramid represent the Eye of Aye, the Atonist? So when we hear it admitted that Christianity owes a great deal to Akhenaton's monotheistic cult we need to reflect and understand that it does not stop there. Christianity is based not only on Akhenaton's particular skewed version of solar theology, but on Egyptian sun worship of every sort. Splitting hairs over the matter and indicting one particular late version of the form of veneration does not change this fact, it merely emphasizes it. Author Ralph Ell is (following on from the great Comyns Beaumont) has a slightly different opinion regarding Akhenaton and Smenkhare. He suggests that Akhenaton was Aaron and that Tuthmosis (a mysterious first brother to Akhenaton that official historians have been curious ly vague and dismissive about) was Moses. W e can presume it more likely, after perusing the revisionist scholars, that Akhenaton himself makes a more logical prototype for the man Jesus than this son Tutankhamen. After all, one of the titles of Akhenaton w as \"Son of the Sun\" (or \"Son of God\"). His wife Nefertiti would then make a good approximation of Mary Magdalene. It is an intriguing theory to mull over. Each reader and researcher must come to their own conclusions over the various biographical discrepan cies. Tuthmosis III (born to a concubine) went on, after the domineering Hatshepsut's death, to become a great warrior king and, as we have said, evidence has now come to light that he was the prototype of the biblical David . Controversially, it was he an d not Abraham who sired the biblical Isaac. Tuthmosis III was the actual father of the so - called \"Israelites.\" Naturally, this is a closely guarded secret of the masonic type fraternities. It is a secret that the biblical editors were most anxious to conceal in order to obscure the connectio ns between themselves and the pharaohs of Egypt."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"The task of identifying the historical David is complicated from the outset by the fact that the Old Testament provides us with two contrasting Davidic characters who cannot have been the same person...Howe ver, amalgamated the stories of the two Davids - one warrior king who lived in the fifteenth century BC, and the other a tribal chief who lived five centuries later - should be seen as another facet of the attempt by Old Testament editors (Jewish scribes l iving in Babylon between the sixth and third centuries BC) to conceal the fact that Tuthmosis III, not Abraham, was the father of Isaac, and therefore also the founding father of the 12 tribes of Israel. The first part of the Pharaoh's name, ―Tuth‖ (or Tho th) becomes Dwd, in Hebrew, the word used for ―David‖ in the Bible - Ahmed Osman ( Christianity: An Egyptian Religion ) The covenants between god and Moses were in fact covenants between Aton and Akhenaton. This revelation gives incredible relevance to the p assages from the early books of the bible. To understand the world of the past and the world of today it is essential that the passages are, for the most part, seen to be references to Earthly and political intrigues and not spiritual ones. ...your wife will bear you a son and you will call him Isaac. I shall establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him - Gen 17:19 And God said to him: I am, and my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations - G en 17:4 “... your wife will bear you a son and you will call him Isaac. I shall establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him - Gen 17:19 The exposure of the fraud concerning the lineage of Isaac places us on guard co ncerning every other aspect of the Abraham story. If anyone was \"fathering\" nations it appears to have been the pharaohs . Abraham was father of three different divisions of people; through Hagar the bond - maiden he became the father of the Ishmaelites, the Arabs, millions of them. Through another bond - maiden, Keturah, he became the father of other countless millions of eastern Hebrews, many of them living today in India; and only through Sarah, his rightful wife, did he become the father of the \"Children of the Promise.\" - Fredrick Haberman ( Tracing Our Ancestors ) The great Yuya was not only the appointed vizier to the pharaoh Tuthmosis IV, his dream - analyst and keeper of his granaries, etc, etc, but he was also the son - in - law of the high priest of the Solar Cult. Revisionist historians have also revealed that Aye, the uncle of Akhenaton and pharaoh after Tutankhamun was the son of Joseph the patriarch of the Levites (Jews). They have proven that Joseph's daughter Tiye was married to pharaoh Amenhotep III, th e father of Akhenaton; that Tuthmosis III was the prototype for King David, and that Amenhotep III was the prototype for King Solomon. Mary (the Mother of Jesus) may be based upon Nefertiti or Akhenaton's second wife Kiyah who was also known as Mery, meani ng \"beloved.\" Mary Magdalene has been traced back to Ankhsenpaaten, the wife of Smenkhare.

Saul is quite clearly a rendering of Sol , the name for the sun. The mythographers added his spurious life - story as an accent to suggest, as subtly as they w ere able, that King David's line was a continuation of the Sol Cult. Furthermore, it has been finally proven that the Aton - worshipping \"monotheist\" Akhenaton was the prototype for the biblical Moses. The implausible yarn about the birth and life of Moses, as has been hitherto presented in the Old Testament, has perpetually confounded and vexed the minds of researchers. His Egyptian name, his privileged upbringing in the royal house of pharaoh, his status, his \"serpent staff\" in the desert, his expulsion, hi s meeting with the god of Israel that he does not recognize, his monomania for freeing the \"chosen people\" (when they had never been captives), have never been satisfactorily explained - until now . Moses' brother was Aaron and he has been linked to the pha raoh Smenkhare, considered by some to have been the brother of Akhenaton. ...the so - called Five Books of Moses are the literary product of an age much later than the one in which Moses is supposed to have lived - Arthur Dewes ( The Christ Myth ) A very little research reveals that there was nothing new with the story of this \"Moses.\" A little digging into the mythology of the Persians, Babylonians, Chaldeans, Indians, and Assyrians, and we discover the entire tale presented on the life of this \"Moses\" to be a p lagiarization of much earlier myths of solar heroes such as the Babylonian Nebo and Babylonian Lord Sargon who had lived over 2,000 years before Moses. W e can conclude that the story of Moses was concocted in somewhat of a hurry and without much care. Util ity was what mattered and the fact that the cover story was workable. The Jewish mythmongers simply adopted the anecdotes and transposed them onto their own concocted fictive character, a mythographic personality who had no physical existence. Their Moses was a stand - in for someone else, for a true - life figure that was not to be exposed to the light. The Assyrian prince Sargon also, being pursued by his uncle, is said to have been abandoned on the Euphrates in a basket made of reeds, to have been found by a water - carrier, and to have been brought up by him - a story the Jews have interwoven into the account of the life of their fabulous Moses - Arthur Dewes ( The Christ Myth ) They tell you that Moses never lived. I acquiesce. If they tell me that the story th at came from Egypt is mythology, I shall not protest; it is mythology.

Given the proofs for this contention that have emerged in the last decade or so, we know that we are. For the revealers of these intriguing connections, the satisfaction is undoubtedly derived from the light shone onto the origins of the biblical dramatis personae and the discovery of the authentic identity of these august figures who have commanded so much attention and re gard throughout time. But for us, the implications and consequences concerning these revelations are considerably more serious and compelling. They prompt us to ask some very pointed questions about why there has been duplicity and guile in the composition of the scriptures, and whether there are other secrets that may be in need of discovery. W e ask why the human race should have been so egregiously served and whether the descendants of these deceivers are still operating in the world. Indeed, the very mag nitude of their unscrupulousness must alert us to treat all we read, from Judeo - Christian sources, with great care and erudition and utmost objectivity Amenhotep III (the real King Solomon) with Levite wife Tiye, the mother of Akhenaton, the heretic king and first \"Monotheist\" There is not a single shred of evidence for any of the implausible biblical characters as they have been prese nted (Abraham, Isaac, Joseph, Saul, Solomon, David, Aaron, and Jesus, etc). This is because they are later interpolations. They were designed to resemble earlier figures who wished to be remembered and lauded even though concealment was their over - arching priority. The bible is their story, their history, its many imperfections a clever mask of mystique designed to evoke reactions of awe, frustration, intrigue, and suspicion.

It is only when we match in detail the Old Testament account of his exploits with the reign of Amenhotep III that it becomes clear we are dealing with the same person - Ahmed Osman As the Bible story progresses, we are led to believe that the great royal house of David and Solomon gained its office because a shepherd - boy slew a giant with a stone. We are told absolutely nothing about its sovereign descent from the mighty dynasties o f Mesopotamia and Egypt, and yet this is the book upon which oaths are sworn to tell ̳the truth, and nothing but the truth‘ in courts of law - Laurence Gardner ( Genesis of the Grail Kings ) As much as Israel is one of the most archeologically researched nat ions in the world, very little of what is in the Bible can be confirmed. The only evidence of the existence of David comes by way of two separate inscriptions of a Davidic dynasty; nothing can be found about David personally - Raymond Hewitt (US Bible) For all their reported wealth and power, neither David nor Solomon is mentioned in a single known Egyptian or Mesopotamian text. And the archaeological evidence in Jerusalem for the famous building projects of Solomon is nonexistent - Israel Finkelstein and N eil Asher Silberman ( The Bible Unearthed ) The statement that Solomon commanded a vast army and was overlord of a huge empire that underwent decline during his reign finds no historical support in the tenth century BC - Moustafa Gadalla ...it is highly unli kely that this sparsely inhabited region of Judah and the small village of Jerusalem could have become the center of a great empire stretching from the Red Sea in the south to Syria in the north - ibid Despite its validity and importance, this kind of \"fin d the lemon\" game is somewhat less titillating to us than the exposure of the royal crime - families who not only commissioned the authoring of the bible but who have sought, age after age, to tear the hearts out of Truth, Justice, and Virtue.

The True Hebrews ...in 500 BCE, when Ezra collected the writings together, \"Jews\" were merely members of the tribe of Judah. They weren't special, and there was no \"Judaism\". The Levites had always controlled the re ligion, and Judah followed. It was Levite - ism. Even the most important Biblical book of rules, Leviticus, is named after them - Tony Malone ( The Zionist Manifesto: What is Judaism? ) The Cult of Aton left Egypt along with the elite class of Levites who had lived and served alongside them at Akhetaten (Tell el - Amarna), Avairs, Giza, Heliopolis, and Tanis. These tribes are put before us today as the \"Israelites,\" the supposed \"Jews\" of history. In fact these latter groups were subservient in all ways to the At onist Elders who were either biologically or ideologically descended from the Hyksos pharaohs of old. A reading of both versions of the Bible reveals that there were two classes of people who were involved in the Exodus. There were the Yahuds, the priestly class, and there were the Children of Israel, the commoners, the \"multitudes\" - Messod and Roger Sabbah ( Secret of the Exodus ) Those who became known as \"Jews\" were, however, originally neither Israelites nor Hebrews, and were not racially Semitic. The te rm Hebrew (and possibly also Jew ) comes from the Old Irish Iur , and the Irish Gaelic Ibur or Iburu meaning \"Yew Tree,\" or \"Men of the Yew.\" The yew tree was considered very sacred to the Druids and Egyptian Magi. The Ibaru (or Ibri, Abri, or Abari) turn up in Egypt as the \"W ise Ones\" or \"Elders.\" The letter \"H,\" added as a prefix, simply meant \"the,\" and so the word Hebrew meant \"the Ebru\" or \"the Ibaru.\" This is the origin of the word Iberia which signified Spain and Hibernia which signified Ireland. The w ord rabbi is a rendition or variant of this ancient name Abari or Ibaru . The Ibaru were Druidic Elders who had traveled to Egypt in remote periods and who had brought solar worship there. They were probably akin to the predynastic Shemsu Hor or \"Disciples of Horus,\" the tall, fair - complexioned, technically proficient race whose remains were found in tombs in Nubia by the eminent archaeologist Professor W alter B. Emery. This word Ibaru had a similarity to Apiru (Egyptian Apir ) which meant \"wanderer,\" \"undesi rable,\" \"shepherd,\" or \"foreigner.\" This unfortunate similarity of etymology has caused great confusion but has favored the machinations of those elites who crave to obscure the truth of their Western ancestry.

If one feels bound to understand the history of Israel as a revision of the Bible's traditions, one must admit the near total lack of warrant that these stories have for being accepted as historical - Thomas L. Thompson ( The Mythic Past, Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) The Levitical scholars and later historians knew that the real meaning of the title Hebrew (like that of \"David,\" \"Israel,\" \"Judah,\" and \"Aar on,\" etc) had to be obscured. The word's original meaning would best be concealed if it was linked to another similar sounding word that did denote racial types and groups. It was noted that the word was similar to Apiru which referred to thieves, wanderer s, and vagabonds, or to simple shepherds seeking refuge in Egypt due to droughts. Such refugees did exist and were bound to sustain themselves in Egypt by performing menial tasks. W ith the letter \"H \" added we have Hapiru, making a word that could easily be mistaken for Hebrew. But the Apiru or Hapiru were not the same people as the Hebrews or Ibaru , the wise - ones and counselors to pharaoh. The Irish (Aryan) Magi had journeyed far and wide and had established mystery schools throughout the far - flung corners of the globe, in every empire and major city. The early Egyptians knew them as the Shemsu Hor or \"Disciples of Horus.\" Intelligent and creative men aspired to attend their colleges and learn their secrets pertaining to astronomy, biology, horticulture, met aphysics, law, divination, and other subjects. The fact that almost every overt reference to these colleges has been deliberately excised from the world's history texts does not change this fact. In a similar fashion as the later Christian missionary monks , the Druids had taken their knowledge and symbolism with them wherever they roved. As a result, Druid Elders were exalted counselors at major courts. As Merlin was to King Arthur, the Druid Magi tutored the many princes and kings who sought them out. They were especially esteemed in Egypt, the land that had benefited from their knowledge of architecture and astronomy. The Druids (the Shemsu Hor) were counselors to, and perhaps even initiators of, the pharaohs of Egypt."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Hebrew is very seldom a word that the ancient Israelites use to describe themselves - Graham Philips ( Act of God ) The word Hebrew can also be traced to the Gaelic Heber meaning \"fire\" or \"sun.\" A \"Hebrew\" (Ibaru) was a priest of the sun.

Thompson ( The Mythic Past, Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) The Egyptian language confirms what we are saying about these intriguing terms. In Egyptian, the word Eebre (Hebrew Eber ) referred to rivers and water. The reference here was most probably to the Nile and to the schools of the Hebrew that existed along that great river. W ith the \"H\" added to the beginning of th e word, we have \"the Eber,\" meaning \"men of the river.\" Rivers were always considered sacred to the ancients. The Rhine river, for instance, takes its name from the Germanic word Rune meaning \"sacred knowledge,\" or \"source of wisdom.\" Men of the River, the refore, referred to those of the \"Underground Stream\" of Hermetic knowledge. In the Papyrus of Hunefer, of the Egyptian Book of the Dead , we see Osiris enthroned upon the sacred river, or pool of water, from which arises the papyrus plant with the four son s of Horus. This is certainly not the only word that suffered corruption at the hands of desecrators. There are many, many others. The use of vowels was limited in alphabets such as Hebrew, Egyptian, Latin, and Greek, and this anomaly doubtless assisted th ose who have used language to deceive.

He lays out the schemata for the ritual and dramatic performances customary to the Eleusinians: Eleusis - The Beginning or Opening Hierophant - The Magus Overseein g the Rites Hupereet - Ordinary Priest, or Minister Diaconos - A Deacon, or Lower Officer Diadochos - Torch - Bearer Photagogue - Bringer and W ielder of Light Autoptos - Candidate W itnessing the Rite"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Autopsy - The Act of W itnessing or Seeing Hebrew - The Ini tiated One (who has passed through all trials and been purified) Teleios - The Perfected Adept Israelite - The Purified, God - Inspired Adept (the \"God Seer\") Jew - God Himself. The State of Perfection. Man as Enlightened Being. The priests who presided over the Eleusinian mystery tradition were known as the Prorrhesis (note the term esis , or esus , the name of the Druidic vegetation god). Eleusis was a town not far from Athens that was named after the god Aten or Aton. We believe Athens to have been a major c enter of Atonism. Ralph Ellis has traced the eighteenth dynasty pharaoh Aye, the uncle of Akhenaton, to Athens, and he believes Aye's influence over the elites of Athens to be the reason for the naming of the renowned city. Eleusis was connected with Perse phone and Demeter, a duad based on the Egyptian goddesses Isis and Hathor. The festivals and rites of Eleusis began during the sign of Virgo the Virgin (mid September). The cult of the goddess and the reputation of the rites of Eleusis eventually spread to Rome gaining many eminent adherents there. The rites of Eleusis were basically Dionysian in character and they involved the use of hallucinogenic substances. The Eleusinians would repeatedly chant the name Iacchus, that referred to Dionysus, a god based o n the Egyptian Horus and Druidic Esus. So, in light of this, we have no difficulty placing the Hebrews or, more correctly, the Ibaru . They were the \"Initiators,\" the \"keepers of knowledge,\" the \"wise - ones,\" the Druidic Elders of Ireland and Britain whose c olleges once existed even in the far - flung corners of the globe. The ancient name for the land of Ireland was Hibernia and the Irish were known as Hibernians. This is a Gaelic word and it also denoted those tribes that inhabited Spain. (Spain's olden name was Iberia. ) In short, the original \"Hebrews\" - were Irish . The word Hebrew most likely comes from Ibiru , Ibaru , or Iburu meaning \"Yew Tree.\" The word Yahweh (meaning Jehovah) comes from Yehew or Yew . The reference in the Old Testament to Moses meeting god at a \"burning bush\" is yet one more biblical corruption of Druidic tree lore and stellar mythology.

If anything, it is more likely that Eastern migrants merely used these place - names because they understood that the countries to which they went were ancient homelands of the Ibaru. To obscure the anomaly concerning the name of Ireland, the historians disseminated the story that it was traveling Israelites or Hebrews fr om the East who, upon their arrival in Ireland, named it Hibernia . Such migrations did take place but were of later times. They occurred during the centuries AD. Many groups settled in Ireland for one reason or another and many came from the Levant. Howeve r, there was little that these people could teach the Irish. Such a notion is not only preposterous but it demonstrates the level of perfidy of the historians who have suggested such nonsense. The ancients knew that the terms Israelite and Ibaru referred t o high - ranking, spiritually endowed Egyptians and their ancestors. And they knew that Egypt had been visited numerous times by vagabonds and ne'er - do - wells out for what they could get. The outlying provinces of Egypt were often plagued by such miserables w ho stole food, polluted wells, and generally caused a disturbance. More than once did the Egyptian governors take to banishing and exiling foreigners who were preying upon their people.

After the exodus, it is the pagans who usually refer to the Jews as Hebrews, whereas the Jews usually refer to themselve s as Israelites.

These terms were falsely and duplicitously adopted and attributed at a much later d ate. The exodus described in the Old Testament is certainly and patently a preposterous fiction, but one that conceals facts of enormous interest and import. Unlike other pharaohs the spiritual and moral vacuity in the visages of Akhenaton, and his crew, palpably stands out. Their features betray hubris, narcissism, and mercilessness. Let us remember that name changing was common in the anci ent world. Akhenaton himself had changed his name from Amenhotep. The hordes who tended Akhenaton and his court, and who accompanied him after his exile, were Levites from the city of Avaris (Zoan or Zion) and Amarna. They were descendants of the Hyksos Ki ngs who had invaded Upper (Southern) Egypt over 300 years before (at the opening of the 13th dynasty). No, the \"Israelites\" were not the people who accompanied the pharaoh; they were the pharaoh and his immediate Egyptian coterie. Tradition maintains that Moses was a Levite. This seems a transparent distortion of the actual state of affairs: the Levites were Moses' people...in later times we find Egyptian names only among the Levites - Sigmund Freud ( Moses and Monotheism ) What is more, the Cult of Aton was certainly also feared. They had powerful enemies but also powerful and wealthy allies inside and outside of Egypt. The vast majority in Egypt despised them, but those who stood in their way were either crushed or undermined. Their patented strategy of dip lomacy versus military threat would continue to the present age. From their time in Egypt they had ties with the Cretans, Sumerians, Phoenicians, Hindus (Brahmins) and Babylonians, and with the \"House of Judah\" resident in Tanis.

W e are to lay our indictments against world tyranny at the door of this megalomaniac, as well as at those of his equally sadistic lieutenants, the founders of the world's anti - huma n religions. Blinded by the solar theocracy, modern man remains enslaved and existentially vagrant. It is a pity that modern men and women cannot awaken and, like the Egyptian people thousands of years ago, free themselves of this accursed Luciferian cult of the sun that has wrought so much misery upon the Earth."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 39 . The Atonists Divide Among the greatest riddles of Jewish prehistoric times is that concerning the antecedents of the Levites. They are said to have been derived from one of the twelve tribes of Israel, the tribe of Levi, but no tradition has ever ventured to pronounce on where that tribe originally dwelt or what portion of the conquered country of Canaan had been allotted to it. They occupied the most important priestly positions, but yet they were distinguished from the priests. A Levite is not necessarily a priest: it is not the name of a caste - Sigmund Freud ( Moses and Monotheism ) In Jewish studies it is important to realize the distinction (however fabricated it may or may not be) between the ten tribes of Israel (the \"Israelites\") and the two tribes of Judah (the \"Jews\"). The two groups were rarely friends or closely knit. Once the twelve tribes had settled in Palestine they divided themselves into two separate regions or kingdoms ruled by two separate kings. The ten Israelite tribes settled in the lands to the north of \"Israel\" and the two tribes of Benjamin and Levi (the Judites, Jews, or Levites) inhabited an area south of Israel known as Judah. The Tribe of Judah (from Yahud) is reported to have had its capital at Jerusalem. Kings David and Solomon belonged to the Kingdom of Judah. It is this Tribe of Judah that was, in our estimation, Atonist . They were, as the Targum (Aramaic bible) tells us, great and powerful priests in Egypt . It is from them that the Messianic tradition comes. A reading of both versions of the Bible reveals that there were two classes of people who were involved in the Exodus. There were the Yahuds, the priestly class, and there were the Children of Israel, the commoners, the \"multitudes\"...the Aramaic Bible makes a clear distinction between the Hebrews (Children of Israel) and the Yahuds...When the people of the Exodus reached Canaan, the Yahuds established themselves as the Kingdom of Judah and the multitud e formed the Kingdom of Israel - Messod and Roger Sabbah ( Secret of the Exodus ) The little tribe from the south, Judah, became identified with the landless tribe, that of the Levites. These hereditary priests, who claimed that their office had been bestowe d on them by Jehovah on Mount Sinai, were the true fathers of Judaism. They wandered among the tribes, preaching that the war of one was the war of all, and Jehovah's war. Their aim was power and they strove for a theocracy, a state in which God is the sov ereign and religion the law - Douglas Reed ( Controversy of Zion ) The existence of the tribe of Benjamin was also very peculiar. Its territory was small and almost entirely occupied by Canaanites...The Benjamites were little else than a special military cor ps...They were not liked, and their morality was said to be very low - Ernest Renan ( History of the People of Israel , 1894)"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Modern \"Jews\" believe themselves descended from the Tribe of Judah since the ten other tribes of the northern kingdom of Israel are considered \"lost.\" Allegedly, they were scattered after being taken into captivity by King Sargon II's Assyrian army in the year 722 BC. Later, around the year 586 BC, the House of Judah was attacked by the Babylonians who allegedly took the Judites and Le vites (and many Israelites who had attempted to take refuge in Judah) into captivity. From this point on the twelve tribes were never again to be united. After the Babylonians were themselves conquered by the Persian king Cyrus, the Jews of the House of Ju dah were released and allowed to return home. By this time the tribes of Israel had already been scattered. The Catholic Encyclopedia summarizes the situation: When the unfortunate schism took place under Roboam only the tribe of Juda and of Benjamin remai ned faithful to the House of David (1 Kings 12:20), and henceforth the Southern Kingdom was known as that of Juda. After the Captivity the members of Juda were among the first to return to Jerusalem and begin the reconstruction of the Temple (Ezra 1:5; 3:9 ); in fine, the name \"Jews\" (Judaei), by which the post - Exilic Israelites and their descendants are generally designated, is, of course, derived from Juda. Thus the history of the Chosen People is to a great extent the story of the varying vicissitudes of the dominant tribe of Juda. Its military ascendancy and glory reached its height in the person of David, the \"lion of Juda\". But the true lion of the tribe of Juda is Christ the Son of David The people known at present as the Jews are descendants of the tr ibes of Judah and Benjamin with a certain number of the tribe of Levi - Rabbi J. H. Hertz (statement made in 1918) W e suggest that the major rifts between the \"Tribes\" (if they existed in the way portrayed) had a great deal to do with Akhenaton and his des tiny. In our mind there is no difference between the Judites and the Atonists. The bible, albeit cryptically, tells us as much: And on the east side, toward the rising of the sun, shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armie s - (Numbers 2:3) Judah is a lion's whelp - (Genesis 49:9) The former are not \"Jews,\" in the sense known today. They were Egyptians and were worshippers of the sun. They were descendants of the priesthood of the many solar temples. This is the true definit ion of a \"Levite.\" The Atonism of these cults is before us still in the guise of modern Judeo - Christianity. It is purveyed by the Vatican, by Freemasonry, by Templarism, and by many other related societies and institutions. After the Captivity of Assyria - Israel was the first to fall, and had their entire kingdom destroyed by the Assyrians who deported them off to the shores of the Caspian Sea area. The deportation was complete around 721 BC. About 100 years later the"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Assyrians were destroyed by the Babylo nians. The Israelites were then freed but instead of returning home, ventured out to the western lands - W. H.

Those who think of themselves as religious Jews are, like the Gentiles, treated b y the executive of Levitical Atonists with the same haughty and even murderous contempt. They may worship Jehovah but do so without being privy to his true identity. They raise their arms in church and synagogue in the same manner as the ancients did when venerating the sun and they utter \"Amen \" at the end of prayers with no thought as to the Irish or Egyptian origins of what they do. To the Atonists ordinary Jews are a class below, and not worthy of distinction. Their existence merely serves as useful camo uflage and as a way to lead attention away from the ruling quorum. The student of the controversy of Zion has to plod far before he begins to unveil its mysteries, but very soon discovers that in all things it speaks with two tongues, one for \"the heathen\" and one for the initiates - Douglas Reed When the so - called \"United Monarchy\" allegedly existed, under Benjaminite Saul, the Levites had their first king outside Egypt. W e can deduce the nature of the god and the cult that this first official monarch of t he Jews ruled for, given that his name was Saul - from Sol (the sun). His successor was the famous King \"David.\" But this word did not denote a personal name, for it was only a title given to the military commanders of the Solar Cult. The emblem for this t itle was the dove - from dovid or david . The genocidal exploits of these first two commanders of the Houses of Israel and Judah were strangely recorded in the Old Testament. Perhaps, the inclusion of these accounts of death, mutilation, and wonton destruct ion, was deemed necessary as a propaganda device. The Levites and their masters wanted the power, might, and ruthlessness of their god understood by all. As all tyrants and demagogues know, it is fear not love that ensures power and privilege. Moreover, ps ychopathic people do not regard their own deeds as being deranged. On the contrary, they think them quite sane and right. And so, in light of this, the recording of heinous acts of unimaginable cruelty would not seem abnormal or obscene to Atonist editors. The pragmatic boardroom executive responsible for numerous closures, job losses, and bankruptcies, considers his inhuman decisions and actions to be justified and inevitable. The power - crazed Atonist commander who believes that \"the world is not enough,\" and who sends his armies to decimate neighboring nations, also considers his actions quite justified. The only difference between the corporate executive"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"and Atonist general is that the former does not believe himself to be directed and rewarded by god alm ighty. Whether it is true or allegorical, the importance lies in the plain implication: Jehovah demanded literal obedience when he commanded \"utter destruction\" and mercy or pity were capital offences - Douglas Reed ( Controversy of Zion ) Jewish history sta tes that the Israelites of the Northern kingdom did not accept the tyrant King David from the House of Judah in the south. They knew that his rule was a arranged in order to gain control over their territory. From this point onward the two houses - of Jews (Judah) and Israelites (Israel) - parted company. W e can surmise that it was at this point that the main body of the Israelites (so called) did not agree with the Atonist plan for world domination. Or it may have been a disagreement between the priests ov er the celestial change of the sun from the House of Taurus into Aries, that precipitated the rift. The scenes at Sinai tend to indicate that it was this astrological phenomenon that caused problems for the Atonists and their followers. Akhenaton had proba bly perished at Tanis or at Sinai soon after the final expulsion from Egypt by Seti I. His descendants - the \"Davids\" who ruled in his name - wanted nothing less than to build another power state to rival all others. They conceived of a grand plan to estab lish a New W orld Order that would, if need be, be erected upon the ruins and wreckage of the world's infidel nations. They had absolutely no care or respect for the inhabitants of other lands and had no problem plotting their subjugation. After all, the At onists had been royalty. In their minds they still were. Nothing in that regard had changed. Their leader was pharaoh not only of Egypt but of the entire world. All nations bowed before his rod and scepter. The sovereignty of other nations was a fiction. M oreover, the people beyond the borders of Egypt were unholy infidels. Between the belligerent, super - racist, Atonist ideology motivating the tyrants of bygone days, and that of today's imperialistic royal houses and governments, there is not a jot of diffe rence. The land into which you go, to possess it, is an unclean land with the impurity of the people of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from one end to the other with their uncleanness. now therefore do not give your daughters to th eir sons. And do not take their daughters for your sons or seek their peace of their wealth forever, so that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your sons forever - (Ezra 9:11 - 12) Be very careful, as you value your life, to love Yahweh your God. But if you prove faithless, if you make friends with the remnant of those peoples who are still left beside you, if you form kinships with them and intermarry, then know for certain that Yahweh, your God, will no longer drive these peoples before you; instead, they will be a snare and a pitfall for you, a scourge to your sides and thorns in your eyes, till you vanquish from this good land which Yahweh your God has given you - (Joshua 23:11 - 13)"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Do not make yourselves uncle an by any of these practices, for it was by such things that the nations that I have expelled to make way for you made themselves unclean. The land became unclean. I exacted the penalty for its fault, and the land had to vomit out its inhabitants - (Lev 18 :24 - 25) Naturally, the sane among the Atonists wanted nothing to do with such monstrous scheming. They soon decided to go their own way. Biblical tradition tells us that the \"chosen people\" lived together in Israel for about 500 years. After 250 years they chose to divide themselves into two \"Houses.\" Eventually, we are told that Israel was attacked and large portions of both Houses were taken into captivity by the Assyrians. The House of Judah (Aton) was particularly vulnerable since they were, unlike the Israelites, few in number. Allegedly, after their release by the Assyrians, the Judites and Israelites again suffered invasion and captivity at the hands of the Babylonians. After this period of bondage, the ten tribes of \"Israel\" decided not to return to their homes and Temple in Palestine but to emigrate Westward across the Caucasus Mountains and into the lands beyond. Only two tribes were still fanatical enough to allegedly make a return to Jerusalem, the \"Tribe of Benjamin\" and \"Tribe of Levi.\" It is fr om these tribes that Levitical Judaism arose. From this tradition came the Gaonim, the Sadducees, Zadokites, Khazars, and Kabalistic colleges that were instrumental in creating the smokescreens behind which the Cult of Aton would operate. Upon the death o f Solomon, a political crisis ensued, which was soon to bring about the disruption of the kingdom, splitting it into two parts. The tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which had remained faithful to Roboam, the son of Solomon, formed the realm of Judah, whose ca pital was Jerusalem. To its north, the ten other tribes established the realm of Israel, or Ephraim, with Samaria as capital - Robert Cornman and J. M. Modrzejewski ( The Jews of Egypt: From Rameses II to Emperor Hadrian ) When the twelve tribes, after their entry into Palestine, about 1445 BC, divided the land among themselves, the tribes of Dan and Simeon were located in the south between the coast an d the Dead Sea, with Judah and Benjamin north of them - Fredrick Haberman"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"These people are the Jews, which word is derived from Yehudim, meaning, according to Josephus, \"the remnant of Judea.\" Neither are these Jews pure Israelites...Generally, the Israeli tes were tall and fair, the cream of the Aryan Race, as we find them in the Irish Scots, the pure English, and the Norwegians; while the Jews the \"shew of their countenance doth witness against them,\" as Isaiah said - ibid Benjamin...who was loaned to Juda h as a \"light - bearer\" as seen from I Kings 11:36 and 12:21.

There i s little doubt in our mind that the accounts of the settlement in Israel, the building of the temple at Jerusalem, the development of the united monarchy, and the attack of hostile forces from Assyria and Babylon are largely concoctions. They were necessar y fictions giving the impression that the books of the bible were composed and compiled in Babylon instead of Rome. Moreover, it is difficult for us to believe that the \"chosen people\" were as homeless and comfortless as the bible reports. On the contrary, once we connect the dots we find that both theT Yahuds (Judites, Levites) and the Israelites from Egypt would have swiftly found new homes with their Hyksos kin who had been expelled a few centuries previously and who would have, by that time, found thems elves new homes in the many lands around Egypt. W e do not believe the Judites and Israelites to have been wanderers through any \"wildernesses\" for forty years. W e do not believe they suffered a day of such hardship. W e do believe that there was a schism be tween the factions after the expulsion. The Judites or Levites (Yahuds) were closely allied with Akhenaton's Cult of Aton and have been a front for them down through the ages until the present day. W hen this fanatical sect of Atonists realized the rest of their nation (the Israelites) did not care to continue with the plan and were disgruntled and vengeful they simply rejected and cursed them, and were cursed in return. The ten tribes have no share in the world to come - ( The Talmud ) Israel was conquered by the Assyrians, and led into Captivity. The Judahites, then and today consider the House of Israel lost from this time, due to their breaking of the Covenant. Judah, considered Israel ―dead.‖ - Douglas Reed ( The Controversy of Zion ) According to the Old Te stament, one of the reasons why the House of Israel chose to spurn the House of Judah was due to the latter's vile obsession not only with war but with human and animal sacrifice. One can split the Old Testament prophets into camps based upon whether they speak for the Judites or whether they remonstrate against them and their heinous practices."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"The Israelite prophets Amos, Hosea, and Jeremiah, were the staunchest opponents of the House of Judah (David) and throughout their narratives they cajole the Judite s, imploring them to abandon their godless practices, particularly the sacrifice of their firstborn sons. Few scholars chose to refer to this schism between the prophets of the Old Testament, or to draw attention to the depravity of this House of Judah tha t was despised even by its most kindred blood. It is worth pointing out, for what it is worth, that Judas the betrayer of Jesus (in the New Testament story) was a son of the Levities. The book of Jeremiah, like the book of Isaiah, is full of Levitical inte rpolations, long after these actual prophets lived. Jeremiah's actual words are remonstrations against the \"abominations\" of the priests of Judah. He spoke against the sacrifices of children - Douglas Reed ( Controversy of Zion ) I hate, I despise your feast s and take no delight in your solemn assemblies. Yea, though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them. Neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts - ( Book of Amos ) To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? Saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of goats...When ye spread forth your hands, I will not hear, for your hands are full of bl ood...If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat of the land. But if ye rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it - (Isaiah 1:11 - 19) The rivalry of the tribes alerts us to the fraudulence behind the naming of the m odern \"State of Israel.\" Israel as an entity has, according to every authentic and legitimate authority, long assimilated into the world's nations and has, as a result, long ceased to exist (if it ever did to begin with). The usage of such a term today esp ecially to name a homeland for \"Jews\" is the height of historical nonsense. The vast majority of Jews living in this \"Israel,\" like the majority of Jews anywhere in the world, are Jewish by simple religious conversion and not by ethnic or racial descent. . ..it was impossible for any Jew at this time to describe himself truthfully as of the tribe of Benjamin...the Benjaminites later intermarried with the tribe of Judah to such an extent that they lost their separate identity and all became Judites or Jews. O nly the Levites, the priestly tribe, and that section of the Levites called the Kohanim (Cohens) or priests (the descendants of Aaron) retained their identity because they needed to do so for cultic reasons. All other Jews were simply known as Israelites f or cultic purposes...and no distinction was made for any religious purpose between Judites or Benjaminites, so that there was no motive for preserving the distinction. Consequently, when Paul described himself as \"of the Tribe of Benjamin,\" this was sheer bluff, though the recipients of his letters, the Gentile converts to Christianity, were in no position to know this - Hyam Maccoby ( The Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity ) Because of the false but very common idea that the Jews of today are all that remain of the ancient Israel people, it becomes necessary here to point out that, with the"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"exception of a very few individuals, none of the ten - tribed house of Israel and only a very small remnant of the two - tribed House of Judah ever returned to Palestine after their deportation to Assyria and Babylon.

H. Bennett ( Symbols of our Celto - Saxon Heritage ) The Levites began the compilation of their suggestively named \"Law of Moses\" in the period following the alleged Ass yrian captivity, but before the Babylonian arrest, during the 7th century BC. Moses, of course, had long since passed from the scene and knew nothing of this Levitical Law composed in his name. From this point onward, what lord god Jehovah said was whateve r the Levites said he said . No one could argue the point since, before the \"Law\" and the Levites Book of Deuteronomy existed, nothing was written down. Nevertheless, the Levites declared themselves to be exceptional because Moses had handed down to them an oral tradition that remained undisclosed to the uninitiated. This fact alerts us since it is the perfect ruse by which the Atonists could disguise their identity from both Jews and Christians. The oral law was a secret law and so no outsider could have a clue what it said. This oral law dates from the time of Moses' ascent of Mount Sinai. The Book of Deuteronomy (\"Second Law\") concerns the oral tradition's precepts, and clearly shows an objective reader that the Levites were interested in only one thing, t hat is condemning and murdering everyone who stood against them. Religious intolerance could not have a better manifesto. And the weapon suggested to be used against the world by this Machiavellian dossier - was fear : The Lord spoke unto me saying...This d ay will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee - (Deuteronomy 2:25) One hundred years following the sacking and seizure of Israel, the Levites composed their ―Law,‖ epitomized in Deuteronomy which was read aloud in the temple. This was the birth of ―Mosaic Law‖ really created by the Levites and attributed to Moses. It is really Levitical or Judaic law. It is th eir ―political programme.‖ Deuteronomy means ―second law‖ because it stood distinct from the original Israelite law - Douglas Reed ( Controversy of Zion ) It is in this horrendous book of Mosaic Law that we find the proof of the relationship between Jehovah (Aton) and his Levitical his servants. From chapter seven we read of the \"holy\" work to be done: ...seven nations greater and mightier than thou...And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; th ou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them: Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.

Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them. The books like Deuteronomy have been many times revised and amended since 621 BC. This was done to tone the content down, to make it less repugnant to the Gentile nations. The originals were probably worse - Douglas Reed ( Controversy of Zion ) And in the Book of Exo dus (composed after Deuteronomy and Torah) we read of the covenant of blood that held the Levites together: Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you... From these same books we read of the duplicity and callousness employed to se cure their insidious Atonist agenda. W e read of the egregious methods employed to bring ruin to any kingdom, nation or people encountered along their way: When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it then proclaim peace unto it. And it shall be, i f it make thee answer of peace, open unto thee, then it shall be that all the people therein will pay tribute unto thee and serve thee. And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: and when the Lord th y God hath delivered it unto they hands thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: but the women, and the little ones and the cattle and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself...But of the cit ies of these people, which the Lord thy God hath given thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save nothing alive that breathest - (Deuteronomy 20:10) During the alleged Babylonian arrest under Nebuchadnezzar the Levites compiled and added four more books to D euteronomy. These four books became known as the Torah (from the Gaelic Tara - meaning \"Law\"). It is suggestive, and of great historical significance, that the Aton cult (and the majority of their Levite followers) decided, after their \"release\" from Babyl on by Cyrus the Great (in 537 BC), to not return after all to their beloved Jerusalem.

Of course, the theory is preposterous. First of all, if these Israelites were of Indo - European racial extraction it is hardly likely that they would begin of their own accord to mix their blood with foreigners, at least to the startling degree hinted at in the bible. Secondly, it has recently come to light that the Babylonians, Persians, and Syrians were of Indo - European racial stock themselves. So, while in captivity amongst the Babylonians it s eems a wonder that the Israelites would have found themselves able to locate the lower, diseased, and wretched foreign elements that caused them to later fall so low. This super - racism shows us the nature of the bible's authors as well as the depth of thei r duplicity. This clan who has long complained of the racism of nations and turns out to be so racist as to state without reservation that their own stock suffered racial contamination after a few years mixing with foreign elements. Clearly then, we have a gross distortion of history at work. The British - Israelite historians stand clearly in the light as deceivers and myth - mongers. They have set to work to negate their own traditions due to the scientific data on race that began to come forth in the 19th ce ntury. Disturbed by these revelations the Atonists commissioned this coterie to twist the truth, switch their position on previous assertions, and partly release truths concerning the racial type of the bible's holy people. Now, if we take their history as factual we have the high Indo - European Caucasian \"Israelites\" coming from the East to the lands of the W est to civilize and bring the true teachings to those who had not partaken of it already. From their intervention the pagan world becomes enlightened a nd moral. From them the world would accept the will of the one god - Jehovah . In any case, it was only the elite who decided not to return to the \"beloved\" homeland in the desert. And this decision tells us a great deal given our thesis of the actual ident ity of the so - called “Twelve Tribes.” Of course the great Atonists, the high priests of the sun, were not going to be overly attracted by the idea of returning to dusty Judea. That had merely been a temporary refuge. After their relatively pleasant sojourn in Babylon that was like Egypt a very cosmopolitan place the desire was to maintain the luxury to which they were accustomed.

God Moves House With the assistance of the author Ralph Ellis, we can clear away a lot of cobwebs and throw back a lot of drapes to get a clearer picture as to why the twelve tribes really decided to divide into separate groups and eventually part company. The previously asserted reasons for this division have not sufficiently been explained and, in our opinion, the notion that the division occurred due to outside interference (Assyrians and Babylonians) does not add up. If the division did not occur whilst the \"chosen people\" were in Egypt for all those years, why did it occur after they were exiled? And when external threats appear people tend to stick together and not fragment. According to Ralph Ellis the divi sion probably occurred due to the Cult of Aton's priestarchy who knew that a significant astrological change was taking place. This change or phase - shift concerned the sun's rise on the vernal equinox and the constellations that were seen just before sunri se on the first sign of the zodiac. For over 2,000 years, until the point of Joseph's arrival into Egypt, the sun had occupied the sign of Taurus - The Bull. This means that every year during the spring equinox, when the sun rises in the morning, it did so with the stars of Taurus behind it. Naturally, as the sun rises in the morning the stars fast fade from physical sight. But this did not matter to the Egyptian astrologers who knew what celestial (astrological) \"time\" it was. Now, as astronomers and astro logers know, the sun moves backwards through the twe lve signs of the zodiac, in a long cycle that is referred to as the \"Precession of the Equinoxes.\" The Precession of the Equinoxes - A most important astrological phenomenon, that can be used as a heuristic device to decode the Bible It moves very gradually, about 1 degree of arc every 72 years. Therefore, it takes over 2,160 years for the sun to pass backwards through a single sign of the zodiac. These signs or houses bear the familiar names: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces . Pisces is the sign that the sun \"occupies\" at th is time. In the days of Akhenaton, the sun had moved from the sign or house of Taurus (the Bull) into the sign or house of Aries (the Ram or Lamb). These changes of sign "},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":" were of extreme importance to the Magi of old for various reasons outside the scope of the present text. W hen the change occurred it signaled necessary ritualistic and even attitudinal changes below on Earth. The civilized races of antiquity observed these astrological changes and acted accordingly. Symbolism and mythology, as well as attit udes and beliefs morphed, and the heavenly changes of orientation were considered to be of vital importance. However, as the work of Ralph Ellis reveals, the priesthoods of Egypt were not all in agreement as to the position of the sun. Ellis claims t hat the Egyptians of the Northern or Lower part of Egypt, specifically at Heliopolis (under Hyksos dominion), were all for the celestial change. Since they were martially disposed, they ceased the worship of \"Taurean\" archetypes and switched to the worship of \"Arian\" ones instead. The bible is full of references to this solar phase - shift. For instance, when we read of \"lamb's blood\" being daubed on the portals of doorways, we are being told of this constellational change. When we hear of the Jewish priests blowing the \"ram's horn\" at the Eastern gate of the temple, we are being told of it, and when we hear of the sacrifice of the \"Paschal Lamb,\" the story is the same. The very term \"Passover,\" originally referred to this action of the sun literally passing o ver the hypothetical boundaries of the signs of the zodiac. The most important biblical rendition of the astrological story and dilemma concerns the time of the exiled Children of Israel at Mount Sinai. It was here that the people returned to the worship o f the \"golden calf,\" that is of Taurus. As the Book of Exodus relates, Moses was furious with his people's recalcitrance and smashed the tablets with his Yahwistic (Atonist) commandments on them. Certain cultures took to the wearing of horned helmets, ofte n to symbolize their acknowledgment of the Taurean Age. In India the custom of the sacred cow is also a relic from the astrological age of Taurus. The sacrifice of a lamb at this time of the year and the sacrifice of a Messianic figure (Lamb of God - Agni Deus ) are based on astrological phenomena. The spring sun is extremely hot and when it enters into the sign of Aries, the first sign of the zodiac it burns and incinerates the dampness and freeze of winter. This incinerating quality prompted priests to emp loy fire and sacrificial animals in their rituals, to commemorate the new - born sun, and its powerful rays of light. Another interpretation concerning this revelry states that the Children of Israel were rebelling against Moses and his Atonist Cult. They we re venerating the"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"golden calf in order to honor Pharaoh Heremheb whose name means \"Powerful Bull.\" By paying respect to this Heremheb and the Egyptian Amunists, the Children of Israel were hoping to gain favor and perhaps be allowed to make a return to Egy pt. Both the Aramaic and Hebrew bibles do make mention of the conflict at Sinai between Moses and the exiled people. The entire community of the Children of Israel began to murmur against Moses and against Aaron in the desert. And the Children of Israel sa id to them: We wish we had died by the hand of Adon in the land of Egypt, seated by the meat kettles and eating bread to the full. Because you have brought us out into this desert to kill all the people by starvation - (Exodus 16:2, Aramaic Bible) Since we do not believe the bible's account of the \"W ilderness\" story, we personally think this passage reveals discontent over status not food. The \"Children of Israel\" were indeed irate with their Atonist leaders for committing deeds resulting in the loss of Egy pt and the thrones of power. The disputes were political and were over the loss of authority, prestige, and power, and not over the lack of physical nourishment. After all, the bible admits that the Israelites were laden down with gold and treasure taken f rom the coffers from Egypt. The Hyksos kings and their people honored the astrological precession and began reverencing the traits and proclivities associated with the sign of Aries, whereas the priests of Thebes in Southern (or Upper Egypt) decided that the time was not right for new gods to be venerated. They wished to theologically remain loyal to the Taurean principles. This intriguing scenario allows us to hazard more than a guess as to why there was a schism between the tribes of \"Israel.\" The ten tr ibes decided that the old paradigm was still in, whereas the two tribes of Judah decided to honor their king Akhenaton and venerate the new Astro - Theological order. Although we may not appreciate the contrariness of the Israelites, we can liken it to the m ore recent The con flict between the exiled \"chosen people\" occurred due to the astrological shift of the sun, from the sign of Taurus (the Bull) to Aries (the Golden Calf). The Precessional change signaled a New World Order for Akhenaton, and it was to be obeyed by everyone upon the earth. Disloyalty to Aton was heresy and would not be tolerated."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"historical conflicts between denominations of the Christian church. Ellis gives the example of Northern Ireland where two contingents, of the same background and blood, violently differ on theological grounds. The fact that the Atonists and Judi tes decided to acknowledge Arian symbolism is more than confirmed by the Arian symbolism that they have subsequently employed. W e find Arian symbolism incorporated throughout the bible and also encoded into the architecture of the religious and civic world. Indeed, Arian symbolism continued to be employed by the descendants of the Atonists even after 2,160 years elapsed and the sun moved into the sign of Pisces (the last house of the zodiac). The falling out and schism resulted in animosity between the Houses of Israel and Judah. The propagandists of Judah believe the House of Israel to be accursed by Jehovah, and out of favor. They point to the slip back into idolatry at the foot of Mount Sinai, and then in Assyria, as the cause for Jehovah's (Aton's) dissatisfaction, but we know the real reason has to do w ith the reluctance of the Israelites to accept the new astrological paradigm of the Atonists.

And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah - (Gen 38:27 - 30) Another cover story that was concocted as a mask for the Atonist quorum to hide behind is that concerning Judah's twin sons Zarah and Pharez. This wholly fictive tale is the m onomania of the Zionist British - Israelite coterie who are major propagandists for the Atonists. The \"history\" they have been funded to spawn is designed to lead our attention away from the question concerning the entrance of Abraham into Egypt and the pare ntage of his son Isaac, the so - called \"father\" of the Twelve Tribes of Israel and Judah. This unofficial wing of the Freemasonic Order was also appointed to counter the findings of twentieth century anthropologists and archaeologists that served to inciner ate the tangled webs of lies spun by the spider - men of Aton concerning the history of the world and the migration of races. Their obsession centered on Genesis Chapter 38, and I Chronicles Chapter 6, and the verses that tell of the lineage of Judah. the so n of Jacob and patriarch of the House of David. This lineage is believed by British - Israelites to still exist today, having come down through one of Judah's twin sons, known as Zarah (meaning \"seed\"). The second twin is known as Pharez (meaning \"breached\" but which may be related to Pharos meaning \"light\"). The lineage of Judah - Zarah is referred to as \"The Scarlet Thread.\" This term derived from the birth saga of Judah's twins. According to the fantastic story, the midwife tied a red thread around the wris t of Pharez, the first twin to appear. However, Pharez retracted his hand with the thread and it was Zarah who first came forth. Judah's first - born was thereafter the one to carry forward the royal dynasty of \"David.\"(\"David\" being a title for commanders a nd chieftains of the Levites and Hyksos pharaohs of Lower Egypt). This anecdote about the red thread is the origin of the modern rhetoric concerning being caught in \"red tape\" or being \"in the red\" (courtesy of Akhenaton) and so on.

Our suspicions are heightened thanks to the exposes of Ralph Ellis. Our Zarah is the son of Judah, the son of Jacob, the br other of Joseph (recorded as being the \"dream analyst\" of Pharaoh Tuthmosis IV) but who was more likely Yuya of the Hyksos line of pharaohs.

Ellis has shown t hat there is a connection between the legendary St. George the dragon slayer and the god Set who also entered into combat with the serpent Apophis, using a spear to overcome his serpentine adversary. One of the meanings of the Egyptian word Set is \"garter. \" The name also means \"secret.\" Like the ancient worshippers of Set, and like the Egyptian nobility, the Knights of the Garter wear a blue - colored band upon their person. It is usually hidden from view, or kept \"secret.\" But a look at the symbolism of vari ous corporations and government bodies reveals much use of the \"blue ribbon\" or blue band or tie. A Master Mason is bestowed a jewel upon a blue ribbon. St. Michael is a variation of St. George. In Egyptian, the name Michael is makel, meaning \"blue.\" The k nightly connection is made sensible when it is realized that the god Set was often the tutelary deity for commanders in the Egyptian military. He was considered a god of war and conflict. He presided over the hot red deserts, and over storms and natural di sasters. In Egyptian, a title for Set was Djeudje (pronounced Djoogee ). This is the probable origin of the name adopted by so many British kings - George . The name refers directly to the god Set. And Set had been the original god of the Hyksos dynasty who later became followers of Akhenaton and his Atonists. It appears that the flag of England, that contains the Setian red cross and blue background, is nothing less than an Atonist flag, pure and simple. The pharaonic crown of Lower Egypt, the area dominated by the Hyksos, was known as the Deshret or \"red crown.\" Ergo, it is not St. George who is the patron saint of England, but Set of the Hyksos.

"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"Aton and the Fool The Hebrew letter that corresponds t o this card is Aleph . Aleph, from the Arabic Aleim and Irish Ailim , is the origin of the modern word Alive. The Irish Ailim gives our first letter of the alphabet \"A.\" It became the Hebrew Aleph and the Greek Alpha . The first letter of the Egyptian alphabe t was Ahom . The hieroglyphic for this letter was an eagle. The eagle stood for the first letter. Since the Arabic term Aleim (and Hebrew Aleph ) symbolized the gods, the eagle (and also hawk or falcon) became the prime insignia of the gods. Authors Messod a nd Roger Sabbah show how the letter Aleph is connected to the Egyptian hieroglyphic that stood for \"Aton\" representing light. The letter therefore commemorated the connection between Akhenaton's House of Aton and the House of Judah (or Yahud). Additionally , the term Elohim that derives from Ailim and Aleim can still be found in Jerus - alem. Interestingly, an interesting confirmation of the Atonist sig nificance of the letter \"A,\" concerns the first card of the Tarot that corresponds to the letter Aleph. The imagery of the card features an Atonist sun disk. We also see the solar child representing Akhenaton emerging from the solar orb like a physical ema nation or beam of light. The Ankh was the symbol for breath, and this is the beginning of Akhenaton's name (\"Ankh Aton\"). So, Aleph (or \"breath\") is the first letter \"A,\" while Ankh (the symbol for \"breath\") is the first hieroglyphic of Akhenaton's own nam e. Clearly then the image in the card is a cryptic reference to Akhenaton. That he descends from a mountain peak connects him to the biblical Moses. The Egyptian hieroglyphic for the letter \"A\" was an eagle. The symbol of the eagle can be seen on the bag c arried by the \"Fool.\" The word Fool is a corruption of the world Soel . The long letter \"S\" was often mistaken for \"F.\" Soel or Sol, means \"the Sun.\" Again, the reference is to Aton. Furthermore, the body posture of the Fool loosely formulates the Hebrew le tter Aleph. In other words, his body is the letter \"A,\" for Aton. The Fool is the Jester or Joker of conventional playing decks. Zoroaster, a nd Zoroastrianism . A solar - cult mystery religion that developed in Persia around 1200 BC, shortly after the time of the removal of Akhenaton from Egypt. This solar based religion is uncannily similar to Atonism. It preceded Christianity. Zoroaster may have been a prototype for Paul's Jesus. Zoroastrianism was prominent under the Sassanid Empire of Persia (modern Iran). It is not known whether Zoroaster was a historical figure. Dates for his existence vary widely, anything from 2000 BC to 458 BC. The term zo ro, means \"golden\" and is close to sura or surya , meaning \"sun.\" Zoroaster , is taken to mean \"golden star.\" He is considered the creator of the Magi who really go back much further, and who had western origins. Zoroastrianism plays a role in the Masonic tr adition. The god of Zoroaster was known as Hormuzd , Ormuzd or Ahura Mazda , god of light. Apparently, he was a version of Horus, Amun Ra, and Aton. In Mozart's Masonic opera The Magic Flute, the character sarstro is portrayed the fount of all wisdom "},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":" The Cult of Mithras - A Hellenistic Solar Cult that thrived in the second century BC during the time of the Roman Empire. It particularly attracted men from the Roman military, and was very popular among the Romans in general. The sun god Mithras (Mith Ra) overcomes the bull of Taurus. Mithras represents the sun moving from the sign of Taurus into Aries. This astrological phase - shift had obsessed Akhenat on and his Atonists. Their god was the sun, and the sun's relative position in the heavens mattered greatly to his \"Watchers.\" During the time when the sun made its transition from Taurus into Aries, Egyptians priests were at odds. Some wished to continue with the old paradigm, while others hailed the change. The scene at Mount Sinai, in which the \"Chosen People\" build a \"golden calf\" cryptically refers to this schism in the ranks. The Cult of Mithras was not much different from the Sol Invicti Cult to whic h Emperor Constantine belonged. And both Cults were, in our mind, variants of Egyptian Atonism.

Most Jews are not Semitic, so the stigma of Anti - Semitism is most often misapplied. One of the devices used by the Jesuit - Atonist Establishment to focus attention away from themselves, and toward the complicit Zionist fac tions in their employ, was the work known as \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\" This book, like the very Talmud itself, is indeed authored by the \"Elders of Zion,\" although not the ones most people who know of the strange text believe. The publication has done its work perfectly to set one side against the other in an entertaining faux conflict to those architects who enjoy the spectacle of misinformation and ignorance.

The trail of the past, of the descent through time of Akhenaton and his Cult, had to be concealed and Mosaic Judaism offered imperfect cover. It was a li ability, since a close reading of the Judaic religion eventually exposes its Egyptian roots. Christ would be from a heavenly realm far above confines of the the world.

The learned know it; and t he unlearned better not know it - William Penn That the New Testament analysis as we know it only began in the nineteenth century reflects the almost superstitious reluctance to examine the original texts that came out of the Church‘s age - long prohibition on Bible reading for the masses. For centuries only priests read the Scriptures - in fact, in most cases they had the monopoly of literacy - Picket and Prince ( Templar Revelation ) Little of the oriental history we are exploring would matter more than a jot if it were not for the fact that many of the most powerful dynasties and families in control of the present world's religions and governments happen to be either physically or ideologically descended from this Atonist Dragon Court. The lineages and lines of descent are extremely well covered up. One of the strategies employed to ensure that we do not \"get the picture\" of who's really who in the world involves focusing the limelight upon those with no legitimate connection to the ancient world. The Jews who exist today, who are Jewish by simple religious conversion, have no racial or national connection to the so - called \"holy land,\" regardless of what they have been expertly programmed to believe and profess, and regardless of the pseudo - scientific evidence offered forth from time to time. Nor are they aware of the Druidic symbolism that permeates the religious iconography erroneously believed to be \"Jewish.\" They are however, obsessed with the idea that they had ancestors who walked with Abraham and who live d under the shadow of the great temple during the time of the Judges and Kings of Jerusalem. The Jewish world teems with scholars, historians, and antiquarians, and those obsessed with proving fantasies such as these. To the Cult of Aton's insidious agents this obsession serves an important purpose. It distracts . And it takes a long, long time to prove. It is good that all eyes are on the Jews and the average Christian and their histories. It is good to have paid evangelists in America (Jerry Faldwell, Pat Robertson, Jack Van Impe, John Hagee, etc) spew nonsense about the holiness of Israel and of the twelve tribes, and so on.

Therefore, we would do well to be extremely critical and skeptical when reading any historical scripture par ticularly those that have been \"authorized\" and that are considered \"holy.\" In truth, official history is nothing more than a concoction, a cunning artifice designed to obscure the true history of the world. After all, what has Christianity told us about t he world we live in? W hat have the learned men of the Christian church offered to their devotees for their enlightenment concerning the mysteries of history and existence? Let us review just a few propositions to see if they be the products of enlightened or ignorant minds: The world was created by god The creation occurred approximately 4,000 years BC The entire creation took six days to bring into being The very first man created was named Adam W oman was created from Adam's rib while he slept Adam lived f or 930 years The human species originated in Africa After 1, 655 years had elapsed, a flood was send by god to eradicate all life on Earth The only survivors of the devastation were Noah and his family. Their ark was filled with two of every species of ani mal All humanity (black or white) descend from the biblical Noah These propositions about the creation and existence of human beings have been ardently advocated and believed for over 2,000 years. Pagan myths and legends were contemptuously ridiculed and d ismissed while learned men and women chose instead to adamantly believe what they read in the Christian bible. Many people in the W estern world still believe these Christian fictions regardless of evidence provided by the sciences of geology and archaeolog y. W e are told that the bible was originally written in Hebrew. But we are less frequently informed as to how many versions of the testaments existed, or of the historical lateness of Hebrew that is not an ancient language. No less than 30,000 various read ings of the Old and New Testaments have been discovered...we must admit that from the circumstances connected with transcribing, some errata may have found their way into it, and that the Sacred Scriptures have, in this case, suffered the same fate as othe r productions of antiquity...In the last 220 years critical learning has so much improved, and so many new manuscripts have come to light, as to call for a revision of the present authorized version - Robert Sears ( History of the Bible, 1849) In the Hebrew manuscripts that have been examined, some 80,000 various readings actually occur as to the Hebrew consonants.

The bible's passages are certainly not to be taken as accurate historical accounts. Additionally, the authors of the passages cannot be considered learned men. Their agenda was not to inform or enlighten, but to befuddle, confu se, and control. W hen we read their accounts concerning the origin of the Israelites and Judites, the slavery in Egypt, the exodus, the roving in the wilderness for forty years, the settlement of Jerusalem, the alleged captivities in Assyria and Babylon, a nd of any other event, we would do well to be skeptical in the extreme and aware that we are not being informed of things that actually happened. W hat we read, although fascinating, is a travesty of history composed by consummate liars and mythmongers whos e status was, and still is, utterly compromised by facts and by the truth. The mythographers of Tanis, Alexandria, and Rome knew that it was very likely that the curious of later generations would ask questions concerning the history of symbolism. The hier archs among the Israelites (Levites) knew that questions would be asked regarding the term \"kingship\" as used by their chiefs, and about their six - pointed star, red hand, lion and unicorn insignia, and about many of the other icons and motifs. Some percept ive observers who had accepted the idea of the legitimacy of the Jewish tribes and their exploits would still wonder why iconography of apparently Semitic origin was incorporated into the heraldry and into the state insignias of Western monarchies and poli tical organizations. Since questions could not be prevented the next best thing would be to provide false answers. And as long as people were falsely allowed to believe that civilization spread from Eastern lands to W estern ones all would be well. Now that the archaeological evidence begins to challenge the lies, new strategies will have to be devised. The authors of biblical texts knew precious little about the immediate past and next to nothing about the distant past. They had neither magic glasses nor an y special knowledge. But they were good poets and skillful story - tellers. Their theology was adventurous and at times courageous, though their philosophy was unexceptional - Thomas L. Thompson ( The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) The bible's authors and editors were not perfect in their work and they left many inconsistencies allowing us to question the authenticity of the many outlandish stories incorporated into the text. One of the ways we can uncover the fraudulence of the auth ors is to look for duplicated motifs and accounts. And there are many such. As Professor Thomas Thompson writes: One of the most striking examples of historical echoing is in the structuring of Matthew‘s story of Jesus on the Mount of Olives the night he i s arrested. (Matt 26: 30 - 46). While Jesus is walking to the Mount of Olives he talks to his friends of their coming"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"betrayal and rejection of him. When they arrive, he asks Peter and John to pray with him, but they fall asleep. He is full of anxiety, aband oned by his friends, and prays that he might avoid his coming fate. Yet, in the end, he submits to the divine will...The story is told in a threefold repetition of this prayer, alternating with the motif of his disciples‘ carefree slumber. When the scene clo ses, Jesus announces that the ̳son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners‘...Our model for Matthew‘s account is found in the story of David in II Samuel 15:13 - 37. In that story, David‘s son Absalom has just been declared king in Hebron, causing civil w ar. The people go over to Absalom and David is isolated and has to flee Jerusalem...David then goes to the Mount of Olives, crying the whole way, and everyone who goes with him bows their head and weeps...David then goes to the Mount of Olives, ̳where it is th e custom to pray to God.‘ - ( The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) The most striking characteristic...of biblical narratives generally, is its tireless repetition. Hardly a story goes by that does not have its parallel, its double, or its variant in one way or another. In the first eleven chapters alone, which in Genesis cover hardly as many pages, we find two creation stories, two stories of the flood and two accounts of how the nations spread over the face of the earth. Without its variants, our biblical narrative would hardly fill half its present size - ibid Akhenaton - the \"Broken King.\" Losing his mighty empir e was no small upset. The humiliation and indignity was undoubtedly felt very poignantly by the Atonist king who could not fathom why he had been so maligned and misunderstood. From his broken throne and dark halls of exile, his confusion turned to hatred for the world and for mankind. All that mattered was revenge If we re - read the two accounts referred to, as well as the rest of the chapters from II Samuel, we will see that the accounts reveal something more interesting than the good professor is aware of. They are not only duplicates, they are commemorations. They are fictive to be sure, since the events outlined did not happen in reality. However, the fictive elements were contrived by an author who knew about the sorro w and lamentation, not of David and Jesus, but of Akhenaton, the exiled pharaoh. It is he who felt himself betrayed by his incompetent followers and he who felt cheated by friends. It is he who felt lost and abandoned. It was Akhenaton who sorely desired h is \"fate\" to be otherwise but who was compelled by fate to submit to divine will. To save going mad from loss and humiliation one may indeed find themselves bitterly praying while the less afflicted doze. W e need to grasp the fact that the editors were alw ays thinking of their past and of ways to commemorate what had happened to them. They wanted to accomplish this without giving away the whole truth. W e also need to know that they were richly imbued with the customs and idioms of the great land they had oc cupied for so long, and that these memories of Egypt and its ways could not be simply excised from their minds and from their behavior.

The latter were loaded stories full of nuance and meanings understandable to the initiated reader. W hen the number 12 appears, for instance, we can be sure that regardless of the permutation and rendition the original trope had to do with the heavens and with astrology. So, whether we read of a patriarch with 12 sons, or a man with 12 brothers, or of a land with 12 divisions, or of a saint with 12 followers, etc, etc, we comprehend that we are reading a rendition, a com posite fable, and not a historical account. A perusal of the chapters and verses of the Old and New Testaments proves most illuminating, in this regard, once we are privy to the real \"story.\" And Moses rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar un der the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel - (Exodus 24) ...The outer darkness is a great serpent, the tail of which is in his mouth, and it is outside the whole world, and surroundeth the whole world: in it there are many pla ces of punishment, and it containeth twelve halls wherein severe punishment is inflicted. In each hall is a governor differing from his neighbor - Egyptian Passage (from E. A. Wallis Budge The Gods of the Egyptians, vol. 1) O, ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times? - (Matt 16:3) In solemn wonder he (Jacob) cried out: ̳How awesome is this shrine! This is nothing else but an abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven! Egregious tampering with ter ms, words, titles, and symbolism, did not occur only to the Egyptian and Irish canon. The phenomenon was employed as a matter of course and affected the symbolic, cosmological, and theological canon of many civilizations, such as the Mycenaean, Minoan, Etr uscan, Phoenician, Hindu, and Mayan. As authors Philip Gardiner and Gary Osborn discovered when researching their book on the Holy Grail, the journey toward the truth of an arcane subject is most definitely compromised by such doctoring. Commenting on thei r chosen subject, they state: Sir Thomas Mallory, author of the fifteenth - century Morte d‘Arthur, was the first to use the words ̳Holy Grail‘ and said that the Sangkreal was the blessed blood of Christ. But in his English Etymology, Walter Skeat (1833 - 1912 ), one of the greatest investigators of the roots of the English language, states that the etymology of the Holy Grail ̳was very early falsified by an intentional change from San Greal (Holy Dish) to Sang Real (Holy Blood)...We found that such misinterpretat ions, or deliberate falsifications, have appeared ever since the Grail‘s ancient origins - Philip Gardiner and Gary Osborn ( The Serpent Grail )"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"One blatant example of the plagiarization of pagan culture concerns the monogram that is attributed by Christians to Jesus - the figure IHS . These are the first letters of the Latin term Jesu Hominum Salvator (\"Jesus the Savior of Men\"). But it has also been used as the cryptogram for In Hoc Signo (in this sign), and for other such mottos. Its original usage concerne d Bacchus (Dionysus), who was often depicted as a radiant and handsome effeminate male with a crown of sun rays (thorns). The monogram was simply taken and re - scripted. It is but one example out of thousands. The Cult of Aton were segregationist and relish ed the fact that their leader was a man apart. This aura of difference carried over to their Levite followers who would later falsely appear distinguished by their monotheism. However, here again we have truth falsely rendered. The so - called Israelites wer e not monotheistic but henotheistic . They had merely selected one god from many to worship. They had one king over them, Akhenaton, and they had his god. But their inclination was syncretistic. As we learn from the accounts of the Jewish historian Philo, t he early Israelites were pantheistic. They even revered the feminine Sophia the goddess of wisdom and they saw her as an ambassador of god, the capacity within men to reason and to intelligently contemplate the mysteries of god. Naturally, as the church be came more established it saw itself as taking over the role of Sophia. It would dictate what man would know and believe about god's will and what it delivered forth would be accepted on faith, and neither doubted nor critiqued. The propagandists expertly c ultivated an image for themselves, and that image is monotheism. We are accustomed to look upon the Jewish religion as strictly monotheistic. In truth, it never was, even in the Mosaic times, until after the return from Exile. And this is clear, in spite of the trouble which the composers of the so - called historic books of the Old Testament have taken to work up the traditions in a monotheistic sense and to obliterate the traces of the early Jewish polytheism, by transforming the ancient gods into patriar chs, heroes, angels and servants of Jahwe - Arthur Dewes ( The Christ Myth ) It has been claimed by some that Amenhetep IV was the first monotheist in Egypt, but the acceptance of this statement depends upon what meaning is given to the word monotheism, i.e. , the doctrine of there being only one god. The passages from the Moral Papyri...show that the Egyptian priests and learned men were monotheistic, even though they do not proclaim the oneness of the god to whom they refer. The idea of oneness was well unde rstood under the Ancient Empire, but in the Pyramid Texts the attribute is ascribed to the \"gods\" and to kings as well as to God. Thus in Teta (l. 237) the \"lord one\" is mentioned; in Merenra I the king is called \"great god alone,\" (l. 127), and is said to be stronger than every god; and in Pepi II (l. 952) the king is called the \"one of heaven,\" Now the monotheism of Amenhetep IV was different from that of the writers of the Moral Papyri, and the oneness of Aten which he proclaimed resembled the oneness of several other Egyptian solar gods and also gods to whom solar attributes had not been originally ascribed. Tem, Horus of the Two Horizons, and Ra, each of these is called \"One,\" and \"only one,\" whether mentioned singly or together as a triad, and the same title was given to Amen after his fusion with Ra.

Thompson ( The Mythic Past: Biblical Arch aeology and the Myth of Israel ) The egregious artifice of the mythmongers has continued unabated down through the ages, from royally appointed scribes in Alexandria, Judea, Rome, London, and other cities. The tools of the scribe were the simplest for they were mere words . One does not plant or reap them. They do not cost anything to produce and yet there is an endless supply. They can mean anything to anyone and can even be indestructible. W hen the author of the Book of Genesis wrote his first line \"In the beginning was the word,\" he smiled at the joke he was playing. Only he would know what he meant and only he would know that he was right. In the \"beginning\" was indeed \"the word \" - his word right there on the parchment in front of him - Creatio ex Nihilo . In a world of illiterates the word was magical. The scribe was the magician. He was the conjuror who could fashion stories, fables, and tales, and who could manipulate legends and myths to suit whatever ideology his masters wished to insinuate and propagat e. He could write about the past and his interpretations, or those of his patrons, would be taken for facts. How could it be otherwise? His readers were not there , back then, to know one way or another. And so the past became whatever the historian said it was. It was not the past itself, of course, but a carefully crafted fiction that stood in place of the past and that the scribe brought to life. And these words, these dark flame - like gifts of Mercury, were the magical agents that could convey to the illi terate the ways of the invisible god they worshipped. By word and letter, by poem and hymn, the wordsmith could edify, influence, and control the multitude. He could teach, thrill, and inspire and could, if he chose, also ridicule, deceive, and confound. H is words could be wings to uplift or nets to entrap. The wordsmith‟s patrons believed in his power when they saw the results of his artifice, and he obeyed their commands in order to exalt himself by way of his unique talent. He had power given him and he had control over the minds of men. He also had power over their emotions and actions. He could rouse thinking men to action and active men to meditation on the meaning of their lives.

He could exalt a pauper to priesthood and make a clerk a general. All men could become all things while under the spel l of the wordsmith. The scribe saw his skill for riddles, rhymes, and rubrics win him the favor of princes and popes. No man had more potential power than the man who could write. The world was his oyster to be opened not with sword but with word. He was t he son of Mercury and the doors of Olympus were ever open to him, as were those of Hades.

They have literally created fictive peoples and races to pose in their place with no provable historical connection to Egypt. W hen limelight falls across those with no l egitimate connection to the ancient thrones of the world it is not upon those frequenters of the shadows who do have that connection.

The world teems with duplicitous scholars, \"historians,\" and Zionist (Atonist) spin doctors secretly commissioned to perpetuate this fabulous disinformation.

Thompson ( The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) It might be asked why the Levites and the Cult of Aton, after their exil e and ruthless occupation of Judea, chose to downplay all connection to Egypt and alter their titles and personal names. W hy did they refer to themselves as \"Levites,\" \"Israelites,\" and \"Judites,\" etc, when they were as we have shown, eighteenth dynasty ph araohs recently departed from Egypt? And we might ask why they would not wish to emphasize that their patriarchs (Abraham, Jacob, and others) were linked to the Hyksos kings who dominated Lower Egypt for over 300 years. One would think that they could not resist this flaunting of their reputation and status. Authors Messod and Roger Sabbah offer a few semi -"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"plausible reasons for the duplicity and obscuration of the biblical authors. According to their understanding, the Babylonians were dire enemies of the E gyptians and so, during their captivity in Babylon, the Israelites and Judites thought it best to downplay the fact that Akhenaton, Aye, and the other leading Atonists, were their masters. This is the reason, say the authors, that the story of Abraham bein g from Ur in Mesopotamia rather than from Egypt was concocted. Their concocted history was, all in all, a ruse to make their treatment in Babylon more pleasant. W e, however, take a different point of view. Firstly, we have doubts about the two captivity st ories, and doubts about the formation of any colony at the place known as Israel. Our main reason for this doubt concerns the destiny of the earlier exiles, those Hyksos who were expelled en masse by Ahmose I. W here did these people go? Surely, these fabul ously wealthy and powerful ex - pharaohs of Egypt were not doomed to be wanderers in the wilderness for forty years. After their departure would not these Hyksos have swiftly and intelligently ingratiated themselves with their allies in Nubia, Minoan Crete, Sardinia (Shardana), Greece, Italy, Persia, Babylon, and possibly even among the Phoenicians? W e think it most likely that the Hyksos of old, of the first Egyptian exodus, did find new homes in the lands around Egypt and possibly within its borders, in cit ies of the Eastern Delta such as Tanis. Therefore, would they not have welcomed and protected the Judites, their blood - kin, who had been themselves ousted from hated Egypt? W e think this was definitely the case. W e do not think the Judites experienced a si ngle day of hardship after their unceremonious departure. W e understand, however, that they did not wish to have their royal Egyptian connections emphasized. W e understand that their choice of names was based on this need for concealment. For them Egypt wa s taboo and references to their role in its history would be drastically distorted and underplayed. The terms adopted as monikers, such as \"Levite,\" \"Israelite,\" \"Hebrew,\" and \"Judite,\" etc, were terms that primarily connoted their theological status and d uties. These were common terms for priests, particularly of the Stellar, Saturnian, and Solar Cults. They did not signify ethnicity. In fact, as we strongly advocate, these terms originally derived from Ireland and from the Druids. The fact that Egyptian a nd Druidic iconography permeated Judeo - Christianity was just an anomaly that would have to be covered up and downplayed through time. This was agreed by all. This ploy has been deliberate and has, for the most part, succeeded. The iconography exists and ha s always puzzled scholars and researchers who cannot account for it unless they accept the official story of the captivity of the Jews in Egypt, a fiction from start to finish. For instance, the term \"King \" (as in \"King Solomon,\" etc) could not have come t o be used by the \"Israelites\" unless there was a strong Egyptian influence.

It was not the Jews who originated such concepts. And these are only two of many hundreds of examples.

And the son of Jonathan was Merib - baal\" (1 Chron. viii, 33, 34). David named his last son, save one, B eeliada, \"Baal Knows\" (1 Chron. xiv, 7). Solomon's worship included not merely the worship of Jehovah, but that of Baal and other gods...Most of the Israelites certainly saw no harm in these ornaments, since they were not aware of any very great difference between the character of Yahweh (Jehovah) and that of Baal, Astarte, or Moloch. Long after the time of Solomon the horses and chariots of the Sun were kept in the temple (2 Kings xxiii, 11). Many of the stories concerning Moses, Joshua, Jonah, and other B ible characters are solar myths. Samson was a sun god. Dr. Oort says: \"Sun - worship was by no means unknown to the Israelites...The myths that were circulated among these people show that they were zealous worshipers of the sun. These myths are still preser ved, but, as in all other cases, they are so much altered as to be hardly recognizable. The writer who has preserved them for us lived at a time when the worship of the sun had long ago died out. He transforms the sun god into an Israelite hero Samson\" - J ohn E.

They woul d have had to admit that they were renegades and that they were forcibly expelled by consensus and public uprising against them. And they would have to admit, should the facts ever come out, that their \"Moses\" - the real life Akhenaton - had an incestuous relationship with his megalomaniacal, foreign - blooded mother Queen Tiye. Additionally, they would have to admit to the world that their great savior or Messiah, Joshua (Tutankhamun), was the son, not of god, but of an incestuous relationship between his ow n father and his grandmother. None of this, as we can see, is in the least bit aggrandizing. Secondly, they would have to explain why they have been seeking the limelight of history as god's \"chosen\" ones. They would need to explain how they could have bee n condemning every other culture and nation and every other theology as if they were uniquely spiritually endowed when, in fact, they were originally a bunch of treacherous, bloodthirsty, pantheists benefiting from their sojourn in a land of enlightened ad epts. Yes, such admissions would certainly tarnish their image. So, it was decided that the truth concerning their origins and history would be obscured and that great efforts would be made to degrade and berate Egypt and its people. The burden of Egypt. B ehold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall meet in the midst of it. And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor...And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof - (Isaiah 19:1) He shall deliver their kings into thine hand and thou shalt destroy their name from them...Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess, served their gods - ( The Torah ) Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wick edness afflict them, as beforetime - (II Samuel 7:10) These frivolous and utterly senseless specimens of humanity, accustomed from the first to erroneous ideas about the gods, were incapable of imitating the solemnity of our theology, and the sight of our numerous admirers filled them with envy - Josephus Piso (Jewish - Roman historian, denigrating the Egyptians) When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it then proclaim peace unto it.

They were legends in their own minds and wanted to be acknowledged as spiritual progenitors and as a specially endowed priestarchy directly marked and chosen by god himself. And so the cult of Judaism as we now know it was born. This is why we have to be uncommonly skeptical about every account and passage of Judaic and Christian history that comes to us from the time of the exodus, from the time of the founding of the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities, and from the Grecian and Roman periods. W e can take it as a given that these accounts are infested with lies and that the testaments have been composed at the behest of the descendants of this perfidiou s Solar Cult of Akhenaton. Although the narrative concerns what are purported to be monumental historical events, the Bible gives us no idea when they were supposed to have occurred: it provides no dates and fails to name the pharaohs in question. Despite the mass of contemporary records that survive from ancient Egypt, not one historical reference to the presence of the Israelites in that country has yet been found. Not a word about Joseph, whom the Bible tells us was a pharaoh's \"grand vizier\" - his chief minister. Not a single mention of Moses, whom the Bible tells us was raised as an Egyptian prince. Nothing concerning the plagues, which included the day turning to night and the Nile turning to blood. And nothing regarding the spectacular flight from Egy pt by a people which, we are told, number over half a million. In fact, there is no ancient evidence independent of the Bible - from anywhere - which definitely corroborates any of these events - Graham Philips ( Act of God ) Perhaps now, we can comprehend t he vehement tyrannical zeal of emperors Constantine, Theodosius, Justinian, and Charlemagne, and the guile of the church fathers and early bishops. They wished to ensure that an authorized book with officially vetted \"histories\" was created and released to the world. By the time of the early compilation attempts the real story was out and about in the world, but the demagogues believed themselves quite able to crush those sects and cults (Jewish, Gentile, Egyptian, and Pagan) that had preserved fragments of the truth. After all, these potentates considered themselves descended from the Hyksos kings who once enjoyed total dominion over people and who, as sons of Aton, expected total obedience from their minions. Their harsh, intolerant, and oppressive rule du ring the Christian era was nothing new but was true to form. In fact, it was all the more harsh since they wished to forego the fate of their fore - fathers and not have their rule questioned or their thrones taken away again.

The Ptolemies and their queens were all styled gods. The Saviour - gods were succeeded on the throne by the Brother - gods , the Beneficent - gods, the Father - loving gods, the Illustrious - gods, and others. Such were the titles given to the several Ptolemies. This custom was copied by some of the Greek kings of Syria, and in part continued under the Roman emperors, though Augustu s, on his Alexandrian coins, only claims the lower rank of being a Son of God - Samuel Sharpe ( Egyptian Mythology and Egyptian Christianity ) The Emperor Constantine...went on to issue the Edict of Milan, in 313 AD, which legalized Christianity throughout t he Empire. Shortly thereafter, it became the fastest spreading religion. Constantine‘s conversion to Christianity is still shrouded in mystery - Arthur Kemp ( March of the Titans ) This is also the reason why modern Egyptologists, historians, and biblical sc holars, dribble and splutter sycophantically over this Akhenaton. They know the facts and are under the auspices of the cult whose power over the world has increased since ancient times.

Will the Real Jews Please Stand Up Let us pose a hypothetical question: Were the Hebrews who left Ur with Abraham in 2000 BC, and the Hebrews who entered Egypt under Joseph in 1600 BC, the same people as the Israelites who were led out of Egypt by Moses in 1200 BC? Were these Israelites who came out of Egypt the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or were they a different people?...In Genesis, the book dealing with their h istory before their entry into Egypt, the Jews are, with one exception, referred to as Hebrews, not as Israelites. After their exodus from Egypt and in the other Books of Moses, the Jews are referred to mostly as Israelites, very seldom as Hebrews. After t he exodus, it is the pagans who usually refer to the Jews as Hebrews, whereas the Jews usually refer to themselves as Israelites - Max Dimont ( Jews, God and History ) The names of the patriarchal heroes, as that of God Himself, are non - Semitic...and go back to the earliest known civilizations in the near East, indeed of the world - John Allegro ( The Chosen People ) Contrary to the disinformation disseminated from official historical sources, the Jews and their Torah did not rise to prominence for the first ti me in Alexandria during the Ptolemaic dynasty (305 - 30 BC). They had been deeply entrenched in the cities of the W estern Delta since the 13th dynasty and were involved with the solar churches of Heliopolis, Avaris, Amarna, and Tanis. As Levites, they were f ollowers of Akhenaton, the biblical Moses. The role the \"Jews\" played in Egypt during pre - Hellenistic ages has only recently come to light. The new discoveries shatter most of the fallacies concerning the Jews and their status. A very few scholars of the p ast have, however, hinted at the antiquity of the connection between elite Levites and the Egyptian priests. But, in more modern times, we become acquainted with a body of Jews who had been for centuries living in Egypt, and were no longer confined to th eir own towns, on the eastern branch of the Nile. They had learned the use of the Greek language, and were thence called Hellenists; and among them we find many philosophical and even religious opinions, which owe their origin to the Egyptian priests among whom they were living - Samuel Sharpe ( Egyptian Mythology and Egyptian Christianity , 1863) The opinions of the Egyptians show themselves equally clearly in two of the Apocryphal books of the Bible, which were written by Jews living in Lower Egypt, perhaps in Alexandria; namely, The Wisdom of the Son of Sirach, and The Wisdom of Solomon - ibid Let us ever bear in mind from now on that the generic terms \"Israelite\" and \"Hebrew\" denote those people who had spent time in Egypt and who were most probably of Hyk sos origin. A huge contingent of these people had been"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"ousted during the reign of Ahmose I, sometime after 1580 BC. They settled in the city of Tanis and in countries beyond the borders of Egypt, where they prospered. Therefore, the group that exited with Akhenaton had friends and supporters waiting with open arms. A few are thought to have remained in Egypt after pledging to adhere to the new laws laid down by the new pharaoh and his state officers. It is likely that these few were allowed to keep their il lustrious positions as governors, priests, advisors, and politicians, etc. It is likely that from the 13th dynasty onward the sun colleges and temples of the lower Nile (the Delta), such as those at Avaris, Amarna, Giza, and Heliopolis, were under Hyksos c ontrol. It is from these temples that the term and title \"Israelite\" (as it has come to be used) derives. Since the earliest and greatest solar deity was the Irish Iesa, and since his worship had been brought to Egypt from the W est by the Shemsu Hor (the D isciples of Horus), his adepts simply adopted titles based on his holy name. The names of many later solar personalities, such as Dionysus (Dion - esus ), and Orpheus (Orph - esus ) and Bacchus (Bacch - esus ), Zeus, and Jesus (J - esus ), etc, were just such renditio ns based on the prototype. W hen the testaments were conceived it was decided that both the word and concept of Israel should be personified . For reasons not explained Jacob - the son of Isaac (Isa, Esa) and grandson of Abraham was renamed Israel by god. Th is act of \"renaming\" (Genesis 35:9) was one of several clever ploys by the bible's mythographers to distort history and obscure the identity and existence of the Cult of Aton. The so - called Jewish \"Tribe of Manasseh\" is, as a perusal of the symbolism revea ls, yet another cover term and idea for the Atonists. Suggestively, the word Manasseh contains the syllable and phoneme assa (or essa ), betraying its Irish origins. There is precious little to support the existence of this or any other \"Israelite\" tribe. T he fiction of the ten tribes is a convenient dramatic device behind which the devilish Solar Cult remains hidden. So, let it be known that when we read the terms Jew, Judaism, Israel, Israelite, Hebrew , and Chosen , etc, we are to think Egypt, Hyksos, Levit e, and Cult of Aton . Bearing this in mind will make our understanding of scripture a great deal easier. The Levites were always considered a tribe apart. Their duties were mostly militaristic and administrative, but they had particular jurisdiction over te mple sacrifices. These duties seem akin to the character of Akhenaten who fancied himself a great military leader."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"The term Juda means the \"shining\" or \"illustrious ones.\" It refers to the members of the Gaonim, or the Cult of Aton, and not to some black - r obe - wearing priestarchy. It refers to the eighteenth dynasty Sun Cult pharaohs of Egypt whose descendants hide under the names \"Israelite\" and \"Judite.\" So when we hear that “David” and “Solomon” (whom we now know as Tuthmosis III and Amenhotep III) were o f the \"House of Judah\" we understand that it was a reference not to the Semites, or the Levites and their ethnicity and theology, but to Egypt's Solar Cult and their theology. The word originally meant the same thing as the word Judge does today. It did no t refer to a particular race but to an elect of educators or adepts initiated into the mysteries and dignified in science and magic. The words Jew , Judite , and Judge are to be rightly regarded as the titles of those proficient in astronomy, astrology, and esoteric science. Change the \"J\" to the phonetically similar \"D\" and we get Dews , or Deus , meaning \"god,\" or \"of god.\" It is important to remember that the writings known to Christians as \"the Old Testament\" were not Jewish but Hebrew. The term \"Jew\" was f irst introduced in 1775 and did not exist prior to that time. The religion we refer to as Judaism had no name until after that period - Alexander S.

Once we realize that neither Christians nor Jews can prove any such descent, the puzzle s are solved. Modern Jews are, like modern Christians, converted to their religions. Individuals who have converted may be able to trace their personal lineage quite far back in time (perhaps to the 17th or 13th centuries), but this kind of biological and racial descent has little bearing on the claims made by Jews and Christians concerning their relationship with the spurious characters of the Old Testament. Jews and Christians have no racial or biological connection to ancient tribes of the so - called \"hol y land.\" There is hardly a Jewish person who can trace his heritage further back than the 16th and 17th centuries and even that is some doing. Over eighty percent of Jews are known as \"Ashkenaz\" Jews. These Jews were resident primarily in Poland and Russia and are racially descended from the inhabitants of the Black and Caspian Sea regions. They were originally the Khazarian people who converted en masse to Judaism in the 7th century. These Turko - Mongolic people have no racial or ethnic connection to the an cient lands of Egypt of Palestine. In our opinion, author Arthur Koestler lost his life because he exposed these facts in his masterpiece of historical revision, The Thirteenth Tribe. Sadly, although innumerable fine books have been written on this fascina ting subject, by Jews and Gentiles alike, few Jews or Gentiles accept the truth about their religion's origins. Their obsession with racial matters has compromised them since race was not important to ancient people. It meant nothing to those who had dedic ated their lives to god and religion. Today, the mainstream institutions, from kindergarten onward to the top university levels, avoid dealing with racial subject matter, while those scholars who look into the tangled history of Judaism usually come away b ewildered. W hen the subject of Judaism is broached we are taught patent falsehoods by those with much to lose should the truth be learned. Few writers have summarized the problem as well as Daniel Pasmanik. He wrote: For the whole history of the Jewish peo ple is unique and without exception in the world. Even today it is an insoluble enigma for sociologists, philosophers and statesmen. Every culture is original and individual, but Jewish culture, the product of Jewish history, is absolutely exceptional - ( Q u'est - ce que le Judaisme ) In short, the bizarre fact is that in almost every case no \"Jew\" living today can trace their family's ancestry back to the time of the Israelites or Judites, let"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"alone back to ancient Egypt.

Obliged to give an official answer...neither Hitler nor the Vichy Government, nor even the Israeli Government have succeeded in elaborating a clear and satisfactory definition. By the Law of Return, the fundamental law of the new Jewish State, promulgated at Tel - Aviv in 1948, Israel gave the freedom of the country to all Jews of the Diaspora, whatever their origin. Once this had been done, the government had to work out a legal definition as to who was and who was not a Jew. Unable to find a legal formula which took into account the three factors of race, religion and nationality, the government of Tel - Aviv was obliged to have recourse to the religious cr iterion. A Jew is someone who belongs to a Jewish community of religion or religious traditions and who is not converted to another religion - Vicomte Leon de Poncins ( Judaism and the Vatican ) From Israel itself Judaism would never have sprung...the real J ew only developed in the course of centuries by gradual physical separation from the rest of the Israelite family...he is not the result of a normal national life, but, so to speak, an artificial product - the product of a priestly caste which, with the he lp of alien priests, forced upon the people against its will a priestly legislation and a priestly faith as having been given by God - Houston Stewart Chamberlain ( Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, 1899) Furthermore, in fourteenth century Spain, were not Jews forced to convert to Christianity? The converted were referred to as \"Marrano.\" This word meant \"accursed\" or \"damned.\" How would such a edict exist if it were known that being a Jew is a racial or ethnic distinction? It was enforced by Christian tyrants to re - covert converts who had preferred Judaism as a religion over Christianity, a choice that was unacceptable to the monarchs of medieval Spain. Our point is that it was a choice to be either Jewish or Christian. Judaism is in the brain not the b lood. The modern Jew simply adopts his religion as a man of any race might do, and as many men do.

W e need to be particularly skeptical when reading passages dealing with the famous city of Jerusalem and Temple of Solomon. The ear liest part of this period in the hill country has been traditionally presented as the \"Golden Age\" of ancient Egypt with its capital in Jerusalem. The era has been associated with the \"United Monarchy\" wielding the political power of a Saul, a David and a Solomon and controlling a land - bridge from the Nile to the Euphrates, as well as with the concept of a temple built by Solomon as the center of worship of Yahweh. These images have no place in descriptions of the real historical past.

There is no evidence of a United Monarchy, no evidence of a capital at Jerusalem or of any coherent, unified political for ce that dominated western Palestine, let alone any empire of the size the legends describe.

This fact is not, however, known to the general rank and file, and many of the latest whistle - blowing experts, such as Thomas L. Thompson, have suffered suppression and academic exile. While it is a hard - won principle of biblical archaeology that the historicity of ancient biblical narratives about old Israel cannot be confirmed unless we have extra - biblical evidence, it is just as important to be aware that even when we do have such extra - biblical confirmation, it is more likely to confirm the Bible‘s literary and metaphorical tropes than to establish it as historical record - Thomas L.

Professor Thompson goes on to level the facts at us, facts that loom like mountains over valleys of lies. His discoveries, and those of his fellow archaeologists, resu rrect the theories of Comyns Beaumont who, among others, was condemned outright for his claims that the events in the bible's Old Testament did not occur at the locations specified. For all the writings on the great and holy city of Jerusalem, home to the tribes of Israel and to the temple of Solomon, we have not a single piece of evidence to geographically place it. A priest or rabbi can talk endlessly about the auspicious events that took place in the holy city, and can edify their congregations with dram atic descriptions of it. But there is not one of them who could take any of those members to the place. The spot that bears the name Jerusalem today is not the original . That place has not been located. Jerusalem‘s history...remains impossible to write. Alt hough the Egyptian Amarna letters, which give us correspondence between Palestine‘s petty princes and kings and the Egyptian Pharaoh of the late fourteenth and early thirteenth centuries, tell us much of about the town of Urusalim and about its patron and king, Abdi - Hepa, we know nothing about this town from archaeology. We are not even certain where it was located, though we have every reason to believe that it was at Jerusalem.

Although the name Judea is a geographical term occurring in Assyrian period texts, referring to the highlands south of Jerusalem, in the Persi an period the name is political. It is the name of the Persian province. The Assyrians‘ name for the southern highlands, Jaudaa, and the Persians‘ imperial name, Yehud, were no more reflective of a people than were any of the other names for regions of the empire. Moreover, the geographical spread of people referred to as Yehudim is so great that it would be rash to assume that this name refers to their place of origin. Nor should we continue to understand this term as ethnographic, without evidence - Thoma s L. Thompson ( The Mythic Past, Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) Biblical scholar and ranking archaeologist, Professor Thomas L. Thompson, long wondered how it could be that a nation of Israel would have spontaneously and rapidly risen to power and historical eminence in a region devastated by almost a millennia of drought. There have been many periods of severe drought in Eastern Europe and Asia that have decimated countries and displaced masses of people, and yet we are told to believe that th e Nation of Israel rose to power when its neighbors were so grievously dispossessed by nature's relentless wrath. The idea is preposterous. The destruction of Troy, the end of Mycenaean culture, the fall of the empires of the Hittites in Turkey, the Amurru in Syria, the Minoans of Crete, and the invasion of Egypt, are just a few of the catastrophic events known to have befallen Europe and Asia Minor during this particular interval. Two other natural upheavals of importance that specifically affected Britai n and Scandinavia were the great Storegga Tsunami (6100 BC) and the Bronze Age famine (1159 BC). The former disaster drastically altered the topography of Norway and Britain‟s The so - called \"Stone of Bethel\" refers to the Druidic stone that stands in front of the door of the House of God/Sun (Hebrew - Beth ).

This fluctuation of sea level contributed to the loss of the land bridge that once existed between England and the Continent. It drowned coastline complete with dwellings. The effects of the latter incident were felt throughout Ireland where the population was forced to endure over eighteen years of failed harvests. Prolonged disasters such as these led to widespread mortality and to considerable population displacement through forced evacuation and subsequent migration. Research since the 1970s suggests that there were three global super - floods: 15,000 to 14,000 years ago; 12,000 to 11,000 years ago; and 8,000 to 7,000 years ago. The second period ties in with the date Plato ascribed in the Timaeus and Critias to the destruction by earthquakes an d flooding of Atlantis, and with the Tamil myth of the submerging of the fabled land of Kumari Kandam. There is also strong evidence that nearly half the total meltwater released at the end of the last Ice Age was concentrated into these three relatively s hort periods. Such events would have had a momentous impact on the human inhabitants at that time, leaving a marked impression on oral tradition, the original transmitter of all ancient myths - Harry Young ( Bridging the Myth and Science of the Flood ) Furth er East, there was the havoc caused by the so - called “Mycenaean Drought.” This extended period of drought had severe consequences for the economies of the Aegean civilizations. Some nations did not survive. During the height of the drought Egypt was repeat edly attacked by armed marauders and gangs from disaffected lands. Illegal immigration was rampant and wars ensued both upon land and sea. Many enemies were repelled but a large contingent succeeded seizing some territory. Over time many of these sundry tr ibes and peoples became absorbed amongst the Egyptians and Palestinians. They were known in Egypt by a variety of interchangeable terms, such as Amu, Shutu, Hurru, and Medaw, depending upon whether they came from deserts, highland areas, or from more dista nt parts. These terms reflected their character but do not seem to be accurate as to racial origins. Across the world, Bronze Age civilizations faced similar disaster...Egypt was almost overrun by an invasion of sea peoples, nations were on the move, and in distant China terrible events heralded the fall of the mighty Shang Dynasty. All these events took place in the mid - twelfth century BC...It has been suggested that disaster may have been caused by massive volcanic eruptions throwing up so much dust into the atmosphere that the sun was dimmed for almost two decades - Carmel McCaffrey and Leo Eaton ( In Search of Ancient Ireland ) The cataclysmic eruption of the volcano Thera on the Mediterranean island of Santorini was another event that radically challenges con ventional notions about the Israelites and their early history. Thera violently erupted during the reign of Ahmose I (1575 - 1550 BC). Researchers believe the incident to have"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"had appalling consequences for life in Eastern Europe and Asia. The volcano‟s afte r effects (tidal waves, obscuration of sunlight, ash - choked atmosphere, climatic anomalies, and weather fluctuations, etc) would have persisted for decades. Many major civilizations are known to have been utterly wrecked by the event and so, again, it seem s highly unlikely that one small and relatively fragile group could merrily continue on socially, agriculturally, and economically, without ill effects. During such times of disaster Egypt that, according to the bible (and the recently discovered Tempest S tele from which the biblical accounts were taken), suffered great devastation, was forced to act as the savior of the world and attempted to feed and house hundreds of thousands of refugees. Despite the damaged it sustained, Egypt was the only civilization to remain relatively intact during the period of upheaval. The volcanic eruption was enormous in its proportions and the after effects of such an explosion would have lasted for decades if not centuries. Expert on the Hyksos Dynasty, author Ralph Ellis, b elieves that the first exodus took place during this time. But, as we have already pointed out, he stresses that the Israelites who fled an upset and weakened Egypt were not the ragged enslaved bunch mentioned in the Old Testament. On the contrary, they we re a powerful and wealthy coterie who looted and pillaged Egypt, destroying temples and shrines and burning down pyramids as they departed. Despite this new found evidence, we are expected to believe that the bible's \"chosen people\" flourished to establish their own cities during an era when overland trade, shipping, farming, cultivation, husbandry, and every other facet of civic life was practically eradicated, and when the greatest civilizations were reeling in shock. The sane man knows he cannot argue wi th archaeological evidence. He also knows that such information can easily be suppressed so that an age - old deception can persist indefinitely. In 1999, Professor Thompson wrote: One cannot speak historically of a state without a population. Nor can one sp eak of a capital without a town. Stories are not enough...The immediate origins of this population rested in the settlement of the displaced part of the population that had abandoned the lowlands in the wake of the Mycenaean drought - ibid The Bible knows nothing or nearly nothing of most of the great, transforming events of Palestine's history. Of historical causes it knows only one: Palestine's ancient deity Yahweh. It knows nearly nothing of the great droughts that changed the course of Palestine's world for centuries, and it is equally ignorant of the region's great historical battles at Megiddo, Kadesh, and Lachish. The Bible tells us nothing directly of four hundred years of Egyptian presence. Nor can it take on any role of teaching us anything about t he wasteful competition for the Jezreel in the early Iron Age, or about the forced sedentarization of nomads along Palestine's southern flank - ibid Those experts who know the facts about the region, and about the economic and cultural climate, know that n o such nation could have formed in an"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"\"illiterate backwater,\" practically overnight, regardless of what the \"great\" historians of the past have said in their spurious writings and accounts. ...we still have no hard archaeological evidence - despite the unp aralleled biblical description of its grandeur - that Jerusalem was anything more than a modest highland village in the time of David, Solomon, and Rehoboam - Neil Asher Silberman and Israel Finkelstein ( The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Anc ient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts ) For anyone trying to make a living from the soil, the hills of Canaan posed an intimidating challenge. The climate was hostile. In summer the country was scorched by the sun and the hot, sand - laden sirocco wi nd.

Then, as the sun grew in strength, the gentler rains of March and April provided little fresh pasture for sheep, goats and ca ttle before the onset of another dry season - Ahmed Osman ( Christianity: An Egyptian Religion ) One of the most striking and wonderful things about an \"historian\" like Josephus is that he knows almost nothing about \"the past\" that we ourselves do not alread y know from other sources. When an account he gives of a supposed event of two centuries earlier \"confirms\" something we can read in other works, it is only because he has copied or paraphrased it. Josephus has been well described as a person one wouldn't buy a used car from - Thomas L. Thompson ( The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) They did not hesitate to change their sources and reconstruct the past whenever there were gaps in their knowledge, or indeed in any manner that they sa w fit. As we have grown more aware of such typical characteristics...the history of Israel has grown less and less acceptable...Historical scholarship's indolent habit of offering paraphrases of ancient historians and correcting them only when evidence pro ves them wrong will no longer do - ibid That is right - it will no longer do. Nor will it do to continue imagining that such frauds are merely the result of little knowledge and benign academic incompetence. Sure, those employed within the academies and co lleges had better watch their tongues. Clearly, the great historians Max Muller, Robert Graves, and James Frazer, and others, knew more than they ever wrote down, and lesser beings have taken their hint in order to preserve professional reputations. Nevert heless, the time has come for the presentation of the unalloyed truth, from informed tongues unafraid to speak without vested interest or partisan bias. The great biblical archaeologists and historians who can separate fact from fiction, and history from f able, know full well that no such place as Jerusalem, as the bible portrays it, ever existed and that no such \"Nation of Israel\" could have existed. That is right - no Saul, no David, no Solomon, no Temple, and no Israel; no Abraham, no Joseph, no enslavem ent in Egypt and no chosen holy people of god.

The Donation of Constantine About a generation after the Papacy had divorced itself from the empire, a certain papal official, Christophorous by name, completed a task of forgery which neatly transferred the temporal crown from the emperor to the pope - E. R. Chamberlin ( Bad Popes ) In his excellent work on the rise to power of the Vatican, the controversial writer Avro Manhattan details the fraudulence of the early popes and bishops. He writes of their manipulation of kings and of the desire to ex pand territories. Through the patronization of W estern royals the Church of Rome appropriated colossal wealth. Their city's patron saint - Peter (the \"Rock\") - was put forth as man's \"Turnkey\" to heaven. It was he, Peter, who had established Rome and who h ad appointed the popes to officiate in his name. They were the mouthpiece for Peter, as Peter had been mouthpiece for Christ. Avro Manhattan draws our attention specifically to the forgery known as the \"Donation of Constantine,\" the document, that once it was added to the Church's despicable \"Canon Law,\" ratified and secured the reputation and status, both terrestrially and spiritually, of the Roman Church. No monarch ruling today and no government under the monarch or instituted in their name would enjoy t heir position if the Church, empowered by the Donation of Constantine, had not given them permission to rule in the first place...the Donation of Constantine is a complete and utter fraud. The Church was never given any temporal powers at all, let alone the right to found dynasties, crown kings or instituted governments. The Donation of Constantine was a lie from beginning to end and has been known to be a fake since Lorenzo Valla applied the methods of historical criticism during the Renaissance - Prince Nic holas de Vere von Drakenberg ( The Thousand - Year Elven Holocaust ) The Donation of Constantine...is a forged Roman imperial edict devised probably between 750 and 850. Its precise purpose is not entirely certain, but it was clearly a defense of papal interests , perhaps against the claims of either the Byzantine Empire, or the Frankish king Charlemagne, who had assumed the former imperial dignity in the West and with it the title \"Emperor of the Romans\"...the Donation grants Pope Sylvester I and his successors, as inheritors of St Peter, the dominion over the city of Rome, Italy, and the entire Western Roman Empire, while Constantine would retain imperial authority in the Eastern Roman Empire from his new imperial capital of Constantinople...This document was used by medieval popes to bolster their claims for territorial and secular power in Italy. It was widely accepted, though the Emperor Otto III denounced the document as a forgery - (Online Encyclopedia Wikipedia.org ) Not content with the Papal States and the ne w regions acquired, the popes now wanted even more...They set themselves to expand even further their ownership of additional territories.

At this point this most spectacular of all forgeries makes its official appearance: the Donation of Constantine. Purporting to have been written by the Emperor Constantine himself, it emerged from nowhere. The document with one master stroke put th e popes above kings, emperors and nations, made them legal heirs to the territory of the Roman Empire, which it granted to them lock, stock and barrel, and gave to St. Peter...all lands to the West and beyond, indeed, all the lands of the planet - Avro Man hattan ( Vatican Billions ) The Emperor Constantine lived between 208 to 337 AD.

Constantine‘s conversion to Christianity is still shrouded in mystery and led to the most famous forgery in European history, that which became known as the Donation of Constantine. This document purports to be a signed document by Constantine and its principal feature is to grant the bishop of Rome - the Pope - temporal authority over the city of Rome and the entire Roman Empire. Although there are many glaring factual errors in the text of the document, which by themselves show the document to be a fo rgery, the Donation of Constantine was accepted as genuine until the 15th Century, and was used by the Catholic Church to claim political power in not only the Roman Empire but also, ultimately, in all nominally Christian lands. Eventually, the Donation of Constantine was rejected as false - but by then the Church had established itself in almost all of Europe, its power founded on a forgery - Arthur Kemp ( March of the Titans ) The \"Donation of Constantine\" emphatically insisted that the Church of Rome had g lobal reign and complete control in both secular and ecclesiastical life. There was to be no distinction between the two areas. Within the nine proclamations of political and sacerdotal authority there were two that gave to the Church legal sovereignt y. From the document's acceptance, the clergy, bishops, cardinals, and popes were to be regarded legally as above state law. Their judge was god not man.

Civilizations an d nations did not terminate of their own accord, and men of wisdom did not incarcerate themselves in dungeons or hang, draw, and quarter themselves in city squares. No! These heinous atrocities, perpetrated by sadists such as Bernard of Clairvaux and Friar Tomas de Torquemada, assisted the Church of Rome to remove those men and women who dared to stand up against their oppressive dominance throughout their land.

A god and church that favored individuality, freedom, expression, and equality, would be a major impediment to the sorcerers of the Earth. Few sane men would cringe in fear of their Earthly lords if their heavenly god was benign, permissive, and nonjud gmental. God commanded an unequal paradise where some angels outranked others and where they could be cast out for contending their place in the fixed hierarchy. And god's perfect ordered kingdom of heaven, full of obedient spirits, was to be mirrored belo w on Earth. The terrestrial emperors would see to it that a good Christian feared god and never strayed from his station. Progress was unnecessary because life itself was unimportant. A god - fearing man should not think of ways of improving his worldly lot. Only the excessively vain and sensual thought of such a reprehensible thing. The Church smiled on man's suffering and degradation and preached it as a sign of his recalcitrance and distance from god. Moreover, the rulers of man's destiny knew all too well that the man who believed himself the inhabitant of a devil - infested world beset by dangers was likely to remain mentally autistic. He would be superstition - ridden and overwhelmed by a sense of impotence. Such a creature must consider the life he lived to be a life of sin and the world to be a vale of temptation.

The Church knew that its own dominance was threatened by thinking men. Therefore, it not only incinerated the works of earlier nations such as the Irish but made sure that the world would be deliberately kept in ignorance. The Church of Rome would decide who was privileged enough to gain an education. Anyone found flaunting their edicts and prohibitions, anyone owning or reading the bible without permission, was a heretic to be made an example of. The Church burned enormous amounts of literature. In 391 Christians burned down one of the world's greatest libraries in Alexandria, said to have housed 700,000 rolls. All the books of the Gnostic Basilides, Porphyry's 36 volumes, papy rus rolls of 27 schools of the Mysteries, and 270,000 ancient documents gathered by Ptolemy Philadelphus were burned.

Just possessing a copy of the Bible in a vernacular translation was grounds for the death penalty.

The bishops knew the inwardly divided man is submissive and controllable. At the beginning of Christianity there was no such taboo against sexuality but by the time of Augustine of Hippo the body was seen as an encumbrance keeping man from pure meditations and direct contact with god. The body and its needs dragged man to worldly life and sin. As Saint Jerome preached: Regard everything as poison which bears within it the seed of sensual pleasure Follow our Lord's example, and hate your body; if you love it, strive to lose it; says Holy Script ure, in order to save it; if you wish to make peace with it; always go armed, always wage war against it; treat it like a slave, or soon you yourself shall be its unhappy slave - (Words of an Augustinian Priest to the King of Poland.

He repudiates his own body, regards himself as recalcitrant, and accepts instruction from on high so that his soul, the only part of him that matters, might be saved from perditi on. The god of such a man is a god of intolerance and wrath. He will not tolerate the slightest infraction against his law. He is the Lord that must be obeyed. The only relationship possible with such a god is of the slave versus master variety. And this w as the plan from the outset. It was the intention of those who stage - managed Judeo - Christianity.

Rome and the Illuminati Jesuits were insidious. Wherever they operated their grasping interference in the sovereignty of independent nations, their accumulation of money, land and power on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church, in time, caused them to be distrust ed and hated. They could be masters of disguise. Many were adept at posing as Protestants. Highly intelligent, talented and trusted, a number appointed to the highest posts of government were later discovered to be Jesuits. State secrets were passed regula rly to the Roman Church - Richard Kelley Hoskins ( In the Beginning ) Papal Rome's dominance extended to kingdoms and countries such as Burgundy, Champagne, Lombardy, Italy, Germany, etc, but it caused many princes to openly rebel. Fredrick Barbarossa of Ger many was one of the first to challenge the rights of the Church to his country. This resistance worried the popes who already had their entire wealth threatened and confiscated during the invasions of Arabs and early Italians. Since then they learned to de vise ways to protect their vast assets and to deal with dissent from wealthy and powerful nobles. Their main strategy involved the creation of secret organizations that on the surface appeared, to their many members, to be anti - Catholic , or more correctly, Anti - Vatican . The strategy was so successful that several Catholic dignitaries and governments (particularly in France), oblivious to their true purpose, went ahead to decree prohibitions against the spread of Masonic lodges. Masonry was taken into France during the 18th century by the English elite. The first French lodge was launched at Dunkirk by Lord Derwentwater. This endeavor to spawn apparently anti - Catholic secret societies was probably spurred on when Rome's agents noticed, and began to be concern ed about, bone fide sects and societies that sought to undermine the awesome and ever - encroaching dominance of the popes. The most important and successful of these apparently anti - Catholic societies was known as the \"Order of the Illuminati.\" Far from bei ng anti - Catholic , as most of its members believed, it was founded by Catholic Jesuit Adam W eishaupt and its members and branches operated throughout the world to serve Rome's long term agenda.

Moreover, the popes and bishops could cleverly condemn these orders, of their own making, as the spawn of Satan and could play upon that fear ad infinitum , thus galvanizing their own waning authority throughout the world. Arguably, the presence of ostensibly rational and progressive secret societies has done more to ensure the survival of the Church than anything else, particularly during the ages when its existence was most threatened. I saw that the Jesuits had several times interfered in it: and that most of the exceptionable innovations and dissentions had arisen about the time that the order of Loyola was suppressed: so that it should seem, that these intriguing brethren had attempted to maintain their influence by the help of freemasonry - John Robinson ( Proofs of a Conspiracy , 1789) I have met with many particular facts, which convince me that this use had been made of the meetings of Masons, and that at this time the Je suits interfered considerably, insinuating themselves into the Lodges, and contributing to increase that religious mysticism that is to be observed in all the ceremonies of the order.

From its birth during the reign of Constantine and Theodosius, it took centuries for the Vatican to amass its vast fortunes. Since the Second W orld W ar, however, that same wealth has been dwarfed into insignificance by those from global corporate investm ents and involvement in the economy of the United States of America. The Vatican‟s move into corporate investment gathered momentum around 1920, during the wars of revolution in Mexico, when patriots stripped the Vatican of its temporal rights and possess ions, returning them to the people. Desperate as to their precarious situation the Vatican attempted to warn and spur the American government to suppress the various Mexican rebel factions. The attempts of the Vatican to incite war between Mexico and Ameri ca failed due to the intervention of President Theodore Roosevelt. Nevertheless, the Vatican attempted to arrange the assassination of the new Mexican president and succeeded in fomenting massacres that destabilized the country.

A lot of intellectuals had left the Church in order to join the Illuminati and many, inspired by Communist ideas, were predicting the end of religion. After their campaign of infiltration ceased, the Vatican - S oviet conspiracy ended and the Vatican immediately began backing Italy's new president, the Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, forming a Fascist - Catholic agreement, ratified by the so - called \"Lateran Treaty\" of 1929. It was a most profitable deal since Mus solini restored to the Church its Papal States (Vatican City) that it had lost to Italian nationalists in September of 1870. In one stroke the dictator re - established the sovereign power of the Vatican. His action allowed the Vatican to grow more powerful than it had ever been, to regain lost wealth and status and to move toward corporate domination of the world that had the audacity to defy its authority, via revolution and war (American, French, and Spanish - American), by Romanticism and Naturalism, and by Communism and Atheism. Following the Lateran Treaty of February 1929, the then reigning Pope, Pius XI, set up a special agency to administer the 100 million dollars which Fascist Italy had put into Vatican coffers...Mussolini had agreed to exempt most of the Vatican's investments from taxation, thus indirectly adding more millions to those already received - Avro Manhattan Physically the Vatican had been reduced to the tiniest state in the world - an independent ecclesiastical machine and working theocracy poised on a speck of dust. The sum she received, although seemingly a large one, was small in view of the thousands of square miles she had to surrender. Yet the millions she got as \"compensation\" were the seeds of the billions she was to collect in the f ollowing decades. She had almost discarded her traditional ways of collecting the riches of this earth; from now on she would multiply her millions in the same ways as contemporary society - that is, she was going to beat the great industrial and financial concerns, trusts and corporations of the world at their own game...The years 1929 - 30, therefore, became a milestone in the annals of the Catholic Church, for if the Lateran Treaty closed an era, it also simultaneously opened another. It was the beginning of a period when the wealth of the future would surpass beyond imagination the riches of the past - Avro Manhattan Long before Mussolini was even born, back in the 1800s, the Vatican had already formed its own banks; the Bank of the Holy Spirit and the Ban k of Rome.

It presented the Vatican with dominion over the industrial and technical world t hat had no time for its archaic god or its terrestrial exploitation. Instead of becoming a relic of the past after the age of Enlightenment, instead of breathing its last due to the rise of Communism and Atheism, the Vatican found itself stronger and wealt hier than ever. Its most feared enemies had come and gone. There were no invading barbarian hordes or people's revolutions to threaten its autocracy. Heretics had started other churches while Romantics had disclaimed its god. Intellectuals had criticized t he logic and veracity of its holy book and antinomian free - thinkers had exposed its heinous moral violations. Lands had been confiscated and given back to the people by nationalists and yet, after a few years, power was once again handed to the Vatican on a plate. God certainly did work in mysterious ways. The increasing prosperity of industry resulted from the mounting belligerent policy of the Vatican's partner, Fascist Italy. For Mussolini...embarked upon his first large - scale foreign aggression. He atta cked, invaded and occupied Ethiopia (1936). The Catholic Church blessed the venture. Priests and bishops sprinkled departing troops, war planes, tanks and guns with holy water.

Yes, war was an earner. Even though Europe was decimated and although borders were closed and travel severely restricted, the agents of the Vatican could move freely throughout Europe to car ry on their financial dealings. Monies were moved around, taken in and out of countries, while all sorts of deals continued to be made. Nothing abated or impeded the economic enterprise of the Church. The Vatican was also able to make good use of its inter national intelligence network and knew what direction to move after it appeared their great protector and benefactor, Hitler, was in trouble. Toward the end of the Second W orld W ar the Vatican secretly began moving its assets to Canada and America. This de ed would protect their holdings from the Communists should they, after the fall of Fascism, rise to power in Italy. Through its support of the Fascists, the Vatican inherited untold wealth.

W hen the General nullifie d the treaty with the Nazis, Hitler was forced against his will to postpone his invasion of Russia for four months.

Recalling the General's account, Manhattan wrote: He claimed to have come across financial and diplomatic documents which revealed the extent to which certain Italian financial interests had been involved in supplying war materials to Yugoslavia, controlling interests in Yugoslav armament manufacture and, above all, closely linked with the Nazi war machinery, and that these were closely"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"associated with concerns directly manipulated by the Vatican wizard Nogara.

The criminality and brutality of the Ustashi surpassed that of the Nazis. And yet, for all their fanatical sadism, their deeds a re insignificant when compared to those of the Vatican that funded them. It does, however, provide one horrific glimpse into the dementia that pervades the minds of these most \"holy\" of god's sons. The Ustase tried to exterminate all Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, and basically all who opposed them or did not hold to their Roman Catholic religion and Croatian nationalism, including some Communist Croats and dissident Croat Byzantine Catholic priests. Once they came to power during World War II, they founded several concentration camps, the most notorious of which was the Jasenovac complex. Exact numbers of victims are not known, only estimates exist. The number of murdered Jews is fairly reliable: around 32,000 Jews were killed during WWII on NDH territory. Gypsies ( Yugoslav Roma) numbered around 40,000 fewer after the war.

The answer to the question is a difficult one...unofficial estimates by Italian governments at various times, based on scanty information they were able to come by, seemed to coincide with the nebulous hints dropped by the Vatican. According to these estimates, the Holy See owned between 15 and 20 percent of the total stocks quoted on the Italian Stock Exchange. In December 1964 the total value of all these shares was 5,500 billion lire, which put the capital invested by th e Vatican, as early as 1964, in Italian stocks alone, at about 500 million dollars.

Let us not argue at this juncture as to whether this \"god\" exists or not. Let us assume for convenience that he does exist. W e are told then that god is far and away removed from the material sphere of existence that he made, but which is lower in the ontological continuum than higher states frequented by those angels and ministers of light appointed to do god's bidding, and to keep the universe in order and functioning Behind the pope is the Jesuit \"black pope\""},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"correctly.

These souls are not good in themselves, but they can be made perfect by the divine intercessor sent from god on their behalf. Akhenaton frequently emphasized that he, and he alone, was the go - between for this new divine life of Egypt. The sole god of Egypt was now mediated through Akhenaton. At the close of the ̳Great Hymn to the Aten‘ it says, ―There is no one who knows you, except your son, Akhenaton‖ - Lorraine Evans ( Kingdom of the Ark ) The private wager of the elites within the Cult of Aton was that this preposterous theological travesty would eventually be accepted by the world and that the presence of the mediator would be strongly anticipated and desired. An d they were correct. It was accepted, and the cult of the Messiah was born. Once a man accepted the role of one interpreter and mediator he was a mere step away from accepting a whole gaggle of them. The Church took birth from this fabricated and valueless precept. In order to allay frustration at the physical absence of the spiritual mediator the Church simply declared itself to be the authorized place - holder for the mediator. The mediator - Jesus Christ - came, lived a short human life once in history and then departed, but not before he authorized the Church to be a new mediator in his name. Since the earliest pagan mediator (to the Persians, Syrians, and Phoenicians, and Mandeans, etc) was Sophia (the representation of man's rational ability to ascertain the mysteries of god), so the Church would style itself on the feminine principle so beloved of the pagan nations. The appointed pope would, henceforth, be both father and \"holy mother.\" He would dress like a female and declare himself to be the immaculat e intercessor and recapitulator of the \"word of god.\" Jehovah, the consort - less \"All - Father,\" could now have his masculinity even more emphasized by the relative feminine disposition of his proxy. Later, the mythographers saw to it that, in figurative art, the image of Jesus would be customarily feminized to further embed the"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"idea concerning Jehovah's virility and potency. In this way the believer would think himself most fortunate and would avoid other mystical traditions that could not offer as virile and awesome an archetype.

The hair of Moses was turned white by this god of volcanoes and earthquakes and the world's hair must turn likewise. This god is t o be feared as well as revered and no other god or deity is to be placed before him for he is most jealous and vengeful. The humbled ones with their bended knees and downcast eyes were never to know that the dogma of the mediator was not in the least part original to Judeo - Christianity but that it was plagiarized wholesale from the Mandeans, Philistines, Persians, Etruscans, Babylonians, Syrians, Ophites, Nassenes, Ebionites, Perates, Sethians, Heliognostics, Sophics, Therapeutae, Brahmins, and ancient Egyp tians, all of whom had their \"Protogonos,\" their \"Protector,\" their \"Sentinel,\" their \"Advocate,\" and their \"Lord of Lords,\" sent from above. They all subscribed to the belief in the redemption of the soul of man from its grave of darkness by a mediatory b eing, originally hidden in God and then expressly awakened or appointed by him for this purpose...they clothed their expected Messiah with the attributes of the Mandaic god of Mediation, and they appear...to have taken particular pleasure in the description of the scene where God calls (―awakes‖) the Redeemer to his mediatory office and installs him as Deliverer, Ruler of the World, and Judge of the living and the dead - Arthur Dewes ( The Christ Myth ) Constantine upon his solar throne.

The preposterous nonsense of new Israelite Kingdoms in the W est, as spouted and screamed from the pulpits by rabid mou thed Atonists and British - Israelites, arose because of a deliberately erroneous interpretation concerning Genesis Chapter 48. This chapter concerns the blessing of Jacob upon his grandson's Ephraim and Manasseh. These two boys were the sons of Jacob's favo rite son Joseph and were, suggestively, born in Egypt while Joseph was \"Governor\" (or Atonist Commander) there. The boys are blessed and Joseph is informed that they will go on to found the great \"Israelite\" nations of the future. And Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel‘s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel‘s right hand, and brought them near unto him. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim‘s head, who was the younger, and his left han d upon Manasseh‘s head, guiding his hands wittingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn...And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; he held up his father‘s hand, to remove it from Ephraim‘s head unto Man asseh‘s head...And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he shall become a people, and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations - (Genesis 48) As exp lained earlier, this Joseph was himself descended from Jacob. Jacob, the brother of Esau, was later re - named Israel. He was the son of Isaac. And Isaac was the son of Sarai, not by way of Abraham (as official legend has it), but by way of Tuthmosis III, th e warrior pharaoh of Egypt's eighteenth dynasty.

However, since both this pass age and the bible in which it is found are elaborate concoctions of the Cult of Aton, the chances of finding this evidence are, like our chance of finding sense in it, minimal at best. There is a further important point to bring out regarding this strange passage. It concerns the secret societies and the symbolism they employ and also where that symbolism comes from. One of the most powerful secret societies that orchestrates world events goes by the name \"Order of the Skull and Bones.\" It is also known as the \"Brotherhood of Death.\" The symbol of this order is a death's head skull with two crossed arm bones beneath which is the number 322. This number connotes the Spring Equinox and the sign of Aries. Astrologically, Aries is a \"Cardinal Fire.\" It is sacred to Atonists who divided from their rivals because of the precessional changeover from the astrological \"Age of Taurus\" to the \"Age of Aries,\" that began taking place approximately 1400 years BC, during the reign of Akhenaton. Before it was employed by the Skull and Bones, the emblem was used by the Knights Templar. Today it can be seen in the architecture of monasteries, Templar churches, Vati can City buildings, and it was used by the pirates commissioned by the Atonist Tudor dynasty of England. It was also used as a symbol by the Nazis during their British - backed destruction of Germany. There have been many speculations as to where this strang e and sinister motif actually originated. It is our belief that it may have its origins in Genesis Chapter 48 and in the blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh. Joseph brought the sons to Jacob that he might bless them, and bestow the birthright on the eldest so n. Aware of Jacob‘s poor vision, he was careful to place Manasseh, the eldest son, in position to receive Jacob‘s right hand on his head.

The Dark Side of the Sun Astrology is one of the most ancient forms of superstition, and is found prevailing among the nations of the east at the very dawn of history. The Jews became much addicted to it after the Captivity - (Chambers' Encyclopedia ) Those writers and investigators who have accused Adam W eishaupt, Albert Pike, Giuseppe Mazzini, Adriano Lemmi, and other Illuminati grand masters of being \"Luciferians\" would do well to acknowledge the ancient roots of this ideology so beloved of the cultists they expose. The origin of Luciferianism is Atonism. And the master masons of the world would much prefer it if this fact was never openly revealed. They prefer people to connect their god Lucifer with the horne d devils and tempting demons of Christian lore. That kind of distracting error serves to obscure the complexion and nature of their bizarre doctrine. The initiated insider is the one to whom Lucifer's true nature is revealed. He is the one to be exalted by knowledge. After his blindfold is removed before the altar, it is he who will be illumined and enlightened by the radiance of Lucifer, or more correctly, of Aton.

Their solar god was mov ing his domain. That is, the sun was transiting, precessionally , from the sign of Taurus into that of Aries. Akhenaton, like some fixated astronomer in a garret, considered this astrological transition to be of supreme importance. He saw it as a sign that times were changing and that old paradigms and gods were to depart from the world. They were to be replaced by Aton, god of light. The sign of Aries signifies power, strength, and aggression. It is a “fire” sign and it stands for the energies of war, belli gerence, conflict, and dominance. These, and other such masculine traits, would become exalted in the world during the so - called “Age of Aries.” Akhenaton saw himself as the mediator for his sun god. He would set about eradicating the old ways and would, l ike the Old Testament‟s John the Baptist, prophesize and explain to the world what was to come. He knew what was coming because he was in divine connection with his god. He was the chosen one and had the power and authority to have his particular sermon he ard by all. He would not tolerate resistance or argument from those houses, priests, or individuals who remained loyal to an old paradigm. His was, quite literally, a New World Order to be accepted without question. Akhenaton frequently emphasized that he, and he alone, was the go - between for this new divine life of Egypt. The sole god of Egypt was now mediated through Akhenaton. At the close of the ̳Great Hymn to the Aten‘ it says, ―There is no one who knows you, except your son, Akhenaton‖ - ibid No man h ath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him - (John 1:18) Our analogy to John the Baptist is not merely a device. We believe that this semi - fictional biblical character was also styled on Akhen aton. The severing of the Baptist‟s head symbolizes castration of authority and power. This loss was experienced by Akhenaton after he was exiled from his land for his crimes. At that point he became a wanderer in the desert proclaiming the return of an al l - powerful savior. Authors Picket and Prince, in their fine work Templar Revelation, reveal John the Baptist's Egyptian connection. Official investigators recognize that John was the heir to the Zadokite dynasty that dated to the time before Solomon. They show that John, like Simon Magus, also preached to non - Jews during his life and that he probably hailed from Alexandria in Egypt. John had great antipathy toward the Jewish run Temple in Jerusalem. A Church of John was found in Ephesus that had been founde d by Apollos of Alexandria. Simon Magus, a Gentile (Samaritan) master, also preached from Ephesus. The Judeo - Christian doctrine is an Atonist doctrine. This means that it involves the veneration of what may be described as the dark side of the sun. Light has many usages and many metaphysical facets. There is physical light, and there is mental light. Both obey very similar laws. Indeed, as the science of light reveals, inner light may be the only kind of light there is.

He is the Phoenician and Persian Yawnah , the W elsh Jawnah , the German Donar , and the English Jon (meaning \"sun\") . Aton is Adni or Agni , the sun lord of the Hindus. He is Don of the ancient Irish and Adonis of the Phoenicians. The Druids, who taught in the schools of these cities, brought the world the original unadulterated solar theocracy later corrupted into Atoni sm and Judeo - Christianity. Akhenaton not only brought political havoc to his country, he brought theological havoc to the world of religious ideas as well. He and his coterie, the \"Brotherhood of the Snake,\" did not worship light in the manner of the Druid s. Their understanding of the sun and of light was not akin to that that we possess today. Judeo - Christianity is the child of Atonism and is also controlled by those elites involved in the worship of what might be referred to as \"the dark side of the sun.\" Another word for this kind of worship is Luciferianism . Lucifer is a god of light, or rather, of the dark side of light . The secret fraternities that preserve the most antique doctrines of the Druids, Chaldeans, and Medes, are also responsible for turning the gnosis of light into a travesty in order to deceive the human race. If one were to say that Aton was Lucifer they would be quite right. If one were to say that Jehovah was Lucifer they would also be correct. As author Brinsley Le Poer Trench wrote in his book Sky People : It is very plainly put in arcane literature that Jehovah was originally a Lord of Mars. He is also the god of battles...Mars and its lord are somehow deeply associated with strife and violence, affecting and afflicting that type of human ity inhabiting the Earth The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is his name - (Exodus 15:3) Beauty has a dark side. Sexuality has one. Mercy has a dark side and so does love. Anger has a good side and hate also. This is the way that the ancients saw life. For gods of light there were the gods of darkness. For gods of the overworld there were the gods of the underworld."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"However, it would be more correct to say that the gods of light had a dark side. It was only later, after the ruination of the original stellar gnosis, that mythmongers and priests began to push the notion that the two aspects of a single archetype were distinct entities, separate, divided, adversarial, and irreconcilable. Nothing of this kind was taught in the mystery schools of old. It is a conc oction of the perverse and it has caused untold folly to occur. Aton, like Jehovah, has his two sides; the benign and the wrathful. This dualism has caused scholars incessant trouble. All would have been revealed had the original simple truth been preserve d. It is the mind of man that is divided and fragmented and so the world that a man perceives takes on a dualistic complexion. This dualism begins with the symbol of the sun, and with the phenomena of light. The sun gives warmth and the sun illuminates. Bu t the sun can also scorch and blind. The sun is attractive but it can not be gazed upon directly. The sun is magnificent and powerful yet its heat and light are finite. A match or a candle, a torch or a flame, burns brightly and attractively but burns to b urn out. Yes, there are many properties of light that we might not be too aware of. To the ancients the sun had at least three faces or aspects. There was the sun in the morning, the sun at midday, and the sun at evening.

Take t his analogy up a notch to the metaphysical level and we gain insight into the manner in which the Illuminati, the Princes of Light, operate to attain the power that does not belong to them by right. Such is the intrigue of the Luciferians. Lucifer is, howe ver, not the same thing as Satan. The word Satan simply meant \"one who tempts\" and it merely referred to any contradicting, skeptical, or accusatory agent and their argument. W ithin holy orders, like the Essenes and Gnostics, a \"Satan\" was any detractor or opposition party. There was nothing supernatural about a Satan. There is little doubt that the term and concept has its origins in the Egyptian god Set, the opposer of Horus his twin. To oppose any hegemony is, therefore, to be \"Satanic.\" So we see that t here is a big difference between Satan and Lucifer. Lucifer was originally based upon the pagan god Mars and, eventually, Satan also became identified with the red fiery planet and its astrological energy. In the bible we have Jesus turning to Peter saying \"get thee behind me Satan.\" If we accept Jesus to be the sun then we can take this statement to be of Astro - Theological significance. Mars occasionally rises heliacally, that is, with or even before the sun. The priests of the sun would exclaim from their temples \"get thee down\" or \"get thee below\" or \"get thee behind Satan,\" in order not to have their deity be ousted, rivaled, and outshone. Interestingly, the symbol of Mars (an arrow) can be seen (in miniature) on the central panel of the rosette window a bove the door of number 10 Downing Street in London, England. Nowhere in the Genesis account is there any mention, direct or indirect, of Satan‘s involvement, and yet it has become common practice for the Church to portray the serpent as an emissary of Sat an, or even as Satan himself - Laurence Gardner Symbols reveal to us a great deal. Christians have long revered and employed the symbol of the fish. However, the word for fish was luce that gives Lucifer. So, was Jesus a \"Lucifer,\" a \"Son of the Morning,\" a \"Son of the Sun?\" Mary Magdalene was also referred to as \"Lucifer.\" We don‟t doubt that the term has also been employed with the cabals of the Gaonim and Masons to denote their high ranking initiates. Now, a Christian is, in fact, a Luciferian . This fact is not altered one jot by the resistance and rebuttal of Christians. Christians, Muslims, and Jews, are worshippers of light, although most have never spent a minute of their lives thinking about light and exactly what its properties are. They do not need to think.

At daybreak, when thou arisest on the horizon, When thou shinest as the Aton by day, Thou drivest away the darkness and givest thy rays - opening lines of Akhenaton's Hymn to the Aton (from which the Biblical Psalms of Solomon derive) The term or title Lucifer originally referred to the solar Christ who was, from an Egyptian perspective, born when the sun entered into the sign of Virgo. This action began the Egyptian New Year. The Egyp tian New Year opened in the summer not winter. The present date for the birth of Jesus Christ - December 25 (Christmas) - was actually that for John the Baptist, the radical preacher and rival of the Jerusalem Church. This is why January bears the name it does. Jan is Jon or John - literally the time of John . And January corresponds to the astrological sign of Aquarius, the \"W ater - Bearer\" (the sign of Baptism). The true sun kings of old, the \"Christs,\" were given solar symbolism due to the fact that they we re brought into life and celebrated during the rise of the star Sirius, an event that occurred during the summer month of July, or during the signs of Leo and Virgo. Virgo was the Virgin who, astrologically speaking, gave birth to the sun - child. This sun - c hild was known as Lucifer, the son of the morning or dawning, the bright young star (youngster). Later these dates, together with the symbolism, were inverted and the sun - child was said to have been born in the middle of winter. The role of John was downpl ayed and the role of Christ made more conspicuous. Secret societies, like the Knights Templar and their appropriately named associates the Knights of St. John, continued to honor the truth. They continued to venerate the severed and bearded head - the head of John the Baptist. The \"Christs ,\" or sun kings are, to this day, associated with the sun and the lion due to ancient astrological reckoning. The \"Lion of Judah\" was the term used by the leaders of the sun churches and is still used as an epithet. The op ening of the Egyptian new year corresponded with the rise of the sacred star Sirius and with the rising of the waters of the Nile. This rising was most auspicious and it occurred during the week of July 25, in the sign of Leo. The river's waters brought li fe to the parched land. The crops and vines began to grow and thrive throughout the sign of Virgo. So it was said that the sun of god, the light of the world (Lucifer), was born of a Virgin . This is why the Egyptian sphinx has the front of a woman and the body of a lion. The sphinx was a symbol for the opening and closing of the Egyptian stellar year.

It is as simple as that. Therefore, to worship the gods of light is to be, quite literally - a Luciferian. Lucifer is, however, the deceiver and obscurer of the truth. W ell, the sun does obscure the truth. Every morning upon its rise it draws a veil of light across the theatre of the night sky, the original mystery school and analogue of the inner dome of the head and the deeper recesses of the an cestral mind. The night sky was the body of the goddess, the primal mother Nuith. As physical sunlight obscures the mysteries of the night, so does the inner psychological sun of ego consciousness obscure the deeper mysteries of self and being.

By virtue of this, they are night operatives, and melatonin is called the ̳the hormone of darkness,‘ being produced only at night or in the dark...Exposure to an excess of natural light makes the pineal gland smaller and lessens spiritual awareness, whereas darkness and high pineal activity enhance the keen intuitive knowledge of the subtle mind, while reducing the stress factor. Melatonin i s manufactured by the pineal gland through an activated chemical messenger called ̳serotonin.‘...Melatonin also enhances and boosts the body‘s immune system, and those with high pineal secretion are less likely to develop cancerous diseases.

The philosophy of masonry is patently solar and, although it may not be strictly \"monotheistic,\" there can be little doubt that masons are, metaphysically speaking, primarily concerned with the veneration of light . Ad ditionally, the mason is fixated on the image and symbolic significance of the temple of the sun god. The very word mason implies architecture. Masonry's supreme tutelary archon is referred to as \"The Grand Architect of the Universe.\" In a similar way as t he masters of the Renaissance, the masons are obsessed with mathematical and geometric order. Their \"House,\" \"Temple,\" and \"Altar\" are expressions of the order that exists in the cosmos and that must exist within man's inner temple, within his mind. The li ght of the outer world is the analog of the metaphysical light of reason within the minds of men. Rational men, brothers in the light of knowledge, assemble in a sacred and secure place, a precinct unadulterated by the rank and file who remain on the hylic (base) level of existence. The temple, then, takes on a double meaning. It can be a physical edifice of stone and steel or it can be the company of the brethren. Perhaps the secret is that the masons are the descendants, physically or ideologically, of th e old temple builders, or perhaps even of the ancient priests of the sun who chose the pharaoh and dominated the ancient land of Egypt. Perhaps their references to the temple are suggestive of their origins. Perhaps the temple they are attempting to create is that which was once destroyed. Perhaps the light they revere is the light of \"Aton the Great\" - before whom both priests and pharaohs bowed. Their principle desire was the restructuring of the Temple of Solomon - Alberto Rivera Freemasonry is simply Th eosophy. It is the perpetuation of the worship of the old pagan gods of ancient Egypt - Rev. Penney Hunt ( The Menace of Freemasonry ) One of the most important functions of the masonic order involves the preservation of the rites and rituals that were Druid ic in origin. They were commissioned to keep these arcane practices intact. It was never to be openly divulged and certainly never used for the benefit of the ordinary slave - unit in society. It was a powerful symbolic archive that would be used to empower and protect the elites of the world, and those defilers who had commissioned the annihilation of the Druids and the obliteration of Ireland's stellar church. Masonry, successor of the Mysteries, still follows the ancient manner of teaching. Masonry is iden tical with the ancient Mysteries - Albert Pike ( Morals and Dogma , 1871)"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"These sacred mysteries were the same amongst the priests of the Maya...the Druids, and the priests of Egypt, and the same as we practice - Albert Churchward ( The Arcana of Freemasonry ) Just because a library gets burned to the ground does not necessarily imply that its books are burned as well. Just as the books of the Catholic monks ended up in the libraries of the Tudor dynasty after Henry VIII decided to burn down all the monasteries during a period referred to by historians as the \"Dissolution of the Monasteries,\" so, in previous ages the Druids had had their works confiscated and sequestered by the very forces attacking them. The Druids, we are told, were mostly involved with an ora l tradition and an oral transmission of knowledge. But whose word must we take for this? That is the rather unnerving question. W e can surmise that the Druids and Bards, like the Scalds and Brahmins, did indeed write things down. W e can also surmise where these texts are languishing today. In any case, the ancient rituals and symbols of the Druids are not lost. They are constantly employed by those men who have appropriated them and who consider themselves keepers of an ancient archive to which they have no moral right.

The Number 13 The number 13 is utilized by Freemasons the world over. It is used by occult fraternities because long ago the number was once sacred to the Druids. Since the destruction of the Dr uids the number has been appropriated by the Masons and Atonists and is used to empower them in their political and social rituals. Th e flag of the European Union. Twelve obvious pentagrams and one that can be made from the rest, making 13 in all The chief executive of the modern European Union operates from the thirteenth floor of their headquarters in Brussels, and the number can be found in dozens of permutations on the American one - dollar bill. The flag of the European Union contains thirteen stars, twelve obvious stars and one invisible star that can be geometrically configured from the circle of twelve. As investigator into masonr y, Eustace Mullins, reminds us, the Rockefeller family chose number 1313 as a street address to establish their organization called the “Council of State Governments” that would oversee state legislatures. Two times 13 equals 26 - the number of god. In Heb rew, Egyptian, and English, the letters of the word god total 26. In the Hebrew language, the letters of the word Jehovah (IHVH - 10, 5, 6, 5) come to 26. And as we know, Jehovah is Aton. Furthermore, in the year 1813 the Duke of Sussex, the son of King George III became the Grand Master of Freemasonry in England and, thereafter, thirteen stars as well as a Star of David appeared on American currency. W e can understand the idea within the minds of the Cult of Aton elites. Given that they had once enjoyed pharaonic power, we can understand that they again coveted custody of all nations. Being expelled from their great thrones only made them more avaricious in this regard. By way of open political manipulation, as well as by more covert means, they have depo sed rivals who stood in their way. In the place of those usurped, the Atonists have set up their own kings, princes, lords, and governors. Their minions now occupy the seats"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"of world power. Since they are descended from the Hyksos \"Dragon Court,\" and since they were kin of the high priests of the temple of Heliopolis, they are distinguished as well as notorious for their occult knowledge and expertise. This occult knowledge is coupled with worldly desire and enflamed with avarice and hubris. The combination is deadly to those outside the cabal but most agreeable to those who seek control over minds and nations. Those who have once enjoyed pharaonic authority and control are not going to easily relinquish that kind of power again should it ever be lost to the m. In fact, logic dictates that such power - hungry men will do anything to regain and maintain dominion should it be within their reach. The Atonists reward allies who assist them in their venture for power as surely as they undermine and destroy rivals who block their advance. To play those millions of minds, to watch them slowly respond to an unseen stimulus, to guide their aspirations without their knowledge - all this whether in high capacities or in humble, is a big and endless game of chess, of ever e xtraordinary excitement - Sidney Webb (co - founder of the Fabian Society) Naturally, there are those voices who refute the idea that the Orders of Freemasonry have any such allegiance. Nevertheless, those who have done their homework and spent time tracking the connections between Freemasonry, religion, and politics, are not wavered in their suspicion of dark intent. It is not the street level lodge members that are malign or of concern. It is the bloodline masons from prominent royal dynasties who are the s ubject of a critique of Freemasonry. As any organization is wont to do, the masons work to endear the curious by admitting membership of men whose creative or intellectual greatness is publicly held in high regard. The Weishaupt documents are incontestably authentic; the Bavarian government unwittingly forestalled any attempt to cry ―Forgery‖ (in the manner made familiar in our century) by inviting any who were interested to inspect the original documents in the Archives at Munich - Douglas Reed ( Controvers y of Zion ) Behind the masonic lodges hides the same \"Brotherhood of the Snake,\" or Cult of Aton, that created Christianity (and its many denominations), that established the Vatican, and set its many popes, bishops, and priests in place.

Let us not doubt why it is that Per me reges regnant (\"through me kings reign\") is a chief masonic m otto. Let us not doubt what historical person masons have enthroned at the top of their Egyptian pyramid. In his definitive work, The Magical Mason, W. Wynn Westcott, the founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in England, traces the origins of th e Freemasons back to the Essenes in Jerusalem; Pharisaic Jews, the practitioners of the most strict Judaism; the ancient Mysteries of Egypt and Greece; the Vehm - Gerichte of Westphalia"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"in Germany; the trade guilds of the Middle Ages; the Roman Collegia; the French Compagnons; and the Rosicrucians - Eustace Mullins ( Curse of Canaan ) The ghost of Akhenaton looms large over Martin Luther - Ralph Ellis ( Tempest and Exodus ) The fact that the central symbolism of masonry involves the \"Temple of Solomon\" should hav e alerted us to this fact long ago. Indeed Freemasons, who refer to themselves as \"Sons of the Sun\" are distinguished by the symbols they commonly use on their lodges and in their literature. Indeed, it is by a study of its symbolism that we can decode mas onry's true function and agenda. The three symbols that they universally employ are the Compass, the Square and the letter \"G.\" Many are the interpretations as to what these symbols mean and as to where they originate. A close reading of masonic documents reveals a plethora of information and disinformation regarding the origin and significance of these three symbols. Although space does not permit a thorough analysis, it is important to bring out something concerning the letter \"G.\" Scholars have concluded that it refers to god, to geometry, to Gaia (Earth), to generation (sex), to the Hunab Ku of the Maya, to Geb the ancient Egyptian god of the phallus and the Earth, and to the sacred spiral, etc. The enigmatic Masonic insignia \"G,\" that this author consid ers a cryptic signature of the Gaonim , is not unrelated to the Irish word Gnadir , that means \"serpent\" and that was used by the Druids as a title.

The Levite Colleges The Jews of the world looked to Babylon as the center of Talmudic government. The heads of the academies were called Gaonim. Even the princes - the Exilarchs (later Nasim) looked to them in all matters. All matters under dispute were referred to as the ―Gaonate.‖ There was total obedience to their ruling - Douglas Reed ( Controversy of Zion ) After the massacres an d devastation by Roman forces in Jerusalem, the Levites moved to the cities of Jamnia, Pumbedita, and Usha, in Babylon, and formed their talmudic academies that lasted for centuries. It was in these cities that the talmudists collated the esoteric knowled ge acquired from Egypt. It is from these cities that they conceived their plans for world domination. After their establishment in Babylon, the dispersed lower - class Israelites and Judites of the world knew to look to the talmudic academies for guidance an d education in Jewish history. Interestingly, the head potentates of these ancient academies were known as the Gaonim . These Gaonim were considered princes of sacred knowledge and, as such, they commanded the greatest reverence imaginable. It is, therefore , our opinion that these Levitical Gaonim , resident in Palestine and Babylon, were the descendants of the even more ancient Cult of Aton. Furthermore, it is our contention that the masonic letter or cipher \"G\" stands for these self - proclaimed Exilarchs, th e \"Princes of Light\" - the Gaonim .

The Frankfurt Lodge of Freemasonry was funded by the powerful Rothschild dynasty. Jews may rightly question why this wealthy Jewish merchant family would do getting involved with Masonry.

The most illustrious rabbi in Frankfurt, Zvi Hirsch was, along with Rothschild agent Sigismund Geisenheimer, th e chief founder of the lodge that had members from almost every powerful Jewish banking family in Frankfurt. Author Eustace Mullins reveals that the lodge, that was closely connected with the Paris Sanhedrin, was made up of members from the Rothschild, Adl er, Speyer, Hanuer, and Goldschmidt families. A little more research reveals that Duke Carl von Hessen of the aristocratic \"Black Nobility\" family of Schleswig was the head of all German masonry at the time. Gentiles might want, then, to question why such a nobleman would be doing heading masonic lodges made up of powerful Jews. Again, the anomaly is explained once we know the Atonist connections between European royals and oriental occultists. Powerful Atonist Jews enjoyed close occult affiliation not only with members of European royalty but also with the Vatican.

Red Shields and Red Carpets There is something behind the throne greater than the king himself - Sir William Pitt (1770) Secret societies such as the Illuminati, Templars, and Freemasons, have long been criticized for their apparently anarchistic and even Communistic tendencies and ideolog ies. The Church encourages the world to believe that these societies are breeding places for anti - Christian fervor, while governments have often portrayed them as politically \"Left W ing\" subversives. No doubt the Illuminati and Freemasons have attracted me mbers with such tendencies but, given the class of many masonic grand masters, we can see that they also attract members who are devoutly religious and who strongly favor monarchy. The Illuminist rhetoric against patriotism and their promotion of a one - wor ld government under a single mystagogue is comprehensible once the true origin of their hostility towards national sovereignty is revealed. They are against nationalism because of their allegiance to their sun god Aton before whom, they believe, all knees and nations should bow. But their apparently socialistic ardor is not merely a political expression as most people believe. If it was they would work openly within the political sphere to achieve their professed goals. Their worldly aspirations are based o n a mystical notion no different than that found among the priests of sun temples in Heliopolis, Amarna, Tanis, and Alexandria. This aspiration is compromised by the natural organic tendency of people to secularize and hold to national and tribal identity. W hat Pharaoh Akhenaton found reprehensible in his time, his ministers also find objectionable in theirs. In the Egypt of long ago, their solar overlord Akhenaton had been removed from his exalted throne by enemies who galvanized their people, restored nat ional pride, and permitted the worship of many gods.

He speaks of the secret tradition or agenda of Jesus. And he knew well what this meant. He goes on to say in his writings that this secret doctrine was part of a tradition handed down by a line of masters who \"hid themselves and their doctrine under the cover of Freemasonry.\" This doctrine of Christ could not be understood to the comm on man. It was known only by those men who were correctly initiated into its mysteries and who possessed the symbolic keys to decipher its secrets.

This provides them with a deeper insight into the masterplan than they previously possessed. This promotion is usually attended by material reward. This method has proved very successful down through the years and has served to silence potentially rogue voices. Some esteemed masons spoke openly against what they imagined to be the subversion of their humanitari an order. Perhaps, they took masonry for what it was meant to be, for what it was said to be, or for what they imagined it to be, as they reverently advanced through its many ranks. Masons are, after all, not the only ones to be duped by the company they k eep or by the societies they serve. In any case, the warning calls of the suspicious and aware, in masonry, went largely unheeded. Obviously, the pyramid and eagle are not American symbols. They are Egyptian in origin. The ancient hierogram for Asur (Osir is) was an eye above a throne. The word for eye was Akha, and its hierogram was an eagle, the bird with sharp eyesight. The vowel \"E\" was often erroneously interpolated and affixed to consonants instead of the more proper vowel \"A.\" Therefore, a name such as Akhenaton may be spelt Akhanaton , meaning \"Eye of Aton.\" And that is exactly what we see on the American one - dollar bill, on state insignia, and on corporations such as CBS, Kodak, Kindercare, and America Online, etc. In the Punjabi language the word fo r eye is Akh , that is also close to Ikh , which means \"the number one.\" W hen we see an eye, an eagle, or a throne, or see references to the number 1, we may be witnessing cryptic references to Akhenaton and his Cult of Aton.

The Knights of the Temple of Sol (Aton) All revolutionaries and murde rers since then had been part of a single 'Templar' society - including Cromwell, the murderer of Henry IV of France; conspirators in Portugal, Brazil and Sweden, and of course Robespierre and Danton - Edward Burman ( The Assassins - Holy Killers of Islam ) When examining the role of the Templars we need to first pay attention to their title. The masonic term \" Solomon \" does not refer to a place or a physical structure. It relates to the sun and to the cult of the sun. It relates to Aton and the light of Aton . As we have shown, modern researchers have offered evidence to show the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III, was one of the most likely candidates for the biblical King Solomon. And he was the father of Akhenaton. Although he openly venerated the state god Ame n Ra, Amenhotep III actively promoted the worship of Aton. His own title was \"The Dazzling Sun Disk of All the Land.\" So when we seek to determine the true time of origin of the so - called Templars we need to consider ancient Egypt and not eleventh century Burgundy. W hat arose in France of that period was merely an offshoot of a much more ancient order. Once this fact is understood, a study of the Templars and their affiliated organizations (Cistercians, Knights of St. John, Knights of Malta, Knights of Rhod es, and Order of Sion, etc), will make a great deal more sense. It is a very extraordinary thing that the Christian Templars should call themselves Templars in honour of the Temple, the destruction of which all Christians boasted of as a miraculous example of Divine wrath in their favour, as Christians. This goes to prove the Templars much older than the Crusades, and that the pretended origin of these people is totally false - Godfrey Higgins ( Anacalypsis, 1833) Amenhotep III, father of Akhenaton.

His title was \"Shining Solar Disk of All the Land\""},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"According to most official theories, the Templar s were first brought into existence by order of the Roman popes. However, the illustrious Templars families had allegiance to beings infinitely more exalted that the rotten power - mad bishops of Rome, Burgundy, and Champagne. Amenhotep III is actually depi cted seated in the distinctive ark of the sun god, thus identifying himself as the god while he was still alive! Furthermore, the following carvings depict the king and the divine statuary of Amen both being carried alongside sacred arks. This was a truly remarkable statement. No longer was Amenhotep III to be regarded as just a mere agent of the gods. Without prevarication, he was announcing to all those present that he was now to be regarded as a living god. Under normal circumstances, only upon death cou ld a pharaoh thus become deified...By openly declaring himself a god, he was now on an equal standing with Amen himself. Additional new material pertaining to Amenhotep‘s deification whilst alive has emerged over the past few years. Astonishingly, they depic t scenes of him worshipping figures of himself - Lorraine Evans ( Kingdom of the Ark ) W e agree wholeheartedly with the great scholar Godfrey Higgins who emphasized that the Templars were an older body than commonly supposed and that it was not founded durin g the time of the first crusade. The order merely allowed itself to become publicly known during that era. Its true origins go much further back in time. It helps us to know that the term Solomon refers to the sun in the languages of Indo - Europeans, Semite s, and Egyptians - Sol , Om and On . It is, therefore, not a name but a title. Like the titles David, Aaron, Jesus, Joshua, Joseph, John , and even Abraham and Mary, it does not refer to a person as much as to his dynasty, theology, and lineage. She was calle d Mary as a title, not a name. The word was a form of \"Miriam\" - Barbara Thiering ( Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls ) The name Christ is added to Jesus and is meant as a title, which is to indicate that spiritual perfection or the Messianic state has been att ained - Conor MacDari ...it is known that the princes of Egypt picked up a string of titles during their lives - Ralph Ellis ( Solomon: Falcon of Sheba ) Joshua, it seems, was an ancient sun - god, who was demoted to the status of a man by the priests of the Y ahweh cult. However, the worship of Joshua was continued in secret by his devotees, until the fall of Jerusalem - John G. Jackson ( The Pagan Origins of the Christ Myth ) The Knights Templar were, therefore, knights of the sun, the moon, and stars. They were an esoteric order that encapsulated the secret teaching of the solar, lunar, and stellar cults of antiquity. Even the most cursory perusal of the symbolism that this order and its affiliates employed confirms this to be true. The Templar Order was a repos itory for the arcane lore of ages, for the astrological gnosis that exalted the hierarchs of Christian (Atonist) Rome but that had to remain unseen and unknown to the common uninitiated believer.

In fact, the creators of the Knights Templar were the descendants of the Merovingian dynasty headquartered in France and that, according to the three authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail, had the biblical Jesus among their family members. This powerful dynas ty has been traced by some researchers back to the Amorites and to the Hyksos pharaohs of Egypt. The root mer referred to the pyramids and also to \"high officials\" (from Mer Per ). The syllable is found in the word Amero or Amarru , the name for the Amorites of ancient Syria and Babylon. One of Sumeria's oldest cities was known as Mari . It is possible that the Amorites and Hyksos were related by blood. It is also possible that the Hyksos moved to Syria and Babylon after being expelled from Egypt. After this m ove they may well have been known as Amorites , or \"Men of the Pyramids.\" As the majority of the historical accounts will relate, the Templars were formed to invade and capture the City of Jerusalem for the pope and for Christianity. Upon their successful c rusade, in 1099 AD, they established their headquarters at Jerusalem's Temple Mount. This is where their name is said to have originated. Some researchers into Templar history maintain that while they were residing in the \"holy land\" the Templar elite cult ivated long lasting collaborations with many Gnostic sects and secret societies. Among these secret affiliates were the Mandeans and Assassins. Interestingly, a chief hierophant of the Mandean sect had been John the Baptist who was entitled the \"King of Li ght.\" It is alleged that, since the time of the First Crusade, the Templars, as well as the Order of Sion, have maintained their veneration of John, the beheaded initiator of Christ. The Order of Sion, in particular, are believed to have entitled their own chiefs \"Jean\" or \"John,\" while a major worldwide Templar Order also dating from the crusades was known as the \"Knights of St. John.\" Allegedly, this allegiance to John was one of the reasons why the Templars were targeted by the Vatican hierarchs. The Kn ights Hospitaler were so named because they operated a hospital in Jerusalem to help pilgrims in distress...After the fall of Jerusalem and the final victory of the Moslems in 1291, the fortunes of both knightly orders changed. The Knights of St. John (Hos pitalers) were forced to flee the Holy Land. They took up residence on a succession of islands during the ensuing centuries. With the changes of location came changes in name. They became the \"Knights of Rhodes\" after moving to the island of Rhodes. They w ere the \"Knights of Malta\" when they moved to that island and ruled it. While on Malta, the Knights became a major military and naval power in the Mediterranean until their defeat in 1789 by Napoleon. After enjoying temporary protection under Russian Emper or Paul I, the Knights of Malta had their headquarters moved to Rome in 1834, by Pope Leo XIII. Today they are known as the \"Sovereign Order of the Knights of Malta (SMOM) and have the unusual distinction of being the world's smallest nation. Located in a walled enclave in central Rome, SMOM still retains its status as a sovereign state, although new Grand Masters of the Order must be approved by the Pope - William Bramley ( Gods of Eden )"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"The interesting fact is that the Mandeans, according to their own test imony, originated in Egypt not Judea or Israel. Their traditions reveal John to have been a highly respected magus from Alexandria whose teachings incorporated the feminine \"Sophic\" principle so offensive to the patristic Roman Church. Templar researchers insist that the Templar \"Christ\" was not Jesus but John, the initiate and hierophant of the solar colleges of Egypt. Certainly, the Vatican accused the Templars of venerating a severed bearded head. And as the bible relates, John the Baptist was decapitate d by his enemies. Symbolically of course, the act of severing the head can mean the transference of power and seniority from one grand master to another. The source of the symbolism is astrological. The sun is the head severed every winter. The rays (or ha ir) of the sun are reduced in radiance and power while the solar orb descends into the cold depths of winter. A female had connived the murder of the Baptist because the sun weakens and makes its descent into the realms of death through the female signs of Virgo and Libra. Alternatively, the long flowing hair of John can represent the feminine principle. The Templars are suspected of revering Mary Magdalene. The various kings of the Merovingian dynasty (those who formed the first European Templars) wore the ir hair long in the fashion of the Sikhs of Northern India. The Merovingian Templars were known as reges criniti, the \"Long Haired Kings.\" The worship and veneration of a severed head or of a skull has its origins among the Irish. Throughout Britain and E urope burial tombs have been found to contain ceremonial skulls representing the gods of the underworld into which the dead heroes and kings must pass for judgment and reward. The sacred precinct of the underworld was only horrific and gloomy to those soul s who had lived immorally. The Irish inaugurated their new kings on top of the cairns (tombs) of previous kings to show that all new life must come from that which has departed back within the body of the Earth goddess. This goddess was known to the ancien t Irish as Ari, Eri, or Tari, from which we derive Terra . The Egyptians knew her as Taurt. The pagan cult of the skull was adapted by the Christians and Templar architects and so we find faces and gargoyles, The skull and the female (goddess).

The motif turns up in the tale of Calvary when Jesus is crucified upon Golgotha (the \"Hill of the Skull\"). In context of the Atonists, the severed head symbol served to represent their preoccupation with the amputation of their pharaonic p ower at the hands of what they considered imposter kings and dynasties. This is, in our belief, the real message being transmitted through the story of the Herodian Salome and her strange antipathy to John. It is not John who was crying in the wilderness, but Akhenaton, the original \"King of Light.\" The majority of researchers trace the origins of the Templars to France of the eleventh century and the first Christian crusade. And it is true that some of the most illustrious and fascinating Templar personali ties lived during that time. Godfroi de Bouillon, Hugh de Champagne, Hugh de Payens, Andre de Montbard, Bernard de Clairvaux, Merovingian King Dagobert II, and other intriguing and powerful feudal nobles, participated in the first crusade that aimed at cap turing the holy city of Jerusalem from the Saracens. W e are fortunate that new light has been thrown on these rather shadowy and elusive figures of history. Light has also been thrown onto the connections that existed between the Merovingian dynasty, the T emplars, the Frankish (French) and Roman Catholic Church, and the Cistercian monastic order. According to authors, Alan Butler and Stephen Dafoe, the same families that were responsible for the creation of the Templars were also responsible for the rise of this powerful monastic order that once owned estates all over France and W estern Europe. They also stress the close parallels between the Cistercians and more ancient Essenes, the sect thought to have composed the Dead Sea Scrolls and influenced the early Christians. ...we can find no monastic institution anywhere near as similar to the Essene communities as that of the much later Cistercians - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) The brothers chose a white habit, meant to symbolize p urity...We cannot help but draw a comparison between the white vestments adopted...and those worn by the Essenes at Qumran - ibid What is more, Butler and Dafoe have found evidence to show that the elite families of Burgundy and Champagne, those at the hel m of Templarism, were educated by Culdean monks from Ireland. "},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":" This is significant since the Culdees were educated monks accused by Latin Christians of heresy and of having an excessive amount of pagan elements to their Christian theology. In other wo rds, the Culdees had been accused of being contaminated by Druidism. And so those who came under the tuition of the traveling Culdean monks were likewise thought to be in danger of contamination. This is the root of the accusations against the Templar Knig hts who, from the very outset of their order's official presence, had a suspicious look. The connection between the Templars and the Culdees is explored by Butler and Dafoe in their fine books The Knights Templar Revealed, and The Warriors and the Bankers. The authors reveal that King Dagobert II of the Merovingian dynasty had actually spent time in Ireland being educated by the Culdean monks. It was perhaps for this reason that the Vatican attempted to prevent him from becoming king of France. A strong and \"contaminated\" Frankish Christianity was a major threat to Roman dominion. William I of France had taken Britain under the name of Rom an Catholicism and the territory of the Frankish nobility was extensive. This fear appears to be the main reason why the Vatican preferred to support a Carolingian prince over Dagobert II. Perhaps France could be weakened by internal dynastic conflict and perhaps the installation of a compliant puppet king was the agenda behind the Vatican's political intrigue. Dagobert found himself at odds with Rome and this, according to the authors, prompted the Templar families of Burgundy and Champagne to conspire to overthrow the Roman Church in favor of their own \"contaminated\" version of Christianity. The Franks conquered territory far beyond the original borders of their homeland, extending down into northern Italy and threatening the autonomy of the Vatican. Ultim ately, feudal values were passed to the emerging Normans who in turn carried the principles, together with the now fully developed Roman Catholicism, to England after the Conquest of 1066 - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) "},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":" The coat of arms of the city of Troyes France, headquarters of the Meroving ian Templars.

In our opinion, the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties were connected to the Atonists of Egypt and to the Israelites of biblical history. Interestingly, the Merovingians descended from the female line of the Sicambrian Franks (a Germanic tribe, first century BC) whose kings referred to themselves as \"People of the Covenant.\" The Emperor Charlemagne was of Frankish blood. The Sicambri are believed to have been related to the ancient Scythians whose kings and princes had close connections to Egypt of the 18th dynasty, and to the Milesian (Atonist) conquerors of Ireland. The kings of the Merovingian dynasty wore their hair long in to emulate a lion's mane, and were believed to possess birth marks betw een their shoulder blades in the shape of a red cross. One of the main symbols of the Merovingians was the fish, that Christians used to signify Jesus. The Latin word for fish is luce , that connotes Lucifer, that is, Aton . King Dagobert of the Merovingian dynasty may have been named after Dagon, an ancient pagan god of the sea. For his role in capturing Jerusalem Godfroi was offered the crown of th at newly Christianized city. He refused and the title of king went instead to his brother Baldwin (Baudoin) Bouillon. One of the most interesting aspects of Godfroi's arrival in Jerusalem is that it was known he was attended by a virtually anonymous group of obviously very powerful individuals. Forming a sort of shadowy conclave, they appear to have wielded more power than Godfroi himself. No names have been left in antiquity to attest as to the point of origin or families of these men, but they may have in cluded a mysterious man by the name of Peter the Hermit...from Amiens in France...Persistent historical rumors suggest that Peter the Hermit had formerly been a tutor to Godfroi de Bouillon - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed )"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"A cle arer understanding of the Templars and their intentions is afforded us when we discover what was going on in Burgundy and Champagne during the seizure of Jerusalem and the crowning of Baldwin Bouillon. According to Butler and Dafoe, this event was of secon dary importance compared to what was being conceived in Troyes, France, by Hugh the Count de Champagne. It was from this city (one of the most important cities in secret society history) that plans were orchestrated that would change the political and reli gious history of the world. According to these authors Hugh de Champagne, together with Andre de Montbard, and others, was conspiring to overthrow the same Roman Church that had, with his own family's military assistance, just established its dominion over Jerusalem. French - Jewish nobleman Hugues de Payens, together with eight other crusaders of Jewish origin, including Andre de Montbard, Geoffroi Bisol, and Geoffroi de Saint - Omer officially founded the Order of the Knights Templar in 1118. There is, howeve r, certain information that the order was actually founded four years earlier...In 1114, the bishop of Chartres mentioned ―La Milice du Christ\" in a letter, the name by which the order was originally known - Juri Lina ( Architects of Deception ) The picture th at was emerging was of a group of European noble families, descended from the Jewish lines of David and Aaron, who had escaped from Jerusalem shortly before, or possible even just after, the fall of the Temple...Some of the families involved were the Count s of Champagne, Lords of Gisors, Lords of Payen, Counts of Fontaine, Counts of Anjou, de Bouillon, St. Clairs of Roslin, Brienne, Joinville, Chaumont, St Clair de Gisor, St Clair de Neg and the Hapsburgs...By 1095, the members of the Rex Deus families grou p were almost certainly fully Christianized, yet each of them must have had at least one male member who held the traditional history of their high - born Jewish roots close to his heart - Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas ( The Second Messiah ) It is almost as if the agencies concerned in the Troyes Fraternity and the Cistercian movement were fully aware that there were direct connections between themselves and the Jews of old - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) In his definitive wor k, The Magical Mason, W. Wynn Westcott, the founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in England, traces the origins of the Freemasons back to the Essenes in Jerusalem; Pharisaic Jews, the practitioners of the most strict Judaism - Eustace Mullins ( Curse of Canaan ) ...whilst the Templar founders were in Jerusalem, Bernard of Clairvaux had been making his abbey into a resort for esoteric study. Rather strangely, for such a deeply Christian foundation, Bernard had acquired the skills of certain Jewish scholars who were ensconced within the abbey itself - ibid These men, Hugh de Champagne, Hugh de Payens and Andre de Montbard, together with a number of others whose faces will forever remain in the historical shadows, were planning to destroy once and for all the power of the established Church and to replace it with something far older and, to their way of thinking, more elevated - ibid"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"And so, given that this last statement is true, we must ask what kind of older and more elevated type of Christianity th ese Merovingian Crusader Templars had in mind. Their brother in arms, Godfroi, had mysteriously turned down the privilege of being the first king of Jerusalem. W as this because he too had designs on overthrowing the very power that had sent him on such a h oly quest? W as it because he and his Templar brethren ultimately knew that Jerusalem was to be theirs anyway, after their coup d'etat? Soon after this time, one of the most important figures in Christian history enters the scene. His name was Bernard de Cl airvaux. Bernard one of the main advocates for the Templars during good times and bad. He was also a Cistercian monk who set about reforming the order making it into the great power that it eventually became. This he did with the full assistance of the Bur gundian nobility. Two years later in 1115, so the story goes, Hugh, Count of Champagne offered a tract of land not far from Troyes for the foundation of a new Cistercian abbey. Bernard was only twenty - five years of age and had been a monk for just over two years and yet, against all the odds, he was chosen to be abbot of the new establishment, which he called Clairvaux - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) At heart, Bernard of Clairvaux was a believer in the old Roman and Celtic Churc h which had ruled its own affairs, quite immune from interference from the king or his vassal lords. This was the Burgundian and Merovingian way, and the Salt Line families appear never to have swayed from a belief in extremely old forms of Christianity - ibid Bernard was instrumental not only in the progress of the Cistercian order of France but also in the education and nomination of Pope Innocent II (real name Gregorio Papareschi) who would replace Pope Honorius II in Rome. In truth, the Merovingian elit es had influence on popes before Innocent's time. It is likely that Pope Urban II (1088), and Pope Gregory VII (1073), were reliant on Merovingian patronage. After all, it was Urban II who commissioned the First Crusade that suited the Templar plan no end. Interestingly, Bernard's choice was based on the fact that Innocent was a committed believer in the sanctity and importance of the Virgin Mary. Bernard himself was particularly enamored by King Solomon, and we cannot stress the significance of this enough . Did the Knights of the Temple of Solomon adopt their name because they admired this old world, Old Testament, figure more than Jesus Christ? Further evidence for Bernard's personal respect for a feminine aspect to the godhead comes from his virtual obses sion with a book of the Bible known as Solomon's Song of Songs. This is one of the strangest parts of the Jewish and Christian Old Testament, and at base owes little to Judaism in its present, orthodox sense. Solomon's Song of Songs represents a series of extremely beautiful, but also deeply erotic, verses primarily concerning a conversation between a bride and a bridegroom - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed )"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"Yes, that is the orthodox view of the content of the Song of Songs. But wh at of its Egyptian roots? W hat if this Song of Songs was composed by Akhenaton? After all, his lauded so - called \"Great Hymn to the Aton\" is believed by some to have inspired Ecclesiastes, the Psalms of David, and Proverbs of Solomon. The similarities betwe en the Hymn to the Aton and Psalm 104 are particularly striking. The writer of the latter was undoubtedly inspired by Akhenaton's composition. W e conclude that the Hymn of Aton was what Bernard was really inspired and obsessed by and not, as we are being l ed to believe, the biblical Song of Songs. De Clairvaux's role was vital to the advancement of the Knights Templar. His document, De Laude Novae Militae (\"In Praise of the New Knighthood \" ) , was a master work of propaganda in their favor. It was designed to bring them maximum support and favorable public recognition. The document was conceived by Hugh de Payens who desired to subtly conceal the true face of Templarism while giving the world an understanding as to what made the Templars different from other c hivalric orders, and a Templar different from other knights. Apparently, this piece of propaganda worked wonders for the order. In particular, the document stressed that the Templars were a fraternity of monks as well as soldiers. Thus in a wondrous and un ique manner they appear gentler than lambs, yet fiercer than lions. I do not know if it would be more appropriate to refer to them as monks or as soldiers, unless perhaps it would be better to recognize them as being both. Indeed they lack neither romantic meekness nor military might - Bernard de Clairvaux ( De Laude Novae Militae ) Indeed, a great deal of what has been written about the Templars has been commissioned by the so - called \"Troyes Fraternity\" that brought them and the Cistercian movement into exis tence in the first place. They have enjoyed excellent publicity because they have written their own story. The account we have of the founding of the Templars was written some time after the events it describes. Our only informant is an historian by the na me of Guillaume de Tyre. He did not pen his account until at least 1175, and probably much later, so he is writing three - quarters of a century after the events that took place in Jerusalem and immediately after its capture by the forces of Godfroi de Bouil lon. As to where Guillaume came by his original material, we have hardly a clue, and it is entirely possible that the whole account is propaganda created by the Troyes Fraternity Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) Once Innocent II was installed in Rome he enabled the Templar empire to expand without hindrance. They enjoyed more freedom and privilege. They were also masters of Jerusalem. Their kinsman Baldwin had been made king of the \"holy\" city.

Their supposed vow of poverty, of walking as Christ"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"and his disciples walked, was a pure sham. The wealth of the Templars was b eyond measure. There were eleven original members and they called themselves the ―Poor Knights of Solomon‘s Temple,‖ where they were first based - Juri Lina ( Architects of Deception ) In 1128, the first group of temple brothers returned home, where they met Pope Honorius II, and Bernard of Clairvaux...Bernard became their guardian and in time, he became a very rich man. He built and paid for 90 monasteries and 80 cathedrals - Juri Lina ( Architects of Deception ) In January 1162 Pope Alexander III issued a spe cial papal bull granting the Templars extraordinary powers...This papal bull strengthened the political power of the Order even more and the Grand Master is reputed to have told Henry II of England, 'You shall be king as long as you are just,' suggesting t hat he had the power to topple him from the throne - Michael Howard ( Occult Conspiracy ) The actual translation of that part of the Templar rule is: \"the keeping of goods in common.\" This is a far cry from an outright declaration of poverty. The intention s eems to have been that no one Templar knight might own anything personally, but rather, that everything material acquired by the Templars belonged to the order. This would allow the order to grow very wealthy, as in fact it did, without breaking the origin al established rules - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) Of particular interest are the years the Templars spent in Jerusalem with their King Baldwin I. For nine years after their seizure of the city (July 15 1099), the Templars bu sied themselves doing things that have never been clearly recorded or described. W hat is known is that they were not busy executing those duties for which they had ostensibly been founded. There is not a single other contemporary record that shows them eng aged in the very activity for which they had supposedly been formed and, as far as we know, they did not appoint any new members to their order until they returned to France around 1127.

W hat did they have to do with th e \"Christian\" Templars and nobility of France?

If the Merovingian elite were related in some way to the Atonists of old, then a return to Judea, Palestine, and nearby Egypt, would have been a highly significant ritual for all concerned. And would not their connection to the Atonist dynasty of Hyksos pharaohs also have taken care of the astronomical bills accrued during their crusading ventures? It certainly would. After all, no one has really established where the real Templar expense account came from. Thei r immense wealth enabled the Templars to virtually own kingdoms and countries and to have almost complete control over the political decisions that shape the world. It also gave them power to undermine and obliterate rivals who stood in their way, includin g popes and kings.

We are entitled to ask: \"From where did the financial impetus to even commence the Templar empire come from?\" The nine knights who attended the Troyes gathering of 1128 were, according to orthodox accounts, \"poor.\" In fact, this as reflected in the name chosen f or the order because they were the \"Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon.\" Nothing could be further from the truth, for even if the founder knights themselves were not of middle - ranking aristocratic stock...they had extremely rich backers, not the least of whom was the fabulously rich Hugh Count of Champagne.

The wife of Hugh de Payens, one of the Templar's head men, was of clan Sinclair. A key year for the order was 1139, when Pope Innocent II saw to it that the Templars were made independent of the d ominion of kings and emperors. He made them legally sacrosanct and answerable only to him. During the reign of Pope Innocent II, the Templars would be made responsible to no other authority than the pope himself. In other words, no civil or ecclesiastical court could touch the meanest hair on the grubbiest head of the lowliest page in the order - Alan Butler & Stephen Dafoe ( The Knights Templar Revealed ) The original Templar knights remained in Jerusalem until 1127 when most of them returned to Champagne.

Bernard of Clairvaux was thirty - eight years of age and was perhaps the most powerful m an in Christendom, with the possible exception of the pope himself - ibid The Templars were the first bankers of Europe. This occupation enabled them to control the economic destiny of the world from the eleventh century onward. In their capacity as the br okers for French princes, dukes, and kings, and for the Vatican, the Templars were able to decide the fate of any agency or individual who stood against them. As the symbolism of the great banks reveals, the Templars do indeed own the world. They have been actively using their financial muscle to buy politicians, statesmen, lawyers, judges, police chiefs, mayors, generals, intellectuals, city planners, and media icons, and to purvey all manner of addictive substances through their innumerable ale houses, ta verns, and inns, while at the same time they have poisoned humanity through their pharmaceutical monopolies, organized and operated by their brethren, the Knights of St. John Hospitaler.

Martin Luther‘s sixteenth - century Protestant Reformation was largely funded by the emerging merchant and banking classes of Germany who sought to wrest financial control from the Papacy. Jews moved into banking in medieval times because the Christians, due to a Biblical ban on usury, could not loan money at interest. This led to a so - called worldwide cabal of Jewish usurers, eventually culminating in the Rothschild dynasty - Devon Jackson ( Conspiranoia ) Given these facts, and given the new evidence coming forth concerning the true power and wealth of the Templars, it is inconceiva ble that the Templar order ceased to exist after Philip IV rose up against them in the fourteenth century. A cabal, at least 300 hundred years old, with as much insider information as these Templars commanded, would hardly have operated so incompetently as to allow themselves to be outwitted and taken by surprise by a single, obviously hostile, king with an axe to grind. Although history records that key Templars were arrested and tortured, it also records that virtually none of their considerable wealth wa s ever located by their supposed enemies. Experts now realize that the Templars knew all about the plans of their enemies and simply prepared for the worst by handing over their wealth to their brethren (the Knights of St. John Hospitaler, Knights of Malta , and Knights of Rhodes), and to other kindred secret societies. In short, the temple may have lost a brick or two, but remained standing just where it was.

This fact must be always borne in mind when studying the world's most powerful secret societies. From the same womb that bore the Templars came the Order of Sion (or Zion). This order hailed from the same Templar cities of Burgundy and Champagne. Undoubte dly, its heads were the same coterie of secret Culdeans, Jews, and Kabalists who had accompanied Godfroi and Baldwin to Jerusalem and guided their hands there. The elite members of the Order of Sion are believed to own over 10,000 castles in France alone. The earliest reports on the Order of Zion concern its creation in Alexandria Egypt by an adept calling himself Ormesius (or Ormus), who concerned himself with \"blending\" Egyptian paganism and Christianity. In 1070, Ormesius took his new order to Italy an d then, later, on to France. In France his order was headed by arch - crusader and knight, Godfroi de Bouillon. At this time the order was renamed \"Ordre de Sion.\" In 1188, the Order de Zion gained a new name, the Prieure de Sion and their own grand master J ean de Gisors. At the same time a second name - ―Ormus‖ was taken, which was used until 1306. According to the Freemasons, Ormus was an Egyptian magician - Juri Lina ( Architects of Deception )"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"After its creation, the Order of Sion maintained important cente rs at Mount Carmel in Palestine, at Calabria in Southern Italy, and in Burgundy, France. According to a twelfth century Papal Bull, one of the Order's main bastions was at Mount Zion in Jerusalem. After this mother abbey was overrun by the Saracens, many m embers of the Order of Zion accompanied King Louis back to France setting up new centers in Orleans. According to legend, in the year 1188, the Order of Zion, is purported to have broken off from their twin order, the Knights Templar. It is possible that t he Order of Sion was disbanded, or assimilated, at this time. It may simply have changed its name and obvious identity. W hether the Priory de Sion of more modern times is identical with this earlier order, is difficult to establish. It may well be. The fac t that the new order was registered and closely affiliated with Switzerland's most illustrious Freemasonic Order, Grand Lodge Alpina, certainly gives us food for thought. This Swiss Order is itself in command over the infamous P2 Lodge of Freemasons in Rom e. And P2 certainly exists. Scholars surmise that the Templar - Freemasonic order takes its name, Sion (pronounced sheeon ), from the first letters of the holy family of Egypt - S et, I sis, O siris and N ephthys. These four deities were sacred to the ancient Egy ptians as well as to those with ancestral ties to the land of Egypt. And this, together with the implications of the term \"Zion,\" gives us our connection to the Egyptian Cult of Aton. The Atonist Levites had occupied the Hyksos city of Zoan, or Zion , also known as Avaris - the real City of David. The word Zion comes from the Irish Zon that denoted the sun, as well as sun - worshippers. This proves that the Levites were dyed - in - the - flesh sun - worshippers. It is likely that the city of Avaris was first settled i n ancient times by the Phoenicians. The Phoenicians had settled at Thebes from the earliest times and since we understand the Phoenicians to be Aryans (Irish), as well as sun - worshippers, we are most receptive to the suggestion that they were the predynast ic founders of Avaris and of other Egyptian cities. Additionally, the syllable On (from Zion ) is Egyptian. It refers to the sun and was the name of the great city of the sun, Heliopolis. The priests of the temples of Ra and Aton at Heliopolis were major su pporters of Akhenaton and were the elite of the Atonist sun order. This is why their symbolism (of the sun, and of light) appears throughout the regalia and iconography of the royal families, as well as appearing on national coats - of - arms, heraldry, flags, medals, brand logos, and corporate emblems. It is this infamous Order of Zion that funds and controls the Freemasonic Order, Knights Templar, Bavarian Illuminati, and Grand Orient Lodges whose overlord, Duke d' Orleans of the Guise dynasty, was a prime m over instigating the French Revolution and ritual slaughter of the Bourbon monarch Louis XVI and his court.

The Cult of Aton's chiefs consid er themselves the true regents of this Earth. It is they who appoint the commonly obvious presidents, prime ministers, church potentates and lodge grand masters. The dominion of these minions is entirely dependent upon the will of their reclusive masters, the hierarchs whose word is law. As in any corporation, when lay - offs become inevitable, it is usually not top executives who \"get the sack.\" If a lodge or even an entire order begins to displease, it can be penalized or even eradicated. The many orders an d fraternities under the dominion of the Cult of Aton are merely means to ends. They are as significant as houses on a \"Monopoly\" board - game. They are expendable as are the operatives within them. Let us not forget that the hierarchs that we are studying are both ritualistic and superstitious. They are religious but not in any way that is understood by men and women of the world today. Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval sum up the situation quite well in their book Talisman : It has long been recognized that the ancient Egyptians did not have a ̳religion‘ - at least not in the sense that we understand the meaning of this word today...the fact remains that it cannot be found in the vocabulary of the ancient Egyptians. It simply does not exist. As the eminent Egyp tologist and philologist Alan H. Gardiner explains, ̳From the Egyptian point of view we may say that there is no such thing as ‖religion;‖ there was only ―heka,‖ the nearest English equivalent of which is magical power - Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval ( T alisman ) Disciples of these animistic magical principles (that are not negative or evil in themselves) tend to carry out their duties in a prescribed manner quite incomprehensible to most of us who have a different method of action. Moreover, in their magi cal lexicon sacrifice plays a very important role. The chiefs operate the world order as we would play a game of chess. On our board the king's movements are extremely limited and he can be sacrificed as easily as one of his pawns. If such a contingency ar ises, the game is considered lost. But if such a contingency arises on the world chess - board the \"game\" simply alters and continues. The Bourbon monarchs of France displayed their connections to Egypt by the very design and layout of their capital city, Pa ris. Researchers Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval have been astonished at the Egyptian symbolism incorporated into the major W estern cities and have confirmed that the secret fraternities were behind the choices made by the French kings and other royal dig nitaries. In their excellent book Talisman , they state that: For reasons and motives not yet too clear, the ceremonies, festivities and city monuments associated with the ̳sister‘ American and French Revolutions display Masonic ideas and imagery and...are he avily tinged with ̳Egyptian‘ connotations and symbols."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"Louis XVIII ruled for ten years. He was a Freemason. On his death in 1824 he was succeeded by his brother, the Court d‘Artois - also a Freemason - who took the name Charles X. Both monarchs showed a ma rked preference for ancient Egyptian symbolism in their public works and two projects of Charles X are of particular interest in this regard. The first involved transporting an intact ancient Egyptian obelisk to Paris. The second called for the commissioni ng of a gigantic painting in the Louvre. These authors may be perplexed at the reasons for this obsession with Egypt but they are not unaware that another tentacle of the French secret societies was known as the Nine Sisters' Lodge. American investigators are should be aware that one of this French order's most prestigious members was none other than Benjamin Franklin. Franklin was the most illustrious endorser and signer of the American Declaration of Independence . Additionally, one of the Order of Zion's main bases in France is in the province of Lorraine. The symbol for the province, and the dukes, of Lorraine is literally the \"double cross.\" This symbol was used by the so - called French \"Underground,\" and is seen on the Exxon oil corporation of America to day. Exxon is known as \"Esso\" (from Essa) in England. An \"Exxon\" is, like a Page, an official of a royal court and acts as a messenger or spokesperson for royalty . The word Sion can also be spelled Xion (since Si in Greek is Xi ). This is similar to Exxon . Numerologically, the letters S - I - O - N are 1965. These numbers, by way of transposition and Gematria, give the word rose (9615). The word and symbol of the rose have often been used as a cryptic cover for the Cult of Aton and their many secret society servan ts, for instance, the Rosicrucians ( L'Ordre de la Rose - Croix ). W e still use the term \"double - crossed\" today when we suffer being undermined, deceived, or defrauded. Rose gardens exist near major parliament buildings and government offices.

The word david was a title given to military commanders. In other words, there was not one \"David,\" but many. The word had a similar meaning to \"General\" \"Field Marshal,\" or \"Commander.\" Another related word is divide, that obviously implies division . Indeed, this was something that Akhenaten excelled at. He was in truth a great \"Divider,\" and we can speculate that this might have been a very apt moniker for him. The word and concept was a dopted by Freemasons and given a geometric connotation. After all, the masons value both the compass and the rule that are used for dividing and measuring.

Light, Magic, and Masonry ...why is the term \"light\" so frequently used a nd preferred throughout the Christian scriptures, to denote the spiritual condition of man?

Hence light and knowledge are now synonymous tems - Kersey Graves ( Bible of Bibles, 1863 AD) Light As Thought What light is to the outer physical world, intellect is to the inner world of consciousn ess - Arthur Schopenhauer Not many of us realize that there are two kinds of thinking that operate simultaneously. There is thinking with the brain and thinking with the mind. The mind and the brain are not the same thing. The latter is basically an organi c machine programmed by our worldly experiences through this lifetime. The former is an phylogenetic inheritance, an archive containing the thought impressions of all those men and women who have lived before us and whose myriad experiences have been recor ded in the \"Akashic Record,\" the \"Ancestral Brain\" or, in psychological parlance, the \"Collective Unconscious.\" Thinking with the mind might turn out to be quite a delusion. It might turn out that human beings think for the mind rather than with it. Contra ry to what we falsely believe, we do not come into this world \"innocent.\" Innocence, as W illiam Blake knew, is merely our state of mind when introduced to the world's myriad phenomena for the first time. To the young brain everything inside and out seems n ew, fresh, exciting, and incomprehensible. Originally, before we are taught otherwise, we do not even try to think about what happens to us or about what we see and experience. W e simply experience. And apparently, it is enough to do so, at least for most young people. As we age, however, we gain experience and innocence eventually flees never to return. It vanishes when we begin contemplating our experiences, when a mind begins contemplating itself, or rather what it imagines to be itself. And painful expe riences seem to compel men to think on the meaning of their lives. As Schopenhauer wrote: \"W ithout pain, life is meaningless.\" As we grow, we certainly continue to crave the freshness and spontaneity we once knew. However, we fail to realize that it is our own minds, our"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"consciousness , that needs to be new and fresh every day and not our various experiences. The mind that is fragmented, narrow, infirm, narcissistic, and toxic can hardly be expected to function in a healthy, spontaneous manner, or to know an ything as a certainty. As a toxic mind decays it loses its mutability and ceases to function holistically. It continues to have experiences and relationships, but few are deep and truly meaningful. A calcified mind is content to take orders and be led. It is content to cluster with minds of its own sordid kind. It loathes independence and aloneness. It despises darkness, silence, and inwardness. It despises anyone that is inward, quiet, and \"dark.\" It does not realize that, sooner or later, it will have to inherit the very shadows it has cast by way of its shallow, acquisitive, hyperfocused patterns of thought. The correlation of consciousness with masculinity culminates in the development of science, as an attempt by the masculine spirit to emancipate itsel f from the power of the unconscious...We call this path \"ascent\" because we experience consciousness and the world of light as being \"above\" us and unconscious and darkness \"below\" still under the spell of the primitive symbolism which associates the uprig ht posture of the human figure with the development of the head and the rest of the \"higher\" centers of consciousness - Erich Neumann ( The Origin and Evolution of Consciousness ) ...thinking which does not start from and continue in close relation to its foun dations in the physical universe must lead to falsity - Alvin Boyd Kuhn Light, Sight, and Seeing A shadow is just the part of Her that His light can‘t banish or erase - Michael Tsarion Living in the world involves sensing the world. The most important sens e is that of sight. Through sight we receive the vast majority of our knowledge about the world and about reality. Seeing is achieved by way of the human eye. The eye, and the act of seeing, is dependent upon light that transmits or conducts a good portion of the world's contents to the brain. Light is, as they say, knowledge .

This su btle optical experience may be compared to a miniature orgasm small enough to not be noticed consciously but strong enough to be very stimulating and entrancing to the subconscious part of us . Over time, the transmittance of information via the light creates deep impressions on the brain and mind. Again, this has phallic connotations. Because of the inherent eroticism of the light we literally become addicted to light and the thinking to which it gives birth. Thought is the original addiction and as addicts we do not realize how strongly held and dependent we have become upon thought and upon light.

In his book The Symbolism of Freemasonry , Mackey added an entire chapter on light a nd what it means to a Mason. He wrote on the subject thusly: ...here again we have in Masonry that old and often - repeated allusion to sun - worship, which has already been seen in the officers of a lodge, and in the point within a circle. And as the circumambu lation is made around the lodge, just as the sun was supposed to move around the earth, we are brought back to the original symbolism with which we commenced — that the lodge is a symbol of the world.

It begins, however, with the communication of LIGHT, which, although but a preparation for the development of the mysteries which a re to follow, must be considered as one of the most important symbols in the whole science of masonic symbolism. Light was, in accordance with this old religious sentiment, the great object of attainment in all the ancient religious Mysteries. It was there , as it is now, in Masonry, made the symbol of truth and knowledge. This was always its ancient symbolism, and we must never lose sight of this emblematic meaning, when we are considering the nature and signification of masonic light.

He was speaking about the strange antinomy that apparently exists between idea and reality, appearance and fact, deception and truth, darkness and light. This antinomy wa s a mystery that also perplexed the Oriental mystics who rendered the problem in their Yin Yang symbol, known as the \"Eyes of the Dragon.\" This symbol expressed a similar concept as the two eyes of the Egyptian god Ra. The masons also embodied the dichotom y in their checker board designs. For the masons the black squares represent human ignorance, while the white squares represent knowledge.

The Kabalists maintained that Lucifer fell from heaven like a zigzagging lightening flash. Light, they believed, descended downwards through ten major centers known as Sephiroth (spheres). After its descent, the light, in a relatively dimini shed form, came to rest in the realm known by Kabalists as \"Malkuth\" - the Physical Plane. The light that men normally perceive in the world outside, and that illumines thought inwardly, is of this diminished variety. It has the power though to lead the in itiated neophyte to higher grades and frequencies. Once the initiate has reached the highest level, known as \"Kether,\" he is considered \"Enlightened\" and \"All Knowing.\" By following the light and being in the light he has had to face his own darkness and d irt. He has had to cleanse himself of impurity and overcome imperfection. He has to bathe in the light, as it were, to eradicate ignorance. As a \"Son of the Light\" he believes everything that is erroneous, imperfect, and passive, to be the darkness.

In their reckoning of reality, men are separated into groups of the ignorant and the knowledgeable. The ever - changing entity (the human ego) is dependant upon the movement of time. It is the human ego that ope rates in time and that is dependent upon time. Since the ego projects itself into the future and expects that its perfection exists tomorrow \"sometime\" it becomes caught in a paradox. This is because tomorrow does not exist. It is merely a projection of th e ego. The ego believes in progress and commits itself to the dream of tomorrow. Nevertheless, the reality is that for every step the ego takes toward this phantom perfection the more its imperfection is affirmed. Its quest is born from a fallacy and its g oal is therefore unachievable. The place in which the perfection is said to be does not even exist. it is a figment of the mind that conceives it. The ego cannot find a way out of this paradox and it exists like a spider caught in its own web. The ambient power and ego - less intelligence of nature threatens the ego deeply. The ego's power is finite while the universe's energy is infinite. The ego dies while nature is eternal. The Druids instructed men to revere this infinite power source and to obey the ordi nances of nature the great sustainer, teacher, and healer. The Luciferians teach men to lust for scientific understanding. They sharpen the left hemisphere of the brain and seek to control and shape nature i nto whatever form the ego of man deems right for its own sanity and security.

To close the gap men conform to similar ideas. They conform and become victims of consensus trance. This regrettable trait is exploited by those who seek to enslave human beings. These concepts, pertaining to light, god, and power, are so alien to us because we have, in our present solar - centric, technocratic milieu, successfully divided reality into a myriad conflicting parts and have instigated unsustainable hierarchies that bear no resemblance to the holarchic structure of nature.

Perhaps, in persisting with our vain ardor to repair what is no t broken and \"improve\" upon perfection we have finally lost our vision of the inherent, ambient order and beauty all around us that is not \"plugged - in,\" wasteful, or finite, and that operates flawlessly without mind, thought, ego, or human consciousness.

The Work of Kersey Graves Introduction A religion which sedulously opposes its own improvement can do nothing essential toward improving anything else...On the contrary, it must check the growth of everything it touches with its palsied hands - Ker sey Graves Throughout our work we have attempted to discover where the various Judeo - Christian traditions originally came from. Seeking these origins is, in our opinion, of vital importance for it yields invaluable information about the present sorry human condition. However, the question of origins must remain secondary to the more vital question concerning the validity of the myriad tenets of religion (specifically of Judeo - Christianity). The question of primary importance concerns whether or not the vari ous religious tenets, customs, proclamations, precepts, laws, and traditions have any rational value. Do they contribute to humanity's healthy development or do they restrain and inhibit such progress? Do they contribute to the spiritual wealth of nations and peoples, or are they a corrupting influence? Do they explain the mysteries of microcosm and macrocosm, or do they prevent needed understanding? Do Christian tenets breed love of virtue and truth, as great philosophy should, or do they subvert the natu ral intelligence of human beings, thereby leading to greater mental arrestation and moral delinquency? Do they provide insight for a philosophically - minded seeker, of naturally moral men, or do they satiate the sullied palates of fools, villains, and sadis ts?

Moody (American Clergyman) By far the greater part of those who embraced the Christian religion in this its infancy being men of mean extraction and wholly illiterate, it could not otherwise happen but that a great scarcity sho uld be experienced in the churches of persons possessing the qualifications requisite for initiating the ignorance and communicating instruction to them with a due degree of readiness and skill - Johann Lorenz von Mosheim (17th century German church histor ian)"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"Certainly, we understand Judeo - Christianity to be antique, and we now have a fair idea as to where it originated. W hat we must address is its overall significance. That which served mankind yesterday may be of little use today. That which has inhibite d man's natural evolution is of even less value. That which has poisoned and drugged humanity in the past must not be allowed to so affect incoming souls who must be allowed to inherit a sane and safe world, one in which they can know truth directly, and i n which they can know themselves, as the great oracles of old directed. In the course of our expose we intend to clearly show how the Universal Intelligence (or God Force) works with, or communicates through, the consciousness of human beings. Indeed, it i s our contention that the force that is known as God, works through, or is the human reason. The reason is the Creator's true revelation to man. Therefore, it follows that the nature of any man's character - as well as his virtue - depends on the manner in which he utilizes reason. It is for man to perfect, by use, the faculty that makes living an enriching and meaningful experience. To understand and apply religious tenets and principles presupposes good moral intention and a mind already self - imbued with sanctity. Only a rational mind can understand the supposed communications of God, should God exist. Reason is, therefore, infinitely superior to revelation. So, since reason is greater than revelation, we can see how damaging and sinister it is when we ar e told by clerics to never question the scriptures or ask whether the \"infallible\" words of god make rational sense. The priests and pastors are quite content to have us do what Saint Augustine did and believe the scriptures \"because they are absurd.\" Mill ions of people have shown themselves more than capable of this. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent....Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this w orld? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen - (I Corinthians 1:10 & 27, 28) If human reason is the \"God\" within then it logically follows that anything that confounds or subverts the rationality of man must be unspiritual and base. The irrational and unsoun d must be exposed, routed out and cast aside. If it remains, the rational faculty will be under assault and perpetual threat of infection and infirmity. A cold look at the mess of humanity today furnishes proof enough of this point.

Regardless of the difficulties, however, the exposure of lies and deception and of the irrational must continue. The splendid gardens of the human reason and imagination must be kept clean of the weeds of superstition and error. A lie concerning the world or the divine is a lie that must be exposed by reason - a reason that is sharp and decisive. The word sanity comes from the same root as the word sanitize and so, like bodily health, the mind must also be hygienic in order to operate excellently. Unfortunately, most minds are anything but hygienic. Our environment is saturated with corrupting and contaminating agents that literally intoxicate the mind and the emotions. Man is intoxicated, and we believe that it is his religious beliefs are the main cause of his delirium. The scientific mind is likewise intoxicated, since science has become a new religion with as many fallacies and contradictions as the religion's of antiquity. The reason exalts man. Man's beliefs and o pinions, understanding and knowledge, are based upon the operation of reason. The right use of reason leads us toward the truth of ourselves. It allows us to glean a meaning for existence and for our role in the world. The reason can also operate to reveal the lies that proliferate around us. The healthy reason works defensively in the presence of falsehood. It follows that anything that confounds reason should be considered evil . In our opinion, the Judeo - Christian creed, as presented and codified by the c hurches, is such an evil.

Does this mean that god is dependant on food and water, that he d epends on light to see and air to breathe, or that he is subservient to the elements, or that he needs a mate, etc? If we spontaneously reply \"no\" to these questions, then we confirm that god must not closely resemble man as Genesis assures us. So, we have a contradiction...one of many. God either resembles man in form and character, or he does not? W hich is it. And if god possesses those physical, emotional, and mental traits that are seen in men, then are we not to assume the accuracy of the earlier Sumeria n texts that insists that god walked physically among men? And if these early pagan texts are accurate in that regard, what else do they contain that is true? Man is made in God's image. So says Genesis. Then why were neither Adam or Eve made immortal like God? If Adam was made in God's own image, why do Jews and Christians not believe man to be able to become godlike? W e are told by the religions that man has two natures, good and evil.

He became that way after the disobedience of Eve in the Garden. W hy would God create something born in his image and then deny him some aspect of knowledge and then even banish him from paradise after it had been received? W e must also ask why God would condemn his creations for something that was not a conscious transgression? W hy the tests imposed on those who must already be innocent in nature? God promised Noah after the Flood that he would never visit the world with like calamity again...but there have been innumerable devastations unleashed on earth, that taken together would rival and even surpass the horror and death - t oll of a prehistoric aeon. Does it not seem strange that the God who promised to take care of all his people and never bring another deluge would be so conspicuously absent during all the subsequent horrors of history? Then we are told that the parents sin ned, only after they fell under the influence of the evil one, Satan. So we ask, why would God allow his newly created beings to be in the proximity of this “evil one?” Who created the serpent? If a being such as \"Satan\" was known to exist, why was the ang el with the fiery sword meant to protect the garden of Eden not placed there sooner. What good was it to place such an angel of protection at Eden's gates after the damage had been done, and after Adam and Eve had already fallen from paradise? And how did Satan, if he existed, come to know evil himself? Must not evil have already existed? Certainly, evil must have been in existence, even as a potential, before Satan chose it as a means to an end. Or does this kind of logic not apply to scripture? Why would God himself know evil, before man was even created, unless God had already brought evil into the world? In Isaiah 45:7, God says \"I create evil.\" In Amos 3:6, Amos is asked \"Shall there be evil in a city and"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"the Lord hath not done it.\" And in Jeremiah 18:1 1, we read: \"I frame evil against you.\" Why, as we read in the Book of Job, would God give Satan, a being that cannot be trusted, the right to test Job? W hy would God not already know whether Job was a true servant or not. Is there a limit to the omniprese nce of Jehovah? And was there not a more reliable agent to send? W hy does God, who has thousands of angels, arch - angels, cherubim, seraphim, prophets and sages at his disposal, employ the \"father of lies,\" the great enemy of God and Mankind to go tempt and torture Job? Why did God command Abraham to sacrifice his own son upon a pagan altar. And if this was some kind of test, why did god not already know whether Abraham was made of the right stuff to carry out his word? One cannot also conceive of the reason for the existence of any being, like Satan, who has no good in him at all. W hat would be the point of creating such as being, or in sending him to test those who themselves must be morally pure? And if there is a problem with evil spreading all over the w orld, then why does God not just destroy or annihilate Satan from the Creation? He appears to have annihilated everything else, and appears to exact revenge upon every misdeed, even upon those who could not be consciously culpable. W hy not just get rid of the source of the problem and have a sinless, peaceful, loving Creation? In the New Testament we find Jesus undergoing temptation from Satan. How and why would this occur. If Christ was perfect from the start, and was the true, holy son of god, then why wo uld he endure mundane tests of any kind, that are reserved for those on the path of enlightenment? Moreover, Christ is the \"Alpha and Omega\" the beginning and the end, the greatest in all Creation. So why does the Devil tempt him with dominion over the \"ki ngdoms\" of the world. As the most powerful being Christ could have all these if he desired and would not need to be \"given\" them after he bowed to Satan. If Satan could even have the ability to aspire toward supreme Godhead, and if there are hierarchies of angels, etc. then perhaps God can indeed be surpassed? W hat are we to make of this?

Of the many strategies, employed by the clergy to explain the gross errata, there is one of especial perfidy and importance. It is - reliance on testimony of spurious historians who most likely never actually existed. This is not as incredible a strategy as we may first believe, and it has certainly proved itself sufficient. It has served to cover the many inconsistencies that compromise the professed accuracy and legitimacy of the Jewish and Christian scriptures. Since the scriptures themselves are of spurious origin, it is but one duplicit ous step to create fictitious experts, commentators, authorities and clerics to ostensibly \"explain\" corrupt texts that must either be accounted for or cast aside forever. Our amazement is lessened when we understand just how easy it is to fake, forge, and falsely authenticate. It is not in the art world alone that we find the artifice of the forger and plagiarizer. The greatest examples of this kind of criminality are to be found in ecclesiastical circles. The only difference is that the experts in the art world are truly ignorant of their errors in judgment, whereas the experts in the latter case are the culprits in need of exposure. The forger who destroys the original from which he has worked is less likely to be found out. His crime can possibly, in pra ctice as well as in theory, live forever.

After this, council after council was called to vote in or vote out some of the books adopted by previous councils, and to settle some important church dogmas. The first council voted the Acts of the Apostles and Revelations out of the Bible...but the second council, which met in 363 voted th em in again. Another council, which met in 406, voted them, with several other books, out of the Bible again. And thus were books and dogmas voted in and voted out of \"the infallible and inspired word of god,\" and altered and corrected, time after time and century after century, by twenty - four different councils, composed by bigoted bishops and clergymen, so quarrelsome and belligerent that they resorted to fisticuffs fighting in several of the councils - ibid The version of the Old Testament made under Pto lemy Philadelphus, 287 BC, - the most reliable version extant - the Bishop Usher pronounces a spurious copy, full of interpolations, additions, and alterations.

Dr. Bentley admits that the best copy of the New Testament contains hundreds of irreparable omissions, errors, and mistakes. The Rev.

Such an assumption will cause the downfall, sooner or later, of any religious body which persists in propagating the error. Religious institutions, like all other institutions, are subject to the laws of growth and decay.

Having found a great many absurdities in the Bible which he could not reconcile with reason and sense, and hence discoverin g he must either give up his Bible or his reason, he chose the latter alternative, and declared in his \"Book of Sermons\" - \"I believe things in the Bible because they are absurd. I believe them because they are impossible,\" as glaring an absurdity as was e ver issued from human lips. Such a desperate expedient to save his Bible and creed from going overboard shows that they had demoralized his mind, and made a complete wreck of his reason Naturally, the rational person cannot believe an absurdity. However, t he unsane person has no problem at all in doing so. W e must understand how easy it is for the psychologically insecure, existentially vagrant individual to distort the world into a form which suits his own vision and mentality. The toxic mind not only sees a toxic world, it creates one. It is a disturbed and insecure mind which requires a god to rely upon. The mind that cannot feel its own empowerment and that has no sense of Self , is able to center its belief on a dubious, unrealistic, invisible power, esse ntially greater, and in most cases, external , to itself. This person with this kind of mental disease will then cleave to the company of other people of the same persuasion. These minds will assume their own \"Consenus - Trance\" and will follow their psychica lly projected \"holographic\" god wherever it seems to lead them. If and when the higher centers of logic demand a rational explanation for such antihuman actions and beliefs, the irrational person forcibly quells the remonstrations, repressing all dissent b eneath an inflexible and morbidly rigid non - negotiable set of equally irrational pseudo - arguments. This kind of behavior, in turn, fosters great unconscious unrest that, in its own turn, spurs the host to yet further dangerous identification with the suppo sed source of his peace and salvation. Regardless of what horrors occur on the external stage, and regardless of what angst is felt within, there is little chance of breaking the spell, or the hex. Once man venerates an authority and wisdom - source outside of himself, he is condemned to live estranged from the true source of wisdom that exists within his own temple. The man so divided from his own sanctity is a plague upon the world, a curse to everyone and everything he encounters. By faith ye are saved, and not of yourselves, it is the gift of God - Paul (Ephesians 2:8) Many World Bibles More than twenty sacred books have been found in various countries, which, if not in all cases denominated Bibles, have at least been venerated and used as such, and, proper ly speaking, are Bibles...All of these Bibles possess some common characteristics."},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":" All of them claim to be Inspired All were claimed to be an embodiment of wisdom and knowledge far transcending the ordinary attainments of man All were penned by in spired men, who were shielded from the possibility of erring while writing them Each Bible is a finality in religious knowledge Each one is an authority from which there is no appeal It is a sin to question or doubt the truth of any of them, or to suggest the possibility of their containing errors Some of them were written by god, some by angels, and others by inspired men Each one points out the only safe and certain road to heaven He who is a disbeliever in any one of these holy books is an infidel Each one is to effect the salvation of the whole human race Paul on the Bible - less Gentiles In an astounding passage in his Epistles to the Romans, Paul admits that men can have morality and ethics without the need of any Bible. He says: The Gentiles, who have not the Bible, do by nature the things contained in the Bible One can only wonder why we have not heard more debate about this passage. And if Paul (the supposed author) really meant this, we have a great deal to debate. This passage is letting us know that one does not necessarily need the Bible to be moral, a great contradiction to what has been told by the clergy who set forth the Bible as man's only call to morality and salvation. There is another passage containing the same strange message from Paul: The invisible things of God are clearly seen and understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead - (Rom 1:20) So here we are to understand nature to be a teacher of the ways of god and not the Bible. The very e ssence of god, we are being told, can be discerned through the physical and natural world.

And, in same vein, we find Jesus hi mself saying: Know ye not of yourselves what is right? \"Authorized\" Does Not Mean \"Authentic\" Anyone who is familiar with the elements of the higher criticism knows that there are two stories of the Creation and the Fall of Man in the Book of Genesis. The first, or Priestly Account, was written in the fifth century BC, and extends through the beginning of Genesis through verse 3 of chapter 2. The second, or Jehovistic Account, begins with verse 4 of chapter 2, and extends through the third chapter. This ver sion of"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"the story was written in the eighth century BC. It is interesting to note the second narrative is about three - hundred years older than the first. In the Priestly Version: The earth emerges from the waters. it is saturated with moisture In the Jehov istic Version: The world is at first a dry plain. There was no vegetation, because \"the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth.\" In the Priestly Version: Birds and beasts are created before man. In the Jehovistic Version: All fowls of the air ar e made of the ground. In the Priestly Version: Man is created in the image of God. In the Jehovistic Version: Man is made out of the dust of the ground. It is only after eating of the forbidden fruit that god said: \"Behold, the man is become as one of us.\" In the Priestly Version: Man is made Lord of the whole earth. In the Jehovistic Version: Man is merely placed in the garden to dress it and keep it. In the Priestly Version: Man and woman are created together, as the closing and completing work of the who le creation. In the Jehovistic Version: Man is created first, then beasts and birds are, which are named by man. Finally, woman is made out of a the man. Orthodox Christians claim that both of these stories must be believed, even though they contradict eac h other at numerous points - John G. Jackson ( Pagan Origins of the Christ Myth ) The Wrath of Jehovah Jehovah, who of all the good gods adored by men was certainly the most jealous, the most vain, the most ferocious, the most unjust, the most bloodthirsty, the most despotic, and the most hostile to human dignity and liberty - Jehovah had just created Adam and Eve, to satisfy we know not what caprice; no doubt to while away his time, which must weigh heavy on his hands in his eternal egoistic solitude, or that he might have some new slaves. He generously placed at their disposal the whole earth, with all its fruits and animals, and set but a single limit to this complete enjoyment. He expressly forbade them from touching the fruit of the tree of knowledge. He wi shed, therefore, that man, destitute of all understanding of himself, should remain an eternal beast, ever on all - fours before the eternal God, his creator and his master. But here steps in Satan, the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipato r of worlds. He makes man ashamed of his bestial ignorance and obedience; he emancipates him, stamps upon his brow the seal of liberty and humanity, in urging him to disobey and eat of the fruit of knowledge - Mikhail Bakunin ( God and the State ) Then, reme mbering that he was not only a God of vengeance and wrath, but also a God of love, after having tormented the existence of a few milliards of poor human beings and condemned them to an eternal hell, he took pity on the rest, and, to save them and reconcile his eternal and divine love with his eternal and divine anger, always greedy for victims and blood, he sent into the world, as an expiatory victim, his only son, that he might be killed by men.

In the meantime, to console us, God, ever just, ever good, hands over the earth to the government of the Napoleon Thirds, of the William Firsts, of the Ferdinands of Austria, and of the Alexanders of all th e Russias...Such are the absurd tales that are told and the monstrous doctrines that are taught, in the full light of the nineteenth century, in all the public schools of Europe, at the express command of the government. They call this civilizing the people! Is it not plain that all these governments are systematic poisoners, interested stupefies of the masses? - Mikhail Bakunin ( God and the State ) Creation From Nothing The first text in the Bible is evidently an error. \"In the beginning God created the heave ns and the earth. (Gen 1)... The assumption involves two impossibilities. First, a creation could not take place without something to create from: \"Ex nihilo nihil fit\" - \"out of nothing nothing can come.\" - Graves God's Home Before the Creation If God \"cre ated the heavens\" (Gen 1) and heaven is his \"dwelling place\" (see 1 Kings 8:30), then where did he dwell before the heavens were made? Creation of the Light God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day. Yet he d id not make the light - producing objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth day. As we are told God created the light (Gen 1:3), the conclusion is forced upon us, that, prior to that period, he had spent eternity in darkness...\"God saw the light that i t was good\" (Gen 1:4). Hence we must infer that God had just got his eyes open, and that he had never before discovered that light is good. Of course it was good to be delivered from eternal darkness. Dividing Light From Darkness \"And God divided the ligh t from the darkness\" (Gen 1:4). Hence, previous to that period, they must have been mixed together. Philosophy teaches that light and darkness never can be separated any more than heat and cold, as one is only a different degree of the other. Birth of the Earth The Bible teaches that the earth came into existence three days before the sun, but science teaches us that the earth is a child or offshoot of the sun. \"And the earth was without form, and void\" says Genesis 1:2. But we wonder how it can be an earth at all then given the usual and rational meaning of the"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"word void. How can an empty nothing be a something with a name? The Bible is off to a great start. Vegetables Before Animals According to the Bible, the vegetable kingdom was created before the anima l; but the learned geologist Hitchcock, although a Christian by profession, in his \"Elements of Geology\" says \"An examination of the rocks shows us that animals were created as early as vegetables' (and he might have said much earlier). And yet the Bible s ays vegetables were created on the third day, and animals on the fifth day. (See Genesis 1) Creating the Sun and Moon In the Bible we are told by the author that Jehovah created \"mornings\" and \"evenings\" before he created the sun. Is this another miracle, o r just the product of the reasoning and scientific knowledge of the authors of this garbled travesty, composing centuries later, during the Dark Ages, after Christianity had already come into existence to plague the world? The Bible tells us that \"God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and god set them in the firmament to give light to the earth (Gen 1:16 - 17). That is, he made two round balls, and then stuck them into holes scooped out of the fi rmament for the purpose. This seems to be the idea. Here is disclosed the most egregious ignorance of astronomy. Think of that stupendous solar luminary, as much larger than this pygmy planet as a man is larger than a mouse, being hung up or stuck up abov e us for our sole accommodation. How sublimely ridiculous! The Lord's Strange Creation Timetable The Bible represents the great world - builder, the almighty architect, as spending five days in plodding and toiling at his little mole - hill of ours before he g ot it finished...and then made such a bad job of it that he repented for having undertaken it...But when he came to make the countless worlds, the vast suns, and systems of suns...these were all made in a few hours. \"And he made the stars also.\" God Gets D og Tired According to the Bible, God became so tired in the business of world - making that he had to take a rest of a whole day...but geology and philosophy both teach that creation never was begun, and never will be finished, but is going on all the time. More Insanity in the Making Due to the controversy over the idea of a six - day creation, Biblical authorities came forth with a seemingly clever explanation. W ithout precedence they declared that a Biblical \"day\" was really a period of a thousand years. Thi s"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"seemed the right amount of time to cover the glitch in understanding. A hundred years might sound too short a time, and a million years was certainly too long in their minds. So, with no more ado, a Biblical \"day\" became a thousand years. Naturally, by t he same logic a Biblical week could then be any amount of millennia, and a Biblical year could be any amount of aeons. All this bunk, when it would have been so simple to just have been given the actual length of time in the first place. But of course, we know that this was the problem. The amount of time to create the creation had to be left vague, since there was no such creation as is stipulated in the Bible. The creation, as mentioned in the Bible, is a creation of imagination for the imagination. There is not a shred of fact in it. ... we are told that a day in the Bible means a thousand years. Then, as the Sabbath day constitutes one of the days spoken of in the Bible, and was provided as a day of rest, Christians and the Bible believers should rest a t housand years at a time; and as God rested a whole day (a thousand years), he must have been as tired of resting as he was of world - making. Which Came First? The Bible teaches that whales, fish, and birds were made on the same day; but geology assures us t hat fish came into being long before fowl...The Bible teaches that beasts and creeping things were all made on the fifth day of creation; but geology tells us that reptiles and creeping things crawled upon the earth millions of years before beasts came int o existence. Creation of Eve According to the Bible, a serious blunder was made by Jehovah in the work of creation, by exhausting all the materials in the process of world - making and man - making, so that nothing was left to make a \"helpmeet\" for Adam; and t his blunder caused the necessity of robbing Adam of one of his ribs...But common sense teaches us that a small crooked bone but a few ounces in weight could not furnish half the material needed to constitute a woman. The Parsees , with a little more show o f sense, tell us that the rib was used merely as a back - bone, around which the woman was constructed. In the first chapter of Genesis we are told that Adam and Eve are created together, at the same time, whereas in the second Chapter Eve is created after A dam. (Perhaps this was an editing error). Adam's Free Time As the Bible teaches that Adam named all the beasts, animals, and birds, it must have occupied a great number of years for the Lord God of Moses to have caught and taken the several hundred thousan d species to Adam to receive names in all the three - thousand languages, and then convey them back to their respective climates. The question naturally arises, Why should Adam give them names...when there was nobody"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"present to hear it and be benefited by it ? And nobody could have remembered half the names had they been present. No, no one could have remembered the billions of animal names, and we can assume that Adam could not have remembered all the names he came up with for all the world's animals. Perhaps he wrote them down with pen and ink provided by the Lord. Perhaps, he was literate enough to read and write as well as name animals. One thing is for certain, Adam must have had a lot of free time to make this task his priority. Two Creations There are tw o Creation stories in the first book of the Bible. One can be found in Genesis Chapter 1, and the other in Chapter 2. In the first Chapter we read that the animals are created before Adam, and in the second Chapter, they are created afterwards. This is a m ajor contradiction in the very same book, just lines away from each other. If this is the level of accuracy in the Bible, we are in trouble from the start. But then we encounter yet another contradiction. In chapter one we read that the earth is created se veral days before the firmament (heaven), whereas in the second Chapter of Genesis we read that earth and heaven are created on the same day. Reason for Adam's Creation Again, the account is contradictory. Genesis 1 says that Adam was created in gods image , but in Chapter 2 he was made to \"till the ground\" for there was no one to carry out this function. Pity god did not create an already tilled ground when he fashioned the earth. In the first story, Graves notes that man appears to be godlike, and therefor e has dominion over the whole earth, whilst in the second chapter he is now a humble servant made to labor in the gardens of the Lord. Note : This contradiction is also found between the various world accounts of man's creation. In the book Atlantis, Alien Visitation and Genetic Manipulation, we consider these contradictory accounts and highlight the alternative story of Adam and Eve and their supposed disobedience and \"Fall.\" W e explore the stories that were left out of the bible, in which the Tree was guar ded to prevent man eating of the forbidden fruit that would make him into a god, and in which we are given a very different portrayal of the serpent than the one provided in the Bible. "},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"Tree of Life There were two trees in the garden. They are central char acters in the primal drama and yet we are told so little about them. One has been referred to as the \"Tree of Life\" and the other as the \"Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil.\" These attributions are not explained and we are left to imagine what these tr ees really are and why they were put, as distractions, before the innocent pair whom god had filled with desire to sin. However, when we do our homework we discover that the Tree was a seminal creation image employed first by the Gaelic Magi in Ireland. Fr om Ireland the symbol of the W orld Tree was transported to the Teutons and the Norsemen, and from there to other locales. The Tree was a symbol of organic creativity, of the movement and mystery of nature. It was a symbol which stylized the descent of crea tive energy from the supernal realms to the physical. The W orld Tree was the reverse of the physical tree. Instead of its life - force coming from the ground upward, the W orld Tree's vital force descended from on high downward. There were 22 branches on the Tree of Life, though the life - force traveled usually through 9 or 10 main centres or spheres. It was such a known and important leitmotif within the Gnostic and Hermetic Traditions of old, that it turned up in the Book of Genesis which, for all its contort ions and unnecessary embellishments, is a replica of the Egyptian (and Irish) Creation Myths. That little is said of the Tree, except that it is an object of desire and forbidden intent, tells us that little was known of it by the Bible authors who appear to not be personally privy to the depth of the original canon that they were plagiarizing. W herever else the Tree story appears in the world, it is always in the keeping of envious gods who are afraid that its secrets may be known to the angels and human c reatures. In all these legends the serpent is the guardian of the tree, set there by god to protect it from the curious. In some stories the guardian is a monkey; the monkey being a form of the Egyptian god Thoth. In most cases the forbidden secrets of the Tree are available only to those who have the inherent ability to accept the secret. In the authentic telling of the legend, those without the inherent capacity for an understanding of the secret are neither attracted to the secret nor altered in any way from its proximity. In the tangled re - telling of Genesis, it is clear that the primal parents were being punished not for acting on sinful desires put in them by the Lord himself, but for their free - will , their free choice of action against the Lord's mean ingless prohibition. They are penalized and ruined due to the operation of natural drives. They are disobedient to god but obedient to their own senses, their own heart's desire and their own natural inclinations. Though the serpent has come down to be a s ymbol of temptation, a proper reading of the drama shows the serpent to be"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"more a symbol of independence and freedom. A slave is slave even if god is his master. And slavery is not spiritual, not in any time or in any place. Disobedience can only occur if one has to rebel against something that restrains. And such rebellion is a good and necessary thing. God does not reward man for his natural disobedience, but the serpent does. Man is bestowed total comprehension when he eats of the tree. He does have his eyes opened, and does not die, as Jehovah said he would. The serpent's word is more true than god's word. Adam becomes a god in his own right, and this is surely what compromises the god of the Old Testament. It is that Adam becomes his own authority that r ankles the orthodox status quo. And this self - dependence is as taboo now as it was then. Sadly, most men have subconsciously accepted the Orwellian programming of \"Obey and be Free!\" Some few, however, know this Double - Speak to be the monstrous psychic tyr anny it always has been. It grieved him to the heart that he had made so rebellious a creature as man - (Gen 6:6) Adam Tormented Adam was told that he would suffer death if he ate of the forbidden fruit. But as Graves relates, how would Adam have known or have feared the nature of the threat since he had never seen anything dead. And we can also question why Adam would have feared death if, as we are told, he was meant to be made in the image of god. Did our progenitor fear as we fear? W as his mind, even at that early time, filled with anxiety and foreboding? Did God create beings in his own image and then treat them as if he wished to tantalize them and render them unhappy? It would seem that he created man for no other purpose than to tease and torment him , and quarrel with him. Common sense would suggest it to be the act of an ignoramus or a tyrant to implant in man the desire to eat fruit which he did not allow him to eat...God must have had the power without the will to prevent the act of disobedience, w hich would make him an unjust and unmerciful tyrant. Or else the will without the power, which would make him a weak and frail being, and not a God. The \"God\" spoken of in the Book of Genesis , and throughout the Christian scriptures, is, psychologically sp eaking, a projection of the human ego, which came into being 13,500 years ago in order to offset the complete psychic breakdown of survivors of the great earth cataclysms and upheavals that are now known to have wrought havoc throughout the globe at that t ime. This \"god\" is an extension of the human drive or will to exist and is phylogenetically very young. It acts like a child and is patently animistic and violent. Like William Blake's devilish Orc, the ego was born in flames. Man could not have survived w ithout the advent of the ego which, like a muscle, saved human consciousness from complete traumatic overload. However, since the ego was born from trauma of unimaginable magnitude, its drives are \"spastic\" and"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"overly sensitized to threat. Should a threat appear from outside, the ego reacts with flight or fight tendencies. It does this on the personal level, and also on the Collective level. The scriptures make a great deal more sense when it is understood how god is made in man's image. Man (Adam) has inde ed been tormented by the god that saved him from annihilation. This \"god\" energy functions best under pressure of trauma, and this is why our world and our thinking is so beset. Silence, calm, peace and respite are not conducive criteria for the existence of the ego - the vengeful, brooding god who hides in plain sight. Julian Jaynes... has suggested that human consciousness has changed its character even in historical times, the ego as we know it was not really in existence, except under extreme stress. And t hen it presented itself almost as an exterior intrusion into consciousness, like the voice of a god - Terrence McKenna (Institute of Noetic Sciences Magazine. September - November 2000 edition) In the Origins of Consciousness and the Breakdown of the Bicamer al Mind, Julian Jaynes argued that self - consciousness emerged even more recently – at the time of the Bronze Age, some five thousand years ago. According to Jaynes, there was no sense of ―I‖ before this period. It was their first experience of the Thinking Mind‘s internal monologue, Jaynes speculates, that ancient peoples attributed to hearing the voice of god, or being addressed by spirits - Gregg D. Jacobs ( The Ancestral Mind ) Uniqueness of Jehovah There is nothing very unique about Yahweh, as Massey, Kuh n, Graves and others have shown. He was not the only god of the Israelites and his name can be found in earlier times among differing peoples, later falsely purported to be the Israelites of the Old Testament. Moreover, every epithet given to Jehovah (\"lor d of heaven,\" \"the most high,\" etc,) were used time and time again for Marduk, Baal, and other gods and deities of the ancient world. If Jehovah was so unique, why did his followers not come up with brand - new epithets? W hy borrow from nations thought pagan and infidel? No, facts are facts; there is nothing unique or holy about the Jehovah of the Bible. Nature of Jehovah The truth is, the imaginary God of the Jews was a suspicious, cowardly, and jealous being. He was constantly getting into hot water. He app eared to live in perpetual fear day and night that some other God, or some of his own creatures, would encroach upon his rights. In this case he seemed to be alarmed for fear those ignorant, deluded tower - builders and world fanatics would succeed in reachi ng the heavenly home, perhaps bind him, and cast him out of his own kingdom. What superlative nonsense is the whole story! And yet millions believe it to be divinely inspired, and many thousands of dollars have been spent in printing it, and circulating it over the world - Kersey Graves ( Bible of Bibles )"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"Jehovah's Anger Man's god is nothing but a projection of his own ego - consciousness. Many are the proofs for this psychologically legitimate assertion.

He first declares his world \"good\" but then, stra ngely, finds it so full of flaws, so full of evil, that he decides to eradicate the whole of his creation. He is full of remorse for creating man, but after he wipes out all creation, he is remorseful about that also, and promises never to do such a thing again (Gen 9). So Jehovah's response to evil in the world, is to commit an act of global genocide. W e can only wonder at these accounts, and surmise that what god really objected to was not Adam and Eve's natures, but their lack of obedience. W as it the fr ee - will exercised by the primal parents that so infuriated the Lord? Obedience is after all considered the foremost virtue in the Bible. And the opposite of obedience to authority is free will. Is this the reason for the wrath in the Book of Genesis? It ce rtainly seems to be so. The Deluge (Flood) The story of an Ark, a Flood and of the world's destruction did not originate with the Bible's version. In fact, the story of Noah is quite a late rendition. Thousands of years before, the Irish Nuah or Nuada, bro ught his people to safety on Ireland's shores in long boats constructed to weather the destruction of Atlantis and the lost continents of old. All of the great nations had stories of"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"a great flood and of the few survivors. The Persians and Chaldeans had th eir survivor Xisuthra, who was warned by god in a dream, and who was told to save his wife and daughter and every pair of animals in the world from the coming destruction by rain. The Greeks had their Deucalion whose story is almost identical. The Chinese have their Fohi, the Brahmins their Manu, and the Hindus their Satravarata. One legend the world over. For Shem, Ham and Japhet, the Hindus have a Sherma, Charma and Jyapheta - (Kersey Graves on the sons of Noah) The Building of the Ark God then goes to a drunkard (\"man just and perfect\") called Noah, and tells him to ensure his own family's survival by building a peculiar vessel that would ride out the cataclysms that the Lord was about to visit on the whole earth. Into this vessel two of every animal on t he earth was to be loaded with enough food for its survival. This strange craft is 550 feet and has one small window of 18 square inches. Every animal that \"creepeth\" on the earth are gathered, and they embark in the ark in one day. The Lord instructed him (Noah) to build and ark five hundred and fifty feet long, ninety feet wide, and fifty - five feet high - about the size of an eastern warehouse... And God ordered to be taken into this ark food sufficient to supply these millions of mouths. This alone would have required forty such vessels. As it was declared that God destroyed everything every living thing from the face of the Earth, it would have been necessary to have food stored away to last several years, until the earth could have had time to be replen ished with a new crop of grass and vegetables... Noah's Character We are told that Noah became so drunk as to strip off all his clothing, and two of his sons, to avoid seeing him in that situation, walked backward, and covered him: for which at his father cursed him. Thus it was that Noah, although \"a righteous man\" was not a very modest or decent one. A Very Full Ark Consider for a moment what amount of food would be required for each species of animal. The four elephants...would consume a ton of hay in tw o days, making more than one hundred and fifty tons in twelve months. The fourteen rhinoceroses would consume one thousand and fifty tons. And then the horses, cattle, sheep, goats, asses, zebras, antelopes, and other mammals, would require at least two th ousand tons more; making in the aggregate three - thousand two - hundred tons. This alone would have filled every inch of the vessel. The seven hundred and eighty - four thousand birds (one hundred and twelve thousand species) would require grain, which would ma ke it necessary to store several thousand bushels. The three thousand flesh - eating animals, including lions, cats, dogs, jackals, hyenas, skunks, weasels, crocodiles, snakes,"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"eagles, hawks, buzzards, etc. would require about forty wagon - loads to be slaught ered and fed to them each day, for all would require fresh meat but the buzzards. And, of course, the list of ark inhabitants goes on considerably. There would have been otters, and kingfishers and storks, 900 species of fly - catchers and all manner of inse cts for them to feed on throughout the day and night, owls with field - mice to feast on, ant - eaters with millions of ants to satiate them, 442 species of monkeys requiring fresh fruit, millipedes, fleas, lice and cockroaches, etc, And think of the immense l abor required to obtain this innumerable collection of animals. In the first place, either Noah or his god must make a trip to the polar regions to obtain the white bear, the reindeer, the polar dog, etc, And then the Rocky Mountains must be scaled to find and catch the grizzly bear. Some time and labor must have been required to obtain the rattlesnakes, copperheads, vipers, cobras, snapping - turtles, etc. of the torrid zone. And how could this immense multitude of respiring and perspiring animals live and b reathe in a vessel with but one little twenty - two - inch window, and that in the third story, and shut up most of the time to keep the rain out, especially if some giraffe had been disposed to monopolize it when it was open by thrusting its head out...And wh at was there to prevent the nine hundred carnivorous animals from devouring the sheep, hogs, poultry, rabbits, minks, hedgehogs, etc. as they tumbled pell - mell down the mountain together. But let us observe more closely the actions of Noah with his three sons and their three anonymous wives that, according to the Bible were the sole survivors of the corrupt world that existed before the great Flood, after spending a total of 375 days in their enormous ship! We will have to go into detail here, and read fro m the biblical text to make sure that the duration of the episode of the flood was not a mere 40 days, as almost all religious people are inclined to believe: \"And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righ teous before me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. And Noah did according unto all th at the LORD commanded him. And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the fl ood were upon the earth. \" - (Genesis 7) Even while the Ark had settled for 70 days on land...and the raven is flying to and fro...after seven more days the dove is sent off...and finally by New Year's Eve the dove does not return any more...a very strange fact for a paired dove, that has lived a year in"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"the ark. The dove does not return because the water had \"subsided from off the earth.\" However, Noah did not decide to leave the ark, even then. He sat tight in the crowded ark for 57 more days until without making up his mind to open the ark even though the dove had left the ark never to return a couple of months before. It appears that the dove...did not play any role in Noah's decision to leave the ark, where the beasts of the Earth must have been living i n a suffocating environment after an entire year of confinement - Michael Kalopoulos ( Biblical Religion: The Great Lie ) God's Trouble - Making Serpent The idea of God creating a serpent to thwart and defeat his plans and designs, or permitting him to do it, is absolutely ridiculous. If God knew, when he created the serpent, that his machinations would bring \"death and sin and all our woe\" into the world, the act would prove him to be an unprincipled being. And, if he did not know it, he must have been ignoran t and short - sighted, and not fit to be a God...It would seem that the serpent was superior to Jehovah either in knowledge or veracity; for his statement relative to the effect of eating the fruit proved to be true, while that of Jehovah proved to be false. (See Genesis 3:3) Crazy Story of Cain How could Cain find a wife in the land of Nod (Gen 5:17) when he himself had killed the whole human race excepting his father and mother? There were then no women to make wives of. Why did Cain build a city (Gen 4:17) , when there was nobody to inhabit it? As there were \"workers of iron and brass\" in this city, does it not furnish evidence that there was a race of people who had attained a high state of civilization before Adam was made...If Cain did find a wife in the land of Nod, is it not evidence that some of his ribs had been converted into women before Adam's time?...Did not Jehovah know, when he accepted Abel's offering and rejected Cain's, that he was sowing the seeds of discord that would lead to murder? And we note also that Cain did not require any \"serpent\" to spur him to his murderous deed. So, was his action prompted by his own nature given him by god? Nowhere does it say otherwise. In this case, we have human beings whose malefic actions are not prompted by any external agency. How is this to be explained away? Crazy Story of Moses The story of the birth of Moses is a direct copy of that of Sargon the great Babylonian King. But if it were true, this is what we are being told: The Pharaoh becomes hostile to h alf - Israelites like Moses' mother. He orders that all Israelite children should be killed at birth. W e are not told the reason for this decision. The mid - wives disobey the Pharaoh, saying that the Israelite women give birth so fast and lively that they get their too late to do any killing (see Exodus1:22).

W e are not told why a loving mother who has been hiding her child from death, should suddenly decide to put her child onto the river for the crocodiles to eat. After the Pharaoh's daughter has her servants retrieve the basket, she falls in love with the foreign child and decides to take for herself. The fact that it was totally against the law for any unmarr ied Pharaoh's daughter to adopt a foreign child does not seem to worry this author, who penned this preposterous story centuries after the time it was said to have occurred. Nevertheless, the next amazing thing that happens concerns the immediate appearanc e of Miriam, the sister of Moses, who happened to be in the area watching what was happening. Now, seemingly with no care for her own security, she appears to the Pharaoh's daughter to ask her whether she needs a maid to look after the child she has just t hat moment found among the bulrushes. The Pharaoh's daughter decides that it would be a good idea to get a maid to look after the child, and Miriam suggests that she has the perfect care - giver - the original mother of Moses. She deceives the Pharaoh's daug hter who, unwittingly, entrusts her son adopted infant back into the care of the real mother.

Note : (Did This Nonsense Happen?) - The scholars of the Bible vehemently assure us that, despite the implausibility of these tales, they are accurate and historical. They say that the name Moses does mean something in Hebrew so obviously Moses actually existed. And they h ave gone to the Talmud and the Koran to verify the Bible, and to the Bible to verify the Talmud, and to the Bible to re - verify the Koran.

However, their own words betray the truth, once we kn ow how to read between lines. Here is a perfect example of lies being made palatable. This quote is from Ahmed Osman's book Christianity: An Ancient Egyptian Religion.

Moses, Greatest Writer Ever ...the man Moses, .learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. (another Christian assurance; Acts vii, 22), sat down in the Wilderness of Sinai and under divine inspiration wrote his Five Books of prehistorical history, codes o f postexilic divine Law, and chronicles of contemporary and future notable events, including four different names of his father - in - law..(Wz.: Jethro, Ex. iii, 1; Reuel, Ex. ii, 18; Jether, Ex. iv, 18, and Raguel, Num. x, 29, while a fifth name, Hobab, is a warded him in Judges iv, II), together with a graphic account of his own death and burial, and of the whole month afterwards spent by all Israel mourning his death - James Wheless ( Forgery in Christianity, 1930) Death of Aaron, Brother of Moses He (Moses) also records the death of his brother Aaron at Mt. Hor (Num. xx, 28; xxxiii, 38), just six months before his own death; though, in amazing contradiction, he elsewhere records Aaron as having died at Mosera, just after leaving Sinai (Deut. x, 6), thirty - nin e years previously...and thus nullifies the entire history of the wonderful career and deeds of Aaron as high priest during the whole 40 years of wandering in the Wilderness, of which the Books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers are largely filled - James Whe less ( Forgery in Christianity, 1930) Facts on the Exodus Chapter 47 of the Book of Genesis, we read that Joseph was given the right by Pharaoh to bring his father and brothers into Egypt, to live in the area known as Goshen. It is from this event that the Israelites begin their stay in Egypt. God declares that his people will spend 400 years in Egypt as slaves (Gen. 15:13).

The Red Sea Story The Israelites come to an impassable sea. God causes a great wind to descend that is so strong it parts the waters pushing them back for a time, allowing the Israelites to cross. Of course we are not told how the Israeli tes could cross the Red Sea in such a wind, one so powerful as to push back millions of gallons of water. One would think that this wind would be more of a deterrent than the waters themselves. Jehovah Captured W e are told, in the early books of the Bible, that Jehovah was contained in the Ark of the Covenant and carried around by the Israelites. He was carried by David into war against the Philistines who were winning many victories against the Lord's \"Chosen People.\" Nevertheless, the Philistines slew 30, 000 Israelites, captured the Ark with the Lord Jehovah inside, and took it with them as booty. After many decades, the Philistines decided they could not use the Ark and gave it back to the Israelites. As it was being driven home by two cows, it nearly fel l off a cliff (Exodus 20:4). A character called Uzzah, seeing that it was about to topple from the road, stretched out his hand to save the cart. He was thanked by being destroyed by the Lord. W hen the Ark was passing through the city of Bethshemesh, the L ord killed 50,000 people just because two curious citizens had looked upon the Ark. W e must ask how it is that God can be carried round in a box, and then be captured by enemies who then, later, return God to their enemies. We can ask but we can be sure to receive few rational answers. W e might also want to avoid the histories that clearly refer to, and even depict, the Hindu Ark and the Egyptian Ark that were also carried aloft by the priests and that operated miraculously. Daniel, Reader of Dreams W e are told that Daniel was brought before the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar to interpret his dreams. W e are not told why Daniel could do what all the Babylonian Magi could not do for their king. Nevertheless, we also find that the king had even forgotten his dr eam completely. Daniel had to remind the king what his dream had been, before he set to interpreting it.

Did not Jesus prophesize when he told his disciples that he would \"come again?\" Did not John the Baptist not prophesize that one would come who was \"greater\" than he? Additionally, did not Jesus prophesize the falling of the temple, the betrayals of Peter and Judas, and did not the \"three wise men\" know about the birth of Jesus through prophecy?

Arjuna of India stopped it several days for his own accommodation. Yahweh killed more enemies than Joshua did by throwing huge stones down on them from heaven. The kinds were captured hiding in a cave and executed by Joshua.

Yes, an amazing increase indeed. But this kind of account shows us not only how loosely numbers were thrown around, but how ignorant the writers of the spurious accounts were in regards simple mathematics and geography . This kind of account adds credence to those scholars who believe the Israelites to have never existed. The various accounts were hurriedly compiled centuries after the events related were said to have occurred. And we can now go so far as to doubt the ev ents themselves, as well as doubt the idiotic accounts that millions still believe have historical veracity. There is no veracity to an Israelite tribe, for as Alvin Boyd Kuhn, Conor MacDari and Kersey Graves have shown, the original \"Hebrews\" were Celtic Magi from Ireland and not a race of people from the Middle East. (See Astro Pages 2 and 4). Lately, the question of the veracity of the Israelites has been highlighted by investigators such as Moustafa Gadalla, Ahmed Osman and Ralph Ellis. These investigat ors find consensus in one particular area, that concerning the lack of historical veracity of Bible's accounts.

One would think that a Jew about to be exalted by god, and one of the \"Chosen People,\" would know who his own god was. But what of the murdered Egyptian? W as he not a human being and one of God's Chosen? W hy is Moses not penalized or sent to Purgatory or Hell? W hy is he let off the hook? If all life is sacred and if the high ethics of Judaism are truly non - negotiable then how come we hear nothing more about Moses' murderous deeds, and the after - affects. How is it that we hear no remonstration from Yahweh about the slaughter of the Philistines, Amelikites, Midianites, or Canaanites, or the dead first - bor n among the Egyptians? No, we hear of no lament, sorrow, or remonstration from this merciless god. On the contrary, it is this demonic \"god,\" this fuming, tyrannical, sadistic, megalomaniacal Yahweh, who orders all these atrocities to occur. He punishes hi s servants for not obeying his cruel commands. Nature of the \"Chosen People\" From a cool - headed observation of the accounts that give insight into the behavior of the Jewish \"Chosen Ones,\" we can see just how primitive they were. Their behavior leads us to believe, along with the most astute investigators, that they were indeed uncivilized wanderers without their own settlements, homes, or cities. Their behavior and habits towards nature, animals, and diet, toward their own king, toward children, women and foreigners, openly betrays this fact. The behavior of the Jews which caused antipathy even among their own \"Prophets\" reveals that they knew nothing of the customs and morals that were known to civilized city peoples. When we compare this stock to the Egyp tians, Phoenicians, Celts, Romans, Chaldeans, Gauls, Goths, Teutons, and Etruscans, to the Brahmins and Chinese and even to the Native American Indians, we get a clear picture of the kind of people we are told to believe were Yahweh's \"Chosen.\" Their own K ing David declared: There is none righteous: no, not one. Jesus called them: A generation of vipers. Their own prophet Isaiah (who himself traveled through Egypt and Ethiopia stark naked, see Isaiah 20:3), says of his own people: Their hands are defiled wi th blood, and their fingers with iniquity; and their lips speak lies; their tongues mutter perverseness. None of them call for justice; none of the plead for truth. They trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hand. Their feet run to evil, and they make"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"haste to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths. The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink. They are swallowed up of wine, They are out of the way through strong drink. They err in vision, They stumble in judgment. Biblical scholar Rev. Hilliard said of them: They were by nature, perhaps, the most cruel and blood - thirsty, as well as idolatrous, peopl e in this world. Dr. Burnet (a Christian writer), in his book Archaelologia Philosophie says: They were of a gross and sluggish nature, not qualified for the contemplation of natural things, nor the perception of divine ones. And consequently, Moses provid ed nothing for them of an intellectual nature, and promised them nothing beyond this life...\" Lactantius says: They were never visited by the learned men of other countries, because they were never famous for literature. St. Cyril says: Moses never attempte d to philosophize with the Jews, because they were 'grossly ignorant' and addicted to idolatry. Dr. Burnet also says of them: They were depraved in all their manners and discipline, and almost bereaved of humanity. If I may speak the truth...they were a vi le company of men - and assembly of slaves brought out of Egypt...who understood no art but that of making bricks. And most of these testimonials come from their own prophets and supportive biographers. W e can see that they were not worthy of much praise, but they could certainly be useful to the Church later formed in their name, a church that could plant upon them names and titles that did not belong there; a church that could fix upon such rootless people a sublime religion originating elsewhere, in the far western hemisphere of the world. W e can empty our finest mansions and sell off the furniture to later find it in the slums of vagabonds and derelicts. The specimen who finds it hard to sit upon a Louis XIV chair is hardly the same specimen who made it. And yet this is akin to that which we are meant to ingest by the Judeo - Christian hoaxers, in regards matters of Biblical history. From all that we read from such sources, it appears sensible to agree with Graves when he summarizes the dilemma: Some of the laws which Moses adopted for the government of the Jews corroborates still further the statement that they occupied a very low position in the scale of morals as well as intellect; for the laws of a nation are a true standard of their character. Hence the law of Moses prohibiting uncleanliness (Lev 15), the law against incest (Lev 18). Laws against bestiality, to prohibit both sexes from carnal familiarity with beasts, and various other laws of a similar character, furnish a clear implication that they wer e addicted to all these vile habits; and a law to compel them to wash their hands leads to the conclusion that they were inclined to be filthy in their habits. W e might add, in light of these revelations, how unlikely it is that this nation of Jews spent a ny time in Egypt. It is less likely that they, as scholars like Ralph Ellis insist, were Pharaohs in the land of Egypt. This supposition hardly gels well with the facts regarding their despicable moral and physical nature. At"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"least we must remain suspiciou s of any modern investigator who insists that the Israelites were elites in Egyptian society. This thesis is getting more and more acceptance of late, and comes to us with its own inconsistencies and errors. (These matters will be dealt with in other works by this author). Did They Even Exist? It is not hard to build a case for the non - existence of the so - called Israelite race. And it is even less difficult to build a case for their depravity, given that they did exist. If we are looking for evidence showin g how primitive, superstitious, lawless, moral - less, covetous, genocidal, murderous, and maniacal was this tribe, we need look only to their own works and to the accounts of historians who wrote about them. Only a depraved soul can imagine or consider that these entities are identical with the Arch - Magi of Egypt and Ireland, or are the same persons as those who preserved the secrets of the cosmos, the religious elite of ancient times who lived in harmony with flora and fauna and who practiced the highest an d noblest sciences. The entities spoken of in these Biblical chapters are hardly identical with those who were in the habit of musing on the deepest matters of philosophy and metaphysics. That millions in the world have convinced themselves otherwise is no t strange to us when we realize from what churches and colleges they have received their \"knowledge\" of history. W hat kind of minds would be drawn to revere such a perverse god? Clearly, it is similarly depraved souls that seek to identify with the persona lities of Christianity‟s gruesome scriptures. Although most people will not consciously condone the accounts of blood - lust and vengeance, etc, we cannot avoid suspecting the presence of unconscious drives that find attraction to such deeds. Indoctrination aside, we must ask what other reason could there be that would make any man or woman humble their dignity before a Church and a book built on such perfidy? W e might be astonished at the answer. Character of Abraham Abraham's conduct towards his servant - gir l Hagar is both disgraceful and inhuman, as he first destroyed her character and virtue by criminal intimacy, and then turned her and her child into the wilderness to starve (Gen 21)...And this is the man who is represented as being chosen by a God of infi nite wisdom, infinite purity, and infinite holiness, to stand at the head of the moral regeneration and salvation of this whole human race. Abraham - Liar Extraordinaire When Abraham and Sarah, having traveled something like 700 miles across Canaan, get to Egypt the very first thing that they do is lie to the ruling Pharaoh. In the preposterous concocted story Abraham appears a deceiver of"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"great proportion and anything but a man of god. He lies to Pharaoh and makes Sarah out to be his sister rather than his wife. The Pharaoh then marries Sarah and only complains when great plagues fall upon Egypt. Pharaoh suspects something is wrong, that he has offended the gods, and confronts Abraham who then admits that he deceived the king. Now, this is the first crime pe rpetuated the Bible (after Adam's sin) and suggestively, as we can see, it is perpetrated upon the Jews but committed by one of them. Abraham does the lying and deceiving, not the Egyptian Pharaoh. This cheater made himself fat and rich, and was awarded st atus and protection in Egypt because of his cunning. W hat kind of man would do this kind of thing without remorse or hesitation? It is more than suggestive, therefore, that the first son born of the primal parents, Cain, should turn out to be a murderer an d that the first Patriarch of the Jews should be a immoral, cunning, lying, reckless, and self - aggrandizing criminal. (See Genesis 12:18, for the Biblical account). The Bible dates are so far off that no rational person can take them seriously...Terah, Josep h‘s great great grandfather, was seventy when his son Abram was born. Terah, we are later told, died at the age of two hundred and five. Astonishingly, a few biblical verses later we learn that Abram was seventy - five when his father died, when according to biblical calculations, Abram should have been one hundred and twenty - five years old and not seventy - five - Moustafa Gadalla ( Historical Deception ) Abraham Sacrificing His Son Whether it was his actual first - born son, or just that one born from a lesser wi fe, it appears an that Abraham is all to willing to submit to the depraved will of his Lord, and does not stand and question why this deed should need to be done. Again, we find that obedience is what turns the Lord on, not free - will or independence. And w hy would an all - knowing god need to check the faith of one of his mortal servants. Does this not imply ignorance on the part of the Lord concerning the actions of his creations. \" Now I know that thou fearest god,\" says Jehovah to Abraham, after the wicked experiment is concluded. Laban, Master of Treachery and Deceit Jacob has to hide out from the wrath of his brother Esau, and does so far away from home. He visits his strange and possibly insane uncle Laban, and meets his future wife Rachel there. However, his ungracious uncle makes Jacob jump through some major hoops in order to win his daughter. The proneness of the Lord's holy people to falsify, cheat and deceive is well illustrated in the case of Laban, who, after Jacob had, by a fair contract, labored seven years for him for his daughter Rachel, would not let him have her, but forced his older daughter Leah upon him; and, when Jacob complained, he told him he must serve seven years more if he got Rachel; and his love for her prompted him to accept the t erms.

David - The Despot, Ingrate , Seducer, and Mass Murderer Its a case of will the real David please stand up. W e don't have one David but two. W e don't have one time period in which he lived but two, and they are 500 years apart. The task of identifying the historical David is complica ted from the outset by the fact that the Old Testament provides us with two contrasting Davidic characters who cannot have been the same person...Scholars have largely chosen, despite the lack of any genealogical link between him and the start of the Chris tian era, to identify this tribal chief as King David, who is presented to us in a number of guises - shepherd; rival to Saul and later Ishbosheth, one of Saul's surviving sons; for the Israelite leadership; an accomplished harpist; \"a man of war;\" slayer of Goliath in an epic duel; and a coward who fled from the wrath of his son, Absalom - Ahmed Osman ( Christianity: An Ancient Egyptian Religion ) David - The Aged Seducer The Book of Kings opens with a remarkable scene. Remarkable for its pornographic featur es that is: Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her c herish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king - (1 Kings 1) David - The Rapist David and his armies are fighting at Jerusalem. David spots the lovely Bathsheba, the wife of one of his chief warriors, a Hittite called Uriah. Behind Uriah's back, this great king, gets his guards to bring Bathsheba, another man's wife, to him so he can seduce her. Ba thsheba becomes pregnant as a result of David's fornicating attentions. David then has his guards position Uriah in the front of the battle so that he might be slain. In the Book of Samuel, we read:"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle...tha t he may be smitten and die - (Samuel 11:15) What a decent, loving, god - inspired king, was the good David. A man who sends his great allies to be slaughtered by enemies after raping their wives. And many a modern writer (Gadalla, Osman, Ellis, Gardner, etc, ) speculate that this David was the same personage as the great Egyptian Pharaoh Tuthmosis III, grand warrior king of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Are we to believe that the greatest Pharaohs of Egypt acted in such a despicable manner? It seems so. David could not murder Uriah at Jerusalem because the soldier did not want to remain in comfort while his troops were suffering hardship in the fields of battle. This is why David had him positioned at the most dangerous locales of the battle instead. Here we see the brutal conniving character of the \"chosen\" ones of Yahweh, a brutal and conniving god. David and Goliath In fact, like the vast majority of the Bible's hodgepodge, the David and Goliath tale was a blatant plagiarism. It was taken from an Egyptian tale, ver y well known in antiquity, entitled The Autobiography of Sinuhe, which spoke of deeds that occurred thousands of years in the past. It is Sinuhe, not David, who travels and does battle with a strange giant. But the Israelite scribes of later ages believed that few would remember the Egyptian original, and did not mind re - scripting the tale to aggrandize their own hero. No matter that it was among the favorite morality tales of the Egyptians for millennia. So, in light of this, if we take away the stories of the \"biographical\" David, we are not left with much of a biography. No, we are not left with a David. And the same rule applies across the board, when it comes to the dramatis personae of the Bible. Fictional or biographical, there is barely a thing that this Judaic David did that was not immoral in the extreme. But we are not given these stories in Sunday School. W e hear the edited accounts, that suit the fiction being manufactured for our sullied palates. One of his first acts of moral delinquency was th at of turning traitor to Achish, King of Gath. After the king had kindly given him a rulership over the city of Ziklag, he manifested his ingratitude by waging an unprovoked war for plunder upon the king's friends and relatives, to rob them of their cattle (1 Samuel27). The manner in which David obtained his first wife Michal is shocking to all who possess kind and philanthropic feelings. Saul had proposed a hundred foreskins of the Philistines as the price of his daughter; but David, in wanton cruelty, kil led two hundred for this purpose. The manner in which David obtained his beautiful wife Bathsheba, to add to his list of wives, might be tolerated in that era of barbarism; but it must be looked upon at the present time as an act of cruelty and wickedness."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"David's murder of five step - sons and two brothers - in - law, to gratify a malignant grudge toward the House of Saul, is another act showing the fiendish character of the man...David's advice to his son Solomon, on his death - bed, to assassinate Joab and his o ther enemies, shows that his ruling passions - animosity and revenge - were strong in death. And finally, David's wicked prayer, as found in the 109th Psalm, in which he invokes a series of the most horrid curses upon his enemies, culminates his immoral hi story. The Character of Solomon Solomon's writings and history both show that he was a libertine, a tyrant, and a polygamist. His tyrannical monopoly of seven hundred wives and three hundred prostitutes, making him a practical \"Free - Lover\" on a large scale , is an indelible stigma upon his character.

Fear not.\" And when h e had turned in unto her in the tent, she covered him with a mantle, and feigned much pity for him; and, when he had fallen asleep, \"she took a nail of the tent and a hammer, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temple, and fastened it into the ground\"...And yet Jehovah, the god of Israel, is represented as saying, \"Blessed above women shall Jael , the wife of Heber the Kenite, be.\" (Judg 5:24) Character of Constantine - God's Prime Minister When the \"Christian\" emperor, Constantine, had murde red his wife, son, nephew, and several other relatives, he raised his hands toward heaven, and exclaimed, \"The blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin.\" Here is an example of the pernicious and demoralizing effect of the Christian doctrines of atonement and forgiveness. Today such a god would be declared a fascist, or a racist, or a bigot, and would be considered a pariah. But in the world of the Israelites, such a god was worthy of veneration.

W e are told that Jehovah needs Moses to secure the release of the \"Chosen People,\" but that he \"hardens Pharaoh's heart\" in order to prevent their easy release. He al so reins down all manner of plagues upon the innocent, slaying thousands who could not in any way be implicated in any crime against the Israelites. ...Jehovah is represented as killing all the first - born of all Egyptian parents without any distinction of character, or any regard to their innocence; and even the first - born beasts also.

Egypt Flooded Egypt Flooded Genesis 7:20 tells us that the waters rose 60 feet above the mountain tops, with some of the mountains being over 6 mil es high. The waters covered Egypt six miles deep.

God's Preferences and Prejudices The god of love and mercy delivers to his prophet Moses injunctions against who can be accepted in his presence. After reading through the cr iteria for entry into gods presence we might wonder how a Socrates, with his deranged features, would have faired. Like poor blind Homer, he would have been debarred from the temple of Jehovah on account of his unseemly appearance. He says \"The Lord spake unto Moses\" and told him that no person with a flat nose or crooked back or broken hand, a crooked eye, or who was lame or possessing any kind of physical blemish, should be admitted into the congregation of the Lord (Lev 21). Miracles of the Lord's Prophe ts Ezekiel, we are told, lay three hundred and ninety days on his left side, and forty days on his right side; and then, having swallowed a roll of parchment with the aid of Jehovah, he was prepared for business...Jeremiah wore cords around his neck, and a yoke on his back...Hosea claimed that God commanded him twice to go marry a whore (Hos 1:2)...Ezekiel relates a \"story\" about being carried by \"the hand of the Lord,\" and set down among some old dry bones, which he proceeded to invest with human flesh and sinews, and then drew skins over them to hold the flesh and bones together (Ezek 37).

Yes, lacking in internal authority, our human creature turns to external representatives to be guided and directed, and also to be chastised for his moral misdemeanors. All the while, the infirm soul does not realize that the god he worships is nothin g more or less than a projection of his own diseased consciousness, with all the inflated proclivities that he himself has festering within his being. Out of such a psychic miasma, man crawls forth eagerly toward the priest and the \"theology\" that tells hi m how a good god lies behind his every good deed, and how a devil hides behind his every evil deed. \"Hallelujah! - peace at last!\" cries our good Christian, \"all is explained!\" By faith ye are saved, and not of yourselves, it is the gift of God - Paul (Eph 2:8) Question of \"Graven Images\" There is no greater sin for Christians than idolatry. It is considered worse than murder in the Bible. So important was it that the prohibition, that is found in the Ten Commandments, can be found before that which says \"T hou Shalt Not Kill.\" For all the rhetoric, there is not much sanity in the prohibition. ... can it be more sinful to make an image of him with the hand than with the head? In other words, to construct a likeness of him externally, than to construct it inter nally? Certainly not.

So, we see the problem in a rati onal light and uncover yet more insanity in the Christian world. Yet, we must still seek an answer for this strange and seemingly idiotic prohibition. W e suspect that other gods were not to be depicted, but also that man was not to use his senses, and his imagination. Man was to obey, and labor, not partake in creation of his own. Creativity was for the pagans. The Christian was not to produce artwork, was not to carve, paint, fashion, sculpt, or give physical expression to his thoughts. He was to ever be r epressed, inward, stultified, conservative and morose. Let us remember the cost of obedience to this edict. The Christian world is one without Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Dali or Cezanne. Jehovah casts into his hell Van Gogh, Dante Rossetti and W illi am Blake, and all those children who have dared to draw with crayon and paint - box. Still, we know that the Church could not endure without their pictorialization of scripture. They tried it an found out that the human mind did not suffer such a void. So, t hey were compelled by necessity to revive and endorse figurative representation. Suddenly, we have the bearded and non - bearded Jesus, and Mary the Madonna; and the disciples at the table of the Last Supper, and pictures of every event in the Bible. W e have the medieval painters, the Renaissance Masters, and finally the epic movie - makers such as Cecil B. DeMille - idolaters all, but with sanction from the Pope. W e might muse that Christians are the greatest idolaters of all, since unlike the Jews they worshi p three gods instead of one: The Father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Hence revelation would be worse than useless, as it would furnish a pretext for mental or intellect ual sloth, and thus have a tendency to stop human progress by doing for us what we could and should do ourselves. Additionally, are the Jew and the Christian the only ones who are, by way of their supposed divine privilege, capable of creating works of mea ning to stir the heart, and mind, and to inspire the world?

A little reflection must convince any unbiased mind that, while men and women are taught to believe that the consequences of sin or crime can be arrested or mitigated by an act of forgiveness by the divine Law - Maker, they will feel the less restrained from the commission of crime and wickedness. They naturally look upon it as a sort of license for the indulgence of their passions and propensities...An act of forgiveness implies that the legitimate consequences of the evil deed or sinful act can be set aside, and escaped...Sci entifically speaking, the law is the cause and the penalty the effect. The clergy tell the most vile and debauched villain and bloody assassin, after he has inhumanly butchered and murdered his innocent and virtuous wife, can, by an act of repentance and f orgiveness, swing from the end of the hangman's rope directly into a heaven of pure and unalloyed bliss, and, with his fingers all dripping with human blood, join the white - robed saints... Jehovah - The Author of Evil Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame e vil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good - (Jeremiah 18:11) Passages exist in the Bible proving that Jehovah is the sole author of the evil in the world. For instan ce, in Isaiah 45:7, God says \"I create evil.\" And in Amos 3:6, Amos is asked \"Shall there be evil in a city and the Lord hath not done it.\" And in Jeremiah 18:11, we read: \"I frame evil against you.\" If \"God made everything that was made\" then he either ma de evil or the author of evil, whether that was the Devil of a serpent or a fallen angel; and this is substantially the same thing as originating evil - to originate the author of evil."},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"When Was Jesus Born? Matthew lists twenty - eight generations from David to Jesus, while Luke tabulates forty - three. According to John Jesus visited Jerusalem at least four times, but the Synoptics (Mark, Luke and Matthew) assure is that he journeyed to that city only once. As to the length of Jesus‘ ministry the Synoptics say one year, but John says at least 3 years. From the Synoptical account, we gather that the savior carried out his work chiefly in Galilee. But John informs us that Judea was the principle theatre of the ministry of Christ - John G.

The interested reader is directed to this fine work, as well as to the previously penned The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors. W e go to this labor willingly since we cannot hesitate to warn our readers concerning the Bible's outrageously contorted philosophy. This is, after all, a book in which we find mornings and evenings created before the sun, in which sons are two years older than the fathers who give them birth (see Chron 21:20), in which asses can talk and prophesize, and in which god hires his enemy Satan to tempt and then torment the most devoted amongst his believer s. It is a book in which the \"biographers\" of Jesus cannot even agree as to the time of his crucifixion, at which they were present. In short, we need not bother ourselves separating \"sheep from goats,\" just the rational from the irrational. Such a distinc tion is necessary in this world since it appears that many of the latter sort command the ships of state and hold high office in the lands and since, even in our midst, we must encounter proselytizers, advocates and adherents of this garbled oriental lore that commands so much allegiance and veneration. Indeed, we can declare the Bible to be one of the most useful books in the world, given that it provides us an excellent gauge separating, not believers from unbelievers, but the sane from the unsane .

It is difficult to translate the Bible and it is known that earlier interpreters, scribes, editors and compilers took great liberties with the material at their disposal. Every personal prejudice was given priority over historical accuracy, and every contortion of original Stellar Theology was given precedence. Every true and accurate reference to the origins of the Christ Story, to the True Natural Religion (of the Egyptians an d the Irish Druids) was consciously obscured. But"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"aside from these travesties there are several others to bear in mind. Let us take space to delineate the most obvious and persistent obstacles to interpretation as they affect the Bible and its comprehensio n, so that we may discover how intricate the web of Christianity is, and why the reason of so many people has become seized, entangled and entrapped in its glimmering but deadly strands. The Hebrew language does not have clear tenses, and these are almost indecipherable in ancient texts and chronicles. No attempt is made to clearly delineate when an event is meant to have occurred. The most general references and pointers are given most of which turn out, on closer scrutiny, to be wrong. Scholars have diffi culty even telling if a thing mentioned, happened in the past. The Book of Isaiah is a clear example of this. As Egyptian scholar and revisionist Ahmed Osman writes: ...whether Isaiah is writing about the past, present, or future depends upon what interpre tation the translator put into his words. Never, in key Old Testament tales, are we given clear references as to which Pharaoh was reigning in Egypt during key events. This persistent omission is a clear indication that the books in question, and the tall tales in them, are compilations of later times. A scribe - historian who actually lived during, or close to, the time when the scripted events were professed to have occurred, would certainly have known the Pharaoh's name and would have stated it with plenty of details about him and his times. This is not too much to ask and is to be expected of any credible historian, of anyone who should be eligible to bear that title. The concoctors of Bible passages are certainly not deserving of the title of \"Historian.\" These same concoctors repeatedly provide excruciating details concerning the most insignificant events and happenings, and labor over meaningless details concerning wells, and trees, and broken down walls, and herds of animals, and all sorts of superfluou s nonsense, but pass by the names of reigning pharaohs who are central to their dramas, and who are among the main rivals to the \"Chosen People.\" There is mention of the work of early historians, such as Manetho and Josephus, and others \"historians.\" Yet w e find out, after some study, that we do not possess their original works. W e \"known of\" their works because they were captioned or referenced by later historians that we do know existed. So, it appears that we are to accept the writings of ancient historian s because their works are referenced in the works of more recent historians. This is a given in Biblical studies, and the logic of this arbitrary irrational acceptance is rarely questioned. It is unquestioned even when evidence arises that strongly counter s centuries of belief, and that disputes the very physical existence of the first breed of historians. However, whether we accept the existence of the early historians or not, we also encounter major problems with their accounts."},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"Some accounts are so prepo sterous as to not even warrant attention. Others have lapsed from the ranks of credibility as modern science and archaeology expose their innumerable inconsistencies and fallacies. There are many clearly duplicated stories and accounts throughout the Bible . These are well catalogued. And when they are reviewed objectively they also make us suspicious as to the authenticity of the tale and the credibility of the author. This leads to yet another important point. W e have been conditioned to be inordinately re verent toward the many Bible personalities and toward the supposedly historically existent authors. W e are dutifully, but illogically, deferent toward the Jeremiahs, Josephs, Johns, and Jeromes, and the rest of the names and figures sanctified by time. Thi s spontaneous reverence also bends the mind of the student and fogs the perspective. W e have handled with kid - gloves that that should have been ditched long ago as utterly worthless. There are thousands of translations of the single work known as the \"Holy Bible.\" Additionally, it is known and recognized by both Gentile and Hebrew scholars that the first translations of the Bible (primarily the \"Septuagint\" or first Greek translation), are hopelessly flawed and filled with interpolations and mistranslations , many of which appear to be consciously made. One instance concerns the term \"Nazareth.\" Still, to this day, Jesus is said to have come from Nazareth, as if it were a place. However, at no time, and in no place, is there a record of such a locale. It is k nown to never have existed. Jesus was a \"Nazarene\" that is, a member of a hard - line sect of Jews. This discrepancy is common knowledge to most scholars and yet the church - men continue to preach the Nazareth fallacy. There are innumerable other such obvious and pernicious discrepancies.

Isaiah's original Hebrew, with the mistranslated words underscored, reads: Hinneh ha - almah harah ve - yeldeth ben ve - karath shem - o immanuel...which, falsely transla ted by the false pen of the pious translators, runs thus in the English: Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel, (Isa. 7:14).

It was practiced for centuries among the Hebrews, constituting a part of the temple worship, the Jewish kings, with the except ion of a few, like Hezekiah and Josiah, sanctioning it. Solomon's temple was largely a Pagan temple. Before it stood two Phallic pillars, while its doors were ornamented with symbols of Phallic and Solar worship.

E. H. Lecky ( History of European Morals, Vol. II) Monotheism To Judaism Christians ascribe the glory of having been the first religion to teach a pure monotheism. But monotheism existed long before the Jews attained to it. Zoroaster and his earliest followers were monotheists, dualism being a later development of the Persian theology. The adoption of monotheism by the Jews , which occurred only at a very late period in their history, was not, however, the result of a divine revelation, or even of an intellectual superiority, for the Jews were immeasurably inferior intellectually to the Greeks and Romans, to the Hindus and Eg yptians, and to the Assyrians and Babylonians, who are supposed to have retained a belief in polytheism. This monotheism of the Jews has chiefly the result of a religious intolerance never before equaled and never since surpassed, except in the history of Christianity and Mohammedanism, the daughters of Judaism. Jehovistic priests and kings tolerated no rivals of their god and made death the penalty for disloyalty to him.

This history, summarized, is substantially as follows: \"The god is born about December 25th, without sexual intercourse, for the sun, entering the winter solstice, emerges in the sign of Virgo, the heaven ly Virgin. His mother remains ever - virgin, since the rays of the sun, passing through the zodiacal sign, leave it intact.

Atonism & the Cult of Mithras Read Book Atonism has adopted many strange guises down through the long ages since it was born in, and eventually expunged from, Egypt. As we reveal in our works, Atonist elements are overwhelmingly conspicuous in Judaism, Culdeanism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Gnosticism, as well as in Masonry and Templarism. W e have also shown that Atonism was a corruption of Druidism and Amenism, the ancient stellar theologies. Authors from a Christian background, who may be apologists for Judaism and Christianity, habitually demonize Druidism and Amenism in their various works. This is inevitable it seems given their skewed perspectives of world history. Regardless of these regrettable prejudices which often serve to mar their works, many authors inadvertently provide us with excellent insights into the manner in which corruptions of so lar worship, such as Atonism, spread throughout the world in early times. In this section we provide excepts from the book entitled Terror and the Illuminati, by David Livingstone. This book deals with the spread of th e supposedly Persian Cult of Mithras. This cult (of which Sol Invictus Cult was but a variant) was prominent during the period of Roman imperial expansion and during the rise of Christianity. Unlike Mr. Livingstone, however, we are convinced that this str ange solar sect or cult was little more than a cover for Atonism.

Those familiar with our work on the Irish origins of civilization, will understand the connections between the Egyptian, Roman, and British Atonists, and the manner in which they gained converts and worked to secu re their great but insidious world order. Livingstone also traces the all - important connections between these Atonist or, as he refers to them, \"Judaic\" or \"Davidic\" bloodlines, and the modern royal dynasties. He deals with the elite houses of Sinclair, A ngevin, Lorraine, Guise, W elf (Guelph), Brandenburg, Hapsburg, Merovingian, Carolingian, Stuart, and Plantagenet, etc. Of great interest also were the connections between the \"Jewish\" Herod family, Roman Caesars, and Templars of France and Scotland (the Te mplars being Merovingians).

This network was centered around the House of Herod, and included an important Armenian bloodline. The importance of this Armenian bloodline figures both in their supposed descent from the Lost Trib e, and their mixed Alexandrian and Persian heritage, a hereditary Syrian priesthood of Baal, and the family of Julius Caesar. It was the coalescence of"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"these families, at the turn of the first Millennium BC, that effectively incepted the conspiracy. And, w hile the trail of these familial relationships is complicated and detailed, it is essential to examine them, in order to properly understand the origin, direction and beliefs of their successors, the Illuminati. Essentially, these families were responsible for the formation and spread of the Mithraism, the most popular cult of the Roman Empire. It was this cult that remained the core doctrine of the Illuminati for centuries to come. Initially, the formation of Mithraism served a conspiracy to supplant the C hristian Church. It was ultimately successful, when one of their descendants, Constantine the Great, implemented Catholicism, which was but an assimilation of Mithraism, associating Jesus with the cult of the dying - god. The cult eventually penetrated to th e Islamic world to produce the heresy of the Ismailis, from which emerged the first terrorist network, the Assassins. It was the legend of contact with the Assassins with the notorious Knights Templars, during the Crusades, which became the basis of Scotti sh Rite Freemasonry. Initially, the cult of the heretical Magi was most prevalent in that part of Asia Minor, that is, of Armenia, Cappadocia and Pontus. Pontus was founded following the death of Alexander the Great, shortly after 302 BC. As the greater pa rt of this kingdom lay within the immense region of Cappadocia, which in early ages extended from the borders of Cilicia to the Black Sea, the kingdom as a whole was at first called “Cappadocia towards the Pontus”, but afterwards simply “Pontus”. Pontus in cluded not only Pontic Cappadocia, but also Colchis, and Lesser Armenia. Therefore, this cult of the Magi, which worshipped the dying - god in the form of Mithras, was most prevalent in that part of Asia Minor to which the so - called Lost Tribes had been relo cated, to be later absorbed by Scythians and Medes. Commangene (Cappadocia) Commagene was a small kingdom, located in modern south - central Turkey, in what had once been part of greater Cappadocia, with its capital city as Samosata, or modern Samsat, near t he Euphrates. Commagene was ruled by a dynasty known as the Orontids. The dynasty was founded by Orontes, who had been appointed by the Persians as “satrap”, or governor of Armenia. In 401 BC, Artaxerxes II, then reigning Emperor of Persia, gave him his da ughter Rhodogoune in marriage. Artaxerxes II would have been the grandson of Xerxes, who according to Jewish tradition, married Esther, of the Book of Esther...The Armenian kingdom of Commagene arose in 162 BC, when its governor Ptolemy broke free from the d isintegrating Seleucid Empire. Ptolemy‟s son Mithradates I Callinicus of Commagene embraced the Hellenistic culture and married Laodice, a Seleucid princess. Thus, their son, Antiochus I of Commagene, who lived from 69 BC to 40 BC, could claim dynastical t ies with both Alexander the Great and the Persian kings. The"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"combined heritage found in Antiochus led to the assimilation of Mithras with the Greek Hercules, which marked the first early form of the Mithraic cult. The Mithraic Bloodline The House of Comma gene combined with the family of Herod the Great, the Syrian priest - kings of Baal, and the family of Julius Caesar. Together, they took the early symbolism of the Mithra worship of the heretical Magi, and combined it with the emerging Kabbalistic mysticism , to form the Mysteries of Mithras. Essentially, the Mithraic mysteries adapted the ancient king - worship of the Babylonians, to the worship of the emperor, as a personification of their god the Sun. Through the influence of the Commagenian dynasty, this cu lt retained its Persian themes, but represented its god Mithras with the physical form of their progenitor, Alexander the Great... The person through which the House of Commagene was able to enter into contact with that of Herod, in addition to the family of Julius Caesar, to produce the Mithraic bloodline, which went on to produce the leading conspiratorial families of Europe, was Antiochus IV. Antiochus IV‟s great grandfather, Antiochus I of Commagene had supported Pompey against the Parthians, and in 64 BC was rewarded with additional territories. After submitting to Greek rule under the Seleucids, the Persian Empire eventually re - emerged under the Parthians, a semi - nomadic people who, in the second century BC, arose from an area southeast of the Caspian Se a. It was ruled by the Arsacids, who claimed descent from the Persian king Artaxerxes II. Through the conquests of Mithradates I and Artabanus II in the second century BC, the Parthians established control over Iran and expanded westward into Mesopotamia. Caesar Augustus Antiochus I was able to deflect Roman attacks from Mark Antony, whom he eventually joined in the Roman civil war, but after Antony‟s defeat to Augustus, Commagene was made a Roman client state. This state of affairs signaled the beginning of the relationships that led to the transference of the Mithraic cult to Rome. Augustus, who ruled the Roman Empire from 27 BC to 68 AD, was the first of the Julio - Claudian dynasty, followed by Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, until the last of the line, Nero, who committed suicide. The dynasty is so named because its members were drawn from the Julia and the Claudius family. Julia derive their name from Iulus, or Julus, also known as Ascanius, who, according to Greek and Roman mythology, was a son of Aen eas, himself the son of Aphrodite, the Greek Venus, and the cousin of Priam. The name “Ascanius” is thought to have been derived from Ashkenazi, or Ashkuza, the name given to the Scytians by the ancient Akkadians. After the Trojan W ar, Ascanius escaped to Latium in Italy and had a role in the founding of Rome as the first king of Alba Longa. The founder of the dynasty, Caesar Augustus, was a Julian through his adoption by his great - uncle, Julius Caesar. "},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"Emperor Caligula In 17 AD, Tiberius deposed Antiochus I‟ successor, Antiochus III, but Caligula reinstated his son Antiochus IV of Commagene, and even enlarged his territory. And, although Caligula deposed him shortly after, he was again restored by Claudius in in 41 AD. In 52 AD, Antiochus VI campaigned aga inst some wild tribes there which had been harrowing the coastal cities. And Beck considers that, “it is worth considering whether the germination of the Mysteries might not have taken place when Commagenean and Cilician Mithra - worship coalesced at the exp osure of Commagenean administrators and military to the rites of the Cilician tribes.” Antiochus IV‟s associate, Caligula, was influenced by the Babylonian or Mithraic tradition of worshipping the king as embodiment of the sun - god, and cult which he tried to institute in the Roman Empire. In addition, reflecting the characteristics of his occult leanings, Caligula was described, by H. H. Scullard, a former professor of ancient history at King‟s College, as a “monster of lust and diabolical cruelty.” Caligu la and Herod Caligula, like Antiochus IV, was also a close friend of Herod Agrippa, king of Judea, also called the Great, who lived from 10 BC to 44 AD. Herod Agrippa was the king named “Herod” in the Acts of the Apostles, in the Bible. He was the grandson of Herod the Great, rebuilder of the Temple. Herod the Great arose from a wealthy, influential Idumaean family. The Idumaeans were successors to the Edomites, who had settled in Edom in southern Judea, but between 130 - 140 BC, were required to convert to J udaism. According to Josephus, after the murder of his father, young Agrippa was sent by Herod the Great to the imperial court in Rome. There, Tiberius conceived a great affection for him, and he eventually became a close friend of Caligula. And on the ass assination of Caligula in 41AD, Agrippa‟s advice helped to secure the ascension as emperor Claudius, who was also the grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia, and who eventually made Herod Agrippa governor of Judea. The Emesa Dynasty Along with Commagene and the Julio - Claudian families, a third would be introduced into this mix, which would feature in not only the creation of Mithraism, but its continued preservation through the centuries, culminating in the Illuminati families of Europe. That family was the h ereditary priest - kings of Emesa. The Royal Family of Emesa, today Hims in Syria, was a dynasty of Priest - Kingswho formed a powerful and influential aristocracy. Emesa was renowned for the Temple of the Sun, known as Elagabalus, a derivation of Baal, adored in a shape of a black stone. Around 64 BC, Pompey the Great had reorganized Syria and the surrounding countries into Roman Provinces, and had installed client kings, who would be allies to Rome. One of those client kings, would be Sampsiceramus, the found ing member of the Priest - King dynasty of Emesa."},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"St. Paul and Mithraism Paul seems to have been part of a conspiracy on the part of the House of Herod, to subvert the emerging Christian movement, by conforming it to their occult doctrines. Paul was from Tar sus, the capitol city of Cilicia, the very hub of the intrigues that produced the Mithraic religion. In addition, according to Robert Eisenmen, in Paul as a Herodian, there is evidence, in the New Testament, early Church literature, Rabbinic literature, an d Josephus, to suggest some connection between Paul and so - called “Herodians.” France and the Merovingians the myth of the union of Jesus and Mary Magdalene was preserved to disguise a more occult secret about the origin of this bloodline. More importantl y, the descendants of the Merovingians eventually intermarried with the family of Charlemagne, founder of the Holy Roman Empire, and supposedly, that of an Exilarch, or claimant to the Davidic throne, named Rabbi Makhir. It is from this lineage that all th e leading lines of European aristocracy descend, a bloodline featured as the central secret of Grail lore. The Merovingians, again, came originally from Scythia, where they were known as the Sicambrians, taking their name from Cambra, a tribal queen of abo ut 380 BC. Then, in the early fifth century AD, the invasion of the Huns provoked large - scale migrations of almost all European tribes. It was at this time that the Sicambrians, a tribe of the Germanic people collectively known as the Franks, crossed the R hine and moved into Gaul, establishing themselves in what is now Belgium and northern France. The Merovingians are believed in occult circles to have originally been Jewish, and descended from the Tribe of Benjamin, who had entered Greece known as Cadmus a nd Danaaus. Certain important details of the history of the Merovingians are related in the Fredegar‟ Chronicle, a facsimile of which is in the Biblioteque Nationale in Paris. Fredegar, who died in 660 AD, was a Burgundian scribe, and his Chronicle covered the period from the earliest days of the Hebrew patriarchs to the era of the Merovingian kings. Fredegar‟s Prologue tells how the Sicambrian line of “Franks”, from whom France acquired its name, were themselves first so called after their chief Francio, a descendant of Noah, who died in 11 BC. Prior to their Scythian days, Francio‟s race originated in ancient Troy after which the French city of Troyes was named. The city of Paris, established by the sixth century Merovingians, likewise bears the name of Pa ris, the son of King Priam of Troy, whose liaison with Helen of Sparta sparked the Trojan W ar. According to the genealogies compiled by James Allen Dow, and based largely on the work of David Hughes, a descendant of Mary Magdalene and this Jesus, Quintus T arus, a prefect of Rome, married Argotta, heiress of the Franks, to father Merovech, King of the Franks.2 The most famous of all Merovingian rulers, though, was Merovee‟s grandson, Clovis I, who reigned between 481 and 511 AD. Gaul was the richest and larg est area of the western empire, but the Frankish tribes had not succeeded"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"in organizing a single state, until Clovis defeated the surviving Roman forces in 486 AD. During his reign and that of his sons, Frankish power was extended over nearly all of Gaul a nd far into Germany. The Frankish kingdom eventually became the strongest and most extensive of the new German states, and it was the only one that truly survived into later centuries, and from it were descended the modern states of both Germany and France . The descendants of Clovis are called Merovingians. They occupied the throne of the Franks for nearly two hundred and fifty years. The annals of their reigns form an unpleasant catalogue of bloody wars, horrible murders, and deeds of treachery without num ber. Nevertheless, the earlier Merovingians were strong men, under whose direction the Frankish territory continued to expand, until it included nearly all of what is now France, Belgium, and Holland, besides a considerable part of Germany - Hutton Webster ( Early European History ) Charlemagne (the Merovingian) It is frequently claimed by genealogists that all of European aristocracy can claim descent from Charlemagne. Less well - known, though significant for occult lore, is that Charlemagne‟s descendants wer e intricately intertwined with those of one Rabbi Makhir, a Jewish Exilarch from Baghdad, known as Rabbi Makhir, or Natronai, who became the father of Guillaume the Gellone. This was the important union, infusing European aristocracy with Davidic lineage, by which occult societies, and books like the Holy Blood Holy Grail , have claimed represented the secret of the Holy Grail. Coincidentally, according to Medieval Jewish legends, one Makhir, often confused with Natronai, apparently arrived in southern Franc e by the invitation of Charlemagne, who is said to have sent an embassy, in which a Jew, Isaac, took part, to ask the “king of Babel” to send him a man of royal Jewish lineage. In response, the Caliph Harun al Rashid, dispatched Rabbi Makhir to him... that Ma khir was “close to the king and all his descendants”, as meaning he was inter - related with French aristocracy, through intermarriage, was proposed by Arthur Zuckerman , in A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France. There are numerous confusing genealogies provide d as to the descent of this Makhir, or Natronai. According to the research of James Allen Dow, Natronai married one Rolinda of Aquitaine. Their sons were Makhir and Gilbert of Rouergue. Makhir married Alda, the daughter of Charles Martel... According to Zucke rman, Makhir would have assumed the Christian name of Theodoric, or Thierry, and assumed the title of King of the Jews, and ruled over the independent state of Septimania in southern France, with the city of Narbonne as its capital. In the Mediaeval, roman ces Theirry is called Aymery, and he was the father of Guillaume de Gellone, about whom there were at least six major epic poems composed before the era of the crusades. The device of his shield was the Lion of Judah. At the height of his power, he include d as part of his dominion, northeastern Spain, the Pyrenees, along with the region of Septimania. Zuckerman maintains the reference of Makhir‟s"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"descendants being “close” to those of the king should be understood to mean “inter - related”, or that Guillaume‟s ancestors intermarried with those of the Carolingians. The Sinclairs The Sinclairs, like all Norman nobility, were also descended from the Viking, Rollo Ragnvaldsson and Poppa of Bavaria. Charles the Simple, King of France, met Rollo at the castle of St. Clair, and there made him Duke of Normandy. The Sinclairs soon multiplied to such an extent that they could not all stay at the castle of St. Clair, and were given various other castles around France. However, they all went to England with the Conqueror. One Sinclair, named W illiam, did not like the Conqueror, his cousin, so with some other discontented barons, he went to Scotland. W illiam St. Clair, like William the Conqueror, and Alain IV of Brittany, were descended from Conan I of Brittany. The two W ill iams were the grandsons of Emma of Normandy‟s brother, Richard II “the Good” of Normandy, and Judith of Brittany, the daughter of Conan I of Brittany and Ermangard of Anjou. The Templars of Scotland Robert the Bruce claimed the Scottish throne as a great - great - greatgreat grandson of David. He was also a descendant of Robert the Brus II, who married William St. Clair‟s sister Agnes. Robert the Bruce was also the grandson of W alter Stewart, 3rd High Stewart of Scotland. W alter Stewart, the sixth High Steward of Scotland, played an important part in the Battle of Bannockburn. W alter Stewart then married Majory, daughter of Robert the Bruce, and their son Robert II, eventually inherited the Scottish throne after his uncle David II of Scotland died. From them we re descended all subsequent Stewart, or Stuart, kings of Scotland. Rosslyn Chapel There are hundreds of stone carvings in the walls and in the ceiling of the Rosslyn Chapel, which represent biblical scenes, Masonic symbols, and examples of Templar iconogr aphy. There are swords, compasses, trowels, squares and mauls with images of the Solomon‟s Temple. In addition to the Jewish and occult symbolism, there are also some traces of Islam and pagan serpents, dragons, and woodland trees. The fertility figure of the Green Man, a European version of the dying - god Dionysus, is to be found everywhere on the pillars and arches, together with fruits, herbs, leaves, spices, flowers, vines and the plants of the garden paradise...The remains of William St Clair, great - grand father of the founder of Rosslyn Chapel, are said to be buried in Rosslyn, in the style of the Templars, in a grave marked by a skull and crossbones.

Between October 13, 1307 and January 8, 1308, the Templars went unmolested in England. During this period many fugitive Templars, seeking to escape torture and execution, fled to apparent safety there. Although, after the intercession of Pope Clement V, King Edward II ordere d the seizure of members of the order in England on January 8, 1308. Only handfuls of Templars were duly arrested however.

Who Was Minerva? ...daughter of Jupiter, patroness of health, learning, and wisdom - Bulfinch's Mythology (Glossary) The Roman goddess Minerva was based on the Greek Athena, who, in turn, was based on earlier Egyptian goddesses such as Isis and Neith. These goddesses were, in turn, based on earl ier W estern antetypes. They were described as \"virginal\" and were commonly depicted with fair complexions. They were the mothers of the various sun gods. Most of the Eastern goddesses who turn up in Greek and Roman pantheons were based on the Aryan goddess es Danu, Ana and Brigit. One perfect example is Hera, the supreme goddess of the Greeks. She was based on Eri, goddess of Ireland. (See Chapter Ten, The Disciples of Horus , for more on this subject.) Minerva was the Roman name of Greek goddess Athena. She was considered to be the virgin goddess of warriors, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, crafts, and the inventor of music - Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia (Entry on Minerva) In Sais the statue of Athena whom they believe to be Isis, bore the mysterious ins cription: \"I am all that has been, and is, and shall be, and my robe no mortal has yet uncovered\" - Plutarch Minerva's Birth Minerva (Pallas, Athene), the goddess of wisdom, was the offspring of Jupiter, without a mother.

Some schol ars believe the word Sulis comes from the Indo - European Sewel , which meant \"sun.\" Minerva was undoubtedly a version of Baratana, and the the primordial Irish goddess Brigid. Scholars accept that she is closely connected to the Celtic Brigantia. The Christi an Saint Brigid of Kildare was also based on the early Irish goddess. (See sources section below for more on these goddesses.) Minerva the Virgin Not only was Minerva \"immaculately\" conceived (being without a mother), but she was also a virginal goddes s. If we examine the name of Athena, we shall, perhaps, be able to paint a picture soberer in colouring but nearer to the facts. The longer form of Athena's name, Athenaia, is simply a feminine adjective, she - of - Athens, the maiden of Athens. The Hymn addre sses her as \"Pallas, our Lady of Athens.\" This other name, Pallas, simply means virgin. If the claim of Hera to maidenhood is shadowy, it is not so with Athena. She is maiden through and through, and her temple is rightly called the maiden - sanctuary, the P arthenon - Jane Harrison ( Myths of Greece and Rome ) Related Goddesses The Roman Minerva was a composite deity. She is either identical with, or mythologically related to, the following goddesses of antiquity: Menrva (Etruscan) Pallas Athena (Greek) Neith ( Egypt) Ma'at (Egypt) Brigantia (Britain) Brigid (Ireland) Baratana (Britain) Victoria (Roman) Nike (Roman) Vacuna (Roman) Pallas Athena The word Pallas means \"virginal.\" Minerva was, therefore, both immaculately conceived and virginal. For the Greeks Palla s Athena symbolized man's reason. She assisted Prometheus in his plot to steal \"fire\" (knowledge) from the gods to give to men.

The spine was misshapen so it couldn't stand upright and the head was placed in an unbalan ced position too far forward. Boule's model of Neanderthal man was placed on display in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago for 44 years before the mistakes were discovered! After the mistakes were disclosed, they kept it on display for another 20 years until they created a new Neanderthal model. W hat did they do with the old inaccurate model?

The broken upper jaw - bone a nd intact skull from humanlike creatures, or hominids, are described in Nature. Previously, the hominid Homo habilis was thought to have evolved into the more advanced Homo erectus , which evolved into us. Now, habilis and erectus are thought to be sister species that overlapped in time. The new fossil evidence reveals an overlap of about 500,000 years during which Homo habilis and Homo erectus must have co - existed in the Turkana basin area, the region of East Africa where the fossils were unearthed."},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"\"Thei r co - existence makes it unlikely that Homo erectus evolved from Homo habilis,\" said co - author Professor Meave Leakey, palaeontologist and co - director of the Koobi Fora Research Project. The jaw bone was attributed to Homo habilis because of its distinctiv e primitive dental characteristics, and was dated to around 1.44 million years ago. It is the youngest specimen of this species ever found. The skull was assigned to the species Homo erectus despite being a similar size to that of a habilis skull. Most oth er erectus skulls found have been considerably larger. But it displayed typical features of erectus such as a gentle ridge called a \"keel\" running over the top of the jaw joint. Analysis showed the skull to be about 1.55 million years old. The new dates in dicate that the two species must have lived side by side. Sister species If Homo erectus had evolved from habilis and stayed within the same location then both must have been in direct competition for the same resources. Eventually, one would have out - c ompeted the other. \"The fact that they stayed separate as individual species for a long time suggests that they had their own distinct ecological niches, thus avoiding direct competition,\" Professor Leakey explained. Professor Chris Stringer, head of hum an origins at London's Natural History Museum, said: \"Both were apparently stone tool - makers, but one possibility is that the larger and perhaps more mobile erectus species was an active hunter, while habilis scavenged or caught small prey.\" It is most l ikely that both species evolved from a common ancestor. Other possibilities But the linear, ancestor - descendent relationship between the two species cannot be ruled out altogether. Fred Spoor, professor of developmental biology at University College Londo n, and co - author of the paper, told the BBC News website: \"It's always possible that Homo habilis lived, let's say, 2.5 million years ago and then in another part of Africa, away from the Turkana basin, an isolated population evolved into Homo erectus .\" After a sufficient amount of time to allow both species to develop different adaptations and lifestyles, Homo erectus could have then found its way to the"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"Turkana basin. W ith separate \"ecological niches\", both species could co - exist without direct competi tion for resources. \"But that is a much more complex proposition,\" Professor Spoor explained, \"the easiest way to interpret these fossils is that there was an ancestral species that gave rise to both of them somewhere between two and three million years a go.\" Not so similar The fossil record indicates that modern humans ( Homo sapiens ) evolved from Homo erectus . However, to some researchers, the small size of the erectus skull suggests that species may not have been as similar to us as we once thought. On average, modern humans display a low level of \"sexual dimorphism\", meaning that males and females do not differ physically as much as they do in other animals. The scientists compared the small skull to a much larger erectus cranium found previously in Tanzania. If the size difference between the two is indicative of the larger one being from a male and the smaller being from a female, it suggests that erectus displayed a high level of sexual dimorphism - similar to that of modern gorillas. Sexual dimorp hism can relate to reproductive strategies and sexual selection. If erectus was very sexually dimorphic it may have had multiple mates at a time. This differs from the more monogamous nature of modern humans, indicating that Homo erectus was not as human - l ike as once thought. The researchers dismiss the idea that the small size of the skull could be a result of it belonging to a youngster. \"By studying how the skull bones are fused together we discovered it belonged to a fully grown young adult rather than a developing juvenile erectus,\" said Professor Spoor. ◊ ◊ ◊ Darwinists Squirm Under Spotlight (An Interview with Phillip E. Johnson) This article is reprinted from an interview with Citizen Magazine, January 1992. Phillip Johnson has been a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley for more than 20 years. As an academic lawyer, one of Johnson's specialties is \"analyzing the logic of arguments and identifying the assumptions that lie behind those arguments.\" A few years ago he began to suspect that Darwinism, far from being an objective fact, was little more than a philosophical position dressed up as science -- and poor science at that. Wanting to see whether his initial impression was correct, Johnson decided to take a closer look at the arguments, evidence and assumptions underlying contempora ry Darwinism. The result of his investigation is Darwin on Trial,"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"a controversial new book that challenges not only Darwinism but the philosophical mindset that sustains it. When did you first become aware that Darwinism was in trouble as a scientific theo ry? I had been vaguely aware that there were problems, but I'd never had any intention of taking up the subject seriously or in detail until the 1987 - 88 academic year, when I was a visiting professor in London. Every day on the way to my office I happened to go by a large bookstore devoted to science. I picked up one book after another and became increasingly fascinated with the obvious difficulties in the Darwinist case -- difficulties that were being evaded by tricky rhetoric and emphatic repetition. I then began delving into the professional literature, especially in scientific journals such as Nature and Science. At every step, what I found was a failure of the evidence to be in accord with the theory. What was it that initially made you suspect that Darwi nism was more philosophy than hard science? It was the way my scientific colleagues responded when I asked the hard questions. Instead of taking the intellectual questions seriously and responding to them, they would answer with all sorts of evasions and v ague language, making it impossible to discuss the real objections to Darwinism. This is the way people talk when they're trying very hard not to understand something. Another tip - off was the sharp contrast I noticed between the extremely dogmatic tone tha t Darwinists use when addressing the general public and the occasional frank acknowledgments, in scientific circles, of serious problems with the theory. For example, I would read Stephen Jay Gould telling the scientific world that Darwinism was effectivel y dead as a theory. And then in the popular literature, I would read Gould and other scientific writers saying that Darwinism was fundamentally healthy, and that scientists had the remaining problems well under control. There was a contradiction here, and it looked as though there was an effort to keep the outside world from becoming aware of the serious intellectual difficulties. What are some of the intellectual difficulties? Can you give an example? The most important is the fossil problem, because this is a direct record of the history of life on earth. If Darwinism were true, you would expect the fossil evidence to contain many examples of Darwinian evolution. You would expect to see fossils that really couldn't be understood except as transitions betwe en one kind of organism and another. You would also expect to see some of the common ancestors that gave birth to different groups like fish and reptiles. You wouldn't expect to find them in every case, of course. It's perfectly reasonable to say that a gr eat deal of the fossil evidence has been lost. But you would continually be finding examples of things that fit well with the theory."},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"In reality, the fossil record is something that Darwinists have had to explain away, because what it shows is the sudden appearance of organisms that exhibit no trace of step - by - step development from earlier forms. And it shows that once these organisms exist, they remain fundamentally unchanged, despite the passage of millions of years - and despite climatic and environmental changes that should have produced enormous Darwinian evolution if the theory were true. In short, if evolution is the gradual, step - by - step transformation of one kind of thing into another, the outstanding feature of the fossil record is the absence of ev idence for evolution. But isn't it possible, as many Darwinists say, that the fossil evidence is just too scanty to show evidence of Darwinian evolution? The question is whether or not Darwinism is a scientific theory that can be tested with scientific evi dence. If you assume that the theory is true, you can deal with conflicting evidence by saying that the evidence has disappeared. But then the question arises, how do you know it's true if it isn't recorded in the fossils? Where is the proof? It's not in g enetics. And it's not in the molecular evidence, which shows similarities between organisms but doesn't tell you how those similarities came about. So the proof isn't anywhere, and it's illegitimate to approach the fossil record with the conclusive assumpt ion that the theory is true so that you can read into the fossil record whatever you need to support the theory. If Darwinism has been so thoroughly disconfirmed, why do so many scientists say it's a fact? There are several factors that explain this. One is that Darwinism is fundamentally a religious position, not a scientific position. The project of Darwinism is to explain the world and all its life forms in a way that excludes any role for a creator. And that project is sacred to the scientific naturali st - to the person who denies that God can in any way influence natural events. It's also an unfortunate fact in the history of science that scientists will stick to a theory which is untrue until they get an acceptable alternative theory - which to a Darwinis t means a strictly naturalistic theory. So for them, the question is not whether Darwinism is true. The question is whether there is a better theory that's philosophically acceptable. Any suggestion that Darwinism is false, and that we should admit our ign orance about the origin of complex life - forms, is simply unacceptable. In their eyes, Darwinism is the best naturalistic theory, and therefore effectively true. The argument that it's false can't even be heard. Surely there are some skeptics in the scienti fic world. What of them? Well, there are several, and we can see what happened to them. You have paleontologist Colin Patterson, who's quoted in my first chapter. He made a very bold statement, received a lot of vicious criticism, and then pulled back. Thi s is a typical pattern. Another pattern is that of Stephen Jay Gould, who said that Darwinism is effectively dead as a general theory - and then realized that he had given a powerful weapon to the creationists, whose existence"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"cannot be tolerated. So now Gou ld says that he's really a good Darwinist, and that all he really meant was that Darwinism could be improved by developing a larger theory that included Darwinism. What we have here is politics, not science. Darwinism is politically correct for the scienti fic community, because it enables them to fight off any rivals for cultural authority. Darwinists often accuse creationists of intolerance. But you're suggesting that the Darwinists are intolerant? If you want to know what Darwinist science is really like, read what the Darwinists say about the creationists, because those things - regardless of whether they're true about the creationists - are true about the Darwinists. I've found that people often say things about their enemies that are true of themselves. And I think Darwinist science has many of the defects that the Darwinists are so indignant about when they describe the creationists. Across the country, there has been a growing trend toward teaching evolution as a fact - especially in California, your own st ate. What does this say about science education in America? This is an attempt to establish a religious position as orthodox throughout the educational establishment, and thus throughout the society. It's gone very far. The position is what I call \"scienti fic naturalism.\" The scientific organizations, for example, tell us that if we wish to maintain our country's economic status and cope with environmental problems, we must give everyone a scientific outlook. But the \"scientific outlook\" they have in mind i s one which, by definition, excludes God from any role in the world, from the Big Bang to the present. So this is fundamentally a religious position - a fundamentalist position, if you like -- and it's being taught in the schools as a fact when it isn't even a good theory. Why should Christians be concerned about a scientific theory? Why does it matter? Well, not only Christians should care about it. Everyone should. It is religion in the name of science, and that means that it is misleading people about both r eligion and science.

The Secret Founding of America The S ecret Founding of America , by Nicholas Hagger, was published in 2007. It is one of the first \"mainstream\" books to deal with the Freemasons and the Illuminati and their role in the founding of America. The author is an academic historian who has written over twenty books on history, literature and philosophy. He has written for the Times of London. The hardback edition, which appears to h ave been targeted toward a mainstream audience, is well worth reading. The publishers saw to it that the book was released in time for the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown Landings. Among the \"conspiracy\" authors getting a mention by Hagger in the sourc es section are Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln ( Holy Blood, Holy Grail ), Nesta W ebster ( Secret Societies and Subversive Movements ), Lady Queensborough ( Occult Theocracy ), Carroll Quigley ( Tragedy and Hope ), Stephen Knight ( The Brotherhood ), and Ralph Epperson ( The Unseen Hand ). In a previous work entitled The Syndicate (2004) Hagger references other notable authors and researchers, such as G. Edward Griffin. W e believe that this type of book, which delves into secret societies, and which is written by a academ ic, is among the first of many to come. So - called \"conspiratorial\" subjects are becoming popular and more and more people are asking vexatious and penetrating questions about history and about where mankind is heading. Humanity's skepticism is increasing a nd people are clearly not as content as they once were just going along believing what they have been told about history and the world from conventional sources. This turning of the tide has not gone unnoticed by the powers that be. In the past the establ ishment moved to silence authors and suppress literature that exposed the dirty big secrets of religion and politics. To a certain extent such suppression still goes on. However, the establishment has begun to use"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"another tactic. It has begun, ever so grad ually, to co - opt overtly controversial subject matter. The new tactic has been adopted because the power - brokers have finally realized that they cannot wholly suppress truth. Lately, they appear to have decided to present controversial information in a san itized form by way of writers under their control and from inside institutions of their making. The work of these authors poses no major threat whatsoever. Their sanitized ideas concerning the evils of the status quo can safely be presented to the masses. This strategy is effective. It ensures that real teachers remain suppressed or in the background. It is their hard - earned information that is craftily taken and artfully packaged and presented before the world by the mainstream publishers and media oracles . The men who sweated for that information, who died poor, whose lives were endangered, and whose reputations were wrecked, remain largely unknown while the affluent and compliant academics, possibly hand - picked for the job and made to appear edgy and cont roversial, are promoted. They succeed and enjoy the media limelight. It is sad that so many great works on par with or superior to The Secret Founding of America are out of print or hard to find. It is sad that Americans may live out their lives without k nowing the names of the great literary patriots who labored so hard against unimaginable odds to get the message out about the dangers of Zionism and Fascism, and about subjects such as Freemasonry and the \"New W orld Order\" of the secret societies, who now own and control the United States of America. In light of this dearth of information, we recommend both of Nicholas Hagger's excellent books - The Secret Founding of America and The Syndicate. W e support and reference any book, movie, or documentary that succeeds in getting over to people the truth about their religious, political and financial institutions, and about the camera - shy personalities working behind the scenes of world affairs. Hagger expresses in a clear and concise manner how Freemasonry and Templarism insinuated itself into American political and social life. His book contains information that reinforces our long held belief concerning the complicity of Benjamin Franklin.

The Elizabethan landed values introduced by the 1607 planters had a new form, as feudal serfs called slaves were now tied to the land.

Bacon and the other dignitaries men tioned throughout Hagger's book, served Masonry and Templarism regardless of whether they were nationally English, Spanish, French, or American.

Etymology : Key to the Past Introduction Cities may burn, floods may destroy, pestilence may kill, and wars may ravage, yet a word may survive – Henry Binkley Stein ( Thirty Thousan d Gods Before Jehovah ) This section introduces the subject of Etymology, which concerns the various meanings, both denotative and connotative, of words . Etymology is one of the most important subjects to learn about. The Book of Genesis opens with the li ne - \" In the beginning was the word.... \" There is a certain humor here. Perhaps the author added the line with a sly wink since, after all, it is his word that begins the book, and not God's. Indeed, all books open with words, just as all human thoughts ar e sooner or later put into words, in one language or another. W ords are magical. They are the heart and soul of magic and science. The ancient Druids knew the power of words and of the wordsmith. To the Druid, all magical practices were dependant on the w ords, tone, and language used in their execution. Language was the means by which one adept passed on the details of the magical canon. W hen we remember the debt we owe to Homer, Shakespeare, and Cervantes, let us also remember the debt these masters owed to words and letters. Although the poet may be the prince, the word is emperor. Among the ideas which were borrowed by Judaism from the Persian religion belonged those connected with the mediatory ―Word.‖ As the creative power of the Godhead upon earth, t he expression ―the Word‖ had already appeared in aphoristic literature. Under Greco - Egyptian influence the term ―wisdom‖ (sophia) had become a naturalized expression for it – Arthur Dewes ( The Christ Myth ) Nowadays words have largely lost their magical qua lities. The shallowness of today's \"swing\" languages mirror the shallowness and artificiality of human thought and lifestyle. At least this is the case for unawakened human beings. It is certainly not the case for the rulers of mankind, the overlords who c an't afford to forget the power of the words they so artfully employ. It is by way of the magical power of words that their cruel antihuman hegemonies are gained and maintained. The \"Hitlers\" of the world are orators first and foremost, even though the wor ds they speak may be composed by more shadowy figures pulling the strings. By gaining control over words they gain control of the world."},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"Literacy in the ancient world was mastered by a very small part of any given society. Small farmers and shepherds had n o use for writing, nor did the local patrons and strong men who typically controlled the small patronates...Imperial governments, however, did have use for it – Thomas L. Thompson ( The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel ) This peculiar liability of men to be deceived by words and names when they are presented in disguised and abbreviated, or unfamiliar, forms of spelling has been taken full advantage of by the obscurantists, who have in some ways secreted and in other ways suppressed th e history of the past ages - Conor MacDari ( The Bible: An Irish Book ) ◊ ◊ ◊ Monogenesis The Root Language In their excellent book entitled Civilization One: The World is Not As You Thought It Was , the authors Alan Butler and Christopher Knight, consider the possibility of the great parent language from which the majority of others may have descended. In the 18th century the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz suggested that all ancient and modern languages diverged from protolanguage. This idea, called 'monogenesis,' sounds very odd but it is taken very seriously by many leading scholars. Anthropologist and writer Richard Rudgely has said the consequences of acknowledging a root language are mind - boggling. Such a language must be more than 10,000 years old and probably nearer to 15,000 years old. It is amazing that c orrespondences in language exist as far afield as the deserts of southern Africa, the Amazon rainforest, the Arctic and Europe. Linguist and writer Merrit Ruhlen has called the ancient original language, 'Proto - Global.' ...academics as revered as Lord Coli n Renfrew, Disney Professor of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge, have concluded that every group of humans in the world once spoke the same language - and that the date of this convergence was as recent as 15,000 years ago. These experts follow the pattern of words that are shared by peoples who have no known connection, yet they stop short of asking how such a thing can be true. Surely, if everyone spoke the same language there must have been a high level of regular contact between peoples aroun d the world, at a time when, in the modern comprehension of prehistory, this would have been impossible.

One of the easiest and most effective ways to promote a deception is by the misspelling of words...In the translation from the original Irish scriptures, the Irish names were changed by the practice of the most astute cunning in ord er to conceal the source from which they were obtained. In many instances these names have been distorted and misspelled to such an extent that it has required long sustained and patient effort to trace them to their true and proper form - Conor MacDari ( T he Bible: An Irish Book ) As we have shown in The Irish Origins of Civilization, the mythmongers have worked hard to prevent the facts concerning the western Arya from being widely known. They have deliberately and expertly manipulated names, titles, and wo rds, to make sure that the secret of their own religious roots never come to light. Their flagrant abuse of terms and words is but one more crime to be added to the catalogue of their violence. Fortunately, when it comes to words, we find that it is mostly vowels that interchange. For the most part, consonants remain as they are. Moreover, ancient written languages such as Greek, Egyptian, and Hebrew, did not use vowels. In short, words, personal names, and place names, often preserve fascinating informatio n about the world we live in. They are especially revealing when it comes to the world of the past. Because of this, many place names and words have been deliberately altered. Because of this desecration, they are bound to be misinterpreted. For instance, the ancient name of India was Bharat. This was the name of an ancient goddess who was worshiped the world over. Another important goddess was known as Ana. W hen the two goddess names are combined we have Baratana. This is where the name of Britain originat ed. In fact, the symbol of Baratana sitting on a throne with a shield bearing the Union Jack is a familiar emblem for Britain. Speaking of the Ari or Aryans, we find this root (and its derivatives) in place names such as Saqqara, Benares, and Lohara. In Ea stern lands the true meaning of these roots is well known. Easterners know they refer to the great W estern civilizers and their priesthood. Informed Easterners know that these ancient W esterners were visitors and not invaders, as duplicitous historians hav e long insisted. W ords such as Galilee, Bengal, Golan, Samaria, Jordan, Sumeria, Sahara, Bulgaria, Gadara, Arabia, Armenia, Amarna, Iran, Karachi, Kandahar, Kaspari (Kashmir), Syria, Mallewi, Tyre, Tarim, Barragh (in Scotland), Bharat (India),"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"and Batum (i n Georgia), feature W estern roots. Benares and Bengal, for instance, bear the root ben, meaning \"hill\" or \"high place.\" Benares, therefore, means \"hill of the Arya.\" Bengal means \"hill of the Gals.\" The word Gal indicates the Gaels, which probably refers t o Irish and Nordic migrants (or later Scythian tribes) who made their way from Europe into Pakistan and India. The Gaels brought their skills, teachings and ways to the Eastern lands. They specialized in languages. The Irish legends mention the network of Scythian colleges and mystery schools that stretched from Europe to the East. The masters of these colleges, the great adepts, were regarded as demigods. The Gaels (Milesians and Scythians, etc) were not the first W esterners to traverse the East. Long befo re their time the Megalithic Irish had already visited India and Egypt. The Druids influenced the ancient Egyptian Amenists and had lived on the Nile and in the Indus Valley region over 10,000 years before the Christian era. Skeptics who can't accept this fact know precious little about ancient history. They have accepted the unsustainable lies taught to them in schools and colleges. They accept that in the Victorian Age, before the Crimean W ar of 1853, Russian intelligence officers and troops could make th eir way on horseback into Pakistan and India. But, ironically, they consider it preposterous that Vikings from Sweden and Norway, who had once conquered Russia all the way to the southern Volga, and to the Black and Caspian Seas, could also manage to make their way further east? The evolution of Punjabi from the original Aryan speech, of which Sanskrit is the best representative extant, has followed exactly the same rules of transformation, as governed the evolution of modern Teutonic and Roman languages f rom the parent speech. The main Teutonic languages are German, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and English and owe their birth to a common source. The family of Romance languages includes French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian. They are more o r less direct descendants of Latin. Both old Teutonic and Latin, along with Slavonic, Armenian and Sanskrit, are believed to have originated from a common parent speech, called by German scholars, the Ursprache - Professor Om Parkash Kahol (sikhiwiki.org: Entry on Punjabi and Sanskrit) In time the truth will emerge revealing that the Tarim Basin, Pamir Region, Hindu Kush, and Indus Valley, as well as other regions East and West of the Himalayas, were homes of W estern races. The fact is not disputed by intel lectuals of the East. It is only modern day W esterners who have been egregiously deceived about history. It is surely pertinent that almost all traditions which refer to culture - heroes...describe them as white, tall, bearded, and invariably superior to the a boriginal peoples among whom they appeared — often suddenly — to impart laws, crafts and useful information - D. S. Allan and J. B. Delair ( When the Earth Nearly Died )"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"HEBREW The word 'Ibri, \"Hebrew,\" occurs some thirty times in the Bible, a small number compared with the 2,500 appearances of \"Israel.\" The two terms are not synonymous - Joseph Meleze Modrzejewski ( The Jews of Egypt: From Rameses II to Emperor Hadrian ) The word Hebrew did not relate to a particular race but to the wise ones or Elders known as the Ibaru or Ibri of Ireland, and later, of Egypt. The ancient name for the land of Ireland was Hibernia , and the ancient Irish were known as Hibernians. This is a Irish word and it also denoted those Gaelic tribes, descended from the ancient Irish, w hich temporarily inhabited Spain. Spain's old name was Iberia. In short, the original Hebrews were Elders from the land of Ireland. They were an ancient caste of high adepts who venerated the stars and the zodiac and who had stellar churches and centers of learning throughout the world. In Eastern lands, they, and their disciples, were commonly court instructors. They served as educators and advisers to a great many foreign kings and princes. They were counselors to the pharaohs. In the Old Testament tale o f the patriarch Joseph who, allegedly, rose from the status of jail bird to adviser of the pharaoh, we see a corrupted vestige of the reality we speak of. From modern researches, we can even go so far as to speculate that these Ibaru were themselves pharao hs in the land Egypt. New revelations confirm and reinforce the theories of the world's past geniuses, men such as Sigmund Freud, Comyns Beaumont, and Conor MacDari. The word Ibaru is the origin of \"Hebrew.\" The letter \"H\" often meant the same things as th e English \"the\" or French \"le.\" Hebrew was more likely \"the Ebaru,\" or \"the Ibaru.\" In our view, this term has been deliberately misinterpreted. This is because of the similarity between the words Ibaru and Apiru , (or in Egyptian Apir ). The word Apiru can be found in Sumerian, Assyrio - Babylonian, and Egyptian texts. It referred to a wanderer, an immigrant, or an undesirable person or group of people. It was used to denote people living within the borders of a sovereign country but who had become a disturba nce or nuisance, and who were not wanted. Apiru may have come from the root abr (or obr ) which refers to \"passers - by\" or \"travelers,\" or those without a homeland. Apiru is also thought to have referred to farmers or shepherds. This connotation allowed some scholars to connect the Hebrews with the \"Hyksos\" people of Egypt. There is great debate over the origins of the Hyksos and there is little consensus among scholars regarding their true identity. For more than a hundred years, orientalists have likened th e word 'Ibri to the terms 'Apiru, found in Egyptian texts, and Habiru, its cuneiform equivalent. These terms, signifying \"dusty\" or \"dust - covered,\" apply to western Semitic populations spread over a vast territory, extending from Egypt to Mesopotamia; they were semi - nomads roaming around the fringes of the desert, on the marches of sedentary society. Their"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"identity is obscure; it may be approximated by an anthroponymic reference to a national divinity, 'Apir - Baal, \"the dusty one of Baal,\" or 'Apir - El, \"the dusty one of El.\" By vigorously sifting the \"dust\", these marginal people could occasionally be put to use and absorbed into the local population as workers or soldiers. But \"civilized\" society still looked upon them with fear and distrust - Joseph Meleze Modrzejewski ( The Jews of Egypt: From Rameses II to Emperor Hadrian ) In Egyptian the word Eebre , (Hebrew Eber ) referred to rivers and to water. The reference here was most probably to the Nile, and to the schools of the Hebrew which existed along that grea t river. W ith the \"H\" added to the beginning of the word, we have \"the Eber,\" that is, \"the men of the river.\" Rivers were always considered sacred to the ancients, and were connected to esoteric knowledge. The Rhine river, for instance, takes its name fro m the Germanic word Rune, meaning \"sacred knowledge,\" or \"source of wisdom.\" Men of the River, therefore, referred to those of the \"Underground Stream\" of hermetic knowledge. In the Papyrus of Hunefer in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, we see Osiris enthron ed upon the sacred river, or pool of water, from which arises the papyrus plant with the four sons of Horus. A famous papyri on healing from Egypt is known as the Eber Papyrus . STAR A very important term in the ancient world. The word, and the symbol of th e star, was used as a title to distinguish high level adepts and initiates of \"Judaic\" cults and sects. The Queen of Sheba , for instance, meant \"Queen of the Star.\" The so - called \"Star of David,\" is really the star of the Hyksos Dynasty of kings in Egypt, that history knows as the Israelites. The word david, is the true translation of the syllable tut , which was itself a pharaonic title. The name \"Tuthmosis\" was adopted by at least five solar cult pharaohs, and the name of the famous Tutankhamen also bears this syllable or title. The word star in Egyptian was \"saba .\" This is where the term \"sabean\" comes from, meaning \"of the heavens\" or \"stars.\" This term \"saba\" can also be rendered in several other ways, for example seb, seba, sheba, sava, seba, seva, zeba , and so on. The English word \"star ,\" and Latin word \"aster\" both derives from the Egyptian original. The names of certain deities such as Sobek, Sebekh, Set, and Shiva, probably derive from this syllable that referred to the stars and to the master astrol ogers. The head of the Essenes at Qumran near the Dead Sea, bore the title \"Star,\" and Jesus, allegedly in his own words, identifies himself with the \"bright and morning star.\" The word saba, or seba, is the root of the the modern word \"seven.\" The number seven indentified members of the Stellar Cult. W e note that there are seven candlesticks on a Jewish menorah. In short, the title and appellation \"Star\" denoted a messiah or Christ figure, a great spiritual or political leader. Today, we find the image of the star"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"emblazoned on the regalia of the popes and archbishops and on innumerable churches, cathedrals, and temples throughout the western world. An examination of the following words reveals the syllable denoting the star. Ashtaroth Astarte Ishtar Tarot Taurus Zoroaster Other important words containing this syllable are the following: PASTOR Here is a word commonly u sed by persons in the Christian religion, in reference to someone with clerical duties. The word has two syllables, Pa and Stor . The first s yllable is the root of the word for father, elder and great. The latter stands for Star . This is where we derive the word aster , and asteroid , meaning \"star.\" The vowels often replace one another as a word passes down and is pronounced by different culture s. The word pastor , translates as great or father star. The great star is, of course, the sun, the great star in the heavens. It may also relate to Saturn, which was the supreme \"star\" of the ancient Cult of Saturn. Now in the ti me of the Saturnian Cult th e color black was worn by the holy ones, because as astrologers know, the planet Saturn and the domicile Capricorn, are connected with the color black and the metal lead. Followers of the ancient Cult of Saturn or of EL, knew that it had rings around it. T he white ring around the collar of the Pastor, and the black robe that he dons, are direct references to the Cult of EL or Saturn. EL worshippers had their days and calendars begin at 12 midnight and held their convocations on the day of Saturn (Saturday), as opposed to the later Solar Cult that worshipped on the Sun‟s day (Sunday). Now the planet Saturn was worshipped because it was the planet that had the rings around it. This is where we get the image of the magician standing in a protecting circle, usua lly containing planetary sigils. It is why the magistrate, in a court, sits in a half circle. It is why when one comes to be married a wedding ring is worn. It is why the monks shaved their heads in a ring, why the Jews who worship on the day of Saturn, we ar the yarmulke and why the Pope also wears it. It is why the yogi joins his thumb and middle digit together, to signify mastery over the forces of karma and time. It is why ambassadors upon entrance to a foreign court, would draw around themselves an imag inary circle to indicate neutrality. It is why Kings wear crowns. This very word, as well as coronet, comes from corona and Cronos . Cronos was the Greek version of Saturn. In fact, the Kings would often wear the ring of authority or power due to this relat ion to the planet Saturn. It is the reason why women wear the earrings, as they were told"},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"to listen to their god Saturn. It is where the idea for the spiritualizing halo came from, that one sees throughout religious art. The ancient name of Saturn was, as mentioned, EL . It is the reason why those that were chosen by EL, were called Elites . In fact the words, Elect, Elder, Elevated, Elohim, Temple, Circle, Gospel, Apostle, Disciple, Evangelists , etc, all derive from the Cult of EL. Angels are messengers of g od. But god was EL , which is why we have the names of the Archangels bearing the \"el,\" suffix - Raphael, Michael, Uriel, Gabriel, etc. It is where the idea came from to ring a bell in order to summon people to worship. Many place names contain the prefix o r suffix EL (see Elstree, meaning EL's Tree ). Understanding of modern religion can never be complete without a comprehension of this great cult as its symbols permeate all areas of religious and even secular life. A look at corporate logos symbols makes it clear that this cult is not at all extinct. El also gives Bel, Bael, Baal and Belial. MASTER A very familiar word given to those of intelligence and merit. But its origins are again connected with the Stellar Cult. The syllables are Ma - for measure and Ster - for Star. \"measurer of the stars,\" - namely an astrologer. Children are still given a star today for successful application to their studies. When we matriculate from a university, we are given a \"Master‟s Degree.\" This is purely sabean. Degrees are part of the cycle of the zodiac. The ancients marked competence on how a person knew about celestial mathematics and the science of the heavens. The heavens are the abode of the goddess, so knowing the movements within her abode was paramount to the ancie nts. The operations of the heavenly bodies and familiarity with their \"great dance,\" was the vaunted knowledge. One was given a \"degree,\" to show that they, like the sun they were progeny of, had ascended to an exalted place. Once you had mastered the star s you were then quite literally a MASTER. The word Mas, in Persian meant moon, so master, can mean moonstar . MINISTER Another familiar term associated with the ecclesiastical profession. However, what few realize is that this word originated in or refers to the Lunar and Stellar Cults. The word min was the common name of the moon. It is where we derive the words minute and moon . And ster , is really star. So when we refer to someone as a Minister, we are really saying Moon - Star . It is a title that derives f rom the lunar and stellar cults. This explains why there is a minute hand on a watch. The three hands of a watch relate to the three planets associated with time. The slow hand is the hour hand, meaning Horus, the sun. The minute hand is for Min, the moon and the swift ticking hand is for Mercury, the planet which rotates fastest of all, both round the sun and on its own orbit. This is why the figure of the god Mercury was depicted with wings on his shoes or feet."},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"CARDINAL In Catholicism, we have the Pope a nd his Cardinals. The word is Latin for hinge. As the sun passed the great solstice and equinox points, it was said to have passed and even to have \"opened\" the doors of the Houses (astrological). The physical Pope even has rituals called the opening of th e door to the year or the millennium. Pope seems to come from Pontifex meaning \"Bridge Builder\" or from Papa , meaning the \"doorway.\" The cardinal points are a direct reference to the astrological colures. The Cardinals surround the Pope as the cardinal poi nts surround the sun. The sun casts its rays on the Houses as it passes, turning them crimson. The color worn by the physical Cardinals is red, to symbolize that they are illuminated by their proximity to the Pope, the representative of God on earth. The w ord Pope , may also be a derivative of the word in Egyptian for the evil serpent Apep, Apophis or Apopsa. (See Poop Deck , Pupa, Pepsi, Pepsid, Dr. Pepper, Sgt. Pepper, etc,). PATRIARCH Means Father or great arch. Again this connotes astrological phenomena. The great arch or arc, is the passage of the sun across the northern dome of the sky. This was revered and is why there are beautiful arches in all the cities of the world. Arches symbolize the sun‟s triumphant journey. A man who measured or observed this movement was titled - Patriarch . ARCH BISHOP Again this refers to the great journey of the sun across the northern sky. Arches or arcs are an astrological and geometric term. And Bishop is one of the oldest words we have referring to those who knew the sk y. Bishop comes from the word vishnu - god of the sea, god of the fish, and astrologically of Pisces - the sign of the fish, and of Christianity. Bishops wear the fish - headed headdress to commemorate their connection to Piscean symbolism. One of the earlie st and most important Sumerian - Babylonian gods was Oannes, the Fish - God. It is from Oannes, or Joannes, that we derive certain personal names, such as John. MONARCH Comes from the Lunar Cult, where the head potentate would be called a \"moon‟s arch,\" that is, bestowed sovereignty by the goddess of the Moon. MONSTER Has the words moon and star in it. The word was used to further denigrate those who would not adhere to the Solar Cults dominion. This demonization is the same as lunatic, sinner, harlot, whore, tart, prostitute and fallen woman. All these words were monikers for the members of all the previous cults, that resisted the dominion of the later cults. The word Hierodulai, , meaning sacred"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"woman, or beloved one, is where we get harlot . And the sacred w omen got to be sacred because they were the priestesses of the previous cults. MONSIGNOR Another person of the Cloth. The word means, Elder - Moon , or the Great Moon . MONASTERY The name given to a place where one is interned to contemplate the divine mys teries. However, the word comes from mon (moon) and aster (stars), a place of the moon and the stars. Yet when we enter into one and ask if the monks or priests there believe in astrology, you might find that you get sprinkled with holy water. People that have made a study of stained - glass windows or church architecture will have seen many secret sabean symbols. Now our banks and fast - food eateries seem to appear subliminally like churches; porticos, towers, stained - glass and all. Not that anyone has notice d. CHURCH This finds one origin in the Greek Circe , the goddess of deception who lured men into her lair and transformed them into pigs. Jordan Maxwell correctly points out that this is the same thing that is done by that which we call the physical Church . The difference is that the latter is done mostly with our consent. The actual origins of the word Church goes back to Egypt. In Scottish (Gaelic) the word for church is Kirk, a derivation of Circe. W e get the words circus and circle from this goddess nam e also. Many \"holy\" cities, shrines and precincts were designed upon the circle. (See - Saint Pauls and Saint Peters) MAGISTRATE From Hebrew aser or atsar , (close to aster and astra ), meaning \"judges,\" \"magistrates,\" and \"stars.\" The Magi were the Egyptia n star - gazers or astrologers. The black - robed judge or magistrate, like the priest, pastor, rabbi, missionary and scholar, is styled on the planet Saturn, always denotative of law and order, establishment and Karma. \"Old Father Time,\" that punishes for inf ractions of divine law. He sits three stories high and presides over the 12 lesser \"judges.\" But there is a more secret rationale behind the design of courts and the use of the number 13. The court rooms of today are analogous to the zodiac. The judge repr esents the 10th House or sign, Capricorn, he that puts a \"stop\" on you , calls you to account. In the Tarot the equivalent card is called The Devil . Also the number 13 is extremely important in occult ritual, though not for the reasons known to superstitiou s Christians and the like. It represents the Lunar year and also the 13th sign of the zodiac that is known and employed by the black deceivers. This sign called Ophiuchus, (the Serpent Bearer ), runs between Sagittarius and Capricorn. It is considered by oc cultists a neutral zone, actually out of the regular zodiac. The reason for this"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"has to do with the Galactic Center, the Black Sun , the altar of the solar system, to which everything is moving. This central sun is in the 13th sign (commonly Sagittarius). I t is considered a precinct of the zodiac removed from the other houses. This is why when one is in a Law Court, one has to pass by a gate and fence to face the 13th judge. This is why in many cathedrals, churches and synagogues, there is also a precinct be hind the altar, leading to the holy place. It is also the reason why in civic centers and government buildings there are motifs and murals on the architecture and on the floors depicting zodiacs and large black stars. These can also be seen in Masonic Hall s and on product logos. The planet Saturn can be considered a double for the black sun, as it rules Capricorn and the color black. The symbol of Saturn is perhaps the most common logo symbol used, after the sun. The swastika also went by the name of the \"B lack Sun.\" There are many corporate logos that are based on it also. The number 13 turns up in the fact that many serial killers actually murder 13 victims before they are caught. One day when people are ready to hear about the real reason for these killin gs, they will find the answers for what has been staring them in the face for decades. Many government operations, both covert and non - covert, are convened under the 13th sign, that is rituals, assassinations and inaugurals, speeches and declarations of wa r, etc. MYSTERY All the religious representatives pontificate about the \"great mystery\" that only they know how to mediate with. W hat we are not told is that the word is Egyptian for woman, namely Myst or Mesta. The mysteries are the feminine Gnosis, of the Great Mother Universe that was always personified by the Female, as was the mathematics and geometry that gave access to the secrets of Her Being. In ancient days it was noticed that the body of the female in regards the menstrual and gestative cycles, were synchronous with the movement of the Luminaries. Thus woman‟s body and the name of the goddesses, like Ma'at, became synonymous with the mysteries of the Universe. The very word \"matter,\" comes from the name of the supreme goddess of the Egyptians. T he Solar - centric ethos that came later marginalizes women for this reason. They are given no place in the inner sanctums of the modern orthodox religions because they would be privy to the cover - ups that have been perpetrated to disempowering them. As the new millennium enters we must strive to expose the machinations of the institutionalized and malign religious conclaves, which are no more than criminal organizations, that have sequestered all these truths and so many more, from the ordinary person. Not e ven a tenth of the books that have been written are available to the general public, only to those among the corrupt oligarchs of government and religion. The books are indeed privatized, but as the reader can see, we can still uncover their profound truth s through subjects like etymology."},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"SISTER Comes from the word for star and possibly the phoneme Xi (now si), meaning woman in ancient Greek. The word sissy , used as a ridicule for cowardice, comes from this. CARPENTER Refers to architects and masons, thos e initiates of sacred esoteric sects and guilds. From the Egyptian Setepenre, it was a title used by the Egyptian Pharaohs. In Greek poimen, meant the \"king's counselors.\" This gives a new light to the story of the Nativity which tells of three \"Shepherds\" visiting the newly born Jesus Christ. (See Gospel of Luke). Akhenaton referred to himself as the \"Architect,\" and this term is frequently used by Freemasons. AMEN Here we have a name from the Egyptian sidereal period, their sun - god and highest divinity. Yet we have at the end of every Christian prayer the word Amen . Amen is the sun and one of the earliest Egyptian gods. The Amenists were, we believe, confederates of the Irish Druids. Both groups were Arya. THE LETTER O (Oh) As placed in front of terms l ike God and Lord , etc. It signified the sun. In Christian churches the habit of raising the hands in front of one and in the shape of a V, comes from the ancient salute of the sun worshippers. HOLY Derives from the same root as halo, hallowed, hail and he llo, etc. All come from Helios, the sun. Halos were depicted as effulgent aureoles around the head of a saint or prophet. The halo also represents the rings of the planet Saturn. MONEY $ Comes about due to the Cult of the Moon. All money was made of eleme nts that symbolized divinity and the particular deities that the Cult was worshipping. The gold coinage was in honor of the sun, the silver coinage, the moon. Now the Lunar Cult preferred silver and this metal was more abundant. The heads or likenesses of the deity would be emblazoned on the very coins. Materialism was loathed and the means of exchange for commercial ventures was made to bear the visages of the gods as a reminder of the spiritual dimension, lest man should forget and get immersed in lower a ppetite drives. Later, kings got it into their heads, that they were gods and began putting their heads on coins and the rest is history. But the coinage and currencies got the name \"money\" from the moon as there was always much more silver coinage than go ld. Silver was connected with the moon and therefore with the Goddesses of the moon, the most famous of which was and is ISIS. So her"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"name became the symbol of money. W e find this today in the cleverly camouflaged motif - $ - which is nothing more than the sigil for the name of I - S - I - S , but fused together in an ingenious manner. The dollar sign was originally an innocuous U.S. fused together. One must ask why it was changed, or why the dollar bill is covered in the symbols common to each of the four great cu lts. The Pyramid is for the Stellar Cult, as are the various stars that appear on the bill. The Golden Eagle is for the Solar Cult. The Eagle is the symbol of America because it signifies the constellation in Scorpio called Aquila. Scorpio is the sign of p ower, money and wealth, as well as secret knowledge. (The U.S. elections are held right n the middle of Scorpio and the birthday of America is in the Scorpionic decanate of Cancer.) The color green also relates to the Solar Cult. The number thirteen, which appears frequently on the dollar bill, stands for the Lunar Cult. There are thirteen months in the Lunar Year. (America originally had thirteen States. London is made up of 28 boroughs, this being the number of the Lunar \"mansions.\") Thirteen is also a St ellar Cult numeral, much used by the Israelites and other Semitic tribes and nations. Then there are the watermarks, or \"moon letters,\" for the Lunar Cults. And the material power of money, which is supreme, in the world, relates to the Cult of Saturn. The art of money making and its design was preserved by the Huguenots, who were originally a secret society of Freemasons (see Harold Bailey's Lost Language of Symbolism, vols 1 and 2). The word mint comes from the most ancient name of the moon. Money was a a creation of occult societies. There is also much Jupiterian symbolism also on the dollar bill, in the quotations from Ovid and Virgil that are found around the pyramid. The symbol for money ($ - in America) is an old sign for bondage. It is called \"the sc ourge,\" which means a whip, but also a great and destructive pestilence. The Semitic nations brought their totemic and cultic symbols into Europe after their various \"captivities.\" It is thought that these tribes gained much of their symbolic knowledge fro m their exposure to the high cultures of Babylon and Egypt and other civilizations that are later lambasted as havens of debauchery. It should be considered interesting that in over 30,000 years of existence, Egypt never expanded its main territories or se t out to conquer any other peoples or lands. All citizens had rights and there was not a single record found relating any religious intolerance. W omen enjoyed freedoms and status that no later age would credit them, and there is no record of any sexual cri minality or abuse of women coming out of Egyptian history. MONTH This one is still well known. It refers to a full lunar period or cycle. After the joining of the great Cult, each was permitted to have a season of the year for their own, to commemorate th eir own deities and beliefs. The calibration of the year followed the movement of the sun, to keep the elites of the Solar Cult happy. The division of the next section of annual time was given to the Lunar"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":"Cult, that is, the 28 day month and the week of 7 days incorporates the sacred numbers and planets of the Stellar Cult. MONK Certainly this has to do with the moon. However, the actual monks are a product of the Saturnian Cult and their dogma. This is why they had the habit of cutting a round circle on the top of their heads. Same as the Jewish yarmulke. These signatures were analogues to the planet Saturn, with its conspicuous rings. The Christian priests wear the one white ring around their necks, above their black dresses to also commemorate Saturn. O riginally, before the solar cult strengthened their dominion, Saturday was the major day of worship for early Judeo - Christians. CEREMONY Common word that in religions indicates the time of ritual. But the name is made of two goddess names. Ceres is the Gr eek goddess of the earth, connected with harvests and Mon is moon, the Lunar - Feminine influence. In astrology the planets Venus and Moon are compatible. DEACON This may seem unfamiliar until one remembers that the word is the same as decan, the section of 10 degrees that each of the 12 houses of the zodiac are divided into. So, a Deacon or Arch - Deacon gets his name because his original duties in the time of the Stellar Cult was to watch the stars, their stations and motions. Such a personage was titled in accordance with his function. A Deacon was nothing more than an astrologer who watched the stars by night. SEXTON This may seem unconnected to the stars and heavens until we realize that it is the same as the word sextant , which is a instrument the naviga tors and astronomers use for measuring - guess what, the stars. A sexton is a man with clerical duties. So how is it that he is named after an astrologer's instrument? The reason is that before we had the modern religions, the gods were the Luminaries or a t least were represented by the Luminaries and the stars. The religion of the stars is the earliest religion, and all the subsequent religions and their doctrines are founded on it. NUN This word has also hardly changed in centuries. The earliest goddess of the Stellar period, of the primordial abyss and night sky. She was the great virgin, and was associated with the fish. The word nun means fish in Hebrew. The fish was a symbol for the geometric Vesica Piscis, which was the symbol for creation. And so, t oday, we have the \"Nuns of Christ\" who are also known as the chaste \"Brides of Christ.\" W e also derive our word noon from Nun. Noon"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"was not midday but twelve midnight, when the goddess was seen above in the night sky. The heavenly dome was her great womb a nd the planets and stars were seen as the inseminating spermatozoons or seeds within that womb. The sun was seen this way. It was the \"seed\" of God entering her womb or ovum every morning, resulting in life and fruition and abundance. It is for the same r eason why it became customary to ignite fireworks on special calendar days, to represent the seeds of light being planted within the celestial womb. This rite was to ensure a \"bright\" future. It was also to remind humanity of the disasters which befell the earth from cometary action. HOURS The word has hardly changed in centuries. It denotes the name of the sun god. Horus was portrayed as the hawk, wearing the solar disc. He was the rising sun, that flew up into the sky. In the early days when one wanted t o know what time it was, meaning where the sun was, they said, \"what Horus is it?\" (where is Horus now?). Today we say, \"what hour is it?\" ORISONS In pre - Industrial and Medieval times one did not say “I am going to say my prayers,” but my “orisons.” This word is the same as Horizon, as all Solar Cult practitioners would say their prayers to AMEN or ATON, by turning to the east, where the Sun rose. Horizon, is literally the zone of Horus, or Horus‟s Zone. Again we find a Christian word for prayers that has its roots directly in the pagan past. The purveyors of the Christian ethos, who take 7 year theology degrees, are all aware of these connections. They know the origins of their edifices all too well. The horizon is the zone of Horus, whereas on the western side we have the sunset. This term comes from the fact that the Egyptian lord of darkness, the enemy of the sun - god was called Set. So when the sun is consumed by the darkness, we call it the time of sun - set. The three stations of the sun in the sky gave rise to the original Trinity that the Christians later used for their own purposes. The word zone , is actually a derivative of the word Sun anyway. Zone becomes zon, which becomes son, or sun . W e commemorate the movement of the sun in the very act of writi ng. W e write from left to right, to emulate the movement of the sun from east to west. For without the light of the sun, there could be no writing and no knowledge. Light is the most common connotation for knowledge, e.g., enlightenment, illumined, alumni, illustrious, brilliant, scintillating, elites, pupils, etc. EASTER A long celebrated ritual period, that the Christians particularly recognize as the time of the resurrection of the son of god. W hat their illustrious seniors do not explain is that the wo rd Easter comes from the compression of the words eastern and star . The star that rises or resurrects on the spring equinoctial point is again, the sun itself and not a man.

It is because the sun has literally passed over the equinox at Aries, from the winter seasons into the new year. In fact the feast comes from the Age of Aries, which is why lamb's blood was smeared on the \"doors,\" meaning houses of the zodiac. Easter also contains the wor d aster , again meaning star. MONA Famous female name that derives from the moon. The most famous Mona is the Mona Lisa , by Leonardo Da Vinci. And many persons have spent time questioning what makes the painting so distinctive. There is something distincti ve that has missed their attentions though and that is the name Mona Lisa . The first word is an anagram for Amon (Egyptian God of the Sun) and the second is L’ isa , the goddess of the moon. So the name cryptically expresses the unification of the Luminarie s, which was always connotative of harmony and beauty. The figure in the painting is meant to symbolize the mystical Androgyny that comes about after one has conquered duality. Leonardo Da Vinci, like many around the Florentine and Venetian oligarchies, wa s a high initiate into the Stellar ethos, preserved by the Masonic Brotherhoods of the world. ATONEMENT In the Christian religion we are told to seek atonement with God and for our sins. However, what we are not told is that the word means Aton - ment, sugg esting oneness with Aton, the Semitic Adonai. Aton also gives us words like Eaton. MATRIMONY In the Christian world we have the ritual of the coming together of the male and female, under God. The term for this is, however, made from two names - Ma'at (th e goddess of order and justice, presiding over the unification of opposites whose image can still be seen above court - houses) and Mon or Min, for the moon god. Marriage is the coming together of the feminine and the masculine. MINUTE Arises from two godde ss names, Min (moon) and Nut (Nuith) both of the Stellar Cult. The former was the keeper of time as it is today. In fact the reason why a watch has three hands is to represent the three important planets associated with Astrological and sidereal temporalit y. The slow moving hour hand is for the sun (Horus), the quicker moving \"Min - Nut,\" hand is the moon‟s hand and the fast ticking hand is for Mercury, the planet that was known to spin fastest around the sun and on its own orbit. The chess - board also preserv es this. The King which can only move one square at a time is the sun, the Queen which has more latitude is the vacillating moon and the black and"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"white squares of which the board is comprised represents the day and night of the diurnal motion of the lumin aries. This and other games were created by the Stellar Cult, who also worked with the right - brain modalities of expression and comprehension. In sports today, there are three levels of competence and the symbols (medals) given to the victors have astrolog ical significance. The gold is for the sun and is the ultimate prize. The silver medal is obviously for the next luminary, the moon and the bronze symbolizes the Earth itself, as the color of earth is bronze, (or could be Mars, the \"ruddy one\"). Kings are often wearers of medallions as these also denote the sun. Generals and army personnel also wear various solar emblems. HARMONY Again these syllables preserve Sabean iconography. Har was the name of Horus as it was pronounced in Egypt. Mon is moon. Again w e have the coming together of the Luminaries, always an analogue of real Harmony . HAIL (HEIL) This is used as the salutation to the sun (see \"Heel Stone\" at Stonehenge). But the word suggestively means to conceal . And that is precisely what the sun does. Think about it !! YOUNGSTER Obviously means young star . W hen a parent saw their child they called him or her, their young star or son/sun. This is because the child god of Egypt and the beloved of the primal parents of Osiris and Isis was Horus, who was l iterally the young sun rising in the spring sky. Parents will often say of their good children, they are as \"good as gold.\" This came from the phrase, good as the Golden One , or Horus. PUPIL A word meaning the center of the eye. But it connotes the sun wh ich was always considered the pupil or eye of Horus, the sun god. The sun is the eye of day. W e speak of students as \"pupils,\" to represent the fact that wisdom and education makes one finally illumined as the sun. The word alumni connotes the same. AUM/O M This word is similar to Amun or Amon. The Irish alphabet is called the Ogham. This word is, however, pronounced \"Aum.\" The connection of words to mantras should be obvious to those who study the mysteries. As 1 is the root of number, so Aum, it is believ ed, is the root of all language. It is suggestive that the Celts seem to have recognized this fact in the naming of their alphabet. (For more on this particular subject, see the works of Nigel Pennick, Robert Graves, Charles Squire, Jim Fitzpatrick and God frey Higgins, etc.)"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"ZOROASTER Name of the august Persian mystic of the Cult of Mithras, later adopted as a patron saint by occultists. This fictitious figure is, like Christ and Moses, etc, a composite character, a personification of the sun. He was one of the first solar mystics, worshipped at the dawn of the male patriarchal cults. This is why he is still revered in the cabals of the Masonic and Rosicrucian fraternities. The Cult of Mithras would probably have been the world's most accepted religion but for the advent of Christianity, as propounded by Emperor Constantine around 400 AD. SINISTER Made from the words sin and ster . The latter means star, while the former is the most ancient name for the moon, even more used than Min. All Lunar Cult peoples referred to their goddess as Sin . This is where we derive the word Sinai , which is a mountain mentioned in the Old Testament. This region and the mountain, like all mountains, was sacred to the astronomers and star - gazers, who would always have stations an d altars on the tops of hills and mounts. W e still see the word, mount , (moon), before certain place names. Later, in the time of the patriarchal religions, all scions of the Lunar cult were rebuked and vilified. Thus we have the words sinner and lunatic a s derogatory terms. The former is so loaded with religious intonations that we cannot see its real origins. It comes from the bigoted solar cult. The remonstration in the Bible - \"go ye and sin no more,\" is not really a call for contrition, as we are told t oday. It really meant, Go and worship SIN no more, that is the moon, worship the sun instead. Sinners were not wayward Christians. They were the converted and enslaved members of previous Feminine cults. The word harlot and prostitute also referred to the same persons. These were originally the High Priestesses of the previous cults. They worshipped the natural cycles and rejoiced in the bounty of \"mother\" Earth and their credo was one of tolerance and coexistence. They worshipped the night sky as an corpor eal manifestation of the body of The Creatrix. They did not reject or repress the natural libidinous energies of the body and respected the sexual drive as a normal and productive power. W e get the word sign , from sin. The word comes from the time when we knew that the planets, like the moon, gave signs, meaning astrological intimations. W hen the moon gave rise to mantic auguries, one would say that \" Sin,\" has shown us the way, or it is a sin or I saw a sign . Now we just say it was a sign , or give us a sign . It all comes from astrology. The ancient name for India was Sindh. The Lunar Cult was very strong there. It was strong in Persia also, which is why the Islamic flags still bear the crescent moon emblem. The name of the moon is preserved in names like Cin dy. Cinderella a lunar myth, dealing with the \"Chemycal Marriage,\" amongst other things, has an entire astrological dramatis personae. In fact we still use the term \"stellar cast\" when speaking in movie jargon. It's so old it's new."},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"But the principalities that were focused on the Martian and repressive hegemony, lost no time in eradicating the Lunar Priestesses and their influence and world view. Stories like that of Sodom and Gomorrah, of the Magdalene, the \"W hore of Babylon,\" and of Jesus rejecting and re buking his mother, will suffice to help one to see propaganda instead of revelation. Or perhaps it is a revelation. But from what agency? LEBANON from labanah, meaning Lunar, of the Moon. GAELIC Comes from Gal , which is a root found in many words and pla ce names, such as Galway, Galilee, Galatia, Donegal, etc. The root denotes \"white\" or \"pure.\" It has the secondary meaning of \"foreigner,\" connoting a stranger from far away. May originate with the Sumerian, Ab - Gal, meaning \"masters of wisdom.\" CAIN Come s from the word Cahen (or Caan) , known even in the Mexicos, as meaning Serpent or Priest. Today we have Cohen . This is the Hebrew line of temple Priests. It also gives Canaan, called by the Patriarchs a land of Serpent worship. The worshippers of the Serpe nts were the Stellar or Sidereal Cult, which preceded the Solar, Lunar and Saturnian Cults. The Stellar Cult were renowned as the keepers of the great wisdom, as masters of the zodiac. This is the reason why we even hear Christ reminding his disciples to b e as \"...wise as serpents.\" However, it became imperative that the later Church Fathers utterly remove from history or theology any mention of their existence. The Indian or Persian term Khan, comes from this Can also. The place in France called Cannes, is named so because of it being a place of the Stellar Cult. It is not by chance that the film festivals are held there. Almost all the film production companies use sabean symbolism and the personages behind them, regard themselves as the new priests of the Gnosis. (See; Industrial Light and Magic, Dreamworks, Touchstone, Paramount, Columbia, Universal, Orion, Lion's Gate, Viacom, Hollywood Pictures, Tristar, MGM, RKO, CBS, Arista, Gramercy, Castle Rock, Trilogy, CTS , Cannon, Starz, FOX, Meridian , etc, etc, etc,) \"Hollywood,\" has that name for a reason. In ancient times the Druids of the Stellar Cult used to cut their magic wands from only one kind of tree. The wands were made from only one kind of wood, the wood from the Holly Tree. So we still find that th ose magi in the movie business are putting their \"spells\" on us. The makers of cinema know all about the libido, sexuality, desires and drives of the human beings that they are trying to pacify and control. The fact that \"programs\" are called \"programs\" is fascinating in itself. Programs are what one puts in a computer. They see the human mind as a computer and have been installing their virus - ridden programs every day for decades."},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"SATAN (and Lucifer) This is a word that simply meant \"one who tempts.\" It re ferred to any contradicting, skeptical, or accusatory agent and their argument. Within holy orders, like the Essenes, a \"satan\" was a detractor or opposition party. There was nothing supernatural about a satan. To oppose any hegemony, is therefore to be \"s atanic.\" So we see that there is a big difference between satan and Lucifer. Lucifer was originally based on the pagan god Mars. Later satan became identified with Mars, the red fiery planet. In the Bible we have Jesus turning to Peter and saying \"get thee behind me satan.\" If we take Jesus to be the sun, then we can take this statement to be of astro - theological significance. Mars occasionally rises heliacally, that is with or even before the sun. The priests of the sun, in the Solar - Cult, would exclaim fr om their temples \"get thee down\" or \"get thee below\" or \"get thee behind, satan,\" in order to not have their deity be ousted, rivaled and outshined. Nowhere in the Genesis account is there any mention, direct or indirect, of Satan‘s involvement, and yet i t has become common practice for the Church to portray the serpent as an emissary of Satan, or even as Satan himself - Laurence Gardner PHALLIC The treasures of Ireland, Nuada's Sword, Lugh‟s Lance, Dagda‟s Cauldron and the Stone of Fal , happen to be stri king analogues to the Tarot‟s Wand, Sword, Cup and Disk. Since the word fal means stone, the Stone of Fal literally means Stone of Stones. It was probably a powerful crystal which radiated energy. It was stolen by the Stuarts of Scotland and from there tak en by the English and is said to be under the Coronation Seat in London. One arcane story tells that the original stone was that upon which the Biblical Jacob had his dream of the ladder reaching to heaven. The stone was then brought to Ireland by the prop het Jeremiah and the Tribes of Israel - particularly that of Dan. For a study of Irish History, see: Celtic Myth and Legend, by Charles Squire.

Neter means - gods, or spirits or soul in Egyptian. This latter force was personified as a god or goddess. W e also get neuter from it. The gods were often considered sexless. The word enter is an anagram. There was no dichotomy in those days between the inner and the outer, the mind and the cosmos. Nature was God. The ancients saw themselves as literally being inside the womb of the great Universal Mot her whom they called Ma'at, Nuith or Isis. MATTER From Mahat (Sanskrit). Means the Great Flux. Comes from the Egyptian Ma'at , giving words like mother, maths, measure, meter, mate, master , etc. A \"master\" is one who is in balance, who operates in accorda nce with divine or natural law - obeying Ma'at . Measure and Mathematics arise from this Ma'at. Mankind discovered that number and geometry was inherent in the Universe due to the menstrual cycle. All number and calculation was therefore derived from and con nected to the female body, which is why the goddess was sacred, being the origin of it all. Today‟s science is possible because of the female. This is why \"math\" is a close derivation of Ma'at. The scientist forgets that the mystical traditions are therefo re as \"scientific\" as their work. Freemasons use the capitol letter \"G\" between the compass and the rule. The \"G\" was an ideogram for the throne of the goddess Isis or Ma'at. Demeter the Greek earth goddess means \"The Mater,\" or \"Mother.\" In the New Testam ent , we find a saint Matthew. He is supposed to be a \"Tax - Collector.\" The tax - collector's symbol was the Scales of Ma'at. The word mouth may also derive from Maat's name. Through the mouth, man utters the truth of Ma'at. The term in chess \"Check Mate,\" may refer to the premise of unification, justice, or order, symbolized by this ancient goddess. "},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"KABALA This is an Egyptian word. The syllables are the very names of the 2 parts of the soul, known in Egypt as the KA - Self and the BA - Self. The LA is a form of AL or EL, meaning God or One (see, Allah). These three phonemes become the first letters of the English alphabet, A, B, C, or (AA, BA, KA), The English alphabet, like the Sanskrit, Celtic and Runic, is a magickal alphabet , though this actual truth has bee n lost. The Ba is the root of ABBA (father) of KAABA (in Medina) of BABY and of the verb - To BE (to Exist). The root Ka may give the modern word - Character , and is the root of Cast , Christ (Karast), Kal (time) and Karma (Justice), etc. In Latin the word Cabalas happens to mean horse. So due to this chance association, the real Kabalists, those operating behind the scenes of government and religion, have often used as their code symbol, a black horse. This symbol is found on numerous logos as well as in ar chitecture. APOCALYPSE This word has a few interesting meanings. It connotes a leather covering that conceals or protects something. Esoterically, this refers to the human skin, or human body, that conceals the soul. In Greek the word apoko, means \"peel a way\" or \"remove,\" as in apoko olemo , or \"I peel a fruit.\" SOLOMON This clearly shows the words SOL (sun) and MON (moon). However, it also can be expressed as SOL - OM - ON, giving the name of the sun in the three sacred languages of Indo - European and Medi terranean peoples. SOL is Sumerian, OM is Brahmin (Hindu) and the ON is Egyptian. The ancient capitol city of the Solar - Cult on the Nile was called ON, later renamed by the Greeks to Heliopolis (city of the Sun). Even today we say getting \"on\" with it, mov ing \"on - ward,\" etc. W e turn a light \"on.\" Moreover, the Greek word for Being, is ON (onto). The English call their first number, ONE (again meaning light). W hen one is alone he is \"One,\" (as is the sun alone). In Hindi we have YONI (which relates to the fe male, who is the birthplace). Surely even Masons would never claim the actual existence of Solomon? As Kenealy shows, he is not noticed by Herodotus, not by Plato, not by any writer of standing. It is most extraordinary he says, ―that the Jewish nation, o ver whom but a few years before mighty Solomon had reigned in all his glory, with a magnificence scarcely equaled by the greatest monarchs, spending nearly eight thousand million of gold on a temple, was overlooked by the historian Herodotus, writing almos t necessarily within a few miles of the splendid capital of the national Jerusalem? How can this be accounted for, he asks. Nay, not only are there no proofs of the twelve tribes of Israel having ever existed, but Herodotus, the most accurate of historians , who was in Assyria when Ezra flourished, never mentions the Israelites at all...How is this possible? - Helena Blavatsky "},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"EMMANUEL This is an Anglicized version of the ancient OM ON EL, the names of the Sun, and of Saturn. Also derives from Ammon - El. A mmon was the sun god. Am , was the Semitic and Indo - Germanic sun - god. (See Albert Pike's Book of the Words ) ADON (ADONAI) – Means, “ Possessor,” “Owner,” “Husband,” or “Lord of the Woman,” “Master.” HARMONY Har was the Egyptian for Horus the sun, Mon is the Moon. The coming together of the Luminaries, the opposites creates Harmony !! ISRAEL See Appendix I , for the probable origin of this word. JUDAH - The word can also be rendered Yahud. The root Hud , means “Splendid Ones” “Outshining of God” or “Progeny of God,” etc. The words Yahud, Judite, and Jew , have the same root as the word Judge, i.e., yew tree. The letters, J, I, and Y, were interchangeable an d represented the sacred yew. These three letters turn up as the first letter in the name of god - Iova, Jehovah, or Yahweh, etc. It is, therefore, not merely coincidence that a \"burning bush,\" turns up the very first time that this god is introduced to th e world. It is only when we understand that Judaism and Christianity are branches of ancient Druidism, that the mythographs found in the scriptures stand explained. Then, and then only, do they make sense. (See Irish Origins , Vol. II, for more on the term. ) LUNA This name of the moon, really means Alone. The moon was called the \"Lone One.\" Another common name of the moon was Min (see minute) or Mon (see money). Later when the Solar Cult took over persons of this previous cult became rebuked as \"monsters\" or \"lunatics.\" SOL This term for the sun really means single and alone. There were two suns at one time. From it we get sole, when speaking of being alone, also - soliloquy, solitude, solitaire, solo, solace, etc. CATASTROPHE The word actually means the destruction of a star. Such events were known and considered very ill omens. "},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"DISASTER Also means the destruction of a star. Literally - no star . It can also be translated as \"evil star.\" AUM (OM) This meant sun, or light, or oneness. It may derive fro m Ahom , the first letter of the Egyptian alphabet, which was the same as the Greek Alpha , and Hebrew Aleph . The ideogram for the letter Ahom was a golden eagle. Many symbols of state and business still feature the capital letter \"A\" near to the symbol of t he eagle. In Ireland the sacred alphabet was called Ogham . This word is pronounced Om or Aum . The connections between the world's magical alphabets have been noticed and written upon for centuries. GRAIN The original of this is a word with several meaning s, all related. It means seed, gold, sun and /or woman. The female name Grainne (pronounced granya ) come from it. The word green derives from it and therefore originally refers to the color gold and to the sun. This is the reason why there are place - names all over Celtic countries, such as: Greenhill, Greencastle, Greenwich , etc. They have nothing to do with the color green but everything to do with the color gold and with the sun (see Green Card, Gold Card and Gilders, Sovereigns, Guineas, Crowns). The En glish used numerous such transliterations to disguise meanings and to obliterate the presence of previous civilizations. The site of the time meridian is at Greenwich, England. The word Grain links to sun because the sun was often thought of as a grain or seed. Moreover, the ancients knew that the sun‟s light opened the seeds in the earth. The word meant \"woman,\" because women were considered the literal \"house\" of the male seed. SIDHE Means mound and describes a burial place in the Celtic lands. But the w ord also means \"woman\" and \"breast.\" In Sanskrit it means \"power\" or \"magical force.\" The dead are put into the rise or mound which represents the breasts or the womb. This custom was seen among the Gaels, Egyptians, Teutons, the Gallic peoples and the Sca ndinavians. EGO Gives the modern egg . The ego is the inner sun. The egg when cracked open looks like the sun, with the yellow yolk. GENESIS Really means the Genes of Isis or Generation of Isis. This is because the original story in that so - called first book of the Bible is really an Egyptian Sidereal Tale, taught to initiates in the great Nile temples. Moreover, the"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"syllable Gen means \"woman\" or \"queen.\" In fact this latter word derives from it. \"Queen\" came from qwen or gwen. Gwyn, guen or gwen (which a lso means \"white\"), also gives the Celtic word Guinevere, meaning \" fair woman,\" or \"white queen.\" The original \"W hite Queen,\" was not so much Guinevere, but Isis, Egyptian goddess of the moon, wife of Osiris, the original King Arthur. This fascinating na me also gives Guin - Eve , that is Queen Eve, relating to the primal parent, thus confirming the esoteric status of the Arthurian legends. Gyn meant woman, hence gynecology. W e also get the drink Gin, named so because it was favored by women. The word Genes ( passed down from the mother), Jini, Genealogy and the female name Jean also come from it. \"Genius,\" is called so, because this was someone who was infused with the Muses, the female creative force. A child who was a genius was called so because his \"genes\" were good, meaning that his mother was the cause of the skills. 'Genius' implied that one was favored by the goddess. In India we find the term Guna , meaning inherited traits . W e also get genetics, genealogy, gentle and gentry from it. A \"gentleman\" was o ne that had the feminine sensibilities awakened. One of the figures that stood for the female and still does, is the letter or symbol X (from XI, the Greek, pronounced She ). This is why cars still often bear the phoneme X or XI, etc, to subliminally femini ze them. And this symbol is found on other product logos also. The syllable Gen, also means garden. Genesis can mean, the Garden of Isis, referring to the Earth or even the Universe which we, her children, inhabit. SION As in Mt. Sion or Priory de Sion . This is a common term in Christianity and Judaism, yet few know really to what it refers. It refers to the Royal (Holy) family of Egypt, the four principle gods upon which the Pharaoh founds his dynasty. The gods are Set, Isis, Osiris and Nephthys. The f irst letters of their names make the word S.I.O.N. The numerology of these letters is 1.9.6.5, same as ROSE ( 9.6.1.5 ), which is why the rose is used often on occult circles and used as a symbol of royalty. YULE Comes from the same root as wheel. At Yul e (the W inter Solstice, Christmas) the zodiac has rotated a full turn, like a wheel. The Roman title or name \"Julius\" comes from this. Julius Caesar for instance, was crowned at the winter solstice, under the god Jupiter. Caesar was infatuated with the Ven us/Maia, which he considered his patron goddess. LAZARUS Originally French L‟azuras or L‟asur, means, the Asura. Asur, Asura. Asurya is the sun. The Egyptian name for Osiris is Asur. The raising of Lazarus, is connected to the raising of the dead sun at t he Solstice points, especially winter when Virgo is on the Eastern horizon. Later during the Solar Cult the"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"raising of Lazarus in the home of the Biblical Mary, another virgin, was to do with the opening of the Egyptian New Year, July 25th, then in the sig n of Virgo. Moreover, the word Asur (sun) also gives the prefix for the male gender, Sir or Sire. Even in India it is the same - Sri. These mean the \"noble ones.\" DAVID / DOVE Means Divide and indicates 'Geometry.' The letters of the word seen geometrical ly make the Star of David. The two \"D\"s become a circle, the \"A\" is a triangle, the \"V\" is an downward facing triangle. W e also derive the word Dove from David. This is why there is a dove on the modern credit card and why the Royalty also use the symbol. In Spanish the word for Dove is \"Columba.\" This is where the Knights of Columbus get their name. The District of Columbia, British Columbia, Columbia (SA), Columbia Pictures, Columbia Records, Christopher Columbus and Columbine High School, all derive from the secret meaning of this term and symbol. The name of Columbus , was adopted by Christopher Columbus because he was in the pay of the Knights of Malta, the real founders and owners of America. W e still see the pictures of the ships in which Columbus sail ed. On the sails was the red cross of the Knights of Malta, also known as the Knights of Columbus. Another of their symbols, the dove, is also found on Greenpeace , and in the movie For Your Eyes Only , the criminal group of crack assassins, use the symbol. The Knights of Columbus trace their occult history from the Assassins. CHAOS Consciously associated with confusion and darkness, this Egyptian word meant Light. It was spelt KHUS and meant among many things, angels or beings of light, the pure, exalted s ouls of the dead, stars which set not. TIME From Amit (Sanskrit), which means endless or immeasurable. Also comes from Tammuz, which gives Thomas (see disciples) and Thames, etc. The Thames river in England is also known as the Isis, (the Nile was seen a s a personification of that goddess). The word chimes comes from Time. \"Ch\" often replaced the hard \"T.\" When the great cults decided to join together, the prime symbols and even concepts of each had to be represented in the new gestalt. In subsequent cons ensus, it was decided that the year would represent the Solar Cult's idea of time and periodicity, being calibrated upon the movement of their archetype, the sun. The month would be calibrated along lines that would suit the Lunar Cult, featuring their car dinal numbers, while the week would conform to the paradigms of the Stellar Cult, featuring their sacred number 7. Many other idioms of our age come from this activity, being placations to and commemorations of the power cults of antiquity. The symbols tha t are found on paper money, for instance, reflect just these historical events."},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":" AGE The word Age, comes from the word for goat Aegis, being, therefore, a reference to Saturn (or Kronos), to his sign Capricorn, that has the astrological symbol of a goat. Saturn is the oldest god of time and of cause and effect. CALENDAR From Sanskrit Kala, meaning time. Also from kalatar, signifying a chart for the division of time. TEMPLE From the word tempus , meaning time. The Temple is connected to the zodiac, the ab ode of god. W ords that feature the EL prefix or suffix arise due to the time of the Cult of Saturn or El. W ords like angel, angle, gospel, circle, evangelist, apostle, disciple, Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, elite, elect, elder, elevated, Elohim, Elton, Annab el, elevation , etc, all arise from the time of that Cult. MICHAEL From makal, meaning \"W ord of God.\" SEVEN From the Egyptian Sevekh, a god. Also from Seshet (see Statue of Liberty). Also from Sebek - Ra, the crocodile god ruling over time. SHAMAN Comes f rom semen, referring to the male energy of creation. It may also relate to She - Man (Xi - Man) , since the concept and reality of mystical androgyny was central to the practice of the shaman and esoteric magicians. ABRACADABRA This word is Persian. It is an incantation and really reads, Abr - Acad - Abr. This translates as, god - the one - god . Literally, \"there is but one true God.\" HOOD As in the composite myth of Robin Hood. The word may derive from hod or hog , which in Anglo - Saxon and Scandinavian means Hawk . Robin the Hawk , This fits, as he was identified with Horus and with adroit marksmanship, skill and cunning as well as the fact that he fought the powers of evil. MYSTERY From Egyptian, mest or myst , which meant woman. The serpent was the symbol for myst ery and the Egyptian glyph for woman was also interpretable for serpent. The connection between the Cult of the Priestess and the symbol"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"of the serpent goes back to the pre - deluvian epoch and is an entire study of itself. MASS From the word for W oman and also from mes . This was the annual cake made from the clay gathered from the banks of the Nile and considered extremely sacred. It was ritually baked as small cakes and symbolized the life - giving properties of the female and the Nile which was personified as Isis. BIBLE From the word Buka . This Buka was the reeds which grew on the banks of the Nile. It gave one papyrus. From buka comes Book. Buka was also called Biblos. TESTAMENT From the word Testes , referring to the male generative organs, where the 's eeds of life,' are kept. W ords were often thought of as the seeds of life. Moreover, the word Testes also connotes the light of the sun, without which all writing and reading would be impossible. The reason why one writes from left to right was because thi s is how the sun moved, from east to west across the sky. In other climes this would have been different. (See, \"Moon Letters,\" etc.) GOD This word for Deity, originates from the Anglo - Saxon word Gott , which actually means Goat. This arises because the or iginal tribes and peoples worshipped Deity as a goat, a stag or bull, or any horned animal. Due to the travesty of Christianity the very goat, symbol of God, is now the symbol of Satan the opposer of God. All original gods were shown with horns on their he ads. This is why Michelangelo shows Moses with them, to mark his wisdom and spirituality. This is why monarchs and shamans have them in their head - dresses, i.e., crowns and coronets. Jews wear the Sheepskin. PAN This word referred to the number five - Pen te . The number five had long been associated with god, with prophets, and with the Elders. There are many corporations that employ the phoneme and syllable Pan or Pen , etc. Esoterically, five relates to the Quintessence, to the \"Akash,\" and to the etheric level. The dragon is also a figurative symbol for the number five and its mysteries. The dragon represents the fifth element. A dragon represented the unification of fire (its breath), water (its scaly skin), air (its wings) and earth (its talons). In fabl es and dreams, the dragon is thought to represent transcendence and also initiation into sacred mysteries. Pan represents the same ideas. The god in associated with nature and forests and, therefore, corresponds to the Irish deity Herne (or Cernunnos), to the Hindu Shiva, and"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"possibly to the Egyptian Set, or Seth. The horns of Pan represented the goat or the stag. HERMES The Greek equivalent of Thoth, god of medicine, writing and speech. The Celts had Herne, the god of forests, the animals and wisdom. The word also means Serpent. A \"herme\" is a phallic stone like an obelisk. So Hermes also meant man, probably \"the Serpent Man.\" (See the first card of the Tarot's Major Arcana, The Magician .) The Romans renamed Hermes, as Mercury. From this we get the modern word firm. And interestingly this is the name given to corporate structures and edifices, to imply their masculinity, the fact that they are commercial, and therefore under the auspices of Mercury, the god of commerce. CHEMISTRY and ALCHEMY These come fro m the original name of the land of Egypt, Khem (Khenn). This meant the \"Black Land.\" But Khem was the cradle of the naturopathic arts, of chemistry and herbalism as well as other sciences of the body. This is why the words Chemistry and Alchemy , still bear the root and why the medical profession still uses the Caduceus of Hermes or Thoth, Egyptian gods of healing. EGYPT The word gives us Gypsy. The Gypsies were reputed to have come from there. NUT The name of the great sky goddess and one of the primal pa ntheon, also connected to the Tree of Life motif. Still today we refer to the fruits of certain trees as nuts. ALIVE Comes from the Hebrew Aleph, meaning the breath. Obviously, breath bestows life. Aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It also gives aleve and elf , etc. The corporate logo FILA is it in reverse (thus connoting death). HERO Also comes from the word HERU (Horus). He was the original hero. W hen people celebrate they chant \"Hooray,\" which is also the name of the sun - god, Horus. "},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":"BRITAIN From the goddess Baratana and the name of India, given by the Indo - Europeans, who later came to England. Today the name of India is Bharat. The Indians were known as the Barats or Parats. English are the Brits. INDIA Derives from the ancient word Sindh , which relates to the Cult of the Moon. The Lunar Cult was very strong in Asia, as a look at the various flags and emblems will confirm. The myth of Cinderella , comes from this, the fact that the moon was considered the bride of the sun, that she wed ded when entering into the sign of Leo, the sun's \"palace.\" NOAH The name is of the Bible Patriarch who built the Ark and survived the deluge which destroyed all mankind. In Irish legend the fifth and greatest High King was called Nuada (also spelt Nuah a nd pronounced Nada), came to Ireland after a great deluge which destroyed all mankind. He had come in a \"magical ship\" with a few of his people. The Mayans speak of their deluge survivor Nata, left to re - people the earth. The myth is found all over the wor ld. THE ARK This comes from the Hebrew word for the human breath and also of the spirit, Ruach (Rkh), when an A is placed in front of the rkh, it gives arkh. The real Ark is the Spirit or womb of all life. This is also the reason why we read of the dove b eing sent out from the Ark. The dove is a symbol for the Holy Spirit. Boats and ships have always been used as symbols for the womb, which is why all mariners referred to their ships as \"She,\" and why female heads were mounted onto the prows. The Christeni ng of a newly built ship with champagne or wine, etc, is to simulate the act of insemination. ABRAHAM From the Sanskrit Vedas, Brahma, god of creation. His consort was Saraswati. Curiously, the consort of Abraham, father of the Hebrews, was Sarah. This god gave his name to the Bacchus of the Romans and also to their Brumalia, or winter solstice. This word though Latin actually derives from Brahma, the supreme creator god of the Hindus, god who may be equated in some ways with Saturn or Kronos. The connec tion between the Brahmins and the Romans had been carefully camouflaged. VEDAS The holy books of the Hindus. The word is the same as that of Eddas, the holy legends of the Scandinavian and Anglo - Saxon Skalds. Only thing is these are peoples thousands of m iles away from each other. Both Veda and Edda mean \"Teachings of Knowledge.\" (see AVEDA)"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"ADAM Comes from the Egyptian Atum, the very first Man/God. The numerology of A. T. U. M is 1 . 2 . 3 . 4, the building blocks of the numerical system and also symboliz ing the Cross. (See Myth of Christ). The Semites have Adam, the Hindus the Atma or Atman. Another supposedly Semitic permutation of the word is Adam Kadmon. However, this like the entire \"Hebrew\" alphabet comes originally from Egypt. It is in fact the \"lon g lost\" non - hieroglyphic script. Adam Kadmon (God - Man) comes from Adam - Ka - Amon, meaning the \"Man of the Sun\" or the \"Solar Man.\" THOR Same as the Celtic Athor or Arthur. Both warrior kings and axe wielders, and both held a court made up of heroic figure s. Ireland had Artur. Arthur sat at a Round table, suggesting that he was not a king in the ordinary sense. There is no head at a round table. One title for Thor was \"Don.\" Although this term may just mean \"god,\" we may infer that Thor was the western equi valent of the Phoenician Adonis, that was the basis of the Grecian Dionysus and Roman Bacchus. Interestingly, the Jewish god Jehovah was also referred to as Adonai. Akhenaton's god was Aton, then, was clearly the basis of the Jewish Adonai or Jehovah. And Akhenaton probably heard the term from the Shemsu Hor or their descendants, that is, from men of the west who had brought their gods and traditions to pre - dynastic Egypt. The presence of these westerners, in the land of Egypt, has been well and truly cover ed up by academics and \"historians.\" KING Comes from the root Kin , like kindred. Originally the King was kindred, \"my kin,\" really - \"of my blood.\" The final \"g\" is both phonetic and may also represent the serpent or even the throne of the \"Mother,\" upon which he, the king sits. Throughout the ancient world the king or pharaoh always received the right of rule from the female goddess. He officiated for Her. The symbols for woman and serpent were often interchangeable in ancient cultures. The Egyptian hiero gram for woman was a serpent, for instance. CZAR Comes from the Assyrian, Sar, meaning Sun King. This is probably were we get the name Sarah. DAGDA One of the supreme kings and elders of ancient Ireland. The Phoenicians worshipped him as Dagon, the Fish God. W e may derive the words Dadda or Daddy from it. "},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"CULHULAINN Same as the Mayan Kukulkan or Quetzalcoatl, the \"Feathered Serpent,\" who came from the west. Both had strange births, tremendous strength, long life - spans and magical gifts. ATHENS Consider ed as named after Athena. But originally both names came from Egypt‟s Aten. Aten meant TEN . Aten was a solar god. W ords like attention and attain come from this. (See companies like AETNA, TENA, EATON , etc.) EAMONN Comes from the Egyptian Amon or sun. AU TUMN Comes from the word ATUM, the dying god of Egypt. The sun does wane in the autumn. TATTOO Which means to mark, inscribe or design. The god of writing in Egypt was Tehuti, Thoth, also called Tat, or Teuth. W e derive words like thought, taught, truth a nd Tarot from this name. TA , is used a word used to thank in Britain and it means hidden or sacred in Persian. Thoth was the god of language, measurement and counting, so we have the words today and total and to tot - up . Its all Egyptian ! CHRIST (JESUS) C omes from Egyptian Karast, meaning Anointed. This gives Caress, Cast, Krishna. The Chaldean name of the sun was CHRIS. Karast means to Caress with Oil (hence Crisco oil). Christ was called the \"Anointed One,\" accordingly. The name Krishna also gives rise t o Tristna or Tristan (Arthurian legend). Both had evil uncles, both were physically beautiful, both masters of music (flute and harp) and both played to shepherds, etc, etc. Jesus comes from Jarrus or Jasus who was also called Iesus by the Romans. The Roma ns knew this being as the son of a high priest and dedicated to Neptune. This is of interest since Neptune is the planet ruler of Pisces the sign of the zodiac that is associated, esoterically, with Christianity. This Jasus was known to all Rome, but had n o connection to Israel. Alexander the Great made his acquaintance. Moreover, the Druids had a patron god called Hesus, that had died and who would return as a Messiah. Volumes exist that have detailed the connection of the Christian Messiah with the more a ncient Druidic schools. The Druids also worshipped the \"Bloody Cross,\" long prior to the people of the Middle East or Romans. Mustafa Gadalla has exposed the fact that the entire \"Holy Family\" of the Christians derive from the dramatis personae of the Eigh teenth Dynasty of Egypt. (See his classic Historical Deception )."},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"MARS Comes from the word Mark . The House of Mars is Aries, the symbol is the Ram. RAM is the reverse of MAR. RAMA is another ancient name for God. Mars was symbolized by the human thumb, the palm of the hand and by the capitol letter \"M.\" This is due to the fact that a weapon such as a sword (a seminal Martian symbol) when gripped, sits in the palm, while the enclosing fingers make an M figure over the hilt. Mars was the God of war and aggress ion. In Arthurian legend the enemy of Arthur‟s Court was King Mark . The other adversary of Arthur, Mordred, is Scorpio where the planet Mars was said to rule prior to the re - discovery of Pluto. W e still say that something is \"marred\" if it goes wrong. NUC LEAR An ancient word, spelt Nukt or Nukta, meaning Power. Still we use the slang \"nuke.\" There may be a correlation between the word nuclear , and the name of the Sumerian god - king Enki, who is supposed to have brought mankind the secret of science, particu larly genetics. The vowel - less consonants of this name are, NK. This is also the root of the word ANKH which was the symbol of the gods (really spelling or indicating ANU. N. AKI). The symbol represented their special status and knowledge and the fact that they were, in all likelihood, keepers of the mysteries of the science of life. ATOM From the word Aton , meaning light or sun or force. Atoms have been compared to miniature solar systems. This word also appears to correlate with a god of ancient times, specifically the progenitor god - Atum, who was known and described, suggestively, as the First Cause. RA Meaning Light. This gives us the words Ray and Raj . Many English names end in ray or rey to commemorate the light - (Geoffrey, Deborah, Sandra, etc,) . NUMBER Comes from the Egyptian god KNUMN, who was the Potter - God, who fashions man, instilling in him the frequencies of life. ART From the Egyptian Aart , meaning the Uraeus Serpent, which may have to do with the Kundalini energy without which their co uld be no life - force or creativity. The ways of Art are subtle like the physical movements of a snake. PETER From Petra and back to Ptah, the supreme god of the Memphite Egyptians. Peter was hung on an inverted crucifix, and as such he astrologically stan ds"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"for the W inter Solstice. Ptah was connected with the caves of the underworld where he fashioned the soul. RHINE The word comes from Rune , which meant mystery or holy. ACCURACY Comes from Acura or Mercuria. Mercury was the god of swiftness, agility and accuracy. (See ACURA company.) Dogs were also referred to as curs, because the animal was sacred to Hermes, Mercury and Anubis. The dog is also the companion of the Fool in the Tarot Arcanum. The planet Mercury was known in ancient times and recognized to be the fastest moving of the planets, both on its own axis and in its orbit around the sun. This latter orbit lasts 88 days and this number signifies the planet Mercury and is found in many areas. Several car companies and newspaper, etc, use various Merc urial symbols. MINOTAUR This is a composite word. It refers to the zodiac. The place of initiation was the Labyrinth, leading to the dangers of the underworld. This place was not physical, but in the zodiac. The place between Taurus and Gemini. The end of the word Ge/MINI and the beginning of the word TAUR/us gives MINITAUR or MINOTAUR. The Milky W ay happens to run right between these two signs. The Milky W ay runs across the zodiac from this point until it passes throughout the middle of Scorpio and Sagitt arius, an area of the zodiac of great importance to sidereal astrologers and magicians. It also happens that the Archer of Sagittarius points his arrow (at least did originally) toward the galactic center in the constellation of Sagittarius, specifically S cutus. Many stately houses use effigies of the Archer for this reason and the chief Masonic Hall in W ashington DC is on Shooter's Hill. ATON Is the root of the word Atom and gives us words like Eaton and atonement. It is also an anagram of NATO . In the la ter Hebrew, Aton becomes Adon (Adonai) the name for God. And along with E, the letters A, T, O and N, are the most frequently used of the twenty - six English letters. AMEN Comes at the end of every Christian prayer, yet is the Egyptian word for the sun. S EAT / EAST Come from the Egyptian name for the goddess Aset (Isis). Her headdress was also a seat and she was often referred to as the star in the east. "},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"NASA This is an anagram of the Hindu Sana or Asana, meaning sacred practice and power. Moreover, the w ord Nasa happens to be the initials of the four principle members of the Egyptian Pantheon. The royal gods. Their names in Egyptian are Nephthys, Asar, Set and Aset. (Nephthys, Osiris, Set and Isis). LEAVES The pages of a book are called leaves due to the fact that the ancients, such as the Druids, would write on, mark, or tie leaves of different trees on a cord to represent words. The Egyptians wrote on papyrus which is also a leaf, so to speak. The Irish Druids had 13 trees that they considered sacred. H owever, the reason why these trees where really sacred was that they represented the 13 signs of the known zodiac. The words or intelligence which words communicated was therefore about the stars. PAPER From the Egyptian word Papera (papyrus plant). PYRA MID From PIR - E - MIT, meaning the \"division of Ten,\" (or of number). Ten or Aten was Man, whose body represented wholeness, oneness. This is why Vitruvius, Agrippa, Pacioli, Leonardo Da Vinci, etc, depict Man spread like a Pentacle, divided. Images that repr esent the division or factorization of number will be seen in and around the sculptures and depictions of God and the saints, like Buddha, Christ, Krisha, Brahma, Vishnu, Ishwara, Hermes, etc. APPLE From the word Apollo . Also Avalon meant the Land of the Apples, a veiled reference to the pre - diluvian Garden of Eden and the Egyptian creation myths, which were known throughout the world. Saint Paul in the Bible is an analogue to this ancient mythic character and today we have the names Paul and Paolo , etc. T he name Apollo also refers to the earth‟s axis or Pole. This is because the earth was seen like an apple or 'fruit' in space. There are several companies that make use of the word Polo . Moreover, in ancient times the Siderealists used the symbol of an appl e to represent the female ovum. Females were the goddesses that gave life. Therefore, they were called the Trees of Life. Their produce were the fruits, the apples from the proverbial Tree. (W e still speak of the \"fruit of the loins\"). So apples were ovum that are produced by the female body in order to incubate life. The worm or Serpent that encircles the great Tree and the Apples is the male spermatozoon. Its entering of the individual ovum was always referred to by the ancients as the \"Biting of the Appl e.\" Today we still refer to problem children as “rotten apples.” "},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"MOSES From mosis, meaning the \"royal son.\" Moses was actually Amenhotep IV, or Akhenaton, pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. It also derives from Meshe , meaning \"Anointed One,\" or \" One who Anoints,\" indicating an initiator. This term can be found in names such as Ahmosis and Tuthmosis. VENICE / VIENNA Names follow on from Venus, the goddess of Love and also sexual excess (see Venereal). ARISE Meaning to rise up. It comes from the same root as does Aries. The sun was seen to literally rise - up on the spring equinox, so it became commonplace to say to one another \"rise and shine\" or \"arise good knight\" because the sun's rising was in the House of Aries. In calendar months Aries fall s in April. This word comes from Aperio, meaning to open or I open, because the sun opens the year on the Spring Equinox, in Aries, in April. Many corporate logos and names are based on this word and on Aries imagery. SEARS, SURE, XEROX, SIERRA, REXALL, RE DKEN, LEXUS, DATSUN, NISSAN, ARS, APS , etc. KEEPER As in \"Keeper of the Keys,\" or \"keeper rings.\" Comes from the Egyptian Khepera , which was the title of the Scarabeus Beetle, which represented the sun at the highest point of summer. However, this highest point is in Cancer. Cancer‟s symbol was not the crab, but the Scarab Beetle, Khepera. The stars of Cancer are not visible until December, when the sun is in Capricorn. The ancients saw the stars of Cancer, the Throne of the Sun, in the house of Capricorn. This is, in fact, how Capricorn got its name. Capri is not Goat, but the word Khepera (Khepra - Corn) all really surrounding the imagery of Cancer, the opposite sign. Similarly, the \"Goat - Stars\" were seen in July, so the original symbol of those stars - the Unicorn, became transposed with the house of Cancer. W e see this today not as a horned goat, but as the horned horse or Uni corn ., which is common on all Sidereal heraldry. It is really the symbol for Capri corn as is the Beetle Capri/Khepra for Cancer. Sin ce Khepra corn is the opener of the new year, it was said to hold the keys to the door of the zodiac or calendar. This stellar story is encapsulated in nursery rhymes like Jack and Jill , etc. VATICAN This derives from Vaticinia , or \"Place of Divinations.\" It also has the meaning \"Place of the Sorcerers.\" Underneath St. Peter‟s Square there are miles of mazes and catacombs, reportedly, 25 miles of shelves upon which is kept the secret Vatican Library. (See Irish Origins , Vol. II, for more on this term.) "},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"MON EY Said to come from the Temple of Moneta, in Rome. Many of the terms that are used in banking and finance come from the time of the Roman Empire. CALCULATE Comes from the Greek word Kalkuli , which means pebbles, which were used when learning to enumerate . CREATOR Same a the word creature , from the German Kreator , which meant \"creature.\" Creature signifies Nature, not the anthropomorphic God as creator. This definition also parallels the Gnostic precept that the god of Judeo - Christianity is, in fact, the \"Demiurge\" or fallen archon. PARIS From Perisii, or Parisii, meaning - temple of Isis. There was also a place on the Nile river called Paris. The Seine river is the French Nile. The Cult of the Black Madonna is clearly found behind the building in the Not re Dame cathedral and many of the other structures in Paris and other civic centers are from Egypt, see the obelisks, pyramids, sphinxes, gargoyles, towers, gardens and city layouts, etc. Paris is a strong cultic and occultic center and the sexual libertin ism that it is renowned for is not altogether disconnected from this. Other cities like Venice and Vienna get their names from the same Goddess (Isis and Venus are names and expressions of the same deity). PHARAOH Comes from Pharong, meaning the Liberated One. Also from para or bara , meaning brother. In Hindi the word for brother is pra . It is also connected to the term pharos (fire) meaning light and effulgence. It also derives from the Greek pharos - nous , or lighted mind. Pharoneus or Pharomeus gives Prom etheus, the light - bringer of the later Greeks. The word Farragh, was used in Scotland and Ireland, meaning Chieftain. SACRED This word may come from the same root as Scythian. It may also derive from Sacer, or Zakar , meaning \"phallic.\" SERPENT In Arabic this is Hayyat (Interesting similarity to Hiatt). In Hebrew the word Hawwa, becomes Hevvva, or Eve. The relationship between the serpent or the dragon and the female goes very far back and permeates all mythologies, right up to its most mundane and denigra ted rendition in the Christian epoch. "},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"TECHNOLOGY Primarily, this derives from one of the foremost names of the god of the Egyptian god of knowledge Thoth, also known as Tehuti. Another name for this god is Tech. The term also connoted the serpent. It als o meant to find a way around . (Corporate logos, many of them from the silicon companies, feature subliminal references to the serpent motif, for instance, Apple, Teknekron, Nec, Sun, Nikken , AT&T , Intel, CNN, Isuzu, Chevrolet, etc,). The word may also deri ve from the Egyptian tekh meaning the heart. Technology could paradoxically mean the \"knowledge of the heart.\" This is a somewhat different meaning of technology than is conceived by modern \"scientists,\" those of learned ignorance. GOVERNMENT From the La tin gubernare, and the Greek kubernan, meaning \"to control\" and from Latin mente, meaning mind - that is - \"The Control of the Mind.\""},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":" What does it mean to live in the “Age of Revealing?” It means the light that royals and their secret society masters apparently adore is finally being shore brightly upon their own orders and ideologies.
