The very first thing which we would like to clarify is that both the Tarot and the Zodiac are not external phenomena. They are not \"out there\" and should be considered living essences or archetypes within each individual. You are a living, breathing zodiac. Both Aleister Crowley and William Blake both recognized this fact, and declared in similar ways, that every man and woman is a star . The great German philologist and philosopher Fredrick Nietzsche eloquently and enigmatically penned these words which aptly introduce and encapsulate the theme of the entire Taroscopic Approach : As long as you still experience the stars as something \"above your head\" you lack the eye of knowledge... Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky put it this way: ...when the planets of the Solar http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/introduction.html (1 of 6)16/03/2005 17:26:59"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Taroscopes Tour Introduction System are named or symbolized...it must not be supposed that the planetary bodies themselves are referred to, except as types on a purely physical plane of the septenary nature of the psychic and spiritual worlds. A Taroscopic chart, like any divination chart, is a record of the interaction between the conscious and unconscious dimensions of being and on a gender level between the masculine and feminine polarities. Due to modern society's aversion to right-brain expression, the esoteric disciplines once revered by kings are all but deleted from serious concern, being relegated to the level of novelty and pseudo-science. Though there is a plethora of \"New Age\" books rolling off the assembly lines, few authors or researchers concentrate on the relationship between Tarot and its sister disciplines - Astrology, Numerology and Kabala. The new millennium is here and it is finally time for the re-unification of science and meta- science. The New Millennium signals new paradigms in thinking and experience. It is certainly time for a \"Tarot 2000\" - for an understanding of Tarot, free from clich√©, psycho- babble and dated jargon. It is time for each person to become their own priest or priestess and to dispense with such authorities on the external level.

It is a time when the sacred arts are again presented and taught, as one, for unless the four Hermetic Arts are themselves first considered, learned, taught and practiced as one, consciousness will not know unison. This is the message of the first card of the Tarot, The Magician. His esoteric letter is Beth , which actually means - \"The House of God.\" Though this refers to the Great Pyramid at Giza, it also refers to the human body, one's own temple, one's own veritable house of god. As William Blake reminded us, all the gods reside in the human breast that is - within . The Magician's task is unite the four into one. This is the secret message of the architecture of the Great Pyramid, of the Magician's strange three-legged table and of the grand Hierophants and Druids of Egypt, India, Ireland and the world. Esoterically, the prestige of the cards is supreme. It is immeasurably sacred and contains many magickal secrets, even concerning mathematics and sacred geometry.

In fact, when students of Alchemy are pontificating about the mysterious Emerald Tablets of Hermes they fail to recognize that these are again the actual Tarot. Each person is represented in the Tarot's 78 mysterious and beautiful pages. The Tarot is superior to every other divination method because it primarily employs symbols. There are 240,000 miles of neural threads in the human brain, enough to stretch from earth to the moon. On every micro-meter of these threads there exist 250,000 units of information. This data is, however, recorded only as pictograms, as composite images, not as words. Words are of time, symbols are of eternity.

Christians were told that it was prohibited to make \"graven images\" of their god. This edict came even prior to the prohibition against killing. It was simply more propaganda. We also read that in the beginning was the \"Word.\" But this is itself now proven to be untrue. In the beginning was the symbol of god. This is how it was then and is even now. This is all that god can be to the brain of man. No word can encompass even the smallest part of the Universal Intelligence. Words define the creations and exploits of men, not of god. In order to know the latter, one must develop symbolic literacy . Studying the Tarot is the most apposite manner of developing such capacities. We, therefore, invite you to a \"cleansing of the doors of perception\" regarding one of humanity's greatest empowerment tools - The Tarot.

Look at the complexes and vices which arise from uncertainty and ignorance. We make a wrong move that causes ourselves and others enormous hardship. From these there arises other pernicious quandaries which beset us - guilt, self-recrimination, hostility, frustration and regret, etc,. Or because we think we are right in another area we contravene the space or boundaries of another person, who then becomes an enemy instead of a friend. Is this not the familiar pattern of life? We are prevented from reaching our own goals and excellence when we make these kinds of detours. We constantly make decisions which are so important for our lives and for our responsibilities toward others, making it essential to get proper guidance. Now we already ask each other for a great deal of guidance in day-to-day affairs and we constantly act on the feedback. So what is wrong with going to the Source which always has the right answer? Asking someone who is, like oneself, divorced from their source, for the answers to personal questions is obviously not going to ever foster wisdom. http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/tarotandyou.html (1 of 6)16/03/2005 17:27:19"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Inner Guidance Tarot and You Within each human mind there is the capacity to have inner dialogue. In short, we commune inwardly with ourselves daily in the privacy of the personal consciousness. However, this so-called dialogue is more a chaos of mental chatter. All of us can testify to this. But we are each meant to have a coherent inner dialogue between the conscious and subconscious, the right and left hemispheres of our brains. Today, philosophers and social thinkers, as well as many activists and malcontents, have correctly stated that our technological and intellectual development is far more advanced than our emotional and psychological natures. They lament that there seems little to be done about it. As far as the collective level goes they are perfectly right. As H. M. Jones said: This is the age where we are proud of machines that think, but suspicious of men who try to. Even within the individual there will be no reconciliation of these states until minds become open to what the Divination Arts actuate. They are now, and always have been, the means of inculcating the deeper wisdom so necessary in life. This Source within is the inner guide or \"Oracle\" and we get into contact with it by way of the Tarot. It is known in the Magickal Tradition as \"Communion of the Holy Guardian Angel.\" The Egyptians knew it as the Ka, the Karast (Christ) or simply the \"Double.\" In Alchemy this is known as the Agathodaimon or Aquastor, also as Mercury, Hermes, the Psychopompos. One of the main symbols of this entity is the dog.

In fact it is the real us, the Authentic Being which never loses its rapport with the Universal Order. We, however, lose contact with the Twin very early in life, often immediately after birth. It is the Twin which returns at the point of death. It is this return which causes us enormous regret and pain for it is this Twin that we have neglected for all the attractions of the phenomenal world. The Twin returns in pristine condition whereas we are laden and contaminated with the conditioning of worldly existence. The parting from the Twin is the cause of death's real agony. This is why Christ on the cross cries out to God (Twin-Self) not to \"forsake\" him. This is the cry of the lower self to the higher and not a call to God. The Divination Arts were there long before high- priced psychologists and counselors who are good at the patch-up but are not much involved in the prevention aspects. Healing is one of the most misused words today. It is not a state that one finds after recovery from illness. It is the state in which one never gets ill in the first place. Or have we forgotten this? Human sickness is so severe that few can bare to look at it, but those who do become well - Vernon Howard If it goes on personally it must happen domestically and politically and so on. No human is exempt regardless of their roles. The Creator or Universal Intelligence did not plan for our lives to be that way, full of waste and sorrow.

It is a great thing to be able to close that gap between error and truth even a little. It reduces the chance for karmic rectification, which is responsible for so much suffering throughout the Earth. Karma is primarily ignorance which causes all manner of human tribulation. As Socrates said: The greatest evil is ignorance, the greatest good knowledge. The Tarot aids us in the discovery that we are not merely the roles we assume. Beyond all other information and learning which is commonly sought there is the greater human need to know exactly who and what we are, intimately and authentically. Also, we need certainty in daily life. These are simply not found at the functional or utilitarian level of existence. The work we do for money and security is not the place to look. The physical sciences which explain the material universe are also not involved in answering these macro questions. Lets give up waiting for science and religion to explain the mysteries of being. You are the scientist and your body is the laboratory. The Universe is our great classroom. The planets, stars and luminaries are the teachers. The universe is a super-computer accessed not with binary but with the human intuition. The roles we play may not be the real us! In fact, it is because we have put so much faith in these falsities that multitudes of people are finding themselves in a state of emotional, psychological and spiritual disempowerment.

There are operating manuals, carefully disguised and hidden perhaps but, nevertheless, at our disposal whenever we begin understanding the nature and application of the high arts of Divination. They were created in times past to help us navigate through the tempests of life, that we might arrive safely at our true destinations. Simply, we may think of life as a complex jig- saw. Usage of the Divination Arts, of the Tarot, helps us to see the picture on the lid of box, so to speak. Each of us must do the jig-saw, to that we are committed, but there is a great advantage if you have even a brief glimpse of the cover.

The soul deals with the eternal. Its workings on the deepest level, are beyond the realms of Time, Distance, Space and Speed, which are necessary categories for left-brain cognition only. In fact, as the true Gnostics know, these 4 great interlocking modalities, taught to every school-child, are the very elements created by the Adversarial or \"Luciferian\" Principle (Demiurge) to capture the spirit of man in the realms of illusion. Yet strangely, astrology, which in principle is meant to spiritually and existentially empower mankind, is entirely based on them. How can this have been overlooked? Several astrologers use the words archetypal, spiritual or psychological in their works and then go on to show that they have little idea what these words really relate to.

As Gnostics we recognize three kinds of Time: There is clock-time, measured by the clock or watch. There is seasonal time measured by a calendar. Then there is psychological time and this is measured by the zodiac. The first two are, of course, well known. In fact we are all veritable slaves to them. They're certainly are not doubted. But the lost truth is that these first two originated from the third. This is why they all feature 12 divisions: 12 hours, 12 seasons and 12 signs. To adhere exclusively to the first two and discard the third is sheer insanity and is responsible for the disorder and disempowerment so prevalent in the world today.

Scientists and Behaviorists themselves use many psychological tests, e.g. - TAT (Thematic Apperception Tests) and the Rorschach Ink Blot test, the LAB (language and behavior), the Myers-Briggs, etc,. There are many others accepted by the academic intelligentsia. For instance, for years researchers at Stanford University were trying to determine how many psychological \"Types\" there are. Finally, they came up with 16. Curiously the Character cards in the Tarot, the Courts, which represent the very same Types are 16 in number. They had that centuries ago. Basically, the Tarot works in the same manner as a common thermometer. When you go to the doctor he pulls your records and pops the thermometer in your mouth. You give him the directions as to what the problem is and hopefully the correct diagnosis will be made. It is somewhat the same when one comes for a reading. Your \"record\" is the personal chart and the \"thermometer\" is the Tarot, only it takes the \"temperature\" of the inner psyche, the emotions and the unconscious mind. There is absolutely nothing sinister about it at all unless the practitioner is consciously deviant or malign. The Gnostics were the Earth's first behaviorists or depth-psychologists, so to speak.

The Gnostics, who used the Tarot, knew how to access the \"Living Oracle\" by way of composite images and iconic symbolism. When it comes to the structure and dynamics of the psyche, the Tarot's rich symbolism long predates all of Freud's findings and those of Jung. This is hard to believe for many, because Tarot scholarship has generally failed to illustrate the true meaning of the cards as regards mankind's psychic dynamics. The development of the psyche and all its parts, Id, Ego, Super- Ego, Conscience, the concepts of Regression, Repression, Sublimation, Inflation, etc., are all there. Freud's terminology was all that was really new. But since everyone else who knew these mysteries had been persecuted and annihilated, it took until his times and under the guise of science, for it to resurface and even then it was resisted. It is well known that Jung went on to use Astrology, Mandalas, Alchemy and even a little Tarot research. There is not a single thing in all of Jung which is not in the Tarot. The 4 Types, the concepts of Introvert and Extrovert, the Anima and Animus, the Shadow and Wild Man, etc., are all there. In this age of collective anomie and personal ennui, we would do well to remember that the most pernicious diseases are not, as is commonly thought, of the body, but of the mind, the psyche.

Luckily, we can turn to other disciplines to reconstruct the details that are needed. Through time words change only slightly. Mostly it is the vowels which interchange whereas consonants remain very much the same for longer periods. Ancient written languages like Greek, Egyptian and Hebrew, as well as magical languages, did not commonly use vowels. When History becomes distorted (using synchronic and diachronic manipulation, etc.,) language, words and names often preserve much vital and fascinating information about the world of the past. So it is with the word Tarot . The word Tarot is primordial. During the earliest dynasties of Egypt the supreme mother goddess was known as Tarut (also Ta-urt). As the dynasties and Cults changed she became known as Nuith, Maat, Mah, Maia, Hathor, Isis, Circe and Sophia, etc,. Finally, in our era she became known as Mara, or Mary the Madonna. But the original Madonna was called Tarut.

For instance: Ishtar Tiamat Ashtaroth Astarte Star Tara Thoth Taurus (the Earth sign ruled by Venus) The word Tartan is a derivation as well as the derogatory slang word for women- Tart. This arises because proponents of the Solar-Cult demonized and rebuked all members of previous cults. A worshipper of Tarut becomes ridiculed and scourged as a \"tart\" in the same way as a worshipper of the Lunar Goddess became a \"lunatic,\" \"monster\" or \"sinner.\" (Sin was one of the earliest names of the moon goddess). Another word that was used in the scriptures to defame the priestesses was harlot. This word, however, comes from hierodulai which actually means \"sacred woman\" or even \"beloved one.\" The Bible is full of mistranslations, most of them made purposely to conceal the real meanings. The word Tarut was later pronounced with a soft \"H\" as Taruth, thus giving the familiar word truth . The word tarot and the word truth are, therefore, the same. It follows that if one is seeking Truth to seek out the Tarot. In Arabic, the root - Ta means hidden or secret knowledge. In the Anglo- Saxon eras the strong \"T\" sound was also http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/etymology.html (2 of 5)16/03/2005 17:28:54"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Etymology of Tarot softened to \"CH.\" T-aru-T then becomes CH-aru- CH or Church. A church is obviously a place of worship where the great mysteries of Being can be revealed. But the actual church is, however, not a building but the Tarot. The goddess name Circe (Turk, Kirk) is also a derivation. Her name denoted a circle and that is exactly how the zodiac and the Tarot were always formed and depicted. Circe gives Kirk which means church in Scottish. Even the word thought has its root in Thoth, which has its root in Tarot. The word Thoth means a college. The Tarot is, indeed, just that - a college of the mysteries. The word taught comes from it and so does throat . (The way this word is pronounced in Celtic countries is \"troat\" or \"tarot.\") The word Torah is a direct derivative of Tarot. Torah has come down to mean the Law or the Way, etc,. When we do our theological homework we find that it is an irrefutable fact that the Bible originated from the Torah. However, the secret truth is that the Torah originated from the Tarot, the original Law. This is one of the reasons why in the Major Arcana card number 2 - The High Priestess holds a scroll with the word Torah on it. Those who think that this means the exoteric Torah betray themselves as novices in the metaphysical arts. The figure shown in this card is the very goddess that we have been discussing above and her name is Tarot. She holds the scroll of her name. The scroll is the life that emanates from her womb, the very tapestry of life, multifarious and splendid. The Loom is an archaic motif of the female goddess. One can also correctly see the scroll as the zodiac on which is written the http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/etymology.html (3 of 5)16/03/2005 17:28:54"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Etymology of Tarot destiny, karma and purpose of the Fool - (Archetypal Traveler) who is seen in the previous card and represents the sun on its annual circuit. In Medieval paintings of the Madonna, we will see much use of this unfurled scroll. Moreover, in Hindi the word Toran means gateway. And this is just the image that one sees on the card. Even the numeral for the number 2 (II), has long been associated with a gateway. The High Priestess represents the gateway to the mysteries of the microcosm and the macrocosm which are encapsulated in the cards of the Major Arcana. The word ratio may also derive from Tarot. Ratio means measure, relationship, harmony and order. Moreover, this goddess (Tarot, Tarut, Turat, etc.,) is herself pictured in the deck under cards 2, 3, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 21. It is interesting to note that many of the Renaissance decks mainly feature male characters on the Major Arcana. It is also a fact that the imagery of certain signs of the zodiac like Aquarius and Sagittarius, that were originally feminine, were also masculanized. The name Tarut was known as a goddess epithet far outside Egypt. In Celtic countries like Ireland (to which the Egyptians traveled) we have the word commemorated in Tara, the high capitol and seat of the kings. Moreover, Tara is situated in the fifth province of Ireland called Meath (Mide) again derived from Maat. The Goddess Maat was connected with the concepts of Law and Justice. Interestingly, the province of Meath was the central administrative center where the kings (Chieftains) held counsel. It is http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/etymology.html (4 of 5)16/03/2005 17:28:54"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Etymology of Tarot also suggestive that many famous tombs to the Gaelic queens are there. We still place the image of this goddess with the scales above modern court houses. The Egyptian hierogram for the goddess Maat was also the symbol they used for the fraction 1/2. This implies that Maat represented balance, symmetry, half-way points and equality. Interestingly, the card of Maat in the Major Arcana called Justice is connected to the astrological sign of Libra which lies in exactly in the middle of the zodiac's round of twelve houses or signs. The word-root of Maat also gives us a plenitude of other words, e.g., - mother, matter, matrix, mate, matrimony, marriage, middle, master, math and measure, matriculation , etc,. In Sanskrit, the word Tara means woman and also star (see above). Curiously, the Star card in the Tarot deck depicts a female who is this very goddess Taurt or Tarot.

Our land will stand desolate. Tombs and the dead will be its only witnesses - Aesculapius To this day there are books rolling off the presses composed by would-be Tarot scholars who doubt that the cards originate from Egypt. This denial is totally unbelievable since the very images on the cards clearly depict things which relate to Egypt. Here is a brief example: ONE - For Egypt and the Pyramid The very number on this card is has interesting etymology. ON is the real name of Heliopolis (the City of the Sun) on the Nile. The word On means light. Moreover, the figure seen stands behind a table with a square top and three legs. Upon the top are the symbols of the Tarot Suits which correspond in turn to the Four Elements. They also represent the 4 divisions of http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (1 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins consciousness (the Personality Types) of which the ancients were familiar. The figure is a \"Magi\" (an initiator into the mysteries). He is the \"Psychopompos\" who opens the way and intermediates between the dimensions. Above his head is the symbol of the zodiac while the serpent around his waist indicates that he is a member of the most ancient and august Stellar Cult. The table with its 3 legs and 4-square top is obviously the Pyramid. Indeed the Pyramid with its 3-4 geometry can be seen as a great \"table\" in which the 4 \"elements\" are made 1. The first card affirms, categorically, that the origin of the Tarot is Egyptian. TWO - The Nile and Isis The pillars on either side of the figure represent the banks of the Nile river. These colors, black and white, that we also find in the game of chess, partly represent the harsh barren desert on one side of the Nile and the fertile land on the other. The water flowing as her dress is the Blue Nile which rose in Upper Egypt when the crescent of the moon was in the lower quarter. Behind the figure is the pomegranate tree, a seminal \"underworld\" symbol connoting the telestic mysteries over which the women of old were president. Woman is the literal \"Tree of Life.\" The flowing Nile river is analogous to the female who represents the Universe and the http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (2 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins waters which nurture and cleanse. This is why this cards shows a woman in a flowing blue dress. What else could it be but the river that gave life to all Egypt? THREE - Hathor and the fertile land. This also clearly depicts a personality from Egyptian myth, the goddess Hathor, archetypal mother and consort, symbol of love and marriage. Unlike the previous figure, Hathor is the accessible female. Moreover, once the Nile has inundated the land there came fertility, growth and abundance, as shown in the imagery of the card. FOUR - For Set of the red desert Set was called the Red King. He was ruler of the scorched red desert and god of war. Actually, he was the earliest king of Egypt. Later, during the hegemony of the Solar Cult he was cast as the rival of the sun-god Horus. Set and some other gods are shown kneeling.

FIVE - For Osiris and the Priestarchy Osiris was God of agriculture. The sign of Taurus, which is associated by this card, rules the land and the growing cycles. Egypt was also famous for horticultural marvels and the religious hierarchies which were proliferating in the country. This card clearly relates to the Grand Hierophant, the \"Pope\" of the times, who was originally Atum, then Geb, Ptah and later Osiris. Many of the characteristics of Osiris and his son Horus were attributed to the mythical figure of Christ in the Christian saga. The number 5 therefore appears in relation to Christ quite frequently. SIX - For Horus the Younger Horus was the divine son. He relates to the realm of Tiphareth on the Tree of Life , the 6th http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (4 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins Sephira. Moreover, he was brought up by two mothers. The imagery of Horus was used later for the person of Jesus, who is frequently seen with two mothers or women or sisters. In the old decks ( Marseilles and Oswald Wirth , etc.,) the figure is actually shown like the Pharaoh, with arms crossed, standing at the apex of a triangle symbolizing the Pyramid. The Rider Waite deck preferred to depict Adam and Eve standing in the Garden of Eden. This story related in the Biblical Book of Genesis, was originally codified and taught in the Egyptian Mystery Schools. It dated from the Precessional Age of Gemini (this card relates to the sign of Gemini), and was considerably different in form to the one later used by anthrocentric enclaves to demonize women and introduce the concept of \"Original Sin.\" In the Rider Waite deck we see the male figure looking to the woman, who looks upward to the higher guardian angel. She is the one in direct connection to the Universal Intelligence. This famous image also parallels the supernal triangle on the Kabalistic Tree of Life, with the three figures being analogues of Kether, Chokmah and Binah . (We see the same idea expressed in card XX - Judgment ). SEVEN - For Pharaoh and the 7 Temples of Initiation The most common image of the Pharaoh, the http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (5 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins \"Son\" of the mother Egypt is on his war chariot. Moreover, there were seven great initiation temple sites along the Nile corresponding to the chakras. The number 7 was extremely sacred to the Egyptians since the 7 great stations of the Pole were situated in the Northern sky, in Cancer which is the sign that corresponds to this Arcanum. We get the very word seven from the Egyptian Sebek, Sevekh or Seshet. Seven was the sacred number of the Sidereal or Stellar Cult. Our week was calibrated on the number to commemorate the superordinate status and influence of this Cult of astronomers and magicians. EIGHT - For the Sphinx and the Year Where else could one find an image of a woman and a lion? The Egyptian New Year did not open in January (like the Christian calendar) or in April (like the modern astrological cycle) but in Virgo (which then began around July 24-25 when the river Nile began to flood). Their year's opening occurred when the sun was entering Virgo. Then after the rotation of the year the sun returned full circle and passed through the sign of Leo back to Virgo again. This is why the Sphinx shows the head of a woman (Virgo) and the body of a lion (Leo). The Christians later appropriated this motif and had their Son-God (Sun-God) born of a Virgin. It all goes back to the fact that the http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (6 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins ancient year and zodiac opened when the sun entered the sign or took its \"new birth\" in the sign of Virgo - the Virgin. The Sphinx is a commemoration in stone of this very astronomical scenario. Christ's personal sigil was the fish because the sign opposite Virgo, is Pisces, the sign of the fishes. This fish motif turns up in the feeding of the 5,000, in the earlier story of Jonah and in a plethora of other permutations concerning the Christian ethos. The stories of the Bible concern the movement and relationship of the constellations. (See Astro- Theology pages on this site for more information on this). NINE - For Tem and Atum The waning sun represents the dying god who will enter into the Underworld. This God was Ptah, Tem, Geb or Amun-Ra. Tem is the waning sun. Tem is the root of words like time and temple . The card may also suggest the goddess of the primeval waters and night sky Nun. From this word we derive noon and nine . TEN - For the Aten and Time http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (7 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins The Egyptians Siderealists were the first to accurately measure time and periodicity. The Solar-Cult called the Sun \"Aten\" and pictured him appropriately as a round disk. The god of the Underworld, Anubis, is always seen in this card and clearly Anubis was an Egyptian God. The Sphinx is also featured at the top of the wheel to represent the unification of the four elements. The relationship of man to time was radically different than that which we have today inherited from the nominalist philosophers and apologists for the mechanistic, post-industrial epoch. The Wheel also represents the zodiac itself. ELEVEN - For Maat, Geometry and the Tree of Life The supreme deity of the Egyptians was the goddess Maat (Mayat). She represented the concepts of balance and homeostasis. The Libran Scales signified the precision of mathematics and geometry. (When Libra is placed on the First House of a zodiac there is http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (8 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins perfect balance between all the other elements and archetypes of the other houses). The number 11 is also the secret number of the Kabala which originated in the Magickal temples of the Nile complex. The number 11 figuratively depicts the Magician meeting himself, mirrored, coming full circle, as it were. It is also no coincidence that there are 11 deities in the Egyptian Pantheon (Nun, Atum Ra, Shu, Tefnut, Nut, Geb, Osiris, Isis, Set, Nephthys and Horus). The sign of Libra is the seventh Astrological House and the eleventh Tarot card. The words seven and eleven like the word evening have the term \"even\" in them because they connote a locality of betweeness. The hierogram for the goddess Maat was the same for the mathematical fraction 1/2. TWELVE - For Osiris slain and yoga This relates to the great drama for which Egypt is famous: the death of the King Osiris and his descent into the Underworld. This was the prototype of the Odin and Christ sagas. St. Peter asks to be hung upside down on his cross, Buddha sits in front of the tree, Judas is hung from a tree, the Feathered Serpent of the Mayas has a relation to the tree, etc,. The image also represents the schools and disciplines of yoga which were taught to advanced levels in Egypt. http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (9 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins THIRTEEN - The primal conflict In the war between Horus and Set the victor unites the two lands and wears the double crown. In the Thoth deck the figure on the card is shown wearing this crown. The card often depicts the setting sun and this is due to the season of winter which happens in the sign of Scorpio. The imagery also commemorates the destruction of Tiamat (Lucifer, Phaeton or Marduk, Rahab, etc), the \"second sun\" which exploded and disappeared from sight in the Scorpionic section of the zodiac. This is one of the reasons for the negative traits associated with this card and sign. FOURTEEN - For Tefnut The lioness goddess, wife of Shu (who represented Gemini). Tefnut represented the opposite sign of Sagittarius. This card can also connote Isis who recovers the dismembered parts of the body of Osiris. This card's myriad meanings connect with the kundalini and the http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (10 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins Alchemical Process. The symbolism attached to this card is very esoteric and will be dealt with elsewhere. (See the High Window pages). FIFTEEN - For Apophis. Apophis or Apep or Ammit, the primal serpent and great rival of the gods during their descent into the Underworld of Amenta, the Duat. SIXTEEN - The Earth Polar Axis and human sexuality Central to all the Egyptian myths and their mathematical calibrations was the Pole, the axis of the earth. The pole of the earth was an essential marker in astronomy and the Egyptians knew all about its movement and its stations. They were also aware that the pole had shifted. This event is what the card, on one level, is commemorating. But the picture of the exploding tower is an analogue of the sexual act. It depicts, on one level, the male member in the orgasmic act, but also something much more profound. http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (11 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins The Egyptians also knew the nature of conception, of how the sperm enters the ovum. This is the act that is seen here which is why the background of the card is black as is the interior of the body. The two persons falling out represent the gametes, the male and female, the only genders possible via the act of insemination. At the moment of entrance the sperm literally loses its head which breaks off. This is why we see a tower that is also having its head blasted off. The entire Book of Genesis (Genes of Isis) deals with the mysteries of conception. The primal parents are seen around the \"Tree of Life\" and are forbidden to eat of the \"Apple\" for it will impart a deadly secret. Connected with the Tree and the Apple is the Serpent that \"tempts\" Eve to eat. Beneath all this nonsense we find an important theme. In ancient Semitic times the apple was always a symbol of the female ovum. The Serpent was a symbol of the male spermatozoon which resembles a small wriggling snake. The biting of the apple is a hermeneutic for the sperm/serpent, entering the ovum at the moment of conception. When we hear that the head of the serpent will be bruised we are also hearing about the breaking of the sperm as it enters the ovum. When we hear that there will be \"enmity\" placed between the woman and the man, we must read polarity . The term \"Tree of Life\" was always an epithet for the body of the female who is literally a Tree of Life giving birth to apples, that is, the ovum that incubate life. We still hear children rebuked as \"rotten apples.\" This means that they are rotten ovum or sperms that went wrong. The great worm that tempts Eve is a device for conception. And the story was not only about the sexual http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (12 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins biology we are all versed in. It contained deeper motifs, relating to androgyny and the union of the energies of the Shiva and Shakti, Osiris and Isis, Adam and Eve, etc,. In the myth of Osiris we find him cut into 15 pieces. This is because there are 15 joints to the male body and 14 for the female. 14+15 = 29 = 11 (relating to Justice - the Libran card of the marriage of opposites). In regards the sexual metaphors we may also recall that the card's number is 16 and this is the average age that both sexes have their first amorous encounters. To further analyze the complex symbolism of this card we need to observe that there are 22 flames (yods) or balls shown around the structure of the Tower. These represent the other sperms that cannot enter the circle of the ovum. It is known that only a single sperm can enter the ovum to initiate conception. But there is also tremendous significance to the number 22. There are 10 flames on one side and 12 flames on the other side of the Tower. genetic scientists will recognize that this corresponds exactly to the strands of DNA within the human being, that are also the source of life. There are 3 strands in the coiling braid of human DNA. On one strand there are 10 genes and on the other there are 12 genes and these meet together in a locus point, thus giving 22 genes per strand. DNA and everything regarding it was known to the ancients, though this fact has carefully concealed from the general public. (To even know the shape of the ovum and spermatozoon, let alone the mitochondria, is impossible without advanced instrumentation). The DNA was the Tree of Life. In fact Egypt was known by alien nations as the \"Land of the Tree and the Serpent.\" This relates to mysteries of the body, http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (13 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins the Kabala, to androgyny and the meta-sexual mysteries. It refers to the magical, serpentine staff called the Caduceus of Hermes, borrowed as a symbol by today's medical professions. It is the country were one was sent to learn these and other great mysteries, as Aristotle, Plato, Pythagoras, Solon, Xeres, Ammious Saccas, Hippocrates, Ovid, Apollonius, Iamblichus, Isocrates, Porphyrius, Plutarch, Diodorus, Diogenes, Euxodos, Thales, Plotinus, Porphyry, Herodotus and so many other scholars from throughout the world would readily have verified. So in this one intense card we have the mysteries of conception, of DNA, of sexuality and spiritual androgyny expressed, not forgetting the nature of the earth's polar axis. SEVENTEEN - For Nuith and Taurt The card represents pregnancy. It also has to do with the Great Bear constellation (Ursa Major) which was thoroughly revered by the Egyptian Siderealists. The number seventeen can be expressed as 7 around 1, that is, seven stars around one. The \"Bear\" around the Pole Star. This is why we see the stars in the background of a card called Star . The iconography also concerns Sirius which was seen in the sky during the inundation of the Nile. The \"Lady with the Urns\" was Isis (Tarut), the great and bountiful mother pouring her life-force onto the http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (14 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins parched lands. In exoteric astrology the sign of Aquarius (to which this card corresponds) was masculanized into the man with water-pitcher. When we read about Baptism in the Bible (as in John the Baptist), the esoteric reference is to the signs of Aquarius and Pisces. In the story of Mary Magdalene anointing Christ with spikenard oil we again have the symbolism of the woman with the power of initiation. The figure has one foot on dry land, the other on water. This is to represent the astrological position of Aquarius. Aquarius is after the cardinal earth sign Capricorn, but before the mutable water sign Pisces. EIGHTEEN - For Anubis and Abydos The final stages of the journey of the Underworld. This card is very misunderstood and contains very profound and enigmatic symbolism. Anubis is a form of Hermes or Mercury, the guide into and out of the Underworld. Which is why the two dogs are seen facing one another on either side of a river. Something is coming full circle, coming to an end. The numbers 18 and 9 have long been connected to finishing, as competent numerologists know. NINETEEN - For Amen Ra, Lord of the Sun http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (15 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins Enlightenment, the goal of all Magick. The concept of Androgyny is also presented here. The esoteric letter of this card Resh gives us the English Red . In certain other decks twins are depicted, this being a reference to mystical androgyny. TWENTY - Unification For perfect unison with the Universal Intelligence, as it was in the beginning. Man and woman discover that they have always been in unity with the ALL. The esoteric letter of this card is Shin from which we get our English word shine . The triad imagery of this card subtly refers to the supernal triangle of the Tree of Life. The child in the center is the sephiroth called Tiphareth (the Sun). The parents are Binah and Chokmah (Venus and Mars) and the angelic figure stands for Kether.

Like the two cards previous, this deals with Individuation. Its power lies in showing that the microcosm and macrocosm, the personal and the universal, are only different expressions of the same being. The card deals with coming full circle. The ancient Gnostics asked the question as to whether all movement and progress is an illusion. On a circle every point is equidistant from every other point. As we travel on a circle we are always as far away or as close as we were from our supposed goal or ambition. What does all this tell us about the universe, time and the great journey of life? Is it the movement or the moment that is important? The Pythagorean Magi had a maxim stating that the circle gives birth to the line, but the line does not give birth to a circle. TWENTY-TWO (Zero) - for the god Shu. Shu represented not only the new-born sun but also the air which surrounds us and carries the http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/egyptianorigin.html (17 of 21)16/03/2005 17:31:23"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Tarot's Major Arcana Egyptian Origins light of the sun to all parts of the Earth.

This question has not been dealt with appropriately by most writers. The answer should be known to those within cognitive sciences, the behaviorists and psychologists, etc,. Unfortunately, most of those who have expertise in these fields are not interested in occultism or Divination. So a simple discovery becomes again a mystery due to the divisional and exclusionary nature of human studies. Psychology text books of future generations will look back on the modern psychologists working without the aid of astrology as being like the medieval astronomers working without the aid of the telescope - Richard Tarnas Ph.D For the Tarot and Astrology to work they must have an intimate connection to consciousness.

Regardless of the epithets and terminology, however, if this force does indeed exist, then we need to find out: How it came into existence? How it operates? How we get into direct communication with it? The entire Taroscopic Approach rests on these three questions or themes which go directly to the heart of the connection of the Divination Arts to human consciousness. By Way of Analogy When the Two and Two equal One, then there shall be born the Christ within - Gnostic Adage Lo, what you think is Four, is Ten and as a perfect triangle - Pythagorean Adage The proof concerning the connection between Tarot, the zodiac and the human consciousness is best explained through the means of numerical analogy.

This is why certain numbers were associated with so-called \"angels\" or \"devils.\" Originally, consciousness was merely primitive sensory response. The neo-cortex did not exist, the mammalian brain did not exist and thought as we know it was non-existent. Consciousness, for want of a word, was at the rudimentary or primal stage. The cerebral spinal system was then a single ganglion and from this we have the understanding of ONENESS. This state grew out of and recognized the ZERO, that is the protean, omnipresent, uroboric, pleromatic state from which all originally arose. Strangely, no one can conceive or point to something that is actually \"nothing\" and yet we do have the concept. We do so because of the fact that consciousness arose from a state that it now, due to its own dialectical proclivities, can only conceive as \"nothing.\" This \"nothing\" was often symbolized in ancient times by the waters of the primordial abyss and even by creatures such as the snake, the crocodile, the reptile or some demonic entity. We still use the term \"reptilian\" or \"mammalian\" to connote this primal cognitive stage of the brain. This single ganglion, the rudimentary ego, was oriented toward the inner world of the Id, the Unconscious. One can imagine it, as the Egyptians did, as a single infinitely delicate petal upon a single lotus or papyrus stem rising out from the waters of oblivion. From this stage of singularity there arose a secondary apparatus. This was to furnish a center which could respond to the \"external\" world and reality.

It is the act of primal scission that the Book of Genesis depicts, as well as any other myth that speaks of dividing waters or dividing luminaries. We read that the light separates from the dark, that the heavens separate from the earth, that the sun divides from the moon, etc,. And we have the motif all through mythology of the twins. We read of the evil Set and his good twin Osiris or Horus. We read of Cain and Abel, Christ and Satan, Adam and Eve, Enlil and Enki, Jacob and Esau, Arthur and Mordred, Sir Balin and Sir Balan, Tristram and Mark, Odin and Loki. We read in Celtic faerie legends of the light and dark sisters, etc,. It is theme of art, both high and not so high. From this actual scission arose the implicit a priori category of TWONESS. The entelechy continued through the centuries and from the Two, like a fleur du li, there arose a third apparatus which had the job of administration, of processing and synthesizing the experiences and intelligences of the antecedent ganglion. Thus arose the important concept of THREENESS where consciousness rested for a time. It was relatively harmonious and stable. The titanic and threatening forces from within and without which assaulted the vulnerable ego were now kept somewhat at bay. This is why, even today, Threeness is considered an archetype of harmony and beauty. From members of the Christian religion we hear of the \"Trinity\" which is, despite the dressing, a commemoration of this stage of consciousness. From the Three there came forth the Four.

The Four Types All psychologists know of the 4 great hemispheres or modalities of modern consciousness. Carl Jung named them the: The Intuitional Self The Rational Self The Emotional Self The Sensational Self. So when we see the Magician card in the Tarot with the symbols of the 4 Suits on his table, we are looking at a disguised image of the union of consciousness, an act always associated with Magick and the province of the master Magi. The Christ on the Cross or with his four Evangelists, the Pharaoh on the Cube, Osiris with his four sons, the Joker in the common deck dressed in his four colors, the Indians with their four directions, the dancing Divas of India with their four arms, the dance of Siva with his square- crossed legs, and the plethora of other quartering motifs we understand that what is being expressed is the Magnum Opus - the uniting of the four hemispheres of consciousness.

We see the magician standing within a pentacle, or wearing it about his neck. Students of art may be familiar with the drawings coming out of the Medieval and Renaissance period, especially those of Vitruvius, Agrippa and Leonardo Da Vinci, which depict \"Adam Ka Admon,\" the Anthropos, standing in the shape of a 5-pointed star. These depictions hearken to the future state of consciousness - the Quintessence.

If you look again at the famous Papyrus of Ani (also known as the Hall of Judgment scene) in the Egyptian Book of The Dead you will see a depiction of this phylogenetic evolution from the first part to the fifth. This is a very sacred and enigmatic piece of artwork. Its original name was not the Book of the Dead but the Book of the Coming Forth By Day . This title connotes the rise from uroboric unconscious existence into the light of consciousness. In front of the Pharaoh, rising out of the waters on which his cubic throne rests, one sees a lotus or papyrus shoot. The shoot rises as ONE, then clearly bifurcates into TWO, which then divide into THREE, and upon these one sees the FOUR. Then, to emphasize the connection to consciousness, the four sons of Horus (or Osiris) are shown standing upon the lotus. They are the final outgrowth of the plant. These four \"sons\" are called the guardians of the directions, the cardinal points. They represent the four psychic divisions within the being of every man and woman. So, in fact, this famous papyrus shows, among other things, the very origin and nature of the psyche that Carl Jung and others re discovered in more modern times. The Pharaoh is the fifth element.

Death to the four and resurrection was known and revered long before the advent of Christianity. The Pharaoh is also the child, or son, of Egypt. He is the agent of goddess Mayat, who is seen often behind the throne. His throne is a cube because one of the meanings that the Egyptians wanted to attribute to it was that of the primordial mother. Salt crystals, which are cuboid, represented the Earth Mother. Moreover, the sum of the angles of a cube is 270, the exact number of days in pregnancy (9 months). So the Pharaoh represents the child Horus rising out of and administrating for the goddess, that is for Nature (Neter). He reaches the fifth element because he and the Universe are in perfect harmony. (Stay tuned to this site, for a further detailed dissertation on the real meaning of the enigmatic Book of the Dead .) Interestingly, a cube when opened up into its planes, makes a perfect Latin Cross.

The founders of the later hegemonic religions simply plagiarized the themes of previous \"pagan\" cults, after which they persecuted their rivals and had them massacred in great numbers. We should now understand that consciousness has risen through 4 great stages. It did this sequentially but the antecedent levels are not forgotten. They remain intact today.

The stage of Four and the one previous, the Three, are of great importance in the understanding of Tarot, Astrology and all other Divination and Magick. The architects of the great Pyramid at Giza did not employ the triangle and square without very good reason. Their choice has never sufficiently been dealt with by modern scholars. We are told that it is another of the \"unsolvable mysteries\" of Egypt. Their temple's design was based on the origin and evolution of the human consciousness, so that when one is within the pyramid they are actually standing within a stone simulacra of their own mind.

The relationship of all these 4 ascending stages, gives rise to other number harmonics, all of which aided the mind, the ego of man, to orientate itself in the creation. It is its ability to do this that is commemorated in the mythologies of the various peoples, in their myths and religions, rituals and customs. The ego immortalizes its own genesis and journey in this manner and generations preserve it forgetting what the myths and stories really depict and allude to. Often those we call \"great\" in music, art or architecture, etc., have their greatness coming from the fact that they are proficient in giving form and expression, consciously or unconsciously, to the movement through time of the ego. The ego is the Hero, the champion of mythology, who slays the monsters of the deep and rises to greater heights. As we will later see the greatest \"art\" book in the world, the Tarot, also depicts this great Becoming. The Ego has not moved beyond the stable Four as yet because it has cognition of all the other quantities and numbers from 4 and the relation of 4 with the 3, 2, 1 and 0. and from that relation developed the power of addition and multiplication. This is why the symbols for these capacities are + and X (the cross of consciousness).

Its symbols are X and + (the cross). This links with Egyptian mythology and the Christian ethos as both the Pharaoh and the Christ are seen as \"Quartered.\" This means that the postures that they are seen in and the mythologies surrounding them are precisely designed leitmotifs and fictions which elaborate a great theme that cannot be fully explicated in a linear manner. Originally the purpose of speaking obliquely was not to conceal, but to reveal - Brinsley le Pour Trench The name of the first god of the first dynasty of Egypt is ATUM and is where we get the word ADAM. They are both progenitors and the latter certainly originates from the former. The Hindus also had this embodied in their ATMA or ATMAN. The Greeks, like Zosimus of Panopolis, identified the letters of ADAM with the four elements. We also get the word Atom from this and the Semites have their Adon (Adonai). http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/divisionoften.html (1 of 8)16/03/2005 17:35:28"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Division of Ten These terms all refer to the \"First Cause.\" Numerologically, the word ATUM is extremely interesting. Its letters, amazingly, are 1, 2, 3, 4, which equal 10. Now ADAM gives 1, 4, 1, 4, in western Numerology - also equaling 10. (The reason why Adam is 1414, is partly because of the human hands. Raised in front of one they figure as 1414. One thumb, four fingers. This is just the way the ancients did things, which seems strange to us. Adam was the hands of God, the builder, the namer of the animals, etc,). This accounts for why the Egyptian Pyramids were always of 4 sides. They were living monuments to the genesis and ascent of consciousness. The most interesting fact is, though, that both of these \"gods\" represent the fourth level of human consciousness, which is sentient and objective and endowed with reason and imagination. The numerology of the names is a confirmation of the connection with consciousness. Many other gods and heroes have the imagery of Fourness. Many names of god are four letters, no less than the most important name of all, the so-called Tetragrammaton Yod, He, Vau, He (I.H.V.H). There is another interesting Egyptian connection. The word pyramid really derives from the Egyptian pir-e-mit which means \"Division of Ten\" (or division of number, or division of perfection). This is why it looks as if it is just that: A base of 4 and sides of 3. The Pharaoh's crossed arms are also a ideogram for \"Division of Ten.\" This is because TEN or ATEN is Man. He has, literally, arisen due to entelechy, a division from pleromic unity, as we have briefly http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/divisionoften.html (2 of 8)16/03/2005 17:35:28"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Division of Ten explained. These early god images and the architecture of the ancient monuments are encapsulations of the origin and evolution of consciousness. There are several other examples of this mathematical and geometrical premise, the \"Division of Ten.\" One is Moses coming out of the \"holy mountain\" in Egypt with the Ten Commandments. But they are on two tablets, five commandments on each. Hence \"Division of Ten.\" The sacred mountain is not however, Sinai, but the Pyramid, the real holy \"mountain\" in Egypt. The word Moses did not mean \"from the waters\" but one who has baptized with water. Moses, or at least his prototype, was an initiator into the hermetic mysteries. There are several stele and cylinder seals from Babylon and Abyssinia, etc., that show the King, like the Pharaoh, in an enclosed precinct, sitting on a cube throne holding the \"Ring and the Rod,\" that is, a circle and the staff, these being the symbols of the union of masculine and feminine polarities and modalities of gender and expression. They are also a sigil of the division of consciousness. But the ring and the rod or the circle and the staff are the sigils that we still use for the number 10. The Goddess Lilith, in an early carving, is also seen with her arms symmetrically divided while each hand grasps the ring and rod symbols. In the Celtic or Gaelic periods we see the horned, forest god, Herne (sic, Hermes), also called Cernunnos , sitting in a yogic asana, holding a long coiling serpent in the left hand and a circlet http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/divisionoften.html (3 of 8)16/03/2005 17:35:28"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Division of Ten in the right hand.

It reduces to timeless archetypes. Modern computer \"intelligence\" must be based on the human intelligence, which evolved in a certain definable manner. Myth and Occult doctrines have been recording and commenting on this evolution for millennia. We need to see that Intelligence of every form has the same premise and the same archetypal basis. Man was shown in the famous drawings of Da Vinci, etc., as a \"Division of Ten.\" And before him the same Adam was depicted in his square or pentacle by the designer Vitruvius. The number 10 relates to androgyny. The cross was the sigil of the number ten. So when one sees Pharaoh, with his masculine right hand crossing over the left side and the feminine left hand crossing his right side, we realize that the implication deals with this concept and state of Androgyny. Sexual imagery in sacred art was merely an exoteric device to relate much deeper, abstract concepts.

From addition and multiplication of 3 and 4 (the latest stages of consciousness) we get 7 and 12. It cannot be denied by anyone in religion, mythology or psychology, the role played by these two numbers. In the occult tradition they are supremely important, though it will be shown later that it is really the ratio of 3 and 4 that makes them so. Consciousness had then within it the categories that enabled it to orientate itself in the outer world. Its ability to enumerate was essential and can even be considered indistinguishable from consciousness. The realms of the unconscious and the shifting, protean external, could now be navigated. Psychic and physical energy can now interrelate. Through the faculties of inflation and projection, so lucidly explained by Jung, the mind foisted its innate categories onto the external world. In the same manner as a projector throws light beams onto a screen, casting images that are taken for reality, so the mind \"threw\" out its \"light\" - its consciousness. The net result was that man attained his \"Being-in-the-World.\" He cemented himself in his environment and saw that it was good.

We have seen a brief interpretation of how the mind ascends through its 4 main divisions, which provided the basis for a symbiotic relationship with reality. We have an idea that this ascent is commemorated in all the great complex myths of every culture and epoch. However, the fact is that human consciousness found that Fourness and all the prior stages were too limiting to completely account for and embrace the diversity of physical phenomena and, without wishing to dispose of the 4th principle, it discovered the principles we now know as \"addition\" and \"multiplication.\" Through this means it expanded its working template and had at its disposal the 7 and 12. In those days when man first centered himself as an authority in the Universe, he looked to the night sky and found it the analogue of his inner Unconscious. Of both he was frightened, for they seemed spasmodic, chaotic, full of random http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/originofzodiac.html (1 of 3)16/03/2005 17:36:40"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Origin of the External Zodiac happenings, which threatened the autonomy of the ego. It was onto the night sky that the mind first projected its template, of the 3, the 4, the 7 and the 12. Blake calls this the \"Great Chain.\" This is the way that the zodiac was born with its 12 signs, 7 planets, 4 elements and 3 modalities. Man patterns the external on the internal. We have turned our minds \"inside-out\" so to speak, in order to feel acclimatized and secure in the Universe. The process continued until everything was circumscribed by the psychic projections. Every infant partakes of this psychic activity. Because it is all happening subconsciously, the conscious mind ends up thinking that the Universe is inherently encoded with the categories the mind has actually projected there. This is the reason why we today think of the zodiac and the planets as innately effective on consciousness and personality. They are to the mind that sees things in reverse. To us it is a greater mystery, a more intriguing tale, when we know the original means. Anything that contains the 3-4 proportion or geometry will resonate with consciousness. Summary Divination, and prediction, etc., is legitimate and possible because both zodiac and Tarot are founded upon the 3-4 (7 and 12) proportion and ratio. (See more on this ahead).

Conclusion As shown above the Tarot and Astrology (and other Divination Arts), are founded on the 3-4 template. This is because they are intimately connected with the nature of consciousness. The latter can therefore easily be analyzed by way of Divination as has been done for thousands of years. All the rankling and skepticism is completely without validity and is the product of little education. As if the mind of man could distract itself for aeons in wasteful pursuits. It is the towering vanity of most modern intellectuals, with their comfortably biased but desolate theories, that have fostered the pernicious condescension toward these ancient arts. As we move into a New Millennium the human race is found remedial in its understanding of itself, of its own mental, emotional and psychological workings. In 2000 years there is little trace of psychological improvement on the collective scale. Some have said that we have been, culturally and spiritually, in retrograde. The average individual remains as greedy, artificial, violent and immoral as ever. Infatuated with the material and intoxicated with the fallacies of technology and science or clinging to the hollow, exploitatory orthodox religions to alleviate the inner void, the non- individual will undoubtedly remain a victim of his conditioning. The time has come for a return to the great mantic arts that our forefathers created for us. The Divination Arts are mirrors to our real selves. It is time to dust them off and look deeply into what they reveal. We each desire to be \"original.\" This very word, however, implies origins. It implies seeking out the roots and foundations. In this New Millennium we again have the opportunity to re-visit the roots of Gnosis and reconnect ourselves to the Universal Intelligence, to be free once and for all from what Alex de Tocqueville referred to as \"the tyranny of the masses.\" We shall not cease from exploration, And the end of all our exploring, Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/three-fourproportion.html (5 of 6)16/03/2005 17:37:01"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The \"Three - Four\" Proportion T.

The reason for this number is manifold, though we need look no further than the cards themselves for one elucidation. The numbers 7 and 8 relate to the seventh and eighth cards, named Chariot and Strength. These cards are the Tarot equivalent of the 4th and 5th astrological houses and represent the houses of the Moon and the Sun. When the Luminaries are brought together there is harmony. They represent the union of the genders and all other polarities. Thus the number 78 relates to the coming together of the Sun and Moon, the masculine and female, the nagual and the tonal, etc,. It may be realized from this that the number of Atus (cards) was certainly not arbitrary and cannot be legitimately changed. (This is only one reason why the cards are 78). The houses of the sun (Leo) and moon (Cancer) are also the reason why in throne rooms we see the king and queen sitting side by side. In heraldry (which has close connections with astrology) we see the Lion and the Unicorn motif used frequently. The ancient symbol of Cancer (sign of the pale moon) was the unicorn not a crab. The pale, white Unicorn faces the red Lion because they symbolize the coming together of the Luminaries (the real King and Queen) whose thrones are the royal houses or signs in the http://www.taroscopes.com/taroscopestour/outlineoftarotarcana.html (1 of 4)16/03/2005 17:37:20"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Outline of the Tarot Arcana northern sky. The sun rises highest in the sign of Cancer and burns hottest in Leo. This made the Egyptians revere the sign of Cancer more and considered it, the royal sign. Their symbol for Cancer was the scarab beetle, called Kheper or Khepra (later degraded to a crab) who pushes the struggling sun up to its exalted throne in its own house of Leo. How many times have we seen the beautiful Medieval tapestries depicting the Maiden/Virgin and her docile Unicorn. They are always surrounded by a circular fence which, suggestively, has 12 posts.
