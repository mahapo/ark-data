[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" The Occult History of Ireland (A Brief Introduction) (From an interview with Michael Tsarion, recorded on the Resonance Radio Show, 2006) ◊ ◊ ◊ Almost every time acts of terrorist violence have occurred in Northern Ireland (and it does not matter whether it was the IRA or the Protestant paramilitaries who were responsible), the victims have habitually accepted the official reports of what happened. In the case of the Omagh bombing on August 15, 1998, when families did not blithely or blindly accept the \"made-for-tv\" spin, and did conduct a personal investigation into the reasons for the atrocity, we find the whole propaganda machinery being tossed out the window in no time at all. I recommend the movie Omagh to those readers who are unaware of the occult history of Ireland. It will serve as a good primer on the subject. While watching the movie, remember that these were Protestant men and women who believed that their elected government officials would never lie to them and that the police were their best friends. By the end of their traumatic investigations, however, the group in question was able to discern their real enemy. Shockingly, it was not, as everyone thought, the IRA. A must see movie that exposes the British complicity in IRA terrorist attacks Indeed, studying the history of the IRA (the Irish Republican Army) proves most interesting. But it is a study that has, in the end, less to do with politics and more to do with secret orders and hidden agendas. As my good colleague Jim Cairns explains: At the start of the Irish \"troubles\" in 1968/9, there was only one group called the IRA in Ireland, however, a split developed and a separate group of IRA activists was formed, calling itself the Provisional IRA. There is a cloud of uncertainty surrounding the formation of the Provisional IRA in 1969, and there seems to be a deliberate attempt to conceal certain facts. Pro-IRA writers give scanty explanations for the foundation of the Provos, but if one looks hard enough, one discovers some interesting truths. In 1968/9 the IRA, as it was called then, had a very socialist outlook. Its left-wing members saw the protestant Unionists in Northern Ireland as the enemy but they were also very resentful towards the large estate owners in the Irish Republic. In 1969, the IRA in the Republic of Ireland (the 26 Southern Counties) made a number of attacks on the properties of large estates in the west coast of Ireland. These attacks, on private property in Eire, were greatly resented and were seen as a direct threat to the status quo. A group of wealthy and powerful businessmen and property owners saw the need to control and oppose the activities of this left- wing faction within the IRA and they concluded that the best way to do this was to promote and support a new IRA faction, which would be effectively under their wing. Thus, the Provisional IRA was formed in 1969 under the leadership of David O'Connell and an Englishman called John Stephenson, alias Sean McStiophan. With the backing support from these \"hidden\" establishment figures, the Provisional IRA would soon become the dominant IRA grouping, and the Official IRA (the original IRA with left-wing supporters) soon became eclipsed and declared a ceasefire in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"1972 - ( Disappeared Off the Face of the Earth ) From the researches of men such as Baron Avro Manhattan, we know about the extensive power of the Jesuit Order and Opus Dei. We know these cabals serve the interests of the Atonist elites ensconced in London and Vatican City. We know from the findings of experts and whistleblowers how much control the Jesuits, Teutonic Knights, and Knights of Columbus, etc, have over certain Catholic terrorist groups, including the IRA. Not only have Catholic priests regularly absolved IRA murderers of their heinous crimes, but many priests have served as commanders of IRA divisions. Most, if not all, of the convicted IRA inmates received regular visits from senior Catholic priests, including bishops, who have taken their causes and even bestowed blessings upon their heads. The young patriotic men who felt compelled to join the IRA know little about their true enemy or that their society is connected to many international criminal syndicates, some of them quite ancient. No, the average IRA member had his attention and ardor artfully channeled elsewhere. So it was through the generations, and so it remains today: The insignia of the Jesuit Order, emphasizes their connection to ancient Luciferian Solar Cults. The letters IHS represent the ancient Irish god Iesa, the basis for Jesus. This Irish Catholic organization (The Defenders), similar to that of the Spanish Guarduña, was founded in 1562 by Roger Moore behind whom were French and Spanish Jesuits. According to Captain Pollard, author of \"The Secret Societies of Ireland,\" \"The nominal function of the Defenders was the protection of the fugitive priests during the period of proscription...the Defenders soon became a criminal association of law-breakers and banditti\" – Lady Queensborough ( Occult Theocracy ) In regards the so-called \"opposition\" - the Protestant societies - one of the most important for readers to be aware of is the elusive quorum known as the \"Black Preceptory\" that hides itself behind the infamous Masonic \"Orange Order,\" which is a tentacle of even more elusive British and European orders such as the Illuminati. The Black Preceptory is also known as the \"Royal Black Institution,\" a name that sounds worrisome enough. This quorum includes judges, police executives, clergymen, senior intellectuals and academics, and men who run major corporations in Ireland and elsewhere. The Preceptory's senior members have the power to change government policy on a local and even national level. They can reward their selected lieutenants in the public limelight for furthering their agendas, and can see to it that other men who do not fall into lockstep are removed from professional positions. The Order can certainly control the local media's coverage of events in Ireland and can, when it suits them, force complicit editors to bias reportage in any manner desired. The emblem of the Black Preceptory, or Royal Black Institution. Their festival day falls on July 13th. (Click pic for more info.) Alarmingly , they have enough power to command assassinations and acts of terrorism. They further their own agendas by fomenting conflict and expertly pitting one ruthless sectarian faction against another. This is an old story when it comes to the provinces of Northern Ireland. We are all privy to the effects of sectarian hatred and bloody violence. But are we privy to the causes ? That is the question. In the Republic of Ireland, the wealthy and powerful Masonic elites concealed themselves behind societies known to Irish historians as the \"Clan na Gael\" and the \"Ancient Order of Hibernians.\" Another name for the latter group was the \"Green Ribbon Order.\" Bearing this in mind, when we see Gerry Adams (or other Sinn Fein leaders) wearing the little green ribbon that looks like the AIDS ribbon, we'll remember what is being told to us on a subtextual level. Do your homework and you'll find out that this green ribbon stands for the Green Ribbon Society, a division of the Ancient Order of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Molly Maguires - another must see film, with Sean Connery and Richard Harris.

It was succeeded in the 1840’s by Young Ireland, which...was directly linked with Mazzini and that other revolutionary tradition, romantic nationalism; and then, in the 1850’s, by the Irish Republican Brotherhood (called Fenians after the pre-Christian warriors), was largely modeled on the rival Carbonari model of republican conspiracy - ibid The investigations of R. C. Clifford detailed in his book \"The Application of Jacobinism to the Secret Societies of Ireland and Great Britain\" led this author to the conclusion that The United Irishmen and The Illuminati bore one another a close resemblance – Lady Queensborough ( Occult Theocracy ) The very flag of the Irish Republic reveals these secret associations. It tells us the story symbolically. The green on one side, the orange on the other and, in the middle, we see the white band. Do we ever bother to question who or what this white band represents? Who are the illuminated \"White Brotherhood\" positioned between the orange and green wings? Could they be the Knights Templar whose history goes back to the Culdeans, Cistercians, Fenians, and Milesians (Atonists) of ancient Ireland? Could they be the Order of the Illuminati that is not supposed to exist? In \"The Secret Societies of Ireland\" Captain Pollard writes that, founded in 1641, \"The notorious modern society known as The Ancient Order of Hibernians is the direct successor of the original society of Defenders; in common with its ancestor it attempts to enable the clerics to exercise control in politics.1 It claims in its own official history, published in 1910, to be the oldest secret society in Ireland. Independent researches show that the claim is sound and that the present A. 0. H. is the descendant of certain criminal organizations of the past. The open admission of this chain of descent by its own historian is important. American sources trace the A. 0. H. to 1565 but the date 1641 is that more commonly accepted\" – Lady Queensborough ( Occult Theocracy ) In 1869 a new secret Irish-American organization was formed, known as the Clan-na-Gael. It traces its origin back through a permanent secret society known as the Knights of the Inner Circle, which, in turn, descended from the Knights of St. Patrick, known as the Ancient Order of Hibernians today – Captain H. B. C. Pollard ( The Secret Societies of Ireland ) ...the A. O. H. in America has for many years been under the direct control of the Clan-na-Gael which also influences through the A. 0.

If you ask people to identify the paramilitary organization that has committed innumerable atrocities in Ireland for the past 60 years or so, they will be bound to mention the Provisional IRA. But ask people to identify the secret societies from which the IRA arose and you'll be greeted with silence, head-scratching, and puzzled brows. Hidden Agenda - one of the most important movies portraying the shadowy and sinister powers operating behind the terrorists of Ireland. Go to an encyclopedia and find the entries for both the Official and the Provisional IRA. Most likely an entry will confirm that the IRA originated from the so-called \"Irish Republican Brotherhood.\" Brotherhood!? Yes, that's right. That is the name by which the infamous Provisional IRA were known before they began calling themselves an \"army.\" The latter term implies a political body. The former term implies something quite different. It implies a secret fraternity . And that is exactly the point that needs to get across to those men and women who have been victimized by this terrorist organization. The Sinn Fein emblem is the white dove. The dove symbolizes the Atonists, also known as the \"Davids.\" The Atonists have been in control of Ireland and England since approximately 500 BC. Their symbol of the dove can be seen on the maces and scepters of the British royals. It is a symbol that can be found on credit cards and the logos of corporations and charities such as Greenpeace. It does not , however, represent the Holy Spirit. After all, what would Sinn Fein be doing using a symbol that represented the Christian Holy Spirit? There is nothing holy about Sinn Fein, regardless of what their Jesuit controllers imagine. Sinn Fein, an Irish patriotic organization advocating boycott and passive resistance against England was founded by Arthur Griffiths in 1905. He was succeeded as president in 1917 by Eamon de Valera. By that time the Society was controlled and subsidized by the Clan-na-Gael and Germany – Lady Queensborough ( Occult Theocracy )"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"My brother and I at a Communist Party festival in Bodenstown, on the West Coast of Ireland. Exposure to all \"colors\" of the political spectrum proved invaluable when it came to my researches into secret society activities. As we are saying, Sinn Fein is a tentacle of fraternal societies funded and operated by the very royals that the members and followers of Sinn Fein ostensibly oppose. On the Protestant side, we find that the Orange Order is, likewise, a tentacle of the same lurking creature. The proof is there for those who have done their homework and for those with pattern recognition skills and symbolic literacy. It is there for those who know how the Ordo ab Chao geopolitical game is played. The proof was there for me when, as a child and teenager, I watched the Orange parades that take place annually, during the month of July when the sun is at the highest point of the zodiacal arch. I later came to realize that the timing of the parades was purely astrological. After all, the color orange represents the sun that has been the insignia for every Freemasonic and Templar society descended from the Solar Cults of antiquity. It was about light then and it's about light today. The Atonist doctrine has not changed much over time. ...by a close study of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Knights of Columbus, one cannot fail to see the control that Freemasonry exercises over the Irish-Roman Catholic church – Lady Queensborough ( Occult Theocracy ) At Cong in Co. Mayo. Out in the field studying the hundreds of ancient megaliths in the area, as well as the underground caves and standing stones. The movie The Quiet Man, with John Wayne, was filmed at this location. (Click here for more info.) I began my researches into the occult history of Ireland back in the 1970s after a spate of horrific ritualistic murders of young men in Belfast was traced to upper class homosexual and pedophile officials within the British government. However, at that troubled time, no one I came into contact with could or would tell me the meaning of what I was seeing, not my school teachers who were wont to reply \"well that's way above my head there "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Michael;\" and not the many politically active family friends I knew. Atlantis, Alien Visitation and Genetic Manipulation . The result of over 20 years of study into the legends of Ireland. What I discovered changed my understanding of the world we live in. (Click here to read preface.) No one took my questions very seriously. All I received was insider-smiles, cynical rebuffs, threats, and physical abuse. I was on my own. However, I never considered abandoning my idiosyncratic investigations. The blustering of other people has never deterred me from going my own way. On the contrary, it has always reinforced my sense of independence. After twenty or more years of nonstop research into esoteric matters, I began to find out the reasons for all the strange things I had observed. Until this day, however, sad as it is to say, apart from my two Irish colleagues - Andrew Power (author of Ireland: Land of the Pharaohs ) and Jim Cairns (author of Disappeared Off the Face of the Earth ) - I've personally not found anyone else in Ireland who has been overly concerned with these vital matters. As far as I can tell, there are about three men in Ireland with a deep, legitimate, and active interest in the occult history of their land, and that includes myself. Perhaps, since the '70s, '80s, and '90s, the demographic has changed, and maybe it is slightly higher the world over. One would hope so. Nevertheless, as lonely as the road was, I knew I must continue uncovering the meanings of the symbols I saw during the Orange Order's parades and on murals, state flags, school and college decals, and civic architecture. In time, I realized that the majority of the cheery participants in the 12th of July parades, the members of the Orange Order and their liquored-up side-kicks, were largely ignorant of the deeper meanings of their own symbolism. They were lower rank lieutenants and, in the \"need to know\" level of clearance, they were uncleared . I would eventually discover that the many symbols I had noticed and been interested in (the double crosses, skulls and bones, coffins, pentagrams, dragons, lions, ladders, compasses and rules, and so on) were not limited to my insular living space. No, they were to be found throughout England, Canada, Australia, Germany, Russia, America, and many other countries of the world. They were ubiquitous but ignored by all who have been trained to look without seeing and accept without question. Another veil of ignorance was removed from my understanding in 1986 when, after venturing into the field to make detailed studies of the design and precise astronomical and geospheric positioning of Ireland's many great megaliths, I came to realize that Britain's modern cities had also been designed to align with the rising and setting of certain planets, stars, and constellations. I subsequently discovered why stars, pentagrams, and red dragons were to be found on the pavements and buildings of Belfast's Fountain Center, and why the City Hall had been purposely aligned with the ancient site known as Giant's Ring that lay four miles outside the town. I saw that there was a great purpose in the design and location of Belfast's churches, cathedrals, convents, colleges, and state buildings. My colleagues and I have discovered why certain certain towns and cities of Ireland are laid out as they are. We know that the so-called \"Battle of the Boyne\" was not a battle at all, but rather a ceremonial rite performed by royals of high degree working on an esoteric level and in complete ritual collusion. We have the proof that shows these supposed rivals to be of the same blood, banking with the same international financial concerns. We know that the captivating stories we grew up with - the contrived \"histories\" taught to us in school simply do not fit the facts. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Ireland was divided into five provinces - Ulster, Munster Leinster, Connaught and Meath. These were arranged around a central plain - the so- called navel of Ireland. This layout, like that of the towns and cities, had a special occult purpose. (Click map for more info.) Passing through the various cities of Northern Ireland (Belfast, Bangor or Derry, etc) we see what looks like the flag of Israel flying? We see the Ulster flag and large colorful murals featuring the Star of David. That is a Jewish symbol, right? That is what most people think. That is what most tourists think, and it is what most people who watch television think when they see footage of Northern Ireland. What they don't know is that the symbol originated with the Irish Druids. It is an ancient astrological symbol and has very little to do with religious Judaism. In the Irish context, it is simply the insignia of the secret societies that have been placed in charge of political, economic and religious affairs. If the symbol has anything to do with Judaism, it is only because the same secret institutions that we mention here also happen to be in control of Israel. They are behind the Israeli versus Palestinian conflict in the same way as they are behind the Protestant versus Catholic conflict. It's just business as usual for these camera-shy boys. A few days into the UWC (Ulster Workers Council) strike, loyalists planted bombs in Dublin and Monaghan, killing 33 people. Controversy still surrounds these bombings even to the present day. It has been alleged that British Special Forces assisted the loyalist UVF (Ulster Volunteer Force) in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, because the UVF did not have the technical knowledge to construct sophisticated bombs such as these - Jim Cairns ( Disappeared off the Face of the Earth ) For the first time in the present troubles, there were clear indications that the loyalist and Republican paramilitaries had begun to cooperate in certain murders when it suited their purposes. Through the lines of communication, it is suspected that the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries \"swapped\" assassinations, when either side did not want to be seen murdering members of their own communities - ibid The Star of David or, more correctly, of the \"Davids\" plural, was once-upon- a-time the star of the Irish Druids. It was a symbol of the Aryans and it signified biunity - the harmony between masculine and feminine and all other polarities. As we have explained in our book and DVD entitled The Irish Origins of Civilization, the ancient traditions and symbolic archive of the Arya has been well and truly plagiarized and cannibalized by Templars and Masons. These secret societies have assumed total control of the political institutions of the world. This is why their symbols appear on heraldic emblems, arms, and flags, as well as on corporate logos and commercial products. The flag of N. Ireland, with the Star, Red Cross, Red Hand, and Crown. These symbols are analyzed in my Irish Origins book and DVD. Whether it is the five-pointed pentagram on the flag of Communist Russia, hammer and sickle, red square, or harp on the Irish heraldry, the story is the same. The symbols represented the world's original spiritual aristocracy. They are now flaunted by the sorcerers responsible for their demise. (Click here for more information.) Since I began my researches I have never cease being amazed at how many documentaries have been made and how many books have been written on the IRA and Republican movement. To this day you can go to the bestseller tables of the world and see thick hardbacks and even coffee-table tomes on the IRA. Yet look at the dearth of information on the Orange Order? It is hard to remember when any in depth documentary on this society has appeared on mainstream channels. Of course, we might find such works in some dusty library shelf, but they are uncommon when it comes "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"library shelf, but they are uncommon when it comes to the bestseller list and the tables of mainstream bookstores, Yes, it's always IRA this, IRA that. There are biographies galore on Adams, McGuiness, and the rest of them. They are the \"rock stars.\" But when it comes to the Orange Order there is, relatively speaking, a blanket of silence. What are the faces we associate with insiders of the Orange Lodge? We can put faces to Sinn Fein and we all known what Ian Paisley looks like and stands for. We know what the Protestant paramilitaries look like. But do we know who really runs Ireland? The insignia of the wealthy and powerful Knights of Columbus, a Catholic order with influence over many Irish and American politicians. Note the Roman Fasces on their emblem. (Click here for more on the Nazi- Vatican connection.) More importantly, can we understand that one brotherhood controls both factions? Or will it take another century before that truth is accepted by the men and women whose family members have suffered and died because of their participation in a conflict they erroneously believe to be moral and legitimate? My colleague Andrew Power opened the first metaphysical bookshop in Belfast. That is how I ran into him. It was 1983. The first book I bought from him (on my dole money) was William Sterling's Canon. Andy was the only Irish man I had met who did not think I was \"bonkers.\" Sadly, his bookshop did not last long. Later Andy went on to write Ireland: Land of the Pharaohs . He dedicated his book to me and to the researcher Jordan Maxwell. That was a lovely gesture. In the book, Andy deals with the occult symbolism of the famous Battle of the Boyne. And what a strange battle it was. Did you know that nobody was killed at the Battle of the Boyne? Did you know that not a single bullet, buckle, musket, spear, or body was ever found in the area? Not even with the latest metal detectors. The entire \"battle\" was an elaborately staged Masonic ritual undertaken so that the political and dynastic power could change hands from the elites in the Stuart dynasty to their cousins in the Hanover dynasty. The site was selected because the river Boyne (named after the goddess Boann) matches the heavenly river - the Milky Way - and because it is a stone's throw from the ancient complex known as Newgrange. Within the tiny chamber of the great cairn of Newgrange, for the three days of the Winter Solstice, the light from the sun and moon unite. In front of the cairn is the original \"Stone of Bethel\" on which \"Jacob\" (the sun) rested his head. The site was extremely sacred to the Megalithic Arya - the nobility of the ancient world. (See our book The Irish Origins of Civilization for more information on this enigmatic megalithic site.)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"A Masonic banner being carried through the streets by members of an Orange Lodge, during a 12th of July parade. The image on the banner is of King William III (known as King Billy) riding into the Boyne River during the famous battle between... ...the Houses of Hanover (of Orange), and Stuart in 1690. On that day, however, the King's horse was black and not white. Furthermore, in many murals and depictions of this moment during the battle, the King's sword passes over or between the horse's ears, thus making the horse subliminally appear to be horned unicorn. As author Andrew Power pointed out, this is appropriate symbolism because, astrologically, the white unicorn was the symbol for the northerly sign of Cancer. The red lion symbolized Leo. The King's river crossing was a terrestrial analog to the celestial crossing of the star Sirius over the Milky Way, the heavenly river. The image of this star can be seen on the architecture of most Masonic halls throughout Britain and the world. My revelations concerning Ireland's true history follow on in the tradition of the researchers Conor McDari, Comyns Beaumont and Anna Wilkes. These suppressed investigators knew that man's history did not just begin 7 to 10 thousand years ago. My work, like theirs, deals with the western origins of civilization. It deals with the connections between Ireland and the pre-diluvian continents of Atlantis and Lemuria. Lemuria appears in Irish mythology under the name Murias. It was one of four great landmasses that were destroyed but which were the original homelands of the Irish or, more correctly, Arish , since the name Ireland is a corruption of Ari or Arya Land. The original Aryans were the Irish. Specifically, they were the elders of the Irish race, the Druids who were finally annihilated by their Atonist enemies. In the earliest days, before and after the grea t cataclysm that destroyed the pre-diluvian civilization, the Arya had spread from the west into Eastern Europe and Asia. Wherever they ventured, they were regarded as illumined sages. (Click here for more information.) This much is conceded even by scholars (past and present) who, firstly, did not realize where the so-called \"Celts\" originally came from and, secondly, that the term \"Celt,\" as first promulgated by Roman mythmongers, was both inaccurate and prejudicial. The true Celts were a tall, fair race, warlike and masterful...who spread their their dominion both by conquest and by peaceful infiltration over Mid-Europe, Gaul, Spain, and the British Isles. They did not exterminate the original prehistoric inhabitants of these regions - Paleolithic and Neolithic races, dolmen builders and workers in bronze - but they imposed on them their language, their arts, and their tradition, taking, no doubt, a good deal from them in return, especially in the important matter of religion. Among these races the true Celts formed an aristocratic class - T. W. Rolleston ( Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race, 1911) In my Atlantis book, I deal with some of the amazing \"Tolkienesque\" leitmotifs from Ireland's ancient legends. One such intriguing anecdote speaks of Formorian King Morc and his great tower made of glass. From his tall tower on Tory Island, this evil king and his brother Conan kept watch over the land of Ireland. This they did by way of a magic lens, a \"seeing stone,\" or great crystal. In another legend we read of the sun king Lugh (pronounced Lew ). This young king did battle with a great Formorian giant by the name of Balor of the Evil Eye. In the story, dated to over 5,000 years ago (and thousands of years before the so-called \"Israelites\" appeared in"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"history), Lugh rode out toward his rival carrying with him his only weapon - a sling. That is right. Lugh struck Balor's eye with his shot (tathlum), thereby slaying his giant nemesis, the scourge of his people. Now where have we heard that kind of tale before? Yes, whether we are talking about lost civilizations, the giants of antiquity, Tarot cards, astrology, the minstrel tradition, \"Arthurian\" legends, Biblical scripture, or modern day political machinations, Ireland's importance can no longer be downplayed or ignored, as has been the case in the past generations. In days gone by men were told they'd fall off the edge of the world if they traveled too far west. They were told this preposterous lie because the masters of the great geopolitical game feared the ruination of their own vile empires should Ireland's true reputation become known. Better it was for the tyrants of the world that Ireland's significance be forgotten. And better it would still be for them today. The time has come, however, for the Emerald Isle's true history to be revealed.
