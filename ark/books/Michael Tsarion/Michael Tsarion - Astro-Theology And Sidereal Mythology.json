It is difficult to open, prop up, and read oversized tomes in such congested areas, particularly when over-worked waitresses want to plonk down your coffee and fries right on top of the pages. It’s difficult to read a chapter of an enlightened genius’ work when frowning staff, gregarious drunks, or incessant noise compel you to finish, pay up, and get about your business. Such are the difficulties experienced while in the zealous pursuit of knowledge. However, we readily admit that the savant Gerald Massey experienced considerably greater hardships during his remarkable life. Considering his years of servitude, we wonder he wrote anything at all. However, since he did write, and since our intellectual and spiritual life has been dramatically improved due to his efforts, we can only humbly pause to extend to our peer sincere and solemn gratitude. We can only endeavor to present selected excerpts from his masterworks so that our own readers might be as inspired and illumined as we ourselves have been. An appreciative reader surmised it was quite impossible to categorize Gerald Massey’s extraordinary life under a single heading. And indeed, what could one say of the man? What dare one say? How should such a Servant of Truth be presented before the world he worked so assiduously to improve? Should he be accoladed as a poet, an adroit Shakespearean critic, or as history’s greatest Egyptologist? All would be proper and respectful honors for a man who, as an illiterate child-laborer, slaved in the silk factories of Victorian Hertfordshire."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The few vinegar and coffee stains upon his books are not lamented. We regard them as an art critic regards the cracks upon a Rembrandt canvas. They remind me of the days when Hermes himself paid a visit and when secret realms were opened. They remind me of the unique “weight” that comes with insight and knowledge. They remind me how much modern men owe the few erudite geniuses of the past. They remind me to never permit their graves to lie forgotten and unattended. Massey’s protégé, the American scholar Alvin Boyd Kuhn, lamented mankind’s penchant for historical amnesia. He lamented how men do so often forget the contributions of the Servants of Truth who, like Nietzsche’s supermen, labored to found, create, and build, rather than simply copy, invent, and neglect. Kuhn recorded his mentor’s fears not only for the future of his works, but also for the future of mankind: His fearsome apprehensions have been more than fulfilled. For its own very life the entrenched ecclesiastical system had to let his books relapse into desuetude. Yet, as affairs stand in the world today, the only chance for the survival of sane religion may be contingent upon their renaissance. Kuhn’s words could not be more true. The future of Christianity and of mankind does indeed depend upon the revelations of men such as Gerald Massey and, for that matter, of Kuhn and the other master scholars whose discoveries we present in this book. It is self- evident to us that in the place where the words and acts of the Servants of Truth live, sorcery cannot thrive. In the house of Faberge the forger's career is short. In the house of Rodin the faker is soon jobless. In the house of Aristotle the mythmonger is soon starved. We first heard the name Gerald Massey, and the term Astro-Theology, during the summer of 1980. A mentor had written the savant's name down on a scrap of paper that was carried back from San Francisco to Belfast, Ireland. However, as a penniless fifteen year old, we found it hard to procure anything by the author. No one we spoke with had heard the name and snobbish librarians proved distracted and dismissive. As for Belfast’s illustrious bookshop owners, well that is a story best left untold. In any case, that little scrap of paper with a faded name was not discarded. We knew it contained a name that must on no account be forgotten. The ages of Punk, New Wave, and Glam Metal passed. Twelve years after first hearing the name of Gerald Massey we returned to California and finally got our hands on Book of the Beginnings . Mothers have not embraced their infants as tightly or as fondly. As our readers will see for themselves, the protracted wait proved worthwhile. This book is the outcome of over 20 years of research. After reading the works of many investigators past and present, we find our respect and admiration for Gerald Massey growing all the greater. Therefore, this book heavily features his superlative contributions to the theological canon. It also features many excerpts from the equally exemplary, if forgotten, works of Massey's protégé Alvin Boyd Kuhn."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We sincerely hope our readers will personally seek out and acquire the works of Massey and Kuhn, and the other masters featured throughout this book. We trust their writings will be read over and over again, and that their superlative discoveries will be interpreted aright, seriously contemplated, discussed, and publicized throughout the world. We hope their exemplary books will be donated to libraries both public and private so that seekers of truth in every country of our world can benefit from their wisdom. THE ANCIENT CULTS OF POWER ...the very basis of mythology lies in the idolatrous worship of the solar great father, and the lunar great mother, who were the first objects of worship that the history of the race records – William Tyler Olcott ( Sun Lore of All Ages ) P eople of the world go about their business, working and sleeping, buying and selling, and worshipping in front of altars, unaware that there were once at least four great cults operating in the ancient world and that the various traditions and customs of these ancient cults were the basis for the Judeo-Christian religion. Indeed, as several investigators have pointed out, Vatican-style Latin Catholicism, and Christianity in general, is replete with pagan motifs. Protestant churchmen have labored to sanitize their version of Christianity by expunging the more obvious pagan elements. However, their efforts only suffice up to a point. They have not succeeded in their task and for good reason. To wholly erase the pagan elements from Christianity is tantamount to erasing the religion itself. The dress and ornaments of the Romish priest are borrowed from the heathens. The Phoenician priests wore surplices. Lambskin was worn by the Persian priests. The pelt, which the canons wear with the fur outward, is a memorial of the custom of the early heathens, who having killed the beasts for sacrifice, flayed them and taking the skins put them over their head with the fur outwards. On the saccos, or episcopal garment of the Russian bishops, are suspended small silver bells which were also worn on the robes of the priests of Persia...The crosier, or pastoral staff of the Pope, was also used by the Druids, and answers to the lituus of the Roman augurs and the hieralpha of the Hindoos – W. Winwood Reade ( The Veil of Isis: Or Mystery of the Druids ) We are not being irreverent or flippant when we say that there is not a single element of Judeo-Christian doctrine or dogma that did not originate in the pagan world. When Christians bend their knees before their \"Lord,\" for example, they do so unaware they reproduce a ritual once sacred to Thoth, the ibis-headed god of the moon. When Christians bury their dead beneath the ground they do so unaware they emulate the rites of the Osirian priesthood who solemnly believed a traversal of the \"Underworld\" (known as Duat, Amenta or Nekya) was necessary before a soul could transcend to higher planes of existence. When they speak of being born again in the \"blood of the lamb,\" they do so unaware they are referring to the astrological sign of Aries wherein the \"reborn\" sun appears each year. When families gather at Christmas time, when they celebrate the festival of lights, roll eggs at Easter, or dance jigs, they do so unaware of the reasons. Astrology, Sabeanism, and Uranography mean nothing to them. The revelry during familiar ceremonies provides sufficient sensational distraction. Knowledge and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"understanding are not invited. Their presence would only spoil the fun. The earliest books of our Bible are astrological, and are filled with priceless ancient wisdom told in myth, fable, and allegory - E. Valentia Straiton ( The Celestial Ship of the North ) As late as the fifth and sixth centuries, the words \"Our Lord, the Sun,\" were used by the Christians in their prayers. This same phrase was also used in the Liturgy until altered later into \"Our Lord, our God\" - Bozena Brydlova ( Io Unveiled ) The name of the Christian god derives from two words - Ja and Hovah . Ja (or Yah) refers to the male or masculine archetype and hovah refers to the female or feminine counterpart. So Christians who perpetually regard the god of Israel, of the prophets, and of Jesus, as male are quite in error. Jehovah is androgynous . But so were Ptah, Atum Ra, and Osiris. In fact a little research shows us that Jehovah was a originally a Lunar rather than a Solar or Saturnian deity. At least he was so in ancient Egypt. And the pagan priests regarded the moon as androgynous. The moon's waxing (which lasts approximately 14 days) was considered its masculine phase or cycle. The waning (that also lasts 14 days) was the moon's feminine phase. So the moon had two faces or characteristics, and so did lunar deities like Jehovah. Furthermore, the scriptures make it quite clear that Jehovah's main attribute is light. He creates the light but he also is light. He appeared to Moses as a burning bush and to Paul, John, and Constantine, as a penetrating light. Many have described Jehovah as the light that illuminates the darkness. And that at least is accurate since the moon is indeed the veritable light shining in the darkness . The moon does shine during the night when stars are out and when astronomers prepare to watch their heavenly \"flocks.\" The symbol of the moon was the horned headdress that simply emulated the shape of the lunar crescent. Moses was depicted with horns upon his head by Michelangelo who obviously knew what ordinary Jews and Christians are not supposed to know about their god, prophets, and religious traditions. Yes, many a pagan element is still to be found within the man-made religions of the world. And astrology is element number one, as several competent if suppressed investigators have labored to reveal. The very patriarchs put before us as paragons were astrologers par excellence . How is it we've not been told this in church, synagogue, and mosque? Why was this lesson omitted in Sunday School? Why do the men who benefit most from occult knowledge rebuke the layman for studying and practicing astrology? After all, if the magical arts were good enough for Abraham, Joseph, Moses, and Daniel, should they not be good enough for everyone else? But Abraham was not merely the founder of the Persians, but various authors assert that he was a great Magician, at the head of the Magi, that is he was at the head of the priesthood...in short, the whole of the Jewish system betrays judicial astrology, or, in other words, magic, in every part...There can be no doubt that judicial astrology...was received and practiced by all the ancient Jews, Persians, and many of the Christians, particularly the Gnostics and Manicheans...Eusebius tells us...that Abraham was an"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"astrologer, and that he taught the science to the priests of Heliopolis or On. This was a fact universally asserted by the historians of the East – Godfrey Higgins ( Anacalypsis , Vol. 1) Daniel is said to have lived at the court of the king of Babylon, to have been at the head of the Astrologers, Magi, and Chaldeans, and to have flourished both before and after the taking of that city by the Persians - ibid To illustrate our main point concerning the astrological roots of Judeo-Christianity, we present here a list of passages from the Bible's Old and New Testaments containing cryptic references to sidereal phenomena: ... the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God – (Ezekiel 1:1) And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east - (Ezekiel 8:16) Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was not aware of it. He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven\" – (Genesis 29: 16-17) Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his Star in the East, and are come to worship him - (Matthew 2:2) When the morning stars sang together, all the sons of God shouted for joy – (Job 38:7) And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever – (Daniel 12:3 3) And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years - (Genesis 1:14) By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens: his hand hath formed the crooked serpent - (Job 26:13) Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are. And thou sayest, What does God know? Can he judge through the dark cloud? Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven - (Job 22:12-14) Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign.

And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten – (John 6:5-13) Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring for Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? - (Job 38:31) While the lion was saying these words to the eagle, I looked and saw that the remaining head had disappeared. The two wings that had gone over to it rose up and set themselves up to reign, and their reign was brief and full of tumult. When I looked again, they were already vanishing. The whole body of the eagle was burned, and the earth was exceedingly terrified - (2 Esdras 12:1-3) And twelve kings shall reign in it, one after another. But the second that is to reign shall hold sway for a longer time than any other one of the twelve. This is the interpretation of the twelve wings that you saw - (2 Esdras 12:14-16) I, Esdras, saw upon the Mount Sion a great people whom I could not number, and they all praised the Lord with songs. And in the midst of them there was a young man of high stature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of their heads he set crowns...It is the Son of God – (2 Esdras 2:42) The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament does showeth his handiwork...There is no speech there are no words, neither is there voice heard.

He fenced it, cleared it of stone, and he planted it with grapevines. He built a watchtower on it and carved out a press.

Indeed, we can go so far as to say the entire Book of Revelation is a treatise on astrology to be understood by astrologers and no others. The author James Morgan Pryse, writing in the early nineteenth century, had already demonstrated this beyond all possible doubt. Indeed, the author Arthur Dyott Thompson who, like Madame Blavatsky, Rev. Robert Taylor and others, knew the word Hebrew truly referred to Stellar Cult adepts and their kabalistic learning and arcane language, exposed in his monumental work Mankind: Their Origin and Destiny how the entire Bible was a concoction of garbled sidereal lore. And, we might add that what goes for the Old and New Testaments also goes for the Apocrypha and the many Gnostic and Essene texts. After all, it is no surprise to us that the Essenes divided their members and order into three classes, as the ancient Irish Magi were wont to do, or that they had twelve bishops in senior positions within their order. It is not a surprise that their master was given the title \"Star,\" or that their scriptures were, like the Bible, based on the Astro- Theologies of ruined bygone civilizations. It is no surprise that recent excavations of early"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"Jewish\" synagogues in Judea have exposed architecture replete with stars and zodiacs. The initiated, who had passed through all the inferior grades, and attained the highest rank of Autops, or eye-witnesses, were called by the whole pagan world, Israelites or Hebrews. The name of Israelites, Jews, or Hebrews, did never designate a political or national body, but were the name, which, from an infinitely remote antiquity, designated...the highest order of the initiated in those holy mysteries; and to whom, and to whom alone, were committed the oracles of God - Rev. Robert Taylor ( The Devil's Pulpit ) The ordinary language of Egypt was called CBT, QBT, or GBT...The sacred language took its name from the word OBR or ABR which meant ancient times, the passage from one place to another - any transition...It meant also the explanation, the interpretation, the allegorical meaning of things. Of this word OBR, generally pronounced ABR, the word AMBR has been made. AMBRES is the name of the holy book of the holy language, and of the holy doctrine reserved for those who were initiated in the mysteries of Egypt. Now OBR or ABR is the word which...we are accustomed to pronounce AEBR. This points out the AMBRIC, HEBRIC, HEBRAIC language - Hebrew, in short the language which enables men to pass from one meaning to another, which explains, interprets, gives the allegorical meaning - Arthur Dyott Thompson By Hebrews...Moses does not mean the Israelites in general...but men, Israelites or Egyptians, who were learned in the Hebrew language, in the knowledge of AMBRES, the initiated - ibid The so-called Hebrew is but an artificial sacerdotal dialect of the ancient Irish priesthood, constructed from the Irish language for their own secret or ritualistic use and purpose - Conor MacDari ( The Bible: An Irish Book ) So we ask again why our \"teachers\" have not told us the truth about Judaism and Christianity and about the true identities of the patriarchs and prophets they habitually lionize? Why have we not been openly informed about their occult expertise and about the existence of an esoteric corpus reserved for initiates? Is it because humble churchgoers are not supposed to have a lot of choice in the matter of their own spiritual salvation? Is it because they have been gradually goaded into placing the welfare of their souls into the hands of exceptionally cunning and immoral charlatans? Is it because a power-mad, vice- ridden priesthood has habitually misused the esoteric knowledge it inherited and covets? Have the keepers of ancient arcane arts and sciences established their hierarchies of control because they wish to live and act as demigods upon the Earth? We are bound to think so, given the evidence. It is also represented in the Rabbinical writings that the souls of the Israelites had a higher origin than the souls of the Gentiles - Gerald Massey Clement (of Alexandria) argued that the leaders of the Church had been delegated by"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"God as “rulers on earth” and that people should submit to the authority of bishops and priests, who were, so to speak, authorized to keep the keys of the kingdom, with the power of discipline and judgment over what he called “the laity” – Ahmed Osman ( Christianity: An Egyptian Religion ) As we have shown in our Irish Origins of Civilization, Judaism and Christianity alike are merely branches of the \"tree\" of Druidism. And the men who composed the Jewish and Christian \"holy books\" knew this only too well. They knew their religions were merely rescriptings of Irish and Egyptian Sidereal Gnosis. As time passes, we know that this fact will become common knowledge. The truth of the matter is, gradually, being exposed. If you accept the Orthodox proposition that God wrote the Torah, then it follows that all the Torah's commands and prohibitions are the direct and true word of God, that they accurately reflect his divine will, and that, therefore, they must be scrupulously obeyed. The problem is that there is a large and growing body of credible evidence - textual, archeological, and historical evidence - that points sharply in the other direction... Richard Elliot Friedman is one of the country's most highly regarded biblical scholars. In 1987 Friedman published 'Who Wrote the Bible?', a landmark book, that methodically lays out why all nonfundamentalist biblical scholars today agree that the Torah has multiple, human authors. Friedman explains who they were, when and where they wrote the Torah, and why they wrote it. Israel Finkelstein is one of the world's leading biblical archeologists. In 2001 Finkelstein and the historian Neil Asher Silberman published 'The Bible Unearthed,' a fact-filled book that zeros in on the widening chasm between the Bible's stories and the findings of modern archeology over the past thirty years. William W. Hallo, a professor emeritus at Yale University, is a widely recognized expert on the ancient Near East. His studies place the texts of the Torah in the context of the contemporary Near East, and he offers abundant, documented evidence that the texts are not unique, but rather reflected the general customs and practices of the region and the times. Approaching the Torah from different angles, all three eminent scholars arrive at the same two basic conclusions. First, that man, not God, wrote the Torah. And second, that the stories in the Torah are not an accurate account - not even close - of the real history of the ancient Jewish people - R. D. Gold ( Bondage of the Mind: How Old Testament Fundamentalism Shackles the Mind and Enslaves the Spirit ) Eventually we will understand that the early \"Judaic\" patriarchs and prelates merely followed in the footsteps of their more illustrious predecessors, the Druids and Amenists of old. Their temples and shrines would be erected over the ancestral holy places of those masters who had gone before. The new religion would likewise be overlaid upon the millennia-old stellar gnosis. The early priests knew the importance of the zodiac and for a while they followed the arcane traditions as they had been laid down by the ancient Magi. To high mountains they retired to commune with their god. To open wildernesses and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"remote plateaus they went. From the high places of the world they closely watched the heavens. The very telescopes they claimed did not exist, and which they forbade men of science to produce and use, they raised toward man's first temple. With coveted and sequestered instruments they observed the rising and setting of the stars and constellations. They watched the sun pass over the great arch of heaven and sink each night into the depths of the underworld. From the academy of heaven they took tuition and as the heavens were divided so were their own societies partitioned. As their ancestors had been named so were they, and their institutions, renamed: POPE CARDINAL MINISTER MASTER PASTOR DEACON SEXTON BISHOP NUN MONK NOVICE MAGISTRATE MONASTERY Yes, the solar priesthood did not abandon age old practices. The Solar Cult's senior members merely transmogrified the archaic rites and customs. The sidereal tabernacle (the true holy of holies) remained holy in their eyes. Their new temples and shrines were also aligned with distant stars. They also featured stellar motifs in their architecture. The evidence showing what they were into has been kept as secret as possible and has not been advertised. It is, however, there for objective and symbolically literate men to discover: And Moses rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel – (Exodus 24:4) There are to be twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes – (Exodus 28:21) And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day – (Joshua 4:9) Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God – (Deuteronomy 27:6) And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"cubits...And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third – (1 Kings 6:2-8) As far as Christianity goes, little has changed since the days of old. The new sun chiefs (the cardinals, bishops, prelates, and clergymen) ensconced at their headquarters in Vatican City endeavor to keep their interest in the stars as secret as can be. Their worst fear is that their fraud of two millennia will finally be exposed. They fear Christians and non-believers alike will dispense with fanaticism and cynicism and discover the true roots of religion. They fear their Machiavellian despotism and insidious industry will finally be exposed and challenged by evolved men and women who choose to return to the sane and pristine traditions of their ancestors. Although the Roman Catholic Church once waged a long and bitter war on science and astronomy (particularly condemning Galileo), in general, they were quite involved in astronomy. The church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy for over six centuries, from the recovery of ancient learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment, than any other, and probably, all other, institutions - (From http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year- astronomy.html#Anchor-49773 ) The Jewish temple represented the order and harmony of the universe. Clemens Alexandrius (Strom 1.V) tells us that it contained several emblems of time, of the sun, moon, and planets, of the two Bears, of the zodiac, of the elements, and of other portions of the world - Arthur Dyott Thompson ( On Mankind: Their Origin and Destiny ) Sorcery and Priestcraft The Christian Church has left a legacy, a world view, that permeates every aspect of Western society, both secular and religious. It is a legacy that fosters sexism, racism, the intolerance of difference, and the desecration of the natural environment...Christianity has helped to create a society in which people are alienated not only from each other but also from the divine – Helen Ellerbe ( The Dark Side of Christian History ) The objective student of Christianity's origins understands what Christians, for the most part, do not understand and do not wish to understand about their religion. He understands that the senior priests and prelates of the Roman and Protestant Churches have been, at all times, closely affiliated with esoteric societies. Indeed, we can go so far as to say that Judeo-Christianity is an exoteric branch of the esoteric orders. And like Freemasonry, Judeo-Christianity has an inner as well as an outer court. It has an official face shown to the masses and also a veiled face revealed only to carefully selected initiates. It is our devout wish that, in present times, the connections between the Church and the occult orders continue to be exposed and that the veil of secrecy continues to be torn from Christianity's morbid faces. The Masons were the first priests...and as they were the persons employed to provide"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"every thing requisite for honoring the Gods, the building of temples naturally fell into their hands, and thus priests and masons were identified...Thus the Masons were an order of priests, that is, of the initiated.

Thus they became identified with the most powerful and influential body of society...they provided good houses for themselves...from superiority of intellect, the consequence of the constant use of their faculties, they acquired the sovereign power - Godfrey Higgins The sinister countenance of the Church has been the subject of many works. But few researchers have summed up the truth of the matter with greater accuracy and perceptiveness than Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky who wrote: ...there exists...another class of adepts belonging to a brotherhood also and mightier than any other they have to be ranked with the adepts of the Black Art.

She made her advance through the medium of intrigue, war, fire and sword, persecution, torture, confiscations, and death, the exemplification of force and intolerance. By such means she gained control and increase in power and the Irish Church missionaries were gradually forced to withdraw from the continent. It was only by such forcible means that she could make gains against the Irish Church whose representatives surpassed hers in every field of peaceful endeavor...in learning, the sciences, philosophy and spiritual culture – ( The Bible: An Irish Book ) The indoctrination process instigated by those responsible for birthing Christianity works well to ensure that the ideal Christian or Jew continues to exist in a perpetual state of spiritual fear and guilt. As a result of his divorce from center, such a man is impotent, subservient, faithful, and tame. He is suspicious of his own reason and prefers to accept rather than to proactively doubt and question. He believes he is empowered and upon the road to salvation. He is confident his overlords know what is right for him and he compliantly waits for these authorities to bestow whatever spiritual rewards they deem to be his due. As long as he remains obedient and faithful he can be assured the good favor of his god. Of course, should he show signs of rebellion, and should he fail to conform to the commandments set before him, he can expect wrath and punishment from god. Should he doubt or question, or should he abandon the path he is expected to walk, he can expect god to damn his very soul to eternal torment in hell. He has been told that men are born sinners and that the only hope for salvation is their complete devotion to the Church that serves god.

The Bible is now buried under so many commentaries, that the text is nothing regarded....The aggregation of large libraries tends to divert men's thoughts from the one great book, the Bible, which ought, day and night, to be in every one's hand....Never will the writings of mortal man in any respect equal the sentences inspired by God. We must yield the place of honour to the prophets and the apostles, keeping ourselves prostrate at their feet as we listen to their teaching – Martin Luther (Source: The Table Talk of Martin Luther ) Martin Luther, like so many liars and power-hungry despots of his type, belonged to a powerful occult order. The ordinary Bible reader, however, is never meant to guess that. He is merely to continue believing his Jesus to be utterly unique and that the tyrants responsible for establishing his religion were paragons. He is never meant to discover, for example, that Emperor Constantine also belonged to a powerful world wide solar order, that he was guilty of murdering at least three members of his own family, and that he remained a sun-worshipping pagan until the very end of his days. Knowing such things poses a threat to the credibility of the Church and clergy. It would expose priestly duplicity and make once ardent devotees question every other aspect of doctrine and dogma. It might compel good men to wonder whether their beliefs and allegiances have tuned them into subservient and compliant slaves to tyrants of truly demonic breed. Contrary to tradition, Constantine did not make Christianity the official state religion of Rome. The state religion of Rome under Constantine was, in fact, pagan sun worship; and Constantine, all his life, acted as its chief priest. Indeed, his reign was called a \"sun emperorship...\" and Sol Invictus figured everywhere - including on the imperial banners and the coinage of the realm. The image of Constantine as a fervent convert to Christianity is clearly wrong. He himself was not even baptized until 33 - when he lay on his deathbed and was apparently too weakened or too apathetic to protest. Nor can he be credited with the Chi Rho monogram...An inscription bearing this monogram was found on a tomb at Pompeii dating from two and a half centuries before...The cult of Sol Invictus was Syrian in origin and imposed by Roman emperors on their subjects a century before Constantine. Although it contained elements of Baal and Astarte worship, it was essentially monotheistic. In effect, it posited the sun god as the sum of all attributes of all other gods and thus peacefully subsumed its potential rivals.

Halsberghe ( The Cult of Sol Invictus ) If it can be shown, by clear and indisputable evidence, that the history of Jesus Christ (as commonly received among Christians) is a forgery and a fiction—that he was not the son of a virgin called Mary, the wife of Joseph the carpenter, who conceived through the power of the holy ghost, and ceased not to be a virgin even after she had become a mother—that he did not converse with the Jewish doctors in the temple—nor preach to the populace in Jerusalem and elsewhere—nor perform miraculous cures—nor hold communion with the devil—nor, in point of fact, do any one act that pious enthusiasts and ignorant devotees have ascribed to him; and further, that neither a god nor a man called Christ was crucified by Pontius Pilate, the Procurator, and therefore could not by possibility have arisen from the dead three days after an event which did not happen, and ascend into heaven, as is vulgarly supposed,—if, we repeat, it can be clearly proved that the foregoing assertions about the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, are idle tales, having no foundation whatever in truth—mere fictions stolen from the mythological fables of ancient nations,—the very root of the Christian system will be as nought! - J. C. Blumenfeld ( The Existence of Christ Disproved ) ... the books of the New Testament were derived from various sources, stitched together as best the editors could manage, and that the editors had been much affected by considerations of bias and propaganda in their work, suppressing or altering what did not suit their religious standpoint in the controversies of the early Church - Martin A. Larson ( The Story of Christian Origins ) The ancestors of our present day ecclesiastical degenerates were well known to the ancient adepts. They also came from a long lineage of deceivers and destroyers. The ancestors of the present day sorcerers were disciples of power rather than lovers of knowledge. The power of their spiritual office went to their heads and dominion over the minds of men became their obsession. They were students of the heavens and they knew when eclipses were going to occur and when enormously long cycles were opening and closing. They knew when constellations and special stars arose and set and when significant conjunctions were about to happen. Furthermore, their ability to read the stars enabled them to read men. They knew a man's fate and worked as oracles predicting future events. Kings and princes harkened to their instruction and their apparent clairvoyance was awed. In turn for their services they were richly rewarded. The priestly oracles, however, eventually forgot a vital fact. They forgot that esoteric knowledge comes with a price. It is never free. A mind that presumes to understand great mysteries is a mind which must be morally incorruptible. Ironically, the impure mind will eventually be damaged and corrupted by the very proximity of the truth it covets. This fact is never forgotten by a Servant of Truth. It is forgotten by a sorcerer.

Only the baleful angels remain to mingle with humans, seizing wretches and driving them to carry outrageous crime – war, looting, trickery and all that is contrary to the soul - Asclepius ( The Corpus Hermeticum ) The cunning priests and mythmongers have always sought to ensure that their unfortunate followers remain morally infected and spiritually befuddled. To this end they have plagiarized and rescripted the sacred Hermetic and Astrological canon. Although their manifesto, the Testaments, are scurrilously garbled and illogical, few are bothered. As long as the desired effects are elicited the mythmongering is zealously endorsed. The compilation, instead of being flung into consuming fires, has been sanctified and lauded as the veritable word of god. Those who once decided to refute the matter were brutally tortured and murdered. Today, they are ridiculed, branded, condemned as sinners, and ostracized. The compilers of the Old Testament...knew well that the language of the Initiates in the days of Moses was identical with that of the Egyptian Hierophants – Madame Helena Blavatsky There is nothing holy about the Bible, nor is it “the word of God.” It was not written by God-inspired saints, but by power-seeking priests. Who but priests consider sin the paramount issue? Who but priests write volumes of religious rites and rituals? No one, but for these priestly scribes sin and rituals were imperatives. Their purpose was to found an awe-inspiring religion. By this intellectual tyranny they sought to gain control, and they achieved it. By 400 BC, they were the masters of ancient Israel. For such a great project they needed a theme, a framework, and this they found in the Creation lore of more knowledgeable races. This they commandeered and perverted – the natural to the supernatural, and the truth to error. The Bible is, we assert, but priest- perverted cosmology – Lloyd Graham ( Myths and Deceptions of the Bible ) The prelates of old knew their forged canon would pay dividends.

By engendering fear of the devil, the priests secured their positions and acquired their coveted dominion over the psychology of human beings. The fear that arose within a Christian, as he contemplated what his poor soul was bound to endure if it were condemned to the infernal fires, was sufficient to send him running into the camps of his direst enemies. It was enough to turn him into the thoughtless, subservient, and obedient minion of truly nefarious men. To this very day large numbers of supposedly rational and evolved people the world over fall prey to this priestcraft. Vast numbers of modern human beings, each believing themselves to be progressive and civilized, harbor emotions of fear and guilt implanted by self-serving sanctimonious demagogues in high places.

History records that fearful wreckage - Alvin Boyd Kuhn The terrible craze that was caused by this perversion of the ancient wisdom has sown the germs of insanity broadcast, and half-filled the world with pious lunatics for whom it offers no cure – Gerald Massey It should never be forgotten that the power of the priest rests solely on the credence of the people.

In most ways his existence differs greatly from that of his predecessors. In matters of religion and superstition, however, little has changed over the centuries. In matters of religion man's intellect freezes. He regressively clings to absurdities as zealously as his illiterate Medieval predecessors. And yet, for all his recalcitrance, he cannot be wholly blamed. His beliefs about metaphysical matters have been expertly insinuated and embedded by influential men he has never seen or heard of. These hidden overlords have their underlings well trained. They have taught men to suspend their critical abilities and to be faithful and obedient. And the mannequins they control remain, for the most part, content to place their spiritual welfare in their perfidious hands. The apathetic and fearful mannequin reads about history from books and programs prepared by his duplicitous masters. He covets his assigned place in the hierarchy and feels no need to unsettle himself by asking vexatious questions about history or the meaning of life. Even apparently intelligent and inquisitive men it seems can live out their entire lives unaware that the tropes of religion are, like the myths, largely expressions of astrological metascience. All mythologies find their explanation in this starry language, and every religion is founded upon the movements of our solar system. The rise and fall of empires and races of men are written in its pages - Thomas H. Burgoyne ( The Light of Egypt: or The Science of the Soul and The Stars , Vol. II) The religious focus of the earliest known civilizations was on the sky, which was universally known to be the home of the “gods.” The sky covered the Earth, and so was called “heaven,” which means a “covering”...The myths were intimately tied to the stars through the constellations, for many myths ended with the hero being placed among the stars in the sky, a process called catasterization. Thus a constellation was said to be the image of the hero, or heroine, who had been taken to live among the gods, and be immortal – Harry Dale Huffman ( End of the Mystery ) Amenists and Druids Whether the origin of the zodiac is Aryan or Egyptian, it is still of immense antiquity. Simplicius (sixth century AD) writes that he had always heard that the Egyptians had kept astronomical observations and records for at least 630,000 years...Diogenes Laertius carried back the astronomical calculations of the Egyptians to 48,863 years before Alexander the Great. Maritanus Capella corroborates the same by telling posterity that the Egyptians had secretly studied astronomy for over 40,000 years before they imparted their knowledge to the world - J.

But even before the time of the Scythians (or more properly the Saca or Sages) the ancient Megalithic Arya of Britain and Scandinavia had emigrated to the lands of the South-West taking their expertise and traditions with them. This fact needs to be borne in mind when we read ancient scriptures, particularly those penned by Judeo- Christian mythmongers. This devious coterie not only plagiarized Astrological and Astro- Theological leitmotifs from Nile Valley mystery schools, they also plagiarized the Druidic corpus of Ireland. This is made evident from reading passages such as the following loaded with Druidic imagery: After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines; and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying – (1 Samuel 10:5-6) Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them – (Matthew 7:15- 20) The facts concerning the West to East migration need to be particularly borne in mind when we read of or consider the genius of the Egyptians: Col.

We go so far as to say that solar cultism of the unadulterated kind was not indigenous to Egypt but was transported and seeded there by visiting Westerners, namely the so-called Shemsu Hor or \"Disciples of Horus,\" properly known as the Ari or Arya. It was their colleges that spread throughout the globe before all others. It was their philosophy that inspired the minds of early European savants. And it was their sidereal knowledge that eventually became, after absorption and adaptation, the mystery traditions of Sumerians, Chaldeans, and Egyptians: The religion of the ancient peoples seems to have been one throughout the entire world; a great brotherhood, a universal faith.

Dr. Brugsch, the learned German, notices the word Tam-hou or white men. As it occurs on tablets dated 2,500 years before Christ, it is puzzling to indicate the people. Brugsch traces them to Libya.

They are apparently reluctant, however, to accept that North-Westerners brought the worship of Osiris, Horus, and Ra (and even earlier deities) to Egypt. Nevertheless, this was certainly the case. The North-Westerners were the Goths or \"Goat Men\" who gave Egypt its name.

The difference between these two groups is, to our mind, negligible.

But much as they excelled other nations in scientific lore, in nothing was their superiority so conspicuous as in that magic art - Henry O'Brien ( Atlantis in Ireland , 1834) Among the Egyptian festivals was one called the Feast of Lamps, when upon a night in winter the houses and temples were lighted up with numerous lights. This was more particularly celebrated at Sais, in honour of the goddess Neith; but those who could not come up to that city to keep the festival burnt their own lamps at home...The Jews seem to have borrowed this festival...The Christians would seem to have taken the custom from the Egyptians as much as from the Jews, as the purpose of our Candlemass day, which is to commemorate the purification of the Virgin Mary, more resembles the worship of the goddess Neith than the purification of the Temple by Judas Maccabaeus - Samuel Sharpe ( Egyptian Mythology and Egyptian Christianity )"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"From what was written thousands of years ago, it is shown that the modern-day portrait of pre-Pharaonic Egypt is distorted by overwhelming emphasis on the study of existing crumbling ruins and exotic carvings - Alvin Boyd Kuhn Caesar and other Roman writers, as well as the Greeks, knew nothing of the esoteric wisdom of Ancient Egypt, and therefore of the Druids. They perverted all that had been told them - Albert Churchward ( The Origins and Evolution of Religion ) The Druidic Order was divided into three classifications. There were Druids, Bards, and Ovates. Significantly, the Egyptian Amenists employed a similar tripartite system: The three highest ranks in Egypt were the divine, the royal, and the noble, and the three were distinguished from each other by their peculiar type of beard. Thus the loftiest rank was spiritual, and this primacy originated not in men becoming bishops, but in their possessing those spiritual powers and faculties which have been repudiated and expurgated by the Churches of orthodox Christianity, but which were looked upon of old as verily divine – Gerald Massey ( Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World ) The Egyptian priesthood was hereditary, and formed one of the three classes into which the nation was divided--namely, the priests, the soldiers, and the cultivators of the soil. They held their estates free from the land tax or rent of one-fifth of the crop, as mentioned in Gen. xlvii. 26. They were the only learned or educated people in the kingdom, and consequently they filled every post and office which needed any education. Not only every clergyman, sexton, and undertaker, but every physician and druggist; every lawyer, writing-clerk, schoolmaster, and author; every sculptor, painter, and land-measurer; every conjuror, ventriloquist, and fortune-teller, belonged to the priestly order. Even those posts in the army which required an education, such as secretaryships and clerkships, were held by priests. Much of the skilled labour of the country was under their control. The linen manufactories in the Delta, and the stone quarries between the first and second cataracts, were both managed by the priests – Samuel Sharpe ( Egyptian Mythology and Egyptian Christianity ) From the word Ovate (from the Gaelic Faidh ) come such roots and words as Faith, Fate and Vatican . So when Christians pontificate about having \"faith,\" they do so without realizing the word and idea come from the Druids, the true \"Men of Faith.\" The Ovates were judges. The word judge comes from the same roots as Judah (from Yahud ) and Jew . In all cases these titles come from Irish roots. They refer to the \"Men of the Yews,\" the Arya, or Servants of Truth who appeared in pre-dynastic Egypt as the blue-eyed, fair-skinned Shemsu Hor. The Brehon (Judges) laws of Eire were, without a doubt, the most ancient code of laws on earth. It was under the guidance and instruction of those first great teachers that there developed in the Island of Eire that cult of wise men who are know to us by tradition, and in cryptic lore, as the Ancient Magi or Magicians of Eire. This was the great Adept order of priesthood whose history has been suppressed like that of the island itself, but the memory of which is secretly preserved in mythic form in secular or profane history, and in our Irish sacred book, the Bible - Conor MacDari ( The Bible:"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"An Irish Book ) The Pope of Rome exactly resembles the Secular High-Priest of ancient Rome, and in Latin his title is the same - Pontifex Maximus. The office was probably an imitation of that of the Arch-Druid, who, as I have described, had supreme power over secular as well as ecclesiastical affairs, and who was surrounded by a Senate of the Chief Druids, as the Pontifex Maximus was by Flamines, and the Pope by Cardinals - W. Winwood Reade ( Veil of Isis: Or the Mysteries of the Druids ) As we can see from these examples, etymological evidence reveals plenty of interesting connections between the Western and Eastern schools. In ancient Wales the priesthood was known as Syw (which can be pronounced Suv, Shuva, Shuwa , etc). In Egypt the priests referred to themselves as Shaau (as in sowa or show ). The word cow comes from this root. The cow goddess was revered in both Britain and Egypt. The reference to the cow connotes the Age of Taurus when the Druidic schools were very active and prominent. The Druids worshipped deity under the form of the Equinoctial Bull, as did the early Hebrews and Egyptians, and under the form of an erect monolithic stone, the Hermetic pillar or \"gilgal,\" of which so many are found in Palestine to this day - Frank Higgins ( Ancient Freemasonry ) Moreover, the name druid comes from the same root as the word door . The Druids were, spiritually speaking, the \"door keepers\" or \"gate keepers.\" Indeed, doors were commonly made from the wood of oak trees sacred to the Druids to symbolically commemorate this connection. The idea and image of a portal between realms or to the place of the \"mysteries\" was picked up and employed by Freemasons and, significantly, a title for Egyptian pharaohs, ruti, also meant \"door keeper\" or \"gate keeper.\" Additionally, as Comyns Beaumont's writings reveal, the Egyptians were affiliated with the Phoenicians. The magnificent site at Baalbek in the Lebanon (named after the god Bel) was of Phoenician construction. Some of the stones lying at the location are so massive that no modern crane can move or lift them into place. Originally, the Phoenicians were referred to by the historians as the \"Kabiri.\" This word is correctly rendered Kab Ari , with the syllable Ari referring to the Arya of Ireland. As we showed in our book The Irish Origins of Civilization , the name Ireland was originally Ariland , the \"Land of the Arya\" or \"Aryans.\" Under the title \"Phoenician\" (from Fin , meaning \"fair,\" \"white,\" \"pleasant,\" as in fine or finesse ) the Arya, after the Age of Catastrophe, traveled abroad and established sacred colleges in numerous lands. They were the original disseminators of the elements of civilization. ...many of the gods worshipped at Memphis were considered by Herodotus to be Phoenician deities - Samuel Sharpe ( Egyptian Mythology and Egyptian Christianity ) Furthermore, one of the earliest titles or names for the sky goddess of the Irish Druids was \"An.\" This name can also be rendered Ana, Anu, Dana, Danu, or Diana.

Moreover, it was customary for the image of the goddess (the vulture or serpent, etc) to be etched or painted above the portals of most temples. The pharaoh and priests always"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"entered beneath the sign and image of the goddess. Men entered into the temple as they entered the world, via the portal of the female. A study of the shape and symbolism of church doorways and windows confirms the tradition has been well and truly carried on. As patristic as they are, latter day churchmen know how the female symbolism affects the racial memory of their unthinking congregations who erroneously imagine the Christian religion to be something divinely transmitted and utterly unique. As said, the Druidic Order was divided into three schools. Threeness was a most important archetype for the ancient Arya. It can be considered their hallmark. Significantly, it appears that from the earliest times three schools existed within the astronomical cults of Egypt. Sir Norman Lockyer discerned this from his meticulous examination of temple alignments. He wrote: To all three schools sun-worship was common, but we may clearly separate them by the associated star-worship. We have found worshippers of northern stars, east and west stars, and southern stars - ( Dawn of Astronomy ) A study of the rites of Osiris reveals the truth of what we advocate concerning the intimate ties between Druids and Amenists. We go so far, in our writings, to say the rites of Osiris ( Ausares or Aus Ari ) were probably transported to Egypt by the Western Arya. Either his worship came with the Megalithic Druids, or it came later with the Celtic Scythians. We favor the former conjecture. Osiris is a form of Herne and also of Iesa, the dying god whose sacrifice and journey into the Underworld allegedly brought new life to the land. Herne was referred to as the \"Green Man\" and Osiris (although his title was \"Lord of the Perfect Black\") was often depicted as being green of color. To the west, to the mansions of Osiris, To the west thou are going. Thou who were best among men, Who did hate the untrue - (Egyptian hymn to Osiris) Osiris came from the west according to myth. He was born from the sea. He appeared as a local god in the city of Ded in the Nile Delta. Isis was sometimes called the goddess of the west - Henry Binkley Stein ( Thirty Thousand Gods Before Jehovah ) Furthermore, there are similarities between the myths of Osiris and the Akkadian Tammuz and also the Irish Miach, an early deity connected to herbalism and nature. The connections between the myths of Osiris and Dionysus have also been investigated by many scholars. Additionally, there are numerous parallels between the accounts of Osiris' life and that of the Biblical Jesus. These have been explored at length by several researchers and historians. The comparisons have shown that the New Testament's resurrection story, for example, clearly originates with the Osirian saga that can be dated to well over 2,500 years BC. Make the King mighty in your womb. He shall not die – (Pyramid Texts, Hymn 431) There is no death in the Osirian religion, only decay and change, and periodic renewal; only evolution and transformation in the domain of matter and the transubstantiation into spirit. In the so-called death of Osiris it is rebirth, not death, exactly the same as in"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"the changes of external nature - Gerald Massey ( Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World ) We find that the doctrine of eternal life and of the resurrection of a glorified or transformed body, based upon the ancient story of the resurrection of Osiris after a cruel death and horrible mutilation, inflicted by the powers of evil, was the same in all periods, and that the legends of the most ancient times were accepted without material alteration or addition in the texts of the later dynasties. The story of Osiris is nowhere found in a connected form in Egyptian literature, but everywhere, and in texts of all periods, the life, sufferings, death and resurrection of Osiris are accepted as facts universally admitted – E. A. Wallis Budge ( The Legend of Osiris ) Osiris was the god through whose sufferings and death the Egyptian hoped that his body might rise again in some transformed or glorified shape, and to him who had conquered death and had become the king of the other world the Egyptian appealed in prayer for eternal life through his victory and power. In every funeral inscription known to us, from the pyramid texts down to the roughly written prayers upon coffins of the Roman period, what is done for Osiris is done also for the deceased, the state and condition of Osiris are the state and condition of the deceased; in a word, the deceased is identified with Osiris. If Osiris lives forever, the deceased will live for ever; if Osiris dies, then will the deceased perish - ibid Both sagas, the Osirian and the Christian, make mention of the heavenly abode and the heavenly being. However, it is the Egyptian accounts alone that make the Astro-Theological aspects of the “story” abundantly clear to readers. The version compiled by the Biblicists conceals and skews these aspects. The \"heaven\" of Christian mythmongers is not the night sky per se , but the angelic realm beyond human perception. It is an unseen fanciful abode of god. However, this adaptation does not make Christianity any less pagan in complexion. Not in the least. Any talk of \"heavens\" is Astro-Theological, regardless of the sanctimonious propaganda that would have us believe otherwise. You shall set me to be a magistrate among the spirits, the Imperishable Stars in the north of the sky – (Pyramid Texts, Hymn 519) You shall lay hold of the hand of the Imperishable Stars, your bones shall not perish, your flesh shall not sicken, O King!, your members shall not be far from you, because you are one of the gods – (Pyramid Texts, Hymn 412) The king is the son of Atum and is a star. The King's mother was pregnant with him, (even he) who was in the Lower Sky, the King was fashioned by his father Atum before the sky existed, before earth existed, before men existed, before the gods were born, before death existed – (Pyramid Texts, Hymn 571) Gerald Massey highlighted a key motif within the rites of Osiris later adapted by Christian mythmongers for their story of a supposedly mortal Jesus. He shows that the origins of the very word Christ can be traced to Egypt: ... in making the mummy the Egyptians were also making the typical Christ, which is the anointed. The word karas, kares, or karis in Egyptian signifies embalmment, to embalm, to anoint, to make the mummy. Kreas, creas, or chros, in Greek denotes the"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"human body, a person or carcase, more expressly the flesh of it; cras, Gaelic and Irish, the body; Latin, corpus, for a dead body; these are all preceded by the word karas or karast, in Egyptian...Each body that had been embalmed was KARAST, so to say, and made into a type of immortality in the likeness of Osiris...or Horus, the prototypal Christ - Gerald Massey ( Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World ) ... it is entirely false to represent the Egyptians as making the mummy and preserving it for the return of the soul into the old earthly body. That is but a shadow of the true idea cast backwards by Christianity - ibid In the same book, Massey goes further and emphasizes that Osiris was the Christ before the Christ. He was undisputedly one of the main models for the New Testament's savior who died, was enclosed in a cave, and rose again to eternal life. Again, the solar (or Astro- Theological) symbolism of the rite is conspicuous: The word krs denotes the embalmment of the mummy, and the krst, as the mummy, was made in the process of preparation by purifying, anointing, and embalming. To karas the dead body was to embalm it, to bandage it, to make the mummy. The mummy was the Osirian Corpus Christi, prepared for burial as the laid-out dead, the karast by name. When raised to its feet, it was the risen mummy, or sahu...Hence the name of the Christ, Christos in Greek, Chrestus in Latin, for the anointed, was derived...from the Egyptian word krst...Not only is the risen mummy or sahu called the karast, Osiris as lord of the bier is the Neb-karast equivalent to the later Christ the Lord...Thus the Egyptian karast was the pre-Christian Christ, and the pictures in the Roman Catacombs preserve the proof. The passing of the karast into the Christ is depicted in the gnostic iconography. It is in the form of a child bound up in the swathings of a diminutive Egyptian mummy, with the halo and cross of the four quarters round its head, which show its solar origin ... that Christ the anointed is none other than the Osiris-karast, and that the karast mummy risen to its feet as Osiris-sahu was the prototypical Christ The dogma of the incarnation was an Egyptian mystery. Baptismal regeneration, transfiguration, transubstantiation, the resurrection and ascension, were all Egyptian mysteries I n her book The Celestial Ship of the North, Mrs. E. Valentia Straiton explained that key sections of the New Testament were undoubtedly plagiarizations of content from the Amenist Book of the Dead. The Egyptian \"Book of the Dead,\" which is traced back to 4260 BC, years before the writing of the New Testament, has its foundations in the lore of the heavens and in the poetical imagery which follows the sun through the different signs of the zodiac. Many phrases, many headings of the chapters of the New Testament are similar to those in the \"Book of the Dead\" Factually, the common title - Book of the Dead - should be rendered differently. In Egyptian"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"the title is Peri-em-heru that correctly translated means \"Book of the Coming Forth by Day.\" It can even be rendered \"Book of Manifestation\" or \"Book of Resurrection.\" How could a book whose title read The Coming Forth By Day be fitly named the Book of the Dead? Something was amiss here. Someone had blundered. Yet the book dealt mainly with the great trial of the soul of the deceased in the Hall of Judgment, the Hall of Osiris; and Osiris was the Lord of Amenta, the realm of the dead, the dark underworld. He was the king of \"those in their graves.\" It was apparently the book of the typical Christian judgment, enacted in the world of souls following the demise of the body - Alvin Boyd Kuhn ( The Lost Meaning of Death ) A study of the solar and stellar temples of Druids and Amenists also reveals the similarities between the two contingents. Not only were ancient temples meticulously built, they were perfectly aligned in a similar manner to solstices, equinoxes, cardinal points, horizons, and important stars and constellations. Indeed, scientists have discovered that the Great Pyramid at Giza was aligned to the site of Stonehenge in England. Other sites in the British Isles, such as Tara, Newgrange, and Callanish, etc, have also been found to align with major sites in Egypt. Moreover, in both lands temples were dedicated to the goddess. In Britain the very design of temple sites (such as Glastonbury, Silbury Hill, Tara, Ard Macha, and Newgrange, etc) clearly indicate they were earthly representations of female breasts and womb. In Egypt it was the same story. The major temples were dedicated to prominent earth and sky goddesses such as Apt, Neith, Mut, Maat, Hathor, and Isis, etc. Indeed the most important ritual, the laying of a temple's foundation stone, was always performed by the ruling pharaoh in the company of a female representing the goddess Seshet. This goddess had to be figuratively present when the foundation stone was to be set in place. There were no exceptions to this custom. Seshet was referred to as \"the mistress of the laying of the foundation-stone.\" She was depicted with a star-shaped headdress. Many inscriptions record the stages of the precise rites undertaken during the inauguration of new temples such as those at Karnak and Thebes. One such inscription from approximately 1380 BC records the procedure enacted between Seshet and the reigning pharaoh: The hammer in my hand was of gold, as I struck the peg with it, and thou wast with me in thy capacity of Harpedonapt. Thy hand held the spade during the fixing of its (the temple's) four corners with accuracy by the four supports of heaven A shrine at the temple of Dendera (which features a striking and well known zodiac) was dedicated to the goddess Isis. She in turn represented the star known then as Sothis and now as Sirius. The temple in her name had, therefore, a dual purpose. It was built for the worship of the goddess Isis, but was also aligned with Sirius, the star observed nightly by the priests of Dendera. The shrine and temple was the \"house\" of the goddesses' servants. ...we are certain that Isis personified Sirius. That \"Her Majesty of Denderah\" was Sirius, at all events in the later times referred to in the inscriptions, but has been determined astronomically - Sir J.

These stars are easier to view and study in Northern climes. Throughout the centuries, the circumpolar region has been given numerous epithets. It has also been symbolized in a multiplicity of ways. Chiefly, the zone was depicted as an enclosed garden. Some stellar schools preferred to regard the zone as a heavenly shrine or sanctum. Indeed, the word church originally referred to this celestial garden. The word is a corruption of Taurt's name. The hard sounding letter \"Ts\" at the beginning and end of Taurt were phonetically softened to \"Ch.\" Consequently, T-aur-t became Ch-ur-Ch. This word (like the Greek circe and Gaelic kirk ) means circle. As said, it originally referred to the principle stellar goddess and her circular precinct in the polar region of space. This celestial bower was the original Asgard, Avalon, and Camelot; the original Eden, Hesperides, and Ultima Tule; the original Hyperborea, Arktos, and Arcadia. The circumpolar region, the original \"church,\" was often depicted as an enclosure surrounded by a wall or a fence with twelve posts. The female is the stellar goddess Taurt or Apt. She is often seen accompanied by animals representing various zodiacal constellations. The pale white Unicorn, for instance, was the ancient symbol for the sign of Cancer. The red Lion is, of course, the symbol for Leo. The tree within the enclosure represents the polar axis.

He was right. For example, the symbol assigned to St. John is the eagle. This bird can be seen landing beside John in the artist's rendition. This bird refers to the large constellation of Aquila which occupies the western sky, near Scorpio, Sagittarius and Capricorn. The eagle is esoterically associated with the letter \"A\" and also with royalty. Originally, it was an emblem of the Arya, the ancient astrologer Magi.

The name Ma'at (which can also be rendered Mahat, Mayat, Maut, Maht , etc) is the root of matter, material, mate, matrimony, mathematics , and measure . Throughout the ages it was never forgotten by the ancients how the biological cycles of the individual female were complimentary with the so-called \"external\" world of phenomena. In fact, the ancients preferred to consider that they lived inside the body of the goddess. In Irish and Egyptian esoteric traditions, the sun king, the prince of light, or of heaven, was merely an agent of his mother. He was a mouthpiece for her law. This fact was symbolized in various ways. It was ingeniously embedded into the mythographs and fictive accounts. The names of the heroes and characters give the truth away to those who understand the intention of the scribes. The imagery also gives the initiated person insight into the astrological dimension of the various convoluted tales. The solar hero will walk upon the waters or stand upon a mount. He will gaze upward to the heavens or address a great multitude. He will enter into combat with hybrid creatures and repose in underground grottos. He will traverse a great wilderness, be deceived and betrayed by close friends, and martyred by enemies. He will speak of his kingdom beyond the clouds and compel his closest friends to be wise like serpents. And around him will be enigmatic females. These women will be there at the end. They will be there to witness his suffering and receive and prepare his dead body for internment. They represent the wisdom being communicated to the world by the their son, the hero. From Sophia's womb he came forth and to her arms he finally returns after his light diminishes. It was Rudolf Bultmann, the German Biblical scholar, who cited certain passages in the Gospels...as interpolations of Sophia herself, put into the mouth of Christ - Caitlin Matthews ( Sophia: Goddess of Wisdom ) The Irish kings received their power and authority from the goddess. The same principle existed in Egypt for the pharaoh. Pharaohs and Irish Chieftains alike ruled as ambassadors for the goddess. In the Rig Veda of India we read of Viraj, the active feminine principle. A god had to marry with the goddess in order to be animated with “Shakti,” the embodiment or symbol of his own energy. A man could only become pharaoh if he was born, or married, to the legally accepted female. The primordial green mound upon which kings and pharaohs were crowned represented the goddess. The mounds in which the Irish kings were buried also represented her. Her image was to be found on the inside of the lids of sarcophagi in which the Egyptian dignitaries were interred. From birth to death the goddess played a part in the lives of the nobility of Ireland and Egypt. She played no active part in the lives of the Israelites of the Bible – Michael Tsarion ( The Irish Origins of Civilization ) The Druids had a reverence for conical mountains which was akin to the Semitic respect for high places, and their oak groves, judging from the popularity of sacred groves in Palestine and Syria, must have served for a similar solemn worship - Frank Higgins ( Ancient Freemasonry ) The pharaohs and kings of ancient times, particularly in Ireland and Egypt, were deemed"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"protectors of the goddess and her \"Hermetic\" canon. They were her chosen ones dedicated to her service. These ministers of her law sat upon their dragon thrones and wore the symbol of the serpent upon their heads: The Druids of Britain called themselves Snakes; the chiefs of Votan, mentioned in the Popul Vuh in Guatemala, styled themselves on the great race of the Dragon or the Snake. In later Babylon the Hierophants were reputed sons of the Serpent God. In Crete the famous image of the Serpent Goddess has been found and some call it the image of Eve. In Greece, Apollo slew the python or Serpent. In Israel, the common people were always making images of the Serpent and offering worship - Henry Binkley Stein ( Thirty Thousand Gods Before Jehovah ) The Uraeus, or royal serpent, was one of the earliest goddess emblems. In Egypt the hieroglyphic for a woman was a serpent. Furthermore, Egypt was known as the \"Land of the Tree and Serpent.\" Both symbols represented the goddess. It is not difficult to deduce, given the facts, that the so-called \"Kabalistic\" tradition, signified as it has been by a tree and a serpent, clearly derives from Egypt. It certainly does not originate with the Jews or Christians regardless of what duplicitous propagandists say. Kabalists will recall how the central path on the Kabalistic Tree of Life is made from paths assigned to the female. The Kabala of the Jews is but the distorted echo of the Secret Doctrine of the Chaldeans - Madame Helena Blavatsky As we will see in a following chapter, the image of the sacred tree was repeatedly assigned to the goddess. This tree was, however, originally a sidereal motif. It signified the polar axis of the Earth. The fruits of the polar \"tree\" were the stars and planets. Specifically, they were the stars of the circumpolar region. The primal Stellar Cult paradise was the place of one tree. The paradise or garden in Amenta (Solar Cult) is the place of two trees...These two trees appear in the Ritual as the tree of Hathor and the tree of Nut; the tree of the Earth and the tree of Heaven; the tree of the North and the tree of the East. The tree of Hathor was the tree of life - Albert Churchward ( The Origins and Evolution of Religion ) Close to the circumpolar region lies the enormous constellation known as Draco. This constellation is the heavenly serpent that figures in so many legends and myths, and which turns up in the Book of Genesis in a deliberately corrupted form. It is not, as Christians erroneously believe, a symbol of evil, but a symbol of enlightenment. It was a symbol revered by all true \"Christs\" and \"Messiahs.\" The Uraeus is a serpent issuing forth from the forehead of many gods being also an ornament of the royal crowns...The amulet of the serpent head is the symbol of the goddess Isis who is often represented by a serpent – Karel Weinfurter ( Man’s Highest Purpose ) One of the most important ancient symbols for the goddess was the serpent.

This goes for astrology, kabala, and numerology, and also for the Tarot. In fact, the very word Tarot derives from the name of Egypt's first and most ancient goddess Taurt. It is an irrefutable fact that the agents of the mother goddess were the gods of wisdom, knowledge, and language. Whether we are studying the mythologies of Ireland or Egypt the refrain is the same. Hermes, Thoth, Mercury, Ogma, Adonis, Tammuz, and Atum Ra, as well as the pharaoh himself, are ambassadors of the mother goddess, each and all. This aspect of the mythos, based as it was upon the message of the heavens, was inverted during the Christian era. The females appearing in the Bible are, more often than not, suspect and subservient objects of rebuke: And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come – (John 2:1-4) The Solar Cult ... sun worship does not appear to have existed as a distinct and wholly separate system, but was simply grafted on the older cult; and after the two became fused, the sun eventually became the dominant figure...but it is evident that as the new cults took root, new deities were created, and the scope of the religion was greatly enlarged, making it more complex and giving it a new orientation - Ernest Busenbark ( Symbols, Sex and the Stars ) In our book The Irish Origins of Civilization we addressed several important questions regarding the character Jesus Christ. The questions we looked at have perplexed every Biblical scholar and historian for generations. They are as important nowadays as they were when Christianity began. We asked: If Jesus had truly lived how is it that only two out of dozens of Christian sects (the Jerusalem and Galilean) have had details about his existence? How could these two traditions come to prominence hundreds of years after the events they allegedly recorded? And how could these two Christian traditions, schools, and writers differ on so"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"many key anecdotes about Jesus? If Jesus was the Messiah, or only begotten “Son of God,” and if as the Gospels relate, he was truly a major threat to the Herodian dynasty, to Caesar’s governors, and to the Jewish Sanhedrin, why are there no authentic records of his life in the works of either prominent historians or lesser commentators? Why do recently discovered scriptures (the Gnostic Gospels and Dead Sea Scrolls, etc), as well as various Apocryphal works, not corroborate the New Testament’s accounts on the life and times of Jesus? Why are there so many inconsistencies? Why were so many important and revealing texts considered expunged and deemed uncanonical by the founders of Christianity? Perplexing as these questions are to the layman and average Jew and Christian, they are simply solved. Their answer is obvious once we realize that the Christian Jesus as a man, and as the New Testament portrays him, did not exist. Specifically, he did not exist physically . Mythologically, however, the situation is the reverse. Jesus certainly existed mythologically . In fact, we can concede that Jesus lived physically, as long as we agree he was the sun of god in heaven and not the son of god on Earth. He lived as every solar hero and king lived, in the sky above our heads. The Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the Sun, in which they put a man whom they call Christ, in the place of the Sun, and pay him the same adoration which was originally paid to the Sun - Thomas Paine Christianity's debt to the Solar Cults of old is particularly and, if we may say so, perceptibly large. As the great investigators have shown, the major elements in the canon of solar theology are to be found in every version and variant of the Judeo-Christianity religion, both the exoteric traditions and the esoteric ones. You (Pagans) say we worship the sun; so do you – Tertullian (Early Christian and Bishop of Carthage) The similarities between Christianity and Mithraism in the Fifth Century were so striking that St, Augustine grudgingly confessed the priests of Mithra worshipped the same deity as he - Tony Bushby ( The Bible Fraud ) Every detail of the Sun myth is worked into the record of the Galilean teacher – Richard A.

King of Heaven, prince of Creation, sun of the eastern sky who appeared both to the dead in Hades and to the mortals upon earth he, the only true Helios, arose for us out of the highest summits of Heaven - Melito of Sardis (second century theologian) Charles Francois Dupuis, in his Origin of Worship, one of the most elaborate and remarkable works on mythology ever penned, shows that nearly all the religions of the world, including Christianity, were derived largely from solar worship. All the solar deities, he says, have a common history. This history, summarized, is substantially as follows: \"The god is born about December 25th, without sexual intercourse, for the sun, entering the winter solstice, emerges in the sign of Virgo, the heavenly Virgin. His mother remains ever-virgin, since the rays of the sun, passing through the zodiacal sign, leave it intact. His infancy is begirt with dangers, because the new-born Sun is feeble in the midst of the winter's fogs and mists, which threaten to devour him; his life is one of toil and peril, culminating at the spring equinox in a final struggle with the powers of darkness. At that period the day and night are equal, and both fight for the mastery. Though the night veil the urn and he seems dead; though he has descended out of sight, below the earth, yet he rises again triumphant, and he rises in the sign of the Lamb, and is thus the Lamb of God, carrying away the darkness and death of the winter months. Henceforth he triumphs, growing ever stronger and more brilliant. He ascends into the zenith, and there he glows, on the right hand of God, himself God, the very substance of the Father, the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, upholding all things by his life-giving power\" - John Remsberg ( The Christ ) Christians have been deliberately conditioned to regard their religion as \"monotheistic.\" Apparently, they do not realize the word refers to the amalgamation of several gods.

The Solar Cult priesthood merely adopted and adapted traditions of the parent cults it was attempting to separate from and suppress. And since Christianity is an outgrowth of solar cultism, it follows that its traditions are not unique. Christianity's traditions are adulterations of the teachings of the Magi.

For in the trinity of Osiris, Horus, and Ra, which three are one, the first person is imaged in the likeness of both sexes. Osiris as male with female mammae is a figure of the nourisher and source of life, who had been from the beginning when the mother was the “only one”...The oneness of the godhead unified from all the goddesses and gods was finally compounded in this supreme one inclusive deity, in whom all others were absorbed - Gerald Massey ( Ancient Egypt: Light of the World ) To Judaism Christians ascribe the glory of having been the first religion to teach a pure monotheism. But monotheism existed long before the Jews attained to it. Zoroaster and his earliest followers were monotheists, dualism being a later development of the Persian theology. The adoption of monotheism by the Jews, which occurred only at a very late period in their history, was not, however, the result of a divine revelation, or even of an intellectual superiority, for the Jews were immeasurably inferior intellectually to the Greeks and Romans, to the Hindus and Egyptians, and to the Assyrians and Babylonians, who are supposed to have retained a belief in polytheism. This monotheism of the Jews was chiefly the result of a religious intolerance never before equaled and never since surpassed, except in the history of Christianity and Mohammedanism, the daughters of Judaism. Jehovistic priests and kings tolerated no rivals of their god and made death the penalty for disloyalty to him. The Jewish nation became monotheistic for the same reason that Spain, in the clutches of the Inquisition, became entirely Christian - John Remsberg ( The Christ ) Mr. Massey's words show that monotheistic-type cults existed before the time of Christianity, and that hybridized Christianity is little more than a continuation of solar cultism. They show that the characteristics of early \"monotheists\" (Akhenaton's Atonists for instance) have been well preserved behind the facade of Christianity. His words have been confirmed by the recent findings of several investigators who have labored to show that the world's first so-called \"monotheists\" (the Israelites) were not the sorry bunch of ne'er-do-wells portrayed in the scriptures.

References to the mount appear in the scriptures. The image of the sun king Jesus standing upon the mount derives from the canon of the Solar Cults. Christians have still to understand that Jesus was not a physical person. He was personification of the sun. His story, like that of most mythical heroes, is Astro-Theological. original monotheists) were no more monotheistic than the Christians who inherited their cultic traditions. That piece of propaganda fools no serious student of antiquity. The word aten or athen is a very old word for the \"disk\" or \"face of the sun,\" and Atenism was beyond doubt an old form of worship of the sun. But there were many forms of sun-worship older than the cult of Aten, and several solar gods were worshipped in Egypt – E. A. W. Budge ( Tutankhamen: Amenism, Atenism, and Egyptian Monotheism ) Amenhetep IV attempted to establish a positive religion, and as a religious innovator he spoke and acted as if he were divinely inspired and had a divine revelation to give to men, and in every way he tried to depart from the traditions of the past. He never realized that if his religion was to take root and flourish it must be in contact all along the line with the older ideas and practices which he found among his people. Religion did not begin with him in Egypt. He failed in his self- appointed task because his religion did not appeal to the tradition and religious instincts and susceptibilities that already existed among the Egyptians, and because he would not tolerate the traditional forms in which their spiritual feelings were embodied - ibid It is impossible for Amenhetep IV to have indulged in the philosophical speculations as to the unity of God, with which he is sometimes credited, but which were only evolved by the Greek philosophers a thousand years later. It is, however, very probable that he wished Aten, as the god of absolute truth and justice, to become the national god of Egypt and divine ruler of all the countries of the Sudan and Western Asia that formed his dominions. If that be so, he was born too late to bring this about, even supposing that he was physically and mentally fit to undertake such a task - ibid About 1945, Dr. John Haynes Holmes, of the Community Church in New York City, preached and printed two sermons...The first was entitled: “Christianity’s Debt to Judaism: Why Not Acknowledge It?”...His other sermon was entitled: “The Religion of the Pharaoh Akhenaton.” In it he expatiated upon the singular historical fact that at a date some thirteen hundred years B.C. the young son of Amenhotep, coming to the throne before the age of thirty, introduced into the priestly religion of old Egypt the elements of a reform movement which on examination prove to fall so closely in line with the highest, purest and truest character of Christianity that Dean Weigal, of the Yale Divinity School, has pronounced them fully equal in spiritual loftiness to anything in Christianity – Alvin Boyd Kuhn ( The Case of the Missing Messiah )"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The self-begotten and all-powerful sun god can be found referred to in the scriptures and traditions of dozens of civilizations.

And this holds true even if there is but one god working his magic. Indeed, Jehovah's adoring disciples state openly that their god's primary attribute is light. The Book of Genesis opens with the following verse: And God said, Let there be light, and there was light. God saw that the light was good. We need only read the scriptures themselves to uncover the true origins of Judeo-Christianity: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all – (1 John 1:5) There is no night there; no need for lamps or sunlight, for the Lord God is their Light – (Revelation 22:5) Yahweh placed his Hand on me; then I looked and saw a great Spirit from the north; a great cloud surrounded by Light and flashing Fire...I was what looked like Fire - a radiant disc of Light – (Ezekiel 1:3-28) For all who fear My Name, the Sun of Righteousness shall shine with healing in its rays – (Malachi 4:2) "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"In Thy Light we see the Light – (Psalms 36:9) Send forth Thy Light and Thy Truth to be my guide – (Psalms 43:3) Be ready to receive the rewards of My Kingdom; the perpetual Light which will shine in you for ever and ever – (2 Esdras or 4 Ezra 2:35) If thine eye be single, your whole body will be filled with Light – (Matthew 6:22) The night is far spent, the day is at hand, let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on an armor of light - (Romans 13:12) He makes the breath His messenger and flames of fire his ministers – (Psalms 104:4) The people who walked in darkness have seen a great Light – (Isaiah 9:2) He is my Sun, and His rays have lifted me up; His Light has dispelled all darkness from my face – (Odes of Solomon, 15:12) When it comes to the Biblical Jesus, we find that there is not a single shred of evidence confirming either his physical existence or his spiritual uniqueness. The great historian Edward Gibbon questioned why the many miracles of Jesus were not recorded by historians living at the time. He knew that a real man, who had discoursed on philosophy with temple priests at twelve years of age, who had brought dead men back to life, and who had calmed storms and walked upon the waters, would certainly have merited the interest of historians: But how shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and philosophic world, to those evidences which were represented by the hand of Omnipotence, not to their reason, but to their senses? During the age of Christ, of his apostles, and of their first disciples, the doctrine which they preached was confirmed by innumerable prodigies. The lame walked, the blind saw, the sick were healed, the dead were raised, demons were expelled, and the laws of Nature were frequently suspended for the benefit of the church. But the sages of Greece and Rome turned aside from the awful spectacle, and, pursuing the ordinary occupations of life and study, appeared unconscious of any alterations in the moral or physical government of the world. Under the reign of Tiberius, the whole earth, or at least a celebrated province of the Roman empire, was involved in a preternatural darkness of three hours. Even this miraculous event, which ought to have excited the wonder, the curiosity, and the devotion of mankind, passed without notice in an age of science and history. It happened during the lifetime of Seneca and the elder Pliny, who must have experienced the immediate effects, or received the earliest intelligence, of the prodigy.

A. Giles) ...not only were there over thirty Sun-god figures in the cults of the various nations of old, but there are immediately in the Bible itself, in the Old Testament, some twenty more Sun-god characters under the very name of Jesus! Are we speaking arrant nonsense or sober truth when we make a claim which seems at first sight so unsupportable? Twenty Jesus characters in the Old Testament! Let us see. We have noted the many variant forms of the Jesus name. There are still others in the Old Testament, never suspected as being related to the name of the Christian Redeemer. There are Isaac, Esau, Jesse, Jacob, Jeshu, Joachim, Joshua, Jonah and others. All these are variant forms of the one name, which has still other forms among the Hebrews in secular life, Yusuf, Yehoshua, Yeshu, etc. Joshua, Hosea and Jesse are from this name indisputably. A few might be the subject of controversy - Alvin Boyd Kuhn ( The Great Myth of the Sun Gods ) Fully five thousand years before a Hebrew maid Mary nursed an infant of Nazareth the haloed Madonna and the Child were extant in Egypt as Isis holding her infant Horus. On the walls of the temple of Luxor, at a date as early as 1700 B.C. there were carved four scenes which have been reproduced in the Gospels as first-century Christian history. The first scene depicts a group of angels on a cloud making the annunciation of the coming of the Messiah King to a band of shepherds in the fields. The second represents a single angel announcing to a young maiden that she is to be the mother of this coming King. A third pictures the Nativity scene, with the two animals, the ox and the ass, present.

So Christas could hardly have been Jesus Christ – John G. Jackson ( Pagan Origins of the Jesus Myth ) In his Evolution of Christianity, Mr. Rylands contends that the name Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew Joshua. Joshua, it seems, was an ancient sun-god, who was demoted to the status of a man by the priests of Yahweh cult. However, the worship of Joshua was continued in secret by his devotees, until the fall of Jerusalem. After that event, secrecy was no longer necessary, so that the Joshua cult again came out into the open. The sacrificed Jesus, or Joshua, according to Robertson and Rylands, was not a historical personage, but a character in a mystery play - ibid As we will see in the following chapters, the Jesus character was a representation of the sun. He was based on Iesa of the Druids, and on Horus of the Egyptians. In every case, he was the solar king negotiating the trials and tribulations of the four seasons and twelve houses, finally undergoing a \"crucifixion,\" subterranean internment, and glorious resurrection. From twelve to thirty years of age there is no record on the life of Horus. From twelve to thirty years of age there is no record on the life of Jesus. Horus at thirty years of age became adult in his baptism by Anup (Anubis). Jesus at thirty years of age was made a man in his baptism by John the Baptist - Gerald Massey ( Ancient Egypt: Light of the World ) The first phase of the Solar Cult was that of Tem and Tum brought on from the Stellar and Lunar Cults under the name Atum-Iu as the child (Tem) and Atum Ra as the father (Tum); it was far older than the Osirian Cult, which might be termed a continuation of it under different names. Iu was another name for Tem, who proclaims himself to be the Sayer...He ways \"I have come forth with the tongue of Tum and the throat of Hathor that I may record words of my father Tum with my mouth, which draweth to itself the spouse of Seb.\" That is the mother on earth who was represented in this Cult as Hathor-Iusaas.

The River Thames in London is named after this latter deity. Horus or Tem are often seen sitting in the center of a boat traveling along the sacred river. In the Christian corpus, Tem turns up in the New Testament as Thomas the Twin. Of course, the Christian mythographers obliterated the archetype. Their Thomas is presented not as a Christ or sun king, but as a doubter. Gerald Massey The mass of people who are Bible-taught never get free from the erroneous impressions stamped on their minds in their infancy, so that their manhood or womanhood can have no intellectual fulfillment, and millions of them only attain mentally to a sort of second childhood - Gerald Massey In this book, we frequently refer to the masterworks of the great American scholar Alvin Boyd Kuhn. We now, more properly, introduce to the reader the sage who inspired Kuhn, namely the self-taught Scottish genius Gerald Massey. Massey wrote several monumental works on Egypt and the ancient Cults of old. His encyclopaedic knowledge of Egyptian theology prompted him to expose the ideological travesties which lead to the rise of Judeo-Christianity. We list his works here and will be certain to consult Massey as we continue to explore the facts concerning the sorry birth of Judeo-Christianity. The highly recommended works of Gerald Massey are the following: Ancient Egypt: Light of the World (2 Vols) Book of Beginnings (2 Volumes) Natural Genesis (2 Volumes) Gerald Massey's Lectures In one clear and powerful paragraph, from his masterwork entitled Ancient Egypt: Light of the World , Massey reviews the damage done to the esoteric canon: Gerald Massey (1828-1907). Author, poet, Egyptologist, and Chief of the Most Ancient Order of Druids. The secret of the ancientness and sanctity of the writings is that they were originally Egyptian, like the Jewish community. They are not the product of any ground-rootage in the land of Judea. They come to us masked and in disguise. The wisdom of old, the myths, parables, and dark sayings that were preserved, have been presented to us dreadfully defeatured and deformed in the course of being converted into history. An exoteric rendering has taken the place of the esoteric representation which contained the only true interpretation The main point made by Massey concerns the debt owed by Christianity to the esoteric"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"traditions of Egypt. To appreciate the amount and significance of the debt, proofs of plagiarism will now be presented. We remind the reader that it has been by way of inconceivable mythmongering and egregious adulteration that the corrupt men of present- day religious institutions have risen to the level of demigods. The miasma of spiritual confusion and angst experienced both by the devout and the non devout, which drives men to commit acts of greater and greater folly, is a direct effect of thinking and emotion being infected by the poison of the forgers and plagiarists we seek here to expose. Those who have sought to undermine human reason must stand to have their heinous industry scrutinized and critiqued by men such as Gerald Massey. They must stand to have their \"tree\" known by its \"fruit.\" Their artifice must endure close examination. The man who confirms for himself that Christian traditions are indeed the result of forgery and plagiarism, is empowered to stand up before the world, and before the insidious vice- ridden sorcerers and demand explanation as to why the esoteric or, more correctly, Astro- Theological traditions have not been openly referenced by those who have accepted responsibility for man's spiritual evolution. For what kind of priest or prelate can boast himself worthy of trust after he and his dastardly compatriots have been exposed once and for all as irredeemable liars and cheats? An ignorant explanation of the Egyptian sign-language was begun by the Greeks, who could not read the hieroglyphics. It was repeated by the Romans and has been perpetuated by “classical scholars” ever since – Gerald Massey ( Ancient Egypt: Light of the World ) Jehovah, Elohim, and the Trees of God For Jehovah is the synthesis of the Seven Elohim, the eternal center of all those attributes and forces, the Alei of the Aleim, and the Adonai of the Adonim - Madame Helena Blavatsky ( The Secret Doctrine ) Although Ptah was the creator god, he had seven assistants. The Egyptians referred to these lesser creator gods as the Ali or Eli, and also as the Ari. These helpers are found in the Book of Genesis as the Elohim: When the Elohim said, \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,\" there were seven of them who represented the seven elements, powers, or souls that went to the making of the human being who came into existence before the Creator was represented anthropomorphically, or could have conferred the human likeness on the Adamic man. It was in the seven-fold image of the Elohim that man was first created, with his seven elements, principles, or souls, and therefore could not have been formed in the image of the one God – Gerald Massey ( The Hebrew and Other Creations Fundamentally Explained ) The seven elemental powers then furnished his seven constituent parts, or seven souls, as co-workers with Ptah, and merged themselves in Atum or were absorbed in created man - ibid "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Ptah is portrayed in the monuments as the creator of the seventh, or human soul - ibid The Biblical Jehovah was a composite of the original Elohim.

We showed that its origin was to be found in the ancient language and religion of Ireland. We can now add that the same applies for Elohim . This word, used in the Old Testament over 2,500 times as a name for god, is actually a corruption of the \"Hebrew\" Aleim or Alim, which can be correctly rendered Elm . The elm, ash, and oak (as well as the rowan, yew, pine, myrrh, myrtle, acacia, olive, almond, fig, and palm) were sacred to the adepts and emperors of the world. In the Far East, the Indian gods (such as Krishna, Buddha, Siva, Durga, etc), are frequently depicted beneath a leafy tree, seated upon a lotus flower, or holding a pine cone. In Egypt we see depictions of the pharaoh and the gods in close proximity to the sacred papyrus plant. In Rome the victorious were crowned with bay or laurel leaves. Early Spartans laid the dead upon olive leaves and palm branches. The male palm was a necessary accompaniment of all phallic and solar festivals and was used prominently in temple decoration. It is found repeatedly on ancient coins and tablets, always with seven branches. In Egypt a palm branch was an emblem of Thoth, the scribe of the gods. The branches were carried in religious processions as symbols of self-creation, time, and perpetually because they were said to add one new frond with each change of the moon. In the Book of Revelation palms seem to possess the same significance - Ernest Busenbark ( Symbols, Sex and the Stars ) The elm tree's name is the origin of the god name El, itself merely a variation of Al. It also appears in Allah . So, let us realize that when we read the names of god in the Bible, and in the scriptures, and when we hear of sacred gardens and groves, crucifixes and thorny crowns, trees of life and trees of knowledge, we are hearing about Druidic iconography. When we read of twelve tribes, the burning bush, an orally transmitted law given at the foot of a sacred mountain, or a serpent standard raised in the desert, and a kabalistic tree of ten holy zones and three branches, we are, whether we realize it or not, hearing about the archaic signs and symbols of Druidism:"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"In Ireland certain very famous trees, usually yew trees, were closely connected with the tribes in whose territory they stood. They were held as sacred, and served as tribal meeting places. This custom was pagan in origin, but the trees continued to be held in reverence in Christian times. When Christianity was introduced, pagan sacred sites were often converted into Christian sacred sites – Alexander Stewart ( A Highland Parish or the History of Fortingall , 1928) In the religious history of the Aryan race in Europe the worship of trees has played an important part. Nothing could be more natural...From an examination of the Teutonic words for “temple,” Grimm has made it probable that amongst the Germans the oldest sanctuaries were natural woods...tree worship is well attested for all the great European families of the Aryan stock – Sir James George Frazer ( The Golden Bough , 1922) In the Book of Genesis we read that Jacob gathered up all his people's idols and dutifully buried them beneath a great oak. We might wonder why he did not bury god himself given that Jehovah and Elohim were named after the sacred trees of pagan idolaters. And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem - (Genesis 35:4) There is a tradition among the Jews that the tree of knowledge was named Dar and that this was supposed to be the oak, whence Dar, in Irish, means “an oak;” it also implies “wisdom” – Dudley Wright ( Druidism: The Ancient Faith of Britain , 1924) A Babylonian cylinder seal discovered by George Smith.

Curiously, the word tree and the word three are almost identical. Astarte. Some legends hold that the god of the tree (Jehovah, Elohim, etc) created woman not as a companion for man but as consort to himself . He wished to mate with her, and from their union came man. Ergo, woman is not man's equal or wife, but his superior . In the Bible, the role of the female was drastically altered. She was no longer the consort and equal of god, but a disobedient miscreant who led man, his first creation, into sin and perdition. To be in the presence of a tree or serpent means to be near god. A woman shown in close proximity to either, is in the company of god, her creator, consort, and lover. (See Tarot Arcanum II, the High Priestess.) The woman and the tree motif appears in mutilated form in the Bible's account of Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene standing near to the cross on Golgotha. The tree became an instrument of torture, and the tree- god is not a lover or consort, but a dying son. Instead of a single triform tree, there are three separate crosses. The imagery was plagiarized from the Nordic (Aryan) saga of Odin. The name Mary (from Myrrha and Meri ) may derive from the tree-name Myrrh.

The Masons are unworthy preservers of the traditions of the Druids. Above: The columns seen on so many state and civic buildings represent the trunks of trees. The floral motifs on the capitals also suggest the sacred trees of old. Long before Jews and Christians adulterated the pristine mythograph, the archetypes of the great tree and primal parents were well known to the world's ancient civilizations. Indeed, volumes have been written on the global phenomenon of tree worship. At this point we can merely point out that the names of the Jewish and Christian god (Jehovah, Yahweh, and Elohim) derive from the names of trees . The central trees seen in the Grecian illustrations represent god. In Gaelic the word duille meant \"god\" and also \"leaf.\" The fact that one illustration depicts a triform tree is most suggestive. The male and female characters on either side of the tree (in this case Dionysus and Minerva) appear in the Christian corpus as Adam and Eve. Dionysus was based upon the Irish Iesa or Esus. His name is more correctly rendered Adon Esus . Adon was the chief Phoenician god while Esus was he chief Druidic deity. The god and goddess, the tree and serpent, and the grove (or garden), are all Druidic antetypes. Their existence in European and Asian cultures was due not to Aryan \"Invasions\" as duplicitous historians perpetually insinuate. Rather, they were due to Aryan Migrations.

The tree is divided according to the 3-4 ratio and is conspicuously phallic. Indeed the first letters of Jehovah and Yahweh (the Yod or Yudh ) were alphabetical sigils of the phallus and tree trunk. The serpent sits beside the female party because it was a feminine initiation symbol. The horns on Adam signify him as a Goth, that is, a man from Western lands. When Mr. Smith told the British public that this scene was certainly a pre-Biblical representation of the Adam and Eve story he was, metaphorically, jumped on and castigated by the pulpit of the entire Anglo-Saxon world - Frank Higgins ( Ancient Freemasonry ) The incarnate god was probably representative of a god or spirit of earth, growth, or vegetation, represented also by a tree. A symbolic branch of such a tree was borne by kings, and perhaps by Druids, who used oak branches in their rites. King and tree would be connected, the king’s life being bound up with that of the tree, and perhaps at one time both perished together. But as kings were represented by a substitute, so the sacred tree, regarded as too sacred to be cut down, may also have had its succedaneum. The Irish bile or sacred tree, connected with the kings, must not be touched by any impious hand, and it was sacrilege to cut it down – J. A. MacCulloch ( The Religion of the Ancient Celts ) Another tree of immense religious and mythical significance is the ash. The Syrian goddess Asherah's name derives from this tree and its veneration. This goes for the Babylonian and Akkadian Astarte or Ashtoreth. This goddess is identical with the Egyptian Taurt. Indeed, the name Astarte is correctly rendered Ash Taurt . Asherah's (Ash Eri's) worship was, of course, frowned upon by the Biblical patriarchs. The prophet Jeremiah supposedly castigated his followers for their veneration of this goddess of \"heaven:\" Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger - (Jeremiah 7:17–18) ...to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes - (Jeremiah 44:17) Ezekiel complained that Jewish women spent much of their time \"making hangings for the groves\" (Ezek 16:16) - Ernest Busenbark ( Symbols, Sex and the Stars )"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The name of the ash tree can be discerned in the place name Assyria (Ash Arya). The Assyrian King Ashur may have been given this title because he was considered a \"god,\" that is a high- born king and priest. One of the oldest cities in Southern Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq) was Lagash. This name also contains the syllable of the ash tree. Lagash (from Lagas ) was constructed over 3,000 years BC and it served as a capital of the Sumerian (Sum Arya), Akkadian, and Guti (or Gutean) empires. Lagash and the surrounding lands were frequented (from 2150 BC) by a race known to historians as the Guti. Officially, little is known of their origins. However, there can be little doubt that the Guti were identical with the Goti, the \"Good Men,\" \"God Men,\" or \"Goat Men\" of Western climes. The Gotis' original home was officially believed to have been the Zagros Mountains in Eastern Iraq. This vast range of mountains takes its name from Sagarthians , which connotes the Saga or Saca, namely the Celtic Scythians. (A name for Eastern Scythians was Massagetae). The ancestors of the Scythians were we believe from Britain and Scandinavia. In any case, as we said, the word god comes from gott, connoting \"goat.\" In ancient days the goat was one of the chief symbols for deity, particularly among Western tribes. The goat-like image of god is still preserved by secret societies such as the Freemasons and Knights Templar. Their icon known as \"Baphomet\" harkens back to the religion of the Druids and Goths. The word is made from Baphe (meaning \"baptism\") and Metis (meaning \"wisdom\"). The great kings of Lagash were Sargon and, after his time, King Gudea. This latter king's name clearly derives from gut or goth, connoting \"god,\" \"goat\" (Swedish get ), and \"good,\" as in Gotland meaning \"good land.\" Not surprisingly, discoveries made at Lagash and Nineveh (from Nin Oph or \"Place of Nine Serpents\") confirm that the Sumerian kings were master astrologers: The great Sumerian King Gudea (2142-2122 BC). The name not only derives from the root gut , got , or get , meaning \"goat,\" but it is decidedly and suggestively similar to Judea . This is not so remarkable when the true meaning of the words Judea and Jew is contemplated. They did not refer to race but were titles. They referred to the yew tree or, more specifically, to \"Men of the Yew,\" that is to the Western Arya. A secondary connotation of Judah and Jew was \"Judge.\" And King Gudea can certainly be considered a \"Judge\" among his people. Additionally, the syllable dea, in his name, might refer to \"holy\" or even to \"god.\" The name Gudea, then, could have meant \"Holy Goth\" or \"God of the Goths\" (or \"Goat Men\"). In spite of the atmosphere of myth that came to enshroud him...Sargon was a historical monarch and founder of a great empire...What may be termed the scientific literature of the library of Nineveh makes frequent reference to him, and we learn that it was for the great library that he established in his capital city of Accad that the two standard Babylonian works on astronomy and terrestrial omens were originally compiled. The"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"work on astronomy was entitled: “The Observations of Bel,” and consisted of no less than seventy two books, dealing with such matters as the conjunction of the sun and moon, the phases of Venus, and the appearances of comets – Professor A. H. Sayce ( Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion, As Illustrated by the Religion of the Ancient Babylonians , 1887) Probably the purest system to us is that that may yet be derived from Chaldean sources. This sacerdotal caste were the most perfect in their astral conceptions and complete in their symbolic system of recording, and if the great work found in King Sargon’s library in seventy tablets is ever translated, it will prove of priceless value to the student of these weird, but sublime, astrological mysteries – Thomas H. Burgoyne ( The Light of Egypt ) The so-called Libation Cup of Sumerian King Gudea. Found in the ruins of the ancient city of Lagash. The cup features twin guardian dragons and a caduceus representing the Serpent Priests and their knowledge. An Assyrian king with horned helmet and pine cone. Certain trees such as the ash, pine and cedar were extremely dear to the ancient priest kings. Investigators tend to believe the pine cone represented the third eye and spiritual enlightenment. It denoted Dionysus, and also senior adepts and \"messiahs\" (anointed kings). It was used by several races to represent virility and potency. As an \"eye\" symbol it would have been the equivalent of the so-called \"Eye of Horus.\" The ash tree was especially venerated and featured in Nordic traditions. The Nordic Yggdrasil or \"Odin's Tree\" was conceived as a great everlasting ash. The gods of Scandinavia were known as the Aesir or Asir, a word very close to Asir (the Egyptian rendition of Osiris). "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Akkadian King Sargon (or Saru Kin) the Great (2270 BC – 2215 BC). He overthrew the Sumerian empire and he controlled Mesopotamia for approximately 150 years. His capital city was Agade (from gade meaning \"gate\" but perhaps also \"goat\"). He was purported to have been the builder of Babylon (\"Gate of the Gods\"). His name may mean \"Lord Sun,\" \"Lord God,\" or \"Lord of the Garden,\" since gan meant enclosed garden, and since one of his main official titles was \"Lord Digger of the Earth.\" Additionally, we can surmise that gardens and trees etc, were important to Akkadians and Sumerians since the pictograph for their great city of Lagash was, again, a garden. The realm of the Nordic gods was known as Asgard, with the syllable gard meaning \"grove\" or \"garden.\" The name of the Titan Atlas may also derive from ash. Atlas was often seen holding a globe, but he was given the titles of \"the wizard,\" and \"guardian of the heavens.\" According to tradition, Atlas was the son of Gaea the Earth Mother or Goddess. Interestingly her Roman name was Terra which derives from Eri, the goddess of Ireland (or Eire). Did Atlas hail from Ireland or was Ireland Atlantis? The questions are open. Atlas held up the heavens much in the same way as did the great Nordic ash tree Yggdrasil. He was related to the Hesperides, the nymphs who watched over the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"sacred apples of immortality. One of Atlas' daughters was named Maera (Ma Eri). Traditionally, the name Atlas means \"the first.\" The place name Italy derives from Atlas. The word altar may derive from alder, another tree sacred to the ancient adepts. The speculation is strengthened when we remember that the vast majority of temples and churches feature, in one form or another, tree motifs. Regardless of whether it is the tall ribbed Doric or Ionic columns of a building or the floral motifs on the architecture, it is old \"gods\" that are being subliminally honored. The term alderman certainly derives from alder. An alderman would in bygone days have been identical with a Druid priest. Indeed, the word"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"mayor is near to the Irish mayo , which denotes yew trees. The word Chaldean might be a derivation of the alder, given that the \"Ch\" served as the English \"the\" or French \"le.\" The name may also have meant \"The Elders.\" In any case, the Chaldeans were the great Magi of Mesopotamia. It is known that the Chaldeans were tree venerators: ...certain cuneiform texts seem to prove that the Assyro-Chaldeans were acquainted with a “Tree of Life.” Whether it was thus styled because it served as a simulacrum of the Goddess of Life, or whether it represented this divinity by reason of its own mythical function, the fact is none the less certain, according to Mr. Sayce, that the “divine Lady of Eden” or Edin, was termed in Northern Babylon, before receiving from the Semites the name Bab Ilu, the “Gate of God”...in the old language of the country, Tintirkel, or Dintir-ra, which most Assyriologists translate as “the place of the Tree (or Grove) of Life” – Count Goblet D’Alviella ( The Migration of Symbols , 1894) The Gospels are not a Biography ... it was not-and is still not-possible to ascertain when and how those early gospels came into being. Neither original manuscripts not early references to such manuscripts existed. Even approximate dating is uncertain - Holger Kersten ( The Original Jesus ) The Four Gospels do not make a good biography. Perhaps, their authors did not mean them to be a biography. In any case, the areas of disagreement on key events are numerous. These discrepancies have been covered in the works of many writers. If anything will convince people that Christ did not physically exist, or that the ancient Biblicists and modern clergy are in no way to be trusted on any subject, it will be the evidence proving the Gospels are forgeries. They are inexact and flagrant attempts to rescript the lost lore of the adepts that was destroyed by Christian megalomaniacs who are still considered paragons of spirituality. Matthew lists twenty-eight generations from David to Jesus, while Luke tabulates forty-three. According to John Jesus visited Jerusalem at least four times, but the"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Synoptics (Mark, Luke and Matthew) assure us that he journeyed to that city only once. As to the length of Jesus’ ministry the Synoptics say one year, but John says at least 3 years. From the Synoptical account, we gather that the savior carried out his work chiefly in Galilee. But John informs us that Judea was the principal theatre of the ministry of Christ - John G. Jackson ( Pagan Origins of the Jesus Myth ) One would think, given the evidence of incompetence, that if the Gospel's compilers, whoever they were, had wished to compose a biography of a living man, they would have done a much better job of getting their facts right. Even if one of them had provided some hardcore evidence for Jesus' existence, all would have been well. Men would have made up their minds about Jesus and Christianity rationally . They would not have had to rely on mere faith. But perhaps this was the reason why the Bible was written the way it was. Maybe human reason was not being appealed to after all and, although it may sound like an extreme thing to say, perhaps the Bible was written and compiled by the enemies of reason. Church experts admit to no evidence of the existence of the Gospels for at least a century after the time it is said Jesus Christ was born in a manger. The most ancient literature fails to show any trace of acquaintance with, nor the use of, the Gospels we know today. It is not possible to find in any writings compiled between the beginning of the First Century and the middle of the Second Century, any reference to Jesus Christ or the Gospels - Tony Bushby ( The Bible Fraud ) The mythical as opposed to the historical interpretation of the Gospels has been presented with some clarity by such men as Dupuis, Drews, Robertson, Smith, Renan, Strauss, Massey, Higgins, Mead and others. The historical view of Jesus’ life is stubbornly maintained in spite of the evidence adduced by Comparative Religion and Mythology, which points with steady directness to the fact that the events of the Gospel narrative are matched with surprising fidelity by the antecedent careers of such world saviors as Dionysus, Osiris, Sabazius, Tammuz, Adonis, Atys, Orpheus, Mithras, Zoroaster, Krishna, Bala-Rama, Vyasa, Buddha, Hercules, Sargon, Serapis, Horus, Marduk, Izdubar, Witoba, Apollonius of Tyana, Yehoshua ben Pandira, and even Plato and Pythagoras - Alvin Boyd Kuhn ( The Lost Light ) The Inner Zodiac ...perhaps there is a pattern set up in the heavens for one who desires to see it, and having seen it, to find one in himself - Plato A reading of the ancient Egyptian texts shows us that the adepts of old were quite aware of the intimate relationship between consciousness and matter, or what has been termed \"matter.\" Whereas modern man perceives only differences between consciousness and matter, the ancients saw the similarities between them. They knew both the zodiac and the gods of the heavens were put there, so to speak, by way of consciousness. They knew that by studying the stars they were studying human nature. They would not have wasted their time otherwise. They would not have constructed their temples to represent the human form had they not been aware of the relationships between microcosmic and macrocosmic phenomena. The ancients were astrologers for a reason. It was not because"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"they were superstition-ridden primitives, or idol-worshipping heathens, as we have been conditioned to believe. On the contrary, the ancient adepts can truly be regarded as early depth-psychologists or scientists. In their case, they simply understood that all things had a life essence and a meaning for being. They lacked the subjectivity that leads modern men to believe they are the supremely important life form on Earth. As scholar Alvin Boyd Kuhn so brilliantly pointed out: The sun in its movements through the signs was made the mirror of our life in spirit. To follow the yearly round of the zodiac was to epitomize graphically the whole history of human experience. Thus the inner meaning of our mortal life was endlessly repeated in the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly cycle of the sun's passage, the seven or twelve divisions of which marked the seven- or twelvefold segmentation of our spiritual history or our initiations For the ideology of the malignancy of matter to gradually take hold, and for man's antipathy toward the world, as well as to his own body, to deepen it was essential for traditions and teachings of the Arya to be utterly suppressed. No control was going to come to the tyrants of the world as long as their august schools and pristine ways remained intact. In particular, astrological science had to be misrepresented and egregiously transmogrified. Man was never to know that he is a living breathing zodiac. He was never to realize his own consciousness was the \"little sun\" within. He was never to comprehend that he was the hero undergoing the trials of Osiris, Horus, or Hercules. Men were never to realize that their consciousness, like the zodiac, had four cardinal hemispheres. The Four Evangelists Not only do the Gospel writers fail to offer appropriate evidence to substantiate their claims upon the grounds of reasonable probability, but their numerous discrepancies, contradictions, and omissions, their readiness to accept as facts rumors and legends which they had heard at third and fourth hand; their obvious role as reformers, their desire to promote these doctrines and their apparent willingness to even invent stories to promote these doctrines is proof that, instead of being objective historians, they were decidedly propagandists. Indeed, if any subject other than religion were involved, it is extremely doubtful whether any body of thoughtful men would take the writings of such men seriously - Ernest Busenbark ( Symbols, Sex and the Stars ) The evidence we provide here (and in our DVD presentation on Astro-Theology and Sidereal Mythology) should be enough to convince a rational and disingenuous person that the Biblicists undertook the task of rescripting stellar gnosis. Should further proof be required, however, we need only analyze the Four Gospels and the manner in which they cryptically refer to ancient Astro-Theological lore. Before we get to the individual books and their titles, let us first examine the symbols that have traditionally been assigned to each of the so-called \"Evangelists\" whose names allegedly appear on the four Gospel accounts. These symbols are patently astrological, but the mythmongers have not been consistent. They have altered the attributions of zootypes to the four Apostles. They are not correctly assigned."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The traditional assignment is as follows: MATTHEW - The Man MARK - The Lion LUKE - The Bull or Ox JOHN - The Eagle Symbols of the Four Evangelists; from a page in the Book of Kells. Clockwise the images are - the Man, the Lion, the Eagle, and the Bull, for Matthew, Mark, John, and Luke. The correct astrological assignment is: MATTHEW - The Eagle MARK - The Bull LUKE - The Lion JOHN - The Man This is because the name John , properly rendered as Jahn, or Jahan (from Ionnes, or Oannes), connotes the month of January which falls during the astrological period of Aquarius. The astrological symbol of Aquarius is the man with the urn or water pitcher. The character John the Baptist, for instance, has the name John because his fictive character represents the sign of Aquarius, although his symbolism is a Christian travesty of what should be. The lion has been assigned to Mark. It is the Atonist symbol of the city of Venice and the Vatican. The lion symbolizes the Tribe of Judea, and can be seen on numerous civic edifices and on the heraldic devices of many royal houses. (See The Irish Origins of Civilization , for more on this.) Astrologically, however, the lion properly belongs to Luke. Interestingly, we find the four archetypes in Egypt mythology. They appear as the four sons of Horus, whose names are:"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Imsety - (human-headed) Tuamutf - (or Duanmutef, jackal-headed) Kabhsenuf - (baboon-headed) Hapi - (falcon or hawk-headed) During the mummification process, the body's organs were removed and placed in four jars adorned with the heads of these four sons. The sons were the \"protectors\" of the various organs. The Book of Mark And just as the historical books of the Old Testament are not history, so the Gospels are not biography - Northrop Frye ( The Great Code The Bible and Literature ) This is the Book of Mars . Mark comes from Martian or Mars. As we have said, the disguises are rather thin, because the story was never meant to be too cryptic. It was the same as so many other stories that are common all over the planet and which are autonomous creations of the human being as he seeks to comprehend the enigmas of existence. Mars was a well-known planet and archetype. It is the ruler of the sign Aries. So the Book of Mark is, in zodiacal terms, the Book of Aries . And this makes perfect sense as Aries is the first house of the zodiac and is the place of rising of the sun at Easter or at the spring equinox. We even get terms like \"arise and shine,\" from the Aries house, as this is literally where the orb of day does arise and shine. The house of \"arising\" is Aries. Aries is in the month of April. April comes from the word Aperio , meaning “I open.” This is because April opens the year. Aries is the sign that is ruled by the Ram. In Christian art we see one of the 4 Evangelists symbolized by a Bull. This is also to do with Mark/Aries, because both Aries and Taurus are constellations or houses on the Eastern horizon. They are the eastern signs always seen in the sky together. And in ages past the symbols connected to both these signs were very pervasive and important. Christ is often depicted carrying a lamb and in nativity scenes a small lamb is often seen. The Book of Luke In Egyptian Sign-Language, the earliest language of Mythology, the Sun was represented, in the fullness of its power, by the Lion - Gerald Massey This is also transparent to those who have done their homework. Luke is Latin for Lucius and both words mean Light. The House of Light, of Lucius is Leo, the domicile or natal house of the sun. This is the Book of Leo . The sun rises to its astrological throne in the signs of Cancer and Leo in the Northern sky, during the months of July and August. In Druidic Ireland the name Leo was Lugh, the great solar hero. To the Welsh he was Llew, to the Romans Lugus, and to the Sumerians he was Lughal. Clearly, the hero represents the astrological archetype of Leo. In the Christian iconography we have one of the Evangelists represented by a Lion. In the Nativity scenes we see four animals around the cradle of Jesus. One of these is also a lion. Christians probably believe that there was one in the area and just happened to wander into the inn to take a peek at sleeping Jesus. Good thing it"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"wasn’t very hungry. Furthermore, Jesus is often termed the \"Lion of Judea.\" Book of Matthew This is more adroitly concealed. But those who are aware of the theocracy of Egypt can recognize the word Matt . It derives from Maat, the Egyptian goddess of justice, balance and harmony. Maat is pronounced Mayat . She is the Mahat of the Brahmins, the Tiamat of the Skalds, the Maia of the Romans, and the Mara of the pagans. Maat is always symbolized by the Scales of Justice, which, in turn relate with the western sign of Libra. So this is the Book of Libra . Now in the Bible we read that Matthew was the disciple that the other 11 spurned. This was because Matthew was a tax collector. However behind all the hyperbole we have a secret concealed. The symbol of the tax collectors has always been the scales or balances. This is because along with currency they accepted grain and livestock. Their assistants would carry large scales around from village to village. One can see the same practice today in rural communities of eastern lands. Astrologically, Maat and her scales are connected with the western sign of Libra, which directly faces the signs of Aries and Taurus. Additionally, Libra was the last sign to be officially added to the codified zodiac, although it was known ages ago. This is why we hear that Matthew was the last to join the twelve disciples. Matthew is symbolized by an eagle. One of the most important constellations in the western sky (near to the sign of Scorpio), is Aquila the “Eagle.” Libra was a sign made out of part of Scorpio. The word Matthew, also comes from Matt-Theos . The Book of John This is abstract until we understand that John comes from Jahan or Jahn , which comes from the earlier Ionnes , Oannes (the fish god). Jahan or Jahn give us other names, such as Jane, Joan, and Janus. It gives us the word January. January is the month that corresponds with the sign of Aquarius. Aquarius is a southern sign symbolized by a man carrying a pitcher from which water flows. This is why we have the biblical character John the Baptist, the initiator of Jesus. The sign of Aquarius became associated with baptism, cleansing, and purification by water. This idea was adopted by Jews and Christians.
