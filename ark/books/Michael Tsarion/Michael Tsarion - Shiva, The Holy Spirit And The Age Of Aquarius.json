[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":" Listen to Michael Tsarion's ground- breaking interview on \"The Freeman Perspective\" 2021, Shiva, the Holy Spirit & Age of Aquarius ◊ ◊ ◊ Introduction ...the final goal of world revolution is not Socialism or even Communism, it is not a change in the existing economic system, it is not the destruction of civilization in a material sense; the revolution desired by the leaders is a moral and spiritual revolution, an anarchy of ideas by which all standards set up throughout nineteen centuries shall be reversed - Nesta Webster ( Secret Societies and Subversive Movements, 1921) Benjamin Disraeli, the first Jewish Prime Minister of Victorian Britain, wrote in his novel Coningsby : \"The world is run by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.\" Disraeli was aware that the world is controlled by powerful secret societies and fraternal orders whose agendas and goals have little to do with the best interests of humankind. Although these orders do not necessarily conceal their identities, they do endeavor to conceal whatever goes on behind the doors of their various lodges and establishments. Exclusive occult orders do not wish their strange practices, rites, and agendas to be openly disclosed and they excel in the manufacture of many a guileful strategy and device designed to ensure secrecy. As one Freemasonic member and author reveals: Freemasonry is labyrinthine. It is full of puzzles, conundrums, misspellings, corruptions, cryptic clues, and simple salutes, childish codes, contrivances, circular paths, roads that sometimes lead nowhere, walls appearing to be ten feet thick yet giving way easily to the lightest touch in the right spot, riddles to be solved, numerous passwords, an allegorical, highly symbolical, double-entendre storyline worthy of the best latter-day spy writers, protected by secret signs and symbols and a myriad of enigmas to be confronted...In the labyrinth that is Freemasonry there is a center where rests its holy grail. Many have tried to find it only to reach dead ends - Leon Davin ( The Ritual: The Greatest Story Never Told ) In our new book The Irish Origins of Civilization, we expose the true origins and agendas of the world’s most powerful secret societies. We also expose the origins and agendas of the religions that the elites of ancient secret societies have given birth to. We endeavor to demonstrate how this proverbial \"hidden hand\" has expertly used both religion and politics to further their nefarious anti-human objectives. Essentially, our work informs the reader of certain vital occult facts that are, for the most part, unknown to members of the secret societies. The true origins and agendas of the Masonic Order, Knights Templars, Rosicrucians, and Illuminati, etc, have been carefully guarded secrets. As leading Masons have explained in their own works: The Blue Degrees are but the outer court...of the temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretation. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them...The true explanation is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry (those of the 32nd and 33rd degrees) - Albert Pike (Grand Master of American Scottish Rite Freemasonry and Head of the Illuminati) These good folk swell our numbers and fill our money-box. Set yourselves to work; these gentlemen must be made to nibble at the bait...But this sort of people must always be made to believe that the grade they have reached is the last - Adam Weishaupt (Founder of the Illuminati, 1776)"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Disraeli was not the only person to remark upon the hidden elites who work invisibly to change the course of humanity's fate. In her rambling and voluminous writings, the occultist and eminent Fabian Alice A. Bailey laid out the facts thusly: Behind the division of humanity stand those Enlightened Ones whose right and privilege it is to watch over human evolution and to guide the destinies of men...This they do through the implanting of ideas in the minds of the world thinkers, so that these ideas in due time receive recognition and eventually become controlling factors in human life. They train the members of the New Group of World Servers in the task of changing these ideas into ideals. These in turn become the desired objectives of the thinkers and are then taught to the powerful middle class and worked up into world forms of governments or religion, thus forming the basis of the new world order Naturally, the power-elites and their minions, who apparently believe the world to be their personal play-pen, have a great deal to lose should the “Under-Classes,” that is, the ordinary men and women of the world - learn about the subtle nature of the psychic and social control that operates all around them and that is hidden in plain sight. However, the task of revealers is made considerably more difficult due to \"consensus trance\" and the knee-jerk fear that automatically freezes a mutilated and conditioned human mind. The Servants of Truth know from experience how few friends are won when and if they should endeavor to expose the dirty little secrets of religion’s upper echelon. Nevertheless, a Servant of Truth is not permanently daunted by the discomfort caused by the presence and proximity of truth. The Servant of Truth is aware that one is much more likely to get a cut from a blunt knife than from a sharp one. And he is aware that the cost of ignorance is ultimately far greater than the price paid for knowledge. The Servant of Truth knows that freedom is never free and that silence is most definitely consent. He comes to realize that on the great board game of life if he fatally chooses to not occupy the white squares of knowledge he will be manipulated by those who will. The only good is knowledge and the only evil ignorance - Socrates The task of exposing the secrets of secret societies is somewhat complicated since it also inevitably involves the exposure of the secrets of religion. And since religion is intimately connected to politics, the task cannot but include an exposure of the secrets of politics. Although it is vain to expect a single book to investigate all the dark highways and byways of these institutions, we can at least make a zealous start, and wait to see where the river of ink leads. Along the way, we bear in mind that it is not one torch we must light, and not a single shadowy labyrinth we must explore, but three . Like a newly initiated Masonic neophyte we too must negotiate three steps toward truth and empowerment. May our destination be the same as that purported by Masonry. May our three lonely roads lead us to the one altar, one shrine - that of Truth. Truly, it is not hyperbole to say that we are, during the years of this New Millennium, going to experience the greatest of revelations concerning the most relevant of human mysteries. We can expect many a layer of deception to be peeled away and jettisoned. Some of us may be glad and grateful for the coming of the light of revelation. Others among us may be startled by the proximity of such knowledge and many will be deeply threatened by its presence. Many will not wish to see in themselves the dirt that this light will surely reveal. For these types there are always churches and priests. There will always be those confessors in black to hide behind. There will be those who will seek, with their hymns, confessionals, and incense, to appease the profound inner angst of men fast approaching the end of their present cycle of existence.

The Origins of Evil ♦ It took man over a million years to progress from using stones as he found them to the realization that they could be chipped and flaked to better purpose. It then took another 500,000 years before Neanderthal man mastered the concept of stone tools, and a further 50,000 years before crops were cultivated and metallurgy was discovered. Hence, by all scales of evolutionary reckoning, we should still be as far removed from any basic understanding of mathematics, engineering or science - But here we are, only 7,000 years later, landing probes on Mars...So, how did we inherit wisdom, and from whom? - Laurence Gardner In the book Atlantis, Alien Visitation and Genetic Manipulation, we revealed the manner in which evil came into the world and into the consciousness of human beings. In that book we show how, approximately 50,000 years ago, our solar system was visited by alien beings, possibly from the star system Alpha Draconis."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" These beings, whose bloodline descendants control today’s world governments and religions, were being pursued across the galaxy by rival factions from their own planet or planets, and did not come here by choice. The presence of these visitors was known by many cultures that have preserved, in myth and legend, their story and their various names. In his book, Past Shock , author Jack Barranger asserts that there are still, after all the purges, over 30,000 texts containing information pertaining to the presence of alien beings on our planet. In our book, and in other writing on this subject, we revealed how many modern scientists and physicists, such as Carl Sagan, Robert Oppenheimer, Herman Oberth, Frances Crick, Einstein, Tesla, and Fredrick Soddy, etc, were more than open to the idea of alien interference with earth history. We explained how the willful destruction of the great ocean planet Tiamat precipitated earth’s recent great deluge. And we revealed how these alien visitors, from distant reaches, came down to our planet, erected their main headquarters on the now lost continent of Appalachia, to erect the famed city-complex later known as Atlantis. The alien empire of Atlantis stretched its tentacles to all the corners of the earth. The first draconian “World Order” that we have experienced, was Atlantean. We revealed that, from their base at Atlantis, the alien visitors initiated a genetic hybridization program that lasted centuries. In their nefarious experiments the Atlanteans crossed their own alien DNA with that of our human ancestors. This event radically altered the course of earth history and had very adverse affects on human consciousness. The genetically “schizoid” being they created, we refer to as “Homo Atlantis.” His descendents still live today. Prior to their genetic interference, the visitors had attempted sexual congress with earth females, but as the ancient records reveal, this proved unsuccessful. And the daughters of Cain with whom the angels had companied conceived, but they were unable to bring forth their children, and they died. And of the children who were in their wombs some died, and some came forth, having split open the bellies of their mothers they came forth by their navels - (The Ethiopian Kebra Nagast ) Those Daughters of Darkness became pregnant...As a result of the beauty of the forms of the emissary, whom they had seen they had abortions, and the fruits of their body fell upon earth and consumed the blossoms of the trees - ( Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium - a Gnostic Text) The genetic hybridization experiments of the Fallen Angels (the Nephilim or Annunaki) was recorded in ancient suppressed and sequestered books such as the Book of Enoch: And then Samjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin - Book of Enoch And even from the Bible’s convoluted scripture we are informed of the creation of man, and of the existence of two Adams, one of the Earth (natural) and one of the Heavens (engineered). And God said: Let us make man in our image, after our likeness - (Genesis 1:26) The first man Adam became a living being, the last Adam a life-giving spirit. The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven - (1 Corinthians 15:45) Man in made out of the dust of the ground. it is only after eating from the forbidden fruit that god said: \"Behold, the man is become as one of us.\" - John G. Jackson ( Pagan Origins of the Bible ) “Homo Atlantis” was created to be a servant in the Garden of Eden. The word eden comes from a word meaning “enclosed area.” It was in the closed area of Atlantis, in the precincts set aside for experimentation, that our remarkable genetic ancestor was fashioned. The race of Homo Atlantis was sent forth to garden, husband, mine, and generally labor at the behest of their alien masters. After the creation of Homo Atlantis every other humanoid (hominid) race was annihilated by our new masters, the “gods.” We have been led to believe that the entity that the Old Testament describes as a mass murderer and heinous leader is the God of the Universe. We have been led to think that the slaughter of human beings in the name of God is a divine act... In one of the most tragic ironies, the majority of humans continue to worship those “gods” who abused them the most - Jack Barranger ( Past Shock ) As a close reading of the ancient legends, scriptures and apocryphal works reveals, the race of Homo Atlantis, after some time in relative servitude, decided that they did not want to continue supporting the imbalanced status quo on Atlantis. These beings of strange birth certainly"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"had the high scientific intelligence of their alien masters, but they also possessed a different kind of wisdom wholly unknown and quite incomprehensible to their alien masters from distant stars. Homo Atlantis had soul. They had the so-called “Violet Ray.” They had an umbilical connection to the Earth-Mother and direct access to the Universal Intelligence. They operated from the Whole Mind and knew themselves to be unique under the stars. And so, after an undisclosed sojourn, Homo Atlantis decided to vacate the gardens of Atlantis and, after their subsequent exodus, they founded their own advanced civilization upon the continent of Oceana. There, where the Pacific is today, they founded the civilization of Lemuria. From that time onwards the Lemurians and their bloodline descendents have been the moral and spiritual rivals to the corrupt and perfidious Atlanteans. The manifold twists and turns of history cannot be thoroughly understood unless we are first made privy to this original racial schism. In your limbs lie nations twain, Rival races from their birth; One the mastery shall gain, The younger o’er the elder reign - Old Testament (on “Jacob” and “Esau”) After the unforeseen departure of the Lemurians, the Atlantean warlocks were forced to return to their drawing boards, so to speak, to create another slave race. The result of their second generation experiments can be referred to as “Adamic” Man. The Adams and Eves were the perfect slaves. They were sent forth “naked.” This simply means that they were mentally and somatically dumbed-down. Their cognitive centers of higher intelligence were purposely suppressed. And the Lord said, Look, the people are united, and they all have one language...Come on, let us go down, and therefore confound their language so that they cannot understand one another’s speech - (Genesis 11) Let us make him who shall nourish and sustain us. What shall we do to be invoked, to be remembered in earth? We have tried with our first creatures, but we could not make them venerate us. So then, let us try to make obedient, respectful beings, who shall nourish and sustain us - (The Maya Popul Vuh ) The Lemurians, who were suspiciously keeping watch over their former masters, discovered that their nefarious fathers had again created a subordinate race to serve them. They realized too that “Adamic” Man was, to all intents and purposes, their genetic cousin and, therefore, could not be left in servitude. The Lemurians decided to send agents into Atlantis to make contact with the oppressed and ignorant Adams and Eves. This was achieved and the counsel of the Lemurians led to a second vacation of Atlantean slaves. The majority of the Adams and Eves left for Lemuria with their advanced genetic cousins. Once again the Atlanteans were deprived of their perfect servant race. Because of the intervention of their “First-Born” (the Lemurians), the Atlanteans grew wrathful in the extreme and unleashed what the legends describe as an all-out atomic war against the Lemurians and the Adamic Race. This worldwide conflict occurred, we believe, approximately 13,500 years ago and was so fierce that it precipitated a shift of Earth’s polar axis and a myriad other natural tribulations. The shift of the earth’s axis resulted in the near destruction of all the planet’s flora and fauna. Its toll on life, human and animal, was unimaginable. Our planet is still in slow recovery from this cataclysmic event. In our own “Race Memory” we still contain the engrams (encoded imprints) of this period. We all contain deep ancestral memories of the destruction of continents, civilizations, and of all the subsequent phenomena that resulted from this monumental upheaval. We also contain within us the memory of previous times when life was harmonious and pleasant and in which there was no evil, slavery, or disease. The Roman writer Ovid stated that during the reign of the legendary king Kronos...springtime was perennial. Virtually every commentator of antiquity on this topic agreed that this lost age was a golden one and the Earth a veritable paradise - Allan and Delair ( Cataclysm ) After the shifting of the polar axis, and the formation of a new equator, the few bedraggled disoriented survivors moved to find new homes. The Atlanteans chose to converge at the equatorial region, in the area known today as Asia Minor. This was, apparently, one of the few areas that would sustain life all year round. Consequently, it is from this general region that the blood-thirsty, tyrannical, post-diluvian empires arose, and from which our “official” histories begin. The peculiar and suggestive cover of Time Magazine during the \"Countdown to War\" in the Gulf. These perfidious empires were the pattern upon which most modern states are based. The Lemurians, and the remainder of their Adamic wards, chose to disperse to the distant corners of the planet and to settle on any lands that they might find habitable. It is partly because of this decision that we find so many similar languages, customs, rites and idioms throughout the world. As a result of the prolonged and intense genetic experimentation, all living humans contain within their biology human and alien DNA. Moreover, it was this transgenic experimentation that caused what we know as evil to come into the world and into our consciousness. Evil does not come into being due to the flawed mechanics of nature. Nature is in perfect harmony from the largest neutron star to the smallest quantum particle. Nature would, therefore, not be likely to so blunder as to create a proclivity in her highest species so lethal as to undermine her own sublime order. The human beings who believe this fiction are laboring under one of the greatest of all fallacies, and will inherit perdition as a result of this chronic misapprehension. No, evil does not come into the world because of any organic failure in nature’s laws, but from constant tinkering with, and violation of, nature’s inviolate ordinances."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Each person takes birth inheriting the legacy of the past. As Omar Khayaam reminded us, each person contains within them both heaven and hell. We are each both a devil and a saint. We are each capable of scintillating creative mastery and moral purity and we are also each capable of perpetrating acts of unimaginable criminality and injustice. We are violent to ourselves and to others around us. Moreover, we are the only species to take pleasure from our violence, sadism and perversity. Eve’s descendants have steadily accumulated the power to destroy each other in an unholy Armageddon and, like sleepwalkers, are shuffling toward a planetary ecological disaster. How could a slight, five-foot-tall, two-legged animal create such sublimity and yet wreak so much havoc in so miniscule an interval of earth’s history? - Leonard Schlain ( Sex, Time and Power ) ...man differs from the animal by the fact that he is a killer; he the only primate that kills and tortures members of his own species without any reason, either biological or economic, and who feels satisfaction in doing so. It is this biologically non- adaptive and non-phylogenetically programmed “malignant” aggression that constitutes the real problem and the danger to man’s existence as a species...The most ample – and horrifying – documentation for seemingly spontaneous forms of destructiveness are on the record of civilized history. The history of war is a report of ruthless and indiscriminate killing and torture, whose victims were men, women, and children. Many of these occurrences give the impression of orgies of destruction, in which neither conventional nor genuinely moral factors had any inhibitory effect...There is hardly a destructive act human imagination could think of that has not been acted out again and again - Erich Fromm ( Anatomy of Human Destructiveness ) The major rise in our killing prowess occurred primarily in the last hundred thousand years, with the sharpest spike limited to the last forty thousand. Creation is a nightmare spectacular taking place on a planet that has been soaked for hundreds of millions of years in the blood of all its creatures. The soberest conclusion we can make is that the planet is being turned into a vast pit of fertilizer - Leonard Schlain ( Sex, Time and Power ) If the development of civilization has such a far-reaching similarity to the development of the individual and if it employs the same methods, may we not be justified in reaching the diagnosis that, under the influence of cultural urges, some civilizations...possibly the whole of mankind, have become neurotic? - Sigmund Freud It is sad that the question of our capacity for injustice, crime, perversity, and evil is not constantly on the mind of every single human being. It is the central question of our lives, and the time has come to have it answered. We must know why it is that we are condemned to live the kind of disempowered, confused and mediocre lives we live and why it is that our world is plagued with corruption. We must know why it is that in a mere 200 years over 160 million people have suffered violent deaths at the hands of other human beings and why 50,000 species of plant and animal life are destroyed forever per one single year. It is our right to know why we experience inner psychic and moral commotion, and why we often experience constant mental and emotional turmoil. The reasons for social and existential conflict were known to our ancestors who were themselves inheritors of the “bad genes.” The time has come to heed their counsel and wisdom. Behind the poesy lies the profoundest wisdom. Zeus gathered the gods in council to express his concern that these unusual creatures would one day challenge their hegemony. He was loathe to exterminate them with his thunderbolts, though, because there would be no one to bring the gods offerings. He solved the problem by putting each creature into a trance and then splitting it down the middle...Upon awakening, each half only dimly remembered what it had been prior to being cleft in two. Zeus explained to the assembled gods and goddesses the cleverness of his scheme. These creatures would no longer pose a threat to the gods, because they would dissipate their considerable energy by spending the rest of their days searching for their missing halves - Leonard Schlain (recounting Plato’s Symposium account) He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way...They grope in the dark without light, and him maketh to stagger like a drunken man - (Job 12:24-25) In order to prevent discovery of these facts, the post-diluvian masters of the world, the descendents of the Atlanteans, have chosen to manufacture unsustainable “Ice-Age” fallacies to prevent us looking back to discover the existence of the great cultures of past ages. They have suppressed great scholars who refuted their lies, and have imposed a vile educational system that indoctrinates us from the earliest age thereby preventing most of us from looking at the world or at anything else with clarity or discernment. We are drugged by poisoned foodstuffs, and by the pharmaceuticals and substances we turn to in order to turn-off the inner angst. It is not just outsiders who cannot be heard, it is dissenting members of the scientific professions themselves...It is worrying to learn that in countries like Great Britain and the United States, thought to be among the most civilized on Earth, some professional scientists can feel so isolated and ignored that they have to take their case directly to the public via the popular press. Equally, it is depressing to discover that in countries which pride themselves on their intellectual tolerance, it is impossible to voice scientific dissent without attracting this kind of response from those who perceive to be the guardians of orthodoxy - Richard Milton ( Shattering the Myths of Darwinism ) The truth concerning the themes that we deal with (of alien visitation, the origins of evil and of secret societies, etc), could not be wholly or lucidly revealed to humankind during the past centuries for the simple reason that the time was not right. Specifically, the astrological time was not right. In the present millennia, however, the time is right and as a result many secrets are about to be revealed to the human race. These revelations will cause man to radically alter the way he sees himself and the world. They will alter man's perception of history. In fact, the new revelations are likely to cause changes in human understanding more radical than those which occurred due to the findings of Darwin, Freud, or Marx. Many human beings will not enjoy experiencing an alteration in worldview. They will not accept the recent findings of experts and top scholars such as Allan and Delair, Michael Cremo, Otto Binder, Max Flint, and Richard Milton, etc, whose researches and discoveries confirm that there were highly advanced civilizations on this planet long before 11,000 years ago and that man's true origins are"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"not those commonly reckoned. Most controversial is the evolutionary question. I have done a great deal of work on Darwin and can say with some assurance that Darwin did not derive his theory from nature but rather superimposed a certain philosophical world-view on nature and then spent 20 years trying to gather the facts to make it stick - Immanuel Velikovsky ...molybdenum, a very rare metal plays an important role as a trace element in the physiology of all Earth creatures. It is surprising, therefore, that life so dependant on a rare metal should arise on a molybdenum-poor world like ours - Otto Binder and Max Flint ( Mankind - Child of the Stars ) Whether we are ready for it or not we are each going to discover the truth about our own strange origins and destiny. It is a given that no one person’s reaction to these revelations will be the same as another's, yet the reactions of the majority of the world’s masses will fashion the kind of future we all get to experience. The multitude, lost in their will no doubt continue existing as \"amnesiacs\" and “smiling depressives.” Their narcissism will not abate until the world familiar to them finally passes away. The unconscious masses will continue with the dance macabre and and will continue to perform the roles scripted for them by depraved social engineers. The world we are bequeathing to future generations will make the nightmares of Marquis de Sade and Franz Kafka seem paltry by comparison. ...the whole force of urban-industrialism upon our tastes is to convince us that artificiality is not only inevitable, but better - Theodore Roszak Mankind’s “self-alienation\" has reached such a degree that it can experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order - Jerry Mander The Rebel, the Cause & the Age of Revealing ♦ During times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act - George Orwell Fortunately the celestial clock is with us and with the Spirit of Revelation . Alfred Lord Tennyson’s “wild bells” are already beginning to ring out the old, the vile, and the degenerate. In this age of “Solution-Think” we will be given the chance to dispel the ideological lies and fallacies that have mentally and spiritually duped us. As the Maya prophecies inform us, we have been, since the year 1999, in the so-called “Age of Revealing.” This is a time of literal “Apocalypse” when the masks of the false begin to come down. This period of catabolic action, and collective catharsis, will be deeply threatening to those morally unhygienic souls who have long profited from the ruin of their fellows, and to those consummate narcissists who have advanced at the expense of the good people around them. The approaching endgame is especially threatening to those connoisseurs of power whose insatiable penchant for destruction and deception has contaminated the world. In the second half of our book on Atlantis, we cover the various machinations of the Atlanteans and their progeny down through history. We concentrated on the Renaissance, the Tudor Dynasty and on the present Silicon Age. It is the goal of the Irish Origins of Civilization to provide the reader with an equally interesting and revealing conspiracy against truth that has been in operation since the aftermath of the universal upheaval that brought about the wholesale destruction of Atlantis, Lemuria and the other great continents of pre-history. Our story involves Egypt, but also Ireland, for it was on the Emerald Isle that many of the survivors of the Polar Shift, and subsequent cataclysms, found haven. The majority of scholars believe that civilization arose in Asia Minor, in the Levant, and in Egypt (Africa). However, nothing could be further from the truth. Throughout the following centuries the Irish, or Arish (meaning noble, pure, illumined) traveled from their haven to the four corners of the earth bringing their high Lemurian (and Atlantean) culture with them. This single fact, that civilization spread from West to East has, for reasons that should now be obvious, been carefully guarded by the power-brokers on Vatican Hill and in Jerusalem. Revealing the Irish origins of civilization will involve exposure of the multifarious ways in which humankind's history has been distorted and manipulated. Our revelations will therefore be controversial and challenging to those who have no appetite for truth. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth becomes the greatest enemy of the State - Dr. Joseph M. Goebbels (Nazi Minister of Propaganda) We certainly acknowledge the wisdom in George Orwell's warning of how telling the truth can often be an act of rebellion. Indeed, our work is meant to be controversial and revisionist. It is meant to be a testament to and for"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Freedom . It is composed in the Spirit of Rebellion - rebellion against ancient tyranny. Its contents are controversial, seditious, iconoclastic and even treasonous. It is, however, more than a play on words to declare that there is no such thing as treason against the treasonous! Need it be stressed that there is no such thing as freedom in a “Bastille of Lies,” the dark shadow of which overlooks a landscape of existential misery and moral pestilence? The purpose of my work is to counter the Orwellian boot that has been stamping upon the face of all humanity for millennia. It is our intention to counter this violence with a form of intellectual violence of our own. We intend to kick down the doors to the corrupt citadels of oppression and deceit and let the true light in. We intend to sweep away the cobwebs that enshroud the mind and remove the thorns of delusion that enswathe the human heart. What may come after our efforts is not a primary concern. We are not interested in building new world systems, but confine our energies and intention to the destruction of old ones that must be rivaled and logically toppled at this time. Therefore, we do not distract ourselves from envisioning the splendor or fragrance of the rare and precious flowers that will take root to grow in tomorrow’s exquisite gardens of freedom. The toil of uprooting weeds consumes our every waking moment. We find our purpose and reward in this deconstruction and revision and do not see, feel, or lament the blood that falls from our hands that tear the weeds of evil from the ground of humanity. Indeed, though the sky may for a while be blackened with the smoke of our weed-fires we find a certain rare fragrance in such effusion. Though it may not be the aroma of roses the perfume from the burning pyres of evil and ignorance is not wholly intolerable, and is not without its own aesthetic quality. From the embers of such pyres we can even be afforded a clairvoyant intimation of the future world to arise. It is the world that once was long ago, which existed once-upon-a-time - pure, effulgent, realized and magnificent - one not of devils, demons, gods, kings, saints, or sinners, but of men, free inwardly and outwardly, able and willing to holistically and reverently explore the mystery of themselves and of the planet that has housed them throughout the troubled ages and that has long preserved the secret of their salvation. Come to the center of the earth, and there you shall find the Philosopher's Stone - Basilius Valentinus (Fifteenth Century Alchemist) The enemy that we face, which has haunted our world for millennia, will not concede of its own will. It will not yield or even give ground. It is in fear but has combined its fear with occult knowledge and this combination makes it lethal in the extreme. It seeks to humiliate the good, the pure, and the virtuous. It is the enemy of truth and of freedom. It cannot triumph since the force it vainly opposes is eternal and self- sustaining. The problem of evil is, however, not solved with a clenched fist but with an open, receptive, and mutable mind. These characteristics are represented by the Archangel Michael and his mighty sword, by Arthur’s Excalibur , by Robin’s flaming arrows, and by Merlin’s serpentine wand. We overcome the direst enemies with knowledge not might. We seek revelation to prevent revolution, to overcome evil with the force of our example not by the example of our force but by psychological weaponry and by total conviction in our cause and sovereign power. As said above, we understand lucidly that freedom is never free and that silence is most definitely consent. Whether we are joined by others or not we proceed on our quest with conviction and vehemence. There is the fairest of damsels to be saved and a Serpent’s blood to redden our shields - that is all! The Irish Origins of Civilization constitutes more than a brave attempt to unravel and explain some of the most convoluted and complex secrets of the Christian religion. Our aim is to assert the fact that there is little real authenticity to the story of Jesus Christ, as related to us in the Bible. We are not saying, however, that there have not been enlightened god-realized men and women in the world. Nor are we saying that Jesus - the Man - did not exist. Authors such as Mustapha Gadalla, Laurence Gardner, Ahmed Osman, Ralph Ellis, and Tony Bushby, have demonstrated that the being we know as Jesus did exist as a man, and did indeed walk abroad in the world of the past. Their work, however, strongly refutes the accounts given of his existence and life in the Bible’s New Testament. The discoveries of these authors are exceptionally revealing and informing, and so critical to the work of other revisionists, that it is unlikely that this present work could have come into being without their findings. Between our polemical work and that of the authors mentioned there are, however, several points of contention that we feel the reader needs to be aware of. For though we salute their erudition and passion, we are not necessarily in accord with all of their sundry conclusions. Nevertheless, we do not intend to present our esoteric theories concerning the Irish origins of civilization , Jesus and the rise of Christianity, the advent of secret societies, or the fate of humankind, etc, without first briefly delineating the essential points made by these exemplary researchers. Each author has labored to untie the tight knots of confusion from around the ark of the mysteries, and we are indebted to them for such commitment. But, dare we say it, for all the adroit study and erudition of these authors, it appears that the final “Holy Grail” so to speak, remains elusive. The bullets have indeed been fired, but will they strike the correct targets? In short, whatever truth and wisdom is to be found in the bible (and there is plenty), it obviously was, and is still, the preferred operating manual of sadistic arch-hierarchs, those perpetrators of the worst type of mind and soul control imaginable. Those who resist this fact can look to the bible itself for confirmation. Among my people are wicked men who lie in wait like men who snare birds and like those who set traps to catch men. Like cages full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; they have become rich and powerful and have grown fat and sleek. Their evil deeds have no limit; they do not plead the case of the fatherless to win it, they do not defend the rights of the poor - (Jeremiah 5:26) Woe to you who call evil good and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter - (Isaiah 5:20)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"We repeat - the value from exposing the corruption and intrigue of the cruel inhuman leviathans of religion and politics cannot be understated or under-estimated. However, given today's apathy we might question what actual good will ultimately be derived from our efforts. Tragically, it appears that the human race has managed to arrive at a place where it is so jaded and sense-infatuated that it really could not care anymore whether Jesus ever existed or not. We can go so far as to say that it is not Jesus himself and his history or authenticity that interests most church-going Christians; it is what Jesus as a healing icon can do for them emotionally and physically that matters most. The average \"believer\" is not truly concerned with God’s nature, or with God’s mysteries. He is merely concerned with what God can do for him, and how God might make his sad, mediocre life less insipid. The average believer is not concerned about the emotions his Christ may have felt when he was betrayed with a kiss by a man he was ready to give his own life and even soul for. No, the average believer wants Jesus to do something for him. He wants Jesus to act on his behalf and to provide various physical, emotional, and spiritual comforts and securities. Yes, what a great pleasure a mentally and emotionally destitute (“meek”) man finds knowing that for the nominal fee of blind obedience his jealous god will fulfill his needs and also dispense hell and damnation to his enemies. Who could pass up such a platinum deal? The day that Jesus and god fail to cut it then the guru gimmick-merchant on the block will do just as well. Christian moralists may reflect upon the manner in which their own grandiloquent religious espousals have fostered the same pernicious disaffection in society that they vehemently attribute to atheism and materialism. Show me a force which binds today's humanity together with half the power it possessed in those centuries...And don't try to browbeat me with your prosperity, your riches, the rarity of famine and the speed of communications! The riches are greater but the force is less; there is no more a binding principle; everything has grown soft, everything and everyone grown flabby! - Fyodor Dostoevsky ( The Idiot ) Yes, religion is the little more than a narcissist’s Materialism. The singer and songwriter John Lennon once predicted that his band - the Beatles - would become \"more \"famous\" than Jesus.\" Wilhelm Reich. One of History's greatest geniuses. Died under suspicious circumstances while serving time in Federal Stockade after the FDA prohibited his pioneering therapeutic researches and techniques. A colleague of Freud, and rival to Einstein, he was the first man to have his books burned in the US. The trial judge refused to read any of his astounding and revolutionary works. Given that his iconoclastic forecast included other candidates within the entertainment business, as well as his own band, his strange prediction has actually turned out to have been quite accurate. Though we may resist accepting it, the youth could care less about Jesus and God. The young ones who appear to care, are forced to do so due to the inevitable indoctrination process of punitive parents and guardians. Left to their own devices, they prefer to choose Marilyn Manson and Snoop Doggy Dog as mentors, models, and way-showers. And perhaps they could care less about the Sacred Heart for good reason. After all, what does it really matter if a special man of god did walk the earth thousands of years ago? What does it matter that he had enemies, and that he sacrificed his life for what he believed? What does it matter that he had betrayers on his trail? What does it matter if he had magical powers to heal and reveal, or that he rose into heaven after his torture and death? Actually, to a rational mind, none of this matters at all. It works excellently as great tale, a ripping yarn, a Hollywood super-drama, and that is about all. Only the emotionally disturbed, psychologically infirm, or intentionally malign, have taken it to mean more than this. We do not need to recount the repulsive biographies or histories of so-called saints, kings, popes and evangelists, or recount the splendidly erudite theories of Freud, Jung, Reich and other psychoanalysts to reinforce this truism. No, few care, or have ever cared, about the factuality of bible stories. Inwardly, subconsciously, most people know the improbability of such stories. But since our ego-drives have taken root in such fictions, better that they remain and continue to be watered. Truth can perish, and the world can come to ruin, but as long as the ego and the persona, and the illusion of salvation at the hands of others remains constant, we believe.

Take away both, or either, and its power is gone - M. F. Cusack ( The Black Pope: A History of the Jesuits ) A religion which sedulously opposes its own improvement can do nothing essential toward improving anything else...On the contrary, it must check the growth of everything it touches with its palsied hands - Kersey Graves ( The Bible of Bibles ) The story of Jesus the God or of Jesus the Man is interesting to less and less rational people in the world today and there is nothing amiss with that. It is a good sign. The story of truth, of god, and of the divine in us, should not be fixed in the special past but in the special present - in the moment that is. Moreover, when we do our historical homework we find out that the story of Jesus is no more dramatic and miraculous, no more pathetic and majestic than the story of other masters of knowledge and Servants of Truth. Who dares declare that the story of Jesus Christ is any more captivating or inspiring than that of Imhotep, Apollonius of Tyana, Siddhartha, Milerepa, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharishi, Sarmad, or of Jiddu Krishnamurti? And, dare we ask how many people in today’s manic world care a jot for these bright lights of past times? For every Christ and Muhammad there are a thousand other god-men, born of virgins, imbued with the deepest wisdom and enamored with a divine mission. India is filled with like men and women today. So let it be known that there is nothing truly unique about the life of Jesus Christ. The only thing that is unique about the Christ is the lengths to which the Cult, working in his name, has gone to suppress the truth and to foist their unsustainable sectarian beliefs upon the world. The Christian zeal for brutal oppression and its violent conversion of non-believers, its penchant for false promises, its expertise with deception and its ability to spawn the vilest of human-monsters are what make it unique in the world. Therefore, unlike Gadalla, Bushby and other writers of their persuasion, we find our personal interests and passions to not be fulfilled by simple refutation and revision. We are not content to merely point out the manifold fallacies of the Bible and to expose the lack of historicity behind most of the key events therein. Nor are we content to merely uncover evidence for a mortal Jesus to replace the immortal one. We are not content to merely discover the tomb of a dead prophet-king who cheated crucifixion, or who never raised the dead, or performed miracles upon the banks of the Dead Sea, who had wife and offspring and who lived happily ever after. No, these are not our motivations. In light of the splendor and challenge of our metatheme such biographies prove too prosaic to overly preoccupy us. Our endeavor and motivation is a great deal more heretical and seditious. Yet, suggestively, it is the same motivation of great masters and enlighteners of the past, whose lives, words, and deeds sparked hot with rebellion and iconoclasm. Our agenda is, like theirs, to introduce the reader to the God and the Christ within the Self. There is no more sacred motivation and none which more threatens the ego and its external representatives. Our mission is to assist in the removal of the insinuated theological viruses which infect the minds and hearts of men, and that prevent human beings on this planet from realizing and tapping into their own divinity. Our sharp tool for accomplishing this psychological surgery is DECONSTRUCTION. Our endeavor is a catabolic one and, therefore, it flies in the face of those desirous of remaining moribund within the emotional and mental comfort zones. Our deconstructive model and approach reveals the means and mechanics of how the authority of man’s intrinsic Selfhood has been molested by the connoisseurs of deception, by those with a great deal to lose should the subjects under their hypnotic power awaken and become ignited by the Spirit of Rebellion that lies dormant within them. It is this spirit, after all, that is exemplified by the great saviors of the world. All of them, from Tonatiuh, to Odin, to Christ, to Socrates, were rebels , iconoclasts and outcasts. And yet, each was sent to the world by the higher power to execute the will of the so-called “Holy Spirit.” Rebellion, the hallmark of all light-bringers, Servant of Truths and Saviors is, therefore, a true service to the Holy Spirit. Rebellion against those authorities, systems, or ideas that attempt to molest, impede or confound our sacred individuality, sovereignty and true voice, constitutes service to the Holy Spirit. Rebelliousness is the hallmark of the Holy Spirit. Little wonder then that the Christians personified this Spirit of Rebellion as Lucifer the fallen angel. Little wonder that they obscured the actual significance of the Holy “Ghost.” Little wonder that they frown on the modern outcasts who will not conform to their mental whips or ingest their diet of intoxicating fictions.

The triskellion at Newgrange, County Meath, Ireland. The trinity was common in ancient Ireland, Egypt, and India. It was ancient when Christianity was born The Holy Spirit idea, which may be traced back to the feminine “Sophia” was referred to as \"Wisdom\" and was equated with knowledge and the love of knowledge. This knowledge may extend to the Son of God and then to God himself but must first begin with Self Knowledge . This is literally what Sophia of the Trinity is - Knowledge of the Self . The conspiring forces that sought to make this Self Knowledge taboo and who distorted and complicated our understanding and veneration of the true Holy Spirit were attempting to blot out the Self from the Holy Trinity and from the spiritual canon. To imagine the Holy Spirit to be some vague presence or to imagine it to be some indefinable aspect of the Virgin Mary, a white ethereal dove, an abstract metaphysical principle, or an inexplicable mystery, suited the desires of the Christian priesthood, but it denied their flock their most valuable key to the gates of salvation. What we were not told is that without the key to Knowledge of the Self, the others keys, should they even come into our possession, are worthless. It is this journey of self discovery that true mystics embark upon and that sincere philosophers aspire to. But this safari, this trek into the jungles of the Self, was regarded as a reprehensible and even lethal enterprise to those plotting the charts of official religion. And so it was decided that the first and highest priority lay in instilling the wholly false notion that man receives enlightened from without, after penance and after the performance of certain fixed rites overseen by the priests that he must unquestionably revere, serve, and sustain. The \"Holy Ghost,\" of the ensconced priesthoods, is something that \"descends\" upon a man from outside. It is not something that awakens from within his own being. It is something sent by another from outside. This implication was enough to send man out of his own being and into the hands of deceivers seeking to rape him of his own inner wealth. In truth, there is no enlightenment outside oneself. There is nothing worth attaining that does not originate within one's own being. If there is such a thing as enlightenment it cannot be found in the company of gurus, priests, or experts. Only its antithesis can be found in such company. As the inscription at Delphi implied, it is only after a man has ended his own inner division and come to rational clarity over the mystery of himself that he can inherit true wisdom. Only then will that which is worth having make itself known. This idea can still be found expressed within the tomes of official religions. Such entries were probably either remnants of the heavily plagiarized Gnostic canon or clues left by higher minded clerics silently traveling upon their own personal \"Siddhartha Roads.\" Without father, without mother, without human descent; His life has neither beginning nor end; but, as the Son of God, abides as a Holy Priest continually - (Hebrews 7:3) Many stand outside at the door, but it is only the solitaries who will enter into the bridal chamber - Jesus Christ (Gospel of Thomas) As said, the knowledge of god, or even of the son of god, is worthless to the man who does not know the ways of his own being The chaos and debauch in our world today is the result of this lack of Self-Knowledge.

Wherever there have been powerful societies, governments, religions, or public opinions - in short, wherever there was any kind of tyranny, it has hated the lonely philosopher; for philosophy opens up a refuge for man where no tyranny can reach: the cave of inwardness, the labyrinth of the breast; and that annoys all tyrants - Fredrick Nietzsche ( Schopenhauer as Teacher )"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Yes, to jump over the bridge of Selfhood hoping to land on the ship leaving for paradise, is to fall and drown for sure in the cold, swirling, demon-infested depths of perplexity and insanity. “Self-Realization is necessary before God-Realization” was the motto of the Vedanta masters and sages. “Know Thyself,” were the words at the Delphic Oracle in Greece. The temple of the living God is “within” announced the Christian Christ. The message is simple: There is no enlightenment outside of the Self. Man is his own priest and woman her own priestess. The cardinal misconception, that we can receive our Satori and our bliss from someone or something other than the Self, has achieved more than a reinforcement of the “master-slave” dichotomy. As a philosophy and belief it is the antithesis of that which was taught by the Druid Magi of the ancient world. We understand that a rational man cannot say, like Christ is meant to have done, that: \"I and my Father are one,\" unless we are each first one within ourselves to begin with. The \"Father\" is complete, and if we are not, then how can we possibly find oneness with him or with anyone else? The Christian who imagines that being \"one” with the Father implies the abnegation of Selfhood is little more than a masochist. He acts sadistically to himself. He commits a cardinal sin with just this kind of illogical thinking. How can a mere nothing , a human zero , merge with God? After all, who is it that comprehends this state of oneness ? Logically it is only a Self that can merge or bond with God's Self. Anything else is fantasy. When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will know that you are the sons of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you are in poverty, and you are poverty - (Gospel of Thomas) You yourself are even another little world and have within you the sun and the moon and also the stars - Origen (Church Father, 3rd Century AD) You are the temple of God. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are - (1 Corinthians 3:16) The abnegation of Selfhood is tantamount to self-murder . Thanks to orthodox religion and its anti-human dogmas this sadism to the self is rampant throughout the world. We can find it in the East and in the West. Religion, government, and corporations exist, it seems, to rape men of their inherent sovereignty and to crush the Spirit of Rebellion . These forces are obscene contradictions to the true Holy Spirit. The Church, in particular, is not the agent of the Holy Spirit but its greatest enemy. A careful reading of the bible reveals how many passages are given over to the question of slavery and how endorsed it is by god and his terrestrial agents. The man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest...even that man shall die – (Deuteronomy 17:12) Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those whose are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. For it is commendable if a man bears up under pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God...But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God - (Peter 2:18-21) The same thing applies to the works of both Martin Luther and John Calvin. These two mentally deranged religious fanatics lived to see their irrational theological ideas infect entire nations. To their minds man was an absolute nothing. Men were sinful worms and were divided into those who would be saved and those who would be damned. There was nothing man could do to change his fate because God had decided on a man's fate before his birth. Therefore, total submission to God was man's sole function. For God wants to save us not by our own but by extraneous justice and wisdom, by a justice that does not come from ourselves and does not originate in ourselves but comes to us from somewhere else...that comes exclusively from the outside and is entirely alien to ourselves - Martin Luther ( Vorlesung uber den Romerbrief ) Nor can you find any other remedy than do deny yourself and discard all selfish considerations, and to devote your whole attention to the pursuit of those things which the Lord requires of you - John Calvin ( Institutes of the Christian Religion ) Once the abnegation of the Self is accepted, and once man is so humbled, he becomes weak and submissive. He does not exist for his own sake. He exists for God and for the Church that acts in God’s name. He also becomes putty in the hands earthly demigods. Interestingly, the same men who cajoled men to relinquish all sense of personal individuality and independence also compelled men to obey their earthly demigods without question. The sick contradictory attitudes of Martin Luther, toward power, independence and freedom, are apparent from his own words: Nothing is more poisonous, harmful or devilish than a man in rebellion ...even if those in authority are evil or without faith, nevertheless the authority and its power is good and from God...therefore wherever there is power and where it flourishes, there it is and there it remains because God has ordained it - ( Vorlesung uber den Romerbrief )"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"His scintillating logic regarding the evils of monarchy is revealed in the following passage: God would prefer to suffer the government to exist no matter how evil, rather than to allow the rabble to riot, no matter how justified they are in doing so...A prince should remain a prince no matter how tyrannical he may be. He beheads necessarily only a few since he must have subjects in order to be a ruler - ( Against the Robbing and Murdering Hordes of Peasants ) From these passages, we can see why the abnegation of Selfhood is subtly but deliberately enforced throughout the so-called \"civilized\" societies of the world. We can also see the consequences that arise from the eradication of a man's sense of Selfhood. We can see what kind of citizen is created and what kind of person. Indeed, it is the subjugation of Selfhood that has driven us perilously near to the gates of oblivion. Perhaps we can now understand why it is that a man cannot be “forgiven” for sins committed against the “Holy Spirit,” that is, against his own Higher Self . And perhaps we can understand why it was so vitally important for early Judeo-Christian mythmongers to obscure the identity of this feminine third party in the Blessed Trinity, symbolized by the dove. And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven - (Matt 12:31) Jesus said: “He who blasphemes against the Father will be forgiven, and he who blasphemes against the Son will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either on earth or in heaven” - (Gospel of Thomas) Yes, remove the Self from the Trinity and from the ontology and your demonic schemes of domination will succeed beyond your wildest expectations. Replace the Self in the metaphysic and your end is assured. Bring back the Self into the picture and we can follow the bright Dove of Truth homeward to the final place of rest and understanding. Symbolically speaking, we find it more than suggestive that the dove was chosen to represent the third party of the Blessed Trinity since it is not a Christian emblem. It is a very ancient pagan symbol. The origin of the mystical symbolism of the dove comes from astrology and from the gnosis of the ancient Stellar Cults. The dove is, in fact, the symbol for the sign of Scorpio that is one of the two signs of the zodiac connected to the Spirit of Rebellion . So, we find it more than significant that the symbol chosen to represent the Higher Self - the true Holy Spirit - should relate directly and undeniably to the spirit and act of Rebellion , and to the Spirit of Contradiction . Ergo, we find it more than significant that the bible should proclaim it to be the direst and most irredeemable of sins to contradict or violate the will of this Holy Spirit. Before the Cross, Christians were asked to take the Dove or the Ship as the symbol of the Christ. This was recommended by Clemens of Alexandria - Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky ( The Secret Doctrine ) Ayn Rand. Author, Philosopher and Light to America. Deafness to her words and warnings daily sinks Man and his World. Since we have been committing this \"sin\" non stop, age after age, it follows that we should indeed find ourselves struggling and choking in the webs of our own making. It stands to reason that humans are to be found floundering in an squalid swamp of non-issues, existing as prisoners in their own palaces, lacking the intelligence to know the danger they face. Therefore, we make it our task to draw attention to the significance to this sin against the Self. From the ending of this most mortal of sins comes a new rapport with that true Comforter, that eternal Daemon (Guardian) that has long worked for our awakening and arrival. Now that this is understood, we are in a good position to finally see the battlefield and the rival factions. Because of our new understanding we grow proficient in determining who the real misleaders are. They are those who would condemn, stifle, and even obliterate this supernal Spirit of Rebellion . They are those who would fashion for us oppressive political leviathans, inhuman psychopathic corporations, and repressive religions, to ensure that the Spirit that is essential to our existence is driven forth into the wilderness never to return. With that Great Spirit gone, lying in its unmarked grave, humans fall cringing at the mercy of the terror-wolves, the daylight vampires, and phantoms of death who crave our ruin. Thankfully, the one thing that never dies in this world at any time is the Spirit of Rebellion . It will remain there in some one or other, in some hermit, or poet, musician, playwright, or film-maker. It has been beaten and crushed many a time but it is going nowhere. So we can be truly thankful for that. We can, therefore, look to and rely upon this Great Spirit for salvation in the darkest and deadliest of times. We can learn to love the word \"NO!\" We can learn to love its refreshing adamantine sound. We can learn to rely upon the great Spirit of Rebellion physically and socially and we can also learn to rely upon it mentally. We need to become accustomed, even acclimatized, to the Spirit of Rebellion , because it is already moving in the world, and will soon make itself vividly apparent. When the Dove descends into our world it will, however, don a quite different garb, a different persona than the one we may be familiar with. The Dove is Scorpio and it represents the energy of Pluto. In psychological terms, Pluto is the “Shadow.” Symbolically speaking, it is nature’s psychic surgeon or organic hygienist that appears to cleanse the soul of all its toxicity and repressed debris so that it may be chastened and virginal enough to perhaps receive the clear elixir of truth.

Therefore, only those imprisoners of human minds and souls have something to fear from the coming \"Age of Revealing.\" As the Scorpionic thirteenth card of the Tarot shows ( Rider-Waite Deck ) it is only the popes and the kings and their progeny who will be leveled before Pluto’s great steed. Yes, it is only the emotionally, morally, and spiritually toxic amongst us, the \"People of the Lie,\" who have something to fear from the approach of Pluto's silver scythe. The rest can benefit from and even enjoy the healing that comes after the pestilence, the plague, and the offending virus has been eradicated. All we have to remember that is everything in our world is cleaned - our bodies our cars and our carpets. Only our emotions and psyche remain perpetually neglected and unhygienic . This is what the energy represented by Pluto comes in to correct. There is a reason why the word sanity is etymologically related to the word sanitary. The sanitary mind is sane, and the unsanitary mind is, by definition, unsane , and even insane. We must all face the fact that our leaders are certifiably insane, or worse - William S. Burroughs The gigantic catastrophes that threaten us today are not elemental happenings of a physical or biological order, but psychic events. To a quite terrifying degree we are threatened by wars and revolutions which are nothing other than psychic epidemics. At any moment several millions of human beings may be smitten with a new madness, and then we shall have another world war or devastating revolution. Instead of being at the mercy of wild beasts, earthquakes, landslides, and inundations, modern man is battered by the elemental forces of his own psyche - Carl Gustav Jung (German Psychologist) Most people do not see, understand, or care very much about this catastrophe of the planet because they are overwhelmingly preoccupied with grave psychological problems. The environmental crisis is rooted in the psychological crisis of the modern individual. This makes the search for an eco-psychology crucial; we must understand better what terrible thing is happening to the modern human mind, why it is happening, and what can be done about it - Glenn Parton ( The Machine in our Heads ) Till now man has been up against Nature. From now he will be up against his own nature - Dennis Gabor Thou shalt know; self-chosen are the woes that fall on men - how wretched, for they see not good so near, nor hearken to its voice - few only know the pathway of deliverance from ill - Pythagoras (Grecian Philosopher, 6th century BC) In short, the men and women who have done their spiritual homework and who are psychologically and morally hygienic have nothing to fear from the times ahead. What many paranoiacs, fear-mongers, and doomsday merchants imagine to be the countdown to extinction is actually the countdown to freedom. What many falsely imagine to be the instigation of a tyrannical “New World Order is, in fact, going to be the removal of all such draconian order from the world, forever. The saber-rattling and war-mania of the world’s power-elites is but a subconscious fear-reaction to the inevitable approach of change, a desperate and futile attempt to offset the coming Plutonic storms that will demolish all that is infirm and toxic from the soul and from the world. With the world in turmoil, with fear oozing from every mind, and with terror radiating from every brain, the bestial world misleaders can feel more comfortable. We all prefer to be in an ambience that reflects our inner state.

Scorpio is the eighth house of the twelve houses of the zodiac, and Aquarius is the eleventh house. There are many fascinating mathematical and numerological relationships between the numbers eight and eleven and there are, likewise, many interesting correspondences between Scorpio and Aquarius. One of the fundamental correspondences involves the planet of rebellion, Uranus. Uranus is the planetary “ruler” of the sign of Aquarius and is “exalted” (of greatest power) in Scorpio. “New Age” philosophy expounds the idea that we are gradually approaching the so-called “Age of Aquarius.” As I show in my work on astrology, we are indeed coming to the close of one great astrological cycle and we are about to enter another. Along the way are other important mini-cycles that open and close and naturally there are the cycles of our own personal lives that are also major factors in the movement and changes of the celestial clock. However, this is not the place to explain the details of astrological prophecy or expound on the sundry notions regarding the “Age of Aquarius.” I merely wish to underline the rebellious quality that will rise to prominence under Aquarian and Uranian energy, and attend the world of tomorrow.

If thou wilt know the invisible, open wide thine eyes on the visible - Kabalistic Adage Aquarius and Uranus rule the spirit of youth that is akin to the Spirit of Rebellion . The coming of Uranus can be compared to a meeting between an extremely caffeinated and ticked-off Bruce Lee meeting an extremely hyper and histrionic Jackie Chan. As we can imagine, there won’t be much left of the furniture after they get through talking over their problems. Uranus is the planetary ruler of the famous Fool card in the Tarot. The Fool represents the innocent, sensitive, vital mind that is ever receptive, unconditioned, mutable, and free. He is the androgynous one who travels without a load of attachments and who allows neither fear nor memory to interfere with his mutable, omnidirectional journey of experience. He perfectly embodies the Taoist's Wei Wu Wei (accomplishment without action). To him the world always appears new, fresh, interesting and magical. This does not mean that the Fool does not also see the injustice and perversity that exists around him. He sees all the suffering and sorrow and laments it deeply. His spirit is after all Plutonic and Uranian. His spirit is free and also deeply human but his solutions to problems are of a grass-roots variety. He despises complexity and prefers solutions that are ingenious yet simple and comprehensible. The Plutonic-Uranian mind does not require debates, pie-charts, graphs, boardroom decisions or ten-year plans to cut through Gordian Knots or to move proverbial mountains. The Uranian does not need to take a poll of the opinions of others to know what he should believe or when and how to act. Independence and individualism are not merely catch-phrases to him. He is suspicious when such terms are used to enslave rather than to liberate, when they proffer false security instead of true grounded integral sovereignty. Essentially, the Uranian Fool is a proverbial Fifth-Columnist or Agent Provocateur, working to bring down the crumbling and oppressive edifices and “dark satanic mills” that incarcerate the spirit of man. He is a true servant of the Holy Spirit, even if he does not look like one. ...do you know anything about a man going around playing a harmonica? He's someone you'd remember...instead of talking he plays...and when he better play, he talks - Sergio Leone ( Once Upon a Time in the West ) The Spirit of Rebellion and the return to Selfhood will be humankind’s salvation in the dark times that are approaching. We have already been feeling, seeing, and experiencing the subtle and not so subtle effects of Uranus and Pluto for some time now. The “Hippy” era of the 1960s was a perfect expression of the lower and more chaotic Aquarian-Uranian archetypes. The “Punk” era of the 1970s was a good example of lower frequency Scorpionic-Plutonic archetypes and the sexual promiscuity of the 80s and 90s was also a patently lower-octave symptom. Card 13 of the ancient Tarot. The skeleton is the Winter, and represents Nature's purification cycle, the Alchemists Mortificatio. We are still, however, to experience the higher purer manifestation of these archetypes although we will not have long to wait. The planet Pluto is presently about 24 degrees of the sign of Sagittarius and is on its way toward the first degrees of Capricorn. Capricorn is the sign of the zodiac ruled by Saturn the planet/archetype of time, order, government and oppression. When Pluto enters into this sign we can certainly expect quite sudden and profound changes to the most fixed, toxic and calcified areas of our lives. Furthermore, on its way toward the sign of Capricorn, Pluto will cross in front of the Galactic Meridian and pass in front of the center of the galaxy. Pluto's orbit of the zodiac takes approximately 250 years and as it comes back full circle to pass over and channel the energy of galactic center it enables all that is calcified and toxic to be exposed and removed. In the early part of 2007 the alignment will occur and the whole planet will feel the influences and ramifications. The locus of galactic center is known to occultists as the \"Black Sun,\" and is often depicted that way, as a black solar disk with 13 rays emitting from it. Bathed in the energy of the sacred central sun, all false and degenerate orders will suffer deconstruction. The masters of the world order will not sit by and allow the Spirit of Rebellion to work its miracles in the hearts of men. As in the days of old they have many a counter-plan devised to maintain their hegemony. The rise of evangelism, oppressive laws, and conservative governments are evidence of this reaction to the liberating energies of Pluto and Uranus."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The nature of Pluto is similar to that of the Hindu god Shiva...Pluto usually begins by breaking down a structure, then creates a new one in its place. The entire cycle of death, destruction and renovation is accompanied by tremendous powers, for Pluto is not a mild or even very subtle planetary influence. It brings decay at one level or another...It also rules the death and regeneration of the self, as old aspects of your life pass away...Pluto does not represent death in the literal sense, instead it refers to a metaphorical death, something that ceases to be - Robert Hand ( Planets in Transit ) In the intermediate years we will do well to educate ourselves as to how the architects of ruin, within the religious and political hierarchies, are likely to react to this influx of liberating energy. These well-established bastions of repression and oppression are, after all, not in the habit of just rolling out of the way and giving up the ghost and we can expect them to willfully react in concert to overcome the new paradigm and new modality of expression that seeks to breach their walls and invade their territory, so to speak. As we can see from an astrological study of the 1960s and '70s, the Saturnian forces of law, order, and oppression do not hesitate to retaliate and quell the Spirit of Rebellion . The agents of Saturnian, Solar and Martian energy (the governments, educational edifices, and official religions, etc) do know, however, that there are many long-term benefits to be gained from permitting short-term “angst-release” from the “Under-Classes” they manipulate and control. This is why there have been, in the past, certain high-profile bouts of rebellion and fleeting chaotic flickers of anarchy from the disenchanted and malcontented within society. As ex-rebels James Simon Kunen (Columbia University Activist) and Jerry Kirk (Black Panthers) will be only too happy to inform us, there are two main forms of rebellion - the soft and the hard. There is the “designer” or “chic” version that serves in the long run merely to reinforce the status quo. Then there is the authentic and radical form that attempts to, and occasionally succeeds in, countering and demolishing the rotten status quo. The masses of discontented and inwardly discomfited who consider themselves as being “against the system” (and this includes the majority of pseudo-Communists, pseudo-Anarchists, and so on) are usually of the first variety and are, therefore, easily duped and led. More often than not these soft-rebels are also highly duplicitous types, narcissistic and devious, desiring only to seize the reigns of power for themselves. After all, how many Stalins, Castros, Maos, and Mugabes of the world begin as fierce, zealous “opponents” of the status quo only to later become the fiercest and most zealous of oppressors? As William Blake wrote: \"...the fist that crushes the tyrants head becomes a tyrant in the tyrant’s stead.\" So, although the masters of the game may occasionally permit this soft designer-rebelliousness, they are ever vigilant against the true hard form should it ever threaten to appear. Immanuel Velikovsky. They don't come more rebellious than this. Ridiculed all his life, every one of his theories was eventually proven accurate. He personified the higher octave Uranian and Plutonian energies. They are dangerous because there are so many of them. It is one thing to have a few nuts or dissidents. They can be dealt with, justly or otherwise, so that they do not pose a danger to the system. It is quite another situation when you have a true movement - millions of citizens believing something, particularly when the movement is made up of society’s average, successful citizens - William Colby (Late Director of CIA) Where a majority are united by a common sentiment, and have an opportunity, the rights of the minor party become insecure. In a republican government the majority, if united, have always an opportunity. The only remedy is to enlarge the sphere\" (that is, unite all the States under a federal government) \"and thereby divide the community into so great a number of interests and parties that, in the first place, a majority will not be likely, at the same moment, to have a common interest separate from that of the whole, or of the minority; and, in the second place, that, in case they should have such an interest, they may not be so apt to unite in the pursuit of it - President James Madison ( Elliot's Debates , Vol. 5) Soren Kierkegaard. Considered the father of Existentialist Philosophy, As early as the 1800s, he warned against social alienation, the inauthentic life, and the loss of Selfhood. That spirit of constructive resistance and rebellion was present in Mikhail Bakunin, William Blake, William Wallace, and Che Guevara, and in the modern comedians Bill Hicks and Lenny Bruce. It was found in Giordano Bruno and Soren Kierkegaard, in Ezra Pound, Ayn Rand, Wilhelm Reich and Jiddu Krishnamurti. It is the holy daemon about to possess many people in the world, many of whom would not, at this moment, consider themselves to be rebels with any cause. There are many sleeping heretics in the world and they are soon to be awakened. However, there are certain rules that come with the package and certain laws that the rational rebel must acknowledge and master. Authentic rebels know that it is pointless and hypocritical to strive against external tyranny unless one has first combated their own inner repressive instincts and drives. The true rebel is not merely a rager against the machine or a campus malcontent. He is a student of oppression, repression, and slavery. He allows the forces he despises and opposes to be his best tutors and he observes these forces closely, in order to become minutely aware of their nature and behavior. He extrapolates and examines the anatomy of tyranny and comes to know cruelty, sadism, violence, injustice, and destruction intimately . The rebels who are going to matter and who will possess the rational power to affect proactive change are those who become “walking encyclopedias” of evil. There is not a nuance of it that eludes them. Having walked through Hades, to emerge again, the Servant of Truth is supremely qualified to"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"heal and revive the lost and ignorant people of the world. His power lies in his healthy attitude to the challenges of life and in his Spirit of Rebellion and Contradiction . His authority is a result of his psychological and attitudinal freedom, for it is this inner condition that exalts a man - even one whose body is bound in chains. back For more on this subject see the following links: 2012 - The Future of Mankind Webstream 2012 - Where History Ends (dvd) Origins of Evil (Webstream)"}]
