Usually you won't use this entire pacing and leading pattern unless you are giving a speech or have the ability to speak uninterrupted for a bit. Here are some examples of this pattern: 1. As you sit there, listening to the sound of my voice, thinking about the ramifications of what I'm saying, you'll find yourself starting to think, \"you know, he's really got a point\". And as you start to think that, and I continue speaking, you'll become convinced that in fact what I'm saying is right. As you make that decision now, you'll quickly move forward to several times in the future when having made this decision was a great thing to do. Then you can see your future, full of all the bright and powerful results that you'll continue to have and all because this makes so much sense. 2. As you read each word of this letter, letting your eyes move rapidly or slowly across the page, you'll find yourself becoming excited about taking action to change your life. This realization, becoming more and more important to you by the second, is true for the many reasons that it has been for this long. And since this is true, you'll find yourself getting more and more compelled to take the action I'm going to suggest you take at the end of this letter. This pattern will usually be used in the simpler and less wordy variety. The easiest way to think about this is in the: Cause and Effect Pattern X causes Y Usually the X is a Pace and the Y is a lead. Here are some examples of this pattern. 1.

Because . . . While I did label the word \"because\" as one of the 18 most powerful words, I didn't put it into it's own category. For our review, I want to really call your attention to it, however, because it has quite an impact on the listener. As you know, it falls into the category of cause and effect words. This is one of the best words to put after what you are requesting. It doesn't even matter if what you say after the word because makes much sense. In fact, sometimes it helps for what follows the word \"because\" to be less than logical. This is because once you have made your point (al la Polya and plausible reasoning), if you keep adding reasons for your argument, beyond what it takes to substantiate your argument, it'll only take one counter example to break your argument. 1.

Quotes You can use the quotes pattern to say something to someone that you might not ordinarily get away with saying. Or, you can also use it to hide suggestions effectively. 1. I was in a situation once just like this. The trainer came over to me and said, \"you really want to take this course don't you\"? I said that I did. He said, \"well, just go ahead. I know enough about what you're looking for so that I make sure personally that you'll get it, OK?\" So, I did it. 2. If I were in my shoes, I'd tell you to be quiet and stop interrupting or else. 3. A client told me of an employee who had a friend who came into a situation just like this and he said, \"look, do this for all the reasons that are important to you, not just because I want you to\" - and the man looked back at her and said, \"well, when you put it that way, it makes sense, doesn't it?\" 4. A famous man once said (point to self), \"following the leader is silly unless the leader is shown to have fore sight and skill in accomplishing the goals he sets not only for himself, but for the group he is leading (point to group) as well. 5. A friend of mine once experienced a difficult break up and she was skeptical about getting involved in another relationship quickly as well. But like she said, \"I really like you and if you don't take chances in life, what will you gain?\" You can use this pattern to install any suggestion in another person that you want.

As you listen to what I say, letting your mind focus on what I'm saying, you'll start to discover a powerful connection between us. It's as though your focus begins to narrow down, so you see me, zoomed in on perhaps my face. And as you listen closely considering what you're hearing with agreement while your unconscious just takes it all in as specific instructions for it to follow, you, enjoying the sensations more and more, find yourself thinking and acting in ways that support all your unconscious is hearing - NOW. this not only becomes fun, but the feeling of needing to continue to hear the next idea, the next suggestion is simply understood as a natural response, a welcomed one, as you become more and more relaxed. 2.

This is the way society keeps things in balance . By being the first to give, you can set the tone for the way you want to be treated in any relationship. The three rules of Reciprocity: 1. Be the first to give service. 2. Be the first to give information 3. Be the first to give concessions Social Influence R eciprocity"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Chinese Stratagems of Interest Strategy 10 - Knife Hidden Under the Smiling Face By inspiring trust in an opponent, they will let down their guard. An example is Pearl Harbor. Right up to the last minute, Japanese diplomats did everything they could to assure the U.S. that they wanted peace. At the last second, they showed the knife behind their smile (assurances of peace). As Chin-Ning Chu says in The Asian Mind Game. \"Beware of smiling faces and effusive displays of friendship at the negotiation table. You see this used by Asian people (no offense or slight meant to anyone of Asian Culture) often when they come to America and call Americans \"friend\" while looking at a car to buy etc. Then when it comes to the negotiation, they expect that they be given an extremely good price because of their \"friendship\". Strategy #17 - Trade a Brick for a Piece of Jade. This is the strategy of convincing someone that your \"brick\" or to apply it to the principle of Reciprocity, your favor or information or concession, is worth far more than it is actually worth. Depending on how you frame what you do, you may well be able to get more for your favor than it may ordinarily be worth. Each year Asian countries send delegations to the U.S. to purchase grain. They purchase it from one major broker. They then travel to each of the brokers offices in the different states for \"publicity opportunities\". This way, politicians in each of the states or local territories can take credit for bringing all this business to their area, thus making the politicians look good. This gets the Asians \"brick\", or price they pay for the grain, the value of Jade, or political influence in the U.S. Strategy #30 - Provoke Strong Emotion The ability to provoke strong emotion in another gives you the ability to control them. Consider state elicitation and Anchoring. The ability to get a soldier to face death without fear or die for his country is dependent on how well his anger and hatred are aroused and directed.

And all the images that come to mind that we were programmed to believe in connection with the words, communist or Russia etc. Use this strategy to elicit strong emotions from the person you are doing something for, thus creating additional value on your side that soon they'll have to reciprocate for. Scarcity - The Rule of the Rare The Rule - As objects of value become less available, they increase in value . Genuinely scarce information is far more valuable than easy to get or readily available information. A lot of information or services we provide is unique or exclusive or not readily available to the public. Make sure and point this out in your dealings. The Three Principles of Scarcity: 1. Emphasize genuine scarcity 2. Emphasize Unique Features 3. Emphasize exclusive information Asian Strategies of Interest Strategy #31- The Beauty Trap Often to get what they want, a woman will be offered to \"sweeten\" the deal. Since beauty is basically a rare commodity, and can't often be had when ever desired, it possesses power that can be wielded. By offering beauty in the form of a woman, they are potentially supplying a \"scarce\" item of pleasure at a time when it may most be valued. This also plays on reciprocity. Social Influence Scarcity"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Authority- Showing Knowing The Rule - It is believed that authorities will provide us with real, accurate, necessary and dependable information. We need to accept that information and act on it if we are to be successful or correct or legal etc. We are conditioned to accept the power of authority from birth. Here are some examples: The doctor rushing into the emergency room and ordering everyone to stand aside so that he can determine what is needed - red flashing lights in your mirror - a police officer directing traffic or a person that allows children to cross the street by holding a flag and directing traffic - The necessity of submitting to the state for a drivers license, marriage license, business license etc., a judge giving a ruling, etc. These have all been conditioned into us either via direct experience or through television, movies, the media and/or stories conveyed to us by credible others. The four principles of authority: 1. Establish your position through professionalism 2. Establish your position through knowledge 3. Establish your position through your credentials 4. Establish your position through admitting weaknesses at the outset Asian Strategies of Interest Strategy #18 - Defeat the Enemy by Capturing Their Chief This strategy, while not directly allowing us to create authority, does point out the power of authority. This strategy also applies to several other rules of social influence such as reciprocity. The key here is to discover what the chief wants then give it to him or her. This ability is based on your ability to understand the chief.

Sun Tzu Bing-Fa Consensus - People Proof, People Power The Rule - When people don't know what to do in an unfamiliar situation, they look to others actions and behaviors for an answer. When other people, especially groups of others, or important (authority) others do something, we tend to believe that it is the right thing to do. Our country is based on the rule of the majority. As kids, we voted to determine our activities - and the majority ruled. Letting the people you want to influence know that others like them are doing what you are suggesting.

The power of this strategy comes from the fact that if \"consensus\" holds that you are going to do one thing (your feint), people will believe and act accordingly. Thus they are genuinely surprised when your \"attack\" comes from the West. Consistency and Commitment The Rule - Consistency of behavior, thoughts and words is very valuable and we strive for it. This enables us to change our behavior to get what we want because we \"know\" that others behavior will be consistent. When others don't act with consistency, we perceive discomfort and anxiety. After people purchase tickets at a race track, they believe that their horse has much higher chances of winning - where before purchasing the tickets, they only believed the horse had an average chance of winning. They act with consistency with their commitment (ticket purchase). The five principles of consistency and commitment 1. Start small and build. (pacing and leading) 2.

In A.D. 755 An Lu San's army attacked a city in the Henan Province (no, I don't know where that is). This army's forces were superior to the Emperor's forces inside the city. The city was commanded by Zhang Xuen, and he decided he would defend his city to the last man. The cities commander ordered many thousands of straw men to be made by the inhabitants of the city. The straw men were dressed like soldiers and then tied to ropes and lowered over the city walls. An Lu San's soldiers thought these were real soldiers preparing to attack, so they fired hundreds of thousands of arrows and the them. Zhang's soldiers pulled the straw men back up, taunting An Lu San's soldiers and thanking them for all the arrows. After a little time passed, Zhang ordered five hundred real soldiers to be lowered over the walls. An Lu San's soldiers didn't shoot because they thought it was another ploy to make them waste arrows. The real soldiers proceeded to charge the enemy outside the city and defeated them. Another example of this is during the Korean war the Americans and the Chinese often faced each other from their respective positions for long periods of time. The Chinese would rattle empty cans at night to make noises to upset and disturb the Americans. After a time, the Americans would grow used to the noise. At this point the Chinese would attack using the cover of banging cans.
