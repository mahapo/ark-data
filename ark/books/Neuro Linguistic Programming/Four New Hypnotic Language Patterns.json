[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Four New Hypnotic Language Patterns John Burton, Ed.D. Addressing maladaptive (unconscious) parts with hypnotic language sentences them to the linguistic gallows. They hang on your every word. This article identifies four additional hypnotic language composition patterns. Distraction The first relates to placing a phrase within a collection of other statements. The imbedded statement must be quite out of place or context from the rest of the preceding text. It can occur one of two general ways. The first form constructs the imbedded statement in a metaphorical manner. It may appear at any time within the conversation but is jolting and confusing in effect. This forces the receiver to go on a search for meaning. Undergroun d sprinkler heads must know when to rise up and wet the lawn and also know when to stop. The remainder of the conversation simply proceeds as if there was no unusual interjection. This way the person is left lingering on the phrase that is the exception to the rule. Another way to use distracting statements imbedded within text is just for occupying the conscious mind. The words may have no particular meaning but serve to distract the security guard or conscious mind. Following the jolt the speaker may no w have unobstructed access to the unconscious mind. Why are firetrucks red? This is the perfect place for placing imbedded commands or addressing that which you know is true for the listener. Logic The third pattern considers the use of logic as a basic means of inducing hypnosis. When speaking in logical terms we find the listener follows the chain of words until they find themselves linked to the inevitable conclusion (collapsing linguistic anchors). If we want the listener to follow our words in the di rection we desire for their own good then we can structure them in logical terms because if we hook together undeniable facts then the last fact is as true as the first fact which makes us have to follow what is now our own logic, doesn ’ t it? If you use this method I hope you will be sure to comprise your sentences of undeniable facts. If you comprise your sentences of undeniable facts then the client will naturally agree. If the client naturally agrees, then you can help them to see and feel what you know is true and good for them. Then the client will see and feel what is true and good for them. As a result now the client will operate from more resourceful states. So if you use this method your clients will operate from more resourceful states. Spelling Another addition to hypnotic language patterns utilizes spelling out of key or crucial words when speaking them to the listener. As you speak to the client you may construct various hypnotic patterns but when you come to the pivotal or change making statem ents, s - p - e - l - l, literally spell them out for the person. The result is the client takes in the information in an unassembled state. The mind naturally wants to make sense of that which makes no sense. As a result the person carries the important information deeper into their mind for processing. The consequence is felt"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"more deeply. So that we can encourage our client to make this change n - o - w and live that which they deeply feel and know is t - r - u - e for themselves. We then finally suggest the client l - i - v - e what is n - o - w... t - r - u - e... f - u - l - l - y. Deductive Reasoning The final supplement to hypnotic language patterns comes in the form of deductive reasoning. In fact it is not unlike the previous pattern although the former sort of employs the latter on a fulltime basis. Spelling out words uses deductive reasoning as the receiver is given parts that are known to assemble into familiar wholes. The only way they can assemble into familiar wholes is through deductive reasoning. This principle can apply more broadly o n its ’ own. For example, what do you call a long cylindrical shaped piece of wood filled with a wire - width line of lead running down the middle and a pink rubbery substance on top? What state do you go into in order to identify the object? A trance - state happens. By the way, this also illustrates the difference between sensation (general stimulation of the senses) and perception (meaning making from the stimulation contents). Given this state is the general road to accessing and utilizing resource states we can use the pathway known as deductive reasoning as another means of getting there. Consider the following example. What goes on inside you when considering an issue that is distressing? Certain feelings or states occur. Now separately, what do you call the state that combines the ingredients you know as patience, real patience,....with foresight, looking into your future so you will know the present consequences a well as knowing what you will need then so you can act in accordance now.... and then finally a dd the state you know as flexibility, committed to a general outcome not a specific method? What do you have when these ingredients are combined now? This process invites creating a meta - state of their own by using deductive reasoning to conclude what the creation is now that the specific elements are added together. We can then use this meta - state as a healing resource by stating the following: \"What do you get now when this is applied to that other state?\" Consider the many ways that these language patte rns may be used in the process of assisting others in gaining needed internal resources. They can act as a snowplow clearing a path right up to the unconscious part. You will then find free access to the abundant resources within the individual. They can also play the role of the change agent itself. These and the other hypnotic language patterns permit extracting of \"thought weeds\". This makes way for cultivating and harvesting healthy fruitful states. E - mail John Burton: jkburton@charter.net <mailto:jkbu rton@charter.net> "}]
