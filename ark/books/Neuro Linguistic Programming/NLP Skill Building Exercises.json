I have heard that Richard Bandler required his NLP Practitioner students to write out 100 examples of each of these patterns. You may want to do that also. By using presuppositions, we are able to make a statement and have basic assumptions contained in that statement accepted, unconsciously, as being true. See \"Advanced Language Patterns Mastery\" for more information on presuppositions and how to purchase this skill building manual. The real \"power\" of using presuppositions comes from using 3, 4 or more of them together. Of course, to be able to chain many presuppositions together means that we must first learn to use each one of them individually and then move on to grouping them together. It has been said that when 3 presuppositions are used in a row that it is impossible not to accept the embedded presuppositions/assumptions. The themes that I will use in demonstrating each pattern, as we work through these exercises are: \"To be an excellent communicator you will need to learn the importance and use of non−verbal communication.\" Here I will presuppose that in order to be a good communicator you must know how to use the 93% of communication that is non−verbal. • and \"Creating and maintaining rapport is critical to building or enhancing a relationship.\" Here I will presuppose that getting and maintaining rapport is crucial to building a relationship.\" • Pick one, two or more themes for yourself to use throughout the month or if you wish pick a different theme(s) for each language pattern − your choice. Week 1 Day 1 Practice using \"Some Quantifiers\" − ( ALL, EACH, EVERY, SOME, FEW, MANY, NONE) In my case I'll take the theme number 1: \"To be an excellent communicator you will need to learn the importance and use of non−verbal communication.\" and write an example: Every one I know who is really excellent at communicating has mastered the use of non−verbal communication. Now I'll take the theme number 2: \"Creating and maintaining rapport is critical to building or enhancing a relationship.\" Here I will presuppose that getting and maintaining rapport is crucial to building a relationship and write an example for this pattern: Few people really understand that creating and maintaining rapport is so critical to building relationships.

Of course, to be able to chain many presuppositions together means that we must first learn to use each one of them individually and then move on to grouping them together. It has been said that when 3 or more presuppositions are used together that it is impossible not to accept the embedded presuppositions/assumptions. If you have not completed the previous exercises on presuppositions − posted in October, 95 or do not have existing experience in their use − please stop and complete those exercises, now. The previous, as well as the following exercises, are designed to assist you in learning how to use the majority of the 29 different presuppositions. However, once you have consciously learned to use each of them − you will find it easy to combine the use of 3, 4 or more of them together. After you have learned how to do this, it is no longer necessary to know which of the 29 presupposition you have used. Knowing the names of the presuppositions used will be irrelevant. All you want to be able to do is to string 3, 4 or more of them together so as to make it consciously impossible for the anyone to disagree with all of your assumptions. You will then begin using them on an unconscious level. You will be surprised and delighted with the results you get. Please be aware that language patterns will work best after you have established rapport or elicited an emotional state where the thought, action or behavior would occur. For our exercises this month we will be using these contexts : Week 1 − This week we will practice using these language patterns in the context of non−verbal communication. Week 2 − This week's context is sales and selling. Week 3 and Week 4 Week 3's context is personal development and Week 4's context is hypnosis. Week one, I will continue to use the 2 themes from the October exercises and demonstrating how to use several patterns together. \"To be an excellent communicator you will need to learn the importance and use of non−verbal communication.\" Here I will presuppose that in order to be a good communicator you must know how to use the 93% of communication that is non−verbal. • and \"Creating and maintaining rapport is critical to building or enhancing a relationship.\" Here I will presuppose that getting and maintaining rapport is crucial to building a relationship.\" • Stop now and choose a theme or two that are important to you −− something that will help you get the results you want.

Use those times. You need not take risks. Practice everyday in all kinds of situations −− enjoy the process. Assume an attitude of adventure, of playing and practical learning. The more you enjoy the adventure, the more and deeper will be your learning. Increase your learnings by noting what you have observed each day in the space provided or in your NLP journal. If you should happen to not be familiar with or understand basic NLP, a basic NLP book such as \"Introducing to NLP (Neuro−Linguistic Programming)\" by Joseph O'Connor and John Seymour will help you become familiar enough with it to be able to use these exercises.

For example, you may want to add confidence to other areas of your life. One of the great things about the Circle of Excellence anchoring technique is that it can be used to anchor any resourceful state that you may wish.

Hold that state for at least a count of ten but remain in the circle for as long as you can hold that state Separator State \"Step back out of the circle,\" and then quickly think of something different − a neutral state. Test Anchor \"Step back in the circle\" and make sure the resource is automatically re−accessed. If the response is not automatic, repeat the above steps, making sure you are fully associated into the state of excellence. Identify a Context (Time and Place) When You Want Excellence \"Think of a time or situation in the future when you would like to have more of this state of excellence.\" Link State of Excellence to This Context Ask yourself \"What will let me know its time to have those resources available?\" \"How might things go wrong in that future situation?\" As soon as you begin to access the \"problem\" situation, step into the circle. Be sure that you accesses the resource state. When the resource state is accessed, step back out of the circle and create a separator state. Test and Make Sure its Automatic in the Future Again think about another future situation where you would like to have this resource state. Think of a time in the future when this problem might occur? Where? With whom? As you just begin to get the problem state response to make sure that it occurs only briefly and step into the circle so as to automatically access the new state of excellence.

To stack anchors, hook one anchored experience onto another and onto another etc. For example: Remember an intense moment of joy. See what you see, hear what you hear and feel what you feel. As the feeling reached it's peak − touch your middle finger and thumb together, hold it for at least a count of five. Break the state. Test the state by again putting your middle finger and thumb together (this is called firing the anchor). Repeat these instructions until you automatically get a state of intense joy state by firing the anchor. Now add humor, by accessing a time you really were enjoying something humorous. Follow the same procedure as above. See what you see, hear what you hear and feel what you feel. As the feeling reached it's peak − touch your middle finger and thumb together, hold it for at least a count of five. Break the state. Test the stare by again putting your middle finger and thumb together. You will experience a feeling that is a mixture of both joy and humor.

For example, bringing the picture closer and brightening a picture may make you want it more. For example: find an area where you want a strong motivation anchor, stack past examples of your successes, and for each example move the picture closer and make it brighter. As an example, as a salespeople, think back to times when you really were motivated to sell. Make the picture 3−D and the size of a football field. Increase the intensity. Anchor that state. Notice which submodality changes makes you feel more motivated. Anchor that feeling with a visual, auditory or kinesthetic anchor.

A relaxation anchor can also he \"created\" during any experiences when you are already deeply relaxed such as while in the bath or listening to relaxing music. Memorize your internal kinesthetics, notice your breathing, and your body kinesthetics as you fire a specific anchor.

Uptime in NLP means being in a state where you are very tuned in to external sensations. An \"Uptime\" anchor − an important resource to have available. A powerful uptime anchor can be created by finding a some place in your life where you have particularly enjoyed an enhanced sensory experience. Start by selectively focusing on visual, kinesthetic, auditory and olfactory experiences as you set a specific kinesthetic anchor. (i.e., a specific touch, make a fist, or hold your wrist, etc.) See what you see, hear what you hear and feel what you feel. As the feeling reached it's peak − touch your right middle finger and thumb together, hold it for at least a count of five. Practice focusing and tuning your awareness exclusively to your external environment, screening out your other systems by closing your eyes or blocking out sounds.. Seeing things − Focus on forms, shapes, colors, brightness, and movement around you, using both panoramic and detailed viewing. When fully engaged visually. Set your anchor. Hearing It all − Listen for the differences in sounds around you and notice where each of the sounds are located. Listen to intonation patterns and tempo of any voices near you and to the sounds around you. When your auditory channels are fully tuned to awareness. Set your anchor."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Engage all your feelings − Feel the textures and shapes of objects around you.

Smell What's Here! − Smells go straight to the brain without any filtering. Notice the smells in the air and environment. What smells are there? Which is strongest? Are there other, more subtle smells? Take note of tastes, also. When your smell awareness and tastes are most enhanced. Set your anchor. Selectively focus in on each sense system, begin to tune into all channels simultaneously so that your attention is completely engaged with your external environment. Set your anchor as you do this and continue to repeat this until you are completely satisfied.

Pick out a distinctive but neutral gesture or body position which you can easily do but don't tend to do as a matter of habit. When you are in an interaction, notice when a person is in a very positive emotional state (facial animation, voice, body movement, etc.) and identify the person's own personal anchors, Often the person will make a particular visual gesture, adopt a certain body position. make a particular sound, or use certain words when in a positive emotional state, These anchors when repeated by the communicator will re−trigger that positive state in the person. Concentrate on visual anchors. So while the person is in a positive state, set a visual anchor. Each time that state comes up again, repeat the anchor. When the person is in a neutral state, test the anchor by firing the visual anchor and notice how strongly you elicit that same positive emotional state. Calibrate. Do they return to the same insensitive positive state? Use the visual anchor you have established whenever appropriate to the situation and outcome. How can you use this on an ongoing basis? ________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________ Week Three − DAY 4 Evoking A Response and Setting an Auditory Anchor Today practice evoking a response using auditory tonal anchors with words, i.e., you might ask another person"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"using an \"excited\" tonality and tempo. \"What's it like when you remember a time when you were readily excited about something?\" Anchor the response with a simple phrase in a specific, intonation pattern, i.e., \"O−KAY\", \"great\" etc. Remember, pick out sounds or words that you can repeat exactly but don't use as a habit. Try several. When you set and then fire your anchors later, do you get most or at least some aspects of the anchored physiology? Normally people usually don't go from resting state to an intense state such as \"excited\" − in one smooth move with one fired anchor. Usually, what you will get when you fire your anchor is a portion of the former \"excited\" physiology. ________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________ Week Three − DAY 5 Evoking A Response and Setting a Kinesthetic Anchor Today develop a specific kinesthetic anchor you can use with others. Pick \"touches\" that are both unique and can be easily added to your normal interactions with a variety of people − i.e., hand on shoulder or spot on back, touch to hand etc. Set and fire a kinesthetic anchor as an interactional gesture, repeat it a couple of times today. Add this and other kinesthetic anchors to your personal anchoring repertoire and develop how and where you might use them in future.

There are several skills necessary to be able to communicate irresistibly. These skill really are about influence and persuasion. Some of these skills are: Establishing and maintaining rapport. Be sure that you are matching the other person exactly. Start off with a second or two delay in your matching or mirroring and then move to matching the other person almost simultaneously within a minute or two. Avoid matching the other person using subtle matches. This is not a match − do and move exactly as they do. The only way to get into deep rapport is to be willing to do what they do − 100% the same. 1. Having a definite outcome. Set an outcome for everything you do. If your are to influence and persuade you must know the outcome you want to achieve. 2. Using Advance Language Patterns. We have already practiced some of the Advanced Language Patterns. Using 3, 4 or more of them in combination will make it impossible for the conscious mind to recognize and negate all of the suggestions. Refer to \"Advanced Language Patterns Mastery\" and the previous exercises for using presuppositions, cause and effect, embedded commands, single and double binds etc. 3. Verbal pacing and leading . We will be learning more about this in this month's exercise. We will be pacing what is undeniably true and leading to what we want to be believed as true or what has yet to be established as being true. 4. Eliciting or creating emotional states. Basically we are talking about having the ability/skill to either elicit or create an emotional state in the other person, that is the perfect emotional state for them to be in if they were to naturally go ahead and carry out the mutually beneficial suggestion or action. This includes the ability to be able to put yourself into this state (all your verbals and non−verbals will indicate you are in this state) before you create or elicit the same emotional state in others. 5. Matching the other person's criteria . Eliciting and matching exactly the other person's criteria for the context you wish to influence and persuade. Utilizing criteria is critical!! (More about this in future exercises) 6. Matching process/strategy. Irresistible influence and persuasion is obtained when you are able to determine the process/strategy the other person uses. Again this is context dependent. Find out their process and put your content into that process and it will be absolutely irresistible to them. (More about this in future exercises). 7. O.K., on to what this skill building exercise is about. Verbal pacing and leading. When I first started learning about NLP, I learned about pacing, to get rapport, and leading to an outcome.

Naturally as we have in the past, we will continue to keep in mind that we are using these processes based on being in − or creating long term relationships. REVIEW As we have discussed over the last few months, there are several skills necessary to be able to communicate irresistibly. Some of these skills are: Establishing and maintaining rapport. 1. Having a definite outcome. 2. Using Advance Language Patterns. Refer to \"Advanced Language Patterns Mastery\" 3. Verbal pacing and leading . If you completed last two months exercise you are gaining more proficiency in using verbal pacing and leading along with Advanced Language Patterns. 4. Eliciting or creating emotional states. The subject of this month's exercises. Basically we are talking about having the ability/skill to either elicit or create an emotional state in the other person, that is the perfect emotional state for them to be in if they were to naturally go ahead and carry out the mutually beneficial suggestion or action. This includes the ability to be able to put yourself into this state (all your verbals and non−verbals will indicate you are in this state) before you create or elicit the same emotional state in others. 5. Matching the other person's criteria . 6. Matching process/strategy. 7. O.K., on to what this skill building exercise is about. Lets focus on Skill #5 − eliciting and creating emotional states to improve our ability to influence and persuade as well as build rapport. Eliciting and Creating Emotional States. Before we actually get into Eliciting and Creating Emotional States, let's review a little of what I call working theory or what is it that makes this work so well and so easily. We'll briefly look at these important concepts. Start with an outcome in mind. What is the \"emotional state\" you want to produce in yourself and in the other person. 1. Almost anything is possible when you are in rapport with someone. 2. To create an emotional state in someone else you must first put yourself in that state. 3. The mind cannot tell the difference between a very intense recalled emotional experience and a very intensely imagined emotional experience. 4. When a person is immersed in a past emotional experience, with a feeling of present reality, they will relive that experience exactly as the memory was incorporated at the time it actually happened. In other words they will actually get into that \"intense\" emotion right here and right now as you are speaking to them. 5. It is possible to chain a series of states together to lead a person from say curiosity to commitment. 6."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Please note we will only cover just the very basics here. In order to understand this let's assume that we are going to influence or persuade someone to act or think in a certain way that would be mutually beneficial to them and to us. So, let's go through the above concepts one at a time and learn now exactly how it works. Believe me, it is worth your time to understand these concepts and use them continually in all your communication. Now, lets move on. Out major outcome will be to influence or persuade someone to act or think in a certain way. Start with an outcome in mind. In this case the outcome is to produce a certain useful state in someone. Outcome = what is the \"emotional state\" you want to produce. For example if you were a salesperson, you might want to create a state of curiosity about your product or service. Determine what state would it be natural for the person to be in to do or think the way we know would be beneficial to them and us. i.e. curiosity. • Anything is possible when you are in rapport with someone. Get into rapport with the person. You presuppose that you are in rapport. i.e. act as if you already have rapport. • Be sure that you are matching the other person exactly . Yes, exactly. • Initially start off with a second or two delay in your matching or mirroring. • Then move to matching the other person almost simultaneously within a minute or two. • Avoid matching the other person using subtle matches. This is not a match − do and move exactly as they do. • The only way to get into deep rapport is to be willing to do what they do − absolutely 100% the same. • To create an emotional state in someone else you must be in that state. Establish rapport. Decide what state you want to elicit or create. • Then in your own mind get into the same emotional state that you want the other person to have. • Elicit or create the state as described below. • The mind cannot tell the difference between a very \"intense\" emotional experience recalled from the past and a very \"intense\" emotional experience created in the imagination. Any emotional state can be produced at will − right here − right now! • The sights, sounds and feelings of an emotional experience are \"super glued\" or linked together. So by eliciting or creating one of them we will automatically bring in the others. i.e. if we were to get a person to feel curious they will automatically bring into mind the total experience with all the visual •"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"and auditory components. We can create an emotional state just by describing it in a certain way. • Eliciting and Creating Emotional States. Hypnotist talk about re−vivification. In re−vivification, the person is immersed in the experience, reliving it exactly as the memory/experience was incorporated at the time it actually happened. Re−vivification, we'll equate it to state elicitation from now on, is much more common than most people realize. Excellent communicators use it all the time. Sales people, politicians, therapists, talk show hosts, religious leaders use state elicitation to get listeners to relive previous experiences. These experiences can either be positively or negatively charged. Basically we can get another person to immediately experience any mood or emotion − at will. What are some of the states will be extremely useful in our communication? Curiosity • Frustration • Open to new possibilities • Committed • Convinced • Strong connection • Wanton desire • Confidence • Trust • Loyalty • Excitement • etc., etc., etc. • Let's use the above example of a sales person wanting to get his customer into a state of curiosity about his product or service. Our outcome then is to get the other person into a state of curiosity and link that state to our product. How would we go about it? Naturally this is harder to explain that to actually do. I'll be the salesperson and you can take the position of a person who is interested in improving your communication by using Advanced Language Patterns to improve your results. You can be my friend, John. Here's the process First, I decide on the state − curiosity. Then I ask myself, what are the components that make up the state of curiosity. For example what would a person be thinking, seeing, hearing, feeling or doing if they were actually in a state of curiosity. Here's what I came up with. Components of Curiosity: Begin to wonder about it. 1. Peaks my interest. 2. Ask myself questions. 3. Continually comes to mind. 4. There's something in here for me. 5. What can I learn here? 6."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Now , I use these components and Advanced Language Patterns to tie them together and elicit the state of curiosity. For example: I don't know about you, John, but so many of my customers tell me that when you first learn about Advanced Language Patterns, you begin to get really curious and want to learn even more about it. And it is so natural. It's like, have you ever had a time in your life when you notice that there is something happening and you just begin to wonder about it. And no matter what you are doing, whether it's during the day or during the night, it keeps popping into your mind and that makes you even more curious about it. Somehow it's really able to peaks your interest to the point where you just can't stop thinking about it until you find out more about it. And the more you continue to think about it, the more you become even more curious about it. And as you do that, you find yourself asking yourself these questions. \"What's this all about?' \"How does this work?\" \" What can I learn here?\" It's like you're saying to your self, \"I don't know what's really going on here but it seems like what's going on here is so full of opportunities and I like it. I don't know exactly what it is yet, but there's something here that is really important for me.\" And as you think about Advanced Language Patterns, it's exactly those kind of thoughts and feelings that you and others become aware of. It's really amazing that it does happen just like that, over and over again, until you take the action you need to take to satisfy your curiosity. Now, is there something that I can do to help you get the results you want? Or Isn't it interesting how people think, John, like if you were to think of something that you've been curious about in the past. Something that somehow gets into your mind, and it's there and no matter what you're doing; sometimes during the day or during the night it continues to pop into your mind until you actually do something about it. It's like maybe ever time you look into a mirror and see yourself, it pops into your mind and you wonder about it and how it can help you. And you somehow know deep down inside of you there is something that you have to find out about; no matter what it takes or what it costs, you'll do what ever it takes right now or within a very short time. Perhaps within a day or too at the latest, because you understand that you have a need to satisfy that curiosity within you. And that's the interesting thing about people, John., it happens just like that. It's really very interesting, isn't it? These are two quick examples of how you might take the components/structure of curiosity and then elicit that state in someone else. How we can then chain curiosity to another state will be covered in future exercises. This month's exercise will be in interactive exercise between you and me. Together we will develop the components/structure of four different states. And then we will write our the language we could use to elicit each of the states in someone. The interactive part takes place when you email me the results of your thinking. I really will appreciate it when I get this feedback and will publish the most common components for each emotional state.

Please note we will only cover just the very basics here. In order to understand this let's assume that we are going to influence or persuade someone to act or think in a certain way that would be mutually beneficial to them and to us. Start with an outcome in mind. What is the state that you would like them to be in at the end of the process so that they will naturally be able to act or think in a way that is beneficial to both of you. For our exercise we will chain 3 states together. We will use some of the states that we learned to elicit in past exercises − slightly modified to fit the context we will be using. So, we will be chaining three states together. State A to State B to State C"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Curiosity (A) to Open To New Possibilities (B) to Future Success (C) For our example we will assume that the person has expressed some Curiosity − which we will deepen and then link to Open To New Possibilities and then link to Future Success. We could, of course, have to paced and led the person from whatever state that they were currently in − if it was not Curiosity, into Curiosity (A). We could do that by linking their present on−going experience to Curiosity with some of our Advanced Language Patterns that we have already learned − such as cause and effect. i.e. You came to my web site and began to read some of the words that were written there. And as you read, you had thoughts. And having had those thoughts caused you to begin to become very curious about how you could use this valuable information in your everyday life. etc. Most of the time when we are chaining states from one state to another state may require too large of a state shift to go directly from the state that they are in to the desired end state. So, one or two intermediate states may be required. In our example to shift someone from Curiosity to Future Success would be too big of a jump. Therefore, we are using an intermediate state of Open To New Possibilities. We'll use that same context that we used to elicit curiosity in Skill Builder #7, which will help us integrate the exercises. The context is that of a sales person wanting to get their customer into a state of Curiosity about their product or service, begin to see what the New Possibilities are and as a result of using the product or service they will experience Future Success. We will use time distortion to future pace the customer to have already experienced Future Success in their mind.

Let's assume that we are meeting face to face and you have asked me about my product, \"Advanced Language Patterns Mastery\" First we deepen the state of Curiosity Thank you so much for asking. You know, John, isn't it interesting how people think? I find it so amazing that so many of my customers tell me that when you first learn about Advanced Language Patterns, you become so curious about it that you want to learn how you can use it in your life. And it is so natural. It's like, have you ever had a time in your life when you notice that there is something happening and you just begin to wonder about it. And no matter what you are doing, whether it's during the day or during the night, it keeps popping into your mind and that makes you even more curious about it.
