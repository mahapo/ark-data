I especially thank Richard Bandler whose genius continues to develop new and e ffective concepts, techniques, patterns, and distinctions that have made NLP even more powerful. I also want to give credit and recognition to the many other NLP trainers and authors whose work has influenced my life and the way that I have integrated and interpreted the material that appears in this workshop manual. I have drawn from the work and ideas expressed by Steve and Connirae Andreas, Robert Dilts, Tad James, Walt Woodsmall, the late Milton H. Erickson M.D., Donald Moine, John Herd, Kenneth Lloyd and Kendrick Cleveland. I owe special appreciation to Gordon Sherley, The Sherlco Corporation, who has provided me with what I strongly believe to be one of the best Practitioner and Master Practitioners training available today. I also want to thank the many Solution Focus and Brief Therapy authors from whom I have learned a so much. They include: Bill O'Hanlon, James Wilk, Steve de Shazer, Insoo Kim Berg, Paul Watzlawick, Steven Gilligan, John Weakland, John Walter and Jane Peller. I wish also to thank the participants of my workshops for their feedback on and refinement of this workshop material. Last but not least, I thank my wife, Joan, for her support and encouragement while I assembled this workshop material and my son, Robb, for his many hours of proofreading, which greatly improved this manual."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Preface To the Second Edition My purpose of putting together the material for this workshop is to provide, in one source, the majority of the hypnotic and NLP language patterns that have been codified to date. I have presupposed that the majority of the people using this manual will have some basic training and therefore have not attempted to duplicate what others have so ably provided already in the NLP literature. Those who do not have this background w ill still find the powerful ideas and techniques included here extremely useful although it will require some personal reading and self study or NLP training to take full advantage of it. I have not developed new patterns here, but rather I have collected together the existing patterns and provided my interpretation and examples of how these patterns can be used. I have done so in a way that will allow participants of my workshops and users of this workbook to enhance their professional and communication s kills. As I state in the introduction, \"One of the surest and quickest ways to improve your professional and communication skill is to increase your knowledge and skill in the use of language and language patterns.\" It has worked for me and many others an d I know it will work for you. Good luck and enjoy your journey on the way to greater skills in the use of language.

Whether you want to increase your language ability to improve your daily relationshi ps, increase your success with interventions, be more persuasive and influential in your occupation or just increase your everyday effectiveness; you can and will have to do it through the use of language. It does not matter what you want to accomplish or avoid today; it is likely that you will use language in accomplishing it. So, no matter what you want to achieve or avoid, learning and making the language patterns, outlined in this workshop, available both at a conscious and an unconscious level will he lp you immensely. In fact, you may begin to make extensive changes through the use of only language patterns. One side effect you will notice is that you will automatically begin to hear and change the language that has been limiting you and begin to use language to create new possibilities in all areas of your life. Language patterns are one of the most pervasively useful areas of communication, because anytime you are speaking - the words you are saying, and how you say them, makes a tremendous differen ce. You will find that as you consciously incorporate the language patterns in this workshop into your daily life you will be able to make changes in all areas of your life. Being in the business world, I have found language and language patterns extremel y useful. There is one caution, I wish to address: when you use these powerful techniques, in business or other areas, you must keep in mind that both/all parties must benefit. Being concerned only about what you want and not what the other person wants is a sure way to end what could be a long - term relationship. Anytime you are talking to someone, including yourself; it is relevant what words you use. Use language patterns to move yourself and others in a direction that results in a win - in situation."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"La nguage is Much More Than Just Words Please remember that language patterns are not only auditory they are also visual and kinesthetic. We really are talking about a full verbal and nonverbal experience. As we move our own experiences in the direction we w ant to move, we can notice how what we say and do matches the experience we want to have and make whatever changes are necessary to positively affect ourselves and others. Intonation Patterns Language patterns are made more effective through the use of t otal communication: both verbal and nonverbal. Studies show that communication is made up of 7% word content, 38% voice intonation (tone, tempo, speed, and timbre) and 55% physiological gestures. Therefore, the proper use of language patterns requires not only that the word syntax be perfect but that the language patterns be spoken with the appropriate nonverbal gestures and analog marking (marking some of the words in the communication by tonal shifts, tempo shift, body shifts, small gestures, spatial loca tion, etc.). The following diagram shows the intonation patterns of a question, statement, and command. Word = question Word -------- Word Word -------- Word Word = statement Word -------- Word Word = command One of the easiest ways to und erstand the use of intonation is through the practice and use of tag questions. Tag questions are questions that are used to turn the uncertainty of a question into the certainty of a statement or a command. Tag questions use word like: can you not?, isn't it?, hasn't it?, wasn't it?, aren't you?, aren't they?, can't you?, couldn't you?, doesn't it? don't you agree?, don't we?, shouldn't it?, wouldn't it?, won't it?, hasn't it?, isn't that right?, didn't it?, can you not think that? We use tag questions to invite people to share our certainty by using an intonation of a command or a statement."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"EXERCISE: Practice making each of these statements a question, a statement, and a command through the use of intonation patterns.

Tense may denote time as present, time as completed actions, time as continuous action. J ust as there are divisions of time; past, present, and future, there is verb tenses of past, present and future. Verb tenses change our subjective experience. Notice how your subjective experience changes with the following verb tense changes. 1. I talke d to him. (past) 2. I talk to him. (present) 3. I will talk to him. (future) Notice how your experience changes with the present participle \"talking\", in each of the three verb forms. 4. I was talking to him. 5. I am talking to him. 6. I will be talkin g to him. Notice how your experience changes with the following three perfect verb forms: 7. I had talked to him. (past perfect) The past perfect tense indicates action or condition as perfected or completed at some definite past time, usually in relati on to some past act. Two past acts are, therefore, indicated, one being \"past past\" or more past than the other. 8. I have talked to him. (present perfect) The present perfect tense indicates action of condition as completed or perfected in the present o r having started in the past and continuing only to the present. 9. I will have talked to him. (future perfect) The future perfect tense indicates action or condition as perfected or completed at some specified future time or as taking place before some other future action. Two future acts are therefore indicated, one being further into the future than the other."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"USING VERB TENSES 1. Verb tense can be used for putting a present problem into the past by using the past tense and a tag question. \"That has been a problem, hasn't it?\" \"That was something you did, wasn't it?\" 2. Verb tense can be used for putting a present problem into the completed past by starting a sentence with a present tense and moving to a past tense with a tag question. \"That i s a problem, wasn't it?\" \"You want to solve this problem, didn't you?\" 3. Verb tense can be used to reorient a new behavior into the future, transform it into the present, and then look back on the problem behavior, or look back at yourself having made t he change. \"What would it be like when you have made those changes now, in the future, as you look back and see what it was like to have had that problem.... as you think about that now?\" - (R. Bandler) 4. Use verb tenses to put problems in the past and to bring forward resources from the past, present or future. \"So, up until now, you have lost your temper and now you know that you can control it and will do just that, if some little thing bothers you in the future, isn't that right.\" Notes: __________ ____________________________________________________________________ _ ______________________________________________________________________________ _ ______________________________________________________________________________ _ _______________________ _______________________________________________________ _ ______________________________________________________________________________ _ ______________________________________________________________________________ _ ____________________________________ __________________________________________ _ ______________________________________________________________________________ _"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"______________________________________________________________________________ _"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Past, Present and Future The person talking is in the present. 1.

They are what must already be assumed to be true for the statement be ing made to be true or make sense. Presuppositions are what must be assumed rather than what is directly stated. Whenever we are communicating we use presuppositions that assume something is already true; every sentence we speak in our everyday life has p resuppositions in it. In the majority of cases we tend not to consciously recognize what we have presupposed, and concentrate on what is directly stated. Thus, the presuppositions are unconsciously accepted as being true and the listener will act as if the y were true. Sometimes we presuppose what we want but a large part of the time we presuppose what we do not want. We can greatly increase the results we get by consciously presupposing what we want and avoiding presupposing what we do not want. For exampl e, we can presuppose that changes can be made quickly and automatically or that changes will be slow and painful. In NLP we always prefer to presuppose the former change process. The following words and phrases presuppose that something happens automatica lly or unconsciously: automatically second nature constantly continuously steadily involuntarily spontaneously instinctively unconsciously even without thinking almost magically We can also presuppose that something is true, actual or factual. actual, a ctually real, really factual absolute true, truly proven genuine obviously authentic self evident fact, factual unquestionable unimpeachable certified verified"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"valid substantiated positively clearly certainly definite sure thing undeniably irrefutable In working through this workbook it will be helpful to choose specific context or themes to use in all the exercises.

Great commun icators know how to use this to their advantage. You may already have noticed that people who understand and use presuppositions are more effective that those who do not use them. It is likely this fact that makes Richard Bandler as powerful a communicator as he is. What we can learn from this is the more we understand, practice and use presuppositions, including verb tense shifts, the better our results will be. And we are interested in achieving OUTSTANDING results, are we not? Are you happy with your pr esent understanding of language patterns? If you are not, the first step you need to take is to take each language pattern and practice it over and over until it happens at an unconscious level. The more you practice the more success you will have had. I d on't know what gets you as many results as practicing does. When you have repeatedly completed what I have suggested, you will know exactly what I mean. We are not just talking about improving your language skills we are talking about totally changing your effectiveness in everything that you do.

You may already be aware of how quickly this transformation h as taken place. Fortunately, learning to use language patterns is remarkably easy. It is surprising how many people say, If you had used language patterns well, you could have achieved even better results\" and yet so few take the time to do that. If you sh ould not believe that, I would be surprised. When you begin to use presuppositions, then you will be a much better communicator. When could be a better time to begin extra practice than right now? Are you not already doing just that? If you are or if you are not, who is to say whether that is appropriate or not? I wonder if you are not already more proficient than you know you are? John Grinder always said we know much more than we think we know, you know. In fact he actually emphasized unconscious learnin g over conscious learning. Other people who have studied with Milton Erickson say the same thing.

In NLP this is referred to as representation systems or modali ties; visual (see), auditory (hear), kinesthetic (feel), olfactory (smell), and gustatory (taste). Later, Richard Bandler discovered that the meaning of a subjective experience was directly related to submodalities. Submodalities are the different componen ts of modalities or representation systems. For example, in the visual modality the component elements include: whether the picture is black and white or color, how close the image is, the brightness, the location of the picture, the size, the contrast, th e focus etc.. See the bibliography for books containing a more complete explanation of submodalities and how they are used to change subjective experience. The principle is that if a person varies some of the submodalities, their experience will also chan ge. For example, a generalization for most people is that as the person makes the visual image closer and brighter, the intensity of the feeling about the imagined situation increases. Changing some submodalities, called drivers, will make major changes in experience. Changing other submodalities will have very little or no effect. Which submodalities make major changes and which do not varies with each individual. Therefore, each individual must be \"calibrated\" to find the driving submodalities. The next section of the workshop, provides language that may be used and \"calibrated\" to determine what changes are created in another's (or your own) subjective experience. The following language shifts the submodalities of space: above all, that aside, from, o f bottom across back, to, of bring together add more become panoramic clear, of, out against behind, all close down along side below, all, that closer along, with beside come up to amidst, among between compress apart, from, of beyond condense around big ger continue forward ascending blow over cramp"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" disappear, from, to in place of past dissolve increase peak distance indistinguishable pick up double, up inside, that, of pop up down, to instead of putting aside draw in into rear drop keep abreast reduc e, in size, the size duplicate keep away remote dwindle keep going forward repeat, that expand your horizons keep off replace, that extend leave it and go on run over fade away lessen set at rest fall off let everything drop shrink it down flicker, off, o ut lookout over shrivel it up from above make absent side by side from behind middle smaller from beneath missing somewhere to the side from between move forward split front move right ahead spread out get clear on to stop go back open up stretch go behin d opposite, to, of terminal point go by out of reach terminate go over top of out of the way too big gone by out, of, to turn inside out half, halfway outside of turn into halt overlap horizontal overcome identical overhead immense overlay Examples of Usi ng Presuppositions of Space: As you look at that, now, and begin to rise above all that, how is it automatically different from before?

Some people think in terms of the \"big picture\" or very abstract ideas and thoughts while others prefer to think in \"concrete terms\" and pay attention to details and specifics. Being able to recognize the level of abstraction where other s are talking and being able to match or pace that level of abstraction will result in improved communication. After reaching agreement on that level of abstraction, mutual outcomes can then be achieved by leading the conversation laterally, to the more co ncrete or by staying at the present level. Communication may continue to move quickly from the abstract to the concrete or from the concrete to the abstract. However, recognizing and utilizing the level of abstraction on which the conversation is taking p lace will greatly improve communication. The Milton Model or hypnotic language, which is addressed in this workshop, moves the conversation towards the abstract. The Meta Model, also covered in this workshop, moves the conversation towards the more specifi c or concrete. One way to use the levels of abstraction is to move to the more abstract to obtain agreement among parties and then gradually move down to more specifics once agreement has been reached. Some people actually will not require that more concr ete details be provided because they are comfortable with the ambiguity. Other people will require great detail. Therefore, reach agreement on the larger abstract idea and then provide only the details required.

Reframing will make additional alternatives available to them and give them more flexibility. • An external event or sensory experience elicits a response to which a meaning is attached. • Reframing is the ability to attach a new meaning to an external event or sensory experience which in turn causes a new response to it. • All meaning is context dependent. • If the context or frame is changed then the meaning and t he response to the meaning will change. • People tend to attach only one meaning to each sensory experience. • Different people can attach different meanings to the very same external event or sensory experience. • Every sensory experience in the world and every behavior is appropriate in some context or frame. • As a communicator you have the ability to shift the meaning or frame people put around something/anything. • Broadening a person's view through reframing doesn't actually make them do anything else. It will only allow them to consider making a change 1) if the new view makes more sense to them than what they have been thinking and 2) if it is an undeniably valid way of looking at the world. • Thinking about something in many different ways is an important part of understanding. • Specific content must be known in order to make a reframe. • Sequencing and delivery are important, therefore the reframer needs to find a way to reframe and deliver the reframe with impact. • The reframer must be congruent in nonverbal analo gs (words and all nonverbal communication match) when delivering a reframe in order to have the reframe be considered. • After delivering the reframe, the reframer must observe sensory based nonverbal changes that occur in the person, as the person's experie nce changes to the behavior, or the reframe has not been effective. • A reframe must change the response to the sensory experience or it is not an appropriate reframe. • An external event elicits a response to which a meaning is attached. A reframe essentially says that if you looked at it this way then you would have a different response."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE MEANING REFRAME When people have a sensory experience that they do not like, it is not the experience they do not like, but their actual response to it. It is important to understand that the response itself is not based on what is happening (in sensory experience) but rather to the meaning that has been attached to it. What can be done is to reframe or change the meaning of the experience that will then change the respo nse to that experience. Meaning reframing is used when the \"problem\" behavior is appropriate but the meaning attached to it may be limiting (i.e. there is nothing actually inherently bad about the \"problem\") Leave the content the same and change the mean ing of the behavior in that same context. A equals B, A is B, or A means B - - - - requires a meaning reframe How To Do A Meaning Reframe 1) Listen for the linguistic form of A equals B, A is B or A means B. 2) Ask yourself: • Is there a different or la rger frame in which this behavior would be of value? • What other aspects of this situation that do not appear obvious to the person could provide a different meaning? • What else could this behavior mean? • How else could I describe this situation? 3) Think of the reframe. 4) Deliver the reframe congruently and observe sensory based nonverbal changes that occur in the person as their experience changes. EXAMPLES: Statement: Keeping the same management means that it will be impossible to transform the company . Reframe: I thought that way too until I saw what the average person could do to bring down the Berlin wall or change Russia forever. Even though I believe that management is developing the skills needed to change, the employees have the critical mass to make the change, if you start now."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE CONTEXT REFRAME A context reframe leaves the meaning of an experience the same and shows how it is a proper response in another context. A context reframe is used on an experience that appears as a comparative g eneralization about oneself or someone else and has deleted the context Examples are: \"I am too X.\" or \"He is too X.\" \"(Subject) is too \", I am too X.\" ---- requires a context reframe HOW TO DO A CONTEXT REFRAME 1) Listen for the linguistic form of \"I am too X.\" or \"(Subject) is too X.\" 2) Ask yourself: • In what context would this particular behavior be of value? • (Think of different contexts until you find one that changes the evaluation of the behavior.) 3) Think of the reframe. 4) Deliver the re frame congruently and observe sensory based nonverbal changes that occur in the person as their experience changes. EXAMPLES: Statement: The company is too slow in deciding whom to keep and whom to lay off Ref rame: You know I'm really glad that when it comes time for them to consider you and I that they will take all the time they need to make the right decision, aren't you?

People generalize, distort, and delete information from what they say. The Meta Model allows us to recover information that was not stated. How the Meta Model is used to determine how a person deletes, distorts, and builds generalizations which result in behaviors and how this information can be used to make lasting changes is beyond the scope of this manual. The following table is provided to allow the user to recover information that was generalized, distorted, and deleted. Because every sentence has these generalizations, distortions, and deletions, use the Meta Model only when the response/cha llenge will recover information for a specific purpose.

Now, I'm going to ask you to begin to make your learnings even more permanent. You are able to do this by taking the time each day to notice the different patterns and to practice using one or two o f them in your area of interest. It is only in this way that you can truly master and benefit to the fullest from what you already have and are going to learn from this workshop. I By continually practicing the different patterns, you will internalize th em so that you can use them in an unconscious manner. You will find yourself responding to objections, reframing limitations and bringing forward resources in ways you have not dreamed of. And it only takes a little practice every day. Thank you for putti ng your energy into this workshop. I look forward to hearing from you about your success in applying this material. Good luck in your continued use of this material.
