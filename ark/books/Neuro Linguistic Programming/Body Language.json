"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Introduction When I first heard about ‘body language’ at a seminar in 1971, I became so excited about it that I wanted to learn more. The sp eaker told us about some of the research done by Professor Ray Birdwhistell at the Un iversity of Louisville, which had shown that more human communication took place by the use of gestures, postures, position and distances than by any other method. At th at time I had been a commission salesman for several years and had undergone many long, intensive courses on selling techniques, but none of these courses had ever mentione d anything about the non-verbal aspects or implications of face-to-face encounters. My own investigations showed that little useful info rmation was available on body language and, although libraries and universitie s had records of th e studies done on it, most of this information consisted of closely set manuscripts and theoretical assumptions compiled in an objective manner by people who had little or no practical experience in dealing with other human beings . This does not mean that their work was not important; simply that most of it was too technical to have any practical application or use by a layman like myself. In writing this book, I have summarise d many of the studies by the leading behavioural scientists and have combined them with similar research done by people in other professions - sociology, anthropology, zoology, education, psychiatry, family counseling, professional ne gotiating and selling. The book also includes many ‘how to’ feat ures developed from the countless reels of videotape and film made by myself and others throughout Austra lasia and overseas, plus some of the experiences and encounters that I have had with the thousands of people that I have interviewed, recruited, tr ained, managed and sold to over the past fifteen years. This book is by no means the last word on body language, nor does it contain any of the magic formulae promised by some of the books in the bookstores. Its purpose is to make the reader more aware of his own nonve rbal cues and signals and to demonstrate how people communicate with each other using this medium. This book isolates and examines each component of body language and gesture, though few gestures are made in isolation from others; I have at the same time tried to avoid oversimplifying. Non-verbal communi cation is, however, a complex process involving people, words, tone of voice and body movements. There will always be those who throw up their hands in horror and claim that the study of body language is just another mean s by which scientific knowledge can be used to exploit or dominate others by read ing their secrets or thoughts. This book seeks to give the reader greater insight into comm unication with his fellow humans, so that he may have a deeper understa nding of other people and, therefore, of himself. Understanding how something works makes li ving with it easier, whereas lack of understanding and ignorance prom ote fear and superstition a nd make us more critical of others. A birdwatcher does not study birds so that he can shoot them down and keep them as trophies. In the same way, the acquisition of knowledge and skills in non-verbal communication serves to make every encounter with another person an exciting experience."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"This book was originally intended as a working manual for sales people, sales managers and executives and, in the ten years that it has taken to research and compile, it has been expanded in such a way that any pe rson, regardless of hi s or her vocation or position in life, can use it to obtain a better understanding of life’s most complex event – a face-to-face encounter with another person. ALLAN PEASE "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"One A Framework for Understanding As we approach the end of the twentiet h century, we are witnessing the emergence of a new kind of social scien tist-the non-verbalist. Just as the birdwatcher delights in watching birds and their behaviour, so th e non-verbalist delights in watching the non-verbal cues and signals of human beings. He watches them at social functions, at beaches, on television, at the office or anywhere that people interact . He is a student of behaviour who wants to learn about the actions of his fello w humans so that he may ultimately learn more about himself and how he can improve his relationships with others. It seems almost incredible that, over the million or more years of man’s evolution, the non-verbal aspects of communication have been actively studied on any scale only since the 1960s and that th e public has become aware of their existence only since Julius Fast published a book about body la nguage in 1970. This was a summary of the work done by behavioural scientists on nonverbal communication up until that time, and even today, most people are still ignor ant of the existen ce of body language, let alone its importance in their lives. Charlie Chaplin and many other silent movi e actors were the pioneers of non-verbal communication skills; they were the only means of communication available on the screen. Each actor was classed as good or bad by the extent to which he could use gestures and other body signals to comm unicate effectively. When talking films became popular and less emphasis was placed on the non-verbal aspects of acting, many silent movie actors faded into obscu rity and those with good verbal skills prevailed. As far as the technical study of body langua ge goes, perhaps the most influential pre-twentieth-century work was Charles Darw in’s The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals published in 1872. This spawne d the modern studies of facial expres- sions and body language and many of Darwin’s ideas and observations have since been validated by modern researchers around the world. Since that time, researchers have noted and recorded almost one million nonverb al cues and signals. Albert Mehrabian found that the total impact of a message is about 7 per cent verbal (words only) and 38 per cent vocal (including tone of voice, inflection and other sounds) and 55 per cent non-verbal. Professor Birdwhistell made so me similar estimates of the amount of non-verbal communication that takes place amongst humans. He estimated that the average person actually speaks wo rds for a total of about ten or eleven minutes a day and that the average sentence takes only a bout 2.5 seconds. Like Mehrabian, he found that the verbal component of a face-to-face conversation is less than 35 per cent and that over 65 per cent of communica tion is done non-verbally. Most researchers generally agree that th e verbal channel is used primarily for conveying information, while the non-verbal channel is used for negotiating interpersonal attitudes, and in some cases is used as a substitute for verbal messages. For example, a woman can give a man a ‘l ook to kill’; she will convey a very clear message to him wit hout opening her mouth."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Regardless of culture, words and m ovements occur together with such predictability that Birdwhistell says that a well-trained person should be able to tell what movement a man is making by listening to his voice. In like manner, Birdwhistell learned how to tell what language a pe rson was speaking, simply by watching his gestures. Many people find difficulty in accepting that humans are still biologically animals. Homo sapiens is a species of primate, a ha irless ape that has learned to walk on two limbs and has a clever, advanced brain. Like any other species, we are dominated by biological rules that control our actions, reactions, body language and gestures. The fascinating thing is that the human animal is rarely aware of hi s postures, movements and gestures that can tell one story while his voice may be telling another. PERCEPTIVENESS, INTUITION AND HUNCHES From a technical point of view, when ever we call someone ‘perceptive’ or ‘intuitive’, we are referring to his or her ability to read anot her person’s non-verbal cues and to compare these cues with verbal signals. In other words, when we say that we have a ‘hunch’ or ‘gut feeling’ that someone ha s told us a lie, we re ally mean that their body language and their spoken words do not agr ee. This is also what speakers call audience awareness, or rela ting to a group. For example, if the audience were sitting back in their seats with chins down and ar ms crossed on their chest, a ‘perceptive’ speaker would get a hunch or feeling that hi s delivery was not goi ng across. He would become aware that he needed to take a diffe rent approach to gain audience involvement. Likewise, a speaker who was not ‘per ceptive’ would blunder on regardless. Women are generally more percep tive than men, and this fa ct has given rise to what is commonly referred to as ‘women’s intuiti on’. Women have an inna te ability to pick up and decipher non-verbal signa ls, as well as having an accu rate eye for small details. This is why few husbands can lie to their wives and get away with it and why, conversely, most women can pull the wool over a man’s eyes without his realising it. This female intuition is particularly evident in women who have brought up young children. For the first few years, the mother relies solely on the non-verbal channel to communicate with the child and this is beli eved to be the reason why women often become more perceptive negotiators than men. INBORN, GENETIC, LEARNE D AND CULTURAL SIGNALS Much research and debate ha s been done to discover wh ether non-verbal signals are inborn, learned, genetically transferred or acquired in some other way. Evidence was collected from observation of blind and/or deaf people who could not have learned non- verbal signals through the auditory or visual channels, from observing the gestural be- haviour of many different cultures around th e world and from studying the behaviour of our nearest anthropological rela tives, the apes and monkeys. The conclusions of this research indicate th at some gestures fall into each category. For example, most primate children are born with the immediate ability to suck, indicating that this is either inborn or ge netic. The German scientist Eibl-Eibesfeldt found that the smiling expressions of childre n born deaf and blind occur independently of learning or copying, which means that thes e must also be inborn gestures. Ekman, Friesen and Sorenson supporte d some of Darwin’s orig inal beliefs about inborn gestures when they studied th e facial expressions of people from five widely different"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"cultu res. Th ey found that each cu lture used th e sam e basic facial gestures to show em otion, which led them to the conclusion that these gestures must be inborn. When you c r oss your arm s on your chest, do you cross left over right or right over left? Most people cannot confidently describe which way they do this until they try it. Where one way feels comfortable, the othe r feels com p letely wrong. Evidence suggests that this m a y well be a genetic gesture that cannot be changed. Debate still exists as to whether so m e ge stures are cultura l ly lea r ned a nd become habitual, o r are g e netic. For exam ple, m o st m e n put on a coat right arm first; m o s t wom e n put it on left arm firs t. W h en a m a n pa sses a woman in a crowded street, he usually turns his body towards her as he passe s; she usually turns her body away from him . Does she instinctiv ely do th is to prot e c t h e r brea sts ? Is this an in born f e m a le reaction or has she learned to do this by unconsciously watching other females? Much of our basic non-verbal behaviour is learned and the m eaning of m a ny move m e nts and gestures is cu lturally determ ined. Let us now look at these aspects of body language. SOME BASICS A ND THEIR ORIGINS Most of the basic communication gestures are th e sam e all over the world. W h en people are happy they sm ile; when they are sa d or angry they frown or scowl. Nodding the head is alm o st universally used to indicate ‘yes’ or affirm ation. It appears to be a for m of hea d lowering and is probably an inbor n gesture, as it is also used by deaf and blind people. Shaking the head from side to side to indica te ‘no’ or negation is also universal and m a y well be a gesture that is learned in infancy. W h en a baby has had enough m ilk, he turns his head from s i de to si de to reject his mother’s breast. W h en the young child has had enough to eat, he shakes his head from side to side to stop his parent’s attempt to spoon feed hi m and in th is way he quickly learns to use the head shaking gesture to show disagreem ent or a negative attitude. The evolutionary origin of som e gestures can be trac ed to our prim itive anim al past. Baring the teeth is derived from the act of atta cking an d is still used by m odern m a n in the f o rm of a sneer and other suc h hostile gestures, even though he will not attack with his teeth. Sm iling wa s orig ina lly a threa t gesture, but today it is done in conjunction with non-threatening gestures to show pleasure. The shoulder shrug is also a good example of a universal gesture that is used to show that a person does not kno w or understand what you are talk ing about. It is a m u ltiple gesture that has three m a in parts: exposed palm s, hunched shoulders and raised brow. Just as verbal language diffe rs from culture to culture, so the non-verbal language m a y also differ. W h ereas one gesture m a y be common in a particu l ar culture and have a clear interpretation, it may be m eaningless in another culture or even have a com p letely"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"opposite m eaning. Take, for exam pl e, the cultu ral interpretations a nd implications of three common hand gestures, the ring gesture, the thum b-up and V sign. The Ring or ‘OK’ Gesture This gesture was popularised in the USA during the early nineteenth century, apparen t ly by the newspapers that, at the tim e, were startin g a craze of using initials to shorten common phrases. There’ are m a ny differ ent views ab out what th e initia ls ‘OK’ stand for, som e believing it stood for ‘all correct’ which m a y have been m i sspelled as ‘oll korrect’, while others say that it m eans the opposite of ‘knoc k-out’ that is, K.O. Another popular theory is th at it is an abbreviation of ‘Old Kinderhook’, from the birthp lace o f a nineteenth century Am eri can presiden t who used the initials as a cam paign slogan. W h ich theory is the correct one we m a y never know, but it seem s that the ring its elf rep r esen ts th e letter ‘O’ in the ‘OK’ signal. Th e - ,’O K ’ m eaning is common to all English-speaking countries a nd, although its m eaning is fast spreading across Euro pe and Asia, it has other orig ins and m eanings in certain places. F o r exam ple, in France it als o m eans ‘zero’ or ‘nothing’; in Japan it can m e a n ‘m oney’; in som e Mediterran ean co untries it is an orific e s i gnal, of ten used to inf e r tha t a m a n is hom o sexual. For overse a s trave lle rs, the safest ru le to obey is, ‘W hen in Rom e , do as the Rom a ns do’. This can help avoid any possible em barrassing circum stances. The Thumb-Up Gesture In Britain, Australia and New Zealan d th e thum b-up gesture ha s th ree m e anings; it is commonly used by hitch-hikers who are t humbing a lift, it is an OK signal, and when the thum b is jerked sharply upwards it beco m e s an insult signal, m eaning ‘up yours’ or ‘sit on this’. In som e countries, such as Greece, its m a in m eaning is ‘get stuffed’, so you can im agine the dilemm a of the Australian hitc h-hiker using this gest ure in that country! When Italians count from one to five, they use this gesture to m ean ‘one’ and the inde x finger then becom e s ‘two’, whereas m o st Au stralians, Americans and English people count ‘one’ on the index finger and two on the middle finger. In th is case the thum b will represent the num ber ‘five’."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The thum b is also used, in com b inati on with other gestures, as a power and superiority signal or in situations where peopl e try to get us ‘under their thumb’. A later chapter takes a closer lo ok at the u s e of the thumb in these particular contexts. The V Sign This sign is popular throughout Australia, New Zealand an d Great Brita in and carries an ‘up yours’ interpretation. W i nston Churchill popularised the V for victory sign during W o r l d W a r II, but his two-fingered version was done with the palm facing out, whereas the palm f a c e s t o w a r d s t h e speaker for the obsce n e i n s u l t version. In most parts of Europe, however, the palm facing in version s t ill m eans ‘victory’ so that an Eng l ishm an who uses it to tell a European to ‘get stuffed’ could leave the European wondering about wh at victory the Englishm an m eant. This signal also m eans the num ber two in m a ny part s of Europe, and if the insulted European were a bartender, his response could be to give an Englishman or an Australian two mugs of bee r . These examples show that cultural m i sinterpretation of gestures can produce em bar r assing results and that a pers on’s cultural background should always be considered before jum p ing to conclusions about his or her body language or gestures. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, our discussion should be considered culturally specif i c, tha t is, gene rally per t a i nin g to adu lt, white m i ddle class p e o p le r a is ed in Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Nort h America and other places where English is the prim ary language. GESTURE CLUS TE RS One of the most serious m i stakes a novice in body language can m a ke is to interpret a solita ry ge sture in isolati on of other gestures or othe r circum stances. For exam ple, scratch i ng the head can m ean a number of th ings -dandruff, fl eas, sweating, uncertainty, forgetfulness or lying, dependi ng on the other gestures that o ccur at the s a m e tim e, so we m u st always look at gesture clusters for a correct reading. Like any other language, body language co nsists of words, sentences and punctuation. Each gesture is like a single wo rd and a word may have several different m eanings. It is only when you put the word into a sentence with other words that you can fully understand its m eaning. Gestures come in ‘sentences’ and invariably tell the truth about a person’s feelings or attitudes. The ‘percep tive’ person is one who can read the non-verbal sentences and accurately m a tch them against the person’s verbal sentences."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Figure 5 shows a common critical evaluation gesture cluster. The m a in one is the hand-to-face gesture, with the index finge r pointing up the cheek while another finger covers the mouth and the thum b supports the ch in . Further ev idence tha t th is listene r is critical of th e speaker is seen by th e fact tha t the legs a r e tig h tly c r ossed and the a r m crosses the body (defe n sive) while the head and chin are down (hostility). This non-verbal ‘sentence’ says som e thing like, ‘I don’t like what you are saying and I disagree with you.’ Congruence If you, as the speaker, were to ask the listener sh own in Figure 5 to give his opinion of what you have just said and he said that he disagreed with you, his non-verbal signals would be congruent with his verbal sent ences, that is, they would m a tch or be consistent. If, however, he said he was enjo ying what you had to say, he would be lying because his words and gestures would be in congruent. Research shows that non-verbal signals carry about five tim e s as m u c h im pact as the ve rbal channel and that, when the two are incongruent, people rely on the non-ve rbal m e ssage; the verb al content m a y be disregarded. We often see a high ranking politician stan ding behind a lect ern with his arms tightly folded acros s his chest (defensive) and chin down (critical or hostile), while telling his audience how recep tive an d open he is to the ideas of young people. He m a y attem p t to convince the audien ce of his warm , hum a ne a pproach while giving short, sharp karate chops to the lectern. Sigm und Freud once noted that while a patient w a s verbally expressing happiness with her m a rriage, she was un cons ciously slipping her wedding ring on and off her finge r. Freud was aware of the sign ificance of this unconscious gesture and was not surp rised when m a rriage pr oblem s began to surface. Observation of gesture clusters and c ongruence of the verbal and non-verbal channels are the keys to accurate in terpretation of body langu age."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Gestures in Context In addition to looking for gesture clus ters and congruence of speech and body movement, all gestures should be considered in the context in which they occur. If, for example, someone was sitting at a bus termin al with arms and legs tightly crossed and chin down and it was a chilly winter’s day, it would most likely mean that he or she was cold, not defensive. If, howev er, the person used the same gestures while you were sitting across a table from him trying to sell him an idea, product or service, they could be correctly interpreted as m eaning that the person was ne gative or defensive about the situation. Throughout this book all gestures will be considered in co ntext and, where possible, gesture clusters will be examined. Other Factors Affecting Interpretation A man who has a ‘dead fish’ hand shake is likely to be accused of having a weak character and the chapter on hand shake tec hniques will explore the reason for this popular theory. But if a man has arthritis in his hands, it is likely that he will use a ‘dead fish’ hand shake to avoid th e pain of a strong one. Sim ilarly, artists, musicians, surgeons and those in vocatio ns whose work is delicate a nd involves use of their hands generally prefer not to shake hands, but, if they are forced to do so, they may use a ‘dead fish’ to protect them. Someone who wears ill-fitti ng or tight clothing may be unable to use certain gestures, and this can affect use of body la nguage. This applies to a minority of people, but it is important to consider what effect a person’s physical restric tions or disabilities may have on his or her body movement. Status and Power Research in the field of linguistics has shown that there is a direct relationship between the amount of status , power or prestige a person commands and that person’s range of vocabulary. In other words, the hi gher up the social or management ladder a person is, the better able he is to comm unicate in words and phrases. Non-verbal research has revealed a correlation between a person’s command of the spoken word and the amount of gesticulation that that person uses to communicate his or her message. This means that a person’s status, power or prestige is also directly related to the number of gestures or body movements he uses. The person at the top end of the social or management scale can use his range of words to communicate his meaning, whereas the less educated or unskilled person will rely more on gestures than words to communicate. Throughout this book, most of the examples given refer to white, middle-class people but, as a general rule the higher the person on the socio-economic scale, the less gesticulation and body movement he uses. The speed of some gestures and how obvious they look to others is also related to the age of the individual. For example, if a five-year-old child tells a lie to his or her parent, the mouth will be de liberately covered with on e or both hands immediately afterwards (Figure 6). The gesture of covering the mouth alerts the parent to the lie and this gesture continues to be used throughout the individual’s lifetime, usually varying only in the speed at which it is done. When the teenager tell s a lie, the hand is brought to"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the m outh li ke that of a five-year-old, but instead of the obvious hand slapping gesture over the m outh, the fingers rub lightly around it (Figure 7). This m outh-covering gesture becomes even m o re refined in adulthood. When the adult tells a lie, his b r ain inst ructs his hand to cover his m outh in an attem p t to block the deceitful wo rds, just as it does for the five-year-old and th e teenager, bu t at the las t mom e nt the hand is pulled away from the f ace and a nose touch gesture res u lts (F igure 8). This gesture is nothing m o re than th e adult’s sophisticat ed version of the mouth-covering gesture that was used in chil dhood. This is an exam ple of the fact that, as an individual gets older, m a ny of his gestures becom e sophisticated and less obvious, which is wh y it is of ten more dif f i cult to re ad the gestures of a fifty year-old than tho s e of a m u ch younger person. FAKING BODY LANGUAGE A commonly asked question is, ‘Is it pos sible to fake your own body language? ’ The general answer to this que stion is ‘no’ because of the lack of cong ruence that is likely to occur in the use of the m a in ge stures, the body’s m i cros ignals and the spoken"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"words. For example, open palms are associat ed with honesty but when the faker holds his palms out and smiles at you as he tells a lie, his microgestures give him away. His pupils may contract, one eyebrow may lift or the comer of his mouth may twitch, and these signals contradict the open palm gesture and the sincere smile. The result is that the receiver tends not to believe what he hears. The human mind seems to possess a fail-safe m echanism that registers ‘tilt’ when it receives a series of incongruent non-verbal messages. There are, however, some cases in which body language is deliberately fake d to gain certain advantages. Take, for example, the Miss World or Miss Universe co ntest, in which each contestant uses studiously learned body movements to give th e impression of warmth and sincerity. To the extent that each contestant can convey these signals, she will score points from the judges, but even the experts can only fake body language for a short period of time and eventually the body will emit signals that are independent of conscious actions. Many politicians are experts in faking body language in order to get the voters to believe what they are saying and the politician who can successfully do this is said to have ‘charisma’. The face is used more often than any othe r part of the body to cover up lies. We use smiles, nods and winks in an attempt to cover up, but unfortunately for us, our body signals tell the truth and there is a lack of congruence between our body gestures and facial signals. The study of facial signals is an art in itself. Little space is devoted to it in this book and for more information about it I recommend Face La nguage by Robert L. Whiteside. In summary, it is difficult to fake body language for a long period of time but, as we shall discuss, it is good to learn and to use positive open gestures to communicate with others and to eliminate gestures that may gi ve negative signals. This can make it more comfortable to be with people and can make you more acceptable to them. How To Tell Lies Successfully The difficulty with lying is that the subconscious mind acts automatically and independently of our verbal lie, so our body language gives us away. This is why people who rarely tell lies are easily caught, regardless of how convincing they may sound. The moment they begin to lie, the body sends out contradictory signals, and these give us our feeling that they are not telling the truth. During the lie, the subconscious mind sends out nervous energy that appears as a gesture that can contradict what the person said. Some pe ople whose jobs involve lying, such as politicians, lawyers, actors and television announcers, have refined their body gestures to the point where it is difficult to ‘see’ the lie, and people fall for it, hook, line and sinker. They refine their gestures in one of two wa ys. First, they practise what ‘feel’ like the right gestures when they tell the lie, but this is only successful when they have practised telling numerous lies over long periods of time. Second, they can eliminate most gestures so that they do’ not use any positive or negative gestures while lying, but this is also very difficult to do. Try this simple test when an occasion pr esents itself. Tell a deliberate lie to an acquaintance and make a conscious effort to suppress all body gestures while your body is in full view of the other person. Even wh en your major body gest ures are consciously suppressed, numerous microgestures will stil l be transmitted. These include facial"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"muscular twitching, expansion and contraction of pupils, sweating at the brow, flushing of the cheeks, increased rate of eye blinki ng and numerous other minute gestures that signal deceit. Research using slow motion cameras shows that these microgestures can occur within a split second and it is only people such as professional interviewers, sales people and those whom we call perceptive who can consciously see them during a conversation or negotiation. The best intervie wers and sales people are those who have developed the unconscious ability to read the microgestures during face-to-face encounters. It is obvious, then, that to be able to lie successfully, you must have your body hidden or out of sight. This is why police interrogation involves pl acing the suspect on a chair in the open or placi ng him under lights with his body in full view of the interrogators; his lies are much easier to see under those circum stances. Naturally, telling lies is easier if you are sitting behind a desk wh ere your body is partially hidden, or while peering over a fence or behind a closed door. The best way to lie is over the telephone! HOW TO LEARN BODY LANGUAGE Set aside at least fifteen minutes a day to study and read the gestures of other people, as well as acquiring a conscious awaren ess of your own gestures. A good reading ground is anywhere that people meet and inte ract. An airport is a particularly good place for observing the entire spectrum of human gestures, aspeople openly express eagerness, anger, sorrow, happiness, impa tience and many other emotions through gestures. Social functions, business meetings and parties are also excellent. Having studied the art of body language, you can go to a party, sit alon e in a corner all evening like a wallflower and have an exciting time just watching other peop le’s body language rituals! Television also offers an excelle nt way of learning nonve rbal communication. Turn down the sound and try to understand what is happening by first watching the picture. By turning the s ound up every five minutes, you will be able to check how accurate your non-verbal readings are and be fore long it will be possible to watch an entire program without any sound and understand what is happening, just as deaf people do. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Two Territories and Zones Thousands of books and articles have b een written about th e staking out and guarding of territories by animals, birds, fi sh and primates, but only in recent years has it been discovered that man also has territories. When this is learned and the implications understood, not only can enormous insights into one’s own behaviour and that of others be gained but the face-to- face reactions of others can be predicted. American anthropologist Edward T. Hall was one of the pioneers in the study of man’s spatial needs and in the early 1960s he coined th e word ‘proxemics’ (from ‘proximity’ or nearness). His research into this fi eld has led to new understanding about our relationships with our fellow humans. Every country is a territory staked out by clearly defined bounda ries and sometimes protected by armed guards. Within each coun try are usually smaller territories in the form of states and counties. Within these are even smaller territories called cities, within which are suburbs, containing many st reets that, in themselves, represent a closed territory to those who live there. The inhabitants of each territory share an intangible allegiance to it and have been know n to turn to savagery and killing in order to protect it. A territory is also an area or space that a person claims as his ow n, as if it were an extension of his body. Each person has his own personal territory which includes the area that exists around his possessions, su ch as his home which is bounded by fences, the inside of his motor vehicle, his own bedroom or personal chair and, as Dr Hall discovered, a defined air space around his body. This chapter will deal mainly with the im plications of this air space and how people react when it is invaded. PERSONAL SPACE Most animals have a certain air space ar ound their bodies that they claim as their personal space. How far the space extends is mainly dependent on how crowded were the conditions in which the an imal was raised. A lion raised in the remote regions of Africa may have a territorial air space with a radius of fifty kilometres or more, depending on the density of the lion population in that area, and it marks its territorial boundaries by urinating or defecating around th em. On the other hand, a lion raised in captivity with other lions may have a persona l space of only several metres, the direct result of crowded conditions. Like the other animals, man has his ow n personal portable ‘air bubble’ that he carries around with him and its size is depe ndent on the density of the population in the place where he grew up. This personal zone distance is th erefore culturally determined. Where some cultures, such as the Japanese, are accustomed to crowding, others prefer the ‘wide open spaces’ and like to keep th eir distance. However, we are mainly concerned with the territorial behaviour of people raised in Western cultures. Status can also have an effect on the dist ance at which a person st ands in relation to others and this will be discussed in a later chapter."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Zone Distances The radius of the air bubble around suburban middle class white people living in Australia, New Zealand, England, North Amer ica and Canada is generally the same. It can be broken down into four distinct zone distances. 1. Intimate Zone (between 15 and 45 centimetres or 6 to 18 inches) Of all the zone distances, this is by far the most important as it is this zone that a person guards as if it were his own property. Only those who are emotionally close to that person are permitted to enter it. This in cludes lovers, parents, spouse, children, close friends and relatives. There is a sub- zone that extends up to 15 centimetres (6 inches) from the body that can be entered only during physical contact. This is the close intimate zone. 2. Personal Zone (between 46 centimetres and 1.22 metres or 18 to 48 inches) This is the distance that we stand from ot hers at cocktail parties, office parties, social functions and friendly gatherings. 3. Social Zone (between 1.22 and 3.6 metres or 4 to 12 feet) We stand at this distance from strangers , the plumber or carpenter doing repairs around our home, the postman, the local s hopkeeper, the new empl oyee at work and people whom we do not know very well. 4. Public Zone (over 3.6 metres or 12 feet) Whenever we address a large group of people, th is is the comfortable distance at which we choose to stand. Practical Applications of Zone Distances Our intimate zone is normally entered by another person for one of two reasons. First, the intruder is a clos e relative or friend, or he or she may be making sexual advances. Second, the intruder is hostile and may be about to attack. While we will tolerate strangers moving with in our personal and social zones, the intrusion of a stranger into our intimate zone causes physiolo gical changes to take place within our bodies. The heart pumps faster, adrenalin pours into the bloodstream and blood is pumped to the brain and the muscles as phys ical preparations fo r a possible fight or flight situation are made. This means that putting your arm in a fr iendly way on or around someone you have just met may result in that person’s feeling negative towards you, even though he or she may smile and appear to enjoy it so as not to offend you. If you want people to feel comfortable in your company, the golden ru le is ‘keep your distance’. The more intimate our relationship is with other people, the closer we are permitted to move within their zones. For example, a new employee may initially feel that the other staff members are cold towards him, but they are only keeping him at the social zone distance until they know him better. As he beco mes better known to the other employees, the territorial distance between him and them decreases until eventually he is permitted to move within their personal zones and, in some cases, their intimate zones."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" The distance that two people who are ki ssing keep their hips apart can tell you som e thing about the relationship that exists between them .

Whether we are in a crowded elevator, cinema or bus, people around us become non-persons - that is, they do not exist, as far as we are concerned and so we do not respond as if we were being attacked should someone inadvertently encr oach upon our intimate territory. An angry mob or group of protesters figh ting for a mutual purpose does not react in the same way as do individuals when their terr itory is invaded; in fact, something quite different occurs. As the density of the crowd increases, each individual has less personal space and takes a hostile stand, which is why, as the size of the mob increases, it becomes angrier and uglier and fighting may begin to take place. This information is used by the police, who will try to break up th e crowd so that each person can regain his own personal space and so become calmer. Only in recent years have governments and town planners given any credence to the effect that high-density housi ng projects have in depriving individuals of their personal territory. The consequences of high-density living and overcrowding were seen in a recent study of the deer population on James Island, an island about two kilometres off the coast of Maryland in Chesapeake Bay in the United States. Many of the deer were dying in large numbers, despite the fact th at at the time there was plenty of food, predators were not in evidence and infection was not present. Similar studies in earlier years with rats and rabbits revealed the sa me trend and further investigation showed that the deer had died as a result of overactive adrenal glands, resulting from the stress caused by the deprivation of each deer’s personal territory as the population increased. The adrenal glands play an important part in the regulation of growth, reproduction and the level of the body’s defences. Thus ove rpopulation caused a phys iological reaction to the stress; not other factor s such as starvati on, infection or aggression from others. In view of this it is easy to see why areas that have the high est density of human population also have the highest crime and violence rates. Police interrogators use territorial invasi on techniques to break down the resistance of criminals being questioned. They seat the criminal on an armless, fixed chair in an open area of the room and encroach into hi s intimate and close intimate zones when asking questions, remaining there until he answ ers. It often takes only a short while for this territorial harassment to break down the criminal’s resistance. Management people can use this same appr oach to extract information from sub- ordinates who may be withholding it, but a sales person would be foolish to use this type of approach when dealing with customers. Spacing Rituals When a person claims a space or an area among strangers, such as a seat at the cinema, a place at the conference table or a towel hook at the squash court, he does it in a very predictable manner. He usually looks for the widest space available between two others and claims the area in the centre. At the cinema he will choose a seat that is halfway between the end of a row and where th e nearest person is si tting. At the squash courts, he chooses the towel hook that is in the largest available space, midway between two other towels or midway between the nearest towel and the end of the towel rack. The purpose of this ritual is not to offend th e other people by bei ng either too close or too far away from them."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"At the cinem a , if you c hoose a seat m o re than halfway between the end of the row and the nearest other person, that other person m a y feel offended if you are too far away from hi m or he m a y feel intim idated if you sit too close, so the m a in purpose of this spacing r itu al is to m a intain ha rm ony.

Such things as a person’s home, office and motor car represent a terr itory, each having clearly marked boundaries in the form of walls, gates, fences and doors. Each territory may have several sub- territories. For example, in a home a woman’ s private territory ma y be her kitchen and laundry and she objects to anyone invadi ng that space when she is using it, a businessman has his favourite place at the c onference table, diners have their favourite seat in the canteen and father has his favour ite chair at home. These areas are usually marked either by leaving personal possessions on or around the area, or by frequent use of it. The canteen diner may even go so far as to carve his initials into ‘his’ place at the table and the businessman marks his -territory at the conference ta ble with such items as an ashtray, pens, books and clothing spread around his 46centimetre intimate zone border. Dr Desmond Morris noted that studie s carried out into seating positions in libraries show that leaving a book or persona l object on a library desk reserved that place for an average of seventy-seven minutes ; leaving a jacket over a chair reserved it for two hours. At home a family member might mark his or her favourite chair by leaving a personal object, such as a pipe or magazine, on or near it to show his or her claim and ownership of the space. If the head of the house asks a sales person to be seated and the sales person quite innocently sits in ‘his’ chair, the prospect ive buyer can become inadvertently agitated about this invasion of his territory and thus be put on the defensive. A simple question such as, ‘Which chair is yours?’, can avoid the negative results of making such a territorial error. Motor Vehicles Psychologists have noted that people drivi ng a motor car react in a manner that is often completely unlike their normal social behaviour as regards their territories. It seems that a motor vehicle so metimes has a magnifying effect on the size of a person’s personal space. In some cases, their territory is magnified by up to ten times the normal size, so the driver feels that he has a claim to an area of 9 to 10 me tres in front of and behind his motor car. When another driver cuts in front of him, even if no danger is involved, the driver may go through a physiolo gical change, becoming angry and even attacking the other driver. Compare this to th e situation that occurs when the same man is stepping into a lift and another person st eps in front of him, invading his personal territory. His reaction in those circumstances is normally apologetic and he allows the other man to go first; remarkab ly different from what happens when another driver cuts in front of him on the open road. For some people, the car becomes a protec tive cocoon in which they can hide from the outside world. As they drive slowly beside the kerb, al most in the gutter, they can be as big a hazard on the road as the dr iver with the expa nded personal space."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"In summary, others will invite or reject you, depending on the respect that you have for their personal space.

Many oaths are ta ken with the palm of the hand over the heart, and the palm is held in the air w h en som e body is giving evidence in a cour t of law; the Bible is held in the le f t hand and the ri ght palm held up for the m e m b e r s of the court to view. In day-to-d ay encounters, people use two basic palm positions. The first has the palm facing upwards and is ch aracteristic of the beggar as king for m oney or food. The second has the palm facing down as if it is holding down or restraining. One of the most valuable ways of disc overing whether som e one is being open and honest or no t is to look for palm displays. Jus t as a dog will expose its throat to show subm ission or surrender to the victor, so the hum an ani m al uses his or her palm s to display the s a m e attitud e or em otion.

"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"SHAKING HANDS Shaking hands is a relic of the caveman era. Whenever cavemen met, they would hold their arms in the air with their palms exposed to show that no weapons were being held or concealed. This palms-in-air gest ure became modified over the centuries and such gestures as the palm raised in the air, the palm over the heart and numerous other variations developed. The modern form of this ancient greeting ritual is the interlocking and shaking of the palms which, in most E nglish-speaking countries , is performed both on initial greeting and on departure. The hands are normally pumped five to seven times. Dominant and Submissive Handshakes Considering what has already been said about the impact of a command given in both the palm-up and palm-down positions, let us explore the relevance of these two palm positions in hand shaking. Assume that you have just met someone for the first time and you greet each other with a customary handshake. One of three basic attitudes is transmitted through the handshake. These are dominance: ‘This person is tr ying to dominate me. I’d better be cautious’, submission: ‘I can dominate this pe rson. He will do as I wish’, and equality: ‘I like this person. We will get on well together’. These attitudes are transmitted unconscious ly and, with practice and conscious application, the following hand shaking techni ques can have an immediate effect on the outcome of a face-to-face encounter with another person. The information in this chapter represents one of the few documented studies of handshake control techniques. Dominance is transmitted by turning your hand (dark shirt sleeve) so that your palm faces down in the handshake (Figure 20). Y our palm need not be facing the floor directly, but should be facing downwards in relation to the other person’s palm and this tells him that you wish to take control in the encounter that follows. Studies of fifty-four successful senior management people have rev ealed that not only di d forty-two initiate the handshake, but they also used dominant handshake control. Just as the dog shows submission by rolling on its back and exposing its throat to the victor, so the human uses the palm-up gesture to show submission to others. The reverse of the dominant handshake is to o ffer your hand with your palm facing upwards (Figure 21). This is particularly effective when you want to give the other person control or allow him to feel that he is in command of the situation. However, though the palm-up handshake can show a submissive attitude, there may be mitigating circumstances to consider. For example, a person who has arthritis in the hands will be forced to give you a limp handshake because of his condition and this makes it easy to turn his palm into, the submissive positi on. People who use their hands in their profession, such as surgeons, artis ts and musicians, may also give a limp handshake purely to protect their hands. The gestures that follow the handshake will give further clues for your assessment of that person – the submissive person will use submissive gestures and the dominant person will use more aggressive gestures. When two dominant people shake hands, a symbolic struggle takes place as each person tries to turn the other’s palm into the submissive position. The result is a vice-like hand shake with both palms remaining in the vertical position as each person transmits a feeling of respect and rapport to the other (Figur e 22). This vice-like vertical"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"palm grip is the handsh a ke that a father teach es his son when he shows him how to ‘shake hands like a m a n’. When you receive a dom i nant handshake from another person, it is not only difficult to force his palm back over into the subm issive position, but it becom e s very obvious when you do it. There is a sim p le technique for disarm ing the dom inant hand shaker that, in addition to giving you back the control, can enable you to intim idate the other person by invading his personal sp ace. To perfect this disarm am ent techniqu e y ou need to p r actise s t epp i ng forward with your left foot as you reach to shake hands (Figure 24). Next, brin g your right leg forward, moving left in front of the person and into his personal space (Figure 25). Now bring your left leg across to your right leg to complete the m a noeuvre, then shake the person’s hand.

Hand Shake Styles The palm -down thrust is certa inly the m o st aggressive handshake style as it gives the receiver little ch an ce of establishing an equal relati onship. This handshake is typical of the aggre ssive, dom inant m a le who always initia tes it, and the stif f ar m with palm facing directly downwards forces the rece iver in to the submissive pos ition because he h a s to respon d with his palm facing up. Several w a ys to counter the palm -down thrust have been developed. You can use th e s t ep-to-the-rig h t technique (Figures 23 to 25), but som e tim e s this is d i f f i cult to u s e as the initiato r’s ar m is of ten te nse and stif f to prevent su ch tactics. A si m p le m a noeuvre is to grasp the person’s hand on top and then shake it (Figure 27). W ith this approach, you becom e the dom inant party, as you not only have control of the other person’s hand, but yours is in th e superior position on top of his with your palm facing down. As this can be embarrassing to the aggresso r, we suggest that it be used with caution and discretion. The glove handshake is som e ti m e s c a lled th e politician ’s han d shake. The initiator tries to give the receiver th e im pression that he is trustw orthy and honest, but when this techniqu e is used on a person he has just m e t, it has the reverse e ffect. The receiver feels suspicious and cautious about the initiator’s inte ntions. The glove should only be used with people to whom th e initiator is well-known."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" Few greeting gestures are as uninviting as the dead fish handshake, particularly when the h a nd is co ld or clammy.

The knuckle grinder is the tradem ark of the aggressive ‘tough guy’ type. Unfortunately, there are no eff ective ways to co unter it, apart from verb al abu s e o r physical action such as a punch on the nose! Like the palm -down thrust, the stif f - arm thru st tends to be used by aggressive types and its m a in purpose is to keep you at a distance and out of the initiator ’s intim a te zone.

W ith country folk, however, there is a tendency to lean forward or even balance on one foot when delive r ing th e stif f-arm thrust.

Pulling the receiver into the in itiator’s territo ry can m ean one of two things: first, the initiator is an insecu re type who feels safe only within h i s own personal space o r second, the initiator is from a culture that has a sm all intim ate zone and he is behaving norm a lly. The intention of the double-handed handshake is to show sincerit y, trust or depth of feeling towards the receiver. Two significan t elem ents should be noticed. Firstly, the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"left hand is used to communicate th e extra f eeling that the initiator wish es to tran smit and its ex te nt is re lated to the dis t a n ce that the initiato r’s lef t hand is moved up the receiver’s right arm . The elbow g r as p, for ex am ple (F igure 35), transm its m o re feeling than the wrist hold (F igure 34), and the shoul der hold, (Figure 37) transmits m o re than the upper-arm grip (Figure 36). S econdly, th e initiator’s left hand represents an invasion of the receiver’s intim a te and clos e in tim a te zones. In gene ral, the wris t hold and the elbo w grasp are acceptable o n ly between close friends or relatives and in these cases, the in itiator’s left h a nd penetrates onl y th e receiver’s intim a te zone. The shoulder hold (F igure 37) and the upper ar m grip (Figure 36) enter th e receiver’s close intim ate zone and m a y involve actual body contact. They should be used only between people who experience a close em otional bond at the tim e of the ha ndshake. Unless the extra feeling is mutual or the initiator does not have a good reason for using a double-handed handshake, the re ceiv e r will b ecom e suspiciou s a nd m i strust the in itiato r’s intention s .

In the course of the c onversation our friend suddenly sat back in her chair, sm iled broadly, rubbed her palm s together and exclaim e d, ‘ I can hardly wait to go!’ Non-verba lly she had told us that she expected the trip to be a b i g succes s. Rubbing the palm s together is a way in which people non-verbally com m unicate positiv e exp ectation. Th e dice th ro wer rubs the dice between his palm s as a sig n of his positiv e exp ectancy of winning, th e m a ster of cere m onies rubs his palm s together and says to his audience, ‘W e have long looked forward to h earing our n e xt sp eaker’, and the excited sa le s person struts into th e sales m a nager’s office, rubs his palm s together and says excitedly, ‘We’ve just got a big order, boss!’ However, the waiter who com e s to your table at the end of the evening rubbing his palm s together and asking, ‘Anything else, sir?’ is non-verbally telling you that he is expecting a tip. The speed at which a person rubs his palm s together signals whom he thinks will rece ive the p o sitiv e resu lts that a r e ex pected. Say, for example, you want to buy a hom e and you go to see a real es tate agent. After describing the property you are seeking, the agent rubs his palm s together quickly and says, ‘I’ve g o t just the right place for you!’ Th e agent has sig n alled that h e expects th e results to be to your benefit. But how woul d you feel if he rubbed his palm s together very slowly as he told you that he had the ideal property? He woul d then appear to be crafty or devious and would give you the fee ling that the exp ected results would be to his advantage rather than your s. Sales people are taught that if they use the palm rub gesture when describing products or servic es to prospective buyers, they should be certain to use a fast hand action to avoid putting the buyer on the defensive. W h en the buyer rubs his palm s together and says to th e sales person, ‘Let’s see what you have to offer!’ it is a signal that the buyer is exp ecting to be shown som e thing. good and is likely to m a ke a purchase. A word of warning: a p e rson who is stan d i ng at a bus term inal in freezing winter conditions and who rubs his palm s together b r iskly m a y not necessarily be doing th is because he is expecting a bus.

It is often used by sales people who rub their fingertips and thum b together and say to th eir custom ers ‘I can save you 40 per cent’, or the person who rubs his index finger and thum b together a nd says to his friend, ‘Lend m e ten dollars’. This is obviously a gestur e that should be avoided at all tim es by a professional person when dealing with his clients. Hands Clenched Together At f i rst this seem s to be a conf idence gesture as som e people who use it are often sm iling and sound happy. However, on one particular occasion, w e saw a sales person describ i ng the sale he h a d jus t lo st.

This was therefore a gesture showing a frustrated or hostile attitude. Research by Nierenb e rg and Calero on th e hands-clenched positio n brought them to the conclusion that this was a frustration gesture, signalling that the person was holding back a negative attitude. The gesture has three m a in positio ns; hands c l enched in front of the face, (Figu r e 39), hands resting on th e desk (Figu r e 40) or on the lap wh en seated and placed in front of the cro t ch w h en standing (Figure 41).

Steepling Hands I stated at the beginning of this book that ge stures com e in clusters, like words in a sentence, and that they must be interpreted in th e contex t in whic h they are observed. ‘Steep ling’, as Birdwhis tell called it, can be an e x ception to these rules, as it is of ten used in isolation of other ge stures. In fact, people who are confident, superior types or who use m i nim a l or restricted body gestures often use this gesture, and, by doing so, they sign al their conf ide n t attitud e . My observation and research into th is f a scinating gesture sh o w that it is f r equently used in superior/subordinate interaction and that it can be an isolated gesture which indicates a confident or ‘know -it-all’ attitude. M a nagers often use this ges t ure pos ition"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"when giving instructions or advice to subordinates and it is particularly common a m ong accountants, lawyers, m a nagers and the like. The gesture has two versions; the raised steeple (Figure 42), the position norm a lly taken when the steepler is giving his opinions or ideas and is doing the talking. The lowered steeple gesture (Figure 43) is norm a lly used when the s t eep le r is lis ten i ng rather than speaking. Nierenberg and Calero noted that wom e n tend to use the lowered steep le position m o re often than the raised s t eeple position. W h en the raised s t eeple position is taken with th e head tilted bac k, the p e rson assumes an air of sm ugness or arrogan ce. Although th e steep le ges t ure is a positive s i gnal, it can be used in eith er p o sitiv e or negativ e circum stances and m a y be mis interp reted . For exam ple, a salesm an presenting his p r oduct to a po tential buyer m a y have observ e d several p o sitiv e gestu r es g i ven by the buyer during the interview.

On the othe r hand, if the steeple gesture follows a series of negative gestures such as arm folding, leg crossing, looking away and numerous hand-to-face gestures, and if the buyer takes the steeple position towards the close of the sale s presentation, the buyer may be confident that he will not buy or that he can get rid of the salesman. In both these cases the steeple gesture means confidence, but one has positive results and the other negative consequences for the salesman. The movements preceding the steep le gesture are the key to the outcome. GRIPPING HANDS, ARMS AND WRISTS Several prominent male members of the British Royal Family are noted for their habit of walking with their head up, chin out and one palm gripping the other hand behind the back. Not only does British Royalty use this gesture; it is common among Royalty of many countries. On the local scen e, the gesture is used by the policeman patrolling his beat, the headma ster of the local school when he is walking through the school yard, senior military personnel and others in a position of authority."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" This is the r ef ore a sup e rior ity /conf idence gesture position.

Our observation of Australian police officer s has shown that the officers who do not wear firearms use this gesture frequently a nd often rock back and forth on the balls of the feet. However, the police officers who do w ear firearms seldom display this gesture, using the hands-on-hips aggr essive gesture instead (Fi gure 98). It seems that the firearm itself has sufficient authority for its wearer so that the palm-in-palm gesture becomes unnecessary as a display of authority. The palm-in-palm gesture should not be confused with the hand-gripping-wrist gesture (Figure 45) which is a signal of frustrat ion and an attempt at self-control. In this case one hand grips the other wrist or arm very tig htly as if it is an attempt by one arm to prevent the other from striking out. Interestingly, the further the hand is move d up the back, the more angry the person has become. The man in Figure 46, for exam ple, is showing a greater attempt at self-control than the man in Figure 45 becau se the hand in Figure 46 is gripping the upper arm, not just the wrist. It is this ty pe of gesture that ha s given rise to such expressions as, ‘Get a good grip on yourself’. This gesture is often used by sales people who have called on a potential buyer and have been asked to wait in the buyer’s reception area. It is a poor attempt by the salesman to disguise his nervousness and an astute buyer is likely to se nse this. If a self-control gesture is changed to the palm-in-palm position, a calming and confident feeling results. THUMB DISPLAYS In palmistry, the thumbs denote strength of character and ego and the non-verbal use of thumbs agrees with this. They are us ed to display dominance, superiority or even aggression; thumb gestures are secondary gestures, a su pportive part of a gesture cluster. Thumb displays are positive signals, often used in the typical pose of the ‘cool’ manager who uses them in the presence of subordinates. A courting man uses them in the presence of a potential female part ner and they are common among people who wear high-status or prestig e clothing. People wearing ne w, attractive clothing use thumb displays more frequently than those who wear olde r, outdated clothing. The thumbs, which display superiority, b ecome most obvious when a person gives a contradictory verbal message. Take, for exam ple, the lawyer who turns to the jury and in a soft, low voice says, ‘In my humble opini on, ladies and gentlemen of the jury ...’ while displaying dominant thumb gestures a nd tilting back his head to ‘look down his nose’ (Figure 48). This has the e ffect of making the jury feel that the lawyer is insincere, even pompous. If the lawyer wished to appear humble, he should have approached the jury with one foot toward them, his coat open, an open palm display and stooping forward a little to show humility, or even subordination to the jury."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" Thum bs m o st often protrude from peopl e’s po ckets, som e tim es from the back pockets (Fig ure 49) in a secre tive m a nner to try to hide the p e rson’s dominant attitud e .

"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Five Hand-to-Face Gestures DECEIT, DOUBT, LYING How can you tell when som e one is lying? Recognition of the non-verbal deceit gestures can be one of the m o st im portant observation skills one can acquire. So what deceit signals can give p e ople away ? One of the most commonly used symbols of deceit is that of the three wise m onkeys who hear, speak and see no evil. The hand-to-face actions d e picted form the basis of th e hum a n deceit gestures (Figure 53). In other words, when we see, speak and hear untruths o r deceit, we often attem p t to cover ou r m outh, eyes or ears w ith our hand s. We have already m e ntioned that children us e these obvious d eceit gestures quite openly. If the young child tells a lie, he will of ten cover his m out h with his hands in an attem p t to stop the deceitful words from com i ng out. If he does not wish to listen to a reprim anding parent, he sim p ly covers his ears w ith his hands. W h en he sees som e thing he doesn’t wish to look at, he covers his eyes with his hands or arm s . As a person becom e s ol der, the han d -to-face gestures beco m e m o re refined and less obvious but they still occur when a person is lying , covering up or witnessing deceit; deceit can also m ean doubt, uncertainty, lying or exaggeration. When som e one uses a hand-to-face gesture, it does not always m ean that he or she is lyin g. It d o es, however, indicate that the p e rs on m a y be deceiv i ng y ou and furth e r observation of his other gesture clusters can confirm your suspicions.

This chapte r lo oks at the variations in hand- to-face gestures and discusses how and when they occur. The Mouth Guard The m outh guard is one of the few adult gest ures that is as obv ious as a child’s. The hand covers the m outh and the thumb is pr ess e d agains t the cheek as the brain s ub- consciously instru cts it to try and suppre ss the deceitful words that are being said . Som e tim es this gesture m a y only be several fi ngers over the mouth or even a closed f i st, but its m eaning rem a ins the sam e . The m outh guard is not to be confused with evaluation ge stures, whic h will be covered late r in th is cha p ter. Many people try to disguise the m outh guard gesture by giving a fake cough. W h e n playing the role of a gangster or crim inal, the late Hum phr ey Bogart often used this gesture whe n discussin g crim inal activ it ies with other gangsters or when being interrogated by the pol ice to show non-verbally that he was being dishonest. If the person who is speaking uses this gest ur e, it indicates tha t he is te lling a lie. If , however, he covers his mouth while you are speaking, it indi cates that he feels you are lying! One of the m o st unset tling sights a public speaker ca n see is h i s audience all using this gesture whilst he is speaking. In a sm al l audience or a one-to-one situation, it is wise to stop the presentation or delivery and ask, ‘W ould s o m e one care to comm ent on what I’ve just said?’ T h is allows the audience’s objections to be brought out into the open, giving you the opportunity to qualify your statem ents and to answer questions. Nose Touching In essence, the nose touch ge sture is a sophisticated, disg uised version of the m outh guard gesture. It m a y consist of several light rubs below the nose or it m a y be one quick, alm o st im pe rceptible touch. Som e wom e n pe rform this gesture with s m all discree t strokes to avoid sm udging their m a ke -up. One explanation of the origin of the nos e touch gesture is that, as the negative thought enters the m i nd, the subconscious inst ructs the hand to cover the mouth, but, at the last m o ment, in an a t tem p t to appe ar le ss obvious, the hand pulls away from the face"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"and a quick nose touch gesture is the result. Another explanati on is tha t ly ing caus es the delicate nerve endings in the nose to tingle, and the rubbing action takes place to satisfy this f e e ling. ‘But what if the person only has an itchy nos e?’ is frequently asked. The itch in a person’s nose is norm a lly satisfied by a very deliberate r ubbing or scratching action, as op posed to the ligh t strokes of the nose touch ge sture. Like the mouth guard gesture, it can be used both by the speaker to disgu i se his own deceit and by the lis tener who doubts the speaker’s words. The Eye Ru b ‘See no evil’ says the wise m onkey, and this gesture is the brain’s attem p t to block out the deceit, doubt or lie that it sees or to avoid h a ving to lo o k at the face of the perso n to whom he is te lling the lie. M e n usu a lly ru b their eyes vigorously and if the lie is a big one they will often look away, normally towa rds the floor. Wom e n use a sm all, gentle rubbing m o t i on just belo w the eye, either because they have been brough t up to avoid m a king robust gestures, or to avoid sm udging m a ke-up. They also avoid a listener’s gaze by look ing at the ceiling. ‘Lying through your teeth’ is a common phras e. It refers to a gesture cluster of clenched teeth and a fals e sm ile, combined w ith the eye rub g e sture and an averted gaze. This gesture is used by movie ac tors to portr ay ins i ncer ity, bu t is ra rely see n in re al lif e. The Ear Ru b This is, in e f f ect, an atte mpt by the listen e r to ‘h ear no evil’ in trying to block the words by putting the hand around or over the ear. This is the sophisticated adult version of the handsover-both-ears gesture used by the young child who wants to block out his parent’s reprim ands. Other variations of the ear rub gesture include rubbing the back of the ea r, the f i nger drill ( w here the f i ngertip is screwed back and fo rth inside the ear), pulling at the earlobe or bending the entire ear forward to co ver the earh ole. This las t gesture is a signal that the person has heard enough or m a y want to speak."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" The Neck Scratch In this cas e, the index f i nger of the wr iti ng hand scratches below the earlobe, or m a y even scratch the side of the neck. Our observa tion of this gestu r e .reve a ls a n inter e sting point: the person scratches about five tim es. Ra rely is the num ber of scratches less tha n five and seldom m o re t h an five. This gestur e is a signal of doubt or uncertainty and is charac teristic of the pe rs on who says , ‘I’m not su re I agre e.’ It is very no ticeable when the verbal language contradicts it, for exam pl e, when the person says something like, ‘I can understand how you feel.’ The Collar Pull Des m ond Morris noted that resear ch into the gestures of those who tell lies revealed that the te lling of a lie c a u sed a ting l ing sensa tion in the de lica te f acial and neck tissues and a rub or scratch was required to satisfy it. This seem s to be a reasonable explanation of why som e people use the collar pull gesture when they tell a lie and susp ect that th ey have been caught out. It is alm o st as if the li e causes a slight trickle of sweat to form on the neck when the deceiver feels that you suspect he is lying . It is also u s ed when a person is feeling angry or frustrated and need s to pull the collar away from his neck in an attem p t to let the cool air circulate around it. When you see som e one use this gesture, a question like, ‘W ould you repeat that, please?’ or, ‘Could you clarify that point, please?’ can cause the would-be d eceiver to give the gam e away."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" Fingers in the Mouth Morris’s exp l anation of this ges t ure is that the fin g ers are placed in the m o uth when a person is under pressure. It is an unconsci ous attem p t by the person to revert to the security of the child sucking on his moth er’s b r east. The yo ung child su bstitu tes h i s thum b for the breast and as an adult, he not only puts his fingers to his m o uth but inserts such thing s as cigarettes , pi pes, pens and the like into it. W h e r eas m o st hand-to-m outh gestures inv o lve ly ing or decep tio n, the fing ers-in-m outh gestu r e is an ou tward m a nifestation of an inner need for reassu rance. Giving the pers on gu arantees an d assurances is appropriate when th is gesture appears (Figure 60). INTERPRETING AND MISINTERPRETI NG The ability to accurately inte rpret ha nd-to-face gestures in a given set of circum stances takes con s iderab le tim e and obse r vation to acquire. W e can confidently assum e that, when a person uses on e of th e hand-to-face gestur es just m e ntioned, a negative thought has entered his m i nd. The quest ion is, what is the negative? It could be doubt, deceit, uncertainty, exaggeration, appr ehension or outright lying. The real skill of interpre ta tion is the a b ility to pic k whic h of t h e negatives m e n tioned is the correct one. This can best be do ne by an an alysis of the gestures pr eceding the hand-to-face gesture and interpreting it in context."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"For example, a friend of mine with whom I play chess often rubs his ear or touches his nose during the game, but only when he is unsure of his next move. Recently I noticed some of his other gestures that I can interpret and use to my advantage. I have discovered that when I signal my intention to move a chess piec e by touching it, he immediately uses gesture clusters that signa l what he thinks about my proposed move. If he sits back in the chair and uses a st eepling gesture (confidence), I can assume that he has anticipated my move and may alrea dy have thought of a counter move. If, as I touch my chess piece, he covers his mouth or rubs his nose or ear, it means that he is uncertain about my move, his next move or both. This means that the more moves I can make after he has reacted with a negative ha nd-to-face gesture, the greater my chances of winning. I recently interviewed a young man who had arrived from overseas for a position in our company. Throughout the interview he kept his arms and legs crossed, used critical evaluation clusters, had very little palm exposure and hi s gaze met mine less than one-third of the time. Something was obviously worrying him, but at that point in the interview I did not have sufficient informa tion for an accurate assessment of his negative gestures. I asked him some questi ons about his previous employers in his native country. His answers were accomp anied by a series of eye-rubbing and nose-touching gestures and he continued to avoid my gaze. This continued throughout the rest of the interview and eventually I decided not to hire him, based on what is commonly called ‘gut feeling’. Being curious about his deceit gest ures, I decided to check his overseas referees and discovered that he had given me false information about his past. He probably assumed that a potential employer in another country would not bother to check overseas references and, had I not been aware of non-verbal cues and signals, I might well have made the mistake of hiring him. During a videotape role play of an interv iew scene at a management seminar, the interviewee suddenly covered his mouth and ru bbed his nose after he had been asked a question by the interviewer. Up to that point in the role-play, the interviewee had kept an open posture with open coat, palms vi sible and leaning forward when answering questions, so at first we thought it might have been an isol ated series of gestures. He displayed the mouth guard gesture for severa l seconds before giving his answer, then returned to his open pose. We questioned hi m about the hand-to-mouth gesture at the end of the role play and he sa id that, when he had been as ked the particular question, he could have responded in two ways; one negati ve, one positive. As he thought about the negative answer and of how the interviewer might react to it, the mouth guard gesture occurred. When he thought of the positiv e answer, however, his hand dropped away from his mouth and he resumed his open postu re. His uncertainty about the audience’s possible reaction to the negativ e reply had caused the sudden mouth guard gesture to occur. These examples illustrate how easy it can be to misinterpret a hand-to-face gesture and to jump to wrong conclusions. It is onl y by constant study and observation of these gestures and by having regard to the context in which they occur that one can eventually learn to reach an accurate assessment of someone’s thoughts.

Every sa les pers on knows the em pt y feeling that results when he o r she is giving a sales presentation to a potential buyer who says very little and just sits there watching. F o rtunately a num b er of hand-to-che ek and hand-to-chin gestures can tell the sales person how well he is doing. Boredom When the listener begins to use his hand to support his head, it is a signal that boredom has set in and his supporting hand is an attem p t to hold his head up to stop him s elf from falling asleep. The d e g r ee of the lis tener ’ s bo re dom is re la te d to the exte nt to which his arm and hand are supporting his head. Extrem e boredom and lack of interest are shown when the head is fu lly supported by the hand (Figure 61) and the ultim ate bor edom signal occurs when the head is on the desk or table and the person is snoring! Drumm i ng the fingers on the table and con tinual tapping of the feet on the floor are often m i sinterpreted by professional speaker s as boredom signals, but in fact they signal im patience. W h en you as a speaker noti ce these signals, a strategic move m u st be m a de to get the finger drumm e r or foot tapper involved in yo ur lecture, thus avoiding his negative effect on the othe r m e mbers of the audience. The audience who displays boredom and im patience signals to g e ther is telling the speak er tha t it is tim e f o r him to end the speech. It is worth noting that the speed of the finger tap or foot tap is related to the extent of the person’s im patience – th e faster the taps, th e m o re impatient th e listener is becom i ng. Evaluation Evaluation is shown by a closed hand resti ng on the cheek, often with the index finger pointing upwards (Figure 62). Should the person begin to lose interest but wish to appear interested, f o r courtesy ’s s a ke, the position will alte r slightly so that the hee l of the palm supports the head, as show n in Figure 61. I have attended num erous m a nage m e nt m eetings where the young up-andcom ing managers have used this interest gesture to s how respect to the company president who is giving a boxing speech.

Genuine interest is show n when the hand is on the cheek, not used as a head support. An easy way f o r the pr esiden t to g a in th eir individual attention would be to sa y som e thing like, ‘I’m glad that you are paying attention becau s e in a m o m e nt I’m going to ask questions!’ This rivets his lis t eners’ atten t ion to his sp eech becaus e of the fear that they will not be able to answer the questions. When the index finger points vertically up the cheek and the thum b supports the chin, the listener is having ne gative or critical thoughts abou t the speaker or his subject. Often the index finger m a y rub or pull at the eye as the negativ e thoughts continue. Because a gesture pos ition affects a person’ s attitude, the lo nger a perso n holds the gesture, the longer the critic al attitude will rem a in. This gesture is a signal that imm e diate action is requ ired by the s p eaker, eithe r by invo lving the lis ten e r in what h e is saying or by ending the speech. A si m p le move, such as handing som e thing to the listener to alte r his pos e, can caus e a change in his attitu de. This gesture is of ten m i staken as a signal of interest, but th e supporting thum b tells the truth about the critica l a ttitu de (Figure 6 3 ). Chin Stroking The next tim e you have the opportunity to present an idea to a group of people, watch them carefully as you give yo ur idea and you will no tice som e thin g fascinatin g. Most, if not all the m e mbers of your audience will bring one hand up to their faces and begin to use evaluation gestures. As you co m e t o the conclusion of your presentation and ask for the group to give opinions or suggestions about the idea, the evaluation gesture s will cease. One hand will m ove to th e c h in and begin a chin-s tro k ing gestu r e . This chin-stroking gesture is th e s i gn al that the lis t ener is m a king a decision. W h e n you have asked the listeners for a decision and their gestures have changed from evaluation to decision -m aking, the followi ng movements will indicate whether th eir decis i on is n e gativ e or p o sitiv e. A sales per s on would be f oolish to inte rru pt or to spe a k when a buyer begins the chin-s troking gesture after he has been asked for a decision to purchase. His best strategy would be a caref ul observation of the buyer’s next gestures, which will indicate the decis i on he has reac hed. If , f o r example, the c h in-stroking"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"gesture is followed by crossed arm s and legs and the buyer sits back in his chair, the sales person has been non-verb ally told, ‘No’. He would be wise to review the m a in points of the presenta tion imm e diately before the buyer verbalises his negative answer and the sale m a y be lost. If the chin-stroking gesture is followed by the readine ss gesture (Figure 100) the sales person only needs to ask how the buye r would prefer to pa y for the product and the buyer will pro ceed to m a ke his pu rchase. Variations of Decision -Making Gestures Som e one who wears glasses often follows evaluation clusters by rem o ving them and putting one arm of t h e fra m e in his m out h instead of using the chin-stroking gesture when m a king a decision. A pipe-sm oker will put his pipe in his m outh. When a person places an ob ject su ch as a pen or a finger in his mouth after having been asked for a decision, it is a sig n al th at he is unsu r e and reassurance is needed becau se the ob ject in his m outh allows him to stall m a king an im m e di ate decision.

A person who uses this when lying usually avoids your gaze and looks down. Th is gesture is also used as a signal of frustration or anger and, when this is the case, the hand slap s the back of the neck first and then begins to rub the neck. Let us assum e , for example, that you asked a subordinate to com p lete a certa in task for you and that the subordinate had forgotten to do it within the tim e required. W h en you ask hi m for the results, he non-verbally signals his forgetfulness by slapping his head, either on the forehead or the back of the neck, as if he were sym bolically hitting him s elf. Although slapping of the head comm unicates forgetfulnes s, the person signals how he feels about you or the situation by the position used when he slaps his hand on his head, either the fore head or the neck. If he slaps h i s forehead (Figure 69) he signals that he is not intim i dated by your having m e ntioned his forgetfulness, but when he sl aps the back of his neck (Figure 68) he non-verbally tells you that you are literally a ‘pain-in-the-n eck’ f o r pointing out his error.

As children, we hid behind solid objects such as tables, chairs, furniture and mother’s skirts whenever we found ourselves in a threatening situation. As we grew older, this hiding behaviour became more sophisticated and by the age of about six, when it was unacceptable behaviour to hide behind solid objects, we learned to fold our arms tightly across our chests whenever a threatening situation arose. During our teens, we learned to make this crossed-arms gesture a little less obvious by relaxing our arms a little and combining the gesture with crossed legs. As we grow older, we develop the arm crossing gesture to the point where it has become less obvious to others. By folding one or both arms across the chest, a barrier is formed that is, in essence, at attempt to block out the impending threat or undesirable circumstances. One thing is certain; when a person has a nervous, negative or defensive attitude, he will fold his arms firmly on his chest, a strong signal that he feels threatened. Research conducted into the folded arm position in the United States has shown some interesting results. A group of students wa s asked to attend a seri es of lectures and each student was instructed to keep his le gs uncrossed, arms unfolded and to take a casual, relaxed sitting position. At the end of the lectures each student was tested on his retention and knowledge of the subject matter and hi s attitude toward the lecturer was recorded. A second group of students was put through the same process, but these students were instructed to k eep their arms tightly folded across their chests throughout the lectures. The results showed that the group with the folded arms had learned and retained 38 per cent less than the group who kept its arms unfolded. The second group also had a more critical opinion of the lectures and of the lecturer. These tests reveal that, when the listen er folds his arms, not only has he more negative thoughts about the speaker , but he is also paying less attention to wh at is being said. It is for this reason that training centres should have chairs with arms to allow the attendees to leave their arms uncrossed. Many people claim that they habitually ta ke the arms folded position because it is comfortable. Any gesture w ill feel comfortable when you have the corresponding attitude; that is, if you have a negative, defensive or nervous attitude, the folded arms position will feel good. Remember that in non-verbal communication, the meaning of the message is also in the receiver, not only the sender. You may feel ‘comfortable’ with your arms crossed or your back and neck stiffened, but studies have shown that the reception of these gestures is negative."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Standard Arm-Cross Gesture Both arm s are folded together acro ss the chest as an attempt to ‘hide’ from an unfavourable situation. Th ere are m a ny ar m -folding pos itions, but this book will discuss the three m o st comm on ones. The stan dard arm - cross gesture (Figure 70) is a universal gesture signifying the sam e defensive or negative attitude alm o st everywhere. It is comm only seen when a person is a m ong s t rangers in public m e etings, queues, cafeterias, elevators o r anywhere that people feel uncertain or insecure. During a recent lecture tour in the United States, I opened one particular meeting by deliberately defam i ng the character of se veral highly respected men who were well-known to the sem i nar audience and who were attendi ng the conference. Imm e diately following the verb al attack, th e m e mbers of th e audience were asked to hold the position s and gesture s the y had ta ken. They were all quite am used when I pointed ou t that abou t 90 per ce nt of them had taken the f o lded arm s position imm e diately after m y verbal a ttack began. This clearly shows that m o st people will take an arm s folded position when they disagr ee with what they are hearing. Many public speakers have failed to communicate their m e ssage to the audience because they have not seen th e folded arm s gestures of their li steners . Experienced speakers k now that this gesture demonstrates the necessity of usi ng a goo d ‘ice b r eak er’ to m ove the audience into a m o re recep tive po sture th at will alter the li steners’ attitude towards the speak er. When you see the arm - cross gesture occu r during a face-to -face encou n ter, it is reasonable to assum e that you m a y have sa id som e thing with which the other person disagrees, so it m a y be pointless continuing your line of argument even though the other person m a y be verbally agreeing with you. The fact is that the non-verbal m e dium doe s not lie -the verbal m e dium does. Your objectiv e at this point should be to try to discover the cause of the arm s -folded gestu r e and to m o ve the perso n into a m o re recep tiv e position. Rem e mber: as long as the arm s -folded gesture rem a ins, the negative attitude will rem a in. The attitude causes the g e stures to o c cur and p r olonging the g e sture forces the attitude to rem a in. A si m p le but effective m e thod of breaking th e folded-arm s position is to hand the person a pen, a book or som e thing that forces him to unfold his arm s to reach forward."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"This m oves him into a m o re open posture and attitude. Asking the person to le an forward to look at a visual presentation can also be an effective m eans of opening the folded-arm s position. Another us eful m e thod is to lean fo rward with your palm s facing up and say, ‘I can see you have a question, wh at would you like to know?’ or, ‘W hat do you think? ’ and then sit back to indicate that it is the other person’s turn to speak. By leaving your palm s visible you non-verbally te ll the other person that you would like an open, honest answer. As a salesm an, I would ne ver proceed w ith the presentation of my product until I had uncovered the prospective buyer’s reason for suddenly folding his arm s . More often than not, I discovered th at the buyer had a hidden objection that most other sales people m i ght neve r have discovered because th ey m i ssed seeing the buyer’s non-verbal signal that he was negative about som e aspect of the sales presentation. Reinforced Arm-Cross If as well as the full arm-cross gestu r e the perso n has clench ed fists, it in dicates a hostile and def e nsive a t titud e . This cluster is of ten com b ined with clenc h ed tee t h an d red face, in which case a verbal or physical attack m a y be imminent.

The pe rson using this gesture cluste r has an attacking attitud e , as opposed to the person in Figure 70, w ho has taken a defending arm c ross position. Arm Gripp i ng Gestur e You will notice that this arm - cross gestur e is c h arac ter i sed by the han d s tightly gripping the upper arm s to reinforce the posit ion and to stop any attem p t to unfold the arm s and expose the body.

Status can influence arm - folding gestures. A superior type can m a ke his superiority felt in the presence of persons he has just m e t by not folding his arm s . Say, for exa m ple, that at a co mpany social function, the ge neral m a nager is introduced to several new em ployees whom he has not m e t. Having gr eeted them with a dom inant handshake, he stands at the social d i stance from the new em ployees with his hands by his side, behind his back in the superi or palm -in-palm position (see Figure 44), or with one hand in his pocket. He rarely folds his arm s to show the slightest hint of nervousness. Conversely, after shaking hands with the boss, the new employees take full or partial arm - fol d gestures because of their apprehension about being in the presence of the com p any’ s top m a n. Both the general m a nager and the ne w employees feel com f ortable with their respective gestures as each, is signalling his status relative to the other. But what happens when the general m a nager m eets a young, up-and-com i ng exe c utive who is also a superior type and who m a y even feel tha t he is as important as the g e neral m a nager? T h e likely o u tcom e is that af ter th e two give each other a dom i nant handshake, the young executive w ill take an arm - fold gesture with both thum bs pointing ver tica lly u p wards (Figu r e 73). This g e sture is the def e nsive version of both arm s being held horizontally in front of th e body with both thum bs up to show that the user is ‘cool’, a gesture characterised by Henry W i nkler who played the Fonz in the television series Happy Days. The thum bs-up gesture is our way of showing that w e have a self-confident attit ude and the folded arm s give a feeling of protection.

The partial arm barrier is often seen at m eetings where a person m a y be a stranger to the group or is lacking in self-confidence. Another popular version of a partial arm barrier is holding hands with oneself (Fi gure 74), a gesture commonly used by people who stand before a crow d to receive an aw ard or give a speech.

Like a ll arm-cross gestures, one arm s w ings across in front of the body to grasp the other arm but instead of the arm s folding, one hand touches a handbag, bracelet, watc h, shirt cuff or other objec t on or near the other arm (Figure 76). Once again the barrier is for m ed and the secure feeling is achieved.

A good place to observe these gestur es is anywhere that people walk past a group of onlookers, such as a young man who crosses the da nce floor to ask an attractive young lady to dance with him or someone crossing an open room to receive a trophy. Women are less obvious than men in their use of disguised arm barrier gestures because they can grasp such things as handba gs or purses when they become unsure of themselves (Figure 77). One of the most co mmon versions of this is holding a glass of beer or wine with two hands. Did it ever occur to you that you need only one hand to hold a glass of wine? The use of two hands allows the nervous person to form an almost undetectable arm barrier. Having observed pe ople using disguised arm barrier signals on many occasions, we have found that these gestures are used by almost everyone. Many well-known figures in society also us e disguised barrier signals in tense situations and are usually completely unawa re that they are doing so (Figure 78). "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Seven Leg Barriers CROSSED-LEG GESTURES Like arm barrier gestures, crossed legs ar e a signal that a negative or defensive attitude may exist. The purpose of crossing the arms on the chest was originally to defend the heart and upper body region and crossing the legs is an attempt to shield the genital area. Crossed arms also indicate a mo re negative attitude th an do crossed legs, and the arms gesture is more obvious. Care should be ta ken when interpreting crossed leg gestures with women as many have been ta ught that this is how to ‘sit like a lady’. Unfortunately for them, however, the gest ure can make them seem defensive. There are two basic crossed leg-sitting c onditions, the standard leg cross and the figure 4 leg lock. The Standard Leg-Cross Position One leg is crossed neatly over the other, usually the right over the left. This is the normal crossed-leg position used by Eur opean, British, Australian and New Zealand cultures and may be used to show a nervous, reserved or defensive attitude. However, this is usually a supportive gesture that o ccurs with other negative gestures and should not be interpreted in isolation or out of context. For exampl e, people often sit like this during lectures or if they are on uncomfortable chairs for long periods. It is also common to see this gesture in cold weather. When the crossed legs gesture is combined with crossed arms (Figure 80), the person ha s withdrawn from the conversation. A sales person would be very foolish ev en to attempt to ask for a decision from a buyer when he has taken this pose, and the sales person should ask probing ques tions to uncover his objection.

Throughout his speech the sales people in the audience were leaning forward showing interest, many using evaluation gestures, but the managers held their defensive positions. The salesman then changed his address to discuss what he believed the manager’s role should be in relation to the sales people. Almost as if they were players in an orchestra who had been given a comma nd by the orchestra leader, the managers shifted to the competitive/argumentative posit ion (Figure 81). It was obvious that they were mentally debating the salesman’s point of view and many later confirmed that this had been the case. I noticed, however, that several managers had not taken this pose. After the meeting I asked them why, and, alth ough most said they had also disagreed with the salesman’s views, they were unabl e to sit in the figure 4 leg lock position for such reasons as obesity and arthritis. In a selling situation it woul d be unwise to attempt to close the sale and ask for the order when the buyer takes this position. The sales person would need to use an open appeal, leaning forward with palms up and saying, ‘I can see you have some ideas on this. I’d be interested in your opinion’, and then sit back to signify that it is the buyer’s turn to speak. This gives the buyer an opportunity to tell you his opinion.

I asked, ‘How do you enjoy this jo b? ’ He replied, ‘Fine!

Interestingly, we have noticed that sales people who do not enjoy using the telephon e sit in the locked ankles pos ition. Leaders in the field of negotiating tech- niques, Nierenberg and Calero, found that whenever one party locked his ankles duri ng a negotiation it often m eant that he was holding back a valuable concession. They f ound that, by using ques tioning techniques, they could often encourage him to unloc k his ankles and reveal the concession. There are always people who claim that they habitually sit in the ankle lock position, or for that matter, any of the negative arm and leg clusters, because they feel comfort- able. If you are one of these people, rem e m b er that any ar m or leg position will feel comfortable when you have a defensive, negativ e or reserved attit ude. Considering that a negative g e sture can increas e or p r olong a n e gative attitu de, and that other p e ople interpret you as being defensive or negative, you would be well advised to practise using positive and open gestures to im prove your self-confidence and relationships with others.

This includes standing behind a gate, doorway, fence, desk, the open door of his m o tor vehicle and stradd ling a chair (F igu r e 91). The back of th e chair prov id es a sh ield to protect his body and can transform him into an aggressive, dom i nant warrior. Mo st chair straddlers are dom inant individu als who will try to take control of other people or groups when they become bored with the conversation, an d the back of the chair serves as good protection from any ‘attack’ by other m e mber s of the group.

If you have a straddler coming to visit you and his aggressive attitude annoys you, be sure to seat him on a fi xed chair that has arms to stop him from taking his favourite position. Picking Imaginary Lint When a person disapproves of the opinions or attitudes of others but feels constrained in giving his point of view, the non-verbal gest ures that occur are known as displacement gestures, that is, they result from a withheld opinion. Picking imaginary pieces of lint from the clothing is one such gesture. The lintpicker usually looks away from the other people towards the floor while performing this minor , irrelevant action. This is one of the most common signals of disapproval and when the listener continually picks imaginary pi eces of lint off his clothing it is a good indication that he does not like what is being said, even though he may be verbally agreeing with everything. Open your palms and say, ‘Well, what do you think?’ or, ‘I can see you have some thoughts on this. Would you mind telling me what they are?’ Sit back, arms apart, palms visible, and wait for the answer. If th e person says he is in agreement with you but continues to pick the imaginary lint, you may need to take an even more direct approach to discove r his hidden objection. HEAD GESTURES This book would not be complete without a discussion of the basic head movements, the two most widely used being the head nod and the head shake. The head nod is a positive gesture used in most cultures to signify, ‘Yes’, or affirmation. Research conducted with people who have been deaf, dum b and blind from birth shows that they also use this gesture to signify the affirmative, which has given rise to the theory that this may be an inborn gesture. The headshak e, usually meaning ‘No’, is also claimed by some to be an inborn action; however, others have theorised that it is the first gesture a human being learns. They believe that wh en the newborn baby has had enough milk, he shakes his head from side to side to re ject his mother’s breast. Similarly, the young child who has had enough to eat uses the head shake to rej ect his parent’s attempt to spoonfeed him. One of the easiest ways to uncover a dis guised objection when dealing with others is to watch if the person uses the headshake gesture while verbalising his agreement with you. Take, for example, the person who verbalises, ‘Yes, I can see your point of view’, or, ‘I really enjoy working here’, or, ‘We’ll definitely do business after Christmas’, whilst shaking his head from side to side. Even though this may sound convincing, the head shake gesture signals th at a negative attitude exists and you would be well advised to reject what the pers on has said and to question him further. Basic Head Positions There are three basic head positions. The firs t is with the head up (Figure 93) and is the position taken by the person who has a neutra l attitude about what he is hearing. The head usually remains still and may occasionally give small nods. Hand-to-cheek evaluation gestures are ofte n used with this position."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"When the h ead tilts to one side it s hows that in teres t has developed (F igure 94).

W o men use this head position to s how interest in an attractive m a le. W h en others are speaking to you, all you need do is use the head-tilted position and head nods to m a ke the listener feel warm towards you. When the he ad is down, it signals that the attitude is negative and even judgm e ntal (Figure 95). Critical evaluati on clusters are norm ally m a de with the head down and, unless you can get the person’s head up or tilted, you m a y have a communication problem . As a public speaker, you will often be confronted by an audience whose m e mbers are all seated with head d o wn a nd arm s folded on the ch est. Professional speakers and trainers usually do som e thing that involves audience participation before they begin their addre ss. This is inten d ed to get the audience’s heads up and to get them involved. If the speaker’s ploy is successful, th e audience’s n e xt head pos ition will be the head tilted. Both Hands Behind Head This gesture is typical of such profe ssionals as accoun tants, lawyers, sales m a nagers, bank m a nagers or people who are fe e ling confident, dom inant, or superior about som e thing. If we could read the pe rson’s m i nd, he would be saying som e thing like, ‘I have all the answers’ or, ‘Maybe one day you’ll be as sm ar t as I am ’, or even ‘Everything’s under control’.

Would you care to comment?’ Then sit back, palms still visible, and wait for an answer. Another method is to force the man to change his posi tion, which will in turn change his attitude. This can be accomplished by placing somethi ng just out of his re ach and asking, ‘Have you seen this?’, forcing him to lean forw ard. Copying the gesture is another good way to handle it.

Unfortunately , most sales courses teach sales peop le always to as k f o r the ord e r with little rega rd for th e clien t ’s bo dy position and gestures. Learning to recognise such gestures as r eadiness not only helps m a ke more sales but helps to keep m a ny more people in the sell ing profession.

For this reason, rom a ntic encounters are often a rranged in dim l y lit places that cause the pupils to dilate.  Young lovers who look deeply into each other’s eyes unknowingly look for pupil dila tion; eac h becom e s excited by th e dila tion of the other’s pupils. Research has shown that when p o rnographic film s showi ng m e n and wom e n in sexual pos itio ns are shown to m e n, their pupils can dilate to almost three tim e s the norm a l size. When the sam e film s are shown to women their pupil dilation is even greater than that recorded by the m e n, which raises som e doubt about the st atem ent that wom e n are less stimulated by pornography than m e n. Young babies and children have larger pupils than adults and thei r pupils constantly dilate when adults are presen t in an attem p t to look as a ppealing as possible and thus rece ive cons tant a tten tio n. Tests conducted with expert card players show that fewer gam e s were won by the experts when their opponents wore dark gl asses. For exam ple, if an opponent were dealt four aces in a gam e of poker, his ra pid pupil dilation would be unconsciously de- tected by the expert, who woul d get a feeling that he shoul d not bet on the next hand. Dark glasses worn bythe opponents elim inated pupil signals and as a result the experts won fewer gam e s than usual. Pupil watching was used by the ancient Ch inese gem traders who watched for the pupil dilation of their buyers when negotiating prices. Centuries ago, prostitutes put drops of belladonna in their eyes to dilate their pupils and to m a ke them selves appear more desira ble. The la te Aristo tle Onassi s was noted for wearing dark glasses w h en negotiating business deals so that his eyes would not reveal his thoughts. An old cliché says, ‘Look a person in the eye when you talk to hi m . ’ W h en you are communicating or negotiating with others, pr actise ‘looking them in the pupil’ and let the pupils tell you thei r real feelings. GAZ E BEHAVIOUR It is only w h en you see ‘eye to eye’ with another pers on that a real basis for communication can b e estab lish e d . W h ile som e people can m a ke us feel quite comfortable when they converse with us, othe rs can m a ke us feel ill-at-ease and some seem untrustworthy. This has to do prim arily w ith the length of tim e that they look at us or hold our gaze as they speak. When a pe rson is being dishonest or holding back inform ation, his eyes m e et ours less than one -third of the time. W h en a person’s gaze m eets yours for m o re than twothirds of the tim e, it can m ean one of two things; first, he or she finds you very in teresting or appeali ng, in which case the g aze will be associated with dilated pupils; secondly, he or she is hostile towards you and m a y be issuing a non-verbal challenge, in which case the pupils will becom e constricted. Argyle reported that he found that when pers on A likes person B, he will look at him a lot. This"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"causes B to think that A likes him, so B will li ke A in return. In other words, to build a good rapport with another person, your gaze should meet hi s about 60 to 70 per cent of the time. This will also make him begin to like you. It is not surprising, therefore, that the nervous, timid person who m eets your gaze less than one-third. of the time is rarely trusted.. In negotiation, dark tinted glasses shoul d be avoided at all times as they make others feel that you are staring at them. Like most body language and gestures, the length of time that one person gazes at another is culturally determined. Southern Europeans have a high frequency of gaze that may be offensive to others and the Japane se gaze at the neck rather than at the face when conversing. Always be sure to consider cultural circumstances before jumping to conclusions. Not only is the length of the gaze significant; just as important is the geographical area of the person’s face and body at which you di rect your gaze, as this also affects the outcome of a negotiation. These signals are transmitted and received non-verbally and are accurately interp reted by the receiver. It takes about thirty days of conscious practice before the following eye techniques can be effectively used to im prove your communication skills. The Business Gaze (Figure 109) When having discussions on a business level, imagine that there is a triangle on the other person’s forehead. By keeping your gaze directed at this area, you create a serious atmosphere and the other person senses th at you mean business. Provided that your gaze does not drop below the level of the other person’s eyes, you are able to maintain control of the interaction."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" The Social Gaz e (Figure 110) When the g aze d r ops b e low the other pers on’s eye level, a social atmosphere develops.

The Intimate Gaz e (Figure 111) The gaze is across the ey es and below the ch in to other parts of the person’s body. In close encounters it is the tr iangular area between the eyes and the chest or breasts and for distan t g azing from the eyes to the cr o t ch. Men and wo m e n use this gaze to sho w inte rest in ea ch other and those who a r e in tere sted will return the gaze."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" Sidew ays G l ance The sideway s glance is u s ed to communicate either in ter e st or hostility. W h en it is com b ined with sligh tly raised eyeb r o ws or a s m ile, it communicates interest and is frequently used as a courtship signal. If it is combined with down-turned eyebrows, furrowed brow or the corners of the mouth down-turned, it signals a suspicious, hostile or critical attitude. Summary The area of the oth e r person’s body upon which you direct y our gaze can have a powerful effect on the o u tcom e of a ny face- to -face encoun ter.

The business gaze is the appropriate one to use, as it has a powerful effect on the receiver and tells him that you are serious. What men describe as the ‘come-on’ look that women use relates to a sideways glance and an intimate gaze. If a man or woma n wants to play hard to get, he or she needs only avoid using the intimate gaze and instead use the social gaze. To use the business gaze during courting would cause a ma n or woman to be labelled as cold or unfriendly. The point is that when you use the intimate gaze on a potential sex partner, you give the game away. Women are expert at sending and receiving th is type of gaze but unfortunately, most men are not. Men are usually obvious when they use the intimate gaze and they are generally unaware of having been given an intimate gaze, much to the frustration of the woman who has transmitted it. Eye Block Gesture Some of the most irritating people with w hom we deal are those who use the eye - block gesture as they speak. This gesture o ccurs unconsciously and is an attempt by the person to block you from his sight because he has become bored or uninterested in you or feels that he is superior to you. Compared to the normal rate of six to eight blinks per minute during conversation, the eyelids close and remain closed for a second or longer as the person momentarily wipes you from his mind. The ultimate blockout is to leave the eyes closed and to fall asleep, but this rarely happens during one-to-one encounters. If a person feels superior to you, the eye bl ock gesture is combin ed with the head tilted backwards to give you a long l ook, commonly known as ‘looking down one’s nose’. When you see an eye block gesture du ring a conversation, it is a signal that the approach you are using may be causing a ne gative reaction and that a new tack is needed if effective communication is to take place (Figure 112). CONTROLLING A PERSON’S GAZE It is worth discussing at th is point how to control a person’s gaze when you are giving him a visual presentation using books, charts, graphs and so on. Research shows that of the information relaye d to a person’s brain, 87 per cent comes via the eyes, 9 per cent via the ears, and 4 per cent via the othe r senses. If, for example, the person is looking at your visual aid as you are speaking, he will absorb as little as 9 per cent of your message if the message is not directly related to what he sees . If the message is related to the visual aid, he will absorb only 25 to 30 per cen t of your message if he is looking at the visual aid. To ma intain maximum control of his gaze, use a pen or pointer to point to the visual aid and at the same time verbalise wh at he sees (Figure 113). Next, lift the pen from the visual aid and hold it between his eyes and your own eyes (Figure 114). This has the magnetic effect of lifting hi s head so that he is looking at your eyes and now he sees and hears what you are sa ying, thus achieving maximum absorption of your message. Be sure that the palm of your other hand is visible when you are speaking. "},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Ten Courtship Gestures and Signals I have a friend named Graham who has develo ped an art that most males would love to acquire. Whenever he attends a social function he can quickly ‘psych out’ the available women, make his choi ce and, in almost record-bre aking time (sometimes as little as ten minutes), he may be seen heading towards the exit with the woman, escorting her to his car and drill ing back to his apartment. I have even seen him return to the party within an hour and repeat this am azing process two or three times in the same evening. He seems to have built-in radar for finding the right girl at the right time and getting her to go with him. Many people wonde r: what is the key to his success? Per- haps you know someone like Graham and have asked yourself the same question. Research into animal courtship behaviour conducted by zoologists and behavioural scientists reveals that male and female an imals use a series of intricate courtship gestures, some quite obvious and others ex tremely subtle, and that most are done subconsciously. In the animal world, courtship behaviour in each species follows specific and predetermined patterns. For exampl e, in several species of bird, the male struts around the female giving a vocal di splay, puffing up his feathers and performing many intricate body movements to gain her attention, while the female appears to display little or no interest. This ritual is similar to that perfor med by the human animal when courtship begins. Graham’s technique was to display male courtship gestures to the prospective females and those who were interested w ould respond with the appropriate female courtship signals, giving Graham the non-verb al green light to proceed with a more intimate approach. The success that people have in sexual en counters with members of the opposite sex is directly related to their ability to send courtship signals and to recognise those being sent back. Women are aware of the courtship gestures, as th ey are aware of most other body gestures, but men are far less perceptiv e, often being totally blind to them. It was interesting to note that women described Graham as ‘sexy’, ‘masculine’ and ‘someone who makes you feel feminine’; their reactions to his cons tant array of court- ship signals. Men, on the other hand, descri bed him as ‘aggressive’, ‘insincere’, and ‘arrogant’; their reaction to the aggressi ve competition that Graham represented. Consequently he had very fe w male friends, and the reasons for this should be obvious - no male likes a rival for the attentions of his female. ‘What gestures and body movements do peop le use to communicat e desire for in- volvement?’ is frequently asked. We will now list the signals used by both sexes to attract potential sexual partners. You will note that more space is devoted to female courtship signals than to male signals; this is because women have a greater range of courtship signals than men.

How we learn thes e signals is difficult to explain and a popular theory is that they m a y be inborn. Dr Albert S c heflen, in hi s article ‘Quasicourtship be ha vi our i n ps yc hot h e r a p y’ , noted that, when a person enters the com p a ny of a m e mber of the opposite sex, certain physiolog i cal changes take place. He found that high m u scle tone became evident in preparation for a possible sexual enc ounter, ‘bagging’ around the face and eyes decreased, body sagging disappeared, the chest protruded, the stom ach was autom a tically pulled in, pot-bellied slum ping disappeared, the body assum e d an erec t posture and the person appeared to becom e m o r e youthful in appearance. The ideal place to obs erve thes e changes is on a b each when a m a n and wom a n approach each other from a distance. The changes take p l ace when the m a n and wom a n are close enough to meet each o t h e r’s gaze an d continue u n til after th ey have p a ssed each other, at which time the original posture returns (Figures 115 to 117).

He may also preen hi mself by smoothing his hair. The most aggressive sexual display he can make towards the female is the aggressive thumbs-in-belt gesture that hi ghlights his genital region (see Figure 103). He may also turn his body towa rds her and point his foot at her. He uses the intimate gaze (Figure 111) and holds her gaze for a split second longer than normal. If he is really keen his pupils will be dilated. He often stands with his hands on hips (Figure 98) to accentuate his physical size and show his readiness to be involved with the female. When seated or leaning against a wall, he may also spread his legs to give a crotch display. When it comes to courtship rituals, most men are about as effective as someone standing in a river trying to catch fish by hitting them on the head with a big stick.

Even women with short hair may use this gesture. Exposed Wrists An interested female will gradually expose the smooth soft skin of her wrists to the potential male partner. The wrist area has l ong been considered one of the highly erotic areas of the body. The palms are also made vi sible to the male while she is speaking. Women who smoke cigarettes fi nd this tantalising wrist/palm exposure quite simple to perform while smoking. The exposed wrist and head toss gestures are often mimicked by homosexual males who want to take on a feminine appearance. Open Legs The legs are opened wider than they would normally have been if the male had not arrived on the scene. This occurs whether th e woman is sitting or standing and contrasts with the sexually defensive female who keeps her legs crossed and t ogether at all times. Rolling Hips The hips have an accentuated roll when walking to highlight the pelvic region. Some of the more subtle female courtship gestures that follow have been used for centuries in advertising to sell goods and services. Sideways Glance With partially dropped eyelids, the woma n holds the man’s gaze just long enough for him to notice, then she quickly looks away. This has the ta ntalising feeling of peeping and being peeped at and can light the fires of most normal men. Mouth Slightly Open, Wet Lips Dr Desmond Morris describes this as ‘sel fmimicry’ as it is in tended to symbolise the female genital region. The lips can be made to appear wet either by the use of saliva or cosmetics. Both give the woma n the appearance of sexual invitation.

It is one of the di splacement activities that people in today’s high-pressure society use to re lease the tensions that build up from social and business encounters. For example, most people experi ence inner tension while waiting outside the dentist’s surgery to have a tooth rem oved. While a smoker will cover up his anxiety by smoking, non-smokers perform other rituals such as grooming, nail biting, finger and foot tapping, cufflink adjusting, head scratching, taking a ring off and putting it back on, playing with a tie and demonstrating numerous other gestur es that tell us the person needs reassurance. Smoking gestures can play an important pa rt in assessing a pe rson’s attitude, as they are usually performed in a predictable, ritualistic manner that can give us important clues to th e person’s attitude. Pipe Smokers Pipe smokers perform a cleaning, lighti ng, tapping, filling, p acking and puffing ritual with their pipes and this is a very useful way to help relieve tension when they are under pressure. Sales research has shown that pipe smokers usually take longer to make a decision to buy than do cigarette smokers or non-smokers and that the pipe ritual is performed most often during the tense moments. of the sales interview. Pipe smokers, it seems, are people who like to stall d ecision-making and who can do so in an unobtrusive and socially acceptable way. If you want a quick decision from a pipe smoker, hide his pipe before the interview. Cigarette Smokers Like pipe smoking, cigarette smoking is a di splacement of inner tension and allows time to stall, but the cigarette smoker generally reaches his decision faster than the pipe smoker. The pipe smoker is, in effect, a ci garette smoker who need s more time to stall in making decisions than his cigarettes allo w. The cigarette ritu al involves tapping, twisting, flicking, waving and other mini-g estures indicating th at the person is experiencing more tension than may be normal. One particular signal indicates whether the person has a positive or negative attitude towards his circumstances; the di rection in which th e smoke is exhaled, whether it is up or down. A person who is f eeling positive, superior or confident will blow the smoke in an upward direction mo st of the time. Conversely, a person in a negative, secretive or suspicious frame of mind will blow the smoke down most of the time. Blowing down and from the corner of th e mouth indicates an even more negative or secretive attitude. This, of course, assumes that the sm oker is not blowing the smoke upwards to avoid offending others; in that case, he could have blown the smoke in either direction."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" In m o tion pictures, the leader of a m o torcyc le gang or crim inal syndicate is usually portray ed as a tough, ag gressiv e person who, as he sm okes, tilts his h e ad back sharp l y and with controlled precision blows the sm oke awards the ceiling to demonstrate his superiority to the rest of the gang. In cont rast, Hum phrey Bogart was often cast as a gangster or crim inal who always held his cigarette inverted in his hand and blew the sm oke own from the corner of his mouth as he f a nned a gaol break or other devious activ ity. The r e a l so app e ars to be a r e la tionship between ho w positiv e o r nega tive th e person feels and ie speed at which he or she exhales the poke. The faster the sm oke is blown upwards the m o re superior or confiden t the person feels; the faster it is b l own down, the more negative he feels. If a card player who is smoking is dealt a god hand, he is likely to blow the sm oke upwards, whereas a poor hand m a y cause hi m blow it downwards. Some card players see a ‘poker face’ when playing card s as a m e thod of not dis p laying any body signals that m a y give them away, while other player s like to be actors and use m i sleading body language to lull the other play ers into a false sens e of security. If, fo r example, a poker layer were dealt four aces a nd he wanted to bluff the othe r players, he could throw the cards face d o wn on the table in d i sgu s t and then curse, swear or fold his arm s and put on a non-verbal display that would indicate that he had been dealt a poor hand.

Observation of smoking gestures in selling shows that when a smoker is asked to buy, those who have reached a positive decision blow the smoke upwards, whereas th ose who have decided not to buy blow it downwards. The alert sales person, seeing the smoke being blow n downwards during the close of a sale could quick ly resell the customer on all the benefits he would receive by purchasing the product, to allow the cu stomer time to reconsider his decision. Blowing smoke out through the no strils is a sign of a superior, confident individual. The smoke is blown downwards only because of the physical location of the nostrils and the person often tilts his head back in a ‘looking down his nos e’ position. If the person’s head is down as he nose-blows the sm oke, he is angry and is trying to look ferocious, like an angry bull. Cigar Smokers Cigars have always been used as a means of displaying superiority because of their cost and size. The big-time business executive, the gang leader and people in high-status positions often sm oke cigars. Cigars are used to celebrate a victory or achievement such as the birth of a baby, a wedding, clinching a business deal or winning the lottery. It is not su rprising that most of the smoke exhaled by cigar smokers is upwards. I recently attended a celebration di nner where cigars were distributed freely and it was interesting to note that of 400 recorded cigar sm oke exhalations, 320 were in an upward direction. General Smoking Signals The continual tapping of a cigar or cigarett e end on the ashtray shows that an inner conflict is taking place and that you may need to reassure the smoker. Here, too, is an interesting smoking phenomenon. Most smok ers smoke their cigarette down to a certain length before extinguishing it in the ashtray. If the smoker lights a cigarette and suddenly extinguishes it earlier than he normally would, he has signalled his decision to terminate the conversation. Watching for this termination signal can allow you to take control or to close th e conversation, making it appear that it was your idea to end it. GESTURES WITH GLASSES Almost every artificial aid used by man gi ves its user an opportunity to perform many revealing gestures and this is certainly the case with those who wear glasses. One of the most common gestures is placing one arm of the frame in the mouth (Figure 127). Desmond Morris says that the act of putting objects against the lips or in the mouth is a momentary attempt by the person to relive the security he experienced as a baby at his mother’s breast, which means that gla sses-in-mouth is essentially a reassurance gesture. Smokers use their cigarettes for th e same reason, and the child sucks his thumb. Stalling Like pipe smoking, the glasses- in-mouth gesture can be used to stall or delay a deci- sion. In negotiating, it has been found that this gesture appears most frequently at the close of the discussion when the person ha s been asked for a decision. The act of continually taking the glasses off and clea ning the lenses is another method used by"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"glasses wearers to gain tim e for a decision. W h en this gesture is seen imm e diately after a decis i on h a s been ask e d for, silence is th e best tactic. The gesture s that f o llow this sta ll ges t ur e signal the person’s in tention and allow an alert negotiator to respon d acco rd ingly. For example, if the person puts the glasses b a c k on, this often m eans that he wants to ‘see’ the facts again, whereas folding the glasses and putting them a w ay signals an inte ntion to term inate the conversation. Peering Ov er Gla sses Actors in the m o tion pictures m a de dur ing the 1920sand 1930s used this peering gesture to p o rtray a c r itical or judgm e ntal person such as the m a ster of an English public school. Often the pers on may be wearing reading glasses and finds it m o re convenient to look over the tops, rather than rem oving them to look at the other person. Whoever is on the receiving end of this l ook m a y feel as though he is being judged or scrutinised. Looking over the glasses can be a very costly m i stak e, as the listener inevitably responds to this look with fold ed arm s , crossed legg y and a correspondingly negative attitude. Glasses wearers should re m ove them when speaking and put them back on to listen. This not only relaxes the other person but allows the glasses wearer to have control of the conversat ion. The listener quickly learns that when the glasses are off he m u st not interrupt the wearer, and when they are put back on he had better start talking."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"T w elve Territorial and Ownership Gestures TERRITORIAL GES T URES People lean against other people or objects to sho w a territorial claim to t h at object or person. L eaning can also be used as a m e thod, of dom ina n ce or intimidation when the object being leaned on belongs to som e one else. For example, if you are going to take a photograph of a friend and his new car, boat, hom e or other personal belonging, you will inevitab l y find that he leans agains t his newly acquired property , putting his foot on it or his arm around it (Figure 130). W h en he touc hes the property, it becom e s an extension of his body and in this way he shows others that it belongs to him . Young lovers continually hold hands or put their ar m s around one another in public and social situations to show others the claim that th ey have o n each other.

It has been noted that em ploy ees who have been newly appointed to m a nage m e nt positions suddenly begin to use th em , despite the fact that they seldom used them prior to their prom otion. It would be norm a l to assum e that the pos ition of the m a n in Figure 132 reflects an easygoing, relax e d and carefree attitud e , because that is in fact what it is. The leg-overchair gesture not only signifies the m a n’s ownership of that particular chair o r space, but also signals th at cus t om ary etiquettes m a y be relaxed. It is comm on to see two close friends seat ed lik e this, laugh in g and joking with each other, but let’s consider the im pact a nd m e aning of this gesture in different circum stanc e s. Take th is typical situ ation : an employee has a personal problem and he goes into the boss’s office to ask his advi ce on a possible solution. As the em ployee explain s , he leans forw ard in the chair, h i s hands on his knees, his f ace down and looking dejected and his tone of voice lo wered. The boss listens intently, sitting motionless, then suddenly leans back in his chair and puts one leg over the arm . In these circum stanc e s the boss ’ s attitud e has change d to lack o f concern or indif f e ren ce because of h i s carefree g e sture. In other word s, h e has little con cern for th e em ployee or his problem and he m a y even feel that his time is being wasted with the ‘s am e old story’. A further question needs to be answered: what is the boss indifferent about? He m a y have considered the em ployee’s problem , decided that it’s not really a m a jor one and he m a y even have becom e uninterested in or indifferent towards the em ployee. W h ile he rem a ins in the leg-over-chair position, he will probably have a concerned look o n his face throughout the discussion to cover up his lack of inter e st. He m a y even ter m inate the discussion by telling his em ployee that he need not worry and that the problem will sim p ly go away. W h en the em ployee leaves the office, the boss m a y breathe a sigh of relief and say to him s elf, ‘Thank heavens he’s gone!’ and take his leg off th e chair. If the boss’s chair has no arm s (which is unlikely; this is usually the visitor’s chair) he m a y be seen with one or both feet on the de sk (Figure 133). If his superior enters the office, it is unlikely that the boss would use such an obvious territorial/ownership gesture, but would resort to m o re subtle ve rsions such as putting his foot on the bottom drawer of his desk, or, if there are no drawer s in the desk, placing his foot hard agains t the leg of th e desk to s t a k e his c l aim to it."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"These gestures can be quite annoying if they occur during negotiation, and it is vital that the person should change to a different position because the l onger he stays in the leg-ove r-ch a ir or f e e t -on - desk positio n, the long er he will h a ve an indif f e re nt or hos tile attitude.

This ‘carbon copying’ is a m eans by which one person tells the other th at he is in agre em ent with his id eas an d attitud e s. By this m e thod, one is non-verbally saying to the other, ‘As you can see, I think the sam e as you, so I will copy your pos ture and gestures.’ This unconscious m i m i cry is qu ite in teres t ing to observe. Take for example, th e two m e n standing at the hotel bar in Figure 134. They have m i rrored each other’s gestures and it is reasonable to assum e that they ar e discussing a topic upon which they have the sam e thoughts and feelings.

This has the effect of putting th e other person in a receptiv e and relaxed fra m e of m i nd, as he can ‘see’ that you understand his point of view (Figure 135). When I was selling insurance I found this a very effective technique for a ‘cold ’ prospective custom er. I deliberately copied each m ovem e nt the p r ospective cu stom er m a de until I felt I had es tablished a s t rong enoug h rapport to allow the presentation to proceed. Invariably, if the pr ospect began copying m y gest ures, a sale would result. However, before copying the other person’ s gestures when ne gotiating, it is vital that your relationship with that person be ta ken into co nsidera tion. Let’s say, f o r exam ple, that the junio r clerk of a large corporation has asked for a pay rise and is called into the m a nager’s office. As he walk s in, the m a nager asks him to sit down and then assum e s a superiority T-cross gesture (F igure 96) and a figure 4 leg lock (Figure 81) while h e lean s bac k in h i s ch a i r to show the clerk his s uperior, dom i nant and com p etitive attitud e .

If the boss sits with a hands-behind-head T-cross gesture (Figure 96), his subordinates will copy. People who sell to married couples in their home are well advised to watch the couple’s gestures, to see who initiat es the gestures and who follows.

Unfortunately, little can be done to help pe ople becom e taller or shorter, so let us explore som e useful applications of height. It is possible to avoid intim idating othe rs by consciously ma king yourself appear sm aller in relation to them, so let us exam in e the non-verbal aspects of the situation in which you have been speeding in your car and are stopped by the police. In these circum stances, the officer m a y regard you as an adversary as he approaches your vehicle, and a driv er’s us ual reaction is to rem a in in the car, wind the wind ow down and m a ke excuses for hav i n g exceed ed the speed lim it. The nonverbal neg a tives of this behaviour are: (1) The officer is forced to l eave his territory (the patrol car) and come across to your territory (your vehicle). (2) Assum i ng that you have in fact broken the speed lim it, your excuses m a y represent an a ttack to the officer. (3) By rem a ining in your car, you create a barrier be tween yourself and the policem an. Considering that under these circumstances the police officer is obviously in a superior position to you, this type of behaviour only serves to m a ke things go from bad to worse and your chances of being booked ar e increased. Instead, try this if you are flagged down: (1) Get immediately out of your car (your territory) and go over to the police officer’s car (h is territory ). In this way he is not inconvenienced by having to leave his territory. (2) S t oop your body over so that you are sm aller than he is.

When this tech nique is used as dir ected, it can save you from being booked more than 50 per cent of the time. The same technique can be used to calm an irate customer who is returning some faulty goods to a retail store. In this case, the counter represents a barrier between the store owner and the customer. Control of an irate customer would be difficult if the storekeeper remained on his own side of the counter, and this staking-out of territory would make the customer angrier. The best approach would be for the storekeeper to come around to the customer’s side of the counter with his body stooped over and palms visible and to use the same techni que as was used with the police officer. Interestingly, there are some circumstan ces under which lowering the body can be a dominance signal. This is where you slouch dow n and make yourself comfortable in an easy chair in another person’s home while the owner is standing. It is the complete in- formality on the other person’s territory th at communicates the dominant or aggressive attitude.

ANGLES AND T R IANGLES Open Formation In an earlier chapter, we stated that the physical dist ance between people is related to their degree of intim acy. The angle at wh ich people orient their bodies also gives m a ny non-verbal clues to their attitudes and relationships. For exam ple, people in m o s t English speaking countries stand w ith their bo dies oriented to form a n angle of 90 degrees during ordinary social intercourse . Figure 140 shows two m e n with their bodies angled towards an im aginary third point to fo rm a triang le. This also se rves as a no n- verbal invitation for a third person to join in the conversation by standing at the third point. The two m e n in Figure 140 are disp laying sim ilar status by holding sim ilar gestures and posture and the ang l e fo rm ed by their torsos ind i cates tha t an im personal conversation is probably taking place.

Closed Formation When intimacy or privacy is required by two people, the angle form ed by their torsos decreases from 90 degrees down to 0 degrees. A m a n wishing to attract a fem a le partner uses this ploy, as well as other courtship gestures, when he m a kes his play for her. Not only does he point his body towards her, but he also closes the distanc e between th em as he m o ves into her intim a te zone.

This technique lets B feel involved in the c onversation and is partic ularly useful if you need to have B on side with you. Foot Pointing Not only do the feet serve as pointers, indicating the direction in which a person would like to go, but they are also used to point at people who are interesting or attractive.

The Co-operative Position (B2) When two people are m u tually oriented, that is, both thinking alike or working on a task togeth e r , th is po sition usually occurs. It is one of the most strategic positions for presenting a case and h a v i ng it accepted. The tric k is, however, f o r B to be able to tak e this position without A feeling as though his territory has been invaded. T h is is also a highly successful position to take when a thir d party is introduced into th e negotiatio n by B, the sales person.

Only 10 per cent of the patients were perceived to be at ease when the doctor’s desk was present and the doctor sat behind it. This figure incr eased to 55 per cent when the desk was absent. If B is seeking to persuade A, the co mpetitive-defensive position reduces the chance of a successful negotiation unless B is deliberately sitting oppos ite as part of a pre-planned strategy. For example, it may be that A is a manager who must severely reprimand employee B, and the competitive position can strengthe n the reprimand. On the other hand, it may be necessary for B to ma ke A feel superior and so B deliberately sits directly opposite A. Whatever line of business you are in, if it involves dealing with people, you are in the influencing business and your objective should always be to see the other person’s point of view, to put him or her at ease a nd make him or her feel right about dealing with you; the competitive position does not l ead towards this end. More co-operation will be gained from the corner and co-ope rative positions than will ever be achieved from the competitive position. Conversations ar e shorter and more specific in this position than from any other. Whenever people sit directly opposite each other across a table, they unconsciously divide it into two equal territories. Each clai ms half as his own territory and will reject the other’s encroaching upon it. Two people seat ed competitively at a restaurant table will mark their territorial boundaries with the salt, pepper, sugar bowl and napkins. Here is a simple test that you can conduct at a restaurant which demonstrates how a person will react to invasion of his territory. I recently took a salesman to lunch to offer him a contract with our company. We sat at a small rectangular re staurant table which was too small to allow me to take the co mer position so I was forced to sit in the competitive position. The usual dining items were on the table: ashtray, salt and pepper shakers, napkins and a menu. I picked up the menu, read it, and then pushed it across in to the other man’s territory. He picked it up, read it, and then pl aced it back in the centre of the table to his right. I then picked it up again, read it, and placed it back in his territory. He had been leaning forward at this point and this subt le invasion made him sit back. The ashtray was in the middle of the table and, as I ashed my cigarette, I pushed it into his territory. He then ashed his own cigarette and pushed th e ashtray back to the centre of the table once again. Again, quite casually, I ashed my cigarette and pushed the ashtray back to his side. I then slowly pushed the sugar bowl from the middle to his side and he began to show discomfort. Then I pushed the salt and pepper shakers across the centre line. By this time, he was squirming around in his seat as though he was sitting on an ant’s nest and a light film of sweat began to form on his brow. When I pushed the napkins across to his side it was all too much and he excu sed himself and went to the toilet. On his return, I also excused myself. When I return ed to the table I f ound that all the table items had been pushed back to the centre line!

Let us exam ine the factors that can bu ild a posi tive atm o sphere, discuss their origin and potential an d exam ine the backgr ound of m a n’s feeding behaviour. Anthropologists tell us that m a n’s origin wa s that of a tree-dwe ller who was strictly vegetarian, his diet consisti ng of roots, leaves, berries, fruit and the like. About a m illion years ago, he cam e out of the trees ont o the plains to becom e a hunter of prey. Prior to his becom i ng a land dweller, m a n’s eating habits were those of the m onkeys - involving continual nibbling throughout the day. Each i ndividual was entirely responsible for his own survival and for obtaining his own food. As a hunter, however, he needed the co-operation of other indi vid u als to cap ture larg e prey, so large co-operative hunting groups were form ed. E ach group would leave at sunrise to hunt throughout the day and return at dusk with the day’s spoils . These were then divided equally am ong the hunters, who w ould eat inside a communal cave. At the en trance to the cave a fire was li t to ward off dangerous anim als and to provide warm th. Each cavem an sat with his ba ck again s t the wall of the cave to avo i d the possibility of being attacked from behi nd while he was engrossed in eating his m eal. The only sounds that were heard w e re th e gnashing and gnawing of teeth and the crackle of the fire. This ancient process of food sharing at dusk around an open fire was the beginning of a social ev ent that modern m a n re-enact s in the form of barbecues, cookouts and dinner parties. Modern m a n also reacts and behaves at these events in much the sam e way as he did over a m illion years ago. Now to our restaurant or di nner party. A positive decision in your favour is easier to obtain when your prospect is relaxed, free of tension and his or her defensive barriers have been lowered.

Tension is further increased if the person’s back is toward s an open door or a wi ndow at ground level. Next, the lights should be dimmed and muffled background music played. Many top restaurants have an open fireplace or facsimile near the entrance of the restaurant to recreate the fire that burned at the ancient cave feasts. It would be best to use a round table and to have your prospect’s view of other people obscured by a screen or large green plant if you are to have a captive audience. It is far easier to obtain a favourable de cision under these circumstances than it will ever be in restaurants that have bright li ghting, tables and chairs placed in open areas and the banging of plates, knives and fork s.

Where the inte rviewer seemed so big and overwhelming and you felt small and insignificant? It is likely that the interviewer had cunningly arranged his office furnishings to rais e his own status and power a nd, in so doing, to lower yours. Certain strategies using chairs and seating ar rangements can create this atmosphere in an office. The factors involved in raising status and pow er by using chairs ar e: the size of the chair and its accessories, the height of the chair from the floor and the location of the chair relative to the other person. Chair Size and Accessories The height of the back of the chair raises or lowers a person’s status and the high-backed chair is a well- known example. The higher the back of the chair, the greater the power and status of the person sitti ng in it. Kings, queens, popes and other high-status people may have the back of thei r throne or official chair as high as 250 centimetres (over 8 feet) to show their status relative to their subjects; the senior executive has a high-backed leather chair and his visitor’s chair has a low back. Swivel chairs have more power and status than fixed chairs, allowing the user freedom of movement when he is placed under pressure. Fixed chairs allow little or no movement and this lack of m ovement is compensated by body gestures that can reveal a person’s attitudes and feelings. Chairs with arm rests, thos e that lean back and those that have wheels are better than chairs that have not. Chair Height The acquisition of power using height was covered in Chapter 14 but it is worth noting that status is gained if your chair is adjusted higher off the floor than the other person’s. Some advertising executives are know n for sitting on high-backed chairs that are adjusted for maximum height while their visitors sit opposite, in the competitive position, on a sofa or chair that is so low that their eyes are level with the executive’s desk (Figure 162). A common ploy is to have th e ashtray just out of the visitor’s reach, which forces him to be inconvenienced when ashing his cigarette. Chair Location As mentioned in the chapte r on seating arrangements, th e most power is exerted on the visitor when his chair is placed in the competitive position. A common power play is to place the visitor’s chair as far away as possible from the executive’s desk into the social or public territory zone, which further reduces the visitor’s status."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" STRATEG IC OFFICE LAYOUT Having read this book, you should now be able to arrange your office furniture in such a way as to have as much power, status or control over others as you wish.

John’s desk was placed in fron t o f th e glass p a rtition, m a king his office appear bigger and allowing him to be visibl e to those who entered his office. 2. The ‘hot seat’ was placed in the com e r position, m a king communication m o re open and allowing the corner to act as a par tia l b a rrier when necessary. 3. The glass partition was spray e d with a m i rror finish, allowing John to s e e out, but not perm itting others to see in. This rais ed John ’s sta t us and crea ted a m o re in tim ate atm o sphere within his office. 4. A round coffee table with thre e identical swivel chairs wa s placed at the other end of the office to allow inform al m eetings to tak e p l ace on an e qual lev e l."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"5. In the original layout (Figur e 163), John’s desk gave half the table territory to the visitor and the revised layout (Figure 164) ga ve John complete claim to the desk top. 6. John practised relaxed open arms and legs gestures combined with frequent palm gestures when speaking with subordinates in his office. The result was that supervisor/employee relationships improved and the employees began describing John as an easygoing and relaxed supervisor. STATUS RAISERS Certain objects strategi cally placed around the office can be subtly used non-verbally to increase the st atus and power of the occupa nt. Some examples include: 1. Low sofas for visitors to sit on. 2. A telephone with a lock on it. 3. An expensive ashtray placed out of th e reach of the visitor, causing him inconvenience when ashing his cigarette. 4. A cigarette container from overseas. 5. Some red folders left on the desk marked ‘Strictly Confidential’. 6. A wall covered with photos, awards or qualifications that the occupant has received. 7. A slim briefcase with a combination loc k. Large, bulky briefcases are carried by those who do all the work. All that is needed to raise your status, increase your power and effectiveness with others is a little t hought given to non-verb al gymnastics in your office or home. Un- fortunately, most executive offices are arranged like the one in Fi gure 163; rarely is consideration given to the negative non-verbal signals that are unwittingly communicated to others. We suggest that you study your own office layout and use the preceding information to make the positive changes needed. "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Eighteen Putting It All Together Communication through body language has been going on for over a million years but has only been scientifically studied to any extent in the last twenty years or so; it became popular during the 1970s. By the end of this century it will have been ‘discovered’ by people throughout the world a nd I predict that its impact and meaning in human communication will be part of formal education. This book has served as an introduction to body language and I encourag e you to seek further knowledge through your own research and experience and through the examples given. Ultimately, society will be your best research and testing ground. Conscious observation of your own actions and those of others is the best way for each person to gain a better understanding of the communication methods of the earth’s most complex and interesting beast - man himself. The remainder of this book is devoted to social and business situations and shows how gestures and body signals occur in cluste rs and the circumstances that may affect your interpretation. However, before you read the notes, study each picture sequence and see how many you can interpret through wh at you have read in this book. You will be amazed to find how much your perceptiveness has improved. Clusters, Circumstances and Gestures in Daily Encounters Figure 165 A good example of an openness cluste r. The palms are fully exposed in the submissive position and the fingers are spread wide to give more impact to the gesture. The head is in the neutral position a nd the arms and legs are apart. This man is communicating a submissive, non-threatening attitude. Figure 166 This is a classic deceit cluster. As he rubs his eye he looks away towards the floor and both eyebrows are ra ised to the disbelief position. His head is turned away and down, showing a negative attitude. He also has an insincere, tight-Tipped smile. Figure 167 Inconsistency of gestures is obvious here. The man is smiling confidently as he crosses the room but one hand has crossed his body to play with his watch and form a partial arm ba rrier which shows that he is unsure of himself and/or his circumstances.
