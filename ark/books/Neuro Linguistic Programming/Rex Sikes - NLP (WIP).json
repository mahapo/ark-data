The Basics and Beyond Congratulations! You have taken the first step toward gaining more control over your emotions, your thoughts, your communication and your life. Today, when living day to day seems to be overly complicated and where time and information compete, we need new skills in order to just keep up and make our dreams a reality. The Ultimate Neuro Linguistic Programming Course TM is a course about working with the greatest device known to mankind: the human mind. This program is approximately 42 hours in length and was edited from over 140 hours of a live IDEA Seminars' NLP Practitioner Training. While this home study program is comprehensive, it is not a substitute for live training. Live training allows you to gain the most skill because of the immediate feedback from the trainer and other students. In addition, training with IDEA Seminars is an intense experiential environment where your learning can blossom to its fullest potential. For best results, read and follow the instruction sheet that is located inside your audio tape albums. Our recommendation is to watch the video tape first, then begin listening to the audio cassettes. Use this manual as a reference to look up topics, when you come across them on the tapes. The manual also is great to read cover-to-cover as well! For best results, listen to the audio tapes in the comfort of your own home. WARNING! Do NOT listen to the relaxation exercises and closed-eye exercises while driving. Also, this set contains two relaxation tapes - The Attitude Activator and the Guided Visualization tape. AVOID LISTENING TO THEM WHILE DRIVING OR OPERATING HEAVY MACHINERY. In this program, you will be exposed to an intense amount of material and exercises which utilize and challenge the rich resources of your mind. It is carefully designed to harness your unconscious mind to learn at an accelerated speed many times faster than what you may be used to. Just follow along and have a good time. Allow yourself to relax and learn to gain the most from this program. Since Rex teaches at multiple levels, repeated listening will increase your comprehension. Subsequent listenings will allow you to notice elements and patterns you did not notice the first time through. The most important commitment you can make to yourself is to thoroughly enjoy yourself, relax, and have FUN, allowing the program to guide you in transforming the way you think, feel and live. This is your time to really stretch and reach new levels of joy in your life and to enrich the lives of those around you. Special Thanks Special thanks to the IDEA Seminars employees and interns for their tireless dedication and commitment to serving our customers and the contribution of their time, patience, and love. This program would not be possible without them. We also want to thank the Macintosh developers for their incredible products, the Canon Copier people and the island of Jamaica for their fine coffee - for making our lives and our jobs simpler, more productive, enjoyable and efficient.

He appeared before millions on a national NBC talk show where he assisted a \"warring\" couple resolve their conflicts and renew their love. He has worked with attorneys in a major trial in the U.S. and can often be heard on local TV and radio doling out his expert advice on subjects ranging from business persuasion to love relationships. His knowledge, skill, background, and most importantly his commitment to teaching you make him an experience you will talk about for a lifetime. Rex began doing public appearances by the age of six, becoming a professional magician by eight years old. At fifteen, he joined a church and began doing ministry work taking him to foreign countries. He headed for Hollywood at eighteen where he worked as an actor and stand up comedian. While in California, Rex also studied under eastern religious masters like Rajneesh, Muktananda, Krishnamirti and Zen masters. When Rex discovered NLP in the late seventies, he was astounded with the practical real world applications. After reading \"Frogs into Princes\", he was convinced that he was going to make it his lifelong career. A few years later, he was working closely with the developers of NLP, and was honored as the first person on the planet to be certified to train and present the DHE Certification training. When he is not training with IDEA Seminars, Rex does customized business consulting, executive coaching and expert modeling. Some of his clients include attorneys, CEO's, sales managers, personnel managers, small business owners, training personnel, investors, teachers and educational administrators."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"IDEA Seminars, Inc . IDEA Seminars was founded by Rex Steven and Carolyn Sikes in 1991 to provide an opportunity for high quality NLP training for everyone, not only therapists. We have been successful in teaching people (including therapists) the methodology of NLP, not just therapeutic techniques, so that our students can immediately apply their new skills to their work and life. IDEA is a learning organization, which means that we learn from our participants as well! Each time we do a program, we get better and better. Our very first practitioner program bears little resemblance to the program we put on today, because of the wealth of new learning we get from our students! Our commitment to you and our unrelenting desire to continually develop new training systems make us the very best and most progressive place to come for training in Neuro Linguistic Programming. One of the most unique benefits to training with us is our energetic, fun and invigorating training environment. Learning that is fun and active, like when we were children, is quicker and longer lasting than boring, passive learning. Our training system is heavily customized to each group of participants. There is no pre-written presentation by the trainers so you will not be subjected to the dry, boring, yawn-inducing talks that occur at so many courses. To help you learn easily and comfortably, all of our trainers are hand-picked by Rex Steven Sikes, and all are top experts in their field. To provide you with the best training available, you will find a number of unique characteristics of our training program: 1. You will always have one main trainer presenting the entire course. Guest trainers and assistants are used, but you will always have one trainer present throughout the program. One main trainer is important because then he can adjust to group needs. He will spend more time on one subject, and less on another depending upon the group's speed. 2. Throughout the training, you will be involved in various mild physical exercises. Since the mind and the body are a part of the same cybernetic system, it is very important to get the body involved in the learning process so that the skills become a part of your natural behavior. It is also important to get the body involved to facilitate good energy states conducive to a learning environment. 3. NLP is about adding more choices, not taking choices away. To this end, you will experience a critical approach to NLP, rather than a dogmatic, rule-structured approach. We do not claim to teach “truths\" or expect you to adhere to the concepts blindly. Our primary emphasis is developing self-awareness and choice. We teach you to evaluate the results, and use what is working, rather than accepting a particular concept as “correct\" or \"the only way\". 4. Self -change/personal growth is emphasized, rather than therapeutic techniques. NLP is famous for particular therapeutic techniques. Unfortunately, many of the techniques are designed to be performed by a therapist on a client. Many people want to make changes in their own lives rather than learn to do a technique on someone else. Realizing this, IDEA Seminars has developed a training design, known as Mind Design TM, that allows our students to learn NLP in the context of self -development and self-change, as well as learning to do techniques with others. Mind Design Mind Design TM is about learning to learn. The classes involve accelerated learning (Brain-based learning) methods resulting from the culmination of research into learning conducted by Rex Steven Sikes. All IDEA Seminars' training programs are run through the Mind Design TM method to get students to transfer the skills more dramatically and successfully to their everyday lives.

We learn about a city from being there, not from a map or guide book. We learned to walk and talk without reading instructions or following recipes. I encourage you to JUMP IN with all your energy and you will learn more. Learning is a doing something, then getting rid of the unwanted parasitic movements (extra, un-needed movements). Parasitic movements are reduced through practice and time as your learning streamlines. And have a lot of fun and laughs while you learn. Keeping a positive state is very important for absorption. The Framework of Mind Design Luck is the crossroads where opportunity and preparedness meet. Notice it, Own it, Play with it, Stay with it (NOPS) Howard Gardner talks about our 7 intelligence's - Linguistic, Mathematical (Logical), Kinesthetic (Bodily), Intrapersonal, Interpersonal, Spatial and Musical. Harvard University did a study using Polarized glass (glasses which invert the images we see). After a few hours of wear, the subjects could see normally. The brain compensated for the inverted image. They removed the glasses and the real world images were inverted. 90% of seeing occurs behind the eye. JUMP IN with all your energy and you will learn more. Learning is a doing something, then getting rid of the unwanted parasitic movements (extra, un-needed movements). Parasitic movements are reduced through practice and time. Dr. George Solomon of California State University demonstrated that the hypothalamus (limbic system) effects the immune system. Incisions cut into the hypothalamus suppressed the immune system. The hypothalamus effects endocrine production in our body. (Hypothalamus/limbic systems identified as the seat of emotions and subconscious reaction). The Ground rules: play, participate, experience. Brain 37% of oxygen -- so when learning remember to breath deeply and drink lots of water. When you don't breath, you release adrenaline and go into fight/flight response. Control issues: If you want to be in control, know that you cannot stay un-confused and learn. Frustration = confusion with a different interpretation on it. Brain is a muscle - must exercise it or it won't develop more than what is needed. Your mind is like a tree that grows -- it is not like a jar to be filled. Mark Twain \"I never let my schooling interfere with my education.\" Glen Dowman \"The brain has infinite capacity. The more you put into it the more it will hold. The human brain grows the way biceps do. Every time we use visualization, the ability to visualize expands.\" Patricia Durovy of ASTD \"90% of all communication is unconscious and experts determine that the estimation may be low.\" Harvard University's Dr. Becher research pain and placebo. He found morphine worked in 52% of the cases and the placebo worked in 40% of the cases. Thus the placebo was 75% as effective as morphine."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Professor Wilson Key \"An individual who wants to utilize a greater part of his brain-stored information must simply learn how to move information from the unconscious into the conscious level of cognition.\" The key to using our natural capacity must be to \"circumvent the conscious control systems that we erect during our formal schooling and allow the greater subconscious capacities to be used.\" Some of the theoretical background Maintaining high expectations of the student's potential is important because the brain has a near infinite capacity for neural connections. Professor Peter Kouzmich Anokhin of Moscow University says that the brain is composed of ten billion neurons. He says that each neuron can make nearly infinite connections (one with twenty-eight noughts after it). \"If a single neuron has this quality of potential, we can hardly imagine what the whole brain can do...\" A linear, sequential, \"chunked-down\", piece-by-piece presentation is actually boring to the brain . Instead, the brain prefers multiple inputs. According to Caine and Caine , the brain is a multi-processor and designed specifically to receive multiple inputs at once. Botella and Eriksen confirm this notion of parallel processing. \"All people learn through random, personalized, complex real life patterns that defy description except in the most reductionist terms.\" Francis Crick, the Nobel prize winning scientist who co-discovered the DNA's double helix formation, suggests that the brain functions \"are usually massively parallel.” Caine, Renate Nummela and Geoffrey Caine.

Human Brain and Human Learning. White Plains, New York: Longman Publishing, 1983 Students should physically move - dance, exercise, cross-crawling - as part of their learning experience . Kandel and Hawkins report that manipulating the digits resulted in increased brain size and increased connections in the brains of monkeys. Kandel, E. and R. Hawkins \"The Biological Basis of learning and Individuality.\" Scientific American Sept. 1992: 79-86. Richard Restak says \"For the first time in human history, we will be in a position to design our own brain\". A climate of fun and laughter effects learning and memory positively. When people laugh and have fun, they release chemicals in the brain that affect learning in a positive way. According to the research of McNamara and Skelton, there is a specific neurochernical basis for learning and memory. Stanford researcher, Bandura notes that there is a biochemical difference in the body when a person is confident and optimistic. The presenter's job is to assist students in deliberately releasing those chemicals thought emotional release, physical movement and a positive attitude. In other words, the teacher's job is not to teach, but to provide an environment that is conducive to learning. Paul MacLean says that our hormones, feelings and emotions affect our learning. O'Keefe and Nadel were instrumental in establishing the role of the hippocampus in emotions and learning and suggested that positive emotions allow the brain to manufacture better cognitive maps. In other words, when we feel good we can learn better and enhance our memory. Hooper and Teresi documented the work of Dr. James McGaugh who says, \"Arousal causes all these chemical cocktails--norepinephine, adrenaline, enkephalin, vasopressin, ACTH to sprits out. We think these chemicals are memory fixatives... they signal the brain, This is important, keep this!.\" Dr. William Fry from Stanford University"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"discovered that an increase in white blood cell activity and changes in the chemical balance of the blood is associated with laughter. He further asserts that this blood activity may be there to boost the body's production of neurotransmitters needed for alertness and memory.

A student's attitude toward learning is the most important predictor for a successful learning outcome . If the student considers learning fun and exciting, the outcome will be positive. Travis Air Force Base did a study of 152 cancer patients and their treatments and they demonstrated that \"attitude toward treatment was a better predictor of response to treatment than was the severity of the disease.\" Mastery of language patterns and positive encouragement are the keys for successful training. Kotulak and Dr. Lewis Baxter have shown that words can be just as powerful as prescription drugs - that carefully chosen words can actually engage the healing system. Kotulak, Ronal. \"Unraveling Hidden Mysteries of the Brain.\" Chicago Tribune 11-16 April 1993 Learning new things causes you to stay young and live a more healthy life. In his studies, Jean-Francois Dartigues states that those most likely to remain young and mentally facile were NOT those who had that highest formal education, but those who had the most intellectually stimulating careers. In other words -- use your brain or loose it. In fact, research suggests that those who continue to learn new behaviors, accept challenges and solve puzzles remain younger and more facile longer than those who don't. Dartigues, Jean-Francois. \"Use It or Lose 17” Omni Feb. 1994:34 Happiness is a left brain function. When you feel good and think positively, it is a left brain function. (Maybe this is why many people who have over-developed right brains like artists and creative people are often prone to depression.) Yale researchers, in 1987 (reported by McGuire), demonstrate that when the subject was feeling optimistic about life, the PET scans of the left hemisphere showed the most activity. The right side of the brain \"lit up\" when the subjects felt depressed, negative or stressed. Maguire, J. Care and Feeding of the Brain. New York: Doubleday, 1990 Human beings learn by making connections amidst confusion. Confusing is a valuable learning tool. Leslie Hart states that learning is the extraction of meaningful patterns for the confusion. Hart says that one of the abilities of the neocortex is to detect patterns and create patterns. Furthermore, the brain recognizes patterns in a gestalt format, NOT in a digital (1+1=2) format. G. Edelman supports this by saying, \"learning in any species results from the operation of neural linkages between global mappings and value centers.\" In other words, we learn by figuring things out, detecting patterns, and finally - making connections. Edelman, G. Bright Air, Brilliant Fire, New York: Basic Books, 1992 Hart, Leslie. Human Brain and Human Learning. White Plains, New York: Longman Publishing, 1983 Most learning occurs unconsciously. Dr. Emile Donchin of the University of Illinois"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"states that 99% of all learning is non-conscious. In addition, Pfurtscheller and Berghold discovered that your brain has already signaled parts of your body to respond two seconds before an actual activity. This means that most of the time, we act before we think (consciously). Thus, the environment is the most important area of concern for a teacher/trainer. Setting up an environment that is conducive for learning rather than a planned rigid format will allow the students to learn quickly and comfortably. Pfurtscheller, G. and A. Berghold. \"Patterns of Cortical Activation During Planning of Voluntary Movement.\" Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology. 72 (1989): 250-58. Searching for reasons is not the best way to produce the results you want.

It enables students to access those parts of the brain previously inaccessible to them and can be used with students of every age. Cross-crawling assists in spelling, writing, listening, reading and comprehension. It also improves left/right coordination, breathing and stamina, coordination and spatial awareness, hearing and vision. Statistical research has shown that movement, especially those that cross the body's lateral midline, have positive effects on learning. Cross-crawling has been discovered to stimulate, release and relax students, as well as assist them move through learning blocks. Contralateral movements are effective because they stimulate the receptive as well as the expressive hemispheres of the brain, facilitating integrated learning, according to Paul E. Dennison, Ph.D., author of Brain Gym. Cross-Crawl Exercises Basically, any movement where you alternately move one arm with its opposite leg and the other arm and its opposite leg is a cross-crawl exercise. Exercise 1 Alternatively touch each hand to the opposite knee. Exercise 2 Reaching behind the body, alternatively touch each hand to the opposite heel. Exercise 3 - \"The Freddy\" \"The Freddy\" is similar to an old disco dance.

The Long Definition NLP is a completely unique synthesis of cybernetics, neurology, and linguistics that offers you practical methods for rapid personal improvement. When you learn NLP, you will discover easy to follow road maps that lead you to enriched personal achievement and interpersonal and professional influence. Literally millions of people from all walks of life have used NLP principles and techniques to change their own behavior patterns and influence others more effectively. The study of human behavior is one of the few areas that for the most part continues to operate from outmoded theories and information. In contrast, NLP is a technology that brings us into the modern world, a technology that can be used to create the quality of life you want right now! NLP is not about quick fixes. In fact one of the assumptions in the field is that \"people are not broken so they do not need to be fixed”. Instead, we believe that people have all the resources needed to make any change. NLP is about uncovering untapped resources within people. You may notice how different this is from today's pop psychology messages that tell people that they are ‘wounded' somehow and that they need to recover for a long, long time. Most psychologists still believe that change has to be long, hard and painful. After too many years of Freudian psychology, repression, pillow beating, unconscious-as-evil, primal scream therapy, wounded inner child work, critical parent/child/adult therapy and group therapy, it is no wonder! All these therapies really had tremendous potential, they just paid too much attention to the problem and not enough on how the person used their brain systematically when they created the problem. In our culture, there isn't much emphasis placed on purposefully using your brain to direct your life in the way you want it to go. What if you were to deliberately design the inside of your mind and fill it up with wonderful things? This is the premise of NLP: instead of filling up your mind re-living old painful times, why not fill your mind with wonderful things! Modeling Excellence - The History of NLP The field of NLP grew from what its two founders learned from the mental processes of \"exceptional\" people: therapists who created profound changes in their patients such as renown family therapist Virginia Satir, Milton Erickson MID, (the grandfather of Hypnotherapy) and Fritz Pearls (the father of Gestalt therapy), as well as from people who had recovered from phobias, terminal illness and life's tragedies, entrepreneurs and salespeople. NLP grew from thousands of people who were able to transform their lives in dramatic and positive ways. In the early 1970s co-founders Richard Bandler and John Grinder, at the University of Santa Cruz, California, engaged in the study of people who were able to achieve powerful"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"results. They asked \"can we determine what processes occur inside the brain that allow these people great successes and can we teach those processes to others so that they too can get the same kind of consistent results?\" The answer is decidedly \"yes\". They asked a question which leads to excellence. \"What is it that these people do inside their head that gets them excellent outcomes?\". This is a very different question than those asked by most academic theoreticians and most practicing therapists -- \"What's wrong?\" and \"How can I fix it?\". Instead of asking what is wrong, or at what time in a person’s life did something go wrong, they asked \"what is right?\". They created NLP based on modeling what works - people who got over phobias - not by studying the people who had them. In NLP, we use formulas for success -- models and not theories. A theory is an explanation a person gives as to “why” something is the case. A model, like a model car or steam engine, either works or it doesn't. A model is evaluated by its usefulness whereas a theory is evaluated by its reasonableness. This difference in research orientation and practitioner orientation still exists today. Unfortunately, most professionals still look for problems and theories. Instead, an NLP Practitioner looks for solutions and what can be done. How To Use Your Brain On Purpose You and I use our brain and we communicate to others everyday. Neuro Linguistic Programming is the science and art of how we use our brain to communicate with ourselves and with other people. Neuro means our neurology, our nervous systems, and our ability to take in information through our five senses and translate that into usable information within our nervous system. Linguistic refers to the verbal and nonverbal language we use to communicate with ourselves as well as others. Programming comes from computer terminology. It means that just as we can reliably program a computer to engage in tasks or computing behaviors which we want, so we can use the computer between our ears to program in behaviors we want more of and eliminate those behaviors which stand in our way. So NLP is the science of using your brain, your language and your behavior to get what you want. NLP is like a new way of looking at learning; an education process that makes available to you infinite possibilities for learning and changing. Basically, it's developing new ways to teach people how to use their brain deliberately and on purpose. Since the introduction of NLP twenty years ago we have seen heard and felt the influence all around us. NLP has improved our health by providing us with ways to change our beliefs about ourselves. NLP has changed how we sold things by learning how prospects make decisions, creating instant rapport and using persuasive language. NLP has seeped"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"into our advertising, our government, our political campaigns, our self help books tapes and seminars, our computer programs, our schools, even our religions. It is everywhere. NLP is the study of subjective experience. NLP is the study of how our experience is made and what our experience is made up of. Science tells us our experience is determined from our five sense. And Neuro Linguistic Programming tells us \"it is how we use those senses, and in what order\". Just as we string letters of the alphabet together to make words, and we string words together to make sentences and sentences together to make paragraphs -- we string our mental pictures, sounds and feeling together to make a moment and we string those together to make an event and those events together to make up our life story. And then we look at, talk about or feel those moments in very specific ways. The way in which we string things together and the connections that we make, is the cause for our talents and our limitations. This process of creating our reality is what we call making our personal map or model of the world. Each of us has a different way of interacting with the world and therefor a different map or world view. In other words, at the neurological level we shape what we think the world is like and we act from what we have created. Premature Cognitive Commitment In psychology, there is the concept called Premature Cognitive Commitment. What this means is that we operate out of automatic, habitual behaviors -- cognitive structures that we've developed by learning and growing. The way that you test this is that you get a big, five-gallon jar, and you put in a bunch of flies. And then you put plastic wrap over the top. There will be enough air in it for the flies to live if you leave it there for about forty-eight hours. These flies will continue to buzz around and they'll bang up against the plastic wrap, and they will make cognitive commitments about their environment. Two days later, when you take off the plastic wrap, ninety-nine percent of the flies will stay in the jar because they've made cognitive commitments about their abilities and the environment in which they live. This very same thing is what we tend to do. What this teaches us is that we have made estimates about what we can and cannot do based on our life experience. Moreover, we make those estimates based on what we have paid attention to. At first, those flies paid attention to the plastic wrap. They made judgments about their abilities when the plastic wrap was in place and continued to act from those judgments even when the plastic wrap was no longer there. The flies created a \"map of their reality”. Even when the real world contradicted their map of reality, the flies continued to behave in the old way. They failed to notice that their world changed because of their premature cognitive commitments. As humans, these premature cognitive commitments form our beliefs and values about the world. They were created accidentally while growing up through life experiences and the input of those around us -- parents, teachers and friends. While these beliefs and values may have been useful at one time -- just as it was once true there was plastic wrap"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"on the jar for the flies -- they may no longer be true today. Yet we continue to act as if they are. We are products of our personal map of the world. NLP states that our talents or limitations exist more on the inner world than the outer world. NLP says that just as we have learned to be a certain way accidentally, we can deliberately learn to control our brain to learn to be different. A lot of people think that we stop the ability to learn at a very young age. To the contrary, think of all the futile things you have learned, let alone all the worthwhile things, within the last year... Humans have an amazing ability to learn. Science now claims that when we engage our whole being in the task of learning, (meaning when we acquire behavioral skills and abilities, instead of just acquiring information, facts and statistics), we grow new neural pathways. That means we can promote our mental health and sharpness into old age by continuing to engage in activities that promote learning. We are learning machines and we can learn to feel happy all of the time just as we have learned to have problems. An excellent example is the person with a phobia. When a person has a phobia it is reliable -they don't have it one day and not the next. For example, a person with an elevator phobia will feel fearful even with the thought of going in an elevator. He doesn't forget it and find himself on the fifth floor before realizing he is phobic. He simply avoids elevators and will construct his life around staying out of them. Now contrary to popular belief, this person is not broken and in need of a fix. He works perfectly. His phobia is reliable. People will repeat their limiting behavior over and over again perfectly even though they wish they didn’t. It is automatic. This is why the procrastinator never considers postponing their procrastination. NLP maintains that our limitations are skills. Rather than fix the person, imagine if you could learn to have wonderful feelings and new behaviors as thoroughly and reliably as the phobic or the procrastinator. Imagine if wonderful feelings could operate as automatically as the phobic responds. If you begin to think about any problem as a learned skill rather than something to be fixed a whole new world of possibilities opens up. For example, what if you used procrastination to put off feeling bad when you didn’t get that job or pay raise you wanted. What if you delayed eating that donut? What if you just never got around to it? These examples serve to illustrate how procrastination is a potent mechanism when applied differently, it becomes a useful skill. The key is in learning to break up the automated pattern and re-direct the brain in new ways. We create our experience by the specific ways we delete, distort and generalize information which we take in though our five senses. Our experience is determined by what we pay attention to - by what we see, hear and feel. What we see, hear, feel, taste and smell is represented internally through mental pictures (visualization), internal voices"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"and sounds (self talk) and feelings. We literally create our own reality or map of the world. This is how it is possible for one person to feel terrorized by a simple thing like meeting new people while another person will be excited and energized by it. Think of it this way - we input information into a computer so that it will perform tasks and bring us the results we want. The computer is preexisting. The hardware is already there. We use software so that we can accomplish those tasks. The results are only as good as the quality of the software or hardware. So we need to be sure we have good software, good programs that run reliably. Then we sit at the computer and key in the data, it goes to the central processing unit were it is converted into computer language 1 and 0. We tell the computer in our language what we want it to do and it translates it into an operating language to carry out the functions. You are probably familiar with the concept of GIGO -garbage in / garbage out. If we key in garbage or faulty data we will get poor results. On the other hand if we key in the correct data we get correct results. So it is up to us to be sure we provide it with the correct data. In the same way, our neurology is the hardware we entered the world with. Our learning experiences in growing up constitute the software. The difference between the \"software\" of our brain and that of the computer is that we came by ours accidentally. We didn’t have a programmer or an owner's manual (unfortunately, our brains didn’t come with one) so the programs we run are mostly a matter of luck or chance. But guess what? Everything we learned to do served some useful purpose at some time. It enabled us to continue to grow and live and to succeed! The only difficulty is that the software is an early version and there have been major advances in the world. Most of our software hasn't been brought up to date! If you have ever tried to run old software on a computer you know how difficult that can be. In the same way, our early learning experiences provided for us a foundation in life but they are now outdated and need to be brought up to date. Who's In The Driver's Seat? We take in information though our five senses and then translate that into internal images, sounds and feelings. Just as the flies acted from their map of the world, we act from the one we create inside our head. We look at what we think we can or can’t do, we tell ourselves both good and bad things and we have feelings about how things are. Our feelings are actually composed of the pictures and sounds we make. Think about it this way -- if you make a really horrible picture or tell yourself really horrible things, how do you feel? And do you feel differently when you look at or tell yourself truly wonderful things? Most people have never been able to get hold of their feelings because they have never gotten hold of the things that create them in the first place. I will say that again because it is important! Most people have never been able to get hold of their feelings because they have never gotten hold of the things that create them in the first place. Most therapy doesn't work because they focus on the feelings rather than what creates them. Your brain acts like a massive storage system. It continues to collect data and sort it"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"however it was pre-programmed to do. If you don't program it to generate the kinds of things that you want, it will continue to run on automatic. For example, how often are you not able to sleep at night because you keep re-living an especially joyful experience? Seldom I bet. Instead, your brain decides to show you vivid re-runs of the bad day you’ve had. Or you think about bad things that happened a long time ago. Or you go over and over conversations you had with people. People often let their imagination run wild when they are planning. What happens is that when the event actually takes place, they get disappointed! Richard Bandler, one of the developers of NLP, says, \"Disappointment requires adequate planning\". Did you ever think about how much trouble you have to go though to be disappointed? How about planning to feel absolutely wonderful and delighted when something doesn't go according to your plans? “People have become prisoners of their own brains, as if they are chained to the last seat of a bus and someone else is driving it. Wouldn't it be helpful to learn how to drive your own bus?\" says Bandler. It's time to put yourself in the drivers seat and know the direction you are traveling. NLP is a scientific and reliable method for getting control of the computer between your ears and thereby your life. Learning NLP means you can learn to change your own experience and get some control over what happens in your brain otherwise it will run randomly on its own ... or other people will run it for you and they may not have your best interests at heart. NLP - Software For The Human Mind NLP is often referred to as the software for the human brain because it focuses on process. An NLP practitioner does not ask why do you have a problem (that is the domain of those academicians). Rather, an NLP practitioner will ask and seek to find out how do you have that problem. Knowing how we are having a feeling, how we accomplish a difficult situation with ease, how we operate within the world will give us useful information with which we can make the changes we want and have more of the enjoyable things that we desire. In the same way NLP practitioners do not need to know why it is a chocolate cake, instead they want to know what ingredients to put in and the step by step order to make it come out right. A skilled practitioner knows that there are many ways to make a cake and has many handy tools to assist them in making it. They also want to know how to take a chocolate cake and work backwards to the ingredients in case someone has a secret recipe. When it comes to creating our reality, it is the sequence or order that we pay attention to things through our senses -- the pictures, sounds and feelings and how those are constructed. Think of your television or radio. You have different buttons which control different functions. You have brightness, color, black and white, loudness, stereo or mono, buttons which you use to control what something looks like or sounds like. You can control your brain in the same fashion."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"People operate from their personal map of the world. This map is an internal construct made up of pictures, sounds and feelings. We formed this map during our lives accidentally and we have made premature cognitive commitments which shape our present day reality. These cognitive commitments form the basis for the programs we run. NLP is the software for the human mind. Using NLP concepts and principles you can begin to bring your brain under your control and have more of the kinds of feelings and thoughts that you enjoy. You can learn to train your brain to get it to give you more and more of what you truly want and deserve. If we don't program our brains, they will run on and on, they do what they were accidentally preprogrammed to do. If we don't gain control of our own brain, we are subject to those around us who know how to influence us. Therefore it is crucial to learn to program your brain."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The Framework of Neuro Linguistic Programming 1. NLP is not a model of repair ... it is a model of acquisition ... a generative model. 2. The techniques of NLP are not NLP. The techniques are a product of the modeling process. NLP is a method of modeling. 3. Modeling is a process of acquiring skill. All skills are systematic, patterned and rule structured - therefore, they can be modeled and duplicated. However, modeling does not result in achieving the whole life experience of another person. 4. People are not broken, they work perfectly. They do not need to be fixed. 5. People have all the resources necessary to make any change. 6. People make the best choices given their resources available to them. 7. All external behavior is the result of internal processes. All behavior is communication ... we cannot not respond. 8. The map is not the territory. Our perception of reality is not reality itself. We do not operate directly on our world, but rather through our perceptual map of the world. NLP is a model of the mapping processes. 9. The positive self worth of the individual is held constant. A distinction is made between Self, intention and the behavior an individual engages in. 10. Behavioral Flexibility: The person with the most behavioral flexibility in a given interaction will control the outcome. 11. The meaning of a communication is the response you receive, regardless of your intention. Resistance is the result of inflexibility on the part of the communicator. It is the responsibility of the messenger to get the message across, NOT the listener's responsibility to get the message. 12. Failure equals feedback. There are no mistakes, only results. Without failure and mistakes, learning would be impossible. 13. The highest quality of information in an interaction is behavioral information. 14. The mind and body are pad of-the same cybernetic system. 15. Individuals communicate at two levels - conscious and unconscious. 16. Behavioral flexibility results in more choices. More choices is better than limited choices. 17. Every behavior has a positive intention (for the person doing the behavior)."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Techniques vs. Learning the NLP Methodology NLP is famous for it's trail of rapid change techniques, like the phobia cure.

There is no other brain in the world like yours. Like computers, your brain has an operating system, or a systematic, patterned way that it processes sensory input - but, instead of having similar software programs, we each make up our own through our life experience. We take in information through our senses, and process this information in a way that is unique to each individual on the planet. In doing so, we create software programs that run on automatic until we learn a new program. Since your brain has it's own unique operating language, it has to figure out how to get along with all the other brains on the planet. So it runs all the programs it knows how, to be able to communicate. The brain with the most flexibility, or requisite variety, control the outcomes of communication with the other brains. Brains rely on our senses to bring them information. We see, hear, touch, taste, and smell things in the world. Once we do this, these sensory experiences are turned into either a picture, a sound or a feeling on the inside of our minds. These pictures, sounds and feelings are then run through a series of filters. These filters are our memories, attitudes and values. These filters then pass the pictures, sounds and feelings onto an even more powerful group: distortion, deletion and generalization. Distortion is the seat of your creativity. It is the place where you can create or \"distort\" what you see, hear and feel and make it even better or make it worse. Distortion is what makes it possible to imagine and create things. Distortions is also what allows two people to have completely different interpretations of the same event. Deletion cuts out the information you don't need according to your filters. It decides what is most important for you to keep and what needs to be left out. Deletion allows us to be able to go through the world without sensory overload. Generalization is the organizer. This is where you compare the experience to what you’ve experienced before and pull everything together in one big theme or idea. Generalization allows us to make sense of experience and understand things. It also allows us to make sweeping assumptions that may not be based on fact. Here's an example: An advertisement says, \"This is the finest restaurant in the city. The food is delicious.\" The brain takes that information and goes through the following rotation in less than a second."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Memories: \"Oh, I have heard that before and then the restaurant turned out to be mediocre at best.\" Attitudes: \"New experiences are good. It's fun to do new things.\" Values: \"You know, enjoying delicious food is important to leading a happy life. It is also important to try out new experiences. It makes life exciting. It is good to have excitement.\" Distortion: \"if I eat too much good food, I'll get fat, and if I get fat, I won't be able to make friends, and if I can’t make friends, I'll live a miserable life and die lonely and alone.\" Deletion: “Finest restaurant in the city, sure, but what about the price? I’m sure it will cost us an arm and a leg. Why doesn't the ad say anything about the prices?\" Generalization: \"You know, I just don't trust any of these advertisements. They're all alike. They lie just to get you to buy something.\" What finally comes out is: \"Let's go and have fun. If it turns out to be bad food and the advertisement lied, well, at least we have had a little fun.

Successful people know that you must control not only what you focus on but how you focus . They have learned to take control of their emotions and run their own brain -- that means taking control of what you are picturing in your mind and how you are picturing it, what you are saying to your self and how you are saying it. When you get control over these things, this will allow you to determine how you feel. When you focus, you limit your attention. If you are not focused on success you will miss all the opportunities success brings. In life, we get what we focus on. Remember this: What you focus on, you get. People who do affirmations are wasting their time because they are actually setting up internal conflicts that cause them to activate the opposite of what they want! When people look into the mirror and say, “in every day and in every way, I am getting better and better,” a part of their mind comes back and says, \"bull!\" Doesn't it? It is just like if I told you that you have a blue shirt on when you actually have a red one on! I say, \"nice blue shirt\" and you say, \"it's not blue, it's red.\" Then I say, \"it's blue\", and you say \"no, it's red\" ... we could go on like this forever... which is exactly what happens for most people when they do affirmations. Instead of engaging yourself in this confrontive struggle with yourself, you could begin to ask yourself questions instead. Questions will always get you an answer. Questions change what you focus on. They get you to focus on either what is good about you, your environment or your behavior or what is bad about you, your environment, or your behavior. An affirmation in the form of a question is 300 or 400 times more effective and will literally train your brain to translate the affirmations into your behavior. Why Questions are More Powerful than Affirmations Brains learn quickly to move in directions. Questions direct the mind. They divide experience and lead our attention. Questions demand an answer. And since it is a question which our brain may not know the answer to yet, it will search to give us an answer. If, when we ask the question, we include more of what we want in our life, our brain will search to provide us with those things which we included in our question and the answer. Asking yourself questions is one of the greatest things you can learn for yourself. Questions set your reality. Think about it. If I say, “what did you do on Friday?\" Where does your mind go? It goes to look for an answer. If I say “how old are you?\" You know the answer. If I say, \"what did you do last summer?”, \"What is your occupation?\", \"Who was your best friend when you were a child?\"... You are causing your mind to come up"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"with an answer. Sometimes you won't have the answer right away. Sometimes you may have to ask another question like, \"gee, who was it?\" You are sending your mind in a direction. According to anthropologists, people are \"meaning makers.” In other words, people will ask themselves \"what does this mean to me?\", \"what is in it for me?\", or \"what should I do?\" It is the questions we ask ourselves that create meaning for ourselves. And you have a choice as to what exactly those questions are going to be. Are you going to ask yourself questions that get you bad results, like \"how come I’m so stupid?\" or are you going to ask yourself questions that get you good results like \"how soon will I begin to realize how wonderful I am?\" The kinds of things you ask yourself are critical. If you say \"gee, how come I am so stupid?\", your brain goes \"because when you were a child you didn’t eat Wheaties, you didn’t have corn flakes, you didn’t grow up right and it was your parents fault.\" Or because \"you are a slow learner\" -- because someone told you that when you were a child. Or because \"you aren't disciplined enough\", or \"you have great potential but you'll never really amount to anything\"... Whatever it might be, when you say \"how come I’m like this?\", your brain will answer and it will come up with a reason no matter how logical or illogical it is. The number one thing in our culture, bar none is that when someone in our culture says \"why\" someone says “because\". When you say to yourself, \"I don't understand this\" or \"I don't get it\" you are reinforcing anything that you do not understand yet. You are making it much tougher on yourself. You are impeding your learning. On the other hand, if you say, \"I wonder how soon before this begins to make sense? I wonder how quickly before I am going to be delighted in discovering what is new about this? I wonder how soon before I delight and amaze myself?\" you begin to send your brain in the direction that is useful for you. As you ask yourself those questions, your brain may not come up with the quick \"because\" answer because you are posing a question to yourself that you don't yet know the answer to. Wouldn't it be a lot more fun finding out? Wouldn't it be a lot more interesting to think \"gee, I wonder how exquisitely talented I can become? I wonder how I can use language to do things that I never yet before considered possible? I wonder who I am going to find that presents a challenge and I wonder how I am going to delight and amaze myself in overcoming that challenge and doing that in ways that I never before thought possible?\" Does that sound like a more useful way to begin looking at the world? ... a more useful way, a way that brings you more delight, more pleasure and speeds up the amount of time in which you learn anything?

To be truly successful, fulfilled and secure, you must make a habit of asking the kinds of questions that give you power, drive and energy.

By doing this, you will be able to succeed in your goals beyond your wildest expectations. You are already asking yourself questions every moment of the day. If you say “yes, Rex, That's true\" or \"no Rex that is not true” ... the only way you could answer that is by having asked yourself a question! For at least the next 21 days, I want you to ask yourself a different set of questions first thing every morning, before going to bed and any moment you can throughout the day, You will want to write them down, carry them with you, pin them up where you will see them and be reminded to ask. Remember what you do now determines the quality of your future. The quality of your life depends on the quality of the questions you ask. Some Sample Questions How come I am so lucky? Why am I so wonderful? What new wonderful things will I discover? How can I become thinner and enjoy the process? I wonder in how many ways I can become better and better? I wonder how quickly I can achieve my ideal weight? Which sensation in my body feels the very best right now? How quickly will I begin to team these new skills? How naturally and easily will I begin to pay attention to pleasant feelings? How soon will I begin to notice with delight how happy I can become? Using Questions With Others To Be More Persuasive In the same way that you ask yourself questions that direct your mind, you can use questions to direct the mind of your customers an clients. The mind is easily programmed and lead to make decisions within the options that are given. Would you like to order your dessert now or when you have your coffee? Is this cash or charge? When customers are asked “would you like a large or small coke?\" most take a small. However when asked, \"would you like a large one?\" most take a large."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Do you realize how excited it is going to be when you take this vacation? How quickly can we finish our meeting? In how many different ways are you going to enjoy this house?"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Why Traditional Visualization Doesn't Work And How You Can Modify It To Get The Results You Want Now that you can ask yourself new questions, you also want to get your visualizations in order. I am sure you have heard of visualization. This is where people tell you to visualize your goals, dreams, plans, or how you want things to be. Usually people make still-frame pictures in their head of the goal being accomplished, e.g. depositing money in the bank, or their kids all grown up and successful. What makes Mind Design different from visualization is that we have created three steps in creating visualizations. Without these three steps, visualizations just don't work well at all and you'll just be wasting your time. Three Important Steps For Effective Visualizations 1. Visualize the accomplished goal or outcome. Example: Salesperson depositing large commission check in the bank. 2. Make a movie of how you achieved the goal. What steps did you take to achieve your success? Visualize the steps in detail. Visualize yourself doing all the right things to get your outcome, and visualize everything going perfectly. Example: Salesperson making more calls and customers responding by being pleasant and purchasing items. 3. Build a contingency plan. Visualize yourself taking all the steps toward your goal and visualize everything going wrong and how you overcame the difficulty. Example: Salesperson making more calls and customers do not respond. Visualize what the salesperson did to get customer to respond more favorably. Besides only making pictures of the goal being attained (Step 1), you make a movie of how you get the goal (Step 2). For example a salesperson wants to make more sales and money. Instead of just visualizing depositing more money in the bank, a Mind Design TM salesperson visualizes the actual steps they took to make more sales. (2) The salesperson visualizes them doing all the right things and people responding in all the right ways to increase their sales and their money. But the Mind Design TM salesperson also does something which is the most crucial; THE THIRD STEP... This person visualizes a movie of all the possible obstacles and how they got over all of them. Ordinarily, this third step is what people do to program their mind for failure because they imagine everything going wrong, but not what they did to overcome it. Using this method, you program your mind for how to overcome adversity along the way if you encounter it. When you learn how to run your brain then a world of endless possibility and opportunity becomes available. Unfortunately, for most people, it is left to chance and that is why success is usually a matter of luck. I want to teach you the science and the art of making your dreams come true. The science because it is actually steps that you can implement, recipes, formulas proven through time to work for you and the art because your creativity with the science will enable you to realize your dreams and design for yourself the kind of life you truly want and deserve."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Your brain can give you everything you want when you give it a clear bright focused image of what you want and how you are planning to go about getting it. If you don't know what you want your brain can’t give it to you. But when you know what you want, and you send precise, direct and intense signals, your mind has the power to give you what you want. You can’t reach your goals if you don't know what they are. Results are inevitable.

If you don't have a program for your life someone else is going to make you fit into their plan."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Expert Communicator Becoming an Expert Communicator requires an understanding of the process of communication. Communicating is more than the content. It is more than talking and listening; more than the words we speak. Communicating is the combination of three important elements which make up the communication process. These elements are: 1. the words we speak 2. how we speak them - our voice tone, tempo and volume 3. our non-verbal body language, gestures and facial expressions. Dr. Albert Mehrabian, an expert in nonverbal communication calculated the relative weights of these three elements as: 1. Words 7% 2. Vocal Qualities 38% 3. Body Language as 55%. This means that up to 93% of the communication process is not the words we use! Therefore, it takes more than just words to express ourselves, gain Rapport and change attitudes. The Mind Reader A major problem in communication is when someone \"mind reads\" the intent or internal state (feelings or thoughts) of another individual. This is one of the most dangerous forms of disrespect because the person doing the mind reading rarely understands what they are engaged in doing. The mind reader usually believes his perceptions to be accurate. Mind reading is claiming to know the feelings, thoughts, or intentions of other people based on their use of words, behavior and/or nonverbal expressions. See chart. It can be as simple as noticing someone walking unusually fast and making the comment: “Jackie seems really upset today.\" In NLP, we attempt to become more precise and accurate in our communication by realizing that claiming to know what is going on inside another individual is not the way to produce better results in communicating with that person."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Self Other IS - Internal State IP - Internal Process EB - External Behavior Instead, we choose to begin by defining the communication in Sensory Specific terms: to describe another's communication process by what is observable to others and without attaching meaning to our description. For example, often when we see someone with their lips curled upward and their teeth exposed, crinkle lines around the eyes and nose, and a more flushed skin tone; a communication novice would describe that as smiling. A mind reader would assume that smiling means that the person is happy, mischievous, embarrassed, sly or whatever. The Expert Communicator knows that the only way to know for certain, without making psychic assumptions, is to ask the individual what their behavior meant to them. Sensory Specific terms allows the Expert Communicator to note only what he is able to observe and hear. If a jury of twelve people were in the same room and they all saw the same nonverbal behavior as described above, they would probably assign 12 different meanings to express what they thought was occurring inside this individual. Because of this, as practitioners of NLP, we describe another's behavior only in terms of what the jury could all agree on. All twelve would agree that the person’s lips curled up, more teeth were exposed, that there are increased crinkle lines around the eyes and nose and that the skin color became more flushed, or more simply, that there was a shift in the person’s facial expression. This way, we are able to calibrate changes in these physiological indicators to determine when a change in the person’s behavior occurs. If, for example, the individual's skin color goes pale, his lips become fuller, the lines around the eyes and nose smooth out, his facial muscles become drawn out, and his head pulls down, we are able to notice the degree of change without assigning a meaning to the person’s behavior. Expert Communicators do not mind-read what the change means, they only note that the changes have occurred. It is important to begin to increase our observational skills by making only Sensory Specific observations. This will enable one to begin to pay more attention to the process of communication: the 93%. Sensory Specific information also goes a long way in establishing Rapport because the Expert Communicator does not assume to know what another person is thinking and feeling. This way, we are being respectful to the other person. We are respecting the other person’s map and the ability of the individual to be unique. What is Mind Reading? Mind Reading is claiming to know what a person’s internal state (feelings or intentions) is without bothering to ask the person. Mind Reading is a dangerous form of communication because it is extremely disrespectful of others. People generally do not appreciate being judged. IPIP IS IP EB IS IP EB IS = Internal State IP = Internal Process EB = External Behavior Mind Reading is observing external behavior and assigning a meaning or a j udgement about the person’s internal state or process. For example, \"Smilin g at me means she likes me.\""},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Since Mind Reading for the most part has become a habit and socially approved way of communicating in our culture, most people are not aware that they do it. Some people even Mind Read others inside their head without even verbalizing it. In this case, it usually comes out in their behavior. Mind Reading becomes the trigger for arguments between couples and friends, the basis for misinterpretation in the communication process, and various other problems that can be avoided. In Mind Design TM training, we continually stress the importance of learning how NOT to Mind Read because it can be such a destructive pattern. However, like any pattern, there is usefulness and non-usefulness. For example, Mind Reading can be a very effective way to pace a person into a trance. We will cover this later. For now, continue to catch yourself and stop when you find yourself engaged in Mind Reading! Some examples of destructive but common Mind Reading patterns I know.... I know that you are mad at me. I know what that look means. I know that when you do that, you don't care about me. When he talks to me in that tone of voice, I know it means trouble. Susan is really cranky today. Don't bother him today, he's in a bad mood. What's wrong with you? I think that they are not getting along very well, because... Is something bothering you? Oh-oh, it's that time of the month again. I know that he intentionally did it to hurt me. She is very nervous sifting in front of everyone. He has a hard time relaxing. She obviously was not enjoying herself. Characteristics of the Expert Communicator 1. The ability to identify and achieve desired outcomes in communicating with others. This requires setting Well Formed Outcomes for the communication process. 2. The ability to see and hear accurately by using clean sensory apparatus to notice verbal and nonverbal communication elements. 3. The ability to utilize one's own verbal and nonverbal behavior to develop Rapport and deliver precise messages. 4. The ability to demonstrate flexibility in one's own behavior. Often Number 4 is the hardest to achieve because most of us feel we already are fairly good communicators. It is particularly difficult to be flexible if we mind-read, claim that our beliefs, actions and attitudes are \"right\", or decide that the other person isn't willing to communicate with us. Therefore, it is extremely useful to have an integrated understanding of the Presuppositions of NLP and to frame our endeavors in light of these principles."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Responsible Communication There are no mistakes in communication, only feedback. The idea is to learn to become flexible so that you can communicate to a wider variety of people. To be flexible means to use your body as an instrument to create harmony with others. The Platinum Rule: Do onto others as they prefer to be done onto. Instead of the golden rule: Do onto others as you would prefer to be done onto. Expert Communicators seem to have the ability to adjust their communication so that it's appropriate for whom they are communicating with -- being able to adopt the logic, body posture, and facial expressions of the other person. Flexibility in your behavior is what allows you to elicit a wide range of responses from the people with whom you are communicating. All communication produces a response. The question is: are you getting the response that you want? If not, that means that your clients and friends are also stuck in their ways. But on the other hand, if you notice that what you are doing is not working and immediately change your behavior in some way -- your voice tone, what you talk about, your syntax, your body movements -- your clients and friends will respond accordingly. Learn to match communication to establish Rapport; and also learn to mismatch, because if you don't have a choice, you are a robot. Expert Communicators notice what result they're getting and will alter their behavior to get the best result. Other people will judge themselves and others. Experience is not good or bad, not right or wrong. It just is. The Law of Requisite Variety Every voice tone, every syntax, everything you say is a set of choices. And the first thing that will give you effectiveness is to understand the Law of Requisite Variety which says the following: If you have more flexibility - a wide range of variability in your behavior - you will be able to elicit a wide range of variability in your clients and in all the people in the world around you. Responsible communication is where you notice what response you are getting and adjust your own behavior accordingly."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Pattern Interrupts Or Break State A Pattern Interrupt or a Break State is anything that disturbs the flow of conversation or activity. Pattern Interrupts occur all the time. In the middle of a conversation someone enters your office, the phone rings or your child screams and it interrupts where you were, often creating amnesia. While these can be annoying or stressful in daily life, if you use them deliberately in your practice of NLP, they can be valuable and useful. Have you ever said anything you regretted and wished you could take back? A pattern interrupt can help you recover the foot that was in your mouth! Pattern Interrupts are most effective if you use them just as the trouble or problem begins. Something in the other person’s body language, voice tone, or facial expression flashes by, signaling trouble on the horizon. At that point, a pattern interrupt can be used to stop the trouble before it starts. By breaking the flow in the behavior or conversation, you may rescue it before it turns sour. Pattern Interrupts include - coughing, sneezing, dropping something, swatting a bug, exclaiming, loud noise, - what else can you think of. A Break State, or accessing a neutral state can be used to help the person you are working with distinguish between two states. After eliciting a particular state for an exercise or session, use a break state before eliciting the second state. This functions to separate the states so that you do not inadvertently \"chain\" the states together. \"Chaining\" means anchoring the second state to come up every time the person goes into the first state. Break States can include - asking person to look at something (floor, chair, sky, lamp, etc.), asking person to \"shake it off\", asking person, \"what did you have for breakfast\", ask person to \"reorient to the present time or to the room\", asking person to stand up or sit down, etc."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CALIBRATION Calibration is a means to measure and utilize the obvious outer behavioral changes of an individual as their internal thinking and feeling state changes. What is happening on the inside is reflected in the behavior on the outside. You can calibrate like/dislike, agreement/disagreement, or yes/no. You can use this information for a variety of uses. The three major areas to pay attention to while calibrating are Body position - upper body, posture, arms and legs, head tilt, gestures, distance Breathing Rate - fast/ slow/even Breathing Position - high/ low/ middle Facial Expressions - skin color, muscle tone, eye movements, mouth, lips Exercise - Calibrate a Friend Observe a friend or loved ones “body language” when you know that they are in one particular state (happy, sad, frustrated) and remember what you see (take a mental snap shot or video). Later, when you see the same \"snap shot\", most likely you are seeing the same internal state. Do NOT attach a meaning to the \"body language\" (Mind Reading) you are simply observing behavior. Exercise - Calibrate Yes and No The purpose of this exercise is to help the Practitioner discover the nonverbal signals which accompany “yes” and “no” responses. 1. Practitioner asks subject 10 questions that will get a \"yes\" response. Examples: Do you live in the United States? Are you a man (woman)? Practitioner identifies sensory cues for \"yes\" response. Examples: Eye blink, head tilt, skin color change, eye movement, muscle tone. 2. Practitioner asks subject 10 questions that will get a \"no\" response. Examples: Do you have four legs? Do you have green hair? Practitioner identifies sensory cues for \"no\". 3. Once the Practitioner identifies those sensory distinctions for both “yes\" and \"no, Practitioner asks questions for which they don't know the true answer and Practitioner pays attention to the sensory distinctions for the response.

Subject chooses three different intense memories. (Not traumatic ones!) Subject goes back into each one (one at a time). Use \"code\" numbers, colors or letters to identify each state. When the subject gets the memory intensely the subject nods head to let Practitioner and observers know subject is in the experience vividly. Break state between each experience. 2. Practitioner and Observers build a sensory based description for each state. Subject then goes through each memory experience again and Practitioner describes without any judgments but in sensory based language what is observable with each state. When completed Subject picks out one of the states without telling the others what it is and Practitioner and Observer attempt to identify which \"code\" number, color or letter it is from the calibrations they made before. Repeat until there are three successes in a row and then rotate. Exercise - Increasing Visual Acuity Purpose is to increase visual acuity and descriptive ability. Subject stands in any position. Practitioner closes eyes. Subject tells Practitioner to open eyes and take a mental snapshot of what they see. Wait about ten seconds and tell them to close their eyes. Subject shifts some part of their body, adopts a different stance, or moves in some fashion and then tells Practitioner to open eyes and describe \"what is different?\" Subject may physically demonstrate what is different too. Start by making large movements and then move down to very small shifts. Use entire body and facial expression. As Practitioner gets better, decrease the amount of time they have their eyes open while taking a mental snap shot. Observer watches exercise to keep Subject honest. Exercise - Increasing Kinesthetic Acuity Purpose: sensory calibration of kinesthetic distinctions, and to be able to match touch by watching and applying pressure. Subject has back to Practitioner and Observer. Practitioner touches Subject on back and says their name. Observer touches Subject in exactly the same spot and says their name. Do this three or four times to calibrate who is touching. Then either Practitioner or Observer touches subject (random order) in the same place without identifying themselves. Subject's task is to identify who is touching. When the subject is unable to determine who is touching because Practitioner and Observer have been able to match their touches, then switch roles. Make the exercise harder as you go along - reduce the differences (match) more and more. You can use different touches on the back or shoulder (arm or knee, if seated), later use the knees or forearms. Remember: If the person can’t tell who is doing what, go back and re-calibrate when necessary. Exercise - Increasing Auditory Acuity Purpose is to increase ability to make auditory distinctions and match closely. 1. Subject sits in chair with eyes closed while Practitioner and Observer stand in front of subject. 2. Practitioner makes a sound (snaps fingers, claps hands) in front of Subject and says their name after making the sound. 3. Observer attempts to duplicate the sound (in the exact location) and identifies self."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 4. Calibrate a few times.

The purpose to have practice in noticing auditory distinctions and to experiment with different auditory modalities (volume, tone, pitch etc.)"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Pacing Statement The easiest and most reliable way to calibrate is to use a Pacing Statement. A Pacing Statement is an undeniably true statement of observation which you know to be true. For example, upon observing Canon Copiers in a client's office, a salesperson says, \"So you use Canon copiers in your office?\". This way you can calibrate the \"yes\" signals. To calibrate \"no” signals, you can then ask them a question you know to be untrue, or one they would disagree with and observe their behavior. For example, knowing your prospect's name is Mary, you say, “Your name is Margaret, right?\". A great way to break the ice in any encounter is to make at least one pacing statement. They usually work best if you comment on something that directly impacts the individual. Pacing Statements are ice breakers and help to assist in the development of rapport - and they are easy ways to begin calibration. A pacing statement rather than a question does not require the other person to respond verbally, although they usually will. If you do use a question, use an open ended question which can’t be answered with a quick yes or no. Pacing Statements are great to use with everyone - especially in sales where you need to get past certain people to get to the decision makers. This approach works because you are not asking anyone to do anything - you are simply making a positive and often complimentary statement to the person. You are implicitly telling the other person \"I am interested in you\". Whether verbal or nonverbal - the customer sets the pace - you follow. Don't move to your agenda until the customer is ready. Practice pacing statements everywhere in your life - restaurants, malls, service stations etc. You'll get better results and people will remember you for your interest and rapport. Sample Pacing Statements During a sales call: So we are sifting here and we are discussing your purchasing a new car... There are certain things about owning a new car that are important to you.... We've had the opportunity to take a look at your needs ..... And we've discussed all the features that you want ... So, you’ve had the opportunity to test drive the car .... To initiate a trance: We are sifting here together... You are listening to the sound of my voice... As you breath in and out... You can feel the weight of your body on the chair...

Now that you have finished your meal...."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Calibration and Sensory Specific Information The most accurate kind of information is Sensory Specific because it is behavioral information. Remember: The highest quality of information is behavioral. Since people have different maps of the world it is important to be able to describe what is going on as accurately as possible. One way to do this, we will discover later in the practitioner training, is to enter the other person’s map of reality and to speak from it. Another way is by clarifying information in terms of what can be seen, heard, and felt. Most people are in the habit of describing what we see, hear or feel in interpretive terms and give meaning to other's behavior that may or may not be accurate. For example, you see a certain look on a person’s face and you describe that person as unfriendly, mean, angry, or upset. This is what we call Mind Reading because it is a non-sensory based assumption. When you ask that person what is going on, you may be surprised to discover that the person is actually is in physical pain. You are surprised because this is something you hadn't even considered. To “clean up” our communication as practitioners of NLP we use sensory based descriptions to describe what we see, hear or feel.

These are the five primary sensory modalities by which people encode, organize, store and attach meaning to perceptual input. In the field of Neuro Linguistic Programming, we call these modalities Representational Systems or Rep Systems. As input from the five senses is processed in the brain, it is translated into corresponding internal representations, or maps, that constitute a likeness to the outside world. This means that on the inside we see pictures, hear sounds and have feelings. We can also remember tastes and smells. What is most important to keep in mind is that our perceptions and \"reality\" differ greatly because of our filters, deletion, distortion and generalization. This means that the map (internal sensory re-representations) and the real world are not the same while most people act as if it is. Remember: The Map is not the territory This is not new. Scientist and psychologist have known this for years. What distinguishes NLP is that the developers discovered that within each modality or Rep system are smaller components which are called Submodalities. For example, within the visual modality are Submodalities such as the size of the image, location, brightness and color. For the auditory system, there is location of the sound, loudness, distance from the individual. The kinesthetic (or feeling) rep system Submodalities include temperature, location, pressure, duration. Why is this discovery so critical? Because it is at the Submodality level that experience is coded, and therefore it is at this level that experience can be changed. The developers found that by changing the Submodalities without even knowing the content, people could have instant relief from bad feelings. For example, try criticizing yourself in a sensual, inviting tone of voice, or a Mickey Mouse tone. It's pretty difficult to feel bad when you have Mickey Mouse talking to you. Every moment throughout the day, we have a tremendous amount of information bombarding our Rep Systems. This input is filtered by the central nervous system allowing only a limited amount of information to reach our conscious attention. As an example, when you pour chalky fluid through a filter, not all of the contents within the fluid are allowed to pass through. In this same way, our filtering mechanism screens sensory input through a set of operations called deletion, distortion and generalization. Without these neurological filters, we would be overwhelmed by the constant deluge of information. While these filters serve to protect us, they also explain how is it possible for one person to be excited about public speaking when another person is terrified by it. It all lies in what they do inside their brain and what kinds of directions they have given it. The wonderful part is that we are limited or enhanced simply by what we happen to be paying attention to or NOT paying attention to at any given moment. In NLP, we utilize this naturally occurring process to RE-DIRECT the person’s brain so that they are paying attention to different things. Each person’s internal map of reality will be different. A persons map is an accurate reflection of that person’s internal processing, yet it is an inaccurate and incomplete representation of the world. Altering the map changes the person’s experience in the real world. Personal Map Of The World All of us have our own unique perception of the world around us which constitute our map of the world or \"Map\". That means our friends, customers, parents, children and loved ones don't see the world through the same set of filters as we do.

Over time, cities grow and change so the map needs to be adjusted and updated. Just like our Personal Map needs to be adjusted and updated when we grow and change. Our perceptual filters will determine what we remember. (Delete, Distort, Generalize) Our memories and beliefs are our personal maps of an outer reality.

They turn your words into pictures and images. Their minds work like view-masters or movie cameras and are happiest when you paint pictures for them. They understand your words by comparing past and future images while you talk. Visuals talk about seeing, how things appear, from a point of view: \"I wonder how my wife will look when she sees the beautiful flowers I bought for her.\" \"I remember the look on his face when I told him I was pregnant. \" They may be better with faces than with names. They tend to care about establishing eye contact. They may make judgments by appearance I can tell you are a sincere person just by how you look.\" They have good memory - good spellers because they picture the word in their mind unlike the auditory speller who sounds out the word. Visuals need to see you to hear you and pay more attention to color (dress and environment), appearance and irregularities in appearance. They may be distracted by a hair that is out of place or a smudge on a persons face. The \"paint\" pictures with words and hands. They tend to be well organized and prefer not to be touched. They make buying decisions by how products look (the cover artwork). Body Types A thin, tense body is characteristic of visual as dominant system. Natural Language Predicates (See predicate chart) Posture Visual - shoulder hunched and neck extended forward. Eye Movements (See chart for generalizations related to the direction of eye accessing movements). Squinting indicates visualization. Blinking generally indicates visualization. Blinking often, even, and rhythmic indicates sequences of images; sometimes indicates \"punctuation” of information, but blinking may also indicate other modality accessing depending on the position of the head. Prolonged eye closure accompanied by rapid eye movements indicates visual processing. Breathing Changes Breathing high in the chest or momentarily holding the breath indicates visual access."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Visualization is also characterized by shallow breathing. Tonality Changes High pitched nasal and or strained tonality indicates visual access. Tempo Changes Quick bursts of words and a generally fast tempo indicate visual access.

Hands shading or covering eyes indicates visual access. Skin Color Changes Paling or waning of color indicates visualization Persuading The Visual Use visual predicates and paint pictures. \"Can you picture your wife's face when you bring home the beautiful bouquet of flowers?

They listen to how you say things. They get more information from how you say things than by what you show them. The paralinguistic cues (how you say what you say) are more important than your content. Their mind works like a juke box or tape recorder. It plays back recordings to get an idea of what you are talking about. They like rhymes and word plays and prefer to communicate by phone or face to face rather than memos or letters. They don't need to see you face to face because they are comfortable on the telephone. They like to romance by phone. Often have deep resonant voices, speaking rhythmically and deliberately concerned about how they sound. e.g. Gary Owens from Laugh-In, Robert Schuller TV Minister, and Jesse Jackson They touch their face with hands, tap fingers or toes, count on their fingers. Live concerts and music are important to them. They are aware of sounds, delivery, pace and tone. They listen to radio rather than watch television and prefer cassette tapes to video tapes. Inflection of your voice can distract them from your content. Auditory people talk about what people say... \"I wonder what my wife will say to me when she finds out I brought her flowers. \"That concept rings a bell.” \"Her voice resonates throughout my entire being. \" “My boss sounded angry when he called me into the office.

Their information comes predominantly from touch, feeling, emotions, gut instincts, hunches and attitude more than what you say. They buy because of how they feel about you and your product. They get an instant feeling of like or dislike when around you. They have a good kinesthetic memory and need to \"feel it\" before they trust you. When they feel good about you, they buy. Kinestetics are often athletic or overweight. They love the feeling of athletic games and competition. They touch themselves along the midline often and \"weigh\" decisions with their hands. They are more breathy than other types and pause more - to access feelings. They will feel hot or cold about you right away - will make instant judgments. They love to touch people and things. Kinestetics may touch you to make a point. When comfortable, they can understand more readily. They are more apt to feel temperature changes than Visuals or Auditories. Kinos shower long, lingering in the sensations, enjoying food, etc. They tend to dress comfortably rather than fashionably, to learn by doing, and enjoy sports. Kinesthetic people talk about feelings: \"I can’t seem to get a handle on this problem and it makes me feel stressed. \"It was just a gut feeling and I went with it \" ”That person just rubs me the wrong way.” Common Kinesthetic Expressions: \"down right mean” \"down right true\" \"down right important” \"touch base\" “get a grip\" “get a handle\" \"rubs me the wrong way\" Body Types A full, soft body is characteristic of a kinesthetic (internal) person.

Words like fun, happiness, trust, honesty indicate a person’s values. Criteria is the rule structure and belief system related to how values are attained. Examples are phrases like, \"You have to work long hours to succeed in business\" or \"You must watch your diet to stay healthy\". Criteria are beliefs around values. Remember to appeal to the person's values and rules when you are persuading them. There is always 1% that you can agree with 100%. \"And\" / \"But\" Use \"and\" when you want to achieve agreement with your listener. The word \"but\" will negate everything you say before it. For example: \"I want to go, but I’m tired\" \"So you're tired and you want to go.\" or \"So you’re tired but you want to go.\" Use of \"not\" Change phrases like \"You’re not making yourself clear.\" to \"I’m having difficulty understanding this.\" In this way, you take responsibility for the communication. Context Reframe Separate the intention from the behavior. Since every behavior is appropriate in some context, think of a different context in which the person’s behavior would be appropriate. \"It is appropriate to use physical force to restrain a suspect or in self-defense, but it is not appropriate to use physical force just because you are angry at the suspect.\" Meaning Reframe \"Whenever X, I respond to Y\".

It means that the Expert Communicator has the ability to respond to the individual's \"map of the world\" from that person’s perspective as much as possible, without mind reading or assigning a value judgment. Rapport is a gateway to connect with others in meaningful ways. This can be accomplished at several levels. People Like People Who Are Like Themselves Pacing is simply the process of matching the other person’s behavioral patterns. By mastering it, you will develop the ability to get Rapport with anyone anywhere and be able to influence people more profoundly. Pacing is a way of acknowledging another person and meeting them in their map of the world. When you are pacing, you are sending the message \"I am like you” and people like people who are like themselves. You can begin to pace someone by identifying a pattern and adjusting your behavior to match the other person. Subtly is the key to pacing. It is extremely important, while matching, to keep it subtle so that what you are doing does not intrude on the other person’s conscious awareness. How You Can Connect With Anyone In Under A Minute. The top sales people are not relying on closing techniques. They lay the groundwork of success before they ask for the sales. Some people are afraid of closing. Rapport through pacing and leading is what gets the successful close. Top achievers have the ability to develop sound relationships and to do it quickly. You are accessed by others within the first minute and if you can’t connect with them quickly, you will lose out. Fortunately, any one can learn to build rapport. The heart of rapport is similarity between you and another. You will be using the same rapport approaches as the top producers in the world. Pacing involves appreciating yourself enough to use your verbal and nonverbal communication as an exquisite instrument, allowing you to maintain your own wholeness, your own comfort, your own sense of balance, while acknowledging another person’s experience. Matching Content We can begin with Matching or Mirroring the other individual's content. This occurs when we discuss topics we have a shared interest in. Often we describe this as having something \"in common\" with the other person. This is, however, the least effective means of gaining Rapport. For years, sales trainers used to tell sales people to comment on"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"objects in the prospect's office, like a trophy or plaque on the wall -- \"Wow, you must be quite a bowler.” This is the fastest way to discredit yourself before the sales process even starts when the client says, \"This isn't my office, now what are you going to present to me?\". Matching Predicates or \"Buzz Words\" The most effective methods are Matching or Mirroring the predicates, the vocal qualities and nonverbal body language, the chunk size (whether the person likes the big picture or the details) and values (what's important to the person). Detect and match in your own language the primary predicates of the other person. Match eye accessing cues. When we speak, we give clues about how we think. Because we choose our words unconsciously, they give an accurate description of how we make sense of the world we live in. We use words that describe how we process the information we take in through our five senses. We talk about what we see, hear, feel, smell and taste in the world as well as what is going on inside our heads. The Expert Communicator learns to listen for these predicates (buzz words) and to match them back to the person he is communicating with. If someone is painting a picture using visual words, when speaking to that person, the Expert Communicator paints them a picture as well. If they are talking about how things sound or feel to them, the Expert Communicator speaks in similar terms. This listener receives the message that the Expert hears and understands them. This is a major step in increasing the degree of Rapport and understanding between people. Example: Child: “Mom, the way I see it, you are not being fair to me. NLPer Mom: \"I can understand how you see it that way. Let's find out if we can see eye to eye on this.\" Matching VAK Language Sequence People may use one or two of the sensory systems. Most tend to use more than one. Follow the sequence they use. If you treat a visual like a kino, the visual simply won't respond. You pay attention and you can do anything else, switch modes to communicate more effectively. Example: Boss: “We need to get a handle on this situation so that we can all work in harmony with each other.\" NLPer Employee: “Let's put our heads together and talk about solutions.”"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Matching Vocal Qualities and Paralinguistic Cues The Expert Communicator listens for the tone, tempo, volume, rate of speech and pauses of the person with whom he is interacting, and as accurately as possible, matches back these elements in subtle ways. For example, if someone speaks slowly, the Expert Communicator slows down the rate of his speech, if the person talks loudly, then the expert adjusts his volume to match that volume. Match tone, tempo, volume, intensity, pitch etc. Note and match in your own language the repeated phrases or stylized grammatical use of the other person, Matching Non-Verbal Body Language The Expert Communicator matches the other person’s body posture, facial expressions, gestures, and breathing rate. Again, as the Expert Communicator adjusts the features of his communication style to match the person with whom he is relating, an unconscious message is sent to the other person. That person receives the message \"this person is like me.\" Communication research has heavily bore out that we tend to like people who are like ourselves. Mirroring is to match back the person’s behavior as a mirror image. So that as the person looks at the Expert Communicator, the person sees is a mirror image of himself. Adjust your body to approximate the other person’s posture. Pace any consistent or stylistic use of the body - eye blinks, head nod etc. Match the upper or lower portion of the other person’s body. Note the way the other person uses their face - raise their eyebrows, wrinkle their nose, etc. Match characteristic poses the other person offers with their head and shoulders. With minute and graceful movements and timing, match the gesture patterns of the other person. Adjust your own breathing to synchronize with the other person’s breath rate and location. Matching Chunk Size If a person likes the \"big picture\", the Expert Communicator presents the \"big picture\". If the person prefers the details, then this is how the Expert Communicator alters his/her communication. You will notice that chunk size preference is generally sequential, or that which the person wants to hear first. Some start off with big picture and move toward filling in the details, while others prefer it reversed. Example: Wife: \"It is important to talk about what is really important about our relationship before we attempt to solve these little problems.\" Husband: \"I think that our friendship is what is most important here, and these little problems come up when we forget about the larger issue.\""},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Matching Values Values are the things in life a person invests their time, money and effort to achieve. These are usually expressed as nominalizations. For example: fun, freedom, honesty, love, friendship, or leisure time are words used to describe what people value. People tend to have their values aligned in a hierarchy which can be determined by asking them specific questions. By aligning with their values, or by discussing things in terms of the individual's hierarchy, the same unconscious message that \"you are like me\" is sent. If the person’s values are very different than yours, you DO NOT have to lie to them. Keep in mind that there is always 1% that you can agree upon 100%. Start there! Example: Client: “It love to go boating on the weekends.” Non-boating Salesperson: \"What is important to you about boating?\" Client: \"When I go boating, it feel so free - I get an incredible sense of freedom when I’m out there in the vast, open waters.” Non-boating Salesperson: \"I can totally understand that, I get that sense of freedom when I go hiking. It just feels so free to be out in nature. Cross Over Matching Using one aspect of your behavior to match a different aspect of the other person’s behavior. Pace eye blinks with your finger or breathing rate with your head nods. Tap your finger rhythmically to their breath or cadence of speech. Sway your body subtly to their rhythm. Most powerful form of match is to match their rhythm. Matching Key Gestures You can match and steal people's key gestures, which are repetitive gestures that occur usually to emphasize a point and are frequently accompanied by a shift in their voice volume. Steal their key gestures so that when you make a point you can use their gestures. You are sending that unconscious message that \"I am like you\" - which means they are more likely to make your point important because it is the same way they act when they make important points. And remember \"people like people who are like themselves\". Matching Key Words And Phrases Steal key words and phrases just as you steal key gestures. Key words and phrases are repetitive and are given special emphasis by a subtle but noticeable shift in volume or rate increase and are often accompanied by a key gesture. Example: Student: “Doesn't my painting look cool when it is hung on the wall?\" Teacher: \"Yes!

But do not match their anger unless you direct it away from them. Be angry with them but not at them. In other words, pace their energy, rhythm and intensity but do not get angry at them. For example, you could say the following while matching their intensity, \"Well, that is just completely outrageous what happened to you!\" After a moment or two, begin to get calmer and more relaxed, if you have established rapport they will follow. You could follow this by telling them a story of how another situation like theirs has been resolved successfully in the past. This works because 1) you are matching their current on-going experience and sending a message of empathy instead of mismatching by trying to calm them down, 2) they feel you are listening to them and are willing to do what it takes to remedy the situation for and with them. Flexibility is Key It is absolutely essential to learn to be flexible in your behavior, as well as be willing to do so, when you are learning Rapport methods and all other methods in this course. Learning to become more flexible, to be able to communicate more effectively with a wider range of people requires practice and a willingness to do things that at first may seem strange. It is amazing just how much more effective you will become by taking a little time to practice and implement the methods. Is it Useful to Intentionally Break Rapport? It is also very important to know and realize that there are times when you may find it useful to deliberately be out of Rapport, or break Rapport with another individual. NLP, as a model, describes and defines techniques by their application and utility; when it is useful to engage in one behavior versus another. To break rapport, instead of matching, mismatch any of the above distinctions."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"True Art in Communication Is: 1. Determining what you want to occur between parties during the communication interaction. 2. Observing and hearing without bias, becoming flexible enough to alter your behavior to increase or break Rapport. 3. Having the sensory acuity to recognize whether you are getting closer to or further from what you want to occur and having the flexibility to adjust your behavior accordingly to get your outcome. Other Methods To Gain Rapport Additional to the above methods is to use the Meta Model and Milton Model, Representational Systems, Beliefs and Attitudes to pace and gain Rapport. Exercise - Leading 1. B engages A in a pleasant conversation. 2. B matches (paces) A's body posture, gestures, breath rate and language patterns. 3. When B thinks s/he has Rapport, then B leads with a body shift, gesture, etc. If Rapport has been established, person A will follow B's lead unconsciously. A's response may have a delay of 5-10 seconds and may be very subtle. 4. When B is sure A has followed his lead, then mismatch (break Rapport). This can sometimes be difficult and will require flexibility on B's part. 5. B once again matches A to regain Rapport and tests with a lead. Exercise - Matching Body Posture and Breathing 1. A and B face each other and have a pleasant conversation. B notes the body language and breath rate of A. B begins to match A. After Matching A for awhile B tests to see if Rapport is established by doing something different and watches to see if A follows. 2. Do the same exercise as above, except Match vocal qualities. 3. Do the same exercise as above, except Match predicates. Listen carefully and talk back to A in their language. After awhile, overlap or change to another Representational System predicate and notice if a shift occurs in B. 4. B goes into a negative state. A gains Rapport and tries to shift them to a productive state through Pacing and leading. 5. During conversation B paces statements back to A and then leads. Make three Pacing statements and then a leading statement."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Exercise - Matching Emotional State 1. A tells B in detail about an exciting, electrifying experience that A has had. B encourages A with gestures, body movement, voice qualities etc. C notices which of B's behaviors are most effective in encouraging A. 2. C tells A a story using the most effective behaviors of B. B notices the effect of C's story on A. Exercise - Matching Chunk Size Person A listens for the way B presents information while describing an event in B's life and determines the chunk size (big picture or details). Then A matches back the chunk size while continuing to converse with B about the event. Exercise - Matching Values and Leading B elicits values of A around some topic by asking, \"What is important to you?\". Then by pacing back the values around another topic, B attempts to lead A to some action.

When an anchor is “fired off\", it will allow you to get all or part of the feelings back from a particular experience. Anchors can be naturally occurring, or you can deliberately set an anchor for yourself or others. All experience is coded in the mind as a gestalt of sensory information in all systems (Visual, Auditory, or Kinesthetic). Whenever any component of a particular experience is \"triggered\" in any system, other components of that experience will be re-accessed to some degree. Therefore, any part of the experience can be used to access another part of the experience. Some examples of naturally occurring anchors: Your country's flag or national anthem Some habit of your spouse that elicits a less-than-glorious state in you, like scraping toast or leaving the cap off the toothpaste. Hearing the tiny voice of your child say, \"I love you Daddy/Mommy\" and it fills you with joy. Seeing a photograph that \"takes you back\" to a memory of a special moment. There is a certain way that someone touches you that makes you feel good. A certain look on your spouse's face lets you know you are in trouble. The first warm day of the spring season makes you feel good. Most of us have had the experience, in communicating with a client, friend or associate, of reaching a certain level of Rapport and understanding that was a very positive resource for both of you. Later on, the flow of the conversation, discussion or negotiation changes. The interaction becomes more tense, strained or difficult and you wish you had a way of re-accessing the positive experiences that you shared earlier. Anchoring is a process that allows you to do this. Some examples of deliberately anchoring Touch yourself or other person in a specific place for a specific length of time (knee, shoulder, arm, hands, etc.) Use a unique handshake (e.g. Touch their shoulder when you shake hands) “Mark out” words you speak with a tonal shift (called analogue marking) Raise your eyebrows every time your subject does what you want to anchor Use a unique gesture. Spatial Anchoring: use a particular space in a room Some important things to remember about Anchoring 1. Anchors do not need to be conditioned over long periods of time in order to become established. Repeated stimuli can reinforce an Anchor, but Anchors tend to promote the use of single trial learning. 2. Anchors will become established without direct rewards or reinforcements for the association. Repetition and conditioning can lead to the establishment of an Anchor,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"but they are not necessary. 3. Internal experience (cognitive behavior) is considered to be as significant as overt measurable response. In other words, NLP asserts that an internal picture, feeling, or dialogue is just as much a response as the saliva of Pavlov's dog. 4. The more intense the experience the individual is having at the time the Anchor is “set\" (the stimulus applied), the stronger the response will be when the Anchor is \"fired off\" (re-introduced) at a later time. Phobias are an example of powerful Anchors that, in most cases, are established in a single, very brief and intense learning experience. 5. When eliciting a state you wish to Anchor, be sure the person has a specific example, a single event when that state was paramount. The memory of the experience should be associated. That is, the person should remember the event as if it were happening now, seeing what they saw, hearing what they heard and feeling what they were feeling. 6. In creating an anchor, precise timing of the trigger stimulus is critical. In eliciting a state from someone, (asking them to think of a person they like, for instance), the state reaches full intensity rather quickly and then diminishes slowly. Notice the physiological changes the person goes through as they remember the event, set and release your anchor just before the experience peaks. The diagram below illustrates the ideal timing which corresponds to the peaking of the intensity of the experience. TIME Note: You can use the person’s first memory of the experience to calibrate their physiology so you know what they look like when the experience peaks. Then have them repeat the memory; this time set the anchor. 7. The more unique the stimuli (anchor) the more accurate it will be in re-accessing the desired state. In other words, the anchor will be less likely to bring with it any unwanted representations which had similar associations. S et Anchor Release Anchor INTENSITY"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 8. The more accurately the stimulus is replicated, the quicker and more accurately it will re-access what was associated with it originally. 9. When you test your Anchor, if you do not see the same physical response A. The Anchor was set too late (when the state was diminishing) B. Firing the Anchor did not precisely replicate the \"set.\" 10. Anchors can be established in any of the Representational Systems. Often, the most powerful Anchor is in the sensory system the person is least aware of. If you anchor in multiple systems (for example, touching a knee while making a sound, \"ssssss\"), it will be more powerful than using only one system. 11. Anchors can be set and fired off covertly or overtly. The fact of everyday living is that people are constantly creating and utilizing powerful Anchors covertly and most of the time doing so outside of their own conscious awareness. An exciting outcome of your training will be to gain more control of the Anchoring you do naturally, so you can produce the responses you want in others and in yourself."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Stacking Anchors Purpose: To amplify a resource state. 1.

I suggest that you grab a pencil and paper if you'd like to write down some of the methods that I am about to introduce you to. How many times have you heard people say that they are going to loose weight or stop yelling at their kids or watched your kids with their grand plans of what they are going to do, only to see them repeatedly fail at their attempts. The reason is because they have inadvertent programmed their brain to fail! We will see clearly how this occurs and how you can stop it if it's happening to you. Often what prevents people from getting their goals is fear of risk. The problem is, EVERYTHING you do requires some risk. There is a risk every time you get into a car! Successful people always access the probability of the risk occurring and the benefits of taking the risk and pursuing the goal ... and when in need, enlist the aid of others, seeking input from friend or mentor. The other thing that prevents people from getting their goals is fear of failure. If there is one thing that you take from this program and incorporate in to your life from this moment forward it should be this -- the simple concept that \"failure equals feedback\". Failure is a signal to you that you need to learn another way to do it. In NLP, we say that if what you are doing isn't working, do anything else!!! Most people do the same behavior over and over again and expect different results! If you do this, stop it! It's insane! Just do something else, anything else. Remember Babe Ruth. He had the most strike outs AND the most home runs ! Anything worth doing well is worth doing poorly at first. After all, when was the last time you became an expert at something after you did it once? Learn to look at fear from a new perspective and realize you will not achieve significant goals without some failures. Do you doubt your skills? Don't believe you can do it with what you have - what will you do to increase your confidence? - learn from other people who are getting the results you want, get practice, do training programs, get a coach and confront the situation boldly. Establish a realistic standard for success and work toward it. When attempting something new, think: what skills or behaviors are needed? Then go out and learn them. Changing isn't always easy, anything that is unfamiliar is worth doing - if change is scary, admit it, do a little at a time, try to seek out change (for a change) and begin to view yourself as one who likes and looks forward to change. Do lots of little new things, new restaurants and foods, new friends and acquaintances, new books of different genres. Too busy? Prioritize those things of most value and pursue those."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Goal Setting rules of NLP 1. You must state goals in the positive -- what you do want, not what you don't want. Nature abhors a vacuum. State what you want not what you don't want. The brain deletes negatives. 2. You must be able to represent it to yourself by way of the 5 senses. How do you see it, hear it, taste it, smell it, and feel it? Where do you feel it, where do you want it, when and with whom? 3. You must be able to start or initiate your action independently and be able to carry it out independently. It is what you can do and not what others do that counts. How will you start it and how will you carry it through to the end result? 4. The goal you are attempting to attain does not interfere in any negative ways with your natural life state and that of others. Is there anything that you would have to give up or sacrifice when you make the change? How will you and others around you be effected? Good sub questions to ask yourself about this goal. What will having this goal do for me? (gets you larger outcome and additional motivation)? What prevents me from having it right now? Is this realistic? (When answering this question you will most likely find something that you can do or change right away today to make getting your goal possible.) Is this goal a manageable size or is it too large for a first step? What steps do I need to take in order to get this goal? What resources do I have available to me right now to assist me in getting my goal? Go and review five times when you were successful and see what you did --What did you say to yourself? What were you doing? How did you look, sound and move? Find at least five times and feel how good it feels to be resourceful. When you’ve found some powerful times, move them closer, make them brighter and in full color to intensify those experiences for yourself. When I have my goal, what will I be seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling and feeling that will let me know I have it? What will happen if you make the change (both good and bad)? What could (if it were to) go wrong? Who else will this goal effect? Are there any possible negative consequences? Is there anyone who might possibly object to you making this change or having this goal? When and where do you want this change (It is very important to specify time and the context)? What is going to happen when you make this change? What is -not going to happen when you make this change? What is going to happen if you don't make this change (What is the consequence if you don't make the change)? What is not going to happen if you don't make this change?

The external information that we take in through our senses is represented inside our minds in the form of internal pictures, sounds, and feelings. These are called modalities - visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Modalities are nothing new. Visualization and self-talk programs have been around for years. What distinguishes NLP is that the developers discovered that more was involved than just visualizing. What was missing in them was the smaller components they called Submodalities. Submodalities are the variables within the modalities. For example: in visual -is the picture in color or in black and white, in auditory - is the sound soft or loud, in kinesthetic - is the feeling spreading all over or just in one spot? If a person makes a picture of themselves being motivated- but they make it small, dark and in black and white - they are not likely to become motivated. On the other hand, if the person makes the same picture bright, colorful, 40 feet tall by 40 feet wide, and add surround sound, they tend to be much more motivated. This is obviously a very simplistic example, but the implications for personal change are immense. In NLP, we call this running your own brain. If there was an owner's manual for your brain, it would be Submodalities. When you work with Submodalities, you are directly manipulating the structural components of a person’s internal experience. You are working with the level at which experience is coded. By far, it is the most precise technology for altering (re-coding) a person’s thinking process. It is important to realize you are not changing behaviors directly. Rather, you are altering states and perceptions which influence the likelihood of a person changing their behavior. Characteristics of Submodalities Submodalities represent the level at which experience is coded. Submodalities are homeostatic, which means if one Submodality changes, then the whole system adjusts in some way to the change. Analog Distinctions. Some Submodality distinctions can be varied gradually (e.g., from smaller to bigger). Linguistic cues that can help identify analog characteristics are adjectives with \"er\" suffixes. In the Meta Model, these are referred to as Comparatives. Digital Distinctions. Digital Distinctions are either one way or the other. Perceptual position is a digital distinction - an image is either associated or dissociated, which means you are either in the picture or out of the picture. Foreground/background, shape, color/black & white, still/movement are all examples of digital distinctions."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Synesthesia or Synergistic Effects When chaining a component of a Submodality, you can get Synesthesia or synergistic effects. For Example: When you vary one element - like \"proximity\" or \"distance\" - other Submodality distinctions automatically vary. This can happen within one system or between different systems. For example, when you make a picture come closer, size and brightness will often change (one system change). Or, when an image brightens, feelings often intensify (change in a different system). An example of Synesthesia is often described as \"see blood, feel sick\". Some linguistic clues: \"A bright feeling\", \"loud colors\", \"warm tones\". The Critical Submodalities The difference between two states is typically created by only 3 or 4 Submodality distinctions, called Critical Submodalities. These Critical Submodalities are the ones you want to use when you are working with someone. When you are uncovering the Critical Submodalities, remember not to elicit the experiences separately. Elicit Submodalities from the different experiences simultaneously, and note only the differences. If certain ones are the same (For example: if both pictures are bright), then ignore that distinction.

Association enables you to access a resource state. It enables you to be \"fully\" in the experience and allows you to rehearse some behavior or activity. To associate into a past experience, see the experience and step into it. Surround yourself with the feelings, sights and sounds that you felt, saw and heard at the time. You can also pretend to engage in a behavior by mentally and behaviorally rehearsing it. Dissociation enables you to view a situation from different perspectives, to more objectively assess or evaluate a situation. It enables you to separate yourself from pain or overwhelming unpleasant feelings. It enables you to watch models and \"watch yourself\" rehearse behaviors. To dissociate from a past experience, mentally visualize yourself \"over there\" on a movie screen or in a picture. You can use a sheet of Plexiglas to separate you, the watcher, from you, the actor.

Now, step into the circle again and bring all those feelings back. Wrap them around you. 8. Just as the feeling begins to subside, step out of the circle again, leaving all those feelings in the circle. Note: Notice the underlined words. Be sure your language reflects the associated and disassociated language. Applications: You can take your circle with you where ever you go. You can place the circle on the floor of your bedroom next to your bed so that every morning when you get up, you can step into your circle of excellence. You could also place the circle on the pavement outside your car door so that when you go to important meetings or sales calls, your circle of excellence helps you to be resourceful. Another idea is to place it in front of the front door of your house so that after work, you come home in a resourceful state."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Submodality Interventions Association/Disassociation For example: See yourself (disassociated) instead of seeing through your own eyes as if you were there (associated). Change Any One Element: For Example: Within the visual system, you can change the brightness or the size. Within the auditory system, you could vary the location or loudness of the sound. Delete Elements: Modality Deletions. For Example: If the sound in a movie is unpleasant turn it off. Content Deletions. For Example: You can remove the background, people and/or certain objects. Add Elements: Modality Additions. For Example: If a movie doesn't have any sound, add a sound track. Content Additions. For Example: In a picture, you can only add content that isn't there. If, when you see yourself doing a certain activity, and you add people, it makes the activity look like more fun, then add the appropriate person or persons. Contrastive Analysis and Critical Submodalities: Elicit two different states and elicit the Submodalities of each state. Contrastive Analysis is when you catalog and contrast the differences in the Submodalities. The difference between two states is typically created by only 3 or 4 Submodality distinctions, called Critical Submodalities. Once you have determined the Critical Submodalities, you can use them to shift one state into another. Mapping Across: Shift one state into another by making the configuration of Submodalities the same. For Example: Changing a Limitation State into a Resource State. Find out what the configuration of Submodalities are for each state and then make the configuration of Submodalities for the “limitation\" state the same as the Submodalities of the \"Resource\" state."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Practice Session - Submodalities and Anchoring The patterns you are learning are important patterns for personal evolution and for assisting others to make changes. Each pattern is part of a whole, like nested Russian dolls. The last few days of the Practitioner Program are dedicated to integrating the material you have covered. Many of our participants comment on how the material really \"came together\" in the last few days. For you to benefit most from this training program it is important for you to continue to have outrageous amounts of fun when you practice each area you are learning. Those who receive the greatest rewards are those who adopt the curious, playful attitude and commit to experimenting and applying what they learn each and every day. People who become serious about NLP become stifled in their creativity. Set daily practice goals (Well-formed Outcomes) that you can achieve alone or with study group partners. Make it a part of each day to focus on succeeding even in small areas of your life. Soon you may find yourself absolutely surprised and delighted to begin to notice how the other areas are changing too. And take credit for the changes you are making. Live, love and laugh enjoying each day to the fullest with passion and fun! The following are some suggested exercises you can play with. 1. Practice listening for Submodality distinctions in other people's conversation. EXAMPLE “I had a bright idea.\" \"The future looks dim\" \"All I get is static from him.\" \"She is a warm person and I tingle all over just thinking about her.\" 2. Practice eliciting Submodalities - do contrastive analysis on other's experience. 3. Spend time making pictures, paying attention to internal sounds and internal feelings. Devote five to 15 minutes a day. 4. Each day spend specific time practicing associating into pleasant experiences and dissociating from unpleasant ones. This is tremendously valuable skill and you will want to master it so that your brain will automatically do it for you. You can use the Circle of Excellence if you want. 5. Practice the Swish Pattern and Belief Change (see later in the manual) with yourself or others. Remember to pick minor problems and goals to start with so that you can \"wire in” the pattern before moving on to larger issues. 6. Practice Anchoring positive responses from others and yourself. Choose visual Anchors one day, kinesthetic Anchors the next day, and auditory Anchors the following day. Practice using precision when you set Anchors."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Introduction To NLP Techniques For Personal Change Submodalities are not an NLP technique. Submodalities are what is used and affected when NLP techniques are applied. Submodalities are how we, as human beings structure our experience. It is the coding system of the brain that lets us know the difference between states and experiences, whether we are happy or depressed, procrastinating or motivated, attracted or not. Submodalities are what makes up subjective human experience. Since many Submodalities seem to affect most people the same way, we have made generalizations concerning them, i.e. making something brighter intensifies the feeling. It's important, however to realize that everyone has their own unique coding system, and whenever something seems to be an absolute, it's not. Generalizations are an important part of the learning process. They are also the biggest stumbling block. True elegance in NLP is one's ability to observe, elicit information and test what seems to be true until a result occurs... hopefully, it will be the result you wanted. If what you end up with is not what you wanted, find another way, a new twist or perhaps some technique that you are not yet aware of. Remember If what you are doing Isn't working, do anything else! Many of the interventions on the following pages represent useful techniques that have been developed using the NLP Submodality technology. It is important to keep in mind that the field of NLP is NOT a set of techniques. NLP is an attitude and a methodology that leaves behind a trail of techniques. Much of NLP is taught as a set of techniques simply because the techniques can be extremely powerful ways to effect change in people. The problem is that if you only know the techniques, then you won't know what do when unexpected situations come up. For example, since the NLP Phobia Cure relies on the person making pictures in their mind, ask yourself the question, \"How do I work with a person who has a phobia of making pictures?\" Remember: The person with the most flexibility (the person who understand the methodology, not just the techniques) in any given situation is the person who wins. The NLP attitude is one of wanton curiosity and tenacity. The technology would not exist today if the developers did not possess a wildly curious and tenacious attitude. In the same sense, NLP becomes lifeless, cold, and less effective when separated from this attitude. Life becomes more fun and pleasurable when you begin to adopt a curiosity and tenacity that propels you into the future. The NLP Practitioner has the flexibility to notice when what they are doing isn't working and the tenacity do anything else until they achieve their outcome."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"The methodology of NLP is the \"how\": how to get from point A to point B. The NLP practitioner does not want to know why a chocolate cake is chocolate. And s/he doesn't want to know why someone has a phobia. The question \"why\" will give you the least useful information. You want to know how the cake is made and how the person is able to make themselves terrified. This information is useful because you can then use it to help the person achieve their outcome. The NLP practitioner has the curiosity to find out what ingredients went into the cake so that they can duplicate it or change it. Also, you want to know how to work backwards in case someone has a secret recipe."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Resource Triangle The Resource Triangle is NLP in a nutshell. It is the basis for all the NLP techniques. If you learn only one technique in NLP, learn this one. You can basically make up your own techniques when you follow this as the basic model. 1. Identify a \"stuck” state. A stuck state is an un-resourceful state or problem state where you feel less-than-glorious. 2. Get three cards or sheets of paper. Write the letter S (for Stuck State) on one card. On the other, write the letter D (for Disassociated), and the third card, write the letter R (for Resource). Place the cards on the floor in a triangle. 3. Briefly, step onto the \"S\" or Stuck State card and associate into the stuck state, but only for a brief second or two. 4. Disassociate from the problem state and step onto the \" \"D\" card, leaving all those feelings over there (point to the \"S\" card). 5. While still remaining on the \"D\" card, turn and look toward the \"R\" card. Identify a resource that would be appropriate to the problem. For example, choose humor, confidence, playfulness, curiosity, etc. See the resource over there (point tot he \"R\" card). See the \"younger you\". 6. Look over at the resource card and know that in a minute you are going to step onto that card and fully associate into that resource. Now, step onto the \"R\" card and wrap the resource around you fully. Feel all the feelings, see what you were seeing at the time, hear what you were hearing at the time. Feel this state in your entire body. 7. When you have completely associated into the resource, step onto the \"S\" card and step into the problem state, taking all these positive feelings with you. Take a moment and let this integrate. 8. Step outside the triangle. Take a deep breath and notice how the problem is different. What new solutions are now available to you that were not available before? What is new? Note: If needed, you can repeat the exercise. It is very important to build a very powerful resource -- one that is more powerful than the stuck state, so that it even makes the stuck state seem wimpy when compared with the resource. If needed, stack a few resource states together under one anchor so that the resource state is very intense.

It is designed both as a starting place to learn about how to use basic Submodalities (size, brightness, location, association and dissociation) and how to set up generative change. Generative change has a direction built into it, with nothing left to chance or random outcomes. The Swish Pattern is used to create behavioral changes, going from a present undesirable behavior to a future, desired replacement behavior, Swish Pattern Steps 1. Choose a current behavior you would like to change. 2. Choose a replacement behavior. 3. Create a square picture of seeing yourself (dissociated) having the new behavior. This picture should, when you look at it, give you the good feelings you will have about yourself when you have made this change. 4. Create another square picture of seeing what it is that triggers the current behavior, seeing through your own eyes (associated) and having the feelings that you now have, when you have the old behavior. EXAMPLE: Seeing chocolate and feeling hungry. Once you have this picture let it fade out (or do a break state) before going to step 5. 5. Now take the big, bright picture of the current behavior (seeing what you saw when it was triggered), and in the lower left hand corner of the picture, put a small dark image of you having the replacement behavior. 6. Now take the big bright one and make it dark while taking the smaller one in the corner and making it bigger and brighter until it completely covers the whole thing. Then open your eyes and reorient to the room (break state). It is very important to reorient to the room at this point otherwise you could create a chain going from problem state to desired state back to problem state. In other words, you could create a loop unless you break state between the steps. 7. Repeat step 6 five times as rapidly as possible opening your eyes (breaking state) between each run. 8. Go back and look at what used to trigger the old behavior and notice how your feelings have changed. Variations: If, when you learn about your own Critical Submodalities, you find the location is a strong influence on what motivates you, place the small, dark picture of the new behavior in the location where motivation is, then continue the pattern from there. Have one picture way off in the distance and the other picture closer to you. Swish them by changing locations."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Confusion to Understanding In the process of learning, the purpose is to go from confusion, or lack of understanding, to a point where you understand. Some people run across the problem that when they are confused, they feel frustrated, or they don't believe that they can learn what it is that will make them understand. Therefore, being able to go from confusion to understanding in a deliberate fashion can make learning something that can be enjoyable and add more delight and fun to your life. This is an exercise to assist you in the process starting right now. It is strongly suggested that you do this exercise with someone else, someone who also knows something about Submodalities, and someone who will save your Submodality list for future understanding. Confusion to Understanding Steps 1. Pick a memory of something that you are confused about, but would like to understand more. 2. Next, pick a memory of something you understand. 3. With your partner asking the questions and taking notes on the Submodality list, begin to compare your internal representation of what you understand and what you are confused about by going back and forth from one representation to the other. List the differences. EXAMPLE: One is a movie while the other is a slide. One is panoramic while the other is bordered, etc. 4. Once you have gone through the entire list, have your partner assist you in changing your confused memory into the same Submodalities as the understanding memory, changing whatever is different from confusion to understanding. 5. Now look at what you were confused about. Do you feel like you understand it? If not, compare it with what you understand and go back and find the other differences you missed. Summary Do you understand what you were confused about? What does that say about content? This exercise is a demonstration that people usually know more than they thought, and that learning can be easier. In order to be confused about something, you must have some knowledge of it. If you are confused, it only means that you haven't yet organized the data in a way that you completely understand now. It's easier when you have organized the data because now you can find out what else you may need to learn."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Using Someone Else's Learning Style The following exercise gives you the opportunity to \"try on\" the Submodalities of another person’s learning style.

You can teach people new skills if they are alive and can feed back information to you. However, if a person believes that they can’t do something, they are going to find a way to unconsciously keep the change from occurring. One kind of belief is the belief that something is possible. This means that you believe that your goal or outcome is a real possibility. If you do not believe that something is possible, you won't act upon it and the usual response is hopelessness. No belief that it is possible = Hopelessness Another kind of belief is the belief that something is possible and that you have the whatever it takes to reach your goal. This means that you believe that you have the resources to accomplish whatever you set your mind to. Another version of this is when a person believes something is possible for others, but not possible for themselves. A person with these beliefs ends up helpless and does not take action to better their life. No belief in own resources = Helplessness A third type of belief has to do with expectancy. What we expect usually comes true, right? If a person does not expect to accomplish the goals, then they will not take any action to head in that direction. Another version of this is the placebo effect. Studies prove that when people believe and expect they will feel better after taking a drug, they do, even when it was just a sugar pill. No expectancy = no action In the NLP Master Practitioner training, we fully delve into beliefs; how to detect beliefs in a person’s language, how they function, how to quickly change them just by using your own language, and how they operate. in conjunction with everything else. In Practitioner level training, you'll begin by discovering how to change your own limiting beliefs into compelling new ones. It is very powerful to have the ability to change your limiting beliefs. Is there something that you believe, that if you stopped believing it, life would be better? What if you believe something else that creates more ecstasy and passion in your life?

In all Phobic cases there is an image of an event which generates the phobic response. A generalized fear is different than a phobia and usually does not respond well to the Phobia cure. A fear is where a person can still engage in an the activity but is uncomfortable. A true Phobia is one where the person cannot engage in the activity or go near the object of fear at all. In fact, even the thought of the activity or object produces intense fear and usually extreme behavior. 1. Establish a powerful (stacked) anchor for feeling safe and secure (Al) and an anchor (A2) to access the event. 2. Establish a beginning and an end to the event. Instruct the subject to go to a time after the event has transpired and is over, a time where he knows he is safe and secure and to visualize his younger self. Instruct the subject to project that image as a small black and white frozen slide image onto a wall (S1). Break state / pattern interrupt. Next instruct the subject to visualize his younger self moments before the event took place and project that image (S2) as a slide on the wall in the same location. NOTE: In those instances where a person was dissociated from the event, have him change perspective - see it from another vantage point than he did originally. In other words, in an instance where the person saw an accident, have that person now watch himself watch the accident from a different location. 3. When the subject can see himself in the safe place before the event began, instruct him to float out of his present body to a place directly behind himself where he can watch himself watch himself. This establishes three place dissociation. Use the analogy of a movie house and anchor the dissociation (A3). 4. Fire and hold the comfort and security anchor (A1) and the dissociation anchor (M) and instruct the subject to start and watch the movie of his younger self go through the event all the way to the end stopping on (S1) - safety after the event transpired. 5.

At each point that he notices that feeling (through a Kinesthetic sensation), he can make a mental note and continue backwards to the very first experience of that sensation. 4. When the subject reaches the very first experience of that sensation, he steps off the Timeline to the left and looks at the memory on the Timeline. He sees his younger dissociated self, the event and the people around him. Next, he steps over the Timeline to the right and looks at the memory from another perspective. After the subject has gathered information about the event from different perspectives, he walks back along the side of his Timeline to where he had oriented himself in the present. 5.

Now I Don't Want You To Have Too Much Fun Learning These Words, Because You Shouldn't Enjoy Yourself Now. When You Don't Try Too Hard, You Just Get Excited. Don't The brain does not process negatives. Therefor, when you use the word, \"Don't\", the brain must first make a representation of what it is that it is NOT supposed to think and then cancel it. This is more evident in children than in adults. For example, \"Don't spill your milk\" often produces the effect of the child spilling their milk. Adults can understand a negative more easily, but if you want to be more clear in your communication, it is better to state what you want, instead of what you don't want. But The word \"but\" will negate anything that comes before it. It is important that you use it with care so that you are not unintentionally sending the wrong message. For example: \"I think you are really smart, but you need to work harder.” Instead, it may be more useful to say, “I think you are very smart, and you need to work harder.” Should Do you do your \"shoulds?\" Not very often I bet. Most people do their \"shouldn'ts\" more often! If you are attempting to persuade someone, telling them they should do it will not be very persuasive usually. On the other hand, you can use the word \"shouldn't\" in wonderful ways. For example: \"You shouldn't enjoy your self too much now!\" Try Using the word \"try\" implies failure. Think about what is \"pre-supposed\" in the following sentence: \"She tried to finish the marathon.” What is presupposed (or what has to be there for the sentence to make sense) is that she did NOT finish the marathon. When you use the word \"try\", you are implying either failure or the possibility of failure. If Sometimes it is better to substitute the word “if” with the word \"when\". This can be more persuasive. For example, notice the difference between, “If you decide to register for the seminar...\" or \"When you decide to register for the seminar...\""},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Rex's Rules If you are in sales, if you are a therapist, a parent, or a significant other, you want to get people's attention. Sometimes other people are in states of hysteria, states of euphoria, states of anger, sadness, confidence, joy... and if you are selling them on any idea or notion in your mind; you first need to get their attention and entrain it. Entrainment is the scientific description for what happens when people are in rapport. The main thing is to bond so that their attention gets connected to you and/or what you are offering them. You create these incredible states inside the other person, and then you amplify them and anchor them to yourself or your product. Amplify and connect! You can connect feelings to yourself or your product or to a resource that they have or want. If you are a therapist, you connect it up to where it will be most useful and beneficial to them. When I say you connect it up to yourself, I am talking \"win-win” here. The reason why we elicit values is so that it is in alignment with their values. Because if you connect up all this stuff with what they truly value, if you leverage it against their criteria, their rules and their values -- “boom\" you have them held! If you have their outcome and your outcome in mind, you will create win-win. The same thing is true if you want people to go into hypnotic states of consciousness because what we are doing is hypnotic. Rex's Rules 1. States don't exist. States are only processes. Your hand exists, the chair exists, the floor exists, but states don't exist. States are processes. We know that a process is something that starts, has a middle and an end somewhere within a period of time. 2. When you change the state you change the decision. Decisions occur inside of states (which don't exist). Decisions are made inside of a state (inside a moment of time). Hence, change the state and you change the decision. Change the state and you change the limitation. Change the state and you change the behavior. 3. Use everything. Your job as a professional communicator is to create the states you want inside the other person using everything you have learned - every skill you have -- your body, your voice, how you use your body, how you use your voice, the look on your face, how you use space, how you talk, your language - everything! As a professional communicator, this is your arsenal. This is your tool box. Your body, your voice is like a musical instrument. Play it like an exquisite musician. 4. Always communicate with an outcome or purpose in mind. Know your outcome. Have sensory acuity, utilize feedback and take action. Your"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"outcome is your reason for communicating, for being there. Always know what you want in advance of the communication interaction. The purpose of communication is to get a result. That is the only purpose for communicating. If you enjoy discussing philosophical concepts and you just like to chat over coffee because it gives you a rush discussing lofty notions and ideas -- that is a purpose to get your point across. Other examples include: to get someone to do something, take an action, change their point of view, agree with you, to illicit a promise. If you think in terms of results then it goes back to a well-formed outcome - know your outcome and know whether you are moving closer to it or away from it by using your sensory acuity. 5. Your tonality is everything. It is how you say it that is most important. Tonality is everything. You can describe any concept or state and if your tonality doesn't support the words you are using the other person will not go into the state you want them in. You must be one hundred per cent congruent. 6. Always move from the least intrusive maneuver to the most intrusive maneuver. That is why we use hypnotic language softeners. The whole purpose for using your language is so that you can take any notion and soften it up, so that it becomes palatable for just about anyone. You can essentially suggest anything to anyone in a way that makes it absolutely irresistible to them. 7. Never, never resist anything you are offered. Instead, use it. Don't try to stop or resist anything you are offered inside a communication. Don't try to prevent it. Instead, use it and redirect it. This is what Reframing is all about. This is what sleight of mouth patterns are about. 8. Go first! This means if you want someone else to become excited, you go into the state of excitement first. This way, you will entrain them into excitement. If they get into rapport with you because of your pacing and leading, and then you go into a hypnotic state, they get to join you there. This cuts down the amount of work you have to do. If you are not in state, they are not going to go into state either. 9. There is no difference between a highly detailed visualization and a real world event. The brain does not know the difference between a detailed, associated visualization and a real event. We know this to be true because when people visualize themselves in a sporting activity they actually use the very same muscles they use when actually engaged in that activity. This is also why the technique “Change Personal History” works so well - history didn’t really change, but we have fooled the brain into thinking it did! The problem with most people is that they review in their mind, in a highly detailed fashion, all of their screw ups, faults, problems, and stuck states. What they should do is stick those in the trash under the sink and review what they want to occur instead. Since practice is rehearsal and review equals rehearsal, then you get what you review because you rehearse it.

Speaking indirectly is a very powerful form of communication because it eliminates the conscious interference and speaks directly to the unconscious mind. Language Softeners Language Softeners allow you to suggest ideas in an atmosphere of rapport. In other words, it \"takes the edge off”. Examples: If you were to.... If I were to..., What is it like when you .... As you.... It is not necessary to.... You really shouldn't.... Have you ever..., I’m wondering .... What if you could... Qualifiers Qualifiers serve to define HOW something will occur. They specify the process. For example, \"How quickly will you be able to naturally learn easily?\" Examples: naturally, automatically, easily, elegantly, understandably, effortlessly, smoothly, honestly, cleanly, gracefully Awareness Predicates Awareness predicates draw the listener's attention to their awareness and away from whether or not your statement is true or not. For example, notice the difference in the following two sentences: This pen will make you feel delighted. Will you buy one? Are you aware of how delighted you will be when you buy this pen? Examples: wonder, aware, realize, understand, know, already, notice Temporal Predicates Temporal predicates allow you to orient a person’s experience in time. It allows you to presuppose things as well. For example, \"Before you register for this seminar, what types of questions can I answer for you?” Examples: before, during, after, then, now, was, is, soon, look ahead, would be, already"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Cause and Effect The Cause-Effect structure is often referred to as Causal Modeling. Causal Modeling is setting up a process where the listener pays attention to a particular aspect of what you are saying and connects or links it to another aspect. You are essentially establishing a connection between two experiences so that when one experience occurs, the other necessarily follows. For example, “The sound of my voice can cause you to become sleepy.\" Examples: cause, because, and, since, as, while, before, after, during Transitional Words Use transitional words to guide a person easily and naturally into a state. These also are collectively referred to as Temporal Predicates. When you use transitional words, you are implying that part of a sentence relates to another part of a sentence. For example: \"As you read this manual, you can begin to imagine in how many different ways you will use this material in your daily life.\" Examples: when, as, if, even as, while, since, before, during, after, because, successively, in order to, previously, consequently, so that Embedded Commands Embedded commands are \"marked out\" (see below) and are used to indirectly suggest ideas into your listener's mind. It is important to begin your conversation with commands and continue to use them over the entire conversation. One, single embedded command is not enough for the unconscious mind to pick up. For example, “I want you to stop and consider enjoying yourself completely as you continue to listen to my voice so that now, and in the future, you can listen to my voice inside your mind whenever you need to, want to, or choose to.” Analog Marking Embedded Commands usually make more impact at the unconscious level when simultaneously delivered with some form of analog marking. Marking an Embedded Command is accomplished by attaching some non-verbal aspect of your external behavior, for example, a change in voice tone and/or tempo, raising or lowering the volume of your voice, or a discrete visual gesture. Analog marking sets the particular phrase apart from the rest of the sentence for special attention by a person’s unconscious mind. This is referred to as Multi-Level Communication. The listener should not notice the analog marking consciously. Analog marking is also an excellent example of Anchoring."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Quotes This pattern allows you to indirectly deliver messages. This is accomplished by relaying what somebody else said and/or did at another time and place. Since you are apparently talking about somebody else, the listener may often respond to (associate with) the message that you want to deliver. For example, \"A friend of mine told me that if I continue to dig in and work hard , that my grades will automatically go up.\" Use Of Negation When we say, \"Don't think of the color green\", or \"Don't think of all the exciting ways you are going to use these language patterns.\" Since the brain does not process negatives, you have to first think of the \"color green\" and \"exciting ways\" in order to understand the sentences. You can use negation to skillfully suggest ideas. Stacking Presuppositions Stacking Presuppositions is simply what it's name implies: stacking or chaining together one presupposition after another. The more that you include in one sentence, the more confused the listener with become and the more access you will have to the unconscious portion of their experience. Example: \"I don't know how quickly you will fully realize how much you have already learned in this course and as you continue to study this I wonder if you are aware of your unconscious ability to learn even more now as you read these words on this paper and discover new ideas floating up in your mind over and over again, don't you?\" Use Of \"Or\" The use of the word \"or\" creates an illusion of choice which allows you to suggest ideas to people without directly ordering them to do so. The typical example is, \"will this be check or charge?\" which gives the customer the illusion of choice all the while the sentence presupposes that they are going to make a purchase. Other examples: Would you like me to read you a story before or after you have your bath? I don't know whether it will be your right hand or your left hand that will lift first..."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Milton Model The Milton Model is a way of using your language to become more persuasive with others, and to skillfully suggest ideas. The model comes from the work of Milton Erickson, who is perhaps the greatest hypnotist who ever lived. His work was \"broken down\" to a simple form by NLP researchers who then applied this to persuading people respectfully in many contexts. The Milton Model is used in every day language as well as in traditional therapeutic hypnosis to suggest changes by directing the person to pay attention to something they haven't yet thought of, in a way that is sometimes outside of their conscious awareness. The person will then come up with a new resolution, new choice, or new awareness on their own, usually without knowing of your involvement in this process. This is NOT about having the person \"under your influence\", nor does it take away a person’s free will to choose. However, you can use it create an environment where it is more likely that the subject will engage in the behavior. How does it work? Your brain has two hemispheres that share certain functions and perform others independently. Typically, the left hemisphere processes our conscious understanding of language and the right hemisphere processes the meaning of our language, outside of our conscious awareness. Using the Milton Model, you will purposely overload the conscious left hemisphere, thereby distracting it so that you can suggest meaning to the right hemisphere. Isn't this manipulative? Yes, it can be used to manipulate people to make them happier! It is a very powerful tool and like any power tool, it can be used for good or evil. At IDEA Seminars, we screen people in the workshops to make sure that they will use the material the way in which it is intended. We've even dismissed a couple people from workshops who were not very ethical in the use of the material. Although, the majority of people who attend our workshops are using the material for good. One of the advantages of knowing the Milton Model is that you will \"protect\" yourself from being manipulated by unscrupulous individuals. You can use Milton Model skills in: Business • Quickly create positive associations to you and your name, like magic • Learn how to present your ideas in ways that are irresistible • Create high performance states of mind for yourself or others • Solve problems easily even with people who gave you difficufty in the past • Negotiate more effectively than before"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"• Persuade the difficult prospect to \"see your point of view\" • Structure your language so that objections never come up! • Sell more in a shorter amount of time Personal • Develop the kind of personal romantic relationships you want • Re-create old and build new lasting relationships • Influence your spouse, clients, friends and children • Discover how important good voice tonality is to any communication • Win a special project or favor from your boss • Help a sick friend to become healthy quickly • Assist your children to make good choices for themselves"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Milton Model Patterns 1. Conjunctions: Conjunction are ways of linking experiences together to imply some kind of connection between them. The connections do not have to be logical. They can be illogical. A) Implied Simultaneity: And .... But, (and not) \"You can look at me and feel an increasing sense of curiosity.\" \"You can sometimes seem confused, but continue to learn easily.\" B) Implied Causatives: Since, As, While, Before, After, During, etc. \"Since you are here, you can easily learn in new and different ways. In fact, the more you do, the easier it becomes.\" \"As people learn these patterns, they think of creative ways to use them. Because you are learning, you can use them.\" C) Cause-Effect (Direct Causatives): \"Learning these language patterns will make possible for you to pace a person’s on-going experience.\" 2. Embedded Questions: Embedded questions provides a way to embed a command within a question. Even though it is structurally not a question, it is usually responded to as a question. “I’m wondering if you can tell me what you want.\" \"I’m curious if you can learn differently.\" \"I’m asking myself if you can practice these patterns and have fun .\" 3. Embedded Commands: This structure provides a way to deliver a double message -- one message is communicated to the conscious mind via words and another is processed by the unconscious mind via analogue marking, e.g. shifts in tonality, or visual cues to give the command a higher signal value. \"While you are practicing these patterns, you can be curious as you have fun and learn more .\" 4. Quotes: This structure offers you the flexibility of communicating a message to another person and associating the content to another speaker and another context. \"I have a friend who is very creative and knows how to enjoy new and different learning situations.\" 5. Conversational Postulates: This structure provides a way to embed a command within a question. The typical response to a conversational postulate is the subject acting upon the command, rather than answering your question. For example, \"Can you tell me what you want?\" - the subject will usually respond by telling you what s/he wants instead of replying, “Yes. I can tell you what I want.” (Usually if someone answers like this we call them a smart a __.) 6.

Linguistically, they are what must be there for the sentence to make sense, rather than what is directly stated. Every sentence in the English language contains presuppositions. Thus, when we speak, presuppositions are automatically accepted. In other words, what we are assuming to be true is automatically accepted by the listener as true because of the structure of our sentence. For example, if I say, “Would you like red or white wine with dinner?\", you automatically assume that you will be having wine. I did not ask, “Would you like some wine?\", I simply asked you what kind of wine you will be having. Wow! The fact that a listener will automatically assume that what we imply to be true, is actually true means that we can use this to our advantage to become more persuasive with others! We can also “clean up\" our own language to help us make our own changes as well. After you learn about presuppositions, go back to “Deciding What Beliefs to Change” and read what you wrote down.

So I want you to take a deep breath and realize and pay attention and focus on the fact that when you take a deep, deep breath ... just the act of taking a deep breath causes your body and your mind to relax. So with each and every breath you take you can relax further and deeper ... and more fully so... because when you allow yourself to simply let go into pleasure and relax ... you can also allow your eyes to close... because as you do that very thing you can discover for yourself increasing states of comfort... increasing states of pleasure ... arising and moving through you... if you will allow it to be so ... and that means you’re able ... to get more in touch with your own neurology... you’re own physiology... to pay attention to the exquisite sensations which reside inside you, to delight you and fascinate you... because if you could allow yourself to be captivated by an exquisite wonderful sensation inside your body... which one would you chose to allow yourself to become fully intrigued by it as it moves through you... You chose the feeling by paying attention ... and as you pay attention to any feeling ... you can notice and discover ... how it can and does intensify... and that means that you can deliberately do things to make yourself feel wonderful.

The Meta Model allows us to recover that information. The information that is deleted, distorted and generalized is called deep structure. When we recover deep structure, we are assisting people in learning more about themselves. In Structure of Magic Vol. 1, Bandler and Grinder state, “The basic principle here is that people end up in pain, not because the world is not rich enough to allow them to satisfy their needs, but because their representation of the world is impoverished. Correspondingly, then, the strategy that we as [practitioners] adopt is to connect the client with the world in some way that gives him richer choices.\" The Meta Model: Modeling Basics The Meta Model is the basis for being able to model excellence. It is a means for uncovering the structure of a person’s thinking processes and perceptions. All of us have very unique ways in which we organize and describe the world around us, and few of us understand how it works to shape our world. By using the Meta Model, you will be able uncover the deletions, distortions and generalizations in another person’s thinking process. You will discover what they absolutely will not accept and what they would consider a possibility. How does it work? The Meta Model is a set of linguistic distinctions. Using these distinctions, we can accurately determine what is missing from someone's description, or how they distort information when presenting ideas. We learn to understand how it is that people create their own limitations and what path they need to follow in order to free themselves from their limitations. It clarifies thinking by getting the individual to focus on what they usually do not focus on consciously -how they think. People who are skilled in the use of the Meta Model assist people in knowing what they need and when. They are the best negotiators, the top salespeople, and they enjoy warm, super successful relationships. The Importance of Distinctions During this program, you will learn to make critical distinctions in language. This is very important because the more precise distinctions you make, the more influential you will be. Great artists, painters, sculptors, architects and designers are able to observe and make more discriminations visually than the average person. Talented composers make more distinctions about sounds, melody, and rhythm. Athletes make more distinctions about their body, feelings, movements and timing. Just like these great talents, you will become sensitized to making more distinctions in the area of language. Since all of us use language it makes sense that those most successful"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"have learned to make distinctions in language that others have not.

Remember you do not have to question every distinction - only those that will get you the information you want. 8. Continue to practice Calibration, sensory specific language, anchoring, resource states and Submodality elicitation and Milton Model patterns. Build on the skills and principles you are learning each weekend. The patterns you are learning each session are important patterns for personal evolution and for assisting others to make changes. Each pattern is part of a whole, like nested Russian dolls. For you to continue to benefit most from this training program, it is important for you to continue to practice each area you are learning. Those who receive the greatest rewards are those who commit to making a difference in their lives by rigorously applying what they learn each and every day. Eventually you will begin to see how everything fits and works together. These models are about the structure of communication with another person as well as one self. While learning and practicing, it is equally important for you to maintain an optimum learning state. You can learn quickest when you relax, be curious and maintain an outrageous sense of fun. Set daily practice goals (Well-formed Outcomes) that you can achieve alone or with study group partners. Make it a part of each day to focus on succeeding even in small areas of your life.
