I recall that sunny day, with all my friends standing on that ledge with me, chanting “JUMP! You can do it!” Un fortunately, those words of encouragement were muted by the sound of my own internal voice with its own mantras of “What the hell are you doing up here? This is really going to hurt. This is stupid; I CAN’T DO THIS!” Next the thing I knew I was gasping f or air after just struggling back to the surface in shear agony. That was one time in my life that I wish that I would have made a liar out of myself, but unfortunately, I got exactly what I expected, what I planned for, and what I spent a 110% of energy focusing on. There was another lesson to be learned there, which I did learn in the years to come. I can and will get what I focus on. That led me to really begin paying attention to what I focus on. What does it mean to “watch your T.V.?” The term T.V. or T ransformational Vocabulary, is one I borrowed from Tony Robbins. The words we use are so powerful , and they influence how we live our lives. Research shows that our choice of words can manifest into our realities.

Now consider what kinds of effects you could have on your body if you now began to use words promote health and healing. “My heart is beating with joy,” is just one of a few examples of the idiomatic expressions one may begin to use. Unfortunately, there are not enough of these types of positive expressions in the English language yet. You may notice a great deal of difference just by carefully choosing the specific word you use to convey a similar meaning. Consider the following lists of words: Rage Angry Upset Annoyed Peeved Depressed Down Sad Blue Occupied Exhausted Worn out Pooped Tired Fatigued Also consider the positive words you use: Happy Elated Enthused Excited Ecstatic Good Great Fantastic Incredible Phenomenal Okay Acceptable Outstanding Extraordinary Exceptional "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"© 2002.

Why not begin to use the words that make us feel ecstatic, more phenomenal, so that we can live exceptional lives. The vocabulary we use with ourselves as with others can transform our lives as it did that sunny day for me. Fortunately, I got a chance to return to that ledge with new insight. This time I was by myself, therefore chanted out loud, “I CAN DO IT!” And so can you!"}]
