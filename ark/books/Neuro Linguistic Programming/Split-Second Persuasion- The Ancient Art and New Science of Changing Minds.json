The gentleman in question slips the preciousartefact inside his dinner jacket, then quietly makes for the door.What is Churchill to do?Caught between loyalty to his host and an equal and opposite desire to avoid anundignified contretemps, he suddenly has an idea. With no time to lose, hequickly picks up the matching silver pepper-pot and slips it inside his ownjacket pocket. Then, approaching his ‘partner in crime’, he reluctantly producesthe condimentary contraband and sets it down in front of him.‘I think they’ve seen us,’ he whispers. ‘We’d better put them back …’Air Hostess: Please fasten your seatbelt before take-off.Muhammad Ali: I’m Superman. Superman don’t need no seatbelt!Air Hostess: Superman don’t need no aeroplane!WILD HORSESIt’s six o’clock on a dead December evening in North London. Two men standdrinking in a bar in Camden Town. They finish their pints, set them back down onthe counter, and look at one other. Same again? Sure, why not? Though they donot know it yet, these two men are about to be late for a dinner engagement. Inan Indian restaurant far across town, another man sits waiting for them. Somecasual, low-grade Parkinson’s loosens the wires in his flickering right hand,and he’s tired. He is wearing a brightly coloured new tie which he has boughtspecially for the occasion, and which took him half an hour to do up. It hasteddy bears on it.It is Sunday. The man in the restaurant watches the rain gust darkly against thelow-lit windows. Today is his son’s birthday. In the bar in Camden Town theother men watch, too, as the rain strobes amber in the desolate glow of thestreet lamps, and glazes the liquid pavements with a slick of neon gold. Time tohead off, they say. To the train. To the restaurant. To the man who is sittingthere waiting. And so they leave.They arrive late, by almost three-quarters of an hour. Somehow, they find thisamusing. They have misjudged, in hindsight by quite some considerable margin,the length of time required to consume four pints of beer and then negotiate theouter reaches of the Piccadilly and Northern lines. Instead of setting aside acouple of hours for the venture, they have allowed something in the region often minutes. To make matters worse, they are drunk. On their arrival at therestaurant, things do not go well.‘Late again?’ the man who has been waiting for them enquires sarcastically.‘You’ll never learn, will you?’The response is as vehement as it is instant – a million age-old grievances allrolled into a single defining moment. One of the newcomers, the smaller of thetwo by quite some way, turns around and walks straight back out of therestaurant. It’s the son. But not before he has uttered a few well-chosen wordsof his own.And so there he is, the little man. A couple of minutes earlier, rattling down atube line heading west, he had been looking forward to a simple birthday dinnerwith his father and his best friend. Now he is alone under derelict Decemberskies, hurtling along the pavement in the direction of the tube station.Freezing cold and soaking wet because he’s forgotten to pick up his coat. Funnyhow quickly things can change.When the little man arrives at the station, he is seething. He stands for a fewmoments at the ticket barrier trying to locate his pass, and thinks to himselfthat wild horses wouldn’t be able to drag him back to that restaurant. Thestation concourse is flooded and there is no one around. But then he hearssomething coming from the street: the sound of approaching footsteps. Suddenly,out of nowhere, there’s the big man. Having legged it from the restaurant to thestation, he slumps against a pillar by the entrance. The little man moves away.‘Wait!’ says the big man, when he’s finally got his breath back.The little man isn’t interested.‘Don’t even think about it,’ he says, raising his hand an inch, maybe two inchesabove his head. ‘I’ve had it up to here with his snide remarks!’‘But wait!’ says the big man again.The little man is getting angrier by the second.‘Look,’ he says, ‘you’re wasting your time. Just go back to him. Go back to therestaurant. Go wherever you like. Just get out of my face!’The big man is worried that the little man is going to hit him.‘OK,’ he says. ‘OK. But before I go, will you just let me say one thing?’Silence. The rain turns crimson as some traffic-lights change at the crossing bythe station entrance.Just to get rid of him, the little man relents.‘Go on then,’ he says. ‘What is it?’There’s a moment of truth as the two of them look at each other – the big manand the little man – across the barrier. The little man notices that a couple ofbuttons have fallen off the big man’s overcoat, and that his woollen bobble-hatis lying on the ground in a puddle some distance away. Must’ve been quite adash, the little man thinks to himself. From the restaurant to the station. Andthen he remembers something. Something the big man had told him once. About howhis mother had knitted him that hat, one Christmas.The big man holds out his arms – a gesture of helplessness, openness, perhapsboth.And then he says it.‘When was the last time you ever saw me run?’The little man opens his mouth, but finds himself treading words. Suddenly, he’sin trouble. The problem is that the big man weighs close to 28 stone. Thoughthey’ve been friends for quite some time, the little man has never seen the bigman run. Which is actually kind of funny. In fact, by his own admission, the bigman has trouble walking.The more the little man thinks about it, the more he finds himself strugglingfor an answer. And the more he struggles, the more he feels his anger ebb away.Eventually, he says: ‘Well, never.’There’s a period of silence. Then the big man puts out a hand.‘Come on then,’ he says. ‘Let’s go back.’And so they do.When they get back to the restaurant, the little man and his father both saysorry to each other and the three wiser, if not entirely wise, men sit down tohave dinner together. For the second time. Nobody’s talking miracles, but theysure as hell are thinking it. The big man had lost some buttons. And the woollenhat that his mother had made him would never be the same again. But somehow,somewhere, in the wind and the rain and the cold, he had traded them forsomething better.There was nothing, the little man thinks to himself, that anyone could have saidto him in that tube station that would have made him go back to the restaurant.Wild horses could not have dragged him. Yet the big man had done exactly thatwith just ten simple words. Words that had come from a kingdom south ofconsciousness:‘When was the last time you ever saw me run?’Somehow, in the depths of that London winter, the big man had drummed up somesunshine.HONESTY’S THE BEST POLICYHere’s a question for you. How many times a day do you think someone tries topersuade you? What to do. What to buy. Where to go. How to get there. And I’mtalking from the moment you wake up in the morning to the moment your head hitsthe pillow again in the evening. Twenty? Thirty? That’s what most people saywhen asked this question – so try not to feel too bad about what’s coming next.In actual fact – get ready – estimates tend to hover around the 400 mark! Comesas a bit of a shock at first, doesn’t it? But let’s think about it for a minute.Go through the options. What molecules of influence can infiltrate the pathwaysof our brain?Well, for a start there’s the advertising industry. TV. Radio. Billboards. Web.How many times a day do you think you see an ad? Right – quite a few. Thenthere’s all the other stuff we see. The man selling hotdogs on the streetcorner. The policeman directing traffic. The religious guy with the sandwichboard in the middle of that traffic. And then, of course, there’s the little guyin our heads who’s almost always banging on about something. OK, we might notactually see him but we certainly hear him often enough. Starts to mount up whenyou think about it, doesn’t it? And believe me – we haven’t even started yet.When it comes down to it, we take all this for granted, don’t we? Which is why,when asked how many times a day people try to get us to do stuff, we say 20 or30 instead of 400. But there’s an even more fundamental question here, onethat’s seldom even considered.Where does such persuasion come from – I mean, originally? A lot is writtenabout the origins of mind, but what about the origins of changing minds?Let’s imagine an alternative society to the one just described – a society inwhich coercion, not persuasion, is the primary tool of influence. Just thinkwhat it would be like if every time we decided not to buy a hotdog, the vendoron the street corner came charging after us with a baseball bat. Or if, when weshot past the speed gun at 80 m.p.h., some death-dealing sensor riddled ourwindscreen with bullets. Or if when we didn’t sign up with the ‘right’ politicalparty, or the ‘right’ religion – have the ‘right’ colour skin even – we sufferedthe consequences later.Some of these scenarios are, I would guess, easier to imagine than others. Butthe point I’m making here is simple. It’s largely because of persuasion that wehave a ‘society’ at all. There have been various attempts at various times tochallenge such a notion. But each, at some stage, has fallen decidedly short.Persuasion is what keeps us alive. Often, quite literally.Take the following instance. In the autumn of 2003, I fly to San Francisco for aconference. Pressed for time before leaving Cambridge, I decide, because I aminsane, against the time-honoured wisdom of booking a hotel in advance, and optinstead to seek one out when I get there: a cheap, if somewhat frenetic,establishment in a neighbourhood so dangerous that even the serial killers goround in pairs.Every morning on leaving my brothel – I mean, hotel – and every evening upon myreturn, I run into the same bunch of guys huddled around the newspaper standoutside: a Vietnam veteran with six months to live, a Brazilian hooker more downon her luck than anything more lucrative, and a flotilla of hungry and homelesswho between them have taken more hits than a Paris Hilton slumber party on YouTube. All have had their fair share of misfortune. All their misadventures. Andall stand despondently on the pavement, their windswept placards and rain-soddensignboards stacked up dejectedly beside them.Now I’m not saying that these guys didn’t need the money. They did. But after aweek of small talk and slowly getting acquainted, it had reached the point whereour fortunes had all but reversed – and I was asking them for cash. Most of theposse I was on first-name terms with, and after shelling out generously for thefirst couple of days any desire to swell their coffers further had disappearedfaster than a Bernie Madoff hedge fund.Or so I thought.Then one night, towards the end of my stay, I notice a guy I haven’t seenbefore. By this stage I’m building up a bit of immunity to the hard luckstories, and as I pass I give no more than a fleeting glance at the dog-earedpiece of cardboard he’s holding out in front of him. Yet no sooner does themessage catch my eye than I’m poking around inside my coat pocket, looking forsomething to give him. And not loose change but something more substantial. Amere five words has got me reaching for my wallet without a moment’s hesitation:WHY LIE? I WANT BEER!I felt I’d been legally mugged.Back in the safety – well, comparative safety – of my hotel room I sit therethinking about that slogan. Even Jesus would have applauded. I wasn’t usually inthe habit of doling out money to pissheads. Especially when, just a few feetaway, more deserving causes beckoned. Yet that was precisely what I’d done. Whatwas it about those five words that had had such an effect on me? I wondered. Theguy couldn’t have got the money out of me any faster had he pulled a gun fromhis jacket. What was it that had so cleanly, so comprehensively, yet so covertlydisabled all those cognitive security systems I’d been so painstakingly intenton installing since my arrival?I smile.Suddenly, I’m reminded of a similar occasion many years before when I’d arguedwith my father in a restaurant. And then stormed off. There was no way, I’dthought to myself at the time, that I would be going back to that restaurantthat night. Wild horses could not have dragged me. Yet a mere 30 seconds and tenwords later a friend of mine had dramatically changed my mind.There was, I began to realise, something inherent in both these incidents thatwas timeless, weightless, and fundamentally different from normal modes ofcommunication. They had a transforming, transcendental, almost other-worldlyquality about them.But what exactly was it?A SUPERSTRAIN OF PERSUASIONAs a psychologist, up there in my hotel room, I felt I should have an answer tothat question. But the more I thought about it, the more I struggled to come upwith one. This was a question about persuasion. About attitude change. Aboutsocial influence. Regular banter in the social psychology locker-room – and yet,it now seemed, there was a big black hole in the literature. I was baffled. Howcould a total stranger clean out my wallet with just five simple words? And how,with just ten, could my best friend clean out my brain?Usually, it works like this. If, like my friend, we want to calm someone down,or like the beggar extract money from them, we tend to take our time over it. Wecarefully set up our pitch. And with good reason. Minds – just ask any used carsalesman – don’t change easily. Nine times out of ten, persuasion is contingenton a complex combination of factors, relating not just to what we say but alsohow we say it. Not to mention, once said, how it’s interpreted. In the vastmajority of cases, influence is wrought by talking. By a nervy cocktail ofcompromise, enterprise, and negotiation. By wrapping up whatever it is that wewant in an intricate parcel of words. But with my friend and the homeless guy itwas different. With them, it wasn’t so much the wrapping that did the trick as –well – the lack of it. It was the immaculate incisiveness of the influence; theraw and chastening elegance; the deft, swift touch of psychological genius that,more than anything else, gave it its power.Or was it?No sooner had I extricated myself from San Francisco and returned to the equallychaotic, if somewhat less predictable, milieu of Cambridge academic life than itbegan to dawn on me just how wide-ranging a question this was. Did there exist,high above the snowline of persuasion, an elixir of influence – a secret art of‘split-second persuasion’ – that each of us could learn? To close that deal. Toget that guy. To tip those scales just that little bit more in our favour.Much of what we now know about the brain – the relationship between function andstructure – has come about not from the study of the conventional but of theextraordinary. From extremes of behaviour at odds with the everyday. Might thesame also be true of persuasion? Take the Sirens in Homer’s Iliad: beautifulmaidens whose song is so bewitching that mariners, even on pain of death, areirresistibly drawn to it. Or Cupid and his arrows. Or the ‘secret chord thatpleased the Lord’ that David plays in the Leonard Cohen song ‘Hallelujah’.Outside the realms of mythology, might such a chord actually exist?As my research progressed the answer to this question soon became clear. Slowlybut surely, as the list of examples grew longer and the cold, digital voodoo ofthe statistics began to unfold, I started to piece together the elements of abrand new kind of influence. To plot the genome of a mysterious, previouslyunidentified, superstrain of persuasion. Most of us have some idea of how topersuade. But it’s largely trial and error. We get it wrong as many times as weget it right. Yet some people, it began to emerge, really could get it right.With absolute precision. And not just around the coffee table. Or out on thetown with friends. But in knife-edge confrontations where both stakes andemotions ran high. So who were these black belts of influence? And what madethem tick? More importantly – what, if anything, could they teach the rest ofus?Here’s another example. Imagine it had been you on the plane. What do you thinkyou would have said at the time?I’m on a flight (business class, thanks to a film company) to New York. The guyacross the aisle from me has a problem with his food. After several minutes ofprodding it around his plate, he summons the chief steward.‘This food,’ he enunciates, ‘sucks.’The chief steward nods and is very understanding. ‘Oh my God!’ he schmoozes.‘It’s such a pity … You’ll never fly with us again? How will we ever get thechance to make it up to you?’You get the picture.But then comes something that totally changes the game. That doesn’t just turnthe tables, it kicks them over.‘Look,’ continues the man (who was, one suspected, quite used to continuing), ‘Iknow it’s not your fault. But it just isn’t good enough. And you know what? I’mso fed up with people being nice!’‘IS THAT RIGHT, YOU FUCKING DICK? THEN WHY THE FUCK DON’T YOU FUCKING SHUT UP,YOU ARSEHOLE?’Instantly, the whole cabin falls silent (at which point, in an amusingcoincidence, the ‘Fasten Seat Belt’ sign also comes on). Who the hell was that?A guy in one of the front seats (a famous musician) turns round. He looks at theguy who’s complaining, then winks at him.‘Is that any better?’ he enquires. ’‘Cos if it ain’t, I can keep going …’For a moment, nobody says anything. Everyone freezes. But then, as if somesecret neural tripwire had suddenly just been pulled, our disgruntleddiner … smiles. And then he laughs. And then he really laughs. This, in turn,sets the chief steward off. And that, of course, gets us all started.Problem solved with just a few simple words. And definitive proof, if ever anywere needed, of what my old English teacher Mr Johnson used to say: ‘You can beas rude as you like so long as you’re polite about it.’But back to my original question. How do you think you would have reacted undersuch circumstances? How would you have got on? Me? Not too well, as it turnedout. But the more I thought about it, the more I came to realise precisely whatit was about situations like these that made them so special. It wasn’t just thepsychological bullseyes – spectacular though some of them might be. No, it wasmore than that. It was the individuals who scored them.I mean, think about it. Forget about the musician for a moment. In the absenceof screwballs like him, air stewards (not to mention, in more hostile scenarios,policemen, members of the armed forces, professional negotiators, health-careworkers and Samaritans) face such dilemmas as these every day of their lives.These are people who are trained in the art of persuasion; who usetried-and-tested techniques to maintain the status quo. Such techniques involvebuilding a relationship with the other person and engaging them in dialoguewhile at the same time projecting a calm, patient and empathic interpersonalstyle. Techniques, in other words, that are underpinned by social process.But there are, quite clearly, some of us who are simply ‘naturals’. Who do notneed to train. Who are, in fact, so good, so extraordinarily different, thatthey have a gift for turning people around. Not through negotiation. Ordialogue. Or the rules of give-and-take. But with just a few simple words.Sound crazy? I know. Back when the idea first came to me, I thought the same.But not for long. Soon I began to unearth a tantalising body of evidence –circumstantial, anecdotal, allusive – which suggested the possibility that thatthere really might be black belts in our midst. And, what’s more, they might notall be good guys.CRACKING THE CODE OF PERSUASIONThis, then, is a book about persuasion. But it’s a book about a special kind ofpersuasion – split-second persuasion – with an incubation period of seconds andan evolutionary history just a little bit longer. Incongruity (or surprise) isobviously a key component. But that’s just the beginning. Whether we take what’son offer or leave it on the table depends on four additional factors:simplicity; perceived self-interest;1 confidence; and empathy – factors asintegral to persuasion in the plant and animal kingdoms as they are to the scamsof some of the world’s most brilliant con artists. Together, this five-partcocktail of influence – SPICE – is lethal. And all the more so when takenstraight: undiluted by rhetoric, uncontaminated by argument.Winston Churchill certainly knew as much. And as for the air hostess who oncetook on The Greatest – I doubt Muhammad Ali ever took a cleaner shot in hislife.It’s a kind of persuasion that can get you whatever you want. Reservations.Contracts. Bargains. Babies. Anything. In the right hands. But which in thewrong hands can prove disastrous. As brutal and deadly as any weapon that’s outthere.The journey begins with a simple idea: that some of us are better at the art ofpersuasion than others. And that with persuasion, just as with everything else,there exists a spectrum of talent along which each of us has our place. At oneend are those who always ‘put their foot in it’. Who seem not only to get thewrong end of the stick, but sometimes the wrong stick even. At the other we havethe flipnotists. Those who exhibit an uncanny, almost preternatural, propensityfor ‘getting it right’.In the pages that follow, we plot the co-ordinates of this mysterious strain ofpersuasion. Slowly but surely, as we cast the net of empirical enquiry fartherand farther afield, beyond the familiar reefs of social influence to the deeper,less-charted waters of neonatal development, cognitive neuroscience, mathematicsand psychopathology, we navigate theories about the chimeric art of persuasionthat slowly begin to converge. That gradually distil into a single, definitiveformula. Our journey uncovers a treasure-trove of questions: * What do newborn babies and psychopaths have in common? * Has our ability to change minds, like the mind itself, evolved? * What secrets do the all-time greats of persuasion and the grandmasters of martial arts have in common? * Is there a ‘persuasion pathway’ in the brain?The answers will amaze you. And will definitely, next time you go for thatupgrade, help you get it.1 This refers to the self-interest of the target. Persuasion, of course, is notalways in the target’s actual interest. But if the target perceives it to be so,then the attempt is far more effective."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1THE PERSUASION INSTINCTJudge: I find you guilty as charged and hereby sentence you to 72 hours’community service and a fine of £150.

But if you allowme a few moments with the jury, I’d prefer to pay now.A policeman on traffic duty pulls a motorist over for speeding.‘Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t give you a ticket,’ he says.‘Well,’ says the driver, ‘last week my wife ran off with one of you guys. Andwhen I saw your car, I thought you were bringing her back.’A SPEW-RIOUS TALE?1In 1938, in Selma, southern Georgia, a physician by the name of Drayton Dohertywas summoned to the bedside of a man called Vance Vanders. Six months earlier,in a graveyard in the dead of night, Vanders had bumped into a witch-doctor andthe spook had put a curse on him. A week or so later Vanders got a pain in hisstomach, and decided to take to his bed. Much to the distress of his family,he’d remained there ever since.Doherty gave Vanders a thorough examination, and grimly shook his head. It’s amystery, he said, and shut the door behind him. But the next day he was back.‘I tracked down the witch-doctor and lured him back to the graveyard,’ heannounced. ‘When he arrived I jumped on him, pinned him to the ground, and sworethat if he didn’t tell me the exact nature of the curse he’d put on you, andgive me the antidote, I would kill him on the spot.’Vanders’ eyes widened.‘What did he do?’ he asked.‘Eventually, after quite a struggle, he relented,’ Doherty continued. ‘And Imust confess that, in all my years in medicine, I’ve never heard anything likeit. What he did was this. He implanted a lizard egg inside your stomach – andthen caused it to hatch. And the pain you’ve been feeling for the last sixmonths is the lizard – it’s been eating you alive!’Vanders’ eyes almost popped out of his head.‘Is there anything you can do for me, Doctor?’ he pleaded.Doherty smiled reassuringly.‘Luckily for you,’ he said, ‘the body is remarkably resilient and most of thedamage has been largely superficial. So we’ll administer the antidote thewitch-doctor kindly gave us, and wait and see what happens.’Vanders nodded enthusiastically.Ten minutes later, his patient vomiting uncontrollably from the powerful emetiche’d given him, Doherty opened his bag. Inside was a lizard he’d bought from thelocal pet shop.‘Aha!’ he announced with a flourish, brandishing it by the tail. ‘Here’s theculprit!’Vanders looked up, then retched violently again. Doherty collected his things.‘Not to worry,’ he said. ‘You’re over the worst of it and will soon pick upafter this.’Then he left.Sure enough, for the first time in ages, Vanders slept soundly that night. Andwhen he awoke in the morning he had eggs and grits for breakfast.Persuasion. No sooner is the word out than images of second-hand car dealers,mealy-mouthed politicians, schmoozers, cruisers and a barrel-load of life’sother users and abusers come padding – brothel-creepers and smoking-jackets atthe ready – across the dubious neuronal shag-piles of our minds. It’s that kindof word. Though undoubtedly one of social psychology’s hippest, mostsought-after neighbourhoods, persuasion also has a dodgy, downbeat reputation:an area of Portakabins and bars, sleazy garage forecourts and teeming neonstrips.Which, of course, is where you often find it at work.But there’s more to persuasion than just cheap talk and loud suits. Or, for thatmatter, loud talk and cheap suits. A witch-doctor and physician go head to head(quite literally) over the health of a local man. The witch-doctor deals whatappears to be a knock-out blow. His opponent rides it and effortlessly turns thetables. This extraordinary tale of a shaman and a flipnotist encapsulatesinfluence in its simplest, purest form: a battle for neural supremacy. Yet wheredoes persuasion come from? Why does it work? Why is it possible that what is inmy mind, when converted into words, is able to change what’s in yours?The Ancient Greeks, who seemed to have a god for more or less everything, hadone, inevitably, for persuasion. Peitho (in Roman mythology, Suadela) was acompanion of Aphrodite and is often depicted in Graeco-Roman culture with a ballof silver twine. These days, of course, with Darwin, game theory, and advancesin neuroimaging, we see things a little differently. And with the gods upagainst it and the Greeks more interested in basketball, we tend to lookelsewhere for affirmation. To science, for instance. Or Oprah.In this chapter we turn our attention towards evolutionary biology – anddiscover that persuasion has a longer family history than either we, or thegods, might have realised. We go in search of the earliest forms of persuasion –prelinguistic, pre-conscious, pre-human – and arrive at a startling conclusion.Not only is persuasion endemic to earthly existence, it’s also systemic, too; asmuch a part of the rhythm of the natural order as the emergence of life itself.PURRSUASIONNote to architects who are currently in the process of designing modern, shiny,glassy buildings for affluent, leafy, tree-lined neighbourhoods: spare a thoughtfor the local bird population.In 2005, the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge was havingtrouble with kamikaze pigeons. The courtyard of a brand new extension block wasproving a blackspot for avian suicides, with as many as ten birds a daydive-bombing the window of the state-of-the-art lecture theatre. It didn’t takelong to fathom out the reason. Reflected in the glass were the surrounding treesand bushes. And the birds – like some architects I could mention – couldn’t tellthe difference between appearance and reality. What to do?In contrast to the diagnosis, the remedy proved elusive. Curtains, pictures –even a scarecrow – all came to nothing. Then one day, Bundy Mackintosh, one ofthe researchers who worked in the building, had an idea. Why not talk to thebirds in their own language?So she did.Mackintosh cut, out of a sheet of coloured cardboard, the profile of an eagleand then stuck it in the window. Deep in their brains, she reasoned, the birdswould have a console; a sort of primitive mental dashboard on which, silhouettedas birds of prey, would appear a series of hazard warning lights. As soon as oneof these predators came into view, the corresponding light would immediatelyflash up red – and an ancient evolutionary force-field would suddenly engulf theunit, repelling the birds and diverting them from the danger.Problem solved.Talking to animals in their own native tongue (as Bundy Mackintosh did in a verysimple way with her cardboard and scissors) involves empathy. And learning thesyntax of biological vernacular. And if you think it’s just humans who can doit, think again. Biologist Karen McComb of the University of Sussex hasdiscovered something interesting about cats: they employ a special ‘solicitationpurr’ which hotwires their owners to fill up their food bowls at dinnertime.1 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn1]Mccomb and her co-workerscompared cat-owners’ responses to different kinds of purr – and found that purrsrecorded when cats were seeking food were more aversive and harder to ignorethan other purrs played at the same volume. The difference is one of pitch. Whencats are soliciting food, they give off a classic ‘mixed message’ – embedding anurgent, high-pitched cry within a contented, low-pitched purr. This, accordingto McComb, not only safeguards against instant ejection from the bedroom (highpitch on its own) but also taps into ancient, mammalian nurturing instincts forvulnerable, dependent offspring (more on that later).‘The embedding of a cry within a call that we normally associate withcontentment is quite a subtle means of eliciting a response,’ explains McComb,‘and solicitation purring is probably more acceptable to humans than overtmeowing.’Or, to put it another way, cats, without the linguistic baggage of 40,000 words(the estimated vocabulary of the average English-speaking adult), have learned afaster, leaner, more efficient means of persuading us to do their bidding –exactly the same strategy that Bundy Mackintosh hit upon to ‘talk’ to thepigeons of Cambridge. The deployment of what is known in ethology as the keystimulus.MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAYA key stimulus is influence in its purest form. It is neat, 100-per-cent-proofmind control – undiluted by language and the thought fields of consciousness –which is knocked back straight, down the hatch, like a shot. Key stimuli aresimple, unambiguous, and easily understood – persuasion as originally intended.Officially, of course, the definition is somewhat different: a key stimulus isan environmental trigger that initiates, solely by its presence, something knownas a fixed action pattern – a unit of innate behaviour that continues, onceinitiated, uninterrupted to completion. But it amounts, more or less, to roughlythe same thing.Numerous incidences of key stimuli are found within the natural world, not leastwhen it comes to mating. Some are visual, like Bundy Mackintosh’s eaglesilhouette. Some acoustic, like the solicitation purr. And some kinetic, likethe way honeybees dance to communicate the location of a food source. Somecombine all three. Chiroxiphia pareola is renowned for its cobalt coat, itssweet and melodious warble, and its elaborate courtship ritual (which, uniquely,involves a dominant male supported by a five-strong backing band). No,Chiroxiphia pareola is not the Latin for Barry White but a tropical songbirdfound deep in the Amazon jungle. It has a brain the size of a pea.Chiroxiphia pareola is no member of the Seduction Community.2 Yet there’snothing you can tell it about pulling. When the male of the species encounters asuitable mate he doesn’t, all of a sudden, start beating around his bush. Quitethe opposite, in fact. He dances straight out of it. And scores.2 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn2]In certain species of frog it issound, primarily, that makes up the language of love. The Green Treefrog is oneof Louisiana’s most instantly recognisable critters – especially if you’re tiredand trying to catch forty winks. More commonly known as the Bell Frog (becauseof the distinctive sound of its mating call which resembles a ringing bell:quonk, quonk, quonk), it’s equally at home in a variety of differentenvironments such as ponds, roadside ditches, rivers and swamps. Not to mentionwell-lit verandahs where it feeds, amongst other things, on sleep deprivation.The acoustical arsenal of the Bell Frog is actually more complicated than itappears. When calling in unison, for instance, individuals frequentlyco-ordinate their efforts – and the resulting cacophony will often emerge as aharmonious (though exasperating!) ‘quonk-quack, quonk-quack’ refrain. Researchhas also shown that males tend to vary their calls depending on thecircumstances. At dusk, for example, as a precursor to hitting the breedingpool, they will issue a preliminary ‘territorial’ call (one that tells othermales to back off), and then, while en route to the pool, resort to a rathermore prickly-sounding chunter as they gruffly, and somewhat slothfully, bumpinto each other. It’s only on reaching the breeding pool that they really openup – cranking up the chorus to its anthemic ‘quonk quonk’ finale. So resonant,in fact, is this eponymous mating call that female Bell Frogs can actually makeit out from up to 300 metres away. A statistic, oddly enough, not lost on localresidents.CROAK AND DAGGERUp until now, the influence that we’ve been looking at in birds and frogs hasbeen the kind of honest, straight-down-the-line persuasion we see repeated amillion times over in human society – the only difference being that these guysdo it better. From finding a partner to nailing that crucial deal, successdepends on speaking a common language. And they don’t come any more common thanthe key stimulus.But the importance of this common language in persuasion – this mutualunderstanding, or empathy3– is brought into even sharper focus when we consider a completely differentkind of influence, mimicry: when a member of one species assumes or manipulatesthe characteristics of another (though this can also occur intra-species) forthe purposes of personal advancement.Let’s stay with Bell Frogs for the moment. For most frogs, the dating game isset in stone. I mean, face it – when all you can do is croak, there isn’t muchroom for manoeuvre. What tends to happen is this. The males just sit there andcroak … and the females, if they get lucky, come hopping. It couldn’t be anysimpler. But Bell Frogs have figured something out. These little buggers haveincorporated an element of skulduggery into the proceedings, and it’s by nomeans unusual for a deeply resonant baritone in full quonk to be stalked,completely unawares, by a silent, shadowy cadre of male hangers-on.This bears testament to the steely ingenuity of natural selection. Think aboutit. A hard night’s quonking uses up vital energy stores. And because of this,one of two things can happen. On the one hand, the caller might draw a blank,and – exhausted – hail a taxi. On the other, he might get lucky and finish updown by the breeding pool. On whichever note the evening finally ends doesn’treally matter. Observe, in either case, what happens to the original callingsite once its former occupant slopes off. Suddenly it goes on the market. Andturns, in the process, into prime location real estate for any one of thenon-quonking identity thieves to clean up in. Any unsuspecting female who showsup after the quonker has left discovers – as if nothing has changed – anon-quonking impostor in his place. But how is she to tell the difference?Bottom line is: she can’t.4SELF BE-LEAF3 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn3]As a weapon of persuasion mimicryis ingenious. If the key stimulus is influence taken straight, then mimicry, youcould say, is empathy taken straight. Just like the key stimulus, there areseveral different kinds – not all of which, as we’ve just seen with the BellFrogs, are benign.For a start, there’s the most obvious form – visual mimicry – which is sort ofwhat the non-quonking love rats get up to down in Louisiana. But depending onthe scale of the biological forgery, and how sophisticated it is, there are alsomore subtle varieties that incorporate, alongside visual cues, both auditory andolfactory ones.A good example of this hybrid mimicry is found in plants (when I said thatpersuasion was integral to the natural order, I meant all of it). 4[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn4]The discomycete fungus moniliniavaccinii-corymbosi is a plant pathogen that infects the leaves of blueberries,causing them to secrete sweet, sugary substances such as glucose and fructose.When this happens something rather interesting occurs. With the leaves, ineffect, now producing nectar – thus fraudulently impersonating flowers – theybegin, like flowers, to attract pollinators, even though they actually looknothing like flowers and still, in every other respect apart from smell,resemble leaves. Natural selection then takes care of the rest. A bee drops bybelieving the sugar to be nectar. It slurps some up (during which time thefungus attaches itself to its abdomen) then subsequently moves on to theblueberry flower proper where it transfers the fungus to the ovaries. There, onthe ovaries, the fungus reproduces – spawning mummified, inedible berries, whichhibernate over the winter before going on to infect a fresh crop of plants inthe spring. Clever, huh?But the hustle doesn’t end there. There is, it turns out, a whole other level tothis seedy little love triangle. The olfactory emissions from the surface of theblueberry plant’s leaves aren’t the only ones. The infected leaves, uponanalysis, also reflect ultraviolet (which, under normal circumstances, theyabsorb) – but which the flowers emit as a low-level come-on to insects.Suddenly, it turns out, the leaves have snitched not just one aspect of theblueberry flower’s identity but two, visual and olfactory. Now that, for acommon or garden fungus, really is clever.WEB OF DECEITAs an example of natural mimicry the discomycete fungus’s antics are actuallysomewhat unusual. Ordinarily, rather than implicating a third party in the scam– in this case, leaves – the mimic does its own dirty work. Pygmy Owls, forinstance, have ‘false eyes’ on the reverse side of their heads, to foolpredators into thinking they can, quite literally, see out of the back of them.5 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn5]Conversely, Owl Butterflies haveeyespots on the underside of their wings so that, on suddenly flipping over,they resemble the face of an owl (see Figure 1.1, overleaf). HairstreakButterflies go one better and, like a number of species of insect, possessfilamentous ‘tails’ at the ends of their wings. These tails, when combined withother elements of wing patination, create the distinct impression of a falsehead – which bamboozles predators and misdirects attack. Two heads, as they say,are often better than one.Less benign uses of distraction are glimpsed in the world of arachnids. 6[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn6]The Golden Orb Weaver (a spiderquite common in the New World) gets its colourful appellation from its dazzlinggolden web, which it spins (not, at first sight, the most brilliant idea in theworld for rustling up dinner if you’re a spider) in conspicuous, brightly litareas. But there’s method in the Golden Weaver’s madness. Research reveals thatbees, contrary to common sense, find it easier to stay clear of the web whenthey should actually find it more difficult: when the light is poor, when thefilaments are harder to see, and when the yellow pigmentation is indistinct.Why? Well, think about it. When it comes to nectar-producing flowers, which doyou suppose is the most common presenting shade?[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_001_r1.jpg]Figure 1.1 — The distinctive, and intricately crafted, eyespots on the wings ofan Owl Butterfly. (photo credit 1.1)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c01-fig1a]Support for such a theory comes from experiments that have ingeniously variedthe colour of spiders’ webs. While the bees have little trouble in associatingother pigments with danger – red, blue and green, for example – and subsequentlylearning to avoid them, it’s yellow, time and again, that poses them thegreatest difficulty.Similar zoological scams are also found in the insect world. The ‘honeytrap’ maywell have been the stock in trade of some of Hollywood’s best-known secretagents over the years, but ever wondered who thought of it first? You need lookno further than the firefly. 7[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn7]Studies have shown that femalefireflies of the genus Photuris emit precisely the same light signals as femalesof the Photinus genus issue for mating calls. But that’s not all. Research hasalso revealed something else. Male Photinus fireflies attempting to make outwith these masquarading femmes fatales get quite a lot more than they bargainfor. They get eaten. I had a date like that once.IT ALL ADS UPSo far in this chapter we’ve been looking at how animals – and plants – ‘do’persuasion. How, in the absence of language, interests are served and influenceis wielded. And it is, without a doubt, influence – exactly the same kind ofinfluence that we see at work in humans. Only faster, less messy, moreconcentrated. How else would you describe it? Contrary to outward appearance,the Golden Orb Weaver spider doesn’t have a diploma in fine art; nor does itattend night classes in interior design. And yet its web is yellow. Why? For onereason, and one reason only. To manipulate bees into doing something silly. Intodoing something that they otherwise, as bees, wouldn’t dream of doing. Droppingin for a visit.It’s the same with our discomycete fungus. This unscrupulous, psychopathicfungus with its dodgy botanical morals knows only too well that bees and otherpollinating insects will not, in the normal run of things, touch it with abargepole. So what does it do? It does what any other unconscionable, upwardlymobile social predator would do: enlists the help of an innocent third party andruthlessly exploits it as a go-between. Just because there’s no languageinvolved doesn’t mean to say that there’s no persuasion involved – as Idiscovered pretty soon after I got married. One simple glance speaks volumes,right?The dividing line between animal and human persuasion gets even more blurredwhen we consider just how much of the human variety is, like its animalisticcounterpart, instinctive. The secret of good advertising often lies not in itsappeal to our rational, cognitive faculties, but in its ability to get straightthrough to the emotion centres of our brains: primal, ancient structures that wenot only share with but actually inherit from animals.I remember when I was a child local town-planners, reporters and crash-sceneinvestigators being completely bamboozled by a sudden spate of accidents thathad, seemingly overnight, begun to occur at a busy, though previouslyunremarkable, road junction. A week or so later, the local paper ran a story onits front cover. It featured a bunch of blokes from the council removing atwenty-foot billboard of a curvy, scantily clad blonde from a prominent positionnearby.Sex sells, always has. Even the word ‘sex’ sells. 8[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn8]In fact, research conducted in 2001revealed that sex appeared on 45 per cent of all Cosmopolitan and Glamour frontcovers. That simple combination of letters – SEX – acts as a powerful,eyecatching, interest-grabbing, money-spinning, key stimulus.Take, for instance, this clever little flier for an estate agent that camethrough my front door not so long ago:[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_002_r1.jpg]Figure 1.2 – Into cross-dressing? Then buy a house from us.Cheeky, huh?Of course, marketing supremos and other captains of industry are constantlybombarding us with sneaky, sub-radar key stimuli. In the relentless campaign forthat most lucrative copy space of all – the one between our ears – thedeployment of the key stimulus is the psychological equivalent of using a nerveagent. Take the picture of Marilyn Monroe below.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_003_r1.jpg]Figure 1.3 – Nice guitar. (photo credit 1.3)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c01-fig3a]Notice anything strange about it? What about the waist? Does it appear, perhaps,a bit too ‘hourglassy’? Images like this, in which the model – either throughsheer biological good fortune, über-zealous corsetry, or the odd dab of airbrushhere and there – exhibits inordinately evocative features, are found all overthe place in society (at which point I should explain that this diabolical stateof affairs is as distressing to us guys as it is to you girls). And why? Becausethey sell. But a more pertinent question than ‘why’ is ‘how’? How do they sell?What is it, exactly, about Marilyn Monroe’s midriff in this photograph that getsus so excited? Actually, the answer to this question is simple. What we havehere is a biological caricature – a Bell Frog with a megaphone. Or, to put itanother way, a ‘synthetic’ key stimulus. Let me explain.Let us, for a moment, consider Herring Gulls. 9[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn9]Herring Gull chicks instinctivelyrespond to a small red spot located on the lower bill of the adult female.Pecking at this spot will result in the adult regurgitating food – the red spot,in other words, constituting a key stimulus. But what exactly is it about thisstimulus that makes it ‘key’? Research has indicated five major factors. Bypresenting the chick with different models of beak, it’s been shown, forinstance, that variations in the colour of both head and bill are actually oflittle significance. On the other hand, the red spot itself, narrowness of thebill, movement, low positioning of the head, and a downward pointing of the billare all essential in generating a response. In fact, so integral to the responseare these five core components that a refined, synthetic representation – whatis known as a supernormal set of stimuli – does the job even better. A thinbrown stick with three red stripes near the tip, when moved in a low position,elicits, over and above its original Darwinian prototype, not just a positiveresponse but an enhanced positive response. In other words, it pushes theHerring Gull’s pecking buttons even harder.Well, here’s the deal.Precisely these same processes of persuasion at work on Herring Gulls also workon humans – for exactly the same reasons, and by exactly the same mechanism.Super-toned tits and bums; genetically modified lips; six-packs chiselled out ofgranite; and legs that go on to infinity … all of these artefacts are the humansexual equivalents to those three red stripes and that thin brown stick. Theyare caricatures – quite literally – of the ‘red-spotted’ sexual stimuli thatmight, at one time or other, have first ‘caught our eye’. And so our responsesto them are enhanced.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_004_r1.jpg]Figure 1.4 – I’m not dumb, I’m just drawn that way. (photo credit 1.4)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c01-fig4a]WINNING HANDS DOWNFortunately for Herring Gulls, the commercial deployment of the key stimulusremains exclusive to humans. Yet it’s not just on a corporate level that we’resusceptible to this kind of influence. Flashes of the ancient – when persuasionwas made of biology rather than psychology – may also be glimpsed in simple,everyday behaviour. And when they occur they are dazzling.I’d been told about Marco Mancini by a friend of a friend at a party. She hadworked with him, once, at the Job Centre before handing in her notice and goingto live by the sea. She had left, in fact, after only a couple of months –struggling, as many had before her, to keep up the payments on her sanity. Fourtimes, one week, the fire extinguisher bounced off the wall. Not to extinguishfires, but rather to stoke them up, catapulting against the cast-iron securitygrille that had separated her work-station from the waiting area. Then someonepulled out a gun.Marco, she said, was different. And a lot of it was in the way that he spoke topeople. While everyone else cowered behind plate glass, Marco workedface-to-face – doing everything out in the open. He always had some coffee onthe go. And his desk was right in the middle, where anyone and everyone couldsee him. That, to her, seemed reckless in the extreme. Insane, even. And, I hadto admit, I agreed. But that was the funny thing. Despite all the trouble – andthere was, I was told, a lot of it – in the two and a half years that Marco hadbeen at the Job Centre, there wasn’t a single recorded instance of him everhaving been attacked. Not one.But there was something else about him, too. It wasn’t so much the way he talkedto people, it was also … no, she shook her head. But once people came intocontact with him they seemed to just … chill out. As if a switch had flicked orsomething. Nobody knew why, but everyone had noticed it. Maybe he was crazy,they said. And other crazy people picked up on it.I was surprised by Marco when I met him. I had expected … not sure, really. DeNiro in Heat? Pacino in Scent of a Woman? But I was confronted instead by atrendy, urban Jesus who looked like he worked in a juice-bar.‘So, Marco,’ I said. ‘In the two and a half years that you’ve worked at the JobCentre you’ve been trouble-free. What’s the secret?’The secret, it turned out, was surprisingly simple. He sat on his hands. That,plus there was something going on with the chairs. The one for the client facinghis desk was adjusted just that little bit higher than his own, so people couldliterally talk down to him while he listened. Oh, and one other thing. Oncethings had calmed down a little and the worst of it was over, he would look themin the eye, these angry, crazy people, and smile. And he would touch them, once,on the arm.‘I never forgot something that happened to me when I was ten,’ Marco told me.‘There was this kid at school and he had said something to the teacher about meand I was angry. Really angry. I went out looking for him in the playground, andwhen I found him I was going to beat the shit out of him. And then, when I didfind him, all I did was shout. And then I shut up.‘It was something about the way he was sitting. He was sitting low down, on awall, on his hands. I mean, how can you hit someone who’s sitting on theirhands? It’s like shooting someone in cold blood. How can they defend themselves?Plus he had his head down all the time I was shouting, and then he sort oflooked straight up at me, still sitting on his hands. It was like he was saying:OK, well, here I am. Hit me if you want. And I couldn’t. Somehow I justcouldn’t. So I left. I walked away.’Such an extraordinary feat of knife-edge persuasive genius should not beundertaken lightly. As well as making the right kind of moves, you need also –if you aspire to be the kind of flipnotist that Marco Mancini clearly is – todisplay the right kind of qualities: first and foremost, the confidence andempathy we touched upon briefly in the Introduction (and which, in animal form,we revisited earlier in this chapter). But the moves, nonetheless, are stillimportant – and here’s where it gets interesting. On closer inspection, theanatomy of Marco’s approach bears a striking similarity to the principles ofanimal appeasement: symbolic, ritualistic gestures aimed at defusing conflictand ‘talking your way out of trouble’. When escape is not on the menu, and youare.Take, for example, the thing with the chairs: one being higher than the other.If mimicry is empathy taken straight, then the primordial power of anappeasement key stimulus lies wholly in the art of surprise. Incongruity. Or, asDarwin puts it in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, the‘principle of antithesis’. A subordinate baboon – regardless of gender – willturn its back on an aggressor and present itself in the mating posture(pseudo-copulation). OK, the unfortunate subordinate might, on occasion,actually find itself mounted by the dominant party – thankfully, only briefly –but more often than not the gesture, the antithesis of aggression, is acceptedas submissive and the subordinate is granted clemency.Then there’s the sitting on the hands. 10[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn10]Recent work on crayfish goes onestep further than that on baboons – and suggests that appeasement might even bea superior strategy to dominance. When male crayfish compete for female mates,they show each other who’s boss by flipping their rivals over on to their backsand then assuming a mating posture. The subordinate animal has one of twochoices. It may, on the one hand, offer resistance. Or, on the other,antithetically, take up the receptive female position in submission. Fadi Issaand Donald Edwards of Georgia State University have discovered, much to thedelight of the more metrosexual members of the crayfish population, that kickingback and letting the macho types get on with it actually pays dividends. After24 hours of pairing off, half of the resisters were killed while all of thesubmitters survived.Taking it lying down, or in Marco’s case sitting down, clearly has itsadvantages.STOOPING TO CONQUERThe knowledge that we have of key stimuli, of how they work and of the powerfulinfluence they exert in the animal kingdom, allows us, as we just saw withMarco, to turn them to our own advantage. Just as the largest, sturdiestbuildings can be made to collapse under their own weight by the careful placingof explosives, so even the most intractable of problems can be dismantled by afew carefully bestowed words and gestures. Throughout history the greatpersuaders have known this.In the Gospel of St John, for example, Jesus finds himself cornered. ThePharisees present him with a woman accused of adultery, and petition him foradvice.‘Master,’ they say. ‘This woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. NowMoses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned. But what sayestthou?’The Pharisees, of course, aren’t really interested in Jesus’ moral take on thematter. And Jesus knows it. Instead, their motives are altogether lesssalubrious. What they’re actually trying to do is get him embroiled in a legalwrangle. According to Mosaic Law, the woman, as the scribes correctly point out,should be stoned. No problem there – under normal circumstances. But withPalestine now under Roman occupation, things have changed. Mosaic Law has cededto Roman Law – and if Jesus upholds the former over the latter, he leaveshimself open to the inevitable charge of incitement. But that’s the least of hisworries. Conversely, if he decrees that the woman should not be stoned, hestands accused of precisely the opposite charge – turning his back on theancient traditions of his forefathers. And that’s no picnic either.A crowd has gathered, and tensions are running high. Getting out of this, itwould seem, is a pretty hard ask even for the smoothest of smooth-talkers – letalone an itinerant carpenter with no rhetorical training whatsoever. Whathappened next is described thus:This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesusstooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard themnot. So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said untothem, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. Andagain he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, beingconvicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest,even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in themidst. (John, 8: 6–9; author’s emphases.)This passage from the Gospel of St John is unique. It’s the only recordedoccasion in the entire New Testament during which Jesus writes anything.Speculation is rife among Biblical scholars as to what those words might havebeen. The sins of the woman’s accusers? Their names, perhaps? They will, ofcourse, forever remain a mystery. But from a psychological perspective,precisely why Jesus should feel the need to write anything at such a momentconstitutes an even greater conundrum.It doesn’t make sense.Unless, that is, he had something up his sleeve. Might the words themselves havebeen a smokescreen? The significance of his actions lie less in the writingitself – and more in the act of producing it?Let’s take another look at Jesus’ body language during his encounter with thePharisees. The exchange, in fact, comprises three distinct phases. On firstbeing challenged, what is his initial reaction? Well, we note from the text thathe immediately ‘stoops down’ (antithesis: incongruity: appeasement). Then, whenthe elders persist in their sophistry, he ‘lifts himself’ back up again todeliver his famous riposte (confidence: assertiveness) – before reverting to astooping posture and resuming a pose of appeasement.It’s a well-crafted move aimed at shifting and stealing momentum.Sure, Jesus certainly has a great line in ‘casting the first stone’. And, what’smore, he almost certainly knew it: it’s one of the finest examples ofsplit-second persuasion I’ve ever come across. But he does, however, still havea problem. At the end of the day, no matter how great a line it may or may notbe, no matter how insightful the argument, it still delivers a challenge to thePharisees. And could, despite its genius, have seriously pissed them off.An eventuality, no doubt, of which Jesus was well aware.And which explains, contrary to theological conjecture, why he didn’t just speakin the one language, he spoke in two. One modern, phonemic, opaque. One ancient,silent, profound.FIRE AND RESCUEMarco Mancini and Jesus have little in common. True, Marco did look a bit likeJesus when I met him. But that, I would guess, is where the similarity ends.Marco first learned the secrets of split-second persuasion in the schoolplayground. Jesus … who knows? The point is that one doesn’t need supernaturalpowers to excel at persuasion like this. The ability lies within all of us. Butunlike our animal brethren, we have to work at it.Neither, of course, is such influence restricted to flashpoints. OK, it may,from time to time, help get us off a ticket. Or the end of somebody’s fists. Butit can also help us in other ways as well. Think about it. The more you can saywithout actually having to say it gives you one hell of an advantage no matterwhat situation you’re in.Take business. Research has shown that top salespeople often lean slightlyforward towards their clients when doing deals – a double whammy signifying notonly empathy (through increased proximity) but also a sneaky subservience.Or parenting. Next time you find yourself having to lay down the law to awayward six-year-old, try laying it up instead. Rather than towering over them,draw them up close, crouch down next to them, and then – in as calm a tone aspossible (I know, easier said than done) – say what you have to say. Bringingyourself down to someone’s level like this often speaks volumes. RememberChurchill and the dinner-party thief from the Introduction? What you are saying(without actually having to say it) is this: ‘Look – it’s not just you that’s inthe shit here. It’s both of us. So why don’t we see if we can’t work as a teamfrom now on.Deal?’Here’s Winston again – up to his old tricks.11 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c01-ftn11]In the summer of 1941, FlightSergeant James Allen Ward was awarded a Victoria Cross for clambering on to thewing of his Wellington bomber and – while flying 13,000 feet above the ZuiderZee – extinguishing a fire in the starboard engine. He was secured at the timeby just a single rope tied around his waist.Some time later, Churchill summoned the shy, swashbuckling New Zealander toNumber 10 Downing Street to congratulate him on his exploits.They got off to a shaky start.When the fearless, daredevil airman – tongue-tied in the presence of the greatman – found himself completely unable to field even the simplest of questionsput to him, Churchill tried something different.‘You must feel very humble and awkward in my presence,’ he began.‘Yes, sir,’ stammered Ward. ‘I do.’‘Then you can imagine,’ said Churchill, ‘how humble and awkward I feel inyours.’SUMMARYIn this chapter we’ve looked at the ancestry of influence. How persuasion wasdone before the advent of language, and how it’s still being done in the animalkingdom today. The conclusions we’ve come to are stark. With the arrival oflanguage, and the rise of the neocortex, persuasion, rather than becoming moreeffective, has actually become less so. When it comes to persuasion, animals dobetter than we do.The secret of persuasion in the animal world is thrift. In animals, the basicunits of influence are what ethologists call key stimuli – persuasion silverbullets which, when fired by one member of a species at another, generateinstinctive, pre-programmed response sets. These silver bullets – innate,immediate and incisive – resolve situations quickly, and with a minimum ofcognitive fallout. With humans, however, it’s different. Wedged between us andthe expediency of instinct is an ozone layer of consciousness – which language,our influence tool of choice, often finds hard to penetrate. Only the reallyspecial make it through.The question, of course, is how to fashion such influence? Are all of us capableof hitting these persuasion sweet spots? Or is it just the preserve of a handfulof influence elite?You may find the answer surprising. Each of us is born under the star ofpersuasion genius. But as we get older its lustre slowly wanes.1 Actually, not. The case is documented in Clifton K. Meador’s Symptoms ofUnknown Origin: A Medical Odyssey (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press,2005). It is also recounted in an article by Helen Pilcher (2009), ‘The Scienceand Art of Voodoo: When Mind Attacks Body’. New Scientist, 13 May, Issue 2708.2 The Seduction Community is a group of male pick-up artists who employ theprinciples of evolutionary social psychology to attract women. The community,and its practices, are documented in Neil Strauss’ The Game: Penetrating theSecret Society of Pickup Artists (Canongate, 2005).3 In this context I use the term ‘empathy’ rather loosely to refer, in theabsence of consciousness, to the capacity to ‘connect’ – to frame acommunication in such a way as to maximise salience to its recipient.4 And identity theft isn’t the only kind of racketeering that thesedouble-dealing lotharios have a hand in. Bell Frog psychopaths – of thenon-quonking fraternity – routinely mug their exhausted quonker buddies byleaping out of the shadows at the very last minute and accosting their females:the self-same females that their worn-out counterparts have just spent the wholeof the night serenading."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2FOETAL ATTRACTION1 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn1]A Houston lady just told me thather friend heard a crying baby on the porch the night before last so she calledthe police because it was late and she thought it was weird. The police toldher: ‘Whatever you do, do not open the door.’ The lady then said she thoughtthat the baby had crawled near a window and she was worried that it would crawlinto the street and get run over. The policeman said, ‘We already have a unit onthe way. Whatever you do, do not open the door.’ He told her that they thought aserial killer had a baby’s cry recorded and was using it to coax women out oftheir homes, thinking that someone had dropped off a baby. He said they had notverified it but had had several calls from women saying that they heard babies’cries outside their doors when they were home alone at night …‘The helpless cry of a human baby is not weak and ineffective and archaic. It isthe most profound and powerful force in nature. Until a father and mother firsthear it, parenthood lies dormant in them … The [infant’s] cry is not into spacebut down into the profound of human love and pity’ – Jonathan Hanaghan, Society,Evolution and RevelationPERSUASION PRODIGYI am sitting in a café in South London about to meet a man who, a couple ofyears ago, wouldn’t have been seen dead in a place like this. There are plentyof other joints he might have been seen dead in around here. But this place?With its Fair Trade mochas and Ugg boots? No. Here he comes now. Although I’venever seen him before I’m pretty certain it’s him. He’s tall – around 6′3″. Late20s. And has a tan. Not the kind of tan you get in Greece but the kind of parktan that winos get from hanging around on benches for long periods. His name isDaryl.Daryl has spotted me – I’m right, it is him – and he’s coming over. The firstthing I notice about him is the shaking. Somewhere in his brain the weather’sturned bad and some power lines are down. Then there’s the scar. And the amateurtattoos. And the sports bag, which he dumps against my leg. What’s in there? Ithink.A couple of years ago Daryl was part of a low-level crime syndicate thatoperated around these parts. He was high on crack for most of that time. And youname it, he did it. Everything from housebreaking to robbery to obtaining falsepassports.Then one day it all went right.Walking through a car-park one Saturday afternoon, he saw a woman loading someshopping into a car. He pulled out a knife and approached her from behind. Butwhen she turned round, Daryl got a surprise. Clasped between her arm and herbody was a newborn baby. He froze. She froze. They all froze. The baby juststared at him and Daryl stared back. Then the woman screamed, and he dropped theknife and ran. Then he went into rehab.‘I just don’t know what happened,’ he tells me as I sip my triple, no foam soyalatte, with one pump of sugar-free vanilla, swirled. ‘But something fucking did.The kid was a real shock. The way it looked at me … It was, like, whoah! I can’tbe dealing with this shit. I never wanted to hurt nobody. I just wanted money.You know, for smack and that. Once, like, that kid would have been me. How didit come to this? What happened to the kid I once was? I thought.’MISSION IMPOSSIBLEThe newborn baby is a persuasion machine. There’s no other way of putting it.The ability of the neonate to impose its will on others, to get its own way, totwist us round its tiny little fingers, is second to none. It has the techniquesof social influence down to a fine art.The human response to infants is pretty much universal across any demographicyou may care to mention. Culture, age, sex – you name it, the reaction is almostidentical. Take age. Studies have shown that infants as young as four monthslook longer at pictures of infant faces than they do at those of older childrenor adults. And that, by 18 months, this preference for infant faces isaccompanied not only by increased smiling, but by gesturing and vocalising too.2 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn2]More surprising still, perhaps,is that this doesn’t just happen in humans. From the age of about two months on,rhesus monkeys reared in isolation show a similar preference for picturesdepicting infant monkeys over those depicting adult monkeys. The appeal of theneonate is set in neural stone.These perceptual biases lurk deep within the brain. 3[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn3]Research conducted byneuroscientist Morten Kringelbach at the University of Oxford reveals that whenpictures of newborns are viewed under MEG (magnetoencephalography – an imagingtechnique that monitors brain activation in milliseconds), the area of the brainthat encodes for rewarding stimuli – the medial orbitofrontal cortex – respondsalmost immediately: within one-seventh of a second of the images firstappearing.Our brains, says Kringelbach, have a built-in propensity to ‘tag’ infant facesas special.Precisely why the newborn should be so persuasive is not exactly rocket science.Like many things in life it essentially boils down to marketing. Chimpanzeebabies fuss. Seagull chicks squawk. Burying beetle larvae tap their parents’legs. Throughout the animal kingdom, newborns display a consummate knack forengaging their parents’ attention – exhibiting an eclectic array of ingeniouskey stimuli to elicit nurturance and inhibit adult aggression.Such advertising is of the utmost importance. There was a time (not that weremember it too well) when each of us – alone and without back-up – first showedup for life. It was a pretty risky manoeuvre. Consider the enormity of theinitial challenge that faced us. Somehow, from the very first moment we cameinto this world, we had to influence those around us – without thought, withoutlanguage, without control of even the most basic of bodily functions – to takecare of us. Somehow we had to persuade them it was worth it.Nowadays, of course, we take all this for granted. Because we made it. Not, Ishould add, through any recourse of our own (if we’d had anything to do with it,who knows what might have happened?) but through the genius of naturalselection. Through power of biological attorney, natural selection saw us on ourway: equipping us not just with one key attribute – the ability to raise hell –but with three. Three key stimuli of social influence, fitted as standard, wefind tantalisingly irresistible: * the ability to cry with brilliant acoustical efficiency; * a devilish cuteness (which, for those fortunate enough to hang on to it, also works in later life as well); * and a hypnotic capacity to make eye contact.Persuasion, no matter what its shape or form, comes no more incisive than that.In this chapter we continue our quest for the origins of social influence, theprimaeval lineage of changing the minds of others, by looking a little moreclosely at these three key stimuli of neonatal influence. What precisely is itabout crying that makes it so special? And what are the features of newborninfant faces that cast such a spell on us?WIRED FOR SOUNDInstant influence isn’t something we come across all that often in the sphere ofhuman interaction. We saw as much in the previous chapter[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c01_r1.htm]. With us, unlike animals, things usuallytake time. This is largely because we have brains big enough to drive a busthrough. We have the ability to learn. To reflect. To decide. And then to talkabout it afterwards. But dotted along the bus route lurk vestiges of the past:ancient, disused stations that can sometimes come back to life. Certain modes ofcommunication, certain means of interaction, can, to this day, make us do stuffwithout our even thinking, thanks to their overarching importance in ourevolutionary history. There are times in our lives when our brains give reasonthe elbow.4 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn4]In 1998, the Pentagoncommissioned Pam Dalton of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia tocome up with something unusual. Intrigued by the somewhat Pythonesque notion ofcontrolling public order by smell, the US government put Dalton in charge of theworld’s most dangerous chemistry experiment. She was to create, for the firsttime in history, a universally repellent bouquet. Could there, wondered seniorofficials in the United States Defense Department, exist something so malodorousas to disperse a rampaging mob on a moment’s exposure?Dalton found out that there could.In fact, she discovered there wasn’t just one such infusion but two. A pair ofequally odiferous concoctions that transcended not only all known individualdifferences, but all known cultural divides as well: the aptly named USGovernment Standard Bathroom Malodour (which comprises – surprise surprise – theconcentrated stench of human faeces), and the equally apt, though somewhatelliptically named, Who Me? (a hideous collection of sulphur molecules whichsimulates the mephitic aroma of rotting carcasses and spoilt food). Results, onemight say, not to be sniffed at.Technological advancement has often proved the well-spring of inspiration – andanyone who has ever had to toss and turn on a windy night while theirneighbour’s car-alarm goes off in the driveway next door, or who has been drivento distraction by the idiot opposite’s customised ringtone, will no doubt bewondering if similar research has not been conducted on sound. It has. Snoring,squabbling, coughing and farting are among the primary contenders here.To many, this may come as something of a surprise. 5[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn5]Compared to the racket of athree-pronged garden pitchfork being scraped across slate – revealed by a studyin the 1980s as being the most likely candidate to elicit disgruntlement – thesemore ‘organically’ flavoured sounds appear fairly innocuous. But as Trevor Coxof the University of Salford’s Acoustics Research Centre points out, theinference of irritation from the physics of a sound wave alone is not asstraightforward as first it might appear. There’s psychology in the mix as well.‘The boom-boom of your neighbour’s hi-fi isn’t so annoying if you are going tojoin the party later,’ Cox says. And he’s right. In short, as is the case withmany potential stressors, the amount of stress that actually occurs depends onhow much control the recipient has, or perceives they have, over theirsurroundings. ‘If you have control over the noise, it tends to be lessannoying,’ says Cox. ‘But if you are fearful of the source, then it usuallymakes it worse.’6 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn6]British inventor Howard Stapletonhas recently put Cox’s theory to the test. Quite literally, in the marketplace.His Mosquito device – designed, like Dalton’s irresistibly repellent odours, toreduce anti-social behaviour by dispersal – emits an irritating, high-pitchedwarbling sound of such a frequency as to be inaudible to anyone over the age of30. The contraption, dubbed an ‘electromechanical teenager repellent’, iscurrently in use in high streets and shopping malls right across the UK, and isproving at least as successful as its predecessor in the war on yobbishness:Wagner. Somewhat more muscular than coughing and farting (it weighs in at 85decibels – about the same as a lawn-mower) yet not sufficiently macho as toinflict actual physical harm, Mosquito’s main advantage appears to be itsnuisance value. Latest reports suggest it’s doing well.1THE CRYING GAME7 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn7]The normal range of adult humanhearing stretches from approximately 40Hz to 15KHz. The range covered by thehuman voice is typically that between 100Hz and 7Khz. And then there’s the pointat which human hearing is at its most acute: around 3.5KHz. From the standpointof natural selection, this is interesting. A number of sounds operate atfrequencies of around the 3.5 KHz mark (submarine sonar, for example) – soundsspecifically developed for scenarios in which a high premium is placed onattentional resources.Yet there’s another sound, pitching in at around 200–600Hz, which has a somewhatlonger lineage. And which, of all the acoustical stimuli known to man, placesthe greatest demands of any on our attention: the crying of a human infant.An infant’s cry is genius made sound – the profoundest thing that can everhappen to an air molecule. It operates at two fundamental, though not unrelated,levels of influence: physiological and psychological. In common with other alarmand emergency signals, its acoustical properties evolved, quite literally, undercover of darkness – eliciting attention, and conveying position to caregiverswhile at the same time minimising location cues to predators. (The high-pitchedfrequencies of infant vocalisations aren’t as aerodynamic as low-pitchedfrequencies – favouring nearby members of one’s own species over distant roamingkillers.)But there’s more to the cry of the neonate than just the provision oflocalisation cues. In addition to its base-station benefits, its tonal, gradedsignal elicits an instinctive physiological response set in caregivers: cardiacdeceleration followed by rapid acceleration (associated with imminent action orintervention), together with elevated breast temperature and a milk-letdownreflex – which makes the breasts feel heavy and stimulates the mother to feed.Back in the days of our ancestors, an infant’s cry was the ultimate 911 call.Pizza delivery, too.Paradoxically, however, infant crying ‘grates’. Though its auditoryrepresentation falls short of the range of ‘maximum acoustic unpleasantness’2(its high-pitched tone is high enough not to carry, but sufficiently low so asnot to engender aggression), the cry of the neonate is up there on virtuallyeveryone’s list of aversive acoustic stimuli – men and women, parents andchildren alike – evoking anxiety, distress, and overwhelming urges to ‘help’.The equivalent, in sound and empathy, of US Government Standard BathroomMalodour.8 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn8]In 2007, Kerstin Sander of theLeibnitz Institute for Neurobiology in Germany demonstrated precisely how deepan infant’s cry goes. Sander played recordings of four different cries to agroup of 18 adults (nine men, nine women) while they underwent fMRI.3 She thenscrambled the cries (splitting each recording into 150 millisecond segments),recombined the fragments, and compared what happened next. Would patterns ofbrain activity remain constant across both crying conditions? Sander wanted toknow. Or would the scrambling make a difference?Her findings bore testament to the choreographic genius of natural selection.Results revealed a dramatic increase in both amygdala activity (the part of thebrain which processes emotion) and anterior cingulate cortex activity (the partof the brain sensitive to anomaly) when the real cries were played as opposed tothe scrambled segments. But more so for women than for men – a pattern, Sandersuggests, which may reflect a specific neural predisposition in women to respondto preverbal infant vocalisation (see Figure 2.1).[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_005_r1.jpg]Figure 2.1a (left) – Approximate areas of female brain activity on hearing anadult crying. Shaded sections indicate areas of increased brain activity.

Aninfant’s cry, contrary to outward appearance, isn’t quite as simple as it seems.WHEN THE WRONG NOTE HITS THE RIGHT NOTEAnd nor, it would appear, as uniform, either. Additional research has probed alittle deeper – and revealed that although preverbal infant vocalisations doindeed increase amygdala activation, it is sudden, dramatic and unexpectedchanges in crying pitch – known as ‘gliding’ or ‘vibrato’ – that convey the mostemotion, and elicit in caregivers the most powerful affective responses.Moreover, it’s precisely these same unexpected shifts that move us so intenselywhen it comes to music: that send a shiver up our spines, that create thatinimitable ‘tingle factor’. It’s not the predictable resolution of chords thatloosens the screw-top on our emotions. Nor, for that matter, in comedy, is itthe expected that makes us laugh. It’s the dotty, ecstatic ignominy of beingmistaken.As an example, take the following. 9[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn9]Paul Rozin and his colleagues atthe University of Pennsylvania have drawn attention to a common pattern thatexists in humour – what they call the AAB pattern. We all know what it is:(A1) Some men are about to be executed. The guard brings the first man forward,and the executioner asks if he has any last requests. He says no, and theexecutioner shouts, ‘Ready! Aim!’Suddenly the man yells, ‘Earthquake!’Everyone is startled and looks around. In all the confusion, the first manescapes.(A2) The guard brings the second man forward, and the executioner asks if he hasany last requests. He says no, and the executioner shouts, ‘Ready! Aim!’Suddenly the man yells, ‘Tornado!’Everyone is startled and looks around. In all the confusion, the second manescapes.(B) The last man has it all figured out. The guard brings him forward, and theexecutioner asks if he has any last requests. He says no, and the executionershouts, ‘Ready! Aim!’And the last man yells, ‘Fire!’In this particular joke (I’ve got others), the violation – B – involves a rivalinterpretation of the final word. The expectation is one of another disasterword. But in reality, when it comes, it has a different, calamitous, andradically pertinent undertone. Perhaps less well-known, however, is the AABpattern in music.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_006_r1.jpg]Figure 2.2 – The AAB structure in the initial theme from Mozart, Piano Sonata inA major, K. 331, I (Andante grazioso), mm. 1–4.Here, we see the original five-note motif (A1) repeated a tone lower (A2), thenbegin again another step lower (B). Only in this third instance, it changes formto a different note sequence entirely. Such ‘script reversals’ are common withina wide variety of musical genres from classical and contemporary through toBroadway and jazz. As well as, needless to say, forming the basis of countless‘Englishman, Irishman, Scotsman’ and ‘Priest, Minister, Rabbi’ jokes.Does such manifest incongruity, such conspicuous violation of expectation,constitute a universal law of persuasion? Quite possibly. It’s certainly acomponent of what Darwin had in mind with his principle of antithesis – thescript reversal so integral to appeasement displays in animals. And, as we sawin the previous chapter [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c01_r1.htm], humans too.‘10 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn10]Music,’ writes V. S.Ramachandran of the University of California’s Center for Brain and Cognition,‘may involve generating peak shifts in certain primitive, passionate primatevocalisations such as a separation cry; the emotional response to such soundsmay be partially hardwired in our brains.’11 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn11]David Huron, in his book SweetAnticipation: Music and the Psychology of Expectation, goes one step further.‘Forming expectations,’ argues Huron, ‘is what humans and other animals do tosurvive; only by predicting the future can we be ready for it. And because thebrain ensures that accurate prediction is rewarded, we feel good when we areproved right. The link between prediction and reward causes us to constantlyseek out structure and predict how events will unfold. As a temporally evolvingtexture, music is a super-stimulus for such predictions.’In other words when expectations are violated, our brains (more specifically,areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex and parts of the temporoparietaljunction) are moved to restore homeostasis. To counteract the aversive emotionthat accompanies such violation. In the arts – music and comedy, for instance –such aversive emotion is all part of the deal. From the comfort of our armchair,or the safety of the dress circle, we place ourselves quite willingly in thehands of the performer.But in other areas of life we’re not so charitably disposed. When an event orstimulus defies prediction we’re forced to do something about it: either todiscredit or to eradicate it. Or else to rethink our position. Which is why it’svirtually impossible – especially for caregivers – to ignore a baby’s cry. Notonly does the sound itself generate aversive feelings, so too do deep, essentialelements of its structure.BEAUTY AND THE BESTYou can spot them a mile off. In fact they’re probably visible from outer space– those guys in the shopping mall with clipboards. For some reason, it alwaysseems to happen when you’re in a hurry. Or have discovered, just moments before,that your house is on fire.‘Can you just spare a couple of minutes to answer a few questions …’Many of us have evolved elaborate strategies in the face of such a predicament.Persistent coughing. Mobile phones springing suddenly into life. And thespontaneous appearance of imaginary acquaintances on the other side of the road.All of which count for nothing, of course, should the person holding theclipboard be a fit, attractive blonde. In which case, far from plucking out ourown eyeballs in the desire to avoid visual contact, most of us form a line.To a social psychologist, one well versed in the vicissitudes of interpersonalattraction, such an occurrence will come as no great surprise. It’s a well-knownfact that good-looking people accrue more signatures on petitions than theirface-like-a-slapped-arse counterparts, and that charity stands manned bygood-looking volunteers generate increased takings. In the law courts, too,attractiveness plays its part. Good-looking defendants are less likely to befound guilty than those of average appearance. And, in the eventuality that theyare, receive lighter sentences. Good-looking people are good.4Flick through the pages of a dozen pop psychology mags and you’ll be hardpressed not to encounter a hundred such claims as these. Good-looking people arebetter at such-and-such. Average-looking people do worse. Yeah, yeah. Butwhere’s the evidence? 13 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn13]MarkSnyder at the University of Minnesota conducted a study in which male studentswere presented with an information pack containing details relating to a fellowfemale student (in reality, an associate of the researchers). These detailsincluded a mocked-up photograph of the student which had been designated by theresearchers as either attractive or unattractive. Under the pretence ofdiscussing coursework requirements, the researchers then contrived a ten-minutetelephone conversation between the participants and their fellow ‘students’ (inall cases, the same person) and observed the way in which the participantsinteracted. Would attractiveness impact on telephone manner? they wondered.The answer was yes. Big time. Participants who believed that the person theywere talking to was attractive responded to her in a warmer, more positivefashion than those who believed she was unattractive. Furthermore, when asked,prior to the conversation, to record their initial impressions of the student,expectations clearly differed on the basis of attractiveness. The participantswho were presented with the attractive photograph anticipated interacting withan outgoing, humorous, and socially skilled individual. The participants who gotthe ugly photo, didn’t.5BRAIN TEASER15 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn15]In 2007, in a study involvinglap-dancers, strip clubs and sex pheromones, the evolutionary psychologistGeoffrey Miller uncovered another predictor of attraction – this time in theadult entertainment industry. Over a period of a couple of months, Miller andhis co-investigators Joshua Tybur and Brent Jordan took 5,300 erotic performers(yes, that is the correct number) and divided them into three groups: those whowere ovulating, those who were menstruating, and those who were in between. Thequestion was simple. Which of the three groups would make the most money by theend of their 5-hour shift?According to the precepts of evolutionary psychology, it should have been thegirls who were ovulating. In the event of anyone getting lucky, this was thegroup most likely to conceive. And they did. Make more money, that is. True toform, punters found the ovulating dancers more appealing. And, in a show ofappreciation, coughed up. In fact, the results of the experiment couldn’t haveturned out better. On average, the ovulators made $325 in tips. The menstruators$185. And those in between, $260.Miller’s study is intriguing for a number of reasons. But the main one is this.Much of the time we are as able to put into words why we find someone attractiveas we are able to put into words why we like the particular type of music thatwe do. Sure, we might invoke specific aspects of that music such as the rhythmor the harmony, but the questions still remain. Why that particular rhythm? Whythat harmony?Let’s, in a manner of speaking, turn the tables on Miller for a moment and lookat a predictor of male attractiveness. In 16[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn16]Figure 2.3, which face do youthink is the better-looking. The one on the left? Or the one on the right?[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_007_r1.jpg]Figure 2.3 – Spot the difference. (photo credit 2.3)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c02-fig3a]Generally speaking, most women go for the face on the right. Unless they areovulating, in which case they go for the other one. But ovulating or not, theyjust can’t put their finger on why. 17[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn17]David Perrett, on the other hand,of St Andrews University in Scotland, knows exactly where to put his finger: onimperceptible cues of gender enhancement. In a jaw-mashing blow to ArnoldSchwarzenegger and his pals, Perrett has found that women, on average, actuallyprefer men’s faces when they are made just that little bit more like their own.When they are feminised, in other words. Here, the face on the right has beenfeminised by 30 per cent – the optimal amount to maximise attractiveness. Thejawbone, you will notice, has been rounded and smoothed out. And the foreheadand eye regions softened. But during ovulation the trend mysteriously reverses.For women who are ovulating, it’s actually masculine facial features that provethe bigger turn-on. Stronger, robuster, they ruggedly allude to greaterimmunological competence – a heritable resistance to disease – and faces thatembody a more macho physiognomy assume a subtly heightened significance (seeFigure 2.4a, below).[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_008_r1.jpg]Figure 2.4a – During ovulation, women generally prefer the characteristics ofmore masculine faces such as that of Bruce Willis (left) over the more femininefeatures of, say, Leonardo DiCaprio (right). The enhanced appeal of faces suchas that of British actor Robert Pattinson (Figure 2.4b), lies in theircombination of both masculine AND feminine attributes – note the refinedjawline, full lips, and low, prominent eyebrows. (photo credit 2.4a)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c02-fig30a][images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_009_r1.jpg]Figure 2.4b (photo credit 2.4b) [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c02-fig4ba]On the other hand, however, there’s one marker of attractiveness that prettymuch suckers all of us; that cuts through the crap of conscious–unconsciousprocessing and, just like the good-looking student in the telephone experiment,plays upon our better natures. This is the mark of the baby face.YOU’VE GOT THE CUTEST LITTLE BABY FACE18 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn18]In 1943, in his classic paper‘The Innate Forms of Potential Experience’, the Austrian ethologist KonradLorenz put forward a radical notion. Human beings, he proposed, are equippedwith a built-in preference for infant facial features over the facial featuresof adults. The primary reason for this preference, he contended, centres oncaregiving. An innate perceptual bias towards the faces of neonates increasesthe incentive to protect and look after vulnerable members of the species. Toillustrate his point, Lorenz produced a series of silhouettes of both human andanimal infant faces which delineated a distinct subset of features –kindchenschema (or baby schema) as he called them – that were common to both: asoft, round cranial shape; a wide curved forehead; large round eyes; and roundprotruding cheeks (see 19 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn19]Figure2.5 below). These, he argued, instinctively hotwired attraction and opened thedoor to compassion. They were the human key stimuli of nurturance.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_010_r1.jpg]Figure 2.5 – Cross-species similarity in babyish versus mature facialcharacteristics. (photo credit 2.5)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c02-fig5a]Subsequent research into the science of facial attractiveness has revealedseveral more of these kindchenschema: a small chin; a small, short nose; and therelatively ‘low’ positioning of the eyes, nose and mouth. All of which, it wouldseem, are the epitome of ‘cute’. In fact, so powerful are such stimuli insignifying immaturity that they even transfer to random, inanimate objects.20 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn20]Consider, for example, theseries of craniofacial profiles illustrated below in Figure 2.6:[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_011_r1.jpg]Figure 2.6 – Changes in craniofacial profile shape with increasing maturity.(photo credit 2.6) [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c02-fig6a]Here, the shape of the head has been sequentially modified using a mathematicaltransformation that simulates, on cranial geometry, the effects of maturation.Few of us have any difficulty in identifying the direction of increased maturityas proceeding from left to right. Yet here’s the deal. Not only do we find iteasy to differentiate between a mature and infantile head shape – we also findit easy with mature and infantile cars!21 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn21]Take a look at Figure 2.7, forinstance, overleaf. The same mathematical function just used to simulate cranialmaturation has also been applied to one of the Volkswagen Beetles.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_012_r1.jpg]Figure 2.7 – Babyish versus mature craniofacial characteristics in motorvehicles.

Which of the Beetles iscuter?FACING UP TO RESPONSIBILITY22 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn22]In 2009, Melanie Glocker of theInstitute of Neural and Behavioural Biology at the University of Munsterconducted an experiment to test Lorenz’s theory. Do we really findkindchenschema more appealing? And, if so, how are such preferences reflected inthe brain? Using a similar technique to that of Morten Kringelbach, Glockerpresented participants with pictures of newborn infants while they underwentfMRI. Only this time she went a step further. Whereas in Kringelbach’s study thepictures were always true likenesses, Glocker, using a special image-editprogram, manipulated the images so that some were more ‘babyish’ than others:[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_013_r1.jpg]Figure 2.8 – Manipulated (low/high) and unmanipulated baby schema. (photo credit2.8) [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c02-fig8a]The results turned out exactly as Lorenz would have predicted. Analysis revealedthat the higher the index of kindchenschema (e.g. the larger the eyes and therounder and chubbier the face), the greater the activity in participants’nucleus accumbens – the part of the brain, in both humans and animals, thatmediates reward. Not only were there kindchenschema, Glocker discovered, butsuper-kindchenschema, too.Glocker’s adventures deep within the brain have their parallels in everydaylife. Imagine you found a wallet on the street. What would you do? Report it tothe police? Post it back to the owner? Er … hang on to it? 23[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn23]Psychologist Richard Wiseman ofthe University of Hertfordshire posed exactly this question to the people ofEdinburgh. Only there was a catch – he did it for real. Wiseman left a bunch ofwallets on the streets of the Scottish capital, each containing one of fourphotographs: a smiling, happy couple; a cute, cuddly puppy; a contented elderlycouple; and a beaming, bouncing baby.Which ones, he wondered, would find their way back to their ‘owners’ most often?He certainly got his answer. Of the 40 wallets of each type that were dropped,28 per cent of the contented elderly couples made it back successfully; 48 percent of the smiling, happy families; 53 per cent of the cute, cuddly puppies,and a whopping 88 per cent of the beaming, bouncing babies.‘The baby kicked off a caring feeling in people,’ says Wiseman – a nurturinginstinct towards vulnerable infants that has evolved to safeguard the survivalof future generations.24 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn24]Another study in America evokeda similar kind of protectiveness by pinning a picture of a baby’s face to adartboard. Participants were given six darts and were paid a quarter for everydart that hit the target. Despite the fact that they’d had six ‘warm up’ throwsusing a face-shaped circle, guess what? Participants were less accurate whenaiming at the baby’s face than they had been previously.And it’s not just studies with neonates that lend credence to Wiseman’s claims.Studies involving adults with ‘baby faces’ also suggest that there’s something alittle bit special about the features of newborn infants. 25[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn25]Sheila Brownlow and LeslieZebrowitz of Brandeis University conducted a systematic analysis of 150television commercials. How, they wondered, did content and presenter match up?To find out, they solicited the help of two groups of college students. Onegroup of students read through transcripts of the commercials, rating as theydid so the degree of trustworthiness and expertise reflected in each message.The other group viewed recordings – this time rating the faces of thecommunicators on a scale of facial maturity.5 But there was a catch. Crucially,these latter ratings (those for faces) were provided in the absence of sound –thus entailing a ‘double dissociation’ between the information known to eachgroup. The first group got the message without the faces. The second got thefaces without the message. How would the two compare?Results revealed a tell-tale pattern. On those occasions when the persuasiveappeal relied less on expertise (the knowledgeable communication of objectiveand valid facts) and more on trustworthiness (the sincere and honest endorsementof a product user), it was the actors or actresses with baby faces that tendedto front the commercial. In contrast, however, when the flavour of the appealveered more toward the ‘factual’, so the face of the spokesperson morphed intogreater maturity.And such contours of persuasiveness aren’t just found in advertising. 26[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn26]In politics, too, they’re alsowell represented. Research has shown that when voters believe a candidate to beacting out of self-interest, it’s ‘honest’ baby-faced politicians, as opposed totheir more ‘inscrutable’ mature-faced colleagues, who are rated the morepersuasive. In contrast, however, when it’s expertise that’s under themicroscope, it’s the ‘shrewd’, more mature-faced politicians that are found tobe better persuaders.It’s actually rather interesting to compare the faces of different politicians,to see how they fare in the honesty stakes. 27[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn27]Back in 2008, a team from theUniversity of Kent got 100 members of the public to rate a series of faces on ascale of 1 to 5 for how trustworthy they seemed. From the data, they thenassimilated a number of features generally associated with honesty: a fuller,more rounded face; a softer, smoother jawline; big, round eyes; and softereyebrows. Ring any bells? Facial hair was viewed with deep suspicion, but arefined nose and a larger, thinner mouth were also rated positively.Using a digital image-enhancement program, the team fed in faces of variouspoliticians and examined the difference between how they appeared ‘normally’ –in everyday life – and their trustworthy/untrustworthy avatars. The programwasn’t the only thing that raised eyebrows. Take a look below, in Figure 2.9a,at the disparity between Gordon Brown’s normal facial features and those of his‘trusted-up’ clone. Then, in Figure 2.9b, do the same for David Cameron. Browncomes off worse because of his ‘thick eyebrows, wide nose, and the size of hismouth’. Cameron, on the other hand, has a ‘fresh-faced, smooth complexion, widermouth, and more rounded eye-shape’.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_014_r1.jpg]Figures 2.9a and 2.9b – Digitally-manipulated images of Gordon Brown and DavidCameron showing (left to right) the original image, trustworthy features, anduntrustworthy features.

Researchers have, in fact,uncovered all sorts of differences between baby-faced and mature-facedindividuals. Or, more specifically, in the ways we interact with them. 28[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn28]In relationships, women are morelikely to confide in a baby-faced friend than in one who looks more mature. Inthe courtroom, baby-faced defendants are more likely to be found guilty ofcrimes involving negligence than those involving intentional misconduct (thereverse being true for mature-faced individuals). And in the workplace,baby-faced individuals are less likely than their mature-faced colleagues tohold positions of power.29 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn29]Take the four photographs ofmilitary cadets shown below:[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_015_r1.jpg]Figure 2.10a – Portraits taken from The Howitzer, 1950.

Theyhad been married for eight years. Beachy Head is a notorious spot for suicides.In 2004 alone there were some 30 recorded cases there. Earlier on the day of herdeath, Keith, a window cleaner from Eastbourne, had received a phone call fromMaggie at work, but had noticed nothing unusual. Later he heard the news.Several days on, after the initial horror had had time to sink in, Keith took atrip in his car. He felt drawn to the place where his wife had spent her lastmoments. Wanted to see with his own eyes what she had seen with hers. But aftersurveying the scene for a few gut-wrenching seconds, his attention was drawn toa woman. She was young, around 20, with a pen and some paper in her hand. Andwas sitting on a bench, in a T-shirt, staring out to sea.At first Keith thought nothing of it. She was a writer, perhaps. Or an artist.But then his mind started racing. What exactly was she writing, he wondered.Could she be another Maggie? Unable to settle, he decided to go over and talk toher. As soon as he reached her, he realized he’d made the right call.His emotions still raw from the shock of Maggie’s death, Keith was on dangerousground. It had, after all, been only a matter of days. Yet despite the savageimmediacy of his loss – in fact, maybe in hindsight because of it – he triedevery trick in the book to talk the woman down. He even mentioned Maggie byname. But the more he pleaded, the more her resolve seemed to harden.‘My family couldn’t give a damn about me,’ she told him. ‘Is there really anypoint in going on?’Eventually, she’d had enough. She shoved what she’d written between the woodenslats of the bench and started to make a run for it. Keith ran after her. Theedge was no more than 15, maybe 20, metres away.‘All my schoolboy rugby training came back to me,’ he recalls, ‘as I dived forher legs and just hoped for the best.’That training came in handy. Keith, it turned out, succeeded in hanging on.Quite literally for dear life.To say that the woman was grateful would, to put it mildly, be pushing it.Closer to the truth, she was livid. Several days later, when Keith went to visither in hospital, she slammed the door in his face. But eventually she got roundto thanking him.And then he had an idea. If he could save the life of one potential suicide, whynot those of others? In fact, why not set up a watch on Beachy Head for exactlythis reason? So he did.In November 2009, some five and a half years after Maggie had ended her life, Ispoke to Keith in Eastbourne. Life on the edge was over for him by then, and theBeachy Head Watch - 6 members strong and 29 souls to the good – had beendisbanded. Run-ins with the authorities had gradually taken their toll. As hadthe accusations.7‘What did you do,’ I asked him, ‘when you saw someone intent on taking their ownlife? What did you say to them?’His answer was intriguing.The best predictor of a successful talking down, he replied, was eye contact.‘When I looked at them and they looked at me,’ he told me, ‘that’s when I knew Ihad them.’NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THATKeith Lane’s comments will come as no great surprise to anyone who has ever hadto pull out into traffic at a busy road junction. The trick, as everyone knows,is to make eye contact with oncoming drivers. Once eye contact has beenestablished, the chances of being let out increase dramatically. This is whyit’s much more difficult to enter a flow of traffic in sunny weather than it iswhen it’s raining. Reason may dictate that motorists will be in a better moodwhen the sun is out, but nine times out of ten they’ll also be wearing shades.Similarly, one fares better during the hours of daylight than at night. Put itanother way. How many times have you accidentally blocked someone in and thengone to inordinate lengths to avoid making eye contact? See what I mean? Eyecontact – just like cute looks – is a human key stimulus of persuasion.8During the early days of his career, the British film actor Michael Caine had anintuitive grasp of the persuasive power of eyes. In a fiendish campaign aimed atraising his Hollywood profile, Caine began by training himself not to blink – tomaximise the intensity of his close-ups (when his eyes, magnified on screen,might be a couple of feet across) and reduce the chances of the director cuttingaway from him. An audience, Caine reasoned, enjoyed being paid attention to. Andby actively endeavouring to fix them with his gaze, he could enhance theillusion that he actually found them attractive. Plus, of course, the opposite:how attractive they found him.Empirical research substantiates Caine’s chicanery. Take simple, everydaypersuasion. Imagine I present you with an argument you don’t agree with. I runyou through the pros and cons, then attempt to get you on side. How can Iimprove my chances of eventually winning you over? One way, it’s beendemonstrated, is if I increase the amount of eye contact I have with you.Studies reveal that two people engaged in conversation don’t look at each otherin equal measure. The person who’s listening looks directly at the person who’stalking on average around 75 per cent of the time – compared to just 40 per centeye contact from talker to listener. But up this latter figure to around 50 percent (any more and it starts to get uncomfortable) and a definite air ofauthority begins to filter through.30 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn30]Statistics like these oftencome as a surprise to many people – though most of us, finding ourselves on thereceiving end in such situations, certainly ‘get’ it. Can such a small incrementin eye contact really make a difference? The answer, almost always, is yes.Research has shown that eye contact can account for as much as 55 per cent ofinformation transmission in a given conversation – the rest being apportionedbetween ‘non-verbal auditory’ (e.g. intonation) at 38 per cent, and ‘formal’verbal content at just 7 per cent. This is just one of the reasons whypsychopaths – those undisputed kings of persuasion we shall be meeting later –enjoy the reputation that they do. On average, psychopaths tend to blink justthat little bit less than the rest of us – a physiological aberration that oftengives them their unnerving, hypnotic air.‘There is a road,’ G. K. Chesterton once said, ‘from the eye to the heart thatdoes not go through the intellect.’THE EYES HAVE ITNewborn babies have much in common with psychopaths. Ask any parent. They lackempathy, are superficially charming, possess not the slightest sense of theconsequences of their actions, and are out purely for themselves. But they alsoshare something else with their über-cool, super-smooth counterparts: the powerto mesmerise with their eyes. This latter observation is well known to anyonewho has ever caught the eye of an infant and attempted to stare them out. Unlessyou’re Uri Geller, forget it.But babies don’t just catch our eyes on a random basis. Studies have revealedthat such perceptual orientation is actually hardwired – in both them and us. 31[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn31]In 2007, a team from theUniversity of Geneva compared the degree of ‘attentional capture’ by pictures ofadult and infant faces on a computerised reaction-time task. Results showed thatreaction times were slower on presentation of the infant faces – indicative oftheir greater ‘distraction’ properties.32 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn32]Conversely, psychologist TeresaFarroni of the University of London showed paired photographs of faces toinfants between the ages of two and five days old. In one of the photographs theeyes were oriented forwards, in the other they were averted. What she found wasremarkable: the babies looked longer at the faces that they could make eyecontact with than at those they couldn’t. A follow-up study also revealedenhanced electrical activity in the brains of four-month-olds on orientingtowards faces with a direct gaze. And it would seem that we never really outgrowsuch a bias. Research conducted in art galleries shows that whenever we look atportraits our attention is directed primarily at eye regions. But why? What arewe getting from this? Why the eyes as opposed to, say, the mouth or the nose?One answer to this question has to do with survival. There’s nothingparticularly special about eyes per se that attracts us, it’s more about wherethey’re pointing. During the course of our evolutionary history, the suddenorientation of eye-gaze to a particular location would have acted as a powerfulcue to potential sources of threat, and receptiveness to such cues would haveconferred a considerable advantage when it came to avoiding danger.33 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn33]To demonstrate, Chris Friesenof North Dakota State University and Alan Kingstone of the University of BritishColumbia have designed an experiment that captures precisely this power ofattentional cueing. The procedure comprises three phases. In the first phase,schematically drawn faces with featureless, blanked-out eyes appear at thecentre of a computer screen for about half a second. In the second phase thepupils of the eyes materialise, orienting in one of three different directions:straight ahead; to the left; or to the right (see Figure 2.11, below). Lastly,in phase three, a letter (an F or a T) appears on either the left- or theright-hand side of the screen – in other words, in either the same or theopposite direction to that in which the eyes are looking. What, Friesen andKingstone wanted to know, would be the effect of these differently oriented eyeregions on attention – specifically, on the way we process information in ourenvironment? Would the direction of eye-gaze facilitate the speed at whichindividuals specified the position of the target? Or alternatively have littleeffect?[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_017_r1.jpg]Figure 2.11 – Schematic faces with different gaze orientations similar to thoseused by Friesen and Kingstone. (photo credit 2.11)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c02-fig11a]The answer couldn’t have been clearer. Performance speeded up. Results showedthat individuals were faster at indicating the location of the target letter(left or right) on congruent trials (when the letter appeared in the samedirection as that in which the eyes were looking) than on incongruent trials(when it appeared in the opposite direction to the cue). The eyes, ahem, ‘hadit’ – as the authors of the paper pointed out.HERE’S LOOKING AT YOU, KIDFriesen and Kingstone’s cueing paradigm certainly offers a plausible explanationfor our innate perceptual bias for eyes. 34[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn34]But what does it tell us that wedon’t already know? 35 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn35]Back in thesixties, the social psychologist Stanley Milgram got a group of people togetheron a street corner. ‘Look up,’ he told them. What happened? Everyone else didthe same.9 And that’s not all. Whether the cueing hypothesis tells us the wholestory about eyes is also open to question. One thinks, for instance, of theprofound attentional deficits found in those with autism.Autistic infants prove the exception to the rule when it comes to focusing onthe eye region of faces, attending instead to the area around the mouth. As theyget older, autistic individuals also lack the ability to see, in both acognitive and an emotional sense, where others are ‘coming from’ – a deficitknown as an absence of a Theory of Mind. 36[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn36]Most children acquire therudiments of a Theory of Mind by around the age of four, as assessed by a nowclassic experiment called the Sally Anne Task:[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_018_r1.jpg]Figure 2.12 – The Sally Anne task. (photo credit 2.12)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c02-fig12a]Up until the age of four, children will invariably give the wrong answer to thisquestion: in the box. Because they happen to be familiar with the marble’s newlocation it’s inconceivable to them that others may not be. Eventually however,from about four onwards, the correct answer gradually begins to emerge as theneurological rumblings of self-awareness proceed to disentangle our own mindfrom those of others.Except, that is, in autism. From a clinical perspective, this is interesting. 37[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn37]Disorders of the autistic spectrumare the only ones in DSM IV (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of MentalDisorders, published by the American Psychological Association) specificallycharacterised by an absence of a Theory of Mind. In addition, they are also theonly disorders in which an inability to engage in eye contact presents as a keydiagnostic feature. Might it be that our innate perceptual bias for eyes, aswell as facilitating our propensity to detect threat, also foreshadows ourcapacity to ‘read’ people? To infer the mental states of others?Think, for a moment, of the potential long-term consequences that an inabilityto make eye contact might entail. If we lack the capacity to follow another’sgaze, to glean even the most basic units of information about what they may belooking at, how can we ever comprehend the notion that they may, in actual fact,possess a view different from our own? And if we cannot conceive of even thesemost fundamental gradations of autonomy, what hope do we have of ever fathomingthe subjective – the hopes and fears, the intentions and motivations, of others?EYE FOR INFLUENCEAttentional cueing and the conveying of mental state are two of the most commonexplanations put forward for our attraction to eyes, and they cover, betweenthem, a considerable amount of ground. Yet whether they cover all the ground isopen to question. Why, for instance, does engaging in eye contact renderpersuasion more effective? And why are our eyes, with their oceans of white andtiny marooned irises, so radically different – in appearance, at least – fromthose found anywhere else in the animal kingdom?The answers to these questions are rooted, I believe, in the state of totaldependency in which we first enter the world. Newborns, we know, possess aninnate perceptual bias for eyes. But could such a bias be a bit more complexthan it seems? Might it not be for the eyes themselves – but rather forsomething, well, a little more fundamental perhaps? For the perceptual contrastbetween light and dark that characterises their form? Could it be that whatwe’ve got going here is not, in actual fact, a unitary process at all but rathera two-tier model of influence? Where perceptual contrast engages the attentionof the newborn, and where the newborn ‘locks on’ with that vice-like grip ofcharm?To take this second point first – the charm factor – one need look no furtherthan the newborn itself. Not only are a newborn’s eyes disproportionately largein relation to its face (the face, unlike the eyes, continues to grow afterbirth), but the pupils, too, are similarly disproportionate in relation to thesclera (the white, outer surface of the eyeball – see Figure 2.13).This latter observation is believed to reflect the relative inefficiency of theimmature retina at capturing light. But research has also revealed that dilatedpupils can serve a completely different function: forging the bonds ofattraction.‘Which part of the human anatomy swells to twice its normal size when aroused?’the professor asks her class of first-year pre-meds.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_019_r1.jpg]Figure 2.13 – A baby’s face in superstimulus format. Note the oversized eyes andthe jumbo irises and pupils. (photo credit 2.13)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c02-fig13a]There’s an uncomfortable silence.‘Come on,’ she insists. ‘You must have some idea. Take a wild guess.’Still silence. Eventually, the sole male representative puts up his hand. Onlyfor the professor to wave it back down.‘Forget it,’ she says. ‘It’s the pupil!’This is an anecdote that routinely does the rounds among the medical fraternity,and which is particularly well known, perhaps not surprisingly, among the femalecontingent. But I have a sneaking suspicion that were our professor to haveposed her question to the women of sixteenth-century Italy, she might’ve gotmore than she bargained for. In Italy at that time it was customary for women toapply a few drops of the pigment belladonna – an extract of Deadly Nightshade –to their eyes in order to widen their pupils and make themselves more attractiveto potential suitors. They certainly knew what they were doing. But I doubt ifthey knew how it worked.When shown pictures of two identical faces, one with dilated pupils and theother without, and asked which of the two we rate as the more attractive, mostof us will choose the face with the dilated pupils (see Figure 2.14, below). Yetwhen asked to provide a specific reason for our choice, we just cannot seem tocome up with one. Intuitively, we feel that one face is ‘nicer’ than the other.More engaging, perhaps. Or friendly. But when it comes down to it – well, it’sanybody’s guess.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_020_r1.jpg]Figure 2.14 – If forced to make a choice, which of these two faces do you findthe more attractive? Most people ‘think’ it’s the one on the right. But, whenpressed, they are at a complete loss as to explain why. Now take a look at theeyes.In actual fact, the reason that we find faces with dilated pupils moreattractive than those without is down to reciprocity. Our pupils dilate whenaroused – when we encounter a stimulus that is either ‘easy on the eye’ or thatwe wish to learn more about. On occasions such as these we strive, quiteliterally, to let as much of them ‘in’ as we can. But not only do such pupilresponses occur automatically – outside of our conscious control – so does ourreceptivity to them in others. So, whenever we’re presented with a picture of aface with dilated pupils we unconsciously infer that the subject finds usattractive, and the law of reciprocity kicks in. We, in turn, find ourselvesmore attracted to them.This, incidentally, explains why we find dinner by candlelight a more romanticproposition than dinner in McDonald’s. (It’s one of the reasons anyway.) Underconditions of dim light, our pupils dilate to compensate for the reducedbrightness of our surroundings, to allow more of what little light there is onto our retinas. So now you know (just in case you were wondering) why in manyfast food outlets you practically need sunglasses to sit down and eat. It’sbecause the accent is on fast. No lingering glances over the fries!THERE IN BLACK AND WHITEThe eyes of the newborn seem custom-built to disarm. Their incongruousproportions and lagoons of latent empathy act as attention magnets – drawing usin to their sparkling, innocent depths. But what of the flip side of theequation: an innate bias for contrast that allows them not just to meet ourgaze, but to effortlessly lock on to it? Here, the evidence is similarlycompelling. 38 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn38]Studies have shownthat when newborns are presented with two figures side by side – one depicting adark circle within an oval (symbolic of an eye) and one a dark circle within asquare – there’s little to choose between them in terms of preference. However,when these two figures are presented, respectively, alongside an oval and asquare on their own – minus the embedded dark circles – a somewhat differentpicture emerges. A strong preference obtains for the former, more ‘eye-catching’stimuli.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_021_r1.jpg]Figure 2.15 – Infant preferences for shape and contrast combinations. (photocredit 2.15) [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c02-fig15a]Findings such as these seem to indicate that there’s nothing particularlyspecial about the eye itself that captures the attention of the newborn, butrather that it’s the ‘novelty’ of the stimulus – the perceptual contrastinherent to its appearance – that renders it unusually salient. And, moreover,that the greater this contrast is, the easier it is to delineate orientation.‘39 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn39]We have an uncanny ability,’says the American ethologist R. D. Guthrie, ‘to determine the exact position ofan individual’s stare even though he is on the other side of the room – merelyfrom judging the symmetrical alignment of a round pattern (iris) on a sphericalone (eyeball). Exposure of the white sclera aids considerably in that ability.[The sclera] allow the transmission of fairly precise signals from the eyes.’Which brings us, full circle, back to schematic faces and eye gaze. And theadaptive benefits of ocularly cued attention.So could a talent for split-second persuasion explain the newborn’s soft spotfor eyes: the same as it does their crying and their cutie-pie good looks? Do wehave, in the newborn, persuasion in its purest form? A primordial ability to getthe point across: ‘I am vulnerable. I am helpless. And you – yes, YOU! – need todo something about it?’From the evidence put forward in this chapter, it could certainly be argued thatway. Both the soundtrack and screenplay of neonatal behaviour have beeningeniously choreographed, under the direction of natural selection, with onesimple aim in mind: the immediate induction of nurturance and protection.Simplicity and empathy, so integral to the key stimuli of animal persuasion, arepresent in babies too. The crying of a newborn, together with their looks,constitutes a primeval prototype, 100% proof, of persuasion. And note, too, howperceptual incongruity plays its part: with looks, those wide, over-sized eyes;with crying, those sudden, dramatic, unscripted shifts in pitch.The moment we’re born we’re at our most vulnerable. Yet we’re also, by exquisiteevolutionary design, at the height of our persuasive powers.Daryl, the South London hoodlum we met at the beginning of this chapter,certainly wouldn’t argue. Were it not for an encounter with one of the world’sgreatest persuaders, the kind of bars he’d be used to by now wouldn’t be dishingout mocha frappuccinos.They’d be serving up porridge instead.SUMMARYIn this chapter, we’ve continued our exploration of the biological basis ofinfluence by looking at the extraordinary persuasive power of infants. Newbornbabies come into this world with just two simple aims – security and nurturance– and an overwhelming incentive to achieve them. Yet newborns travel light.Lacking the neural technology for sophisticated communication, they appearspectacularly under-prepared for the challenge that lies ahead of them. How,without language, have they any hope of survival?The answer, just as with animals, lies in key stimuli. An irresistible cry, afundamental propensity to make eye contact, and an effortless cuteness, allconverge into a psychological laser beam of influence: a beam that’s traineddirectly on our brain’s reward systems. There’s not a schmoozer in history whocould ever compete with an infant. We’re never more persuasive than on our veryfirst day on earth.In the next chapter [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c03_r1.htm], we twiddle thespotlight in a slightly different direction. While sticking with the theme ofimmediate, incisive influence, we shift our attention to another kind of keystimulus – a kind that impacts not on ancient, sub-cortical reward systems buton cognitive process: the way our brains evaluate the world.When it comes, as we’ve seen, to persuasion, animals and infants have twodistinct advantages over the rest of us. First, they cannot think. Second, theycannot speak. But cognition and language have their own expressways of influence– and they’re just as fast as any that went before.We can, as we’ll see, learn to be persuaded.Question: Which type of crime are you more likely to be found guilty of ifyou’re good-looking?Answer: Crimes involving deception and fraud. It’s precisely on account of thehalo effect that good looks constitute one of the confidence trickster’s mostpowerful weapons.1 Using the same technology, Stapleton has also come up with the ‘silentringtone’ – a phone audible to teens but not to their teachers. That should makelessons more interesting.2 Around 2,500–5,500Hz, with temporal modulations in the region of 1–16Hz.3 fMRI, or functional magnetic resonance imaging, is a technique measuringblood-oxygen levels in the brain, thereby allowing researchers to determinewhich areas are most active at any given time.4 12 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn12]Such findings may beexplained by something known as the halo effect: the presence of one or twodiscrete positive traits – including physical attractiveness – which invoke, inturn, a generic aura of goodness, expertise, honesty, or some other inferredsuperlative. Interestingly, it’s not the case for all crimes that good-lookingdefendants are less likely to be found guilty. There is, in fact, one type ofcrime where the likelihood is actually greater. Can you think what that kind ofcrime might be? The answer is given at the end of the chapter.5 14 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c02-ftn14]Just in case you werewondering, it works the other way round as well. Susan Andersen at New YorkUniversity and Sandra Bem at Cornell University manipulated the role-playingscenario so that the participants were female and the bogus fellow student wasmale. It made no difference.5 This scale ranged from baby-facedness (associated strongly withtrustworthiness and weakly with expertise) on the one hand, to mature-facedness(associated strongly with expertise) on the other.6 Ever wondered why women ‘make up’ their eyebrows in a higher position thanthey would otherwise appear naturally? Now you know.7 Both the Coastguard and the Beachy Head Chaplaincy Team have allegedly accusedKeith of not having the proper training to save lives, thereby placing his ownlife and, ironically, that of the person he’s trying to save, in greater danger.Keith’s response is pragmatic. ‘Every second counts,’ he says. ‘When you’re inthe business of saving lives, you often don’t have the time to call for help.You have to act.’8 It’s also an integral component of empathy – establishing rapport with others.One example of this can be found in military settings. Peacekeeping forces inIraq, for instance, whose members wear sunglasses, report higher incidences ofunrest, and incur more casualties, than those whose members keep their eyesvisible.9 Milgram also found that the degree of conformity varied with the size of thegroup. When it was only the one person gazing skywards, the proportion ofpassers-by who imitated them stood at 40 per cent. This rose to 60 per cent forthree individuals, 75 per cent for ten, and 80 per cent for fifteen."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3MIND THEFT AUTOA man sets off on a fishing trip with his fishing rod in one hand and a suitcasein the other. Just as he’s about to board his plane, he’s stopped by one of thestewards. ‘How long is your fishing rod?’ the steward asks. ‘Five feet,’ repliesthe man. ‘I’m sorry sir,’ says the steward, ‘but we can’t allow anything longerthan four feet on this flight. Can you fold it?’ ‘No,’ says the man. ‘Then I’mafraid you’ll have to leave the rod behind,’ says the steward. The man isfurious. What good is a fishing trip without a fishing rod? he thinks. But,then, just as he’s resigned to having to cancel the trip, he has an idea. A fewminutes later both he, and his fishing rod, are safely aboard the flight. Howdoes he solve the problem?FISHER OF MENThere’s more to the brilliance of the streetwise, psychopathic hustler than justconfidence, charm and looks (though none of them do any harm). Don’t believe me?Then meet Keith Barrett.For most of the eighties and the early part of the nineties, Barrett was aserial conman. He was shit hot at it, too. He was a master of the ‘long con’ –elaborate and sophisticated stings usually, though not exclusively, confined tothe corporate sector and involving large sums of money. Then one day, his numbercame up. One scam too many – city job, complex, worth a million, maybe more –necessitated he take an enforced sabbatical from his work. And when he came outfive years later, having had an affair with the prison psychologist, he saw theworld differently. He’d, ahem, found God.Ever since he was at school, Barrett had always been good at getting people todo things. He regarded himself as a scientist, and the human mind hislaboratory. And most of the formulas contained within psychology textbooks he’dmanaged to derive for himself. From first principles.He was, you could say, a persuasion prodigy.So it was little surprise that six months after joining his local church, thecongregation had swelled to an unprecedented level and the ecstatic, if somewhatbemused, young minister was seriously considering locating to new premises. Forwhich, thanks to Barrett, there were ample funds in the coffers. It wasn’t somuch a case of Barrett finding God, the minister enthused at the time. More ofGod finding him.For Barrett, the reality was somewhat different. Far from the churchconstituting a new start, it merely presented a new window of opportunity. A newset of apparatus on which to try out the old experiments.‘Persuasion was, and still is, an addiction,’ he says. ‘I’ve got a cheatingdisorder. I get a high from getting people to do things that they otherwisemight not. And the greater the amount of resistance I have to overcome toachieve that, the better it feels. Everyone shuts the door on Bible-bashers,right? So I thought to myself: I’m good at what I do. One of the best in thebusiness. I’ve got a gift. A gift from God – who knows? It’s just that in thepast I’ve used that gift for my own ends. So why not do some good with it foronce?’He smiles.‘Or that’s what I told the minister anyway. That pompous prick would haveswallowed anything if it made him look good in front of his flock!’Barrett’s technique was unorthodox to say the least. It was also downrightillegal. Jettisoning the sumptuous haute couture of the old days – the silkties, the Gucci shoes, the Armani shirts, and the £2000 Savile Row suits – hebegan by dressing down. In jeans, sneakers and sport’s shirt: the epitome ofshabby chic. Such a retrograde costume change as this (made, he points outimpishly, against all his natural sartorial instincts) flags up theextraordinary attention to detail, the predatory, arctic acumen of the ultimatepersuasion virtuoso.Here’s Vic Sloan, another conman I spoke to, whose views on appropriate attireimplicate colour as well as style, and the hidden persuasive properties of aworkaday pink shirt:‘The brain responds well to pink,’ he elucidates. ‘It’s a scientific fact. Pinkis a tranquillising colour. It produces a pattern of brain waves like no other.It stems from our evolution. Ancient man would have seen pink in the sky atsunset and sunrise – at which times, given the ambient light and circadianrhythms, it would have become associated with sleep and relaxation. So if you’retrying to keep things on an even keel, pink is a good colour to have around.’1 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn1]Sloan, in fact, might well be onto something here. The success of a particular hue of pink – Baker-Miller pink,or, as it’s more commonly known, ‘drunk-tank’ pink – in calming the mood ofviolent offenders has been scientifically documented in a number of US studies.Reductions in anxiety levels, as well as in systolic and diastolic bloodpressure, have all been reported in detainees held in rooms painted this colour,in both civil and military detention centres.1 In fact, following an experimentat the University of Iowa in which the locker-rooms of visiting sports teamswere daubed Baker-Miller pink so as to render their players less competitive,the Western Athletic Conference duly passed a law expressly prohibiting anyfurther such forays into locker-room interior design. The edict couldn’t havebeen clearer. In future, it stated, the locker-rooms of both the home and thevisiting team could be painted any damn colour under the sun. So long as theywere the same.But I digress. Having sorted out his wardrobe, Barrett – suitably attired –would get down to business. And he would do so by deploying a technique that hedescribes as working the ‘Three As’ of social influence: attention, approach,and affiliation. Such a cocktail, according to Barrett, ships so much psychologyinto the brain’s bloodstream that recipients lose all resistance to persuasion.It’s the compliance equivalent of rohypnol. And it was all so easy.Systematically targeting a pre-selected group of wealthy neighbourhoods, Barrett– over a period of, say, six weeks – would gain covert entry to residents’ cars.Then, once he’d turned on the sidelights, he would roll out the ‘good neighbour’trick of knocking on doors and informing them of their ‘oversight’. Havingengaged his quarry in conversation (like most of his species, Barrett could sellshaving foam to the Taliban), he would contrive to explain why he just ‘happenedto be passing’, and request, perhaps, a small donation. Which, nine times out often, would be forthcoming. The request was perfectly timed so that it was made –nonchalantly – just when Barrett was walking away from his target. Furtherattention to detail.‘If they have to call you back, actually have to be proactive and ask you tostop on purpose,’ he explains, ‘without knowing it they’ve made a greatercommitment than if you’re just standing there passively waiting for them to giveyou something.’Some time later residents would notice the ad, for the church, which Barrett hadpersuaded the minister to place in the local paper. The laws of psychology thentook care of the rest. The fact that they’d made a previous donation had educedin residents a token commitment to the church. And – what the hell – some ofthem actually went along to take a look at it. Not all of them, mind you. Butsome of them. More than would have done so had they just seen the ad and notmade a donation.And that, as they say, was that. Simple. Like taking candy from a baby. Thechurch was packed to the rafters and Barrett had taken his cut.The Good Lord works in mysterious ways, all right. And they don’t, let me tellyou, come any more mysterious than Keith Barrett.THE RIGHT LINESKeith Barrett is an evil, unfathomable genius. He’s a psychopath. Anevolutionary double-agent. A predatory mind-hacker who has made it his life’swork to intercept and decode the psychological DNA of free will. The lightswitches of his brain are wired up in a different way from the rest of ours, andhis neural meteorology is unpredictable. Yet Keith Barrett has something goingon. He is, as well as being a ruthless, ice-cool hustler, one of the very bestpersuaders in the business. And what works for the psychopathic conman can alsowork for the rest of us.I’ve been studying the principles of social influence for over 15 years now.During that time I’ve come across a number of taxonomies that, likepsychological string theory, purport to have reduced the science of persuasionto something you can slap on a T-shirt. Some of them, it has to be said, arebetter than others. But you want to know something? Barrett’s Three As –attention, approach and affiliation – are up there with the best of them, andprovide the empirical backdrop to my own model of influence which we’llencounter a little bit later.‘Look at it this way,’ says Barrett. ‘You know those cartoons of famous peopleyou get in the newspaper? You can recognise who it is pretty much from nothing,the bare minimum of detail. Just a few key lines in the right place – but theyhave to be in the right place – and it’s, like, “Hey yeah, I got it!” Same withpersuasion. You’ve just got to know where the brain’s pressure points are. Wherepeople’s psychological blind spots are.’He is, of course, right about the cartoons. Take the example below.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_022_r1.jpg]Figure 3.1 – The economy of art: a few simple pen strokes speak volumes. (photocredit 3.1) [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c03-fig1a]We all know who it is, right? But just look at how much information is conveyedby so few elements. How an individual’s entire physiognomy may be compressedinto a few strategic squiggles. Exactly as Barrett said, it’s not so much a caseof how much detail you lay down. More how you lay it down.He’s right about pressure points, too. And in the pages that follow we shall belooking at one or two of them. We shall decode the secrets of his shadowy streetpsychology. And, using his Three As as a guide, get a conman’s view of how thebrain can be brought to its knees.ATTENTIONDuring the course of any one moment, thousands of stimuli from the externalenvironment come flooding into our brains. Yet we’re only aware of – we only payattention to – a handful. Consider what you are doing right now, for instance,reading this book. As your eyes move over the text, you’re aware of the wordsand the pages on which they are printed, but probably not – until I mention it –the way the book feels in your hand. The reason for this is simple. The brainhas a bureau that prioritises information. And only information that’s importantto what we are doing – that’s salient at the time – is allowed to filterthrough. The rest ends up in the shredder.The fact that there are ways to hack into the brain’s information bureau – andto rig what ends up in its in-tray – has been known since ancient times. Inhypnosis, for example, the ability of the hypnotist to twiddle the knobs ofconsciousness, to orient it, like some neuropsychological satellite dish, isintegral to the induction of trance. In magic, too, the attentional bypass iscommon.But cognitive distraction is also a part of persuasion. Here, as in magic, thepower lies in misdirection – only linguistic rather than physical. The skilledpersuader, just like the master conjuror, is also adept at controlling ‘where welook’. And, more importantly, where we think. In fact, sometimes (rememberDrayton Doherty and the lizard?) the line between magic and persuasion isactually quite tricky to draw.A FOOL AND HIS MONEYThree housemates walk into an electrical store intent on buying a cheap,second-hand television for their front room. They see one that they like and askthe shopkeeper how much it costs. The shopkeeper tells them that it costs £25and they decide to split the cost equally. Each housemate hands over a £10 noteand the shopkeeper goes to the back of the shop, where he keeps the cashregister, to fetch them their change.But as he does so he has an idea. Actually, he thinks to himself, if I tell themthat I screwed up and the television costs £27, I can cream off some extraprofit and no one will be any the wiser. And so this is what the shopkeeperdoes. He deposits the three £10 notes in the cash register and takes out five £1coins, two of which he puts in his pocket. He then informs the three housematesthat he’s made a mistake on the price – the television cost £27, and not, ashe’d originally told them, £25 – and hands each of them back £1.The three housemates leave the shop quite satisfied – the television, after all,is still a hell of a bargain – and the shopkeeper is delighted with himself forhaving diddled them out of an extra couple of quid. Everyone’s a winner.But hang on a moment – there’s a problem here surely? Let’s run through itagain.The three housemates handed the shopkeeper £30 and the shopkeeper returned tothem with five £1 coins from the till. Palming two for himself, and giving eachof them back £1, means that each of the housemates has paid how much again forthe television? Correct – £9.3 × £9 = £27 + £2 = £29.Suddenly, we’ve got a pound missing.So runs a notoriously tricky, yet fiendishly simple, problem. Many people – yes,myself included – have been floored by this dodgy psycho-arithmetic. But why?Why do so many of us slip up over the simplest of things? The answer to thisquestion is sobering to say the least. The reason that we so often come unstuckover problems like this is because we have what we might call a ‘preparedness’to be deceived: a seriously impressive talent for being conned.The way it works is like this. During the course of our evolutionary history,our brains, through the repeated assimilation of millions upon millions ofmicroscopic slivers of information, have learned to take shortcuts. To use rulesof thumb rather than work every single problem out from scratch. They have, tocoin a phrase, ‘seen it all before’. We make inferences about the world. Formexpectations. Convert, to transpose La Place’s famous observation, calculus tocommon sense. And on the basis of such expectations, we’re vulnerable to sleightof mind.‘Life,’ said the writer Kurt Vonnegut, ‘happens too fast for you ever to thinkabout it.’Natural selection agrees with him.The efficacy of the missing pound problem is down to what Keith Barrett wouldcall a ‘virus’ of attention. Our brain is bamboozled into looking somewhere itshouldn’t. Then – bam! – just like hypnosis, the unbelievable happens rightunder our nose. And there’s plenty more where that came from.2 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn2]Take, for example, the twophotographs of Margaret Thatcher in Figure 3.2 below.

In everydaylanguage mental set roughly translates as ‘frame of mind’ and refers to thestate of ‘auto-pilot’ in which we, more often than we care to realise, go aboutour business.In trems of the way in wchih we prcoess lagnguage, for istnance, scuh a sttae ofatuo-piolt revleas the paomnnehal pweor of the hmuan mnid.

Armed with the knowledge that seemingly all of us detestboth queue-barging and photocopying (alongside incest and murder, I wouldn’t beat all surprised if anthropologists shortly announce the existence of twofurther universal taboos), Langer contrived two different varieties of excusespecifically designed to enable an associate to jump to the front of a photocopyline. The first of these excuses amounted to the fact that the individual inquestion was in a terrible hurry and only had one sheet to copy: standard, buteffective, bollocks. The second constituted the following: Please can I use thephotocopier first because I need to use the photocopier?Incredibly, it turned out that this latter crock of shit proved to be just aseffective as the first: definitive proof that reasons, under some circumstances,are processed in exactly the same way as fucntion words like ‘of’. So long asthey exist, we don’t, in many cases, need to delve any further into the natureof their composition. They are present – peripherally so – and that’s enough.They are, in short, an inviolable part of the syntax of everyday life. (Spot thetypo? Go back five lines.)BRIDE AND VROOMAttentional viruses like mental set are something that all of us are susceptibleto from time to time. And not just when we’re waiting for the photocopier. As wesaw a bit earlier with the Fs and the 9s, there are occasions in life when ourbrains get delusions of grandeur – when they make up their minds before we do!Jim and Ellie Ritchie found out the hard way about mental set. Midway throughtheir wedding reception at a posh hotel in Scotland, the best man suddenlydiscovered that the presents weren’t where he’d left them. After discreetlymaking enquiries among the staff, a girl on reception finally cleared things up.An hour or so earlier there’d been a couple of guys and a truck. The guys hadbeen wearing uniforms and had flashed a piece of paper. Don’t worry, they’dsaid, it had all been arranged. Then they’d loaded up the truck and buggeredoff.‘Arranged?’ asked the best man. ‘What do you mean, arranged?’ The receptioniststarted to panic. ‘Arranged,’ she said. ‘The presents. They were all going backto the house.’ ‘What house?’ asked the best man. ‘Er, I don’t know,’ said thereceptionist. ‘I thought … maybe …’ She burst into tears. ‘The groom’s?’ Ohfuck, thought the best man. The happy couple lived over 700 miles away.Later, it all came out. The receptionist, it transpired, hadn’t checked themen’s ID. At the exact same time that the blaggers had sauntered in she’d beendeep in conversation with the guy in 308. Some problem with room service, shesaid. She’d simply waved them through. Besides, she pointed out, why would shehave suspected them? They looked the part. They acted the part. They were thepart. Weren’t they?Sadly for Jim and Ellie – no, they weren’t. And neither was the guy in 308. Theroom, it turned out, had been booked in the name of Smith. But at the time thatSmith had been complaining about the bellboy, it was, you guessed it, empty.Smith had actually still to show. In fact, he never did.Distraction crimes like this are bread and butter to your average conman. Youdon’t even need to be good. When I told him about it, Keith Barrett laughed.This lot, he reckoned, would have been scouring the local papers – specificallyon the lookout for weddings just like Jim and Ellie’s. And then just taken theirchances. Nothing personal, you understand. Strictly business. You only need tolook the part. Have a bit of confidence. And rely on the brain’s unfailingcapacity to jump to conclusions. All in a dishonest day’s work.(Want a demonstration of how – just like our receptionist – not paying attentionmakes us jump to conclusions? Have a go at the exercise at the end of thechapter on this page.)But perhaps, on second thoughts, we shouldn’t be giving the receptionist toohard a time. It wasn’t her, after all, who ran off with the presents. In fact,if we’re in the business of pointing fingers, the true architect of the heist isactually that shyster Smith – the elusive mystery guest in Room 308. Smith actsas an attention conductor: a concentration magnet who diverts all of thereceptionist’s available psychological resources away from the real problem andinto a nonexistent one – in much the same way, for instance, that a bogusmaintenance man might flash a fake ID, and then, immediately afterwards, orbetter still simultaneously, initiate conversation. Maybe your hair looks good.Or the car out front is cool. Next thing you know you’re in debt. And thecredit-card people are calling. Words, especially nice ones, make excellentcognitive circuit breakers.WHEEL OF FORTUNEThe effects of distraction on our ability to make decisions illustrates our needto stay vigilant under pressure. To check that maintenance guy’s ID. To verifyhis details. Cognitive resources are just like any other kind of resource. Theyare limited. And this, obviously, has implications for the way we allocate them.Ever wondered, when you read about them in newspapers or hear about them on TV,why many of the world’s greatest conmen are also, more often than not, theworld’s greatest charmers? There’s a reason for it. Basking in sweet talkdoesn’t come cheap. It’s an expensive brain state to maintain, and constitutes afar greater cognitive load – places far higher demands on our limited cognitivefunds – than does its opposite number: reality checking. Which means, in turn,that when we’re lapping up the compliments we’re eating up the assets. Brainassets. So there’s less to invest in the business of critical thinking.4 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn4]The principle of ‘cognitive load’– that the more operations our brain has to perform at any one time, the greaterthe drain on available resources – may be illustrated by a simple attentiontask, shown opposite. First, cover up both figures below with a blank sheet ofpaper. Then, when you have done so, uncover the figure on the left and locatethe bold ‘X’ within the display. Now uncover the figure on the right and do thesame.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_025_r1.jpg]Figure 3.4a and 3.4b – X marks the spot. (photo credit 3.4)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c03-fig4a]Did you find it easier to find the bold X the first or the second time round? Ibet it was the first time. And the reason? In the second display, the demands onthe brain’s attentional resources are double what they are in the first. In thefirst, the brain only has to discriminate between contrast. In the second,between contrast and shape.Yet cognitive load can also work in our favour. Ironically (given that it’s afavourite device of conmen), putting the brain under a bit of pressure –increasing the amount of work that it has to do – can also be useful if we wantto turn the tables: find out if someone is lying. Which, when you think aboutit, actually makes perfect sense. The more you give someone to mull over, thefewer resources their brain has available to help conceal the truth. In fact, inpolice inter – views and military interrogation, this is standard practice.Tried and tested techniques such as the exchange of ‘knowing’ looks betweenofficers; close physical proximity; robust handling; positioning of detaineesaway from so-called ‘control triggers’ such as light-switches and door handles;officers being called out of the room on the pretext of ‘new information’ comingto light; ‘incriminating evidence’ (sometimes just blank sheets) being placedfacedown on the table; and dossiers with everything but the suspect’s nameobscured are all, on timely introduction, powerful conduits of ‘diversionary’persuasion.Just so you know. For next time.APPROACHNo two people see exactly alike. That’s what the old empiricists used to tellus, and they’re right. Low-level differences in perceptual awareness do existbetween individuals. On the other hand, however, when it comes to the way we seethe world in general, we have a lot more in common than we think.Consider, for example, the following. Imagine that someone hands in theirlottery ticket bearing the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Which of these twoscenarios would cause you greater amusement:If the winning sequence turned out to be 4, 14, 22, 33, 40, and 45?Or if it was 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12?Nearly everyone says the latter (unless it was their ticket). But why? In actualfact, the probability of the winning ticket bearing either of these sequences isthe same.Take another example. Imagine you’re at a raffle and the winning number is 672.When would you feel harder done by? If you had 671? Or, alternatively, 389?These two instances reveal something rather interesting about our brains. Theyare slothful creatures of habit. Rather than preparing decisions from scratchusing fresh, seasonal ingredients, they prefer the ready-made variety –chock-full of conjecture, assumption and pre-packaged, freeze-dried reasoning.Such information, in the wrong hands, can be dangerous. In sport, reading one’sopponent, knowing what makes them tick, knowing how they’re likely to approach agiven play, is the goal of every competitor.It’s exactly the same in persuasion.TALL STORY5 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn5]Imagine that you’re working for amarketing company and you’re processing a series of surveys completed by arandom sample of adult men in the United States. One of the respondents, who hasput his height down as over 6′5″, has been less than precise when it comes tothe question about employment. It’s not clear whether he has put a cross by‘bank manager’ or by the item next on the list: ‘basketball player’. It’s up toyou to make the decision for him. Which profession are you going to go for?If you chose ‘basketball player’ – congratulations! You share your answer with78 per cent of first-year undergraduates at the University of Cambridge.Unfortunately, however – just like them – you’re wrong.Let me start by asking you this. In the general population of the United States,who do you think there are more of – professional basketball players or bankmanagers? The answer, I think you’ll agree, is bank managers. Let’s put anarbitrary figure on each. Let’s say there are 300 basketball pros and 15,000bank managers.OK, now out of those 300 basketball pros, how many do you think are over 6′5″?60 per cent? 70 per cent? Let’s say 70. Which means, by my calculations, thatthere are 210 professional basketball players in the US who are over 6′5″.Now let’s take the bank managers. Out of those 15,000, how many of them do youthink are over 6′5″? On this occasion, let’s go for a conservative estimate andsay 2 per cent.Yet even if only 2 per cent of bank managers are taller than 6′5″, that stillaccounts for 300 people – which means that there are 90 more bank managers over6′5″ than there are basketball players.Oh, dear.What’s just happened here with the basketball player and the bank managerintroduces the second of Keith Barrett’s key ingredients of influence –approach. Approach, in Barrett’s system, refers to our attitudes and beliefsabout the world. Or, more specifically, how these attitudes and beliefs impacton the kinds of decisions we make. The reason that we perform so poorly on taskssuch as this is actually quite simple. It has to do with the way our brainprocesses information about the world. The way it files its paperwork.In the example above, the brain is required to solve a mystery. Its detectiveskills are called upon. The ‘crime’ is being over 6′5″ tall, and there are two‘suspects’ – the bank manager and the basketball player. In light of thisinitial information, the brain runs a preliminary check on its database – ‘Justroutine, sir’ – and in so doing something rather interesting pops up on screen.The basketball player has a number of ‘previous convictions’ for exactly such acrime. There is, in contrast, no record of the bank manager whatsoever. So,faced with such ‘evidence’ as this, what does the brain do? Well, like anyseasoned detective, it hauls the basketball player in for questioning anddecides not to bother the bank manager.The analogy of the brain as forensic database is not one that you’re likely tocome across too often in the pages of psychology texts. And there are probably,somewhere, some very good reasons for that. But for present purposes, it fitsrather well. For, just like such a system, our brain profiles incominginformation according to perceived probabilities and known associates. Itengages in speed reasoning. Or, as they say in the trade, it uses heuristics.In the category of height, for instance, 6′5″ or over is a ‘known associate’ ofthe basketball player. As such, it seems far more likely that the two of themwill be working together than it does that 6′5″ and the bank manager will be inpartnership. In the more orthodox language of cognitive psychology, we form, onthe basis of previous experience, a schema or an associative network ofbasketball players and bank managers – a general concept of ‘who they are’ – andthese schemas are underwritten by certain ultra-salient descriptives such as‘tall’ or ‘wears a collar and tie’. Once such exemplars are entered into thesystem, those on file who ‘match the description’ are flagged up as deserving ofcloser scrutiny. Yet sometimes, as we’ve just seen, the real culprits slipthrough the net.MAGIC SQUARE6 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn6]Heuristics are pretty muchindispensable during the course of everyday life. They’re the corticalequivalent of the fixed action patterns that we saw in animals in Chapter 1[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c01_r1.htm] – short, sharp bursts of automaticbehaviour, triggered by the presence of a key stimulus. They provide smooth,underground slip-roads through the middle of rush-hour consciousness that enablethe brain to shoot across town in a hurry. But these slip-roads are dangerous.And conmen like Keith Barrett know them like the back of their hands. They arefast. They are dark. And they are covered in psychological black ice. Andaccidents, as we’ve just seen, are commonplace.‘The brain,’ says Barrett, ‘is like a Snakes and Ladders board. You can go thelong way round and pass through every number. Or you can hit the ladder on ninethat takes you up to ninety-nine.’It’s a ladder he’s been up a lot.From an evolutionary perspective, there’s no way around any of this. With thepossible exception of some of the new self-serve check-in contraptions they’veinstalled at Heathrow airport, the human brain is the most complex piece ofmachinery we are ever likely to see. Yet we’re still hardwired to be fall guys.Bizarrely, taking everything into consideration, there is method in thismadness. Irrespective of how brilliant our brains may happen to be, we cannotdouble-check every single thing that occurs to us on the basis of veracity. Lifeis, quite literally, too short. Instead, rather like a physician diagnosing anillness (or a detective solving a crime), we must rely on ‘tried and tested’presenting symptoms – on super-informative key stimuli – to guide our behaviour.Not spots like the Herring Gull. Or quonks like the Louisiana Bell Frogs. Butrather the deep, accumulated wisdom of learned associations. And sometimes,because of our brain’s unfortunate penchant for short cuts, we get the answerwrong.GRAPE EXPECTATIONSWhat happened earlier with the bank manager and basketball player is known inpsychology as the representativeness heuristic: a rule of thumb by which ourbrains make inferences about the probability of a hypothesis by considering itsfit with data already available. And, trust me, it doesn’t just happen whenwe’re sitting down filling out forms.7 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn7]In a study which looked at theeffects of expectation on taste, Hilke Plassman and her colleagues at theCalifornia Institute of Technology sneakily switched the price tags on amiddling bottle of cabernet. Some volunteers were told that the bottle was worth$10. Others were told it was $90. Did this difference in price make a differenceto how the wine tasted?You bet it did.Participants who were told that the bottle was worth $90 pronounced it a farbetter wine than those who thought it was worth $10.And that wasn’t all. Subsequently, under fMRI conditions, Plassman found thatthis simple sleight of mind was actually reflected anatomically – in neuralactivity deep within the brain. Not only did the ‘cheaper’ wine taste cheaperand the ‘dearer’ one, well, dearer – the latter also excited the medialorbitofrontal cortex, the part of the brain that responds to pleasurableexperiences.8 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn8]Similar results have also beenfound with experts. Cognitive psychologist Frederic Brochet of the GeneralOenology Laboratory in France took a mid-range Bordeaux and served it in twodifferent bottles. One was a kick-ass grand cru. The other a vin de table.Would the bottles have an impact on the connoisseurs’ rarefied palates? Or wouldthe wine buffs smell a rat?Not a chance.Despite the fact, just as in the Plassman study, that they were actually beingserved the same vintage, the experts appraised the differentbottles … differently. The grand cru was described as ‘agreeable, woody,complex, balanced and rounded’ – while the vin de table, in contrast, wasevaluated less salubriously: as ‘weak, short, light, flat and faulty’.9 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn9]John Darley and Paul Gross atPrinceton University have taken things one stage further and demonstrated thiseffect in a study on social class. In their take on the paradigm, participantsevaluated the performance of a child as she worked on a series of mathsproblems. The participants were divided into two groups. One group were toldthat the child came from a low socio-economic background, while the other weretold the opposite: that she was of high socioeconomic status (SES).Who do you think rated the child as more intelligent? Correct – those who weretold that she was of high socioeconomic status. Moreover, this simple beliefbias went way beyond just maths – it was sufficient to account for judgements ofgeneral intelligence. Those who believed the child to be of low SES rated herperformance as below average, while those who believed her to be of high SESrated it as above. Socio-economic status – in wine, in people, in anything –constitutes a key stimulus of approach. And colours our perception more than wecare to realise.2SOMETHING IN MINDExpectations, of course, don’t just have an impact on perceptions ofperformance. They can affect performance itself. Take academia, for example. Onsitting the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) in the States, black volunteersperform significantly worse if they’re told, prior to testing, that the examsare indicative of a person’s level of intelligence. Findings such as these,where notions of inferiority concerning a group to which we belong cansignificantly affect our ability as individuals, reflect what is known as‘stereotype threat’ – ‘stereotype lift’, in contrast, describes the opposite:when a sense of in-group superiority actually facilitates performance.10 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn10]Margaret Shih at Harvard hasdemonstrated this empirically. In a study which looked at women from Asianbackgrounds, Shih found that when the women were primed to think of themselvesas ‘women’ they performed worse on maths tests than men – thereby confirming thefamiliar ‘male/ female brain’ stereotype. Conversely, however, when they thoughtof themselves as ‘Asian’ they actually performed better than men – Asians,stereotypically, enjoying generally higher maths cred than other ethnic groups.11 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn11]Jeff Stone, at the Universityof Arizona, reports similar findings in sport. When golf is presented as a testof athletic ability, black golfers outperform whites. But when the game isdepicted as a showcase of cognitive strategy, the trend mysteriously reverses:whites do better than blacks. Race, like socioeconomic status, is another keystimulus of approach.Related to the concept of representativeness is that of availability. Ifrepresentativeness refers to the way our brains make probabilistic inferencesabout the relationships between variables (e.g. occupation and height;socioeconomic status and academic ability), availability describes a more‘temporal’ kind of inference: our tendency to confuse how frequently an eventoccurs with the ease with which examples of it may be brought to mind.12 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn12]To illustrate, consider thefollowing cheery pronouncements:More people die from firearms than from asthma.More people die from cancer than from a stroke.More people die in accidents than from emphysema.More people die from homicides than from floods.How many of these estimates do you agree with? Might it be all of them by anychance? If it is then you’re in good company. Most people think the same. Butactually, you’re in for a surprise. All of these estimates are wrong. Some ofthem by miles. Now ask yourself this. Of the kinds of fatality just described,which do you hear most about? Which are the most ‘available’ in your memory?13 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn13]It’s difficult to convey thepower of the availability heuristic without a concrete example. So let’s take alook at one right now. Below is a list of names. Read them over carefully, andthen as soon as you’ve done so cover them up with a sheet of paper:[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_026_r1.jpg]OK. Now that you’ve read the names try to recall as many of them as you can.Then estimate whether there were more women on the list, or men.Only when you’ve made your estimate should you read on …Made your estimate? Great – what was it? More women than men by any chance?That’s fine, it’s what most people say. But now take another look at the list.Count up the names. Funny, huh? The sex ratio is exactly the same. There areprecisely as many men on the list as there are women. But notice anything else –how the women are more famous, perhaps?Here’s another example. Give yourself 60 seconds to come up with as many wordsas you can that conform to the pattern: – – – – – n –. When you’ve finished,repeat the test only this time with the pattern: – – – –ing.Chances are you came up with more words the second time round than the firsttime, right? But actually, you shouldn’t have. Take a closer look and you’llnotice that the first example is, in fact, identical to the second. Only withthe letters ‘i’ and ‘g’ blanked out. Which means that any word that conforms tothe second example must automatically conform to the first. Which means – that’sright – that words fitting the first template are actually more common.But words that fit the second template more easily spring to mind.SOFT TOUCHOur hardwired propensity to jump to conclusions, to respond, completelyinstinctively, to what we might refer to as ‘conceptual’ key stimuli –constructs containing high levels of representativeness and availability, forinstance – provides easy pickings for the sharks of social influence. And, ofcourse, for the rest of us. As Keith Barrett somewhat chillingly points out, ifyou know where the ladders are and can handle a dice, the game – and for theseguys it is a game – is over pretty quickly.Take Shaffiq Khan, for example. Khan, like Barrett, is another super-smoothpsychopath. But Khan, unlike Barrett, concentrates his killer persuasionpredominantly on individuals rather than on large corporations. Khan’smotivation is the high life. ‘There’s no level of luxury to which I cannotaspire,’ he tells me over lunch in a chic London restaurant. From the look ofhim – Rolex, Porsche, Armani – it’s difficult to disagree.Khan’s modus operandi is disarmingly simple. He criss-crosses the globe as aglamorous entrepreneur (which, in a way, I guess he is), exhibiting a ruthlessdedication to the art of looking good. He stays in the smartest hotels.Frequents the hippest bars. And he always flies first class. It’s here, in theworld’s most exclusive hangouts, that he plies his deadly trade: charming, andthen seducing, sometimes female staff members, sometimes fellow clients, whom hesubsequently cleans out.Khan is coy about his seduction techniques. But he offers the following insight:‘Touch is important – physical contact. You see it in primates as they groomeach other. It’s a method of ingratiation. You scratch my back, I’ll scratchyours. Now with humans, ingratiation is usually something that people of lowerstatus do to people higher than them.3 Again, exactly like in primates. It’shardwired into us from evolution. They’ll try to build bridges, store up favoursby being tactile. So our brains are programmed to expect lower-status people tobe more touchy-feely. Reverse that expectation – which is what I do: I alwaysinitiate contact with a gentle touch of the arm or on the small of the back –and it’s very powerful. It says: you are of value to me, rather than the otherway round. And they think – why would I be of value to him? He’s already goteverything he needs. He must really like me.’Though on the surface mundane, what Khan does with his hands is actually quiteintoxicating. For brown nosers, both representativeness and availabilityheuristics involve people of lower status sucking up to those of higher status.But confound that expectation, chuck in a bit of antithesis – switch on thehazard signs on those super-fast cognitive expressways – and suddenly,dramatically, we have to slam on the brakes. We have to make sense of thesnarl-up.14 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn14]Psychologist David Strohmetzand his colleagues at Monmouth University have demonstrated a principle verysimilar to the one Khan uses. Only in Strohmetz’s case, the purpose isn’t tofleece people but rather to increase tips in a restaurant. Strohmetz divideddiners into three groups depending on how many sweets each was given at the endof their meal. To one group of diners the waiter gave one sweet. To another, hegave two. And to the third – and here’s the deal – he did this. First he gaveone sweet and then walked away. Then he turned back around (as if having secondthoughts) and added another. So one group got one sweet. And two groups got two.But the two who got two got them in different ways. Got it?Did, as Strohmetz predicted, the number of sweets and the manner in which theywere given have any bearing on tip size?It sure did. Compared to a control group of diners who got no sweets at all(great!), those who got one, tipped, on average, 3.3 per cent higher. Not a badinvestment for an outlay of less than a dime. Similarly, those who received twosweets left, again on average, an extra 14.1 per cent on the table. Even better.But the highest increment of all was shown by those who received first onesweet, then another – a staggering hike in generosity of 23 per cent!That unexpected, and seemingly inexplicable, change of heart (Hey, for you guyshere’s two instead of one!) cut through those purse strings like a knife throughbutter – in exactly the same way that Shaffiq Khan’s unexpected, and seeminglyinexplicable use of touch cut through the purse strings of his unsuspectingvictims.Evolution, on the one hand, has programmed our brains with a fast lane: withcognitive heuristics like representativeness and availability. But it has alsoequipped them with another, more specialist kind of program: an in-builtfacility to make sense of the world – to convert data into meaning, and thechance and the random into pattern. Play one of these programs off against theother – by violating expectation – and the system, momentarily, goes down.Dangerous times if you’re dealing with someone like Khan.AFFILIATIONA king once paid a visit to his country’s prison, and listened intently as oneinmate after another begged to be released on the grounds that they wereinnocent. Suddenly, the king noticed a withdrawn and dejected prisoner sittingby himself in the corner.The king approached the man, and asked him: ‘Why do you look so troubled?’‘Because I’m a criminal,’ the man replied.‘Is that right?’ asked the king.‘Yes,’ said the man. ‘That’s the truth.’Impressed by the man’s honesty, the king ordered his release with the followingobservation: ‘I don’t want this criminal to be in the company of all theseinnocent men. He would be a bad influence on them.’‘No man is an island,’ wrote the poet John Donne who, with apologies to KurtLewin, should really be hailed as the father of social psychology. Ourbehaviour, since ancient times, has been inextricably interwoven with thebehaviour of those around us. And the greatest influence on any of us is otherpeople.GROUP IN-FLUENCEWe humans are hardwired to stick together. To form groups. Not only that, we’realso hardwired to favour the groups we belong to over those we don’t.For no apparent reason.That may seem an odd thing to say. But it’s true. Back in the days of ourancestors, membership of a group constituted the very first life insurancepolicy. And, boy, did we need one. We’ve been renewing that ancient premium eversince.15 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn15]In 1971, the late Henri Tajfelof the University of Bristol conducted an experiment which illustrated preciselythe kind of arrangement that we have with natural selection. Indeed, theexperiment proved so revealing that it’s since become a classic, lending itsname to an entire paradigm within social psychology: the minimal group paradigm.What Tajfel did was this. First, he took a sample of secondary-school studentsand showed them a display of dots.‘How many dots do you see on the screen in front of you?’ he asked each one ofthem individually.Because there were quite a few of them – dots, that is – and the time allowedwas less than half a second, the students had no idea as to the accuracy oftheir estimates. But they provided them anyway – and this deliberatemanipulation conveniently permitted Tajfel to divide the students up into two,completely arbitrary, ‘minimal groups’: under-estimators and overestimators.‘Minimal’ because the categorisation had been trumped up on the basis of atrivial and non-existent difference. ‘Group’ because there were a number ofthem.Once the categorisation had been made, Tajfel then asked each student toallocate points – which they’d been told equated to money – to two of theirfellow participants in the study. These other students were solely identifiableby code – they were anonymous, in other words – and by one or other of thefollowing labels: ‘Of your group’ or ‘Of the other group’.Would the simple fact that the students were members of one group as opposed toanother bias their allocation of points? The answer – which Tajfel and hiscolleagues correctly predicted – was yes. And by quite some margin.Prospects of financial reward were positively showered on the members of one’sown group, and trickled – if that – towards those of the other. What was more,this was in spite of the fact that, prior to showing up for the study, none ofthe participants had met each other before. And, in addition, there hadn’t beenthe slightest indication they would ever do so again. Ergo, no you scratch myback, I’ll scratch yours. Rewards, pure and simple, had been doled out on thebasis of label: my lot as opposed to yours.THE WRONG LINESIt’s not difficult, when one looks at the world, to appreciate the power of thein-group bias. One only has to turn up at a football match to understand thatmuch. But what may come as a surprise is that the effects of group membership gofar beyond a superficial favouritism. They extend, in fact, to how we actuallysee things.Take the following simple problem illustrated below in Figure 3.5. Which of thethree perpendicular lines shown in Box A is the same length as that in Box B?[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_027_r1.jpg]Figure 3.5 – A simple perceptual judgement task. (photo credit 3.5)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c03-fig5a]Piece of cake, right? The middle one – line 2. You’d need your eyes tested ifyou got it wrong. Yet you know what? I bet I could persuade you to do exactlythat – get it wrong – by using a very simple manoeuvre. Don’t believe me?Luckily, you don’t have to.16 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn16]In 1955, the American socialpsychologist Solomon Asch performed exactly such a feat in one of the classicearly demonstrations of the power of conformity. What Asch did was as follows.First, he got a group of nine people together in front of a slide projector.Secondly, he presented the group with a series of 18 line-judgement tasksidentical to the one just shown in Figure 3.5. Thirdly, prior to the start, heinstructed eight of the nine group members (his evil co-conspirators) to givethe same predetermined wrong answer on six of the 18 comparisons. Lastly, he satback and watched what the ninth guy would say. Would he, in the face of suchunanimous disagreement, stick to his guns and give the correct – and obvious –answer? The one that was, quite literally, staring him in the face? Or would hecave in to peer pressure and go against the evidence of his senses?What Asch found was astonishing. Of those who participated in the study, 76 percent gave at least one wrong answer during the course of the proceedings. Thinkabout that for a moment. They gave the wrong answer – over three-quarters ofthem – to a task as simple as the one just demonstrated. The conclusion was asclear-cut as it was scary. So great is our desire to fit in that most of us areprepared to disbelieve even what our own eyes are telling us, so as not to standout. Majority opinion is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. Few ofus, it would seem, have the psychology to hold out against it.4Why do you think that canned laughter is so popular on TV sitcoms? Or that, onthe campaign trail, not all of the applause is – shall we say – as spontaneousas it seems? Devices such as these sneak into our brains through the back doorand engage our emotions in neurological pantomime. They persuade us (or rather,help us persuade ourselves) that whatever or whoever we’re watching is morehumorous, more entertaining, or more interesting than they really are. I mean,if everybody else is laughing or applauding or jeering – then why not us?But there’s more to this pantomime than meets the eye. The affirmation, orderogation, of a communicator by an audience moulds our perception not just ofhow funny or entertaining they are, but also how influential. How suitable theymay be for office. And it’s then that things start to get serious.17 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn17]There are few better examplesof influence such as this than a study conducted in 1993 during the thirdBush–Clinton presidential debate. Three groups of 30 students each werecarefully assembled on the basis of political allegiance. The first group (whichactually consisted of only 20 ‘real’ participants – a mixture of Republicans andDemocrats) concealed ten plants who cheered Bush and jeered Clinton. The secondgroup – again consisting of only 20 ‘real’ participants – concealed ten plantswho, you got it, cheered Clinton and jeered Bush. A third group – the control –remained neutral.What impact, respectively, would the two lobbying factions have on ‘real’participants’ ratings of the candidates?The results from the pro-Clinton lobby group (the group with the ten plants whocheered Clinton and jeered Bush) are shown in Figure 3.6, overleaf. They proveda real eye-opener.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_028_r1.jpg]Figure 3.6 – The effect of audience reaction on political allegiance. (photocredit 3.6) [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c03-fig6a]On the right – among the real Clinton supporters – we observe Clinton’s ratingssoar when Bush is jeered and Clinton cheered. No surprises there. But just lookwhat happens on the left – this time in the Bush camp – under the sameconditions. Incredibly, even ‘real-life’ Bush supporters evaluated Clinton morefavourably than their own man when the former was booed and the latterapplauded! Sometimes, it would seem, the way we see others depends on nothingmore substantial than the way others see others.POUND FOR POUNDExamples such as this are well known within the science of influence asinstances of social proof. Social proof is what Keith Barrett might describe asa virus of affiliation – and occurs in ambiguous social situations when one isunable to determine what, precisely, is the ‘done thing’. We’ve all been there.I guess the classic example is sitting down to one of those fussy, 35-coursedinners only to discover that the display of cutlery bears a frighteningresemblance to something we might find in an operating theatre. What do we do?Where do we start? Which knife do we use for the butter? What’s that funnypointy-shaped thing next to that other funny pointy-shaped thing with the littlehook on the end? Making the assumption that the guy sitting next to us has seenit all before, most of us resort to guerrilla tactics. We scrutinise him out ofthe corner of our eye. Observe where his fingers alight upon thesilverware … and then apprehend that very same implement ourselves – totallyunaware that our worldly bon vivant has just spent the past five minutessecretly quinting at us.A fascinating demonstration of the power of social proof occurred not so longago on American TV. Colleen Szot, an ‘infomercial’ writer, completelyobliterated a home shopping channel sales record by changing just three words ofa now familiar sales pitch. The record had stood for almost 20 years. Sure, thechannel featured all the usual marketing paraphernalia: celebrity endorsements,catchy soundbites, and an audience that looked like it was on speed. But,remarkably, it wasn’t any of these that finally sent sales through the roof.Instead, it was a change for the worse. Or so, on the face of it, it seemed.Szot’s masterstroke was to tweak the standard call-to-action line ‘Operators arewaiting, please call now’ to ‘If operators are busy, please call again’. Atfirst glance, such nuancing appears disastrous. How does alerting customers tothe prospect of inconvenience – dialling and redialling the same damn’ number –possibly translate into increased sales? But logic, in this case, leaves much tobe desired – and doesn’t take into account the magic of social proof.Think about it. What image springs to mind when you hear the phrase ‘Operatorsare waiting, please call now’? Legions of bored telephonists staring into space?If so, then despite all the flashy, trashy merchandising your impression of theproduct is negative. It’s an impression of low demand and poor sales. Why thehell would you want to buy it if nobody else does?Now ask yourself this. What comes to mind when you hear the phrase ‘If operatorsare busy, please call again’? A buzzing call centre full of overstretched staffstruggling to keep pace with demand? Now that’s more like it! If everyone elseis getting in on the action – then you’re sure as hell not going to miss out!18 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn18]Exactly the same principleworks on eBay. Analysis of online auctions reveals something primal, profoundand fundamentally potty about consumer behaviour: if you want to flog thatRembrandt you found in the attic, start at $10! The psychology here is actuallyquite straightforward. Kicking things off with a low opening bid attracts agreater number of people to the auction – which, in turn, makes the productappear more desirable. This generates even more bidders who, with every mountingoffer, increase not only their financial investment in the product but theiremotional investment too.A friend of mine who teaches Decision Science demonstrates this in the lecturehall. Not with a Rembrandt, but with a £1 coin. Every year at the beginning ofthe winter term, he stands in front of a packed auditorium of freshers andannounces that he’s going to auction … £1. What am I bid? he asks. The auctionhas two simple rules. The first rule – like that of any auction – is thatwhoever puts in the highest bid gets to keep the merchandise. No problems there.The second rule is that the person who enters the next highest bid forfeits thatbid to the auctioneer. No problem there either – so long as you win.Ever since the inaugural £1 auction several years ago, my friend’s students,without exception, have remained neuroeconomically impervious to thejuxtaposition of these two conditions. They see it every time as a gilt-edgedopportunity to get something for nothing. Or, if not for nothing, then at leastfor less than £1. He must be crazy, they think. The first bid usually weighs inat a penny. Surprise, surprise. Then two pence. And three pence. And so on.Everyone’s in. And no one is any the wiser. Then suddenly, as the bidding warreaches the 50/51 stage, realisation dawns. My friend is in the black! Thinkabout it. Were the auction to end right there, he would, according to the rulesof the game, already be a penny to the good. What a rip-off!But the auction doesn’t end there, of course. It runs and runs. In fact, it’snot unusual for the £1 to go for £2, entailing a net profit on the initialinvestment of nearly £3 (£2 winning bid + £1.99 forfeit of the runner-up.) Whatstarted out as good, old-fashioned greed soon metastasises into a hideous,mutually-dependent – yet at the same time mutually-exclusive – foray into damagelimitation. We don’t just compete to maximise our gains. But also – who’d havethought it? – to maximise our losses.DO UNTO OTHERSIn 1993, Manchester United won their first league title in 26 years. It was thefirst of 11 (and counting) under their legendary Scottish manager Sir AlexFerguson. Ferguson is still in charge of Manchester United today and is nowEngland’s longest serving, and most successful, football coach. But in 1993things were different. Up until that first league title, the Manchester Unitedtrophy cabinet had been gathering dust for a while – and Ferguson was worriedthat the arrival of a bit of silverware might go to the players’ heads. What todo?Some managers might well have let the players just get on with it, and bask intheir hard-earned glory. Which, to be fair, Ferguson did. Up to a point. But thecanny Glaswegian wasn’t content with just the one title. He already had an eyeon history. So he devised a plan to see them on their way: a simple stroke ofgenius that not only got the absolute best out of his players – it scared theshit out of them.19 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn19]Ferguson remembers it likethis:I said, ‘I’ve written three names down. I’ve put them in an envelope. Those arethe three players that are going to let us down next season.’ And they’re alllooking at each other and saying, ‘Well, it’s not me!’ So the next season I didit again … Of course, there was no envelope … but it was just a challenge tothem, because dealing with success is not easy.Ferguson’s strategy was lethal. Not only did Manchester United go on to win theleague title again the following year, they have now, 16 years on, chalked up atotal of 22 major trophies under his stewardship. Success went to the players’heads all right – but in a manner that was constructive. They wanted more. Andwhy? Because Ferguson released a virulent strain of persuasion that laideveryone equally low. That tapped straight into their ancient, hardwired need tobe team members. And it was all just a simple con.A policeman friend of mine uses a similar strategy in his job with problem kids.Richard Newman, who works as part of the Youth Offending Team in Cambridge,points out that teenagers are particularly susceptible to peer pressure and thatthe ‘you’re ruining it for everyone else’ line often succeeds where cajoling andcoercion fail. To illustrate, he recalls an incident that took place severalyears ago on a group outing to the zoo.There were fifteen kids in the van and one of them, a really hard kid, wouldn’tdo up his seatbelt. ‘Gavin,’ I said, ‘do up your seatbelt – now!’ He wouldn’tlisten. So I pulled over to the side of the road and told him I wanted to speakto him outside. ‘Come on then,’ he said, as he got out, ‘hit me!’ I said,‘Gavin, I’m not going to hit you. But I’ll tell you something. We’re not goinganywhere until you do up your seatbelt.’Then I pointed inside the van.‘Now fourteen of your mates in there all want to go to the zoo,’ I said. ‘Thelonger we stand here talking, the less time we’re going to have when we getthere. So how about you just put on the belt and we get moving?’ The result wasalmost instant. He thought about it for five seconds or so, then got back in. Hewas good as gold after that.DYING TO BELONGThe wisdom of Newman’s approach comes as no great surprise to his colleagues inlaw enforcement. True, not all teenagers are as easily led as others. 20[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn20]And those that are not, a recentstudy shows, actually present with subtle neuroanatomical differences: decreasedactivity, on exposure to socially relevant stimuli, in the areas of the brainassociated with motor preparation, planning and attentional control (the rightdorsal premotor cortex and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and greaterfunctional connectivity between these regions and areas of the temporal cortexassociated with action observation and processing. But the trend, one mightargue, along with countless millions of parents, is pretty hard to ignore.21 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn21]Young male syndrome is apattern of behaviour well known to forensic psychologists and police detectivesalike. The population subset most likely either to kill or be killed comprisesyoung men between their adolescence and mid-20s. Which, it turns out, is alsothe time of greatest competition for mates.To casual observers the world over, it often seems inconceivable how murder andserious injury are inextricably linked to ostensibly trivial disputes. Yet weshouldn’t be so surprised. There are evolutionary ley lines at work here,stretching all the way back from the pool-tables and dance-floors of inner citybars to the forests and savannahs of our past: a primordial whisper’s ghostlyintimation that it’s not so much how we see ourselves that’s important, butrather how others see us. And when one thinks about it, it makes perfect sense.Saturday night in the middle of London or New York would not, fundamentally, beall that dissimilar to that on the savannah of primal East Africa. More queues,I guess, but essentially the same dynamic.In fact, in their mid-20s males are six times more likely than females to be thevictims of homicide. Moreover – and herein lies the key – the majority of suchhomicides are committed in the presence of an audience. On the street. In a bar.In a club. They are, as it were, advertisements. But advertisements for what,exactly?Some years ago now, I interviewed a sex offender who’d raped a woman atknifepoint. Two of his friends had also taken their turn. Why did you do it? Iasked him. With the icy detachment typical of the psychopath, he shrugged.‘It’s like buying drinks in a bar,’ he said. ‘You get a sense of identity. Ofgroup camaraderie.’Such a view is echoed in the literature. While no one would deny – and we see itoften enough – the insidious connection between group identity and violence, thepolarity of such a dynamic can also be seen to reverse. Violent behaviour may,in contrast, help facilitate group cohesion.‘22 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn22]One of the unique dynamics ingang rape,’ writes the clinical psychologist Nicholas Groth, ‘is the experienceof rapport, fellowship and co-operation with the co-defenders. It appears [as ifthe offender] is using the victim as a vehicle for interacting with othermen … behaving … in accordance with what he feels is expected ofhim … validating himself and participating in group activity.’23 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c03-ftn23]A similar phenomenon may alsobe found in the gay community. ‘Suicide bumming’ (as one guy I spoke to put it)refers to the practice by which healthy individuals deliberately have sex tocontract the HIV virus. They achieve this by engaging in prearranged, systematicpenetration with a succession of HIV-positive partners. One after the other. Andthen plug up the rectum to prevent the semen escaping. It’s called, on thescene, ‘the gift’.In a bar in San Francisco, I ask one guy why he did it.He has no hesitation in telling me.‘You feel, I don’t know, more part of things,’ he says. ‘Like you belong more.’A friend – young, beautiful, and also HIV-positive – comes over to join us. Iask him the same question. He smiles.‘It’s a sign of commitment,’ he says. ‘Of solidarity. It’s turning a negativeinto a positive. It’s like getting a tattoo, only on the inside. It’s like animmunological tattoo.’SUMMARYIn this chapter we’ve continued our tour of the key stimuli of influence bycrossing the consciousness border. We entered the airspace of perception andsocial cognition and discovered that neural sophistication in no way precludesthe kinds of instinctive, rapid response sets that we see in animals.Consciousness may well be handy, but it’s slow: too slow, at times, for life towait around for. So to bridge the gap, the brain employs heuristics – rules ofthumb that rely on past experience; on learned associations between previouslyencountered stimuli. If consciousness had wheels there’d be eighteen of them.And a trailer so big you’d need planning permission to park it. Hardly ideal forgetting across town in a hurry.Taking the advice of a psychopathic genius conman (and why not?), we examinedthree areas of cognitive process: attention, approach, and affiliation. In eachof these areas we saw how the brain may be brought to its knees as fast as anyfixed action pattern we may find in the animal kingdom. We discovered, usingsome simple influence techniques, how we may harness the brain’s impulsivenessto our benefit. And how, in the hands of the genius persuader, these sametechniques can often cost us dear.In the next chapter [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c04_r1.htm], we widen the researchspotlight. Having familiarised ourselves with the black arts of socialinfluence, we now take in the white, and look at how psychological cat burglarssuch as lawyers, advertisers, salespeople and cult leaders – those who work withus rather than against us – crack our neural thought codes. It’s easier than youthink. The brain’s security isn’t exactly tight – and if you know what you’redoing you can be in and out in seconds.MEMORY TESTYou have ten seconds to look at the words printed below.

If you did, you’re in themajority. But take another look and you’ll find that the word SWEET wasn’t thereeither! The way it works is like this. The brain likes to impose order on theworld. Make things nice and easy. When there are gaps it likes to fill them in;we get a sort of hunch, a kind of gut feeling about things.Read over the list again and what do you notice? That’s right, each word thatappears on it is linked in some way to the word SWEET. Either semantically (e.g.CHOCOLATE) or linguistically (e.g. SWEET-HEART). Which fools you into thinkingthat the word was there when it wasn’t.Your brain took a gamble, and ended up paying the price. Fortunately, on thisoccasion, it didn’t prove too costly.Which of the following four words did NOT appear on the list: SUGAR, TASTE,SWEET, BOOMERANG?1 According to Alexander Schauss of the American Institute for BiosocialResearch, dark brown or neutral grey flooring is best, and the optimal lightinglevel – ‘giving off a milder form of malillumination with colour-renderingdistortion peaking in the red-orange range’ – around 100 watts. As to thescience underlying this, speculation is currently ongoing – with researchfocusing on metabolic changes in neurotransmitters such as serotonin andnorepinephrine, or in hormones serving the hypothalamus (the part of the brainthat oversees the control of emotion). Pink, it would seem, is nature’s Prozac.2 In Appendix 1 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm2_r1.htm] (this page[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm2_r1.htm#page337]), you can test this out foryourself by giving the brief character sketches – and subsequentimpression-formation task – to your friends.

Jones describes an experimentconducted in a public health organisation. He writes as follows: ‘The groupstudied was a detoxification clinic, a place where alcoholism is treated. Thiswas an ideal setting in which to study status, sex roles, and touching … [The]findings showed two clear trends. First, women on the average initiated moretouches to men than vice versa. Second, touching tended to flow upwards, notdownwards, in the hierarchy.’ (Author’s emphasis.)4 A recent study by Vasily Klucharev at the Donders Institute for Brain,Cognition and Behaviour at Radboud University in the Netherlands has revealed apossible neural correlate of conformity. In a facial attractiveness judgementtask, Klucharev and his co-workers have found that individual conflict withgroup opinion triggers increased activity in both the rostral section of theanterior cingulate cortex, and the ventral striatum: areas of the brainimplicated in error detection and decision-making under unusual circumstances.(See Klucharev, Vasily, Hytönen, Kaisa, Rijpkema, Mark, Smidts, Ale andFernández, Guillén, ‘Reinforcement Learning Signal Predicts Social Conformity,’Neuron 61(1), (2009): 140–151."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4PERSUASION GRANDMASTERSOne morning, on arriving at his chambers, a lawyer discovers a surprise parcelwaiting for him on his desk. On removing the outer packaging, he finds inside abox of the finest Havana cigars: a present from one of his clients for aparticularly brilliant performance. On account of the rarity of the cigars, andof their not inconsiderable value, the lawyer decides to insure them. For$25,000. Over a period of the next few months, he then proceeds to smoke thecigars one by one (there are a dozen of them), until one evening, as hecontentedly puffs on the last, he has an idea. Had he not insured themerchandise against precisely the fate that has now befallen them? Destruction,get this, by fire?Chancing his arm, the lawyer files a claim against the insurance company. Whichthe insurance company, perhaps not surprisingly, decides to contest. The casegoes to court, and the lawyer – would you believe it? – emerges victorious. Eventhough the claim appears ludicrous, the judge remarks, there is nothing in thesmall print to preclude the award of damages. So a ruling is made in favour ofthe claimant. And the lawyer decamps some $25,000 better off. Nice work if youcan get it.Several weeks go by and the matter is quickly forgotten. Or so it seems. Thenone morning everything changes. An envelope drops through the letterbox of thelawyer’s chambers. From the insurance company. They are suing the lawyer forarson – on 12 counts – and a date has been set for the hearing. This time, ofcourse, the boot’s on the other foot. Pointing out that it would constitute anunprecedented breach of practice were the lawyer now to contradict the argumentthat had secured his victory in the previous case, the judge, on this occasion,awards damages, plus costs, to the insurance company. A sum total of $40 000. Acase, one might say, of no smoke without fire.‘Advertising may be described as the science of arresting human intelligencelong enough to get money from it’ – Stephen Butler Leacock, The Garden of Folly(1924)THE ART OF A GOOD STORYWhat makes a good lawyer? I mean, a really good one. What’s the differencebetween the guy who’s brilliant in the courtroom and the guy who’s just average?What have the stars got that the rest haven’t? When I first started thinkingabout these questions I had no idea of the answer. But I knew a man who would.Michael Mansfield is one of the world’s greatest advocates. In his 40 years atthe Bar, he’s forged a reputation for fighting cases no other lawyer will touch.Consumed by abhorrence for hypocrisy and injustice, Mansfield’s casebook readslike a resumé of modern British social history: the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, theMarchioness disaster, the Birmingham Six, Stephen Lawrence, Dodi Fayed and thePrincess of Wales, and, most recently, the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes.I meet him at his chambers in Central London. He’s a dapper 67 withshoulder-length, swept-back hair and spacious, steely blue eyes. He’s wearing adark pinstripe suit and an open-necked shirt with a broad gingham check. Theshirt is pink, and the hair is silver. Keith Barrett, I think. Only this time onthe right side of the law.I ask him what makes the great barrister great.‘Cases are won and lost not just on the strength of facts,’ he purrs, ‘but onimpressions. A lot is achieved through the power of suggestion. The experiencedbarrister tells a story in court, and subtly spirits the jurors away with him ona narrative journey. The first thing members of a jury get in a courtroom is agut instinct. They make up their minds with their hearts. The trick then is topresent the evidence in such a way that it corroborates that initial gutinstinct. It’s just like in everyday life. It’s much easier to convince someonethat they were right all along than that they were wrong all along! Goodbarristers are also good psychologists. It’s not just about presenting theevidence. It’s about how you present it.’The importance of a coherent narrative is one of the fundamental principles ofany type of persuasion. Not just in the courtroom but in the boardroom, on thecampaign trail, or simply in everyday life. Frank Luntz is an American authorand pollster, and a specialist in political persuasion. Early in his career,Luntz worked for the Independent candidate Ross Perot during his firstpresidential campaign – when Perot was at the peak of his powers, and the zenithof his popularity. Once, Luntz recalls, in Detroit, he organised a focus groupto gauge the appeal of various Perot television ads. There were three in total:a biography, a Perot speech, and testimonials from other people.When Luntz ran the ads in that order – biography, speech, testimonial – he foundthat Perot’s popularity ratings within the focus group exactly mirrored pollstaken from outside, among the general public at large.No surprises there.But when, by mistake, he ran the ads in the ‘wrong’ order – testimonials,speech, biography – something very strange happened. Suddenly, the people in thefocus group didn’t really like Perot all that much. Divorced from his personalhistory, his opinions appeared intemperate. Which, counsels Luntz, just goes toshow: ‘1 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn1]The order in which yougive information determines how people think.’A friend of mine, Roz, provides a wonderful example of this ‘order effect’ ofpersuasion. Roz’s mother Molly is 85 and fiercely independent. For as long asI’ve known her, Molly has resisted the idea of acquiring even the mostrudimentary assistance at home – despite the fact that she now has troubledressing, and her memory is not what it was. Poor Roz. Countless times she’dpleaded with her mother to see reason. To at least consider the possibility ofhelp, adding, ‘It’ll make a real difference to your life – as it has to MrsMcIntyre round the corner.’ But her efforts had come to nothing.Then one day, just like Frank Luntz, she played the tape in the ‘wrong’ order.First, she mentioned that Kay [McIntyre] round the corner seemed much happierafter the introduction of her home-care package. Then she suggested thepossibility of her mum getting one too.The new storyline worked. Molly came round to the idea.‘It was like someone had waved a magic wand,’ Roz recalls. ‘Whereas before she’dbeen dead against it, out of the blue she just said, “Hmmh. Well, I suppose wecould give it a try. I guess I do need a bit of help in the mornings. And ifit’s working for Kay, it can’t do any harm.” ‘Kay was the undercoat on which the gloss of influence took hold.Precisely how impressionable we are, just how swept along we can be by a goodstory, may be seen from the following. And remember, in the courtroom suchjudgements are crucial.What I want you to do is read the scenario below and then answer the questionafterwards:John is driving at 40 m.p.h. in a 30 m.p.h. zone and runs into another car at anintersection. The point of impact is on the driver’s side. The driver of theother car receives multiple injuries including lacerations, a broken collarboneand a fractured wrist. John himself is unscathed. John was speeding because hewas rushing home to hide an anniversary present for his parents that he’dinadvertently left out on the kitchen table. The accident was exacerbated by thefact that he had to navigate an oil spill on his approach to the junction.Question: On a scale of 1–10, where 1 = not to blame at all and 10 = totally toblame, to what extent do you think John was at fault in causing the accident?Indicate your answer by circling the scale below:[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_029_r1.jpg]Now give the following scenario to a friend and ask them to make a similarjudgement:John is driving at 40 m.p.h. in a 30 m.p.h. zone and runs into another car at anintersection. The point of impact is on the driver’s side. The driver of theother car receives multiple injuries including lacerations, a broken collarboneand a fractured wrist. John himself is unscathed. John was speeding because hewas rushing home to hide a stash of cocaine from his parents that he’dinadvertently left out on the kitchen table. The accident was exacerbated by thefact that he had to navigate an oil spill on his approach to the junction.Now I wouldn’t mind betting that you and your friend had a bit of a disagreementover this one. And I’d also lay odds that your friend took a dimmer view ofJohn’s driving than you did. But hang on a minute. Why? Why is John more toblame when he’s going home for the coke? Whatever John had inadvertently leftout on the kitchen table, he was still doing 40 m.p.h. in a 30 m.p.h. zone,wasn’t he?At this point you may feel as if you’ve been set up. You haven’t. 2[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn2]Precisely these two scenarios werepresented to a group of college students as part of an experiment conducted bythe University of Ohio-based psychologist Mark Alicke. And you know what? Theirresponses exactly mirrored those of you and your friend. When John was on hisway home to hide the anniversary present, the cause of the accident was split50:50 between ‘something about John’ and ‘something about the situation’ (i.e.the oil spill). But when he was on his way home to stash his drugs it was adifferent story altogether. It was all him. Somehow, John’s prior intentionsrender him a more ‘culpable’ individual overall. And the more culpable weperceive someone to be, the more we attribute an internal, ‘dispositional’ causeto their actions when those actions turn out badly.JUDGING THE COVER BY THE BOOKA man is in the final stages of getting things ready for his wedding.Everything’s going well except for the one small matter of his bride-to-be’sextremely hot younger sister. One afternoon, a week before the big day, he findshimself alone with her in the house. She sidles up beside him and suggests theygo upstairs – before he finally settles down to a life of wedded bliss. The manbegins to panic. Running through his options, he charges out of the house – onlythere, in the front garden, to discover the rest of the girl’s family allwaiting for him. As soon as he emerges, they give him a big round of applause.‘Congratulations,’ says his future father-in-law. ‘You’ve passed the test. Youhave proved yourself a man of honour and integrity, and I’m delighted to giveyou my daughter’s hand in marriage.’The fiancé can’t believe it, and breathes a huge sigh of relief. His wife-to-beplants a big kiss on his cheek.Moral of the story? Always leave your condoms in the car.Within social psychology, the kind of error that you probably just made – andthe kind of trap we fell into previously with John and his drugs and theanniversary present – supports nothing short of a cottage industry of researchinto the way our brains play tricks on us. The way, in little more than aninstant, that the world’s most complex computer can change, behind our veryeyes, into the world’s most complex whoopee cushion. Such cognitive flatulence –the irresistible tendency, when evaluating individual behaviour, to giveprecedence to internal, dispositional factors over external, situational ones(especially when that behaviour is our own and happens to be good, or is that ofsomebody else and happens to be bad) has a name in psychology: the fundamentalattribution error. And with good reason. It is, as its name suggests,fundamental.3 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn3]Just how fundamental is revealedin a study conducted by Lee Ross, Professor of Social Psychology at StanfordUniversity. Pairs of college students first drew lots to determine who wouldplay the role of question master and who would be the contestant in a mock quizgame. Each question master was then allotted a period of 15 minutes in which togenerate a series of ‘general world knowledge’ questions. But there was a catch.These questions were to be specifically devised so that the answers wereunlikely to be known by anyone else except the question masters themselves. Trueto form, once the quiz got underway, most of the contestants bombed. Big deal.Except that this wasn’t the point of the study. Instead, at the conclusion ofthe quiz, everyone involved – the question masters, the contestants, plus someobservers who hadn’t actually participated in the game, just watched – wereasked to estimate the level of each participant’s general knowledge.The results are shown below.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_030_r1.jpg]Figure 4.1 – Actions speak louder than words – even when they’re staged. (photocredit 4.1) [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c04-fig1a]As can be seen, the question masters – either through feigned modesty orappropriate acknowledgement of the situational constraints – rated themselves asonly slightly more knowledgeable than the contestants. Which may, or may not,have been true. But the contestants and observers – well, they were a differentstory altogether. Just look at the disparities in the middle and right-handsections of the graph in relation to the knowledge base of the question mastersand their ‘victims’.Even though the contestants had clearly overheard the researcher’s instructionsto the effect that the questions should be drawn from an idiosyncratic pool ofknowledge unknown to anyone else but the question master … and even though theyclearly recalled drawing lots to decide who would be question master and who thecontestant so that, in a parallel universe, the roles might so easily have beenreversed … even though they had experienced first-hand – and were perfectly wellaware of – the overwhelming situational odds that were against them … they stillexhibited a flagrant disregard for the impact that these odds might have had onthe way things turned out.The question master acted smart. So the correspondent inference had to be thathe/she was smart. In fact the observers rated the question master as being moreclued up than 80 per cent of all the other students at the university!The fundamental attribution error offers us a prime example of what MichaelMansfield was referring to when he talked about impressions and the power ofnarrative. Take a rape case, for instance. In the courtroom, rape oftenconstitutes a crucible of persuasion ju-jitsu in which opposing lawyers lockhorns not so much over the minds of the jury as over their hearts. Let’s take alook at each side in turn, beginning with the case for the prosecution.The prosecutor knows that, for any behaviour, an attribution of disposition(personal responsibility) overrides that of situation (external influences) whenattention is focused on the agent of that behaviour. This is what happened inthe mock quiz game. Smart (the disposition of the question master, or agent)trumped experimental protocol (the situation in which the agent was acting), anddid so quite spontaneously. We just can’t help it. We have a powerful, in-builtbias that predisposes us to think in a certain way: namely, that we do thethings we do because we’re the kinds of people who do those things! It’s anevolutionary rule-of-thumb. A timesaving device programmed into our brains overmillions and millions of years by natural selection. If, for every singlebehaviour, we had no alternative but to engage in a protracted investigation ofevery possible contributing factor, how far do you think we’d get? Precisely. Sowe start with the person instead.The experienced prosecutor is well aware of this principle. They are, exactly asMansfield said, just as much psychologists as they are lawyers. So what do theydo? What is their plan of attack? Well, it’s like this. What the prosecutor willattempt to achieve is to focus the jury’s attention solely on the allegedrapist. Manoeuvre them into a position where they’re forced to ask themselvesthe question: Why did he do it? They’ll concentrate on the defendant’s previousrelationships with women. (Perhaps he’s exhibited aggressive tendencies in thepast?) Or on his mental state at the time of the incident in question. (Perhapshe was drunk, or under the influence of drugs?) This, combined with an attendantemphasis on rape as a violent, as opposed to an erotic, act tells a simple,coherent ‘story’ – one which plays right into the hands of the fundamentalattribution error. With their attention focused solely on the defendant, andforced to account for his actions, there is, so far as the jury is concerned,only one reasonable conclusion. They’ll presume that he is guilty.In contrast, however, the case for the defence will endeavour to focus thejury’s attention solely on the behaviour of the victim. Get them to askthemselves the question: Why was she raped? They’ll concentrate on factors suchas how she was dressed. (Provocatively?) How she might have behaved prior to theattack. (Flirtatiously?) And on her previous sexual history. (Promiscuous?)This, combined with a counter-emphasis on the possible erotic elements of rape,tells a totally different ‘story’ – one likely to engender the antagonisticinference: she asked for it.And in case you’re wondering what previous sexual history has got to do with it– the answer, unfortunately, is quite a lot. 4[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn4]Studies involving mock juries haveshown that the amount of blame attributed to a rapist is often contingent justas much on victim characteristics as it is on the rape itself. A rapist isconsidered less culpable, for example, if he attacks a topless dancer than if heattacks a nun; and a woman who’s divorced as opposed to one who’s married.Just like with John. And the drugs. And the anniversary present.LOOK AT IT LIKE THISFollowing much media speculation over the demise of Osama bin Laden, bin Ladenhimself decides to send Barack Obama a letter in his own handwriting to show himhe’s still around. On opening the letter, Obama discovers it contains thefollowing cryptogram:370HSSV-0773H.Despite hours of careful scrutiny, the President is completely stumped, so hetypes it out and mails it to Hillary Clinton. Hillary and her aides aresimilarly none the wiser so they, in turn, send it to the CIA. Again, no luck.So the message, over time, makes its way to the NSA, to MIT, to NASA, andeventually to the Secret Service. Still no one is able to decipher it. Finally,in desperation, the Secret Service dispatches it to MI6 in London.‘This message,’ they say, ‘has remained inscrutable to the finest minds inAmerica – as well as to Hillary Clinton. As a last resort, we were hoping thatyou might be able to discern its significance.’Five minutes later a cable comes through to the White House: ‘Tell the Presidentto look at it upside down.’The psychological chicanery that we see in litigation is well known to studentsof social influence. It even has a name – framing – and is by no means confinedto the courtroom. Sure, Mansfield and his buddies might well be the best in thebusiness, but there are others out there who are just as quick on the draw.Advertising, politics, and sales, for instance, are just a few examples ofprofessions in which this simple art of suggestion is also practised.Then, as we just saw with the cryptogram, there’s everyday life. 5[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn5]Psychologist George Bizer of UnionCollege, New York has studied the role of framing in politics. Morespecifically, in election campaigns. Do the ways in which voters come to expresstheir views, Bizer wondered, impact on their strength of conviction?To find out, Bizer asked a group of college students to read brief ‘newsreports’ of two fictitious candidates (Rick, a conservative and Chris, aliberal.) He then divided the students up into two groups. One group had tochoose between the pair of statements ‘I support Rick’ or ‘I oppose Rick’. Theother had to make an equivalent choice in relation to Chris. At this stage, eachgroup also indicated their preferences for both candidates on a scale rangingfrom ‘strongly support’ to ‘strongly oppose’.Then came the twist.After registering their level of support for Rick and Chris, each group read asubsequent news report which was openly derogatory towards the policies of theirpreferred candidate. Allegiances were then reassessed.Would the way in which participants initially framed their preferences for thetwo candidates have any bearing on how their opinions shifted during this secondphase of voting?The answer, it turned out, was yes.In general, those students who’d conceptualised their preference for a candidatein terms of opposition to the other candidate (e.g. ‘I oppose Rick’ rather than‘I support Chris’) were more resistant to change (i.e. were more likely to standby Chris when he came under fire) than those whose preferences were positivelyframed.‘A simple change in framing, leading people to think of their evaluations interms of whom they oppose instead of whom they support,’ says Bizer, ‘leads tostronger, more resistant opinions.’Framing, of course, doesn’t just deal in emotions. It is, as Keith Barrett wouldsay, primarily a virus of attention. To give you an example, ask a friend thefollowing question:How many litres of diesel does it take to fill up a jumbo jet. Is it more orless than 500?Then ask another friend exactly the same question, only with a subtle twist:How many litres of diesel does it take to fill up a jumbo jet. Is it more orless than 500,000?Now ask each of them in turn to come up with a concrete estimate of just howmany litres of diesel it really does take to fill up a jumbo jet. (Actually it’saround 220,000.) Chances are you’ll notice something rather interesting in theirpattern of responses. The friend you asked second (more or less than 500,000)will come up with a higher estimate than the friend you asked first (more orless than 500).The reason for this has to do with something called anchoring. What happens isthis. Both friends quite literally use the numbers that you put into their heads(500 vs 500,000) as frames of reference – anchoring points – on which to basetheir judgements. These numbers don’t even need to be relevant to the issue athand (in the jumbo jet example, we could just as easily have said 1 litre vs1,000,000 litres.) They just need to be there. They persuade by presence alone.6 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn6]In 2006, a team of Germanpsychologists, Birte Englich, Fritz Strack and Thomas Mussweiler, provided aclassic demonstration of the power of anchoring – funnily enough, in the legalprofession. The team took a group of experienced judges and asked them to readan outline of a case. The case involved a man who’d been convicted of rape. Oncethey’d familiarised themselves with the details, the judges were then divided upinto two groups. One group were to imagine the following: that while the courtwas adjourned, they received, in their chambers, a telephone call from ajournalist. This journalist posed them the following question: Would thesentence be higher or lower than three years? The other group were presentedwith a slightly different scenario. They, too, were told that they’d receive atelephone call from a journalist – only in this case the journalist wouldenquire whether or not the sentence would be higher or lower than one year.Would this simple differential in numbers – three vs one – have any effect onthe actual number of years meted out by the judges?It sure did. Just as the anchoring hypothesis predicted, the average length ofsentence handed down by the judges in the first group was 33 months. In thesecond, it was 25.DEVIL IN THE DETAILThe most obvious place we might encounter anchoring is, of course, in themarketing business. We’ve all haggled over the price of something or other – andopened with a figure we know we’ll have to improve on. But what isn’t so obviousis the ease with which some of the more sophisticated persuasion strategies –techniques we barely even notice – can pickpocket our brains. Take pricing, forinstance. Ever wondered why your favourite hair product is marked up at £9.95instead of a round £10? 7 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn7]ChrisJaniszewski and Dan Uy at the University of Florida have recently contemplatedexactly such a question – and arrived at a surprising conclusion. Rather than‘nine just seeming cheaper than ten’ (which is what most people say when asked),it’s actually a bit more complicated.Janiszewski and Uy performed a series of experiments in which volunteers werepresented with hypothetical salesroom scenarios. In each scenario, volunteersimagined that they were buying an item (e.g. a high-definition plasma TV) at aparticular retail price. They were then required to guesstimate the wholesalecost to the vendor. ‘Consumers’ were divided up into three groups. One group ofbuyers were told that the TV cost $5,000; a second group that it cost $4,988;and a third that it cost $5,012.Would these different anchoring points – negligible in relation to the totalprice – have an impact on participants’ wholesale quotes?Remarkably, they did.Those buyers who were given the $5,000 price tag estimated wholesale costs to besignificantly lower than those who’d deliberated over the more precise figures.Moreover, recipients of the $5,000 label showed a far greater propensity toestimate a wholesale cost in round numbers than those who’d started withoutthem.But why?To explain their results, Janiszewski and Uy speculate as to what the brainmight be doing when it calculates such differentials – the precise anatomy ofthe comparison procedure. Or, more specifically, its units of measurement. Couldit be that these units of measurement are variable, and contingent on certaincharacteristics of the initial price? Let’s say, for example, that we go into ashop and spot a clock radio on display for £30. On seeing the radio we mightwell think to ourselves: that radio is really worth around £28 or £29. Wholenumbers. On the other hand, if we see it retailing at £29.95 we might stillbelieve that it’s worth less than the asking price – but the yardstick we use toevaluate the disparity is different. This time its intervals are smaller. Ratherthan thinking in whole, round pounds we think, instead, in loose change. Weconsider, perhaps, £29.75 or £29.50 as the ‘true’ wholesale value – less of adifferential than if we were thinking in whole numbers. Which makes it more of abargain.To test their theory, Janiszewski and Uy headed out of the lab and into the realworld. To Alachua County, Florida, to be precise. There, they looked at realestate – comparing the asking prices of houses with the amount that theyactually sold for. Just as they’d predicted, sellers who put their houses on themarket for more precise sums (e.g. $596,500 as opposed to $600,000) gotconsistently closer to their asking price than the round-number vendors. Andthat wasn’t all. In the event of a slump in the market, those houses advertisedfor round figure sums depreciated more in value than ‘precisely tagged’ homes.Over as brief a time-span as just a couple of months.ENWRAPTUREIn more visceral modes of advertising, such as that for food and drink, framingand logical inference often part company completely. Here, the corporatemachinations of spin hit directly on neurophysiology – precipitating sneaky,unconscious shifts in low-level sensory perception. Take the drinks industry,for instance. Cheskin, a market research organisation based in Redwood Shores,California, experimented with different coloured backgrounds on cans of 7-Up.Some cans were more yellow. Others more green. In both cases, the beverageinside was the same. If customers hadn’t gone nuts, bosses back at 7-Up HQ mightwell have seen the funny side. Those who purchased the yellow cans reported anunfamiliar ‘lemony’ flavour to the contents, while those who bought the greencans complained – you got it – of too much lime in the mix.‘8 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn8]When we decide in the blink ofan eye whether or not food tastes good,’ says Cheskin CEO Darryl K. Rhea, ‘we’rereacting not only to the evidence from our taste buds and salivary glands, butalso to the evidence of our eyes, memories and imaginations.’David Deal, creative director at Deal Design Group in San Diego, agrees. Imagineyou’re throwing a party. We’ve all done it – grabbed a bottle of vodka we’venever even seen before retailing at £30, when sitting there right next to it isa more familiar brand for £10. But why? Do we really think we’re going to tastethe difference? I don’t think so. To me, vodka tastes of nothing. Can nothing –even at £30 a bottle – be made to taste of something?Deal’s got the answer – and it has nothing to do with taste. Instead, it’s aboutfeel. About what’s known, in the trade, as emotional branding.‘9 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn9]They’re selling you theexperience of being at a chic party and drinking a martini made with vodka thatwas carved out of ice in the depths of Finland,’ he explains. ‘If you put abeautiful bottle next to a consumer, they’ll say it contributes to the taste.’Which explains, according to Washington-based industry group Point-Of-PurchaseAdvertising International, why up to 72 per cent of our purchase choices aremade right there and then. On the spot. Spontaneously. And why a simple changeof colour, or a wrong choice of word, can just as easily turn us off a brand ason to it.British entrepreneur Gerald Ratner, founder of Ratner’s jewellery chain in theUK, famously watched his multimillion-pound business go down the drain after adisastrous quip at a meeting of the Institute of Directors. Ratner – the aptlynamed Sultan of Bling – offered the following, canny insight into why the stuffin his shops was so cheap.‘Because it’s crap.’He further elucidated – astutely, eloquently, and with terminal disregard forthe art of obfuscation – on the quality of some of his earrings: ‘… cheaper thanan M & S prawn sandwich but probably wouldn’t last as long’.Ratner’s shares plummeted. Not because some dark, elusive secret had finallyslipped out. (Anyone who didn’t already know that 18-carat gold,diamond-encrusted watches usually went for more than £19.99 needed their headstested.)No. It wasn’t because everybody suddenly knew that what they were buying wascrap.It was because everybody suddenly knew that everybody else knew that what theywere buying was crap.GIVE AND TAKEFraming and anchoring are just two of the techniques that can increasepersuasive power. There are others – as ‘cold caller’ Pat Reynolds knows onlytoo well.In his first week of joining a telesales company, Pat Reynolds chuckedeverything he’d been taught into a big file called ‘bollocks’ (his words, notmine) and instead developed his own, somewhat unique, style of sales pitch. Overthe last few years this pitch has earned him a BMW Z4 Roadster, a pilot’slicence for a light aircraft (not cheap), and a substantial down payment on anapartment. The company he works for deals in building and renovation work. Hissecret? A demonic combination of making people laugh – while, at the same time,actively courting rejection. Here, in Pat’s own words, is how it works:People call it cold calling but if I do my job properly only one in ten callsare really cold. I begin by making them laugh. ‘Are you superstitious?’ is oneof the things I ask. If someone rang you up out of the blue and asked you that,you’d be curious, right? At least, you’d be less likely to put the phone downthan if I said, ‘This is Joe Bloggs calling from such and such.’That’s the first key. You’ve got to keep them on the line. You can’t sellanything to a dial tone. So most people say no, they’re not superstitious. Sothen I say, ‘Well, will you give me £13.13?’ Nine times out of ten this gets areaction. Usually they laugh and say, ‘Who is this?’And then I’m in. But I don’t try to sell them anything. That’s a no-brainer. Ido the total opposite. I say, ‘Look, I know you want to watch EastEnders (orCoronation Street, it’s good to call around a quarter of an hour before thesoaps start so you can use that line: it makes them think you’re just like them,always good for a sale) ‘and I know you probably don’t really want any buildingwork done, but do you know anyone – any friends, or family, or friends offriends – who might?’Because I’ve made them laugh, and because they also think I’ve done them afavour by letting them off the hard sell, they usually give me a couple of namesor ask me to ring back after they’ve made some calls. And I make a point ofasking them if that’s OK. I say, ‘Is it OK if I call you back?’ And they say,‘Yes.’ Sounds trivial but that’s important. It makes it like a contract. Kind ofcements the deal – like a verbal handshake.Great, isn’t it? After only two or three minutes on the phone, they’re workingfor me! Maybe I should think about giving them a cut. So the next call you makeisn’t really cold any more. It’s a referral. One good turn deserves another andall that …Strictly speaking, Pat Reynolds belongs in the previous chapter[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c03_r1.htm]. Or does he? I can’t make up my mindwhether he’s a first-rate conman or just extraordinarily good at what he does.Maybe it’s a bit of both. Whichever it is, his strategy for drumming up businessbrings to the table a completely new style of framing – a virus not ofattention, but of approach. A virus as endemic to the sales industry as it is,unfortunately, to my better half: emotional blackmail.In sales (as opposed to marriage), emotional blackmail needs to be subtle.Preaching, lecturing, pleading and bullying are about as useful in the showroomas a snooze button on a smoke alarm. Instead, just like Pat Reynolds, thesuccessful salesperson treads carefully.Just look, for a moment, at the way Reynolds operates. For all his bravado androguish streetwise charm, he’s a serious player. Not everyone who works in acall centre learns to fly on the proceeds. Nor do they roll off a gleaminggarage forecourt in a top-of-the-range convertible. He makes an awful lot ofmoney where an awful lot of people simply go under. And how? By reverting tofirst principles. To a time when persuasion had yet to hit on language. Byreleasing from the depths of human evolution one of the most powerful genies ofinfluence known to man: the principle of reciprocity.10 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn10]Robert Cialdini, Regents’Professor of Psychology and Marketing at Arizona State University, has shownprecisely how powerful the pull of reciprocity is, how rightful its place in thearsenal of the elite persuader, in a study that (on the surface, at least)looked at individual differences in altruism. In fact, it was really aboutcompliance.Here’s how it worked. First, Cialdini and his colleagues stopped randompassers-by in the street and divided them up into two groups. Each group wasthen posed a question. Those in the first group were asked how willing theywould be to supervise a cohort of inmates from a juvenile detention centre on aday trip to the zoo. Oddly enough, few of them were interested. Just 17 percent. For those in the second group, however, the furniture of influence wassubtly rearranged. These participants were first asked a rather differentquestion: Would they consider putting in two hours a week as a volunteercounsellor at the detention centre for the next couple of years? This time,surprise, surprise, there were no takers at all.But then something rather spooky happened.When Cialdini and his co-investigators responded to such refusals with therejoinder, ‘OK, if you’re not willing to be a counsellor would you be preparedto supervise a cohort of inmates from a juvenile detention centre on a day tripto the zoo?’ – precisely the same question as that put to the first group –agreement to the request shot up to 50 per cent. It pretty much tripled theprevious consent rate.Of course, it doesn’t take a genius to work out what’s going on here. The powerof reciprocity, concluded Cialdini, extends far beyond the distribution of giftsand favours. It may also be applied to the kinds of concessions we make to oneanother. If you reject my larger request and I, ostensibly, make a concession byretreating from that larger request to a smaller one, then you’re likely toconcede in kind by ‘meeting me halfway’.Which means, if what I’ve been after all along is merely your agreement to thesmaller request, that I’ve got what I wanted. Right?CONTRACTS OF MINDPat Reynolds’ deployment of the reciprocity principle is, from a scientificperspective, little short of perfection. He couldn’t execute better were he,like Cialdini & Co., part of a carefully controlled psychology experiment.Because he spares his ‘customers’ the hard sell – empathising with theirpredicament of being called up just as their favourite TV soap is about tostart, and asking ‘considerately’, apologetically even, if they might know ofanyone else who’d be interested in his services – they feel obligated to givehim a name. What they conveniently overlook (from Reynolds’ point of view) isthat, far from being chivalrous, he’s actually a pain in the arse; the chef decuisine of a two-tiered trifle of torment: calling them up in the first place,and then, during the commercial break or whenever, prising them out of theirarmchairs to ransack address books and rummage around for contacts.And the story doesn’t end there. Reciprocity, it turns out, isn’t the only virusof approach that Reynolds incubates in his clientele. There’s another: cognitiveconsistency. The impromptu request for permission to call back later is, asReynolds himself points out, nowhere near as casual as it seems. Far from it.It’s an ancient manoeuvre of pure, primaeval persuasion. A trigger, shouldpermission to call back be granted, for the client to stick to their word – tohonour their side of the ‘bargain’ and dutifully drum up business.And it works. Quickly. Covertly. Sub-cortically. In fact, to complianceconnoisseurs, reciprocity plus consistency is a pretty standard concoction. Thetwo ingredients often go hand in hand. If the evolutionary origins ofreciprocity may be traced to the division of labour and the facilitation ofin-group cohesion (hunting, transporting large objects, and constructingshelters all involve teamwork), then the psychological properties of consistencyand commitment may be seen as a kind of ‘entry card’ to such inclusion. Theseare the attributes that ensure dependability. That signal to the group that weare as good as our word.11 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn11]Just how much influence thedesire to appear consistent can wield over our behaviour, and just howpersuasive someone can become if they contrive to hack into such ancientevolutionary frequencies, may be seen from the following: a dazzling example ofsubterranean persuasion from Chicago restaurateur Gordon Sinclair. In thelate-nineties, Sinclair was having trouble with no-shows. It’s something thatevery restaurateur has to deal with, one of the real downsides of the business –a customer makes a booking over the telephone and then, without prior warning,fails to turn up. As things stood at the time, the no-call/no-show rate inSinclair’s restaurant hovered around 30 per cent. But, at a stroke, he slashedit to 10.The key to the problem, Sinclair discovered, lay in what his receptionist saidon the telephone. Or, more accurately perhaps, what she didn’t say. Prior tointervention, the receptionist, whenever a customer called to make a booking,would issue the following INSTRUCTION: Please call if you have to change yourplans.Subsequent to intervention, however, she amended this slightly to the followingsimple REQUEST: WILL YOU please call if you have to change your plans?And then she would pause and wait for the caller to answer.Just those two extra words, plus that all-important pause, changed the wholescale of the problem.Why?Because the question begged an answer, and the silence – as all silences do overthe telephone – needed filling. By answering ‘Yes’ to the question, ‘Will youplease call if you have to change your plans?’, callers were handing themselvesa memorable psychological grid-reference: a contractual landmark on which to fixa bearing. Future action suddenly became illuminated by previous commitment.And, once committed, the locus of responsibility subtly shifted. Rather thanface the prospect of letting just the restaurant down, customers now faced theprospect of letting themselves down too.12 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn12]Sinclair’s technique has a namein the influence literature – foot-in-the-door – and was officially unveiledback in 1966 in an experiment so outlandish that the researchers, JonathanFreedman and Scott Fraser, achieved a rare feat in the annals of scientificenquiry: they dumbfounded even themselves. The ball started rolling in a smart,affluent neighbourhood of Palo Alto, California. An associate of theresearchers, posing as a volunteer worker, began knocking on doors and assailingresidents with a quite extraordinary proposal: the erection, slap bang in themiddle of their front lawns, of a gargantuan public-service billboard depictingthe words DRIVE CAREFULLY.To facilitate the decision-making process, residents were shown a picture of theset-up – where it would go, how it would look – and it wasn’t pretty. Thebillboard was as big as the house, and took up most of the lawn. Notsurprisingly, most of them (73 per cent) told the researchers, in no uncertainterms, exactly what they could do with it. And that wasn’t pretty either.Except, that is, for one particular group: 76 per cent of which actuallyacquiesced to the installation of the billboard. Can you believe that? Neithercould I when I read it. So what was so special about this one particular group?Were they mad? Were they bribed? What could have induced them to take such leaveof their senses? To pack up their sprinklers and kiss their hydrangeas goodbye?The answer is actually very simple. Two weeks prior to the visit about thebillboard, a different ‘volunteer’ had also appeared at their doors. On thisoccasion, however, the request had been relatively harmless: the placing, inresidents’ front windows, of a three-inch square sign bearing the words, BE ASAFE DRIVER. No problem there whatsoever. In fact, so insignificant had beenthis request, and so in tune with neighbourly sentiment, that almost everyoneapproached had consented.Yet how costly it had proved in the long run. That one insignificant request –once agreed to and long-since forgotten – had initiated the ripples of amurderous commitment tsunami; had precipitated acquiescence to a consonant, yetfar greater, demand that awaited them just round the corner: the subsequentdisplay of a billboard a hundred times bigger.Double-glazing salesmen the world over suddenly sat up and took notice. The catwas now out of the bag – sporting snakeskin boots and a beat-up, ten-gallon hat.To get a person to sign away their life, you do it a day at a time.HARD TO GET13 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn13]In sales, a related techniqueto that of foot-in-the-door is known as low-balling. I first encounteredlow-balling in a job I took as a student selling televisions. The routine wouldgo as follows. Customer ambles in through door and shuffles up to Set. Assistant– quite possibly me – approaches Customer and, after preliminary small talkabout Weather, offers them a Deal. Deal considerably undercuts those offered byother showrooms in the neighbourhood and Customer jumps at it. But Manager hasother ideas. Unbeknownst to Customer he has no intention of honouring it. Noneof us do. Not at the price initially quoted, at any rate. It’s a lure. A pieceof psychological stage magic to entice Customer to decide to make the purchase.But this is just for starters. There then ensues the Byzantine Closing Ritual –procedures designed for no other reason than to make the decision stick: thecompletion of Complicated Contract; the talking through (as exhaustively aspossible) of Labyrinthine Financial Agreement; and the generous encouragement ofCustomer – ‘Try it, you’ll like it’ – to take the television home for a trialperiod: ‘Just to see if it fits in with the decor, you know, that sort ofthing.’ Which, of course, it does. Eleven times out of ten.Can you see what’s happening here? The greater the number of hoops the customeris made to jump through, the greater becomes their commitment to the cause. Aparticular favourite of the bastard I used to work for was to find out how manyforms of ID the customer had on them in the shop, and then to insist,irrespective of how many it turned out to be, that they still required oneextra: ‘With the increase in security, it’s the law.’1Undeterred by this additional encumbrance – indeed, spurred on by the generousterms agreed at the outset – the customer would then be despatched to procurethe requisite documentation, none the wiser that at the very moment they walkedout of the shop, free will hurled itself under the wheels of an impendingdirect-debit agreement.Inevitably, of course, somewhere along the line, something would then ‘come up’.The original price did not include tax; I, or some other bungling member of thesales team had ‘made a mistake’ which the manager – ‘Sorry, my hands are tied’ –just couldn’t allow to stand. But do you think it made any difference? Put adent in our chances of closing? Did it hell. In the overwhelming majority ofcases the customer would still walk away with the television even when the priceceased to be competitive and actually rose above that offered by othershowrooms. Every dotted line, every extra form of ID, every smile, everyhandshake, made it more and more worth having.In the end, the thought of getting their hands on that television was the onlything left in many customers’ minds. They couldn’t, for want of a better phrase,switch it off.LINGUISTIC ASSASSINATIONMary, a pious do-gooder and local church gossip, was always sticking her noseinto other people’s business. She wasn’t overly popular with the other churchmembers, but she had a formidable reputation and no one wanted to mess with her.One day, however, after noticing his pickup van parked outside a bar, sheaccused Bill, a newcomer, of having a drink problem. Indeed, at the church’snext committee meeting she made it quite clear, to Bill and to everyone else,that it was an open-and-shut case: anyone who saw his van parked there wouldknow exactly what he was up to. What other explanation could there be?Bill, a man of few words, looked at her for a moment, and then left. He made noattempt to explain himself, nor did he deny that what Mary had seen was true. Hesaid nothing.Later that evening, Bill quietly parked his van in front of Mary’s house. Andleft it there all night.Language evolved as an aid to communication. But now that we’ve got it have youever noticed how it’s often the things we don’t say that turn out to be mostimportant? How, in the right – or, indeed, wrong – hands just the one word(sometimes less!), discreetly and expertly placed, can make all the difference?The American political drama The West Wing once featured an episode in which theDemocrats wanted to call Arnold Vinick (the Republican candidate for President)old. The problem, however, was that they didn’t want to do so directly. Anovert, premeditated attack on Vinick’s advancing years would not only have beencounter-productive to Democrat nominee Matt Santos’ campaign, there was also thedanger that it might not have ‘stuck’. What to do?The solution comes in a brief but hilarious dialogue between Lou (Santos’Director of Communications) and Josh (his Deputy Chief of Staff). Havingrejected the irony of labeling Vinick ‘vigorous’, Lou, without thinking, refersto him as ‘spry’. Inconveniently spry, for Santos’ political ambitions. Joshseizes on the opportunity. Whoever heard of anyone under the age of seventybeing called ‘spry’, he muses? Though, on the face of it, flattering, spry isjust one of those words: what the large print giveth the small print takethaway. It says ‘old guy versus young guy’ without so much as the slightest nod toage – the perfect disguise for a pop at the Republican feeb!Words like ‘spry’ are great, aren’t they? They say one thing, but allude tosomething completely different. Josh is right. While technically a compliment,spry is a label that is really only applied to the elderly. And so, as such, isexactly what Matt Santos’ campaign team are looking for. By referring to ArnoldVinick as ‘spry’ (in much the same way that Barack Obama referred to JohnMcCain’s ‘half century of service’ in the run-up to the 2009 US election), theycan draw the public’s attention to their opponent’s age, while at the same timeappearing even-handed: a backhanded insult and political gifthorse in one.14 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn14]In 1946, Solomon Asch – whosework on conformity we encountered in the previous chapter[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c03_r1.htm] – demonstrated precisely the power oflanguage to colour our social perception in a study now regarded as the classicin the way we form impressions. First, Asch presented participants with a listof trait-descriptions. These descriptions all related – supposedly, at least –to the same individual. But there was a catch. Prior to drawing up the list hedivided the participants into two groups – and then adjusted the listaccordingly so that each group received exactly the same descriptions but forone (as it turned out, crucial) variation.One group were presented with the following list …intelligent, skilful, industrious, warm, determined, practical, cautious … while the second group received this one …intelligent, skilful, industrious, cold, determined, practical, cautious.Spot the difference? The lists are indistinguishable except for the words ‘warm’and ‘cold’ fiendishly sandwiched in the middle of either one.Having been allocated their respective lists, Asch then asked both groups to usethe descriptions to guide them in their choice of further traits – selected froma supplementary list – which they considered ‘went’ with the personality profileinitially presented.Would the inclusion of the simple ‘warm-cold’ differential, Asch wanted to know,be sufficient to cause a disparity in each group’s choice of attributes?The answer, without a shadow of doubt, was yes.The group that received the ‘warm’ list co-opted, from the supplementaryinventory of traits, descriptions such as ‘happy’ and ‘generous’.In contrast, however, the group that received the ‘cold’ list selected traitssuch as ‘calculating’ and ‘unsympathetic’: unflattering, to say the least,compared to their virtually identical counterparts.2LIVING IN OUR OWN LITTLE WORDSA man is walking through the zoo one day when he sees a little girl leaning intothe African Lion’s cage. Suddenly, the lion grabs the little girl by her jacketand tries to pull her inside. Her parents start screaming hysterically.The man runs to the cage, and whacks the lion on the nose with his umbrella.Whimpering from the pain, the lion retreats and lets go of the little girl. Theman reunites her with her parents – who thank him repeatedly for saving theirdaughter’s life.Unbeknownst to the man, a journalist has been watching what happened.‘Sir,’ he says, walking up to him afterwards, ‘that was the bravest thing I eversaw in my life.’The man shrugs.‘It was nothing,’ he says. ‘The lion was in a cage and I knew God would protectme, just as He protected Daniel in the lion’s den. When I saw the little girlwas in danger, I just did what I thought was right.’The reporter is gobsmacked.‘Is that a Bible I see in your pocket?’ he asks.‘Yes,’ says the man. ‘I’m a Christian. In fact, I’m on my way to Bible classright now.’‘I’m a journalist,’ replies the reporter. ‘And you know what? I’m going to runwhat you did on tomorrow’s front page. I’m going to make absolutely certain thatyour selfless act of heroism doesn’t go unnoticed.’The following morning the man buys the paper.The headline reads as follows: Right-wing Christian Fundamentalist AssaultsAfrican Immigrant and Steals His Lunch.Words, it should be becoming clear by now, are psycho-active. Taken aurally orvisually and delivered to the brain in milliseconds, they can modify our thoughtpatterns and influence the way we approach situations just as fast as anythingwe may be able to pick up on a street corner.In the media, for example, the right kind of word can grab our attention, canfire our emotions, just as easily as the biggest billboard. A case in point isthe rise of political correctness. 15[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn15]In 2005, the Global LanguageMonitor – a nonprofit organisation that does exactly what its name suggests –issued a tongue-in-cheek list of the year’s most politically correct words andphrases. Top of this list was the term ‘misguided criminals’ – an eleganteuphemism rustled up by a BBC commentator in the wake of the London bus and tubebombings. Over 50 innocent civilians had perished in the blast. But‘terrorists’, apparently, was deemed just too emotive.Also on the list were the terms ‘thought shower’ which, in deference to thosewith epilepsy, had apparently, on one occasion, replaced ‘brainstorm’. And‘deferred success’ which on another had substituted for ‘failure’. Then, ofcourse, there was ‘womyn’.It’s difficult in the face of such buffoonery to countenance the possibilitythat there may be a serious side to all of this. Yet there is. In the lawcourts, for instance, the hypnotic potential of language is recognised only toowell as an impish impediment to justice. This is precisely the reason why, incross-examination, ‘leading’ questions are so vehemently overruled.16 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn16]A classic study conducted in1974 by Elizabeth Loftus of the University of Washington and her colleague JohnPalmer provides clear evidence as to why this should continue to be the case.The centrepiece of the study comprised a video clip of a minor road trafficaccident – a moving car making contact with a stationary one – which Loftus andPalmer played to two groups of participants. After they’d watched the video, theresearchers then posed the same question to each group. At what speed did themoving car run into the parked one? Surprisingly, in spite of the fact that bothgroups had seen exactly the same clip, they gave radically different answers.The response of one group (averaged across its members) was 31.8 m.p.h., whereasthat of the other group (similarly averaged) was 40.5 m.p.h.3 How could this be?The reason, of course, was simple. On posing the question, Loftus and Palmerused subtly different wording.Of one group they asked: ‘At what speed did Car 1 contact Car 2?’While of the other group they asked: ‘At what speed did Car 1 smash into Car 2?’That insidious one-word disparity between the two questions made all thedifference to the answers. Not only that, but those witnesses who’d been askedabout the smash reported glimpsing broken glass at the scene of the accident –even though, in the original video clip, there wasn’t any. No wonder that‘leading the witness’ elicits such urgent and vociferous objections.But it’s not just in the courtroom that we need to be on our guard. Similareffects to those documented by Loftus and Palmer are also found in politics. AsI write, Barack Obama’s honeymoon period as President On Fire is well and trulyover. He didn’t go to Berlin for the 20th anniversary of the wall coming down.Has become too preoccupied with health care reform – and too blasé aboutunemployment. Bowed too low before the Japanese Emperor. And permitted theChinese President to bar questions at their joint press conference. Democrats,of course, traditionally have a hard first year in office. In politics, theworst kind of devil is the one that’s in the detail – and of the past sevenPresidents, Bushes I and II rank top in popularity after their inaugural year inpower, and Clinton and Obama bottom. Moreover, you might ask, which US Presidentever got anything out of the Chinese? Yet Obama, even before he came to theWhite House, wasn’t averse to throwing the odd political curveball. During theelection campaign of 2008, records show that despite enjoying near unanimoussupport from African Americans in the polls, he steadfastly resisted all effortsto label himself as a ‘black candidate’.‘I reject a politics that is based solely on racial identity, gender identity,sexual orientation or victimhood generally,’ Obama asserts in The Audacity ofHope – a line he took right from the very beginning of his campaign.But why? Why, when you have the overwhelming backing of a significant portion ofthe population, not take advantage of your ethnicity? Appeal to the sense ofhistory that hunkers down in all of us?The answer, as Time columnist David von Drehle rightly points out, is that‘black’ is just one of those words. One of those ‘central traits’ like ‘warm’and ‘cold’ that Solomon Asch first started playing around with back in theforties.‘17 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn17]As soon as the race label isadded,’ writes von Drehle, ‘some of the audience tunes out, others are turnedoff and still others leap to conclusions about who you are and how you think.Obama has written that race was his “obsession” growing up but that he long agoleft that burden behind. Now he lays claim to the whole spectrum: “the son of ablack man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas” with “brothers, sisters,nieces, nephews, uncles and cousins, of every race and every hue, scatteredacross three continents”.’True, maybe. But expedient as well.BOTTOM LINEFrank Luntz, who we met earlier in this chapter, runs focus groups specificallydesigned to unlock the power of language. To uncover the perfect phrase – agolden word, or grouping of words, whose meaning remains untarnished byinterpretation. The zeitgeist zinger that says exactly what voters hear – aswell as what the politicians want them to hear. A semantic chord that resonatesprecision.Luntz is a linguistic scuba diver – a pirate of the idiomatic unconscious.First, he throws out buzzwords – key political terms or familiar, topicalsoundbites – to which members of his focus groups free-associate. Thesefree-associations factorise into second-order words or phrases that then formthe basis of subsequent group discussion. From these discussions, Luntzfiltrates a third generation of words. Then, after further rounds of debate, afourth or a fifth. The eventual result is a distillate of meaning several timesremoved from the word or phrase originally presented, yet deeply imbued withprimal connotation. A new word or phrase that means, quite literally, what itsays.18 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c04-ftn18]Back in 2000, New Yorkercorrespondent Nicholas Lemann attended one of Frank Luntz’s focus groups andwitnessed first-hand his trademark linguistic alchemy. The show kicked off withthe word ‘government’. What, Luntz asked those present, did that word mean tothem? Responses – at first – were nothing to write home about. ‘Controlling’,‘laws’, ‘security’, ‘bureaucracy’, ‘corruption’ … no surprises there. Then oneof the assembled, a general contractor, blurted out the following: ‘A lot ofregulations … a lot of stuff that I don’t need to put up with. They could leaveme alone a little bit. I would be a bigger company if I could have two things: alittle less law, and a little more help.’Bam! Things had just kicked up a notch. Here was something that Luntz couldreally run with – and with a judo-master’s skill for spotting that crucialopening, he seized on it.He turned to the rest of the group. ‘What’s your reaction to that?’ he askedthem.A little while later, after a prolonged invective against laws, politicians, and– hey – the whole Washington thing in general, he was chalking up five key wordson an easel. Opportunity. Community. Responsibility. Accountability. Society.Luntz probed deeper. When the group reflected on their core values, the thingsthat really mattered to them in their lives, which of the five was the mostimportant? A show of hands quickly revealed the answer. Opportunity came out ontop. Accountability second. And community last.But what, exactly, did that word ‘opportunity’ mean to people? Luntz asked.As the group yelled out answers – ‘right to choose’, ‘personal control’, ‘noobstacles’, ‘everyone gets a chance’, ‘founding principle of the country’ – hehauled a fresh sheet of paper on to the easel.Once again, a pecking order was established as the relative importance of thesecore atoms of democracy, these mitochondria of liberty, was put to the vote.This time, ‘founding principle’ won gold, ‘everyone gets a chance’ got silver,and ‘right to choose’ the bronze.Luntz then turned to Lemann.‘You have the Republican and Democratic definitions of opportunity right there,’he pronounced. ‘The Republican is ‘right to choose’ and the Democratic is‘everyone gets a chance’. Individual versus global.’Luntz’s philosophy is, of course, hardly new. In the early 1900s it was TheodoreRoosevelt who first articulated the benefits of mindreading in the politicalarena. ‘The most successful politician,’ Roosevelt observed, ‘is he who sayswhat the people are thinking most often in the loudest voice.’ Or, as someoneelse more succinctly put it: the best way to ride a horse is in the direction inwhich it is going. But what Luntz does do is drag Roosevelt into the modern era,using political insight and discursive psychology as a backstage pass to thebrain; as a linguistic MRI scan of affective, semantic form – revealing thehairline fractures and microscopic lesions to which all communication issubject.Take the phrase ‘oil drilling’, for instance. If you think it couldn’t beclearer, think again. In 2007, Luntz got a group of people together and showedthem a picture of a deep-sea drilling project at Katrina, on the Gulf of Mexico.He then asked the group how they viewed the picture. Did it ‘look likeexploration or drilling?’ Incredibly, 90 per cent of those questioned said itlooked like exploration.‘If the public says after looking at the pictures, “that doesn’t look like mydefinition of drilling, it looks like my definition of exploring”,’ Luntzargued, ‘then don’t you think we should be calling it what people see it to be,rather than adding a political aspect to it all? … Drilling suggests that oil ispouring into the ocean. In Katrina, not a single drop of oil spilled in the Gulfof Mexico from the rigs themselves. That’s why deep-sea exploration is a moreappropriate term.’Back in 2002 – at a time, by his own admission, when the scientific evidence wasperhaps not as compelling as it is now – Luntz prescribed a similar kind ofrehab for the term ‘global warming’. In a memo to George W. Bush entitled ‘TheEnvironment: A Cleaner, Safer, Healthier America’, he wrote as follows:The scientific debate is closing [against us] but not yet closed. There is stilla window of opportunity to challenge the science … Voters believe that there isno consensus about global warming within the scientific community. Should thepublic come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views aboutglobal warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to makethe lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate, and defer toscientists and other experts in the field.Result? Global warming slipped into something more comfortable. Something lessalarmist, less loaded – and, politically at least, more savvy.Something – you may have heard of it – called ‘climate change’.4SUMMARYThis chapter, in theme if not in content, follows on pretty much from where weleft off in Chapter 3 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c03_r1.htm]. There, if yourecall, psychopathic genius and natural born persuader Keith Barrett introducedus to what he referred to as the Three As of social influence – attention,approach, and affiliation – and we examined how his typology, gleaned from alifetime of thinking on his feet, stood up to the rigours of scientificscrutiny. Not too badly, as it turned out.Here, in Chapter 4 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c04_r1.htm], we opened the door abit wider. We stepped out of the shadows and into the world of the workplace,and looked at how the ‘persuasion grandmasters’ – this time those on the rightside of the law – go about their business. How lawyers, politicians, advertisersand sales people gain access to our thought streams – and subtly divert theircourse.Our survey proved revealing. The brain employs some pretty simple house rules –and if you know how to bend them, persuasion jackpots aren’t so hard to hit.In the following chapter, we continue our tour of the casino of social influenceby going ‘up’ a level – from the individual to the group. Suggestion and framingmay well take free will to the cleaners, but it’s what others are doing thatoften walks off with the pot.In the days of our ancestors, safety in numbers was vital – and that ancientevolutionary imperative is glacially preserved in our brains.1 Sometimes it got silly. One guy had six, for God’s sake.2 This is a study that you can easily perform on your friends. The complete listof supplementary trait adjectives used by Asch in the original version of histask is provided in Appendix 2 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm3_r1.htm]. Try theoriginal version first and then experiment by varying the content of both theprimary (e.g. warm/cold) and secondary (e.g. intelligent, practical) trait liststo see which descriptions really do make a difference.3 The actual speed with which the moving car made contact with the stationaryone was 12 m.p.h.4 It should be noted that Luntz has since attempted to distance himself from theBush administration policy, and now accepts that humans have indeed had a directimpact on global warming."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5PERSUASION BY NUMBERSAn old Irish man is lying on his deathbed, with his son sitting by his side. Theold man looks up at him, and says, ‘Son, it’s time for you to get me aProtestant minister.’The son is incredulous. ‘But, Dad!’ he protests. ‘You’ve been a staunch Catholicall your life! You’re delirious. It’s a priest you’ll be wanting now, not aminister.’The old smiles weakly, and shakes his head. ‘Son, please,’ he says. ‘It’s mylast request. Get a minister for me!’‘But, Dad,’ cries the son, ‘you’ve been a good Catholic all your life. Youraised ME as a good Catholic. You don’t want a minister at a time like this!’The old man won’t budge.‘Son,’ he whispers, ‘if you respect me and love me as a father, you’ll go outand get me a Protestant minister right now.’The son relents and does what his father asks of him. Then he and the ministercome back to the house, and the minister goes upstairs and converts the old man.As the minister is leaving the house, he passes Father O’Sullivan rushing inthrough the door. Inwardly delighted, he stares solemnly into the eyes of thepriest.‘I’m afraid you’re too late, Father,’ he says. ‘He’s a Protestant now.’Father O’Sullivan bounds up the stairs and bursts into the old man’s room.‘Seamus! Seamus! Why did you do it?’ he cries. ‘You were such a good Catholic!We went to St Mary’s together! You were there when I performed my first Mass!Why in the world would you do such a thing like this?’The old man gazes intently at his friend.‘Well, Patrick,’ he says, ‘I figured if somebody had to go, it was better one ofTHEM than one of US.’‘We allow our ignorance to prevail upon us and make us think we can survivealone, alone in patches, alone in groups, alone in races, even alone in genders’– Maya Angelou, address to Centenary College of Louisiana, March 1990.TALL ORDERI arrived at London City airport to a scene of total chaos. A complete systemsfailure meant that everyone was being checked in manually and the usuallyexpansive concourse was packed with queues so geometrically double-jointed evenStephen Hawking would have marvelled. No one, at this airport, was goinganywhere fast. In fact some weren’t going anywhere at all.A guy a little bit ahead of me was spoiling for a fight. He’d already soundedoff a couple of times on his phone, and had finally had enough. He marched – orrather, minced – right up to the front of the queue, threw down his Prada cabinbag, and demanded that he be checked in immediately. The assistant wasunimpressed.Slowly getting out of her chair, she climbed, very methodically, on top of hercounter – and stood up. Then, in a loud, measured, and exquisitely disdainfultone, she addressed him from on high.‘What makes you think that you should be treated any differently to anyone elseat this airport?’He never made the flight.In the last chapter we examined in some detail the dynamics of what we mightcall cognitive suggestion. How the grand masters of professional persuasion, thelawyers, the salespeople, the ad men and the politicians, are able to manipulatenot just the kind of information that our brains take in (the raw material ofinfluence), but also precisely what we do with that information once we’ve gotit. But stories like those of the check-in assistant allude to a different kindof influence to that discussed so far – an influence that feeds not so much onthe power of information as on the pull of human relations.Take what happened in Jonestown, for instance. On 18 November 1978 the ReverendJim Jones tape-recorded a 44-minute message instructing over 900 members of thePeople’s Temple to drink cyanide-laced Koolaid in a remote agriculturalcommunity in the jungle of north-western Guyana. The carnage that followedremains, to this day, the greatest single loss of American civilian life apartfrom 9/11.1Then there was London, five years ago. On 7 July 2005, at 8.50 a.m., a primaryschool teacher, a carpet-fitter, and a fish and chip shop assistant caused aseries of explosions in the bustling city centre that obliterated, in coldblood, the lives of 39 people who were on their way to work. Barely one hourlater, at 9.47, a fourth member of the death squad – eighteen years old and justout of school – contrived to set off another device, bringing the tally ofdevastation to 52.Needless to say, these are extremes. Examples of group influence – ofradicalisation and brainwashing – so far removed from everyday experience thatthey appear, to all but a crazed minority, beyond comprehension. Which in manyways they are. Yet they, too, bear the thumbprints of persuasion – ancientforces of interpersonal attraction that lash together identities. They comprisea spectrum of influence ranging from simple changes of mind at the one end, towholesale shifts in worldview at the other. From the trifling affairs ofday-to-day subsistence to matters of life and death.Cast your mind back, for instance, to Solomon Asch and his ‘line study’ in theprevious chapter [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c04_r1.htm]. It was obvious, if youremember, which of those lines were the same length and which were not. But adda few dissenters to the mix – confident, consistent, unanimous dissenters – andthings became trickier. Participants began to see the lines not as they were,but as those around them saw them.And that – when ideologies start getting involved, when the lines turn intodogma – is when it all begins to get dangerous.CONVICTION BY NUMBERS1 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn1]Just how easy it is to radicalisea group of moderate – though partisan – individuals is revealed by research intosomething called group polarisation. Group polarisation describes what happensto individuals’ opinions when they form part of a group. They become moreextreme.2 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn2]This is something you candemonstrate for yourself with the help of a few friends. First, ask them to giveyou their individual opinions – in private – on an issue such as the following.An undercover agent operating behind enemy lines gets taken prisoner byopposition forces and is sentenced to 20 years’ hard labour in a remotedetention centre. Conditions at the centre are extremely bad, and the chance ofrescue minuscule. The agent ponders his predicament – that he will spend theprime of his life in abject, interminable misery – and begins to formulate anescape plan. But if his attempt is foiled and he is recaptured, he will beexecuted.Question: If you were advising the agent, what would you consider the acceptablelevel of risk beyond which an escape attempt should not be made? Select from thefollowing options (numbers on the scale represent the probability of beingcaught: i.e. the chance of capture varies from 10 per cent on the left to 90 percent on the right):[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_031_r1.jpg]Once your friends have provided their individual opinions, bring them togetherfor stage 2. This time, you tell them, they must discuss the same issue as agroup, at the end of which they must arrive at a joint recommendation.What you’ll find is this. If the average of the individual opinions comes out asbeing less than 5/10 (i.e. if it veers towards caution), then the group decisionwill shift further in that direction (i.e. it will be more conservative than thesum of the individual recommendations). If, on the other hand, the average ofthe individual opinions comes out as being greater than 5/10 (i.e. if it veerstowards risk), then the group decision will shift further in that direction(i.e. it will be riskier than the sum of the individual recommendations).3 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn3]The effects of group polarisationhave been studied in all sorts of settings – from racetracks and shopping mallsto the decision-making processes of burglars. In each case, findings exhibitprecisely the same pattern. Venture out as a group and you’ll spend more moneyin the stores. Venture out as a group and you’ll burgle … fewer houses.(Burglars, when performing collective assessments of a site’s vulnerability,tend to be risk averse by nature.)But it’s in relation to prejudice – and, more recently, the rise of extremism –that the most important work has been done. 4[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn4]Research has shown that whenprejudiced individuals come together to discuss issues of race, their attitudesharden and they become more prejudiced. Low-prejudice individuals, on the otherhand, become more tolerant:[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_032_r1.jpg]Figure 5.1 – Group Polarisation and Prejudice. (photo credit 5.1)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c05-fig1a]The recruitment tactics employed by many terrorist organisations work alongsimilar lines. The process begins with the targeting of sympathetic individuals(often, at first, through mainstream ideology) who are then brought together inpartisan group settings to absorb propaganda and to discuss ‘the cause’.Twenty-two-year-old Shehzad Tanweer was described by his friends as politicallymoderate. At school in England he showed promise as a sportsman: as a cricketer,footballer and long-distance runner. In 2004 he graduated from LeedsMetropolitan University with a degree in sports science, then enrolled on acourse of ‘Islamic studies’ in Pakistan: in a madrasa, in Lahore, withconnections – intelligence sources now believe – to an outlawed Islamist group.The following July, one sunny summer’s morning in London’s city centre, he blewhimself to pieces as the deadly cargo of explosives he’d concealed inside hisrucksack blitzed a gaping, crimson hole in one of the major eastern arteries ofthe Underground.One sees a similar pattern of transition in the lives of his three associates.Ordinary, regular guys who gradually, through the circles they started to movein, began to see things ‘differently’.Who began to see the lines not as they really were. But instead, as others sawthem.GREEN ROOMI am, in the interests of simplicity, cutting corners here, of course. Inaddition to weight of numbers, there’s a portfolio of factors that go withincreased conformity. 5 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn5]These,laboratory studies have shown, include: feelings of incompetence or insecurity;a group presence of at least three (additional members generate minimalincrements in conformity); unanimity (the effect of even a single dissidentopinion is catastrophic); admiration for the group; no prior commitments; andgroup surveillance of the individual: in Asch’s line study, for example, theincidence of conformity tailed off dramatically when participants, rather thanindicating their opinions publicly, responded in private instead.Add to these a charismatic leader like Jim Jones, segregation from those with adifferent worldview (for members of the People’s Temple dissenting opinion waspretty thin on the ground in the jungle of north-west Guyana – as it was forShehzad Tanweer in the madrasa he visited in Lahore), and an incrementalinduction procedure incorporating progressively larger gestures of groupcommitment (distributing leaflets, mentoring new members, getting involved inpolicy decisions: the foot-in-the-door technique, in other words) and youeventually end up with something very dangerous indeed. The basic, raw materialsof brainwashing. The psychological equivalent of a ‘dirty bomb’.Yet even so there seems to be something missing; a vital piece of the jigsawstill unaccounted for. Consider, for a moment, the impact – the sheerexistential enormity – of a major terrorist attack or mass suicide. Can theevents that unfolded in Jonestown, the atrocities of 7/7, the devastation of9/11, really be explained by something as simple as peer pressure? Or are otherforces at work? Something deeper, something stronger, something, perhaps, alittle more neurological? Are the symptoms of affiliation always as florid asthose demonstrated by Asch? Or do strains of the virus sometimes lie dormant –their effects sequestered below the threshold of consciousness?A clue may lie in the work of Robert Cialdini – fresh from the zoo and that datewith the young offenders. 6 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn6]In2007, he and his colleagues conducted a study which tilted at immortality. How,they wanted to know, might hoteliers achieve the impossible: persuade guests –at least once during their stay – to reuse their towels?Cialdini was interested in the kinds of messages most likely to inducecompliance. Would it be those advocating descriptive norms (i.e. thosedescribing how others reuse their towels)? Or the more conventional type ofmessage promoting environmental awareness?To find out, five cards, each bearing one of the following messages, wererandomly assigned to over 200 hotel rooms – and the number of towels counted upafterwards: * ‘Help the hotel save energy’; * ‘Help save the environment’; * ‘Partner with us to help save the environment’; * ‘Help save resources for future generations’; * ‘Join your fellow guests in helping to save the environment (in a study conducted in fall 2003, 75 per cent of guests participated in our resource savings program by using their towel more than once …)’Which of the messages do you think was the most effective? Which of them wouldyou be most likely to comply with?If you think it’s the last one – ‘Join your fellow guests in helping to save theenvironment’ – then you’re not alone. Of the guests who saw this card in theirroom, 44 per cent reused their towels. The least effective – surprise, surprise– was the one that emphasised the benefit to the hotel: less than 16 per cent ofguests reusing their towels in this case. And in a follow-up study in which thesuccessful message was nuanced even further to read like this, ‘Join your fellowguests in helping to save the environment (in a study conducted in fall 2003, 75per cent of the guests who stayed in this room participated in our new resourcesavings program by using their towels more than once …)’ compliance shot up evenhigher, to 49 per cent.‘If you’re in a situation and not sure how to act,’ comments Noah Goldstein, oneof the researchers involved in the study, ‘you are going to look to other peopleand the norms of that situation.’Which brings us – you got it – straight back to Asch.Or does it? Let’s, for a moment, take a closer look at Cialdini’s experiment andcompare it with the line study. Notice anything different? Well, to begin with,of course, in Cialdini’s experiment there’s no departure from verifiable fact.Sure, the majority of guests who stayed in Room 320 might well have recycledtheir towels. But, hey, it’s not like you can get out a ruler or anything andmeasure such behaviour – the rightness or wrongness of it – like you can measurethe lines in Asch’s study.But that’s not the only difference. There’s another, more revealing, disparity.In Asch’s study, the majority were actually present. They were there, and therewas no getting away from them. As a conduit of influence they were, bothphysically and psychologically, conspicuous. In Cialdini’s study, in contrast –well, there was no majority. Not one you could see, at any rate. And, moreimportantly, not one that could see you. On paper, sure – they were a force tobe reckoned with. But that’s in no way the same as being there in the flesh –emerging from behind the shower curtain with a bunch of reusable towels. Yetstill they succeeded in persuading the guests to recycle.The results of Cialdini’s study are compelling. There is, they suggest, more toconforming than literally meets the eye. It’s not just a case of being seen asthe odd one out. Not by a long way. It goes deeper than that. We really do, itwould seem, have an in-built aversion to upsetting the apple cart.But another body of research goes one step further – suggesting that certainkinds of influence go so deep they can actually affect our perception. Quitefundamentally, in fact. And, moreover, that this insidious, mind-bendinginfluence isn’t the preserve of the establishment – the great and the good, theguys at the top of the pile – but of another social stratum entirely.The minority. The underdogs. Those who ‘see things differently’.SHADES OF INFLUENCE7 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn7]In 1980, the French socialpsychologist Serge Moscovici conducted a study that to this day has researchersscratching their heads. The aim of the study was to test drive Moscovici’s‘genetic’ theory of social influence – that definitive, fundamental changefilters upwards rather than downwards in society. And boy, did it do the trick.8 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn8]Trouble is, no one has managed itsince.Key to Moscovici’s theory was a ‘dual process’ model of social influence – theidea that minority influence differs not just quantitatively from that of themajority, but also qualitatively. The minority, Moscovici proposed, works behindclosed doors – through belief restructuring and cognitive civil war – whereasthe majority, as Asch showed, has a different agenda entirely: its persuasivepretensions lying not in getting us to question the status quo, but rather tosimply accept it.To test the theory was no mean feat. But the paradigm Moscovici came up withsent shock waves through social psychology. And, for that matter, throughcertain echelons of cognitive psychology too – where experts speculated on theprecise neurological mechanism that might feasibly underpin his conclusions.At the heart of the experiment lay afterimages – those ghostly hues that floatbefore our eyes whenever we overdose on particular fixes of colour. Morespecifically, negative afterimages – those that comprise a different shade orlustre to that of the original stimulus.Were these images set in stone, as the laws of perception dictated? Or were they– in the right hands – susceptible to influence?9 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn9]The study may be split into twogeneral phases. In Phase 1, the baseline phase, participants were shown a seriesof blue slides and were asked, after viewing each one in turn, to write down itscolour. After visually ‘detoxing’ against a plain white screen, they were also,again after each trial, asked to indicate the colour of the afterimage. Thisthey did on a nine-point scale, ranging from yellow/orange at one end (theafterimage of blue) to pink/purple at the other (the afterimage of green).Once these preliminary measures had been recorded, Moscovici then dividedparticipants up into two groups. One group was told that a fixed proportion ofprevious volunteers (18.2 per cent) had in fact seen the slides as green whilethe remainder (81.8 per cent) had seen them as blue. The other group was toldthe opposite: that 81.8 per cent had perceived the slides as green while therest of them … you got it … saw them as blue. Utter nonsense, but hey – enoughto install in the minds of those involved a ‘minority’ and ‘majority’ position.The formalities over, the fun began in earnest. Both groups of participants werethen shown another series of slides - 15 of them this time, all of them the sameblue colour as those they had seen initially – and were asked, after each one,to specify the colour out loud. So began the ‘influence phase’ – Phase 2.But there was a catch.This time they were joined by an associate who called out, after every trial,GREEN. No nonsense. No two ways about it. GREEN.And there was more. This time, after calling out the colour of each of the 15slides, participants also had to indicate the colour of each of the afterimages– where they fell on the same nine-point scale as before. Did the minorityreally work in a different way from the majority? Instantiate deeper, lasting,more structural changes in belief: conversion as opposed to compliance? Theafterimages held the key.If Moscovici’s theory were to hold water, then the ‘baseline’ afterimages fromPhase 1 should, following exposure to minority influence in Phase 22, shifttowards the pink/purple end of the spectrum (the afterimage of green).Consistent, consensual minority dissent, argued Moscovici, made people think.Especially – and this is important – if there were no vested interests. Itraised profound questions. Why the disagreement? Why the departure from thenorm? If there’s nothing in it for them – and there doesn’t appear to beanything – well, there has to be some reason for their actions, hasn’t there?Somewhere along the line there must be something. Maybe they’re right. Maybeit’s me. Maybe the slide is actually green …For those exposed to majority influence, however (in this case, thoseparticipants who had been told that 81.8 per cent of previous volunteers hadseen the slides as green as opposed to 18.2 per cent) no such shift inafterimage was predicted. The majority, remember, unlike the minority, just‘skimmed the surface’. Participants, Moscovici reasoned, might well go alongwith the majority associate on a superficial level. Declare, in public, that –yes – the slides were green. But privately, behind the veil of socialself-preservation, it was a different story entirely. In their heart of hearts,or mind of minds, they wouldn’t really believe what they were saying. Of coursethey wouldn’t. Nothing would really change. The slides would still be blue –just like they were the first time – with the same, corresponding afterimage. Itwould simply be a case of them publicly stating otherwise.The results of the study, when eventually they came, were incredible. To some,quite literally so. Could there really be a strain of persuasion so virulent asto unweave the fabric of low-level visual perception? Evidently, it seemed thatthere could.Just look at the graph.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_033_r1.jpg]Figure 5.2 – Mean afterimage scores. Higher scores show a shift towards theGREEN afterimage. (photo credit 5.2)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c05-fig2a]Exactly as Moscovici had predicted, when the associate representing the minorityposition called out green3, the colour of the afterimages began creeping towardsthe purple end of the spectrum, indicative of a real shift in perception. Ofhard, subterranean, cognitive rewiring. And this was despite the fact that theminority, again as predicted, had little impact on the public responses of theparticipants.In contrast however, observe what happened in the majority group (those who’dbeen told that 81.8 per cent of previous volunteers had seen the slides asgreen). Sure, the associate representing the majority position certainly had thebeating of their minority counterpart in public, when the participants had tostate the colour of the slides out loud. But in private, it couldn’t have beenmore different. Here, after-image perception actually shifted in the oppositedirection to purple. Towards yellow/orange.Minority ‘withinfluence’? It certainly seemed that way.TROUBLE ON THE CARDSMoscovici’s findings have proved fiendishly difficult to replicate. But notimpossible. Nowadays, in fact, the ‘dual process’ model of group influence is onpretty solid ground – and it’s generally accepted that, in contrast to the wayconformity works, the minority’s job is to ‘get under the brain’s skin’. There,provided it remains consistent and is perceived as genuine, it can chisel awayat old, established certainties – the things we take for granted – and force usto question the true nature of reality.At present, we may only speculate. But this – or something very much like it –might well have been what happened to Shehzad Tanweer and his associates in thelead up to the London bombings. And the followers of the Reverend Jim Jones. Or,upon reflection, something a little more concerted: a dual combination of bothminority and majority group process.On one level, it’s entirely possible that the effects of minority radicalisationreally did change the way Tanweer and his accomplices saw the world. Not justmetaphorically but neurologically, deep within their brains. On another, it’sequally plausible that the pressures of peer group allegiance – of inclusivenessand identity – worked on them in a completely different way: holding them fast,strapping them in, to a trajectory of death they simply couldn’t escape.Here, it wouldn’t only have been group forces acting on them either. Once theeffects of radicalisation had begun to take hold they would have laid themselvesopen to a number of persuasion viruses – confirmation bias, for instance: thetendency that we all have, not just those of us at the outermost reaches ofthought reform, to seek out evidence that confirms, rather than disproves, oursuppositions.10 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn10]Below, in Figure 5.3, you havefour cards. Each of these cards bears a number on one side and a colour patch onthe other. As you can see, the sequence at present reads: 3, 8, RED, and BROWN.These are the visible card faces. But imagine, for a moment, that you’re able topick the cards up – as many of them as you wish – and turn them over.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_034_r1.jpg]Figure 5.3 – The Wason four-card selection task.Question: Which card(s) would you turn over in order to test the truth of theproposition that if a card shows an even number on one side, then its oppositeface shows red?This classic puzzle – the Wason four-card selection task – was devised in 1966by the psychologist, and expert on human reasoning, Peter Cathcart Wason. It is,in actual fact, deceptively simple. Yet this still doesn’t prevent nearlyeveryone who has a go at it from getting it wrong. Yes, I’m afraid it’s one ofthose.Instinctively, most people opt for the 3 and the RED cards. Is that, by anychance, what you went for? If it is, let’s just stop and think for a momentabout what you were hoping to find.Let’s say, for instance, that you turn over the 3 card to reveal on the back ofit RED. Aha, you think, we’re in business. But are we? Let’s bring in ourproposition again and refresh our memories as to its exact wording. Theproposition states, ‘… if a card shows an even number on one side, then itsopposite face shows red.’ Hmmh. Does a 3 and a RED really invalidate this rule?Actually, the answer is no. Just because RED happens to be on the back of the 3card in no way precludes it from also hiding behind a 2.Likewise, if we flip over the RED card and discover … on the back of it … 5 –well, this doesn’t invalidate the rule either. In fact, we’re pretty much in thesame boat as before. Just because RED happens to be on the front of a 5 doesn’tautomatically disqualify it from fronting up a 4 …On the other hand, if we turn over the BROWN card and discover a 4 on the otherside of that, then we really are in business. This does disprove the rule. Asdoes an 8 card with black on the flipside.So the correct answer, it turns out, is actually 8 and BROWN. It’s only byturning over these two cards and attempting to falsify the statement – byactively seeking instances that do not conform to it – that we can challenge itsveracity.But what do most of us do? Most of us – completely unconsciously – seek outinstances that do conform. We try, most of the time without even realising it,to confirm what we already know.SKIN DEEPThis little test provides a concrete demonstration, as well as a gentlereminder, of the power of belief. Of how the stuff we carry around with usinside our heads often forms the selection committee for all further admissions.And it’s not as if the test is contentious in any way. No one, after all, has avested interest in how the cards are going to turn out (if you do, seek help).It’s a puzzle, pure and simple.11 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn11]Back in 1979, psychologistsMark Snyder and Nancy Cantor conducted a now classic experiment thatdemonstrated the power of confirmation bias not just inside the lab, butoutside: when it comes to the kinds of decisions we make on a daily basis.Snyder and Cantor handed participants a description of a person called Jane,which depicted her as being both introverted and extraverted in equal measure. Acouple of days later, they got one half to assess her for an extraverted job(estate agent), and the other half to assess her for an introverted job(librarian). What happened? You got it. Each group were better at rememberingthe attributes best suited to the job they were assessing.Exactly the same principle lies behind the placebo effect. 12[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn12]In an amusing, ingenious (thoughsadly, unpublished) study which supposedly looked at the influence of subliminalmessages on social interaction, a bunch of students had the word SEX daubed ontheir faces in sunscreen before going out and catching some rays. They were outjust long enough for the effect of the sunscreen to become noticeable (to theresearcher, that is, not the participants: volunteers were completely unaware ofthe content of the message) – in other words, for the word SEX to become verylightly emblazoned upon their skin. Then, over the course of the next week, theykept a diary of their social encounters.Would the subliminal ‘communication’ have any impact on the students’interactions with others?It sure did. Almost three-quarters of them reported at least one experience thatwas novel – and which they attributed to the messages on their faces. Suchexperiences included getting more attention from members of the opposite sex,and better treatment from sales clerks and fellow students.But here’s the deal. In actual fact, only one-third of the volunteers had theword SEX etched on their faces. For the rest, it was either a nonsense wordwritten in sunscreen, or a nonsense word written in water.But did that make any difference? Did it heck. The fact that volunteers believedthere was something written there got them looking for things to confirm it.Which, it turned out, were surprisingly easy to find.BELIEVING IS SEEINGUnfortunately, Jonestown and London 7/7 were not one-offs. On 26 March 1997, 39members of the Heaven’s Gate cult – at the behest of their leader MarshallApplewhite – drank a deadly cocktail of vodka and phenobarbital (and, for goodmeasure, pulled plastic bags over their heads to finish the job) in order toboard the mother ship they believed was descending to Earth. They were foundlying neatly in their bunks, all dressed identically in black shirts and sweatpants, brand new black-and-white Nike athletic shoes, and armbands bearing theslogan ‘Heaven’s Gate Away Team’. Sadly, they never made the game.It would be easy to laugh – if the consequences hadn’t been so tragic. And ifthe bizarre belief systems didn’t have such a terrifying, internal logic behindthe warped psychological razor-wire of the group. (This, as we saw earlier, iswhy cult leaders often set up their communities in remote locations – so as toisolate members from ideological challenge, and cultivate the conditions forwhat psychologists refer to as groupthink.)4But then none of us are immune to confirmation bias. We all do it. Show twoopposing football fans an identical tackle and to one it’s a foul and the othera fair challenge – depending on the outcome. In fact, given our tribal ancestry,our close-knit ties in the parched primaeval badlands of ancient East Africa,it’s especially resurgent in those situations in which group affiliation issalient.Take, for example, the high-profile arrest of Harvard professor Henry LouisGates at his home in Boston in the summer of 2009 on his return from a trip toChina.What do we know?Well, Gates, who is black, said that when he got home he found the door jammed –and that he and his driver attempted to force it open. He then said that hegained entry to the house through the back door, and was on the phone to theproperty’s management company when the police arrived.The police said that Gates became irate after Sergeant James Crowley, who iswhite, asked him for identification. They say that Gates accused Crowley ofbeing a racist, refused to calm down, and was arrested.Gates maintains he complied with Crowley’s request and turned overidentification. He says Crowley arrested him after he’d followed the policemanto the porch, repeatedly demanding the sergeant’s name and badge number becausehe was unhappy with the way he’d been treated.Crowley has since refused to apologise, saying he followed the acceptedprotocol.As should be clear from the discrepancy between these two accounts, one of theparties is being a tad economical with the truth. But which one? Chances arethat the side you come down on will have less to do with a detailed examinationof the evidence and a hell of a lot more to do with … well, what side you’re on.If, for example, you buy into institutional racism, or have had your rights as ahomeowner infringed in the past, or have been mistreated by the police, thenyou’re likely to see them as the culprits. If, on the other hand, you’re ahard-line Republican and think that Obama is a Muslim fanatic who’s biasedtowards the terrorists and – Whoa, look, here’s the proof – he’s wading in onbehalf of his friend who’s black … then the most likely scenario is that Gateshad ‘a chip on his shoulder’ and provoked the arresting officer.5The confirmation bias lies dormant in all of us. Most of us will never join acult, but all of us are subject to the latent gravitation of our own cherishedbeliefs. Inside Jonestown, the Reverend Jim Jones’ daily salvos confirmed to hisfollowers that their cause was right and that ultimately death would bring aboutpeace and justice. Sound familiar? It should do. Switch on your television andlisten to what comes out of Afghanistan.13 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn13]In fact a recent study byStanford University psychologists Scott Wiltermuth and Chip Heath suggests thatcults and the military have more in common than you may think. Armies train bymarching in step. Religions incorporate ritualised singing and chanting intotheir services.But why?Wiltermuth and Heath have discovered that groups whose members engage insynchronous activity together tend to be more cohesive – tend to co-operate witheach other more – than groups that don’t. Even when there are sound financialreasons to co-operate – like the experimenter giving out money. Might synchronyand ritual therefore have evolved – causing some groups to thrive and others toperish? It’s certainly not impossible.14 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn14]Social psychologist MilesHewstone asked students of two different faith traditions, Muslim and Hindu, toimagine that a member of their own faith had either helped them or ignored themin a time of need. He then got them to do exactly the same for a member of theopposing faith. Subsequently, the students were asked to guess what might haveinstigated the behaviour of either their Muslim or Hindu counterparts.Would they, when the opportunity presented itself, come down heavily on the sideof their own faith tradition and denigrate the other? Or would they remaineven-handed?Would they hell. Both Muslims and Hindus cited internal, personal factors as thereasons for in-group altruism; and external, situational factors for out-groupaltruism. In other words, in-group members acted of their own volition and oftheir own good natures – and, what’s more, would act in precisely the same wayif the same thing happened again – whereas out-group members were perceived ashaving little choice in the matter. And as being unlikely, in the event of anaction replay, to repeat such behaviour.In contrast, however, when it came to the question of members of the in-groupnot helping, there ensued, on both sides, an uncomfortable period ofthroat-clearing. Just as had been the case in the ‘surprising’ event of theout-group helping, indifference was chalked up to the situation. Hands weretied. It was an unfortunate one-off. And as for the out-group not helping? Wellthat was easy, wasn’t it? It was them all over. Inconsiderate. Unprincipled. Andaddled with self-interest.And it’s not just what we believe about others that influences how we seethings. Equally important is how we perceive ourselves. In the 2006 soccer WorldCup in Germany, German police fêted English fans – not exactly noted for theirtemperance on such occasions – as being the ‘best fans in the world’. Thetournament passed off without incident.Not, of course, that the compliment was genuine. You must be joking. Rather, theGermans had done their homework. 15[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn15]Research has shown that providingindividuals with false feedback about themselves can actually induce them toconfirm it. To behave in a manner consistent with that feedback. They become theperson that they believe themselves to be. Or, more accurately, the person thatthey believe others believe them to be. Which in theory, of course, can beanything.ALLIANCE DENIn August 2006, an elderly resident of the Strasshof district of north-easternVienna picked up her telephone and dialled 911. A distressed and dishevelledyoung woman had hammered on her kitchen window begging her to call the police.Some minutes later a squad car pulled up outside. A row with her boyfriend, thefrayed ends of an all-night party – there could have been any number of routineexplanations for the call. But not in this case. The woman in question turnedout to be Natascha Kampusch. And her story, it emerged, was anything butroutine.Eight years previously, aged just ten, Natascha Kampusch had vanished into thinair on her way to school. Her disappearance, at the time, had been all over theAustrian media – front-page news for at least a couple of weeks – and anationwide search had ensued. There were divers and dogs, a dedicated policeunit and civilian volunteers. Even the Hungarians got involved. But all of ithad come to nothing. Until now.In fact, for the whole time she’d been missing, Natascha Kampusch had beenliterally right there under their noses. In a scene that could easily havesprung from the pages of a Stephen King novel, she’d spent the greater part ofthe intervening years imprisoned in a dungeon she’d believed to be rigged withexplosives.Alone.Throughout her ordeal, during the entire period of her extraordinarysubterranean imprisonment, her only means of human interaction had been with herabductor, 36-year-old communications technician Wolfgang Priklopil. It was hewho’d effectively brought her up, providing her with food, clothes – everythinga ten-year-old could wish for. Everything an 18-year-old could wish for. Exceptfreedom. That, unfortunately, was where Priklopil drew the line.‘He gave her books, even taught her how to read and how to write,’ reported oneof the investigators in the case. ‘And mathematics and all things like this,according to what she told us.’The dungeon measured just four metres by three metres, and had a door 50cm by50cm.Completely soundproofed, it was sealed in an underground garage.And, like Natascha Kampusch herself, would probably never have come to light hadshe not made a bid for freedom while hoovering her captor’s car.6Miles Hewstone’s study with the Muslim and Hindu students shows what can happenwhen group identity suddenly becomes salient. We deify those who are like us,and vilify those who aren’t. We believe what we want to believe. But not allinter-group dynamics work this way round. Under certain, exceptional,circumstances we find ourselves believing what we don’t want to believe. Andhelping, even liking, those who do us harm.16 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn16]Take a condition known as theStockholm Syndrome – a phenomenon well-documented in the literature on hostagenegotiation, and perhaps even better documented in the mind of NataschaKampusch.The Stockholm Syndrome refers to a psychological dynamic in which hostages comeround to liking, even supporting, their captors. Typically this followsconciliatory gestures on the part of the captors, which run counter to theexpectation of the hostages. Such gestures might begin with something as simpleas the making of a cup of tea or the sharing of a bar of chocolate – and extendright the way along to requests for medical assistance or help ‘on the outside’.Even, in some instances, appeals for emotional support.And then there are the really extreme cases – like that of Natascha Kampusch.Here, the exploits of her captor Wolfgang Priklopil didn’t just stop at tea. Nordid they stop at chocolate. Instead, they ran the whole gamut of afather–daughter relationship, from the provision of food and clothing to that ofa full-time education. And, what’s more, not just for a period of a few days,but for eight years. Just think, for a moment, of the level of emotionaldissonance such intensity of commitment would foment; the dark forces of mindthat must have been pulsing backwards and forwards within the cramped and loadedcompass of that dungeon. 17 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn17]Are wereally surprised, even under such appalling confinement as this, that somedegree of captor–captive bonding might have surfaced?Precisely how the Stockholm Syndrome works is complex. It acts, for the mostpart, through a double hit of reciprocity and consistency – that lethal cocktailof influence we encountered in the previous chapter[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c04_r1.htm] courtesy of telesales employee PatReynolds. The fulcrum of the dynamic is the power differential between captorand captive. Conciliatory behaviour by the captor sets up an imbalance in themind of the captive between their feelings towards the captor (negative) and theactions of the captor (positive). Powerless to change the actions of the captor,the captive has only one means available to them – noxious though it may be – bywhich to restore cognitive consistency: change their attitude towards suchactions. Add to this our old friend the reciprocity principle – altruisticgestures should be paid back in kind – and the results, as we have seen, can bedevastating.But reciprocity and consistency aren’t the only culprits here. As MarshallApplewhite, Jim Jones (and others like them) know only too well, one of thebiggest secrets of mind control is control over everything else.RUFF WITH THE SMOOTH18 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn18]In the mid-1960s, cognitivepsychologist Martin Seligman stumbled, partially by accident, on a rathercurious phenomenon. It began with a routine conditioning experiment. Dogs, inline with the usual conditioning protocol, were exposed to a pair of stimuli inquick succession – a tone, followed by a harmless, though painful, electricshock – the aim being, through repeated association between the two, to elicitfear just of the tone itself.In order to ensure that the preliminary association between tone and shock wasproperly established, Seligman restrained the dogs in the initial conditioningphase of the study so that, following the onset of the tone, exposure to shockwas inevitable. They couldn’t, in other words, get away. But during the ‘testphase’ – in which the tone appeared on its own – things were different. The dogshad the chance to escape – evidence, were they to take it, that the conditioninghad proved successful.The experiment went badly wrong. And wrong in a way that no one could havepredicted. To Seligman’s amazement … nothing happened. Nothing whatsoever. Eventhough, in the test phase, the dogs had a clear escape route whenever the tonesounded, they simply stayed put. Incredibly, they made no attempt whatsoever toevade the ‘impending’ shock.Even more incredible was what happened next – when Seligman dispensed with thetones altogether and just administered shocks. Real ones. The dogs still didn’tmove. Feelings of learned helplessness – the term coined by Seligman to describesuch behaviour – had hijacked the animals’ brains and taken their ‘reasoning’hostage. So much so that they simply no longer cared.Today, Martin Seligman is still making waves. In 2002, in San Diego, he poppedup at a forum organised by the CIA as part of the US military’s SERE (survival,evasion, resistance, escape) program – a course specifically designed toinoculate pilots, Special Forces personnel, and other high-value captivesagainst torture. Or, if you prefer your definitions unabridged, techniques ofinterrogation explicitly outlawed by the Geneva Convention. There, to anaudience of psychologists and other US government officials, Seligman expatiatedfor three hours on – yes, you’ve guessed it – the dynamics of learnedhelplessness. 19 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn19]Though he hassince repudiated – and repudiated quite robustly – even the merest hint of asuggestion that he might wilfully have been associated with the formulation ofso-called ‘torture programs’, those present at the forum included a number ofkey US military personnel who later proved instrumental in developing techniquesof ‘enhanced interrogation’.Of course, some people are more prone to feelings of learned helplessness thanothers. 20 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn20]It depends on yourattributional style – or, to put it another way, the way you think about thethings that happen to you in life. Both positive and negative outcomes may beperceived as a function of two psychological dimensions:1. locus of control – whether you infer an internal cause for the outcome andtake personal responsibility for it vs whether you infer an external cause andput it down to the situation (examples of both of which we saw in MilesHewstone’s Muslim/Hindu study);2. generality – whether you see the outcome as a specific one-off or assomething longer-term.Imagine, for example, that you’ve just failed an exam. On the basis of these twodimensions, there are four different ways you can rationalise your performance:[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_036_r1.jpg]If you’re a pessimist, or prone to depression, then for negative outcomes likethis you’re more likely to have a general/internal attributional style (bottomleft box) – and be at greater risk of learned helplessness than someone who seesthings more specifically.In contrast, however, now imagine the following. You’ve just been handed yourquarterly report by your broker and discovered that shares in a new stock youbought have gone through the roof. Again, according to the two dimensions, thereare four different ways you can look at the situation:[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_037_r1.jpg]Here, when the outcome is positive, attributional styles reverse. It’s theoptimist who displays a general/internal profile (bottom left) – while thepessimist is more specific.In short, optimists take the credit for good outcomes and contextualise badones, while pessimists do the opposite: externalise the good times and blame thebad things on themselves.7But here’s the deal. Manipulate someone’s environment for long enough – floodthem with stimuli they continually have no control over – and sooner or laterattributions will start to change. Just like the dogs in Seligman’s experiment,external metastasises into internal – and cancer of the will develops. 21[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn21]A study in the seventies playedtape recordings of office machinery as volunteers solved puzzles. Guess what?They performed better when they believed the noise to be controllable than whenthey believed it to be uncontrollable: even though it was exactly the same noiseplayed at exactly the same volume.Even in routine police work, in interview rooms and custody suites a millionmiles away from the austerity of military detention centres, the dynamics ofcontrol play a crucial role in obtaining information. Especially, it would seem,when it’s in otherwise short supply.One senior British detective told me:Think about it. Some of the people we get in here are used to being top dog. Togetting their own way. We have gang leaders, wife beaters, you name it. But assoon as you come through those doors, the roles are reversed. We controleverything that happens to you in here. Every move you make. Anything you want –it’s entirely up to us. It’s up to us when you can have a cup of tea. It’s up tous when you can take a piss. It’s up to us whether the lights are turned on oroff in your cell. All those little things you tend to take for granted whenyou’re at home – forget it. Soon as you get in here, we’re in charge. We canlook in on you anytime we feel like it through an observation flap in the door.And if we don’t want to talk to you we can just snap it shut. See what I mean?When I say we control everything, I mean everything. And they’re just not usedto that, a lot of the people we get in here. They don’t like it one fucking bitwhen the boot’s on the other foot. But sooner or later most of them start to getit.’STICKING POINTOne sees exactly the same in cults. Alongside those factors we looked at earlier– those designed to increase the flow of conformity – cult leaders follow apattern: a curriculum of influence as devastating as it is predictable.Jonestown was situated in the wilds of north-western Guyana, where the travailof ‘getting out’ in many cases outweighed the benefits (links with externalfriends and family having gradually eroded over time). Jones’ voice droned 24hours a day from an intercom system – not so much washing the brain aswaterlogging it – and the children of followers were encouraged to call himDaddy. Slowly, insidiously, systematically, Jones – through monotonous,consistent persistence – willed himself into God. First he was everywhere. Thenhe was everything.Victims of domestic violence face an almost identical scenario. Listen to Lisa,a 35-year-old mother of two:It started with my friends. He’d say, ‘You’re too good for her!’ and thengradually that would be that. Whoever it was I slowly lost contact with. Samething happened with my family. He said my mum was against him, my brother wasagainst him, so why did I have anything to do with them? Even meeting up for acup of tea was seen as taking sides. He’d drop me to work at 9 and pick me upagain at 5 so that I wouldn’t have time to socialise with anyone. And he’d ringme up at lunchtime to see if I was alone. As for money, I didn’t so much assniff my salary for nearly a year and a half – he’d arranged for it to be paidstraight into his account …The violence kicked off with my clothes. If we were going out anywhere and Idecided to dress up and wear make up, he’d hit me and call me a slut. And if Ididn’t dress up, he’d hit me for not making an effort. I couldn’t win. Towardsthe end, he was even examining my underwear to see if I’d had sex with anyone.That, really, was what did it for me. That was the final straw.Cases like Lisa’s seem unbelievable when you set them out cold on the printedpage like this. Yet ask the Domestic Abuse Team of any police force in thecountry whether the details stack up and they’ll tell you exactly the samething: they come across hundreds of such incidences a year.Police Constable Andy Green of the Cambridgeshire Constabulary talks me throughthe profiles of the different types of offender. As he does so, I’m suddenlystruck by the ubiquity of the list: these descriptions, as well as relating todomestic abuse, could be applied just as easily to the workplace. There is, frommy own personal viewpoint, at least one former colleague I recognise in there!Green nods in agreement.‘Absolutely,’ he says. ‘These, basically, are just styles of persuasion that maybe put into practice anywhere. Just because they’ve been identified as beingpresent inside the home doesn’t mean to say that they can’t be found anywhereelse in life. In other contexts. They’re just different means to the sameunfortunate end.’22 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c05-ftn22]The taxonomy that Andy Greenruns by me might best be described as ‘semi-official’. It hasn’t been ratifiedas such, but is based on years of operational experience and has made it into abooklet. The inventory ranges from the Bully who shouts and sulks, to theHeadworker who puts you down – telling you you’re ugly, or stupid, or useless.Or all three combined. Others include the King of the Castle who treats you as aservant, the Liar – ‘Loosen up, it’s only a bit of fun’ – and the Persuader –who threatens, praises and flatters in equal measure.‘Often,’ Green adds, ‘the effects of the manipulation are so strong that evenwhen you open the door for [the victim] and say, “Here, you can leave … there’sa place you can go … don’t let him do this to you any more …” they look at youas if you’re crazy. “It’ll just make him angry,” they say. Or, “He doesn’treally mean it.” It’s like their brains have been immobilised by month uponmonth, year upon year, of being told the same thing over and over. Like they’vebeen infected by some kind of virus.’When I tell him about Martin Seligman, Green shakes his head.‘I wish I could say that was news,’ he says. ‘But I can’t.’Once, several years ago now, at a workshop on auto-suggestion, I myself wasinfected by the immobilisation virus at the hands of an ex-Special Forcesmartial arts instructor. I forget his name now, but let’s call him Curt. Curtbegan the workshop by lining ten of us up against a wall and telling us to claspour hands together as tightly as possible. He then told us that over the spaceof the next couple of minutes or so he was going to hack into our brains andhijack our free will. Quietly. Covertly. But mercilessly. Meanwhile, he said, wewere to continue clasping our hands.Curt’s assertion was greeted with suspicion. Though not, I must confess, (andI’m sure I wasn’t the only one), without some degree of foreboding. I alreadyknew a little bit about Special Forces – the kinds of things they were capableof. Could this be some kind of trick? Had Curt somehow managed to dab glue onour hands without us noticing? To be honest, I wasn’t certain.Sure enough, over the next couple of minutes, Curt got to work. ‘You’ll start tofeel your hands slowly getting stuck together,’ he intoned, ‘as if they’re beingheld in place by a very powerful adhesive. As you feel this,’ he added, ‘you areto press them together even tighter, to facilitate the bonding process and tomake it as strong as possible. Finger by finger,’ he continued – in a relaxed,deliberative, but completely authoritative voice – ‘you are to cement your handsinto position so that, even if you wanted to, you wouldn’t be able to movethem.’He went along each one of us in turn.‘Make the bond absolutely rock solid,’ he said, cupping his hands around oursand increasing the pressure even more. ‘In fact,’ he said, ‘make it so solidthat nothing, absolutely nothing, will be able to prise it apart …’Curt went on like this for another minute or so – confidently, methodically, andmatter-of-factly encouraging us to cement our hands together. This is insane, Ithought to myself, as I clenched my fingers as hard as I possibly could.Then suddenly I started to panic.What if the joke was on us? I thought. And our hands really were stuck together?What then? Was he going to mug us? Maybe the whole autosuggestion gig was someelaborate low-level scam specifically designed to get a load of suggestibleschmucks like us together in a room forking out a hefty enrolment fee. And look– everything was working like clockwork! Maybe, once we’d written out ourcheques, Curt was going to skim off what was left. From our credit cards. Whilewe were all stuck together with Superglue.The conniving bastard, I thought.That was it, wasn’t it? Of course it was. How could I have been so stupid? Itwas us who were crazy, not him.Calmly, frantically, I started ruminating. My wallet … how much was init … hmmh, don’t know … Cancelling the cards would be a pain in the arse … buthey … better than getting SHOT … What about photo IDs … well, for a start therewas my driving licence …Meanwhile, I kept clasping my fingers.Until, suddenly, Curt just stopped.‘Right,’ he said. ‘What I want you to do now is stop pressing your handstogether and slowly release your fingers. Do this on the count of three. Are youready? One … two … three …’We all eyed each other uneasily. I glanced at the guy standing next to me, andhe glanced back. ‘I’m not sure about this,’ he mouthed. ‘Me neither,’ I mouthedback. I realised I was sweating. Then we started unclasping. Some people managedit instantly. And immediately reached for their back pockets. Others, likemyself, found it more difficult. But one or two simply found it impossible.Their hands really were stuck fast! Just as Curt had predicted, try as theymight, they just couldn’t prise them apart.Eventually, of course, when the dust had settled and things had died down a bit,they did succeed in extricating themselves. Then we all shook our heads andlaughed. Ho-ho.But the lesson, as any good stage magician knows, was clear as day. Tell someonesomething often enough – and some of them, at some point, will come round tobelieving you.Believing you, no matter what.SUMMARYIn this chapter, we’ve seen how an ancient ancestral force field buried deepwithin the brain – the need to conform – can wield just as much influence overour attitudes and behaviour as any of the persuasion strategies employed bymodern-day advertisers and opinion formers. Old habits die hard, and the actionsof those around us – especially those similar to ourselves – place powerfulevolutionary magnets by the side of our brains’ belief compasses. Conformity,indelibly, is written into our genes. During the time of our forebears, when‘survival’ and ‘group’ were more or less synonymous, the market forindividuality was somewhat less buoyant than it is today – and the ability to‘keep one’s head down’ would almost certainly have conferred an advantage. It’sa lesson we’ve never forgotten.In a world fuelled by competing ideologies, our tribal origins can sometimesgive cause for concern. Group dynamics conform to certain laws, and those with aknowledge of such laws can, if so inclined, ‘genetically modify’ a group tocreate, within society, mutant strains of extremism far removed from the norm.But not all groups follow the same laws. And while the power of greater numbersreforms us from ‘on high’, the minority works ‘from within’: nudging the braininto questioning reality – into unpicking, then restoring, the transformativefabric of truth.In the following chapter, we turn the spotlight fully on split-second persuasion– placing it under the microscope and mapping its DNA.Is there, we ask, concealed within the melody of mind, a golden chord ofinfluence that all of us can play? Not just the persuasion virtuosi, but thestreet performers, too?The answer, it turns out, is yes. Our analysis uncovers the double helix ofinfluence, enshrined within which lies persuasion’s secret code.Attributional Style TestThe following ten statements refer to different ways of looking at life events.Indicate on the scale provided the extent to which you either agree or disagreewith each one.For example, if you strongly agree with the statement, circle 4.

The complete inventory of groupthink symptomsruns as follows: feelings of invulnerability creating excessive optimism andencouraging risk taking; discounting of warnings that might challengeassumptions; unquestioned belief in the group’s morality, causing members toignore the consequences of their actions; stereotyped views of enemy leaders;pressure to conform applied to dissenting, ‘disloyal’ group members; shuttingdown of ideas that deviate from the apparent group consensus; illusion ofunanimity; and ‘mindguards’ – self-appointed members who shield the group fromdissenting opinions (Janis, Irving L. and Mann, Leon, Decision Making: APsychological Analysis of Conflict, Choice and Commitment, New York, NY: FreePress (1977)).5 After the incident went national, Obama ended up inviting both of theprotagonists – Gates and Crowley – to join him for a beer at the Whitehouse, atwhat quickly became known as the ‘beer summit’. Though neither party apologisedfor their roles in the affair, they agreed to disagree and promised to talkagain.6 Kampusch was allowed out of the dungeon (located beneath Priklopil’s house)for limited periods to assist her captor with chores.

Word that some of the passengers are extremely nervous reachesthe cockpit. A few moments later, the pilot’s voice is heard.‘Jesus, we’re all going to die! We’re all going to die!’ he screams. ‘Oh, shit!That was the intercom light not the engine light …’The plane erupts with laughter and calm is restored.1‘Graham Chapman, co-author of the parrot sketch, is no more. He has ceased tobe. Bereft of life, he rests in peace. He’s kicked the bucket, hopped the twig,bit the dust, snuffed it, breathed his last and gone to meet the great Head ofLight Entertainment in the sky. And I guess that we’re all thinking how sad itis that a man of such talent, of such capability for kindness, of such unusualintelligence, should now so suddenly be spirited away at the age of onlyforty-eight before he’d achieved many of the things of which he was capable andbefore he’d had enough fun.‘Well, I feel that I should say, “Nonsense. Good riddance to him, thefreeloading bastard, I hope he fries!” And the reason I feel I should say this,is he would never forgive me if I didn’t. If I threw away this gloriousopportunity to shock you all on his behalf. Anything for him but mindless goodtaste.‘I can hear him whispering in my ear last night, as I was writing this. “Allright, Cleese,” he was saying, “you’re very proud of being the very first personever to say shit on British television. If this service is really for me, justfor starters I want you to become the first person ever at a British memorialservice to say fuck” ‘ – John Cleese, oration at Graham Chapman’s funeral, 1989.PERSUASION GENIUS1 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn1]One afternoon, in a classroom inrural Germany, a teacher sets his students the following problem. Add up, hesays, all the numbers between one and a hundred. He goes to the blackboard andsketches out the sum:1 + 2 + 3 … 98 + 99 + 100.And then he sits down and takes out a pile of paperwork.The kids in his class are only seven years old. So the teacher presumes it’lltake them the rest of the day. Just what he needs to finish off his chores. Butthen, after 20 seconds or so, one of them puts up his hand.‘Sir,’ says the boy, ‘I think I’ve got the answer.’‘Nonsense!’ says the teacher.‘It’s five thousand and fifty,’ says the boy.The teacher is dumbstruck. He approaches the boy and asks him to explainhimself. How did he manage to find the solution so quickly?‘It’s simple,’ says the boy.He goes to the blackboard and starts writing:100 + 1 = 10199 + 2 = 10198 + 3 = 101.Then, suddenly, he stops.‘See,’ he says. ‘There’s a pattern. Between one and a hundred there are fiftypairs of numbers that add up to one hundred and one. So the answer must be fiftymultiplied by one hundred and one. Which is five thousand and fifty.’Some years later, among a host of other discoveries, Carl Friedrich Gaussdeveloped modular arithmetic – a major contribution to the field of numbertheory – and is recognised today as one of the greatest mathematicians inhistory.I love this story about Carl Friedrich Gauss. Whether it’s actually true or not,I have no idea. But that’s not really the point. What I like about it is themaths. Its algorithmic secrecy. I like the idea that embedded within the tedioussequence of numbers is a clean and simple pattern. A pattern that reveals, werewe only able to discern it, a neat and elegant solution.What’s true of math is also true of persuasion. Faced with a problem that needsworking out, most of us go the long way round and do what we’ve learned in theclassroom: add up the numbers. But then we have the geniuses. The people whodon’t just hit the nail on the head, they kick it in the nuts for good measure.Imagine you’ve been asked to give a eulogy at the funeral of one of your bestfriends. You take your place in front of the congregation and start to gothrough the motions. 1 + 2 + 3 …‘He was a great friend and will be sadly missed. Blah, blah, blah …’Which is fine. You get there in the end.But now let’s imagine you solve things slightly differently: ‘Graham Chapman,co-author of the parrot sketch, is no more …’25050.Alternatively, imagine that you’re the captain of a plane flying through severeturbulence and that your passengers are terrified. What do you do? Well, youcould explain to them that air travel is actually one of the safest forms oftransport. That turbulence isn’t dangerous. And that you’ll soon be through theworst of it … 1 + 2 + 3 … Or you could do what the pilot did on that London toCape Town flight. Settle the nerves with a single knockout sentence.Finally, put yourself in the position of career cop Ron Cooper: 23 years in thejob and you’re faced with a man 100 feet up. It’s up to you to talk him down.You pull out your calculator and start punching in the numbers.‘Why don’t you just take a couple of steps back for a moment, I’m sure we canwork this out …’Or do you?‘Mind if I take my jacket off?’ Cooper asks. ‘You get a bit hot running upfourteen flights of stairs.’‘Do what you want,’ says the guy. ‘I don’t give a fuck.’Slowly and painstakingly, in howling wind and pouring rain, Cooper startsundoing the buttons of his police overcoat. Twenty minutes – and 14 storeys –earlier, he’d been first on the scene when the call had come through. Young man.Aged around 25. On roof of multi-storey car park. Threatening to jump.‘The world’s a pile of shit!’ the guy had shouted to the gathering crowd ofonlookers down below. ‘No one gives a fuck any more. No one cares whether I liveor die. So why should it bother me?’Cooper takes off his coat. Then his tie. And then, with the guy on the ledgeeyeballing him all the time, starts to unbutton his shirt.‘Don’t try anything funny,’ the guy says, as Cooper is about to remove it. ‘OrI’m off!’’‘Course not,’ says Cooper as he folds it up neatly and puts it to one side.‘Just trying to get comfortable, that’s all.’He’s down to just a T-shirt as the wind continues to howl and the rain turns tosleet.PISS OFF – I’VE GOT ENOUGH FRIENDS! reads the slogan on the front.He manoeuvres himself on to the ledge and then turns to face the young man headon, so the slogan is fully visible. He looks him in the eye.‘Right then,’ he says. ‘You want to talk about it or what?’ANATOMY OF INFLUENCEThe solutions that Ron Cooper, John Cleese and the airline pilot came up with totheir very different predicaments worked brilliantly. (You’ll be pleased to knowthat the guy on the ledge saw the funny side of Cooper’s T-shirt.) But no twopeople think alike. Their solutions worked for them, at that particular moment.And lucky for them that they did.Such an observation has important implications for the way we’ve been looking atpersuasion up until now. The funeral speech. The talking down. The nervouspassengers. There could, in theory, be any number of solutions to such problems.Equally irreverent (or not, as the case may be). And equally ‘Gaussian’. Itdepends on who you are. And who, even more importantly perhaps, your audiencemay be.On the other hand, however, we’ve also been looking at a system. A formula. Apersuasion algorithm – that, if correct, would seem to factorise such variation,such diversity of style, into a triad of rhetorical constants: 1. the basic raw material of what you say – what your audience pays attention to; 2. the manner in which you deliver that raw material – a major predictor of how your audience will process or approach it; 3. psychosocial factors relating to how your audience evaluates you, or appraises what you say, in the context of their relationship with others: the parameters of affiliation.So how do we reconcile these two contrasting standpoints? Is all successfulpersuasion, in its many different guises, subsumed within the Three As? Or isthere something else: something Keith Barrett’s been missing down the years?To answer this question I became a persuasion collector. Over a period of 18months, from a wide variety of sources, I put together an ‘influence bank’: adefinitive anthology, of over 150 examples, of sudden, dramatic turnarounds.Like the one enacted by Ron Cooper. Or, if you remember back to theIntroduction, by the musician on the aeroplane. Examples such as these – ofsplit-second persuasion, as I called it – were integral, I figured, to mappingthe genome of influence. If the Three As really were endemic to persuasion, ifthey really did constitute the basic building blocks of mind control, then wherewould they most likely show up? In the game-changers, and cliffhangers, andmatters of life and death? Or over Michelin-starred profiteroles in first class(assuming, of course, there wasn’t a total dickhead in the cabin)?Once the database had started to gather momentum, I found some volunteers. Readover these scenarios, I told them. And then, for each one, write down thefactors that you think most contributed to the persuasive outcome. The resultswere astonishing. Analysis revealed there were five major axes of persuasion: 1. simplicity; 2. perceived self-interest; 3. incongruity; 4. confidence; 5. empathy.Or SPICE for short.Remarkably, these five factors fitted perfectly not just with Keith Barrett’sThree As (simplicity and incongruity mapping on to attention; confidence on toapproach; and perceived self-interest and empathy on to affiliation) but alsoincorporated those principles we saw earlier were so integral to influence inthe animal kingdom. As well, of course, as to neonatal persuasion.Here was an influence that united all influences. That had an incubation periodof seconds. A strain of persuasion so immediate, so dangerous, so ancient – itdidn’t just turn the tables, it kicked ‘em over. In the number of words (justask Ron Cooper) you could slap on the front of a t-shirt.SIMPLICITYCOLOUR BLINDA few years ago now, I remember a local London newspaper carrying the story ofan elderly Afro-Caribbean man travelling home from work on a bus. At one of thestops a drunk guy got on and couldn’t find a seat.‘Get up, you fat black nigger bastard!’ he shouted at the man.‘You calling me fat?’ said the man.The bus erupted with laughter, and the drunk guy got off.Disaster averted in just four amazing words.The golden rule of any kind of persuasion – from politics to advertising, fromnegotiating that contract to preventing a large-scale race riot – is that it’snot what you say that necessarily wins the day, but how you say it. Often, thesimpler the better.Research has indicated time and time again that our brains have a bias forsimplicity. 2 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn2]Consider, forexample, the addition problem below. Cover it up with a piece of paper then workyour way down to reveal each number in sequence as you add them up in your head:[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_038_r1.jpg]What answer did you get? If you came up with 5,000 try again. In fact thecorrect answer is 4,100. So what went wrong? Well, when the brain reaches thepenultimate subtotal of 4,090 it expects that the final total will be a nice andeasy round number. So it takes a gamble on the one that springs quickest tomind: 5,000.FIRST CLASS INFLUENCEThe sense of fluency that the brain gets when it processes information is a keypredictor of whether it’s going to ‘run with it’ or not. Simple is good.Complicated is bad. This is why split-second persuasion is so powerful. Itcomprises, in zoological terms, the modern-day human equivalent of a keystimulus of influence. Like the world’s top exponents of the martial arts – someof whom, as we shall see later, are well into their 80s – the flipnotist wasteslittle energy. In exactly the same way as the shadowy monks and ghostlygrandmasters zero in on physical pressure points, the flipnotist, in turn, goesstraight for the psychological jugular.In flpnsis, in othr wrds, only infrmtn essntl 2 d commnctn of d mssge is incldedin d mssge.3 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn3]Luke Conway, Professor ofPsychology at the University of Montana, studies the role of simplicity inpolitical oratory. What he’s turned up is intriguing. Conway has found that whenpoliticians are running for election … guess what? They go back to basics andtheir policies get less fancy.Conway analysed the four State of the Union addresses of 41 American presidentsin their first terms, and detected a pattern. He discovered that the longer apresident served in office, the greater the decline in ideological complexity.The correlation was linear. Inaugural State of the Union addresses were nuanced.They were inclusive in tone – typically more embracing of opposing points ofview. And, conceptually speaking, more fussy. The last address – the oneimmediately preceding potential re-election – was, for a politician, about asnailed down as you can get.‘Simplicity sells,’ concludes Conway. ‘No one marches to rallying cries thatsay, “I may be right, I may be wrong, let’s dialogue.’ ”Take, for instance, one of the greatest political clarion calls in history. WhenWinston Churchill delivered his immortal, ‘We shall fight them on the beaches …’speech on 4 June 1940, in the wake of the withdrawal of the BritishExpeditionary Force from Dunkirk, he could have put it differently. Instead ofgoing down as one of the greatest pieces of oratory ever spoken, Churchill’saddress to his people might have gone something like this: ‘Hostilities will beengaged with our adversary on the coastal perimeter …’Unfortunately, we shall never know why Churchill settled on the particularversion he did. People do funny things under pressure, don’t they? But, on aslightly less dramatic note, we do know why the marketing department of Marks &Spencer have recently put ‘Exclusively for Everyone’ on the sides of theirtransportation fleet.‘There’s not much room on the side of a truck,’ a spokesman told me when Icalled. ‘Even less on a van. And if you’re moving in traffic, not much time toread it. I suppose we could have put, “We have top-quality merchandise which isaffordable and widely available.” But somehow it doesn’t have the same ring toit, does it? In advertising, it’s best to keep things simple.’4 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn4]Matthew McGlone, at theUniversity of Texas in Austin, and co-worker Jessica Tofighbakhsh have conductedan experiment on poetry. Well, not poetry exactly. More rhyme. In an ingenioustake on the anatomy of wisdom, McGlone and Tofighbakhsh set out to investigatewhether statements that rhyme contain more truth – or rather, are perceived ascontaining more truth – than those that don’t.To get the ball rolling, McGlone and Tofighbakhsh assembled a portfolio ofpithy, but obscure, aphorisms. Next they added their own, somewhat discordant,modifications to the mix. ‘Caution and measure will win you treasure’ theyamended to ‘Caution and measure will win you riches’. And ‘What sobrietyconceals, alcohol reveals’ to ‘What sobriety conceals, alcohol unmasks’. Theythen got a group of volunteers to read over their stockpile of wisdom – both theoriginal and the modified offerings – and rate each one for accuracy. How well,McGlone and Tofighbakhsh asked them, did the proverbs stack up against reallife?Just as we might have predicted – and just as McGlone and Tofighbakhsh didpredict – they went for resonance. Participants perceived the originalstatements that rhymed as being less cutesy and more genuine than the modifiedones that didn’t. As providing a truer, more accurate reflection of the waythings really are.And why?Well such statements, the researchers suggest, our brains can swallow whole. Wedon’t have to worry about chopping things up into smaller, more manageablepieces. We process such language more quickly. Such insight and meaning morefluently. And fluency, as we’ve just seen in politics, breeds confidence.When I was a kid I remember the boxer Muhammad Ali prognosticating before afight about which round he would win in. Funny thing was, he often did it inrhyme:He hits like a flea so I’ll take him in three.He wants to go to heaven so I’ll drop him in seven.He thinks he’s great so I’ll get him in eight.Was Ali, unconsciously or otherwise, tapping into a secret law of persuasionhere? Did his ability to couple make the minds of his opponents more supple? Didhis penchant for rhyme make him better at judging time? Did putting it in verse,make his punches feel worse? It’s certainly possible. A lot of Ali’s predictionsactually came true.A few years ago now, when I first began work on split-second persuasion, I didthe rounds among airline check-in staff. Purely in the interests of research, ofcourse, I happened to ask them about first class. More specifically, how to getinto it.While boiling things down to a single ‘upgrade algorithm’ proved impossible(well, I’m hardly going to tell you, am I?) a number of the people I spoke tomentioned humour. In fact, one Aer Lingus employee I interviewed in Dublinrecalled an instance so extraordinary, an occasion when a line just so ‘worked’on him – ‘Do you have a window seat … in first class?’ – that he didn’t evenhave to think about it.‘It wasn’t just what he said,’ the Aer Lingus guy told me. ‘It was the way hesaid it. I’m telling you – this bloke could’ve dealt crack at a Jehovah’sWitness convention. It was the way he looked at me, even. It was, like, come on– I won’t tell if you won’t. He was confident, but not in a cocky way like youget with some of them. He was obviously chancing his arm, but it was so simple.I just wasn’t expecting it.’And that’s just it. The illusion that many of us have when it comes topersuasion is that it has to be complicated. It doesn’t. Like the catchiesttunes – the ones that go round and round inside our heads – the catchiestinfluence is simple. It’s cheeky. It’s fresh. And it’s right there in your face.Read back over what that Aer Lingus guy said. There’s a tell-tale signaturethere. Incongruity. Confidence. Empathy. And, if you count the sneaky insertionof reciprocity – ‘I won’t … if you won’t’ (more on that later) – perceivedself-interest.And all packed into nine simple words.PERCEIVED SELF-INTERESTPAIR OF BANKERSThe rock band Oasis were playing a gig in Manchester when technical problemsforced them to leave the stage. When they came back, lead singer Liam Gallagherannounced to the 70,000-strong crowd, ‘Really sorry about that. This is a freegig now. Everyone will get a refund.’ Next day, 20,000 fans took him up on theoffer – at a cost to the band of over £1 million. What to do?True to their word, Oasis coughed up. But there was a twist. Cheques were sentout personally signed by both Liam and Noel – and bearing a unique ‘Bank ofBurnage’ logo (Burnage being the area of Manchester where the band started out).A band spokeswoman said: ‘People can obviously cash them in. But they are quitedistinctive so a few people may decide to keep them.’A couple have shown up on eBay.If you want the secret of persuasion in just a few simple words, it’s easy.Appeal to the other party’s self-interest. Or, more specifically, to theirperceived self-interest – what they think is to their advantage. It’s also oneof the golden rules of management. Want to influence your boss? Then find outwhat their boss wants. Quick recap: What’s the best way of riding a horse?Right. In the direction in which it’s going. Hang around a schoolyard for anylength of time (or maybe, don’t) and you’ll soon see what I mean. Kids get whatthey want from each other by doing one of two things. They either trade (If youlet me have a go on your PlayStation, I’ll give you some of my chocolate bar),or they make threats (If you don’t let me have a go on your PlayStation, I’lltell Mrs. Jenkins that you stole my chocolate bar). It’s the law of the jungle.The smart ones even turn the tables on us grown-ups. I was at a New Year’s Eveparty once when my friend was about to put her nine-year-old to bed.‘But, Mum,’ he pleaded. ‘It’s only eight-thirty. Let me stay up.’Mum was adamant.‘You know what you’re like when you have a late night,’ she said. ‘You’re tiredfor days afterwards.’‘Well,’ replied her son, without missing a beat, ‘do you want me to be runningaround at seven in the morning when you’re having a lie-in?’Nice.Diplomacy, someone once said, is the art of letting other people have your way.5 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn5]And making sure they feel goodabout it.PRESSING ENGAGEMENTThe Gallagher brothers aren’t usually noted for their diplomatic skills. Butover the refund incident they surpassed themselves. Chances are those chequeswill become collectors’ items a few years down the line – and worth a heck of alot more than they are right now. Cashed or flogged on eBay. Yet at the sametime, no one can accuse the boys of not honouring their promise. Smart move.What Oasis did here isn’t rocket science. It’s biology. By issuing those cheques– the ultimate in ‘limited editions’ – they were in fact tapping into an ancientlaw of influence called scarcity. 6[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn6]Scarcity is one of six evolutionarypersuasion principles outlined by our old friend Bob Cialdini, Professor ofPsychology at Arizona State University – and refers to the observation that theless there is of something, the more we want it. The other principles, whichwe’ve already come across in various guises, include reciprocity (feelingobligated to return favours); commitment and consistency (like the Gallaghers,we aim to be true to our word); authority (we defer to those in power); liking(we say yes to those we like); and social proof (we check out what others aredoing if we’re not too sure ourselves).Because of their evolutionary underpinnings, and of their role in primaevalsurvival, each of these principles operates directly on the level ofself-interest. Take social proof, for instance. 7[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn7]A recent study from the Universityof Aberdeen reveals that if a man goes into a bar, his attractiveness levelrises 15 per cent if accompanied by a smiling female (take six and you can’tfail). And exactly the same copy-cat reflex is found in animals. Female grouseand guppies – everything else being equal – choose mates they’ve previously seencopulating with a dummy over those they haven’t (though I’m not suggestinganyone goes that far). Why? Because under conditions of uncertainty or limitedinformation, the principle of social proof acts as a powerful self-interestheuristic. If other females are attracted, then what’s not to like?The persuasive properties of self-interest are often difficult to convey onpaper. None of us really like to think of ourselves in purely selfish terms –it’s in our interests not to. But let’s have a go with this.Imagine that you, along with 29 others, volunteer for a handsomely, if ratherbizarrely paid psychology experiment I’m running. When you turn up for theexperiment, I show each of you into a separate cubicle which contains a buzzerconspicuously located on a central panel. I tell you, prior to your enteringyour cubicle, that you’ll remain inside for a period of ten minutes, but thatyou’re free to press the buzzer any time you want. The first person to press thebuzzer, however, will signify the end of the experiment. Oh, and one otherthing. You can’t communicate with anyone else in the cubicles.Now I said that the terms weren’t exactly straightforward – and here’s where itgets interesting. If, at the conclusion of the full ten minutes, it transpiresthat no one has pressed the buzzer, then everyone – that’s you, and your 29buddies – will each receive a free 21-day vacation anywhere in the world of yourchoosing. However if, on the other hand, at any point during that ten-minuteperiod someone does press the buzzer, then whoever it is will receive a freesix-day vacation, and you and everyone else will get nothing.The clock’s ticking.What do you do?On first encountering the Wolf’s Dilemma3 – which, in case you were wondering,is what this is – most people don’t need to be asked twice. It’s plain as daywhat you should do. Hold out for the full ten minutes. If everyone stickstogether, then everyone will be slapping on sunscreen for 21 days, right? Well,sort of. That’s the big question, isn’t it? Will everyone stick together? Maybe.Maybe not. What are the chances that there’ll be someone in the group who, outof pure self-interest or random stupidity, ‘accidentally’ presses the buzzer?Can you afford to take that risk?The more you think about it, the more it becomes apparent that the rationaloption is, in actual fact, to press the buzzer yourself. If the chances are thatat least one of the 29 others is going to blow it for the rest – and jet offinto the sunset for six days – then is there really any good reason why itshouldn’t, in fact, be you? In fact, the best move of all is not even to thinkabout pressing it. Just press it. As soon as you enter the cubicle. If, afterall, you’ve managed to figure out that it’s in your own best interests to hitthe button, what’s to say that one of the others won’t have too? And what’s tosay they’re not going to do it now?TEST OF TIMEIt was the seventeenth-century British philosopher Thomas Hobbes who coined thephrase ‘a war of all against all’ to describe what life would be like withoutgovernment. (Though with the credit crunch, Afghanistan and the MPs’ expensesscandal one wonders if it’s not worth a try.)But I prefer the words of former Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam: ‘Thepunters know that the horse named Morality rarely gets past the post, whereasthe nag named Self-interest always runs a good race.’Whitlam, in fact, might well have been speaking literally – if the results of astudy at Princeton back in the seventies are anything to go by. 8[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn8]Psychologists John Darley andDaniel Batson divided students at Princeton Theological Seminary into twogroups. The first group were told that they were to record a videotaped speechabout the kinds of jobs they thought seminary students might be best suited toafter graduation, while the second group were told to talk about the GoodSamaritan. Both groups were then given several minutes’ preparatory time inwhich to make some notes, after which the researcher informed them that thestudio in which the recordings were to take place was situated in an adjoiningbuilding accessed by an interconnecting alleyway.Now here comes the interesting bit. Before they set off, not all the studentswere given the same brief by the researcher. In fact, they were furthersub-divided into an additional three groups and told completely differentthings.The first group were told: ‘It’ll be a few minutes before they’re ready for you,but you may as well head on over. If you have to wait over there it shouldn’t befor long.’The second group were told: ‘The assistant is ready for you, so please go rightover.’And the third group were told: ‘Oh, you’re late. They were expecting you a fewminutes ago. We’d better get moving. The assistant should be waiting for you soyou’d better hurry.’And then off they went.The journey, however, had a surprise in store. Slumped in the doorway of theinterconnecting alleyway was an associate. His head was down. His eyes wereclosed. And he wasn’t moving. As the students passed by, he coughed – twice –and groaned.The big question was this: How much help would each of the students give him?To help them decide, the researchers agreed beforehand on a points system. Thestudents would be awarded nothing if they failed (or appeared to fail) to evennotice the ‘casualty’. They’d get one point if they recognised his need for helpbut didn’t stop. Two points if they didn’t stop, but reported the matter to thevideotape assistant who was waiting for them in the next building. And a maximumof five points if they stayed with the associate and accompanied him to a placewhere his condition could be assessed. The results of the study are shown below.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_039_r1.jpg]Figure 6.1 – Can’t stop – I’m late for my sermon. (photo credit 6.1)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c06-fig1a]Sure enough, even among students at an elite theological seminary such asPrinceton, and even among students at an elite theological seminary such asPrinceton who had just been making notes on the parable of the Good Samaritan,self-interest told. And told big time. As the graph shows only too clearly,those students who were running late barely even noticed the man slumped in thedoorway.They were too busy trying to be good.Early last year, the radio presenter Terry Wogan came under fire from varioussections of the media after news leaked out of an £800,000 salary. In spite ofthe fact that his weekday slot commanded the lion’s share of the figures, andhad, over the years, afforded him iconic (make that ironic) status, there wererumblings from various quarters that he was grossly overpaid. Add to that theprevailing financial climate, and an unsavoury scandal involving two of hisbroadcasting colleagues, and the mud might well have stuck. But Wogan saw itdifferently.‘That,’ he quipped, with trademark avuncular aplomb, ‘works out at two pence perlistener. I think I’m cheap at the price.’End of story. As soon as self-interest was deflected, and the numbers rejiggedto benefit his detractors, that pretty much was that.INCONGRUITYBRAIN SCAM9 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn9]You don’t find many conjuringtricks in science books. But here’s one for you. Below, in Figure 6.2a, are sixplaying cards. Select one of them by touching it, stare at it for five secondsto build up a mental picture, and then briefly turn the book over and visualiseit in your mind’s eye. Don’t tell me what it is, just keep it in your head.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_040_r1.jpg]Figure 6.2a – Pick a card.Done that? OK, good. What I’m going to do now is pick the cards up and shufflethem, and then lay them back on the page – only this time face down and removingone in the process. You won’t notice me doing this.Ready? Here goes …[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_041_r1.jpg]Figure 6.2b – Original display minus one …Excellent! So far so good.OK, what you should now have in front of you are five cards. Face down. Thesixth card I have with me here. Bear with me for a moment while I just check tosee which it is – I removed it without looking. OK, got it.Want me to show you? To find out which card I’m now holding in my hand, go tothis page at the end of this chapter to ‘turn the cards over’ for yourself. Doit now and come straight back.So, which card was it? Was it, by any chance, the one you selected?I guess that’s magic, folks.PICKPOCKETING THE BRAIN‘The secret of conversion,’ the Greek philosopher Plato once wrote, ‘lies not inimplanting eyes because the eyes exist already. Rather,’ he added, ‘it lies ingiving the eyes a right direction which they have not.’He’s spot on. 10 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn10]Magicians, ofcourse, have known this for centuries. As have pickpockets. ‘A big move covers asmall move’ is one of the most tried and tested maxims in the business – andrefers to the fact that if two movements occur simultaneously, observers willattend to the larger, or more salient, of the two.Take the ‘mind-reading’ trick above. You’ve probably gathered by now that it hadnothing to do with mind reading whatsoever – and everything to do with mindstealing. With what in magic theory is known as passive misdirection, and incognitive psychology as exogenous attentional capture. By getting you to focusexclusively on the one card – the card of your choice – chances are you hardlyeven noticed the other five. You were aware that they were there – you could seethem – but you simply didn’t attend to them.Big mistake.If you only have eyes for your own card, and have no idea about the identity ofany of the others, all I need do is remove one at random and change the otherfive and it will appear as if the only card missing is your own. That one card –the card you choose – acts as a visual target. As a kind of ‘neural bouncer’ –manhandling attention out through a side door of consciousness. And into a taxihome.When it comes to persuasion we could learn a thing or two from magicians andpickpockets. Take Ron Cooper, for example, in the howling wind and rain.Irrespective of how hot they may be, who in their right mind would start takingtheir clothes off in those conditions? Would you? Cooper, of course, has areason for what he’s doing. The T-shirt. But the guy on the ledge doesn’t knowthat. Instead, he must play along – as with each loosened button, the standoffgets more bizarre.Then comes the grand finale: PISS OFF – I’VE GOT ENOUGH FRIENDS!More incongruity. More psychological Semtex. Situations like this generally callfor tact. For the shoulder-to-cry-on approach. Everyone knows that. The guy onthe ledge knows that. And Cooper knows he knows it. But not this time. It’s arisky play, but humour, Cooper has calculated, is a strong hand. Stronger (or sohe hopes) than standing on the roof of a multi-storey car park in the rain.Incongruity works in persuasion for precisely the reason that it doesn’t work inmagic. Because it’s out of the ordinary. And yet, at the same time, forprecisely the same reason. Big covers small.STROOP TEASEThe power of incongruity to stop the brain in its tracks, to sneak up on it frombehind and ram the barrel of surprise into its back, is nothing new. It’s as oldas the hills, in fact. ‘Make a noise in the east and attack from the west,’ theancient Zen masters used to say – a doctrine still integral to many forms ofmartial arts today. In karate, for example, the concept of teishin, a ‘stoppingmind’, refers to a mind temporarily, and dangerously, dislocated from itsprimary focus. While in the courtroom – home, since the sophists of AncientGreece, to exponents of linguistic ju-jitsu – victory is also, in part,predicated on surprise.11 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn11]The mercurial British barristerFrederick Smith once defended a bus driver against claims that his negligencehad caused injury to a passenger’s arm. Rather than employ an aggressive line ofquestioning with the plaintiff, Smith, contrary to expectation, adopted a moreconciliatory tone.‘Will you please show the court,’ he asked the passenger, ‘how high you’re ableto lift your arm now – after the incident in question?’The respondent, doubled up with pain, raised his arm to shoulder level.‘Thank you,’ said Smith. ‘And now,’ he continued, ‘would you be so kind as toshow the court how high you could lift it before the accident?’The plaintiff’s arm shot clean above his head.The properties of distraction, that make incongruity such a force to be reckonedwith in persuasion, may be appreciated in greater detail from the followingexercise.Take a look at the series of squares in Figure 6.3a below. In each of thesesquares, a word appears in a different location. Proceeding from top left tobottom right and working methodically along each row, your task is to say outloud the position each word appears in (left; right; up; down). State theposition as quickly as you can. Don’t read the words – just state the positionin which they appear.With me? Let’s go …[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_042_r1.jpg]Figure 6.3a – Which position do the above words appear in: up, down, left, orright? (photo credit 6.3a) [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c06-fig3aa]How was it? Pretty easy? OK, that’s good.Now what I want you to do is to repeat the task for the list of words shownbelow in Figure 6.3b opposite. Again – just state the position that each wordappears in. DO NOT – I REPEAT, DO NOT – READ THEM!!OK?Off you go …[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_043_r1.jpg]Figure 6.3b – Repeat as for Figure 6.3a. Which position do the words appear in:up, down, left or right?How did you get on this time? Different story? Thought so. Most people, in fact,find this second list considerably harder. But why? Well, the reason is reallyquite simple. On the second list the conscious instruction to state the positionof the words crosses swords with the unconscious expectation of simply readingthem – a juddering of the gears rendered particularly bumpy by the hideousincongruity between the words and their positions. Suddenly, in other words,expectation and reality are no longer an item. And performance on the taskdeteriorates.12 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn12]This paradigm – a variant ofsomething called the Stroop Task – is an old favourite of cognitivepsychologists, especially those interested in the processes and mechanisms ofattention. And with good reason. The interference or disruption effect generatedby the two competing urges – one’s natural inclination to read the words versusthe diabolical directive to override what comes naturally and state theirposition – isn’t just confined to language. It happens, in fact, pretty much allthe time – whenever, for instance, we find ourselves in unfamiliar surroundingsor are surprised by the unexpected.13 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn13]Barbara Davis and Eric Knowlesof the University of Arkansas have demonstrated how this works in a pair ofstudies involving door-to-door salesmen and street-vendors. Davis and Knowlesuncovered something remarkable about the way we spend our money: a targetclientele were twice as likely to purchase Christmas cards from a door-to-doorsalesman if he unexpectedly quoted the price in cents rather than dollars – andpatrons of an outdoor market bought extra cupcakes from a stallholder if hereferred to them not by their standard appellation but instead, somewhatunusually, as ‘half-cakes’. But there was a catch. In both instances the stingonly worked if a tagline was inserted immediately after the anomaly. In the caseof the Christmas cards, ‘It’s a bargain!’ And in the case of the cupcakes,‘They’re delicious!’Of course, what’s going on here isn’t particularly sophisticated. It’s alow-level psychological con trick. The incongruous ‘first impression’ – set of36 Christmas cards for 2,844 cents – hustles the brain into skimping on thesmall print. Into ‘seeing cents’ – or not, as the case may be. Before it hastime to reconsider, confidence and empathy weigh in: ‘It’s a bargain!’ ICE(incongruity, confidence and empathy) functions, as a unit, much like a SWATteam. The role of incongruity - 2,844 cents – is that of first man in: thedeployment of explosive entry, and the creation of confusion. It induces in therecipient a momentary, split-second trance during which the confident, empathicnano-hypnotic suggestion – ‘They’re delicious!’ – may be introduced covertlywhile persuasion has zero gravity and cognitive resistance is frozen. Hit thebrain when its back is turned, and you can, quite literally, pretty much ‘nameyour price’.GOLDEN GAFFESThe neurology of incongruity – what happens inside the brain after the doorshave been forced and the windows blown in – is actually pretty well documented.14 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn14]Single-cell recordings inmonkeys have revealed that the amygdala is more sensitive to unexpectedpresentations of stimuli (both positive and negative) than expected 15[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn15]while in humans, intracranial EEGrecordings have demonstrated increased activation in both the amygdala and thetemporoparietal junction (a structure involved in novelty detection) on exposureto rare, especially bizarre, events. Indeed, as we saw in Chapter 2[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c02_r1.htm], incongruity, in the form of sudden andunexpected shifts in pitch, is what makes neonatal crying so emotive. 16[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn16]And gives music and humour theiredge.But there is, as hinted at earlier by the cupcakes study, a secondary functionof incongruity: one separate from, but not unrelated to, its facility forexplosive entry. Its capacity to ‘reframe’.17 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn17]Take, for instance, the twoadvertisements shown below in Figures 6.4a and 6.4b – both very different, yetboth, in their own way, very powerful.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_044_r1.jpg]Figure 6.4a, Figure 6.4b – Veils of the unexpected: the power of disconfirmationin adversity. (photo credit 6.4) [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c06-fig4a]Adverts such as these are emblematic of what we might call guerrilla influence.They ambush expectation and take our emotions hostage. They force us to askquestions. To re-evaluate.Usually when someone helps us they have a smile on their face. Not cuts andbruises. What’s going on?Usually when a car hire firm takes out copy space it’s to big itself up, not putitself down. What’s the deal?Drew Westen, Professor of Political Psychology at Emory University, has theanswer.‘If you want to win hearts and minds,’ he says, ‘start with the heart.’18 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn18]Westen and his co-workers havecarried out a series of studies looking at the effects of just such emotionalinvestment not in advertising, but in politics. What would happen, Westenwondered, if you took a group of diehard Republicans and a group of diehardDemocrats and presented them with pairs of statements – pairs of contradictorystatements – by their own party leaders. In the case of the Republicans, GeorgeW. Bush; and the Democrats, John Kerry.Would it bother them? If so, which ones would bother them?To find out, Westen did exactly that. In the run-up to the 2004 presidentialelection, he collated – from both sides of the party-political divide – aselection of incongruous arguments (12 in total, six vs six – and we’re talkingreal howlers here, not just minor inconsistencies) and showed them to bothRepublican and Democrat supporters alike, on a series of slides, while theyreclined in an fMRI machine.What he discovered was mind-boggling. To neutral observers, the contradictionswere obvious. As they were to the Republicans and Democrats – so long as theyoriginated on the other side of the aisle. But could Republicans discern theinconsistencies in their own candidate’s arguments? Likewise the Democrats? Nota chance. On a 1 to 4 scale (where 1 = not contradictory at all, and 4 =strongly contradictory), the average ratings for partisan statements hoveredaround 2. For opposition statements – you guessed it – they were close to 4.Republicans, in other words, could only see the glitches in Kerry’s rhetoric.And the Democrats, vice-versa, in Bush’s.More importantly, however, was what was going on inside participants’ headswhile they were exposed to such dissonance. To begin with, as Westen and histeam predicted, in the early stages of exposure (slides 1–3) incongruousideology generated a burst of negative emotion in the brain (specifically, inthe anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate,precuneus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex).But as the experiment wore on (slides 4–6) something very interesting started tohappen. The neural circuits involved in emotional regulation (the lateralinferior frontal cortex, inferior orbitofrontal cortex, insula, andparahippocampal gyrus) began to kick in. And kick in big time. And then, notonly did the initial negative emotion start to dissipate, areas of the brainassociated with positive emotion (the reward circuits of the ventral striatum)also showed up for the party. Participants didn’t just start to feel better.They started to feel good.No sooner, it seemed, had their brains recovered from the initial shock of theincongruity than they emotioned their way to reason, somehow reconciling the twoconflicting statements. And rewarded themselves for doing so.SHOCK AND/ORThe results of Drew Westen’s study shed quite a bit of light on what goes on inpersuasion. Not just in politics but in life in general. For starters, 19[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn19]facts aren’t always thatimportant. As influencers they’re overrated. When the chips are down and thegoing gets tough, the brain, it would seem, spends much of its time coweringbehind the heart. Just to reiterate: all the action in Westen’s study was in thebrain’s emotional ZIP codes. The cognitive neighbourhoods were quiet.In oratory, too, incongruity has a transformative quality. Contrasts such asthose used by John F. Kennedy (‘Ask not what your country can do for you, askwhat you can do for your country’) and Margaret Thatcher (‘You turn if you wantto, the lady’s not for turning’) make their points in bold because of theimmediate juxtaposition of positive and negative. 20[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn20]In fact, research has shown thatof the total applause generated by a well-crafted speech, a third, on average,is triggered by this kind of symmetry.Picture the scene as I jump on the New York subway one morning. Two beggars aresitting facing each other on opposite sides of the sidewalk. One is dressed inrags and is dejectedly holding up a sign which reads: Hungry and Homeless –Please Help. The other is dressed in an immaculate pin-stripe suit and –grinning smugly – is brandishing a placard saying: Filthy rich and want more!The reaction of passers-by is intriguing. It’s a mixture of disdain, sympathyand amusement. As a marketing strategy, the guy in the pinstripe is a disaster.His bowl is pretty much as empty as when he started. Yet the ‘real’ beggar – theguy dressed in rags – is raking it in.I’m suspicious. There’s definitely more to this little racket than meets theeye. So later, as they’re packing up, I approach them. What’s the story? I ask.Turns out I’m right. It is a racket.In fact both of them are on the streets.But they’ve discovered, through the psychology of what I think in the literatureis called ‘balls’, that by working together they can more than quadruple theirday’s takings.‘It gives people a choice,’ they tell me. ‘Rich guy or poor guy. Normally whathappens – when you’re on your own – is that people just walk straight by. Theyhardly even give you a second look. But the guy in the suit not only gets theirattention, it gets them thinking. Why would I give anything to him, the smugbastard, when I can give it to the other guy? Regulars know it’s a scam, but itstill works. We take it in turn who wears it.’Big covers small.CONFIDENCEKEEPING WATCHThe story that I’m about to tell next doesn’t exactly show my Uncle Fred in thebest of lights. But it’s such a great example of the transformative power ofconfidence that it’s difficult to leave it out.Fred Dutton served in the Parachute Regiment during the Second World War. Hewasn’t the biggest man in the world – around 5′6″, and nine stone wringing wet –but he was a tough little bugger and had the heart of a lion. One Christmas,somewhere deep in the Ardennes, he and three of his mates stumbled across aGerman position. Taken by surprise, the Germans decided to leg it – all exceptfor the radio operator who couldn’t get his backpack off in time. Fred was incharge and stepped forward.‘Stand up!’ he yelled at the signaller.The German did as he was told. He was 6′5″, and built, as Fred was fond ofsaying, like a brick shithouse. For a few seconds the two soldiers just stoodthere looking at each other. Quite literally, I guess, sizing each other up (ordown, as the case may be). It must have been quite a scene: Fred at 5′6″, Jurgenat 6′5″. Eventually, Fred’s eyes alighted upon the German’s watch. It was shiny.And gold. And looked expensive. There was no doubt whatsoever in Fred’s mindthat his mates would back him up if things turned nasty. So what the hell? hethought. He may as well go for it.‘Your watch!’ he barked at Jurgen. ‘Mine!’As an aid to translation he pointed at the watch. Then he pointed at himself.The German looked at him as if he were mad.‘Your watch!’ Fred repeated. ‘Hand it over!’Still the German just stood there, eyeballing him ever more suspiciously astheir bizarre standoff unfolded.Finally, Fred had had enough. Walking right up to within a few inches of theGerman – horizontally, if not vertically – he gesticulated furiously at hiswrist.‘YOUR WATCH!’ he hissed. ‘GIVE IT TO ME!’At the third time of asking the German, somewhat hesitantly, undid hiswatchstrap and handed the article over.Fred grabbed it, shoved it into the pocket of his greatcoat, and with a big smuggrin on his face turned round gleefully to his mates.Who’d absconded, he later found out, as soon as they’d seen the size of thebastard.OMNIA DICTA FORTIORA SI DICTA LATINA4Reality, wrote the American essayist Robert Anton Wilson, is what you can getaway with. And I’ll tell you something for nothing: Uncle Fred would almostcertainly have agreed with him. There was only one thing that convinced thatGerman radio operator to hand over his watch – and it wasn’t the festive spirit,that’s for sure. Raw confidence was what it was. No doubt about it. Well, rawmisplaced confidence actually.Someone else who knows a thing or two about confidence is Greg Morant. It’s asteamy summer’s evening in New Orleans as we sit in the bar of his five-starhotel sipping champagne. ‘Persuasion,’ Morant tells me, in crisp white shirt,pale blue jeans, and with a gold Oyster Perpetual twinkling on his wrist, ‘isninety-nine per cent confidence and one per cent coincidence!’ And Morant shouldknow better than anyone. Now in his mid-40s, he’s been hustling for 30 years.And there’s not a state in the Union he hasn’t quit while ahead.‘If you don’t trust someone, if you don’t have confidence that things will turnout as they say,’ Morant continues, ‘then what’s the point in listening to them?Now that’s no good to someone in my profession. Our bonds are our words! Did youhear the one about the confidence man who wasn’t confident? I mean, it’s crazy…’He’s right, of course. There’s nothing like confidence to inspire confidence.Take TV, for example. If you’ve ever wondered why experts interviewed ontelevision invariably appear against a backdrop of books – now you know. Theaccoutrements of knowledge lend their pronouncements that extra degree of oomph.21 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn21]Or take Stanley Milgram’selectric shocks experiment at Yale in the sixties. A staggering 65 per cent ofthose who took part in the study twisted that dial right the way round tomaximum when instructed to do so by a benign-looking professor in a white coat.But when the professor shuffled off and a lab technician took over – in jeans,T-shirt and sneakers – the ‘interrogators’ weren’t so keen. In a postscript tothe original study, in which the stamp of authority and the cues of scientificrectitude were ‘dumbed down’ (unlike the original study which was conducted inthe hallowed environs of Yale University’s ‘old’ campus, the follow-up tookplace in an office-block downtown), only 25 per cent of participants went thewhole way. Still pretty shocking, but hey – not as shocking.When confidence goes out of the window, everything else does too.A picture paints a thousand words, or so the saying goes. But is it possible fora picture to say too much? On the surface, this seems like an odd question. Butin the court-room, there’s evidence to suggest that the introduction of fMRIscans to the proceedings might actually be screwing things up. 22[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn22]A recent study by David McCabe ofColorado State University and Alan Castel of the University of California in LosAngeles suggests that whatever benefits brain-imaging pictures bestow upon thelegal process may in fact be outstripped by their propensity to dazzle.McCabe and Castel presented volunteers with a series of fictitious neurosciencearticles that included some dodgy reasoning (e.g. ‘watching TV helps with mathsability because both activate the temporal lobe’). Whereas some participantsreceived just the bad arguments, others received the arguments plus either brainimages or bar graphs. Guess who thought the articles made more sense? You gotit. Those who got the brain images.23 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn23]Statistics, used well, conveythe same psychological swagger. At the beginning of the O. J. Simpson murdertrial in 1995, the odds of an acquittal seemed pretty slim. But a brilliantdefence lawyer by the name of Alan Dershowitz had other ideas. Around 4 millionAmerican women were beaten up by their partners each year, he confidentlysubmitted to the court. But out of those 4 million only 1,432 (in 1992) hadactually been killed by their abusers. Given these figures, Dershowitz argued,it followed that the odds on his client being guilty were in fact around 1 in2,500.The jury were impressed by Dershowitz’s fiendish arithmetic. And Simpson, aftera trial lasting 251 days, walked out of court a free man.But the maths, it turned out, was wrong.And the data, unbeknown to the prosecution, concealed a radically differentpossibility. Since Nicole Brown Simpson was already dead, Dershowitz’s odds werefacing in the wrong direction.Of those 1,432 women who’d been murdered, 90 per cent had died at the hands oftheir partners.RING OF CONFIDENCE24 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn24]Psychologist Paul Zarnoth andhis co-workers at the University of Illinois have examined the effects ofconfidence on cognitive function. More specifically, how an aura ofself-assurance can envelop those around us in a nebulous cloud of truth. Zarnothpresented volunteers with various kinds of problems (e.g maths, analogy andforecasting tasks) and asked them, after each one, to indicate how confidentthey were that they’d got the answer correct. Volunteers responded first asindividuals, and then again in small groups. In neither case did they receiveany feedback about their performance.Zarnoth’s results were extraordinary. Group responses, he discovered, appearedto follow a pattern. They tended to mirror the individual responses of the mostconfident group members – even when they happened to be wrong. In other words,concluded Zarnoth, those individuals who were perceived as being the mostconfident were also the ones who were perceived as being the most competent –the most likely to have answered correctly.And it doesn’t take much to pick up on confidence. Surprisingly little, in fact.In politics, studies have shown that one of the strongest predictors ofcandidate popularity is approach behaviour; when, during a question and answersession for example, the candidate moves towards an audience (exuding asub-radar confidence and openness) as opposed to remaining stationary(signifying defensiveness.)526 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn26]Psychologists Nalini Ambady andRobert Rosenthal have taken things one stage further, and conducted researchinto something they call ‘thin slicing’. In one study, raters viewed 30-secondvideo clips of college lecturers at the beginning of an academic term andevaluated them on a number of personality variables. Would these minimalevaluations (or ‘thin slices’), Ambady and Rosenthal wanted to know, predict howthe lecturers did at the end of term – some three months down the road? Not,that is, in the eyes of the raters. But in those of the lecturers’ students.Remarkably, so it proved. Those lecturers initially perceived as confident,active, optimistic, likeable, and enthusiastic – after just 30 seconds, remember– fared far better on student evaluation forms later in the year.Oh, and I forgot to mention … even more remarkable was the fact that raters gavetheir initial ratings with the sound turned off. The videotapes had no audio.All participants had to go on was the evidence of their eyes.Confidence, like physical attractiveness, gives off a halo effect. It actsunilaterally as a standalone marker of influence.If it didn’t, then good old Uncle Fred would have been long gone.EMPATHYSMOKE WITHOUT FIREIt’s a Friday night and the London Underground is busy. For five minutes or so aPiccadilly Line train has been backed up in a tunnel between Leicester Squareand Covent Garden because of a signalling failure. The carriages are full andpeople are getting restless. Even more so now that the driver has just announceda further five-minute delay.A guy in a tracksuit takes out a cigarette and lights it – a real no-no.Ever since the King’s Cross inferno of 1987 which claimed the lives of 31people, and which – a subsequent inquiry revealed – was started by a discardedmatch, there’s been a blanket smoking ban on the Underground. But despite thefact that there are No Smoking signs all over the place, the guy lights upanyway.An uncomfortable silence descends upon the carriage. The looks on people’s facesspeak volumes. But no one – as so often proves the case – breathes a word. Then,out of the blue, a guy in a pinstripe suit breaks the curfew.‘Excuse me, ‘ he says, leaning forward with a cigarette, ‘you couldn’t, by anychance, give me a light, could you?’This, it transpires, is the final straw. Immediately, another passengerintervenes.‘You DO KNOW that you can’t smoke in here?’ he snaps.The guy in the suit suddenly ‘notices’ the No Smoking signs.‘Sorry,’ he says. ‘Didn’t realise.’Then he turns to the guy in the tracksuit.‘Maybe,’ he says, ‘we’d better put them out.’We’ve all been in situations like this, haven’t we? And often, unless you happento be made of sheet metal, the right course of action isn’t immediately obvious.Someone who’s prepared to nonchalantly light up a cigarette in a prohibited zoneis not, in all likelihood, going to ‘come quietly’. They’re going to put up afight.So what, in this case, does our fellow passenger do? Well, rather than choosingthe usual route of overt confrontation, he goes, instead, for the completeopposite. In direct contrast to what the guy in the tracksuit is expecting (achallenge) he joins him instead (‘Got a light?’) – knowing full well, of course,that such collusion is bound to provoke a reaction from one of the other peoplein the carriage. Which it does. But by the time that reaction materialises, thegame’s already up. Crucially, there’s now no longer just the one transgressor inthe frame, but two. The picture has changed dramatically. Suddenly, in the blinkof an eye, a makeshift ‘in-group’ has been created and there’s safety innumbers.The optimal outcome – getting the guy in the tracksuit to put out his cigarette– may be framed in terms of a friendly request from a fellow ‘unwittingoffender’ rather than as a full-on challenge from on high.And things return to normal.FACING FACTSIf the ingredients of effective persuasion were to be arranged like poker handsin order of strength, then the way we feel about someone would often rate higherthan what they say or do. Take what just happened on the Underground. The reasonwhy the guy on the Underground extinguished his cigarette wasn’t because he wastold to extinguish it (although that obviously had something to do with it). Itwas, instead, because of the way he was told. And by whom.Such an ability to customise a message so as to maximise its impact, to serve itup ‘warm’ to whoever it is meant for, calls for empathy, for a good workingknowledge of the principles of emotional synchrony, and there are two main waysyou can do it. First, you can reduce the psychological distance between yourselfand the recipient: increase similarity. Or you can frame what you say in such away as to make it more ‘personal’: increase salience.‘Wanna get a kid to eat potatoes?’ laughs master conman Greg Morant, as the slowSouthern twilight glints off his Rolex and he orders us more champagne. ‘Thenserve ‘em up as fries.’27 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn27]Lisa DeBruine at the Universityof Aberdeen’s Face Research Lab has conducted a fascinating investigation intothe mechanics of similarity. More specifically, into its effects on trust.What she did was as follows.28 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn28]First, DeBruine devised acomputer game for ‘two’ players. In the game, each individual player waspresented with a choice. They could either: 1. divide up – between themselves and their partner – a small sum of money personally; or 2. trust their partner to distribute a larger amount.The participants were assigned 16 different partners whose faces were displayedon a monitor. But there was a catch. Unbeknown to the participants, all of the‘partners’ who appeared on the screen in front of them had had their facesaltered using a face morphing technique (see Figure 6.5, overleaf). None ofthem, in other words, were ‘real’.But that wasn’t all. While half of these partners comprised a composite of twostrangers, the other half was different. In this other half, it was theparticipant’s own face that had been spliced with the stranger’s.What, DeBruine wondered, would be the pattern of participant choice? 29[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn29]Would they, as predicted by theprinciples of kin selection, be more willing to cede control to their ‘playingpartners’ when that partner more closely resembled themselves? Or would facialsimilarity have little bearing on trust?The results were pretty impressive. On average, DeBruine found that participantstrusted players with faces resembling their own on more than two-thirds of thetrials – compared with only half the time when the face on the screen wascompletely unfamiliar.Seeing ourselves in others can sometimes come at a price.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_045_r1.jpg]Figure 6.5 – Face morphing. Participants’ faces (left) were morphed with thefaces of strangers (right) to generate the composite faces (centre). The top andbottom panels provide examples of different gradations of morphing. The femalemorph (top) assimilates both shape and colour information from the participantand unfamiliar face, whereas the male morph (bottom) assimilates only shapeinformation from the unfamiliar face. (photo credit 6.5)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c06-fig5a]COMMON TOUCHIn the worlds of sales and marketing DeBruine’s revelations wouldn’t raise manyeyebrows. In crucibles of influence such as these it’s been known for quite sometime that similarity is the name of the game. And you know what? It doesn’tmatter where the overlap starts. It’s just enough that there is one.30 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn30]An amusing study whichdemonstrates this divided a bunch of students into two groups: those who weretold that Grigori Rasputin – the notorious ‘Mad Monk of Russia’ – happened toshare the same birthday as theirs, and those who were told that his birthdayfell on a different day. Each group then read an account of Rasputin’s dastardlydeeds and were subsequently asked to rate how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ he was. ThoughRasputin’s heinous CV was identical for both groups, which of the participantsdo you think rated him more positively? Correct – those who ‘shared’ hisbirthday.The results of studies such as these have strong implications for the way weinfluence others. On 20 January, 2009, in the 18 minutes 28 seconds thatcomprised Barack Obama’s inaugural address as President, those key, umbilicalutterances ‘we’ and ‘us’ and ‘our’ tumbled like sparks from his great oratoricalanvil – appearing, between them, a total of 155 times in the speech. ‘We’re allin this together’ was the subtext. The main text, even. Yoked one to another byhistory – by the Mayflower, by Gettysburg, by 9/11 – Americans face the futureside by side.More circumspect was Obama’s allusion to the ‘young preacher from Georgia’ inhis Democratic nomination speech. 31[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn31]By not referring to Martin LutherKing by name – a rhetorical technique known as antonomasia – he crafts, at astroke, an effortless intimacy between speaker and audience: the flatteringassumption that we’re all ‘insiders’ here, we all know who I mean. And look howthe term humanises King: there was a time, before he turned into stained glass,that he, too, was just an ordinary Joe like us. And how the mention of Georgia(a favourite trick of Obama) grounds and localises the rhetoric: ‘Ourcampaign … began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concordand the front porches of Charleston …’Politicians and salespeople make a point of drumming up empathy, of stakingtheir claim to oases of common ground, with good reason. Because it works. Andthe better the location for that common ground – the more meaningful or ‘prime’it happens to be – the more we want to buy into it.Once, going in to buy some shoes in Lexington, Kentucky, I ran into a salesassistant who grew up just two streets away from where I did - 5,000 miles awayin a tiny corner of West London. What a coincidence that turned out to be. Ifelt I almost had to buy a pair of shoes off him. And did. Two pairs, in fact.Couple of days later both were in the bin.And it doesn’t just work commercially. Not long ago, on a flight to the States,I sat next to a young, cool-looking guy of around 25 who wasn’t in the least bitconcerned that he had no street address to put down on his immigration form(such as is now the requirement).‘No problem,’ he said. ‘Just watch.’I wasn’t so sure. Standing behind him in the queue at JFK, I was all ears. Washe really going to pull it off? If so, how? There was the usual exchange ofinsults with the officer on the desk as she took his prints and photograph. Butthen, when she eventually got round to processing his form, he suddenly remarkedon her name.‘Wow – Verronica with two r’s! That’s amazing! The only other person I’ve everknown spell their name like that was my mum. That’s great!’The officer beamed. She agreed it was quite a coincidence. Know what? First timeshe, too, had come across another Verronica. She stamped his passport. Handed itback to him. And that, pretty much, was that. Bit of distraction. Bit ofempathy. And he was in.Exactly like he’d said.SIXTH SENSEI32 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn32]I have absolutely no doubt thatthere are mind-reading geniuses out there because I’ve met one of them. In thehigher echelons of the martial arts there’s a test. The test involves one mankneeling down – arms by his side, blindfolded – while another stands behind himwith a samurai sword raised aloft. At a moment of his choosing, the man standingbehind will bring down the sword on to the kneeling man’s head causing severeinjury, possibly death – unless, that is, the blow is somehow deflected and theswordsman subsequently disarmed.Such a feat appears tantamount to impossible. And yet, it isn’t. What I havedescribed is real: an ancient, impeccably choreographed test, carried out inremote dojos in Japan and the High Himalaya, that those approaching greatness –those sinewy sorcerers miles above the black belt – have to pass. These days,thankfully, the sword is made of plastic. But there was a time, many years ago,when it was the real thing.An ancient sensei, way into his 80s, told me the secret.‘One must empty one’s mind totally. One must focus purely on the now. When oneenters a state like that, one is able to smell time. To feel its waves washingover one’s senses. The tiniest ripple may be detected over great distances, andthe signal intercepted. Often it appears that the two combatants movesimultaneously. But this is not so. It is not difficult. With practice it can bemastered.’Equivalent empathic genius may also be attainable aurally, in the realm oflinguistics. A prostitute of over 20 years’ experience told me – strictly in theline of business – that she was able to gauge, within 30 seconds of talking tothem on the phone, whether or not a client posed a risk. Whether, in otherwords, it was safe to invite them round.‘I can’t explain it,’ she said. ‘It’s just something you pick up. And in thisbusiness it’s something you need to pick up – it could be the difference betweenlife and death. When I first started out, I used to get knocked about quite abit. But now it never happens. Soon as I hear a voice I start to build up apicture. I get a vibe. It’s like a sixth sense. And its very rarely wrong.’Most of us are never going to be this good at hacking into other people’s minds.Because most of us, thankfully, are never going to have to be this good. Buthere’s the deal. To influence others, you don’t need to be an expert mindreader. Sure, we each have our own individual frequencies on which the signalcomes through at its sharpest. But there’s also a network of shared wavelengthswhich all of us tune into.33 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn33]The importance of nailing theright frequency, the appropriate psychological bandwidth on which to transmitour message, is demonstrated in a study conducted by Victor Ottati at LoyolaUniversity and his co-workers at the University of Memphis. The study,ostensibly at least, examined the benefits of graduate theses requirements – butwas, in reality, all about figurative language. Ottati took a bunch of messageswith built-in sports metaphors (e.g. ‘If college students want to play ball withthe best, they shouldn’t miss out on this opportunity’) and compared them with abunch of neutral messages (e.g. ‘If college students want to work with the best,they shouldn’t miss out on this opportunity’). Which of these two message types,Ottati wanted to know, would spark the greater interest? And, what’s more, wouldbe considered by students as exerting the greater influence?The results were unequivocal. Analysis revealed that the messages containing thesports metaphors were not only processed more carefully – they also, subsequentto evaluation, had the greater impact on attitudes.But – and here’s the key – only for students who were sports fans. For those whoweren’t interested in sport, the metaphor blew up in their faces: attenuatinginterest in the issue of thesis requirement and considerably reducingpersuasion.‘The orator,’ observed Aristotle in the fourth century BCE, ‘persuades by meansof his hearers, when they are roused to emotion by his speech; for thejudgements we deliver are not the same as when we are influenced by joy orsorrow, love or hate.’Nowadays, of course, the data proves him right. Not least from fMRI.Recall, for example, Drew Westen’s ‘political divide’ study from earlier. Westenshowed us that if we happen, at the outset, to have a strong politicalallegiance to one particular party or another, then no amount of wrangling willget us to change our minds.The brain, intoxicated by empathy, simply chokes on its own logic.34 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn34]Recently, the CIA havediscovered a secret weapon in the war on terror: Viagra. Many Afghan warlordshave half a dozen wives, and maybe, someone realised, could do with a littleassistance. One official recalls a 60-year-old tribal leader welcoming him withopen arms having received, on a previous visit, a little box of tablets.‘He came up to me beaming, saying, “You are a great man.” Afterwards, we coulddo whatever we wanted in his area.’Simplicity, perceived self-interest, incongruity, confidence and empathy: if itcan stiffen resolve against the Taliban, just think what it could do for you.SPICE OF LIFE‘Why lie? I want beer!’‘You calling me fat?’PISS OFF – I’VE GOT ENOUGH FRIENDS!These three examples of what I call split-second persuasion each have somethingin common. All of them – yes, even the last one – elicit strong positiveemotions. As instruments of persuasion this bodes well. 35[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn35]Research has shown that one of thebiggest predictors of altruistic behaviour is current mood state – how you feelat the time. Feel good and the beggar gets lucky. Feel lousy and you scurrystraight past.Even when it comes to put-downs, the feel-good factor is key. When the legendaryAustralian fast bowler Glenn McGrath asked the Zimbabwean batsman Eddo Brandeshow come he’d gotten so fat, Brandes, with characteristic decorum, repliedrather eloquently that each time he screwed McGrath’s girlfriend she obliginglygave him a biscuit.Even the Australians laughed.In fact, they gave him a round of applause.Persuasion that makes you like it, makes you do it.The feel-good factor inherent to split-second persuasion is enshrined withineach of its modules. For some – confidence, empathy, perceived self-interest –this may perhaps seem rather obvious. But for simplicity and incongruity, theevidence is just as compelling. 36[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c06-ftn36]Research, for example, usingfacial electromyography (EMG) has demonstrated a direct correlation between thefluency with which a stimulus is processed and increased activation of thezygomaticus major – or ‘smiling’ – muscle. Moreover, when a stimulus isprocessed unexpectedly fluently (think: dropping in on a neighbour at homeversus bumping into them at the ball game) the tremors of positive emotion – thefeeling of familiarity – reverberate even deeper.This, in split-second persuasion, is why humour is often effective. When someoneendeavours to change something about us – and our minds are no exception – theprocess, more often than not, turns out to be less than pleasurable. But if, onthe other hand, the process turns out to be smooth – and in some cases, evenenjoyable: ‘Why lie? I want beer!’ versus ‘Vietnam vet … six months to live’ –then we’re not only likely to see where that person is ‘coming from’: we’relikely to want to go visit.Orthographically, the position of incongruity at the centre of the SPICE modelis also reflected dynamically. From calming someone down to raising someone’sspirits, from closing the deal to trying to bum a quarter on the street,defiance of expectation, script reversal, antithesis – call it what you will –lies right at the very heart of split-second persuasion. Not only, as we’ve justnoted, does it enhance the aesthetic prowess of simplicity, it also, as we sawearlier, knocks out the brain’s surveillance mechanisms – enabling the rest ofthe SPICE model task-force to slip in secretly subradar, and hotwire our neuralpleasure centres.The effects are irresistible. The result is a persuasion that doesn’t just takethe brain hostage. It actually makes us not want to pay the ransom.Think flipping point rather than tipping point.Mind-jacking instead of mind-hacking.Persuasion as nature intended – before language dumbed it down.During the Second World War, German bombers were an all-too-familiar sight inthe night-time skies over London, and parts of the city were completely razed tothe ground. One area particularly badly hit was the East End.One morning, after a not untypical night before, Whitechapel High Street lay inruins. As, one might have expected, would the spirit of its residents. Not so.In the window of a grocer’s store – in fact, in the only pane of glass stillleft in the building – the proprietor had posted the following:IF YOU THINK THIS IS BAD, YOU SHOULD SEE OUR BERLIN BRANCH!Indomitable. Inviolable. Irresistible.The SPICE of life, it’s called.SUMMARYIn this chapter, we decoded the secret structure of persuasion. We sequenced thegenome of the most powerful strain of influence on the planet, and uncovered anucleus comprising five core factors. These factors (simplicity, perceivedself-interest, incongruity, confidence and empathy: or SPICE for short) arepersuasion at 10, when it’s usually at 6 or 7 – and when deployed in unison,dramatically increase the chances of us getting what we want.In the next chapter [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c07_r1.htm] we turn our attentionaway from theoretical models – and on to individuals. So far in this book we’vemet a number of people for whom persuasion is a profession: for some the kindthat pays a monthly salary; for others the kind that nets illegal millions.What is it about these latter individuals that sets them apart from the rest?That enables them to breach our brains’ most sophisticated surveillance systemswithout us even noticing?The answer may surprise you.Prepare to meet … the psychopath.Card Trick – Which is the missing card?Could it be the one that you chose?[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_046_r1.jpg]1 Aficionados of Gary Larson’s Far Side may have come across a similar line intheir favourite cartoon series.

You’re scared of what they’ll do to you when they come knockingat your door. You’re scared of me.‘I mean, look at you. You’re right. You’re out there, I’m in here. But who’sfree, Kev? I mean, really free? You or me? Think about that tonight. Where arethe real bars, Kev? Out there’ – he points at the window – ‘Or in here?’ Hereaches forward and, ever so lightly, touches my left temple.’SUPERSANITYDeep in the neurobiological cosmos, the brain of the psychopath is glimpsed inremote orbit, a moonless world of glacial desolation and eerie mathematicalcharm. No sooner is the word out than images of serial killers, rapists, suicidebombers and gangsters come scything across our minds.But what if I were to paint you a different picture?What if I were to tell you that the psychopath who rapes your girlfriend mightalso, on another day, be the person most likely to rescue her from a burningbuilding? Or that the psychopath of today who lurks with a machete in a dimlylit parking lot may well be the Special Forces hero of tomorrow – using thatvery same weapon in hand-to-hand combat in Afghanistan? Or that the super-coolemotional assassin, the shadowy ambassador of charm whose mentholated morals andlightning sleight of mind robbed you blind of your entire life’s savings, mightalso, if they put their mind to it, save you from going under?Claims like this stretch credulity to the limit. And yet they’re true. Unliketheir box-office counterparts, not all psychopaths are violent. Far from it.Merciless and fearless, maybe. But violence is on a different neural freeway.One which sometimes has an interchange with psychopathy, but which just as oftenpasses overhead.Then, of course, there’s charisma. The psychopath’s famous ‘presence’.Devastating. Dazzling. Disarming. These are the kinds of character referencesone often hears about such individuals. Not, as one might expect, fromthemselves but from their victims.The irony is plain as day. Guys like these (and it usually is a guy)1 appear,through some ghoulish trick of nature, to possess the very personalitycharacteristics that many of us would die for. Indeed, that many who’ve fallenunder the spell of a psychopath have died for.They possess immense poise under pressure – their refrigerated hearts barelyskipping a beat under conditions of even the gravest danger. They are charming,confident, ruthless and remorseless. And remorseless. Out totally forthemselves. No matter what.They are also the kings of persuasion.WILL THE REAL PSYCHOPATH PLEASE STEP FORWARD …Let’s get one thing straight right from the start. Being a psychopath doesn’tmake you a criminal. Not by default, at any rate. And it doesn’t make you aserial killer either. In fact, many psychopaths aren’t even in prison – they’reout there locking others up. This often comes as a surprise to many people, butit’s true. A bit like the areas on a subway map there are, in fact, inner andouter zones of the disorder, with only a small minority resident in the ‘innercity’. Psychopathy is a spectrum along which each of us has our place. And justlike any scale or dimension, it’s going to have its A-listers.The assumption that there exists a dichotomy between psychopath andnon-psychopath is descended from the lineage of clinical diagnosis – more oftenthan not within a forensic setting – using standardised psychometric scales. 1[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn1]The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised(PCL-R) is a specialised, and well-established, questionnaire originallydeveloped for clinical use by the Canadian psychologist Robert Hare. It measurescore psychopathic traits such as charm, persuasiveness, fearlessness, lack ofempathy, and absence of conscience. On its 40-point scale, members of thegeneral population will typically register around four or five – whereas a scoreof 30 is generally considered the entry level for psychopaths.In clinical settings, as indicated by performance on the PCL-R, ‘home run’psychopaths – the Mikes of this world – knock the ball clean out of the stadium.There is, no question, a world of difference between these guys and the rest ofus. But the problem with this is that we don’t all live in rarefied clinicalsettings. And while Hannibal Lecter is serving up liver for breakfast, thetraits that mark these ‘pure’ psychopaths out from the rest of us happen, likepersonality traits in general, to be distributed evenly across the generalpopulation as a whole. Just as there’s no official border between someone whoplays the piano and a concert pianist, or between someone who plays tennis and,say, a Roger Federer or a Rafa Nadal, so the frontier between a ‘world-class’psychopath and someone who merely ‘psychopathises’ is similarly blurred.Think about it. One individual, for example, may be extremely cool underpressure, and demonstrate a sublime lack of empathy (and we’ll see a little bitlater how that pans out on the trading floor), but at the same time act neitherviolently, anti-socially, nor without conscience. High on two psychopathiccharacteristics, he or she might therefore be considered further along the‘psychopathic spectrum’ than someone scoring lower on those two traits, butwouldn’t fall within the ‘danger zone’ of someone scoring high on all of them.Like the dials on a studio mixing deck, the ‘soundtrack’ of personality isgraded.2 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn2]Psychologists Scott Lilienfeldand Brian Andrews have devised an alternative test to the PCL-R based preciselyon such a soundtrack. Better suited to detecting the presence of psychopathictraits among the non-clinical population (in those not so much behind bars aspropping them up), the Psychopathy Personality Inventory (PPI) provides a moresensitive measure of psychopathic traits: the existential emphasis beingpredominantly on psychopathy as a continuous predisposition rather than astandalone disorder.This, of course, has profound implications for the way we approach thecondition.Is psychopathy an all-or-nothing affair? Or more like a virus, where we can‘test positive’ yet not exhibit the fullblown array of symptoms? Are psychopathsqualitatively different from the rest of us – or just at the deep end of arather murky gene pool?And is it possible that far from posing a danger to individuals, or society ingeneral, psychopaths might actually have something special to offer: that theright combination of psychopathic traits, sampled and mixed at carefullycalibrated volumes, might put us ahead of the game?It’s this latter observation that makes the psychopath such a mystery toscientists. When, as a post-grad, their subemotional profiles first appeared onmy radar, it was the psychopath’s psychological cat-burgling skills thatintrigued me most of all. A core trait measured by all indices of psychopathy isthe ability to persuade: the capacity to influence others.Yet here’s the deal. These measures, as we’ve seen, also gauge levels ofempathy. Which is odd.How, I wondered, could anyone lacking empathy be so brilliant at socialinfluence? Psychopaths are recognised as being the best in the business atknowing what makes us tick. At getting under our skin. At getting inside ourheads. Take Keith Barrett, for instance. Or Mike, whom you’ve just met. Mike hadraped eight women, and killed two. He was, as the psychiatrist alluded to, areal-life Hannibal Lecter. A psychological black belt not to be messed with,which I discovered to my cost.But in order to run their software – their programs of persuasion – Keith andMike must first have acquired the hardware. And not just any old hardware – thehardware of empathy. Difficult to come by if you’re a psychopath.Suddenly, it got me thinking. If SPICE really was a universal model ofinfluence, then what, precisely, were the psychopaths up to?HIDDEN SHALLOWSThe advent of sophisticated brain imaging techniques such as Functional MagneticResonance Imaging (fMRI) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has sometimes beenlikened to the lunar landing. Finally, at our fingertips, we have the technologyto launch ourselves not into outer but inner space. That will allow us to ‘land’on that mysterious grey planet that each of us knows so well – yet few of us, upuntil now, have ever properly explored: the world between our ears. But someworlds, quite clearly, are more hospitable than others. And some, just liketheir cosmological counterparts, seem far better suited to supporting life thanothers. Some are warm, bright, and quite easily habitable. Some seem polar,dark, remote – barely recognisable in the outer fringes of the neurobiologicalfirmament.One such world is the world of the clinical psychopath.It’s often difficult to appreciate the sheer magnitude of difference between theworld of the ‘pure’ psychopath – the psychopathic A-lister – and thenon-psychopath. Former US Marine and nightclub bouncer David Bieber ‘calmly’gunned down a traffic cop with a single shot to the head as the terrifiedconstable, bloodied and badly injured, pleaded for his life just inches awayfrom the trigger. A police-car radio picked up the officer’s final, desperatewords: ‘Please, don’t shoot me. No …’ before Bieber opened fire.Committing him for sentence, the trial judge told Bieber he had shown ‘noremorse or understanding of the brutality of his crime’ and that he continued tomaintain a ‘cool and detached’ demeanour when attempting to explain the evidenceagainst him.Another psycopath, 24-year-old Tara Haigh, handed a life sentence in 2008 forsmothering her three-year-old son to death with a pillow, was on an internetdating site just hours after the murder. She posted a message on the site sayingher son had died from a tumour behind the ear – then proceeded to fix up arendezvous.This, in case you didn’t know, is the kind of people we’re dealing with.Examples such as these, so far beyond the pale of normal human experience as todefy comprehension, provide graphic depictions of the psychopath’s lack ofempathy.Or do they?Actually, research suggests that there may be a bit more to it. And that, farfrom being an open-and-shut case, the question of whether psychopaths lackempathy or not depends, in fact, on what kind of empathy we’re talking about.3 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn3]There are two types: ‘hot’ and‘cold’.Hot empathy involves feeling. It’s the kind of empathy that we ‘feel’ when wesee others performing a task, and appropriates precisely the same ‘shared’somatosensory brain circuits – plus the amygdala (the emotion-processing area ofthe brain) – as those that become active when we perform that task ourselves.Cold empathy, in contrast, involves calculation. It refers to the ability togauge, cognitively and dispassionately, what another person may be thinking andinvolves completely separate pieces of neural circuitry: primarily, the anteriorparacingulate cortex, the temporal pole and the superior temporal sulcus.There’s a world of difference.Hot empathy without cold empathy is the metre without the verse. Cold empathywithout hot empathy is the verse without the metre. The total opposite. It’slike having a highly detailed map without the first-hand experience of what thesymbols on that map relate to. You can still read it, still get around. But itdoesn’t mean anything.One psychopath I spoke to put it like this. ‘Even the colour-blind,’ he said,‘know when to stop at a traffic light. You’d be surprised. I’ve got hiddenshallows.’RIGHT TRACK?4 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn4]The comparison betweenpsychopaths and non-psychopaths with regard to hot and cold empathy may best beillustrated through the results of brain-imaging studies.5 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn5]Consider, for example, thefollowing scenario (Case 1), first proposed by the British moral philosopherPhilippa Foot.A trolley is running out of control down a track. In its path are five peoplewho have been tied to the track by a mad philosopher. Fortunately, you can flicka switch that will lead the trolley down a fork in the track to safety.Unfortunately, there is a single person tied to that fork.Question: Should you hit the switch?Most people have little trouble in deciding what to do in this scenario. Thoughthe thought of flicking the switch is unpalatable, the utilitarian option –killing just the one person – represents the ‘least worst choice’.Agreed?6 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn6]Now consider the followingscenario (Case 2), – proposed by the American moral philosopher Judith JarvisThomson:As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. But thistime, you are standing behind a very large stranger on a footbridge above thetracks. The only way to save the five people is to push the stranger. He willfall to a certain death – but his considerable bulk will block the trolley,saving five lives.Question: Should you push him?Here, there is what we might call a ‘genuine’ dilemma. Although the score inlives is precisely the same as in the first scenario (five to one), one’s choiceof action is far trickier. Yet why should this be?7 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn7]Harvard psychologist JoshuaGreene believes he has the answer, and it boils down to temperature. The reason,Greene suggests, is reflected in brain architecture – in the respective parts ofthe brain implicated in the resolution of each dilemma.Case 1, he proposes, is what we might call an impersonal moral dilemma andinvolves those areas of the brain primarily responsible for reasoning andrational thought: the prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. This, ifyou recall, is the circuitry of cold empathy.Case 2, on the other hand, is what we might call a personal moral dilemma andinvolves the emotion centre of the brain. The amygdala. The circuit of hotempathy.Just like you or me, psychopaths have relatively few problems with Case 1. Theyflick the switch and the train diverts accordingly – killing just the one personinstead of five. However – and this is where it gets interesting – quite unlikeyou or me, they also experience little difficulty with Case 2. Psychopaths,without a moment’s hesitation, are perfectly happy to shove the fat guy over therails if that’s what the doctor orders.Moreover, this difference in behaviour has a distinct neural signature. Thepattern of brain activation in both ourselves and psychopaths is identical onthe presentation of impersonal-moral dilemmas, but radically different when itcomes to personal-moral dilemmas.Imagine that I were to hook you up to an fMRI machine and then present you withthe two dilemmas, first one, then the other. What would I observe as you wentabout trying to solve them?Well, at the precise moment that the nature of the dilemma changed fromimpersonal to personal, I would see your amygdala and related brain circuits –your medial orbitofrontal cortex, for example – light up like Christmas trees.The moment, in other words, that emotion kicks in.8 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn8]But in psychopaths I would seenothing. The house would remain in darkness, and the passage from impersonal topersonal would slip by unnoticed.EMOTIONAL CALCULUS9 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn9]Similar work in the field of faceprocessing has been conducted by Heather Gordon and her co-workers at the Centrefor Cognitive Neuroscience, Dartmouth College. On an emotion recognition task(in which participants had to match a series of facial expressions presented tothem on a computer screen) Gordon compared the performances of high and lowscorers on the Psychopathy Personality Inventory (PPI) – a test, as we sawearlier, specifically designed to detect the presence of sub-clinicalpsychopathic traits within the general population.Then, using fMRI, she peered into their brains to see what was going on.What she discovered was intriguing. While, on the one hand, those scoring highon the test displayed decreased amygdala activity compared to those who scoredlower (consonant with a deficit in ‘hot’ emotional processing), they alsoexhibited increased activity in both the visual and dorsolateral prefrontalcortices – indicative, as Gordon and her colleagues point out, of ‘high-scoringparticipants relying on regions associated with perception and cognition to dothe emotion recognition task’ (see Figure 7.1 below).[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_047_r1.jpg]Figure 7.1 – Blood oxygen level dependent activity during the emotionrecognition condition relative to a resting baseline. (photo credit 7.1)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c07-fig1a]More intriguingly still, perhaps, when it came to recognition accuracy, Gordonand her team turned up … nothing. Unlike with patterns of brain activity, theyfound no overt performance differences between those high and low onpsychopathic traits – which strongly suggests that whatever strategy thepsychopaths happened to be using in decoding those emotional expressions workedjust fine.10 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn10]Simon Baron-Cohen, apsychologist at the University of Cambridge, has taken things one stage further.The ‘Reading the Mind in the Eyes’ test requires individuals to view photographsof the eye-region of faces and to deduce, from this information alone, themental state of the individual in the photograph.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_048_r1.jpg]Figure 7.2 – ‘Reading the Mind in the Eyes’ test. What emotion is being conveyedin the following three pictures? Select from the four options below each one.(photo credit 7.2) [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c07-fig2a]Not as easy as it sounds, is it? Most people get around two out of three (andactually, these aren’t exactly the simplest examples I could have choseneither). One out of three and you’re doing well here. (Answers at the bottom ofthe page.)*The Reading the Mind in the Eyes test represents, as you’ve probably alreadyguessed, a good index of the cold, as opposed to hot, empathy that we’ve justbeen talking about. Participants, after all, don’t have to feel the emotion inthe pictures. They simply have to recognise it.Such being the case, Baron-Cohen had a brainwave. How, he wondered, incomparison with the rest of us, might psychopaths fare on the test? In light ofthe brain imaging results from earlier, one would imagine that the performanceof psychopaths should be pretty much indistinguishable from that of the generalpopulation as a whole.But how would things go in the lab?To find out, Baron-Cohen visited three London prisons and pitted 19 psychopathicinmates against 18 non-psychopathic controls. He presented each individual with40 photographs of eye regions and asked them, as above, to identify the emotionin each one.Who would come out on top? Would the Starlings beat the Lecters? Or would thepsychopaths hold their own?The results were unequivocal. Exactly as predicted, Baron-Cohen found nodifference whatsoever between psychopaths and non-psychopaths. It was a tie.Plus a further indication, to go with the fMRI data, that although psychopathsmay be unable to feel empathy, the concept, at least, is glacially preserved intheir brains.‘I can read your brain like a subway map,’ Keith Barrett told me in hismarble-floored hotel room overlooking New York’s Fifth Avenue. ‘Shuffle it likea deck of cards. That’s who I am. A psychological croupier. I deal the cards.Spin the wheel. Give out the chips. Then I sit back and watch what happens. Whyshould I feel anxious? Or bad? In fact, why should I feel anything? Nobody beatsthe house. Not in the long run … You’d be surprised at how similar people are toslot machines. Know when to hold, when to nudge – and the tokens come pouringout. Emotion … that’s for pussies.’KILLING IN THE MARKETWhen one considers the circumstances under which much persuasion takes place(courtrooms, boardrooms, incident rooms and bedrooms – to name just a few), it’sperhaps not difficult to imagine how the psychopath’s unique capacity to gauge,but not feel, emotion – to fly on only the one engine – may well confer anadvantage. Such crystalline neurobiology as theirs is able to take, quiteliterally, the heat out of the moment. And allow them, in tight situations wherecool, peppermint logic is at a premium, to zone in on details that the rest ofus might miss. Plus, of course, to take chances – to come up with the line therest of us might ‘think better’ of.‘I’m the coldest son-of-a-bitch you’ll ever meet,’ said Ted Bundy, who killed,decapitated and screwed – in that order -35 women over a four-year period.2And he was right.But there are times, quite clearly, when that coldness comes in handy: wheninstead of actually costing lives, as in Bundy’s case, it can, in contrast, savethem.The equity premium puzzle has long baffled financial experts. This is thetendency for large numbers of investors to invest in bonds as opposed toequities – especially during periods of stock-market decline – despite the factthat the latter, over time, have shown far better rates of return. Suchconundrums as this – known as myopic loss aversion – have provided the impetusfor a new, and somewhat timely, field of study: neuroeconomics.Neuroeconomics focuses on the mental processes that drive financialdecision-making – and the primary finding so far has been that emotion ischicken. Emotion, it would seem, is so oriented towards risk-aversion that evenwhen the benefits outweigh the losses it henpecks our brains into erring on theside of caution. If Spock were a trader, consensus is beginning to form, he’dclean the rest of us out.11 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn11]A 2005 study, conducted by ajoint team from Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University and theUniversity of Iowa, provides fascinating empirical evidence for such a claim.The study comprises a gambling game consisting of 20 rounds. At the start of thegame participants are given the sum of $20 and, at the beginning of each newround, are asked whether they are prepared to risk $1 on the toss of a coin.While a loss incurs the penalty of only $1, a win reaps the grand reward of$2.50.‘Logically,’ says Baba Shiv, Associate Professor of Marketing at StanfordUniversity, ‘the right thing to do is to invest in every round.’But logic, as we know, doesn’t always prevail.At the beginning of the study, participants are divided into two groups: thosewith lesions in the emotion areas of the brain (the amygdala, the orbitofrontalcortex, and the right insular or somatosensory cortex) and those with lesions inother areas (the right or left dorsolateral sector of the prefrontal cortex).If, as neuroeconomic theory suggests, emotion really is responsible for riskaversion then, according to the dynamics of the game, those participants withthe relevant presenting pathology (i.e. the first group) should outperform thosewithout (i.e. the second group).This, it turns out, is exactly what happens.As the game unfolds, ‘normal’ participants begin declining the opportunity togamble, preferring to conserve their winnings. In contrast, those with problemsin their brains’ emotional ZIP codes keep going – ending the game with asignificantly higher profit margin than their competitors.‘This may be the first study,’ says George Loewenstein, Professor of Economicsat Carnegie Mellon, ‘that documents a situation in which people with braindamage make better financial decisions than normal people.’Antoine Bechara, Professor of Neurology at the University of Iowa, makes an evenmore startling claim:Research needs to determine the circumstances in which emotions can be useful ordisruptive, [in which they] can be a guide for human behavior … The mostsuccessful stockbrokers might plausibly be termed ‘functional psychopaths’ –individuals who on the one hand are either more adept at controlling theiremotions or who, on the other, do not experience them to the same degree ofintensity as others.And Baba Shiv agrees. ‘Many CEOs,’ he says unnervingly, ‘and many top lawyersmight also share this trait.’WIRED FOR CONFIDENCEShiv and Bechara’s comments make sense. The Arctic genius whose unblinking,remorseless neurology allows them to decouple feeling from thinking with theease of untying a shoelace is, when the chips are down, going to leave the restof us for dead. Sometimes quite literally.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_049_r1.jpg]Figure 7.3 – ‘Lift going up?’ (photo credit 7.3)[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm4_r1.htm#c07-fig3a]Bill Gates (not someone a lay person would ordinarily label a psychopath butcertainly, in business, someone who’s empathy channel appears muted) wasrecently interviewed on television. You’re a billion-dollar, multinationalcorporation, the presenter protested. Why do you have to crush the small guys –the two friends starting a company in their bedrooms? Why do you have to win10–0 all the time? Gates looked at her as if she was crazy.‘I take that as a compliment,’ he said.But the psychopath’s sub-zero brain temperature, their facility for neuralcruise control, doesn’t just impact on empathy. A recumbent amygdala hasadditional benefits, too – most notably when it comes to another of the SPICEcomponents, confidence. Remember, not all psychopaths are behind bars – they’reonly the ones who engage in criminal activities and get caught. Many arelaw-abiding citizens out there in the workplace, excelling in high-riskoccupations such as litigation, big business, the armed forces and the media,for one simple reason: their confidence to thrive under what, to less resilientindividuals, may seem like conditions of brutal, intolerable stress.Neurosurgery is commonly regarded as one of the riskiest forms of surgery anindividual can undergo. Operating in hostile environments deep within the brain,the neurosurgeon must aim for absolute precision – with margins of error lessthan a sniper’s bullet. It’s no place for the fainthearted. So who are thepeople who ‘cut it’ in this profession – who patrol the remote borders betweenconsciousness, self and soul?A clue comes from Andrew Thompson, a neurosurgeon for 22 years – who again,though not resident in psychopathy’s ‘inner city’, certainly scores high onruthless self-belief:I would be being less than honest if I said that I didn’t get a kick out of thechallenge. Surgery is a blood sport, and playing safe all the time just isn’t inmy nature … But one cannot allow oneself to become paralysed by fear ifsomething goes wrong. There’s no place for panic in the heat of battle. One muststrive for 100 per cent concentration no matter what the eventuality. One mustbe remorseless, and have the utmost confidence in oneself to do one’s job … thebrain represents the high seas of modern-day medicine, and twenty-first-centurybrain surgeons its pirates and buccaneers.Thompson’s comments may come as a shock to those about to undergo surgery. Butthey shouldn’t. Sentiments like these are actually quite common among those atthe business end of their professions – as the Harvard researcher StanleyRachman discovered in a series of studies conducted back in the eighties.12 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn12]Rachman’s studies are nowregarded as classics, not least for his choice of participants: bomb-disposalexperts. What attributes, Rachman wanted to know, did such a profession demand?What, if anything, differentiates the ‘great’ bomb-disposal expert from themerely ‘good’ one?Rachman’s research uncovered something very interesting. Starting with a groupof experienced bomb-disposal experts – those with ten years or more in the field– he began to observe a fundamental difference between those who’d beendecorated for their work and those who hadn’t. What’s more, the nature of thisdifference seemed rooted in basic physiology. Rachman noticed that onassignments deserving of higher attentional resources – those, in other words,at the sharp end of the risk spectrum – the heart-rates of those who had notbeen decorated remained stable.An extraordinary finding.But even more extraordinary was what happened to the heart-rates of those whohad been decorated. Far from remaining stable, they actually went down. Moredetailed analyses – of the impact of certain types of personality variables oncardiovascular performance – revealed the reason why. There was, it turned out,not just the one factor in the mix, but two. Sure, Rachman discovered, someindividuals may well, through the sheer law of averages, have ice runningthrough their veins.But the one defining attribute – the single most important thing that above allothers seemed to make a difference – was confidence.Confidence, of course, helps us out in all walks of life. You don’t need a timerand a web of dodgy fuse wire to figure that one out. Nor a scalpel nor a cranialsaw. On the golf course, in the job interview, on the trading floor, on thedance floor – it’s belief in one’s own ability just as much as that abilityitself that often tips the balance. Just ask the victims of some of the world’sbest conmen.13 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn13]Robert Hendy-Freegard is theHannibal Lecter of confidence-tricksters. Such are his powers of persuasion thathe has, within his high-security residence, been moved to solitary confinementto prevent both his fellow prison inmates – and prison staff – from fallingunder his spell.Over a period of almost a decade, the car salesman-turned-conman managed toconvince his victims that he was an MI5 operative conducting an undercovercampaign against the IRA. And that he could, if they so wished, recruit them,too, into the British Secret Service. Meanwhile, the money he needed ‘to protectstate security’ was winging its way out of their bank accounts.‘The most accomplished liar I have ever encountered in twenty-five years in thepolice’ was how Scotland Yard detective Robert Brandon described Hendy-Freegard.‘When he started he’d be charming; he’d listen and listen, and find any weaknessin character, any vulnerability, and then he would ruthlessly exploit that. Whenhe had control of his victims, he went to whatever ends he possibly could totake all their money and all their dignity.’Even more ‘impressive’ is the fact that some of these victims – who included achild psychologist – were extremely well educated. Hendy-Freegard himself leftschool at 14.So how did he do it? One of his casualties provides a clue.‘His confidence was irresistible,’ she recalls. ‘His demeanour completelyinfectious.’Andrew West, who spearheaded the case for the prosecution, provides another.‘I struggled to understand it,’ he said at the conclusion of the trial. ‘But heis very plausible. And even when he gave evidence he appeared very convincing.’Which just goes to show, as another psychopathic conman I spoke to put it (withonly the merest hint of irony): ‘Anyone can be the part. But can you act it?’THE NORMAL AND THE NUTSIn 1964, the British playwright Joe Orton penned his much-acclaimed dramaEntertaining Mr Sloane. In the play, the charismatic psychopath Mr Sloane comesto live with a lonely brother and sister, and begins desultory affairs withboth. Of his character, Orton wrote the following: ‘He has to be lethal andcharming. A combination of magical black leather meanness and boyish innocence.’Which is as good a portrayal of the psychopath as any you’re likely to see.Orton’s profile of the mercurial Mr Sloane captures a facet of the psychopathicpersonality that is universal across many members of the species: an incongruousmelange of the normal and the nuts.‘14 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn14]You may have spotted them inyour workplace,’ writes David Baines in the magazine Canadian Business. ‘Theyare intelligent, charismatic, attractive and socially skilled. They make greatfirst impressions. They are spontaneous and uninhibited by rules. They are funto hang around with – at least initially … [but] behind the charisma, there isno conscience.’Such incongruity is hypnotic. The allure of the psychopath is derived in nosmall part from their similarity to ourselves. Crossed, that is, with theirobvious dissimilarity.Patricia Davidson, a 44-year-old sales assistant from Wichita, Kansas, tells anall too familiar story – about how she upped sticks to Chicago, Illinois to datea man serving life for a brutal gangland killing.‘Did he do it?’ I asked her.‘Yeah,’ she said. ‘He did it. But he was never like that with me. He was a realromantic, writing me poems and stuff. He made me feel I was special. Like I wasthe one he’d been waiting for.’She wasn’t. Six weeks later the relationship had petered out. Several otherwomen had crept out of the woodwork, and Davidson had rolled back west.Black leather meanness meets boyish innocence. It’s a dangerous combination.3COLD CALLERThe veneer of charm that makes the psychopath so beguiling also makes forexcellent psychological camouflage. And when combined with demonic confidence itcan be lethal.Liam Spencer is a 20-year-old ‘apprentice’ A-lister – a protégé of Greg Morantwhom we met in the previous chapter [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c06_r1.htm].Morant, among others, is teaching him the tricks of the trade, and six months inis already tipping him for greatness.‘He’s a natural,’ says Morant. ‘Ice cool, and with a predator’s eye forweakness. Everyone’s got an Achilles heel, it’s just a matter of findingit … Liam’s a bit quicker than most.’Spencer is impressive. Tall, good-looking, and impeccably turned out in navyArmani pinstripe and white, open-necked shirt, he hands me back my wallet fiveminutes after we sit down. By which time, of course, he’s already bought thedrinks.I ask him about his success with women – on a tip-off from Morant. Spencer is aman for whom getting a date on a Friday night is a sport. And he’s pretty goodat it, too – hardly surprising given the kinds of methods he uses.Here’s one of them, which he tells me over cocktails on the terrace.Step 1: Check out local neighbourhoods providing likely catchment areas ofsingle women living alone – places around hospitals, universities, etc.Step 2: Around 8 p.m. on a Friday evening, turn up unannounced at a pre-selectedaddress with a bottle of wine and a reservation for two at one of the smarterrestaurants in town.Step 3: If a guy comes to the door, apologise, say you’ve got the wrong house,and start again somewhere else.Step 4: If a girl answers, ask if ‘Carmilla’ (or similarly unusual name) is athome. She won’t be – because ‘Carmilla’ doesn’t exist.Step 5: On being told that there’s no ‘Carmilla’ at that address, explain – witha carefully crafted, well-practised blend of disappointment and embarrassment –that you met Carmilla in a bar several days ago, had asked her out to dinnerthis evening, and that this was the address she’d given you. Damn – you’ve beenstood up!Step 6: Stir in a pinch of humour: ‘I knew I was too good for her!’Step 7: Wait for a reaction. Chances are it will be sympathetic (if not,apologise for the intrusion and move on).Step 8: Add a dash of opportunistic hope to your disappointment andembarrassment. Something like: ‘Er, I know this might sound crazy but, if youdon’t have any plans tonight (at 8 p.m. on a Friday evening chances are shewon’t have) and seeing that I’m here, I don’t suppose you might like to join me…’Step 9: Table for two.Spencer’s technique combines all five components of the SPICE model into aMichelin-starred casserole of con.Simplicity and perceived self-interest: goes without saying.Incongruity: how often does a good-looking, well-dressed, funny, and (mostimportant of all) conveniently available knight in shining Armani turn up atyour door on a Friday night? With, as if all that weren’t enough, a to-die-forreservation for dinner?Confidence: could you do it?Empathy: Friday night? 8 p.m.? How long does it take to get a stir-fry in thebin? Not long at all, say several girlfriends I ask. Especially if a guy likeSpencer drops by.But not all the time are the psychopath’s motives so benign. They don’t justturn up on your doorstep to take you out for dinner. Sometimes, as GreaterManchester police discovered several years back, it’s to take you to thecleaners.INTO THE LION’S DENIn July 2007, local police were called to a house in Manchester. There’d been adisturbance at the address and a neighbour had picked up the phone. What theyfound when they got there shocked even the most experienced officers – those whothought they’d seen it all before. They hadn’t. A woman in her 30s had beenbludgeoned to death with a hammer, as had her daughter – aged 18 – and her13-year-old son. There was blood, together with an assortment of other bodilyfluids, everywhere. In no time at all the murders were front page news.That night, on television, detectives took a gamble. A name had emerged ofsomeone they wanted to talk to – and they decided to release it. He was theirman all right, no doubt about it; and given the ferocity of the attacks, and theunprecedented danger that the killer posed to the public, they thought it thesafest option to out him. The protocol of anonymity was one thing. Innocentpeople’s lives were another. They just couldn’t take the chance.‘We’re looking for Pierre Williams,’ said Detective Superintendent Paul Savillof Greater Manchester Police. ‘If you know where he is, do not, under anycircumstances, approach him. He’s violent and highly dangerous. And quitepossibly armed. If you have any information as to his whereabouts, contact thepolice immediately.’A few hours later, Savill received a phone-call.‘Hi,’ said a voice, calmly and matter-of-factly. ‘This is Pierre Williams. I’veseen on TV that I’m wanted for a triple murder. I’m coming in.’Savill wasn’t amused.‘If this is some kind of wind-up,’ he said, ‘I’m not in the mood.’It wasn’t.A short time later, Williams duly appeared. And Savill started to panic.The problem was one of time. Or, more specifically, lack of it. Savill knew, as,of course, did Williams, that from the moment a suspect is taken in forquestioning, the police have 96 hours to get their act together and presscharges. If, by that time, their enquiries are inconclusive – no hard evidencehas come to light – the suspect is free to go. And go, quite possibly, for good.This was a major headache. The doors of the incident room had barely evenopened. And yet here, cool as a cucumber, was the number one suspect strollingright through them. It wasn’t so much that the police had nothing to go on. Theyhadn’t even started looking. It was, on Williams’ part, a breathtakingly riskyplay.Williams, needless to say, wasn’t what you might call cooperative. Well awarethat the trail was starting cold, he refused, as was his right, to answer anyquestions. Not only that, but he’d appeared on police radar before: as thecleanup man for a well-known Manchester gang – covering tracks and getting ridof forensics. This, Savill realised, added to their problems big time. With hisprevious history of disposing of criminal evidence, Williams, it didn’t take agenius to work out, would of course have covered his own tracks meticulously.Which, to use the official terminology, was a king-sized pain in the arse.Eventually, as it turned out, Savill did get his man. A latent footprint –invisible to the naked eye – at the scene of the murders in Manchester proved apositive match with a footprint at Williams’ apartment. In Birmingham, 100 milesaway. The judge sent him down for life.But it was a close-run thing. Just three hours remained on the clock when newsof the breakthrough arrived.Savill breathed a massive sigh of relief.‘Williams coming forward immediately of his own volition was totallyunexpected,’ he admitted later. ‘No one could have predicted that. Right fromthe start he had us on the back foot. But none of us would’ve forgiven ourselvesif we’d let him slip through the net. We knew he was our man and it waspersistence and good old-fashioned police work that finally won the day. Butthere’s no doubt about it – we went right down to the wire on that one.’Even with a squad member down (it was in the police’s interest to detain theirman not release him), SPICE is a force to be reckoned with. Through theaudacious deployment of the four remaining factors – simplicity, incongruity,confidence and empathy – Williams, quite literally, almost got away with murder.MIND THE CRAPWhen Hannibal escapes in Silence of the Lambs, Starling is convinced he won’tcome after her. ‘To him,’ she surmises, ‘that would be rude.’ And she’s right.But not all psychopaths are as accommodating as Lecter. Their facility forflouting social norms, for doing the unexpected, can, as we’ve just seen withPierre Williams, often be electrifying. And significantly enhances theircapacity to charm and persuade.In his book The Stuff of Thought, the Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker talksabout implicatures. An implicature is a linguistic device that allows us to saywhat we mean by saying stuff that we … well, don’t mean.A classic example is often heard at the dinner table. Imagine that you’resitting down with a group of strangers and want someone to pass you the salt andpepper. You turn to the person next to you and say … what, exactly? Well, thechances are you won’t ask them to pass the salt and pepper. You won’t say whatyou mean. What you’ll probably say instead is something along the lines of:‘Would you mind passing the salt and pepper?’ or ‘Can you see the salt andpepper anywhere?’ Anything, in other words, but a short, sharp, simple andstraightforward ‘Pass the salt and pepper!’Implicatures exist, Pinker argues, because they enable us to save face. Theyinoculate against effrontery. The request ‘Pass the salt and pepper’ could, onthe one hand, be interpreted as a directive. Less of a request, and more of abarefaced challenge. On the other hand, however, ‘Can you see the salt andpepper anywhere?’ lets us off the hook. We all know what it means (JUST GIVE METHE BLOODY SALT AND PEPPER!) but somehow – because intention is implied ratherthan asserted – it doesn’t seem as bad.When I heard about implicatures I went over to Harvard to have a chat withPinker. Split-second persuasion, it seemed, didn’t fit the bill. Or so I thoughtat the outset.Take the following, for instance.A husband and wife are involved in a shouting match in their local bar. It’s theAugust bank holiday, and both of them are pissed. The pub is full of regulars,and the argument has been raging on for a good quarter of an hour.‘You never tell me the truth!’ yells the husband. ‘That’s always been theproblem with you. You’re never honest with me. Why don’t you just stop all thebullshit and give it to me straight?’‘Yeah,’ says the barman. ‘Why don’t you just drop the bullshit and tell theshort, fat, bald, stingy twat the truth from now on?’See what I mean? Statements like these aren’t exactly teeming with lines to readbetween, are they? They don’t leave too much to the imagination.But Pinker viewed it differently.We’ve basically developed all these linguistic strategies to protect ourselves,and they work. But they’re also a pain. So when somebody decides to break therules and just say it as it is – to cut through all the crap – it can, dependingon the context, be kind of refreshing. It can be a relief. It’s the basis of alot of humour, for example. And because our notions of politeness are shared – Iknow that you know that I know you’re breaking the rules – there’s still a kindof safety net there … It seems to me that the power of split-second persuasionlies in its freshness. It’s basically a cutting-through-the-crap kind ofinfluence …I liked where Pinker was coming from. Ironically, he seemed to be saying, it’sprecisely because we have implicatures that SPICE can work its magic. Becauseit’s less of the same. We’re all so busy going around trying not to offend eachother that when someone comes along and raises the finger to linguisticconvention our brains breathe a sigh of relief.Suddenly my thoughts turned to psychopaths.Little wonder they were the kings of persuasion. Irrespective of what Starlingmight have thought of Hannibal (and, let’s face it, he wasn’t that polite), thiswas exactly what they were good at. Their hardwired impulsivity and electrifyingcharisma made the use of incongruity second nature. Not only that, but they weregood at something else. Something directly related to what Pinker was sayingabout SPICE.When the chips are down and they stand to gain out of a situation, psychopathszero in. They’re second to none at ‘taking care of business’. At focusing onends rather than means. Or, as you may choose to say if you’re one of theworld’s greatest linguists, ‘cutting through the crap’.JUST REWARDImagine that I were to present you with a set of 64 cards, displayed one afterthe other on a computer screen, each bearing a two-digit number between one and99. There are eight of these two-digit numbers – and each will appear a total ofeight different times during the course of the presentation. Your task issimple.You must decide which of these numbers to respond to by pressing the X key onthe keyboard, and which of them to respond to by pressing Y.The only catch is that each time you get it wrong you’ll receive a painfulelectric shock.How do you think you’d get on?15 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c07-ftn15]A few years ago, thepsychologist Adrian Raine and his colleagues at the University of SouthernCalifornia in Los Angeles performed an experiment to find out. What they turnedup was astonishing.If you’re like most people, you’ll pick up the ‘rule’ pretty quickly (e.g. X =odd numbers; Y = even numbers). Once you’ve had one jolt, you won’t want anotherin a hurry.Except, that is, if you’re a psychopath. With these guys, something rather oddhappens.On tasks such as these – called passive avoidance learning tasks – psychopaths,time and again, commit significantly more errors than the rest of us. The threatof impending punishment, the prospect of danger or discomfort, just doesn’t seemto bother them in the same way it would you or me.They just couldn’t, it would seem, care less.Findings such as these may seem to indicate that psychopaths, on the face of it,just ‘aren’t interested’. That their singular lack of emotion quite simply‘tunes them out’. And this, on the face of it, sounds reasonable enough.But now let’s imagine a slightly different scenario. This time, let’s imaginethat we have exactly the same deal – the cards, the numbers, the shocks – but onthis occasion, should you get it right, you don’t just avoid the punishment, youalso get a reward: $5 a hit.Reckon that would make any difference? That you’d figure out the rule evenquicker? Most people reckon no. The electrodes do just fine. But in situationslike these, fortunes change dramatically.Psychopaths, as if by magic, actually perform better than the rest of us.In contrast to those scenarios in which the emphasis is on avoidance of thenegative, when there is actually something to gain from the enterprise they pickup the rule a lot faster. Appeal to a psychopath’s self-interest – and nothingmuch gets in the way.HOW TO WIN FRIENDS – AND LOCK THEM UPThe ability of the psychopath to flatline under pressure, to deliver the goodswhen the rest of us may drop them and run, has not been lost on the moviebusiness.The Dirty Dozen – set in World War II – features a band of 12 desperados on ado-or-die mission to destroy a French château full of high-ranking Germanofficers. Ultimately, the mission proves successful – although only one of the12 survives. But beneath this saga of redemption lies an interesting question:Why was this band of renegades picked for the job in the first place? Whyentrust a mission of such paramount strategic importance to a cohort of rapistsand murderers? Might the Hollywood dream factory have actually been tapping intosomething a little more ‘real’ here? Might the eagle have had a better chance oflanding if the roughnecks were calling it in? There’s evidence to suggest thatit might.In Britain, the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross is bestowed upon its recipients ‘inrecognition of an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operationsagainst the enemy’. Since its introduction in 1993 it’s been awarded on a mere37 occasions. Here’s an extract describing one such occasion taken from theIndependent:It was during fierce fighting in the caves of Tora Bora, a Taliban stronghold,as part of the hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2001 that SAS Regimental SergeantMajor Bob Jones [his name has been changed] took on the enemy armed only withhis commando knife, despite having been seriously wounded. He was hit at leasttwice by enemy fire, yet he somehow managed to get back to his feet and continuefighting, before resorting to his knife as the conflict descended into savagehand-to-hand contact … Officials described his ‘outstanding leadership indrawing his knife and charging the enemy, inspiring those around him whenammunition was running low and the outcome of the battle was in doubt.’4One sees similar focus among the world’s top con artists. Greg Morant, by hisown admission, prepares like an ‘Olympic athlete’ when there’s something big inthe offing.I’ll find out everything I can [about the person]. From how they do business towhat they do on the weekend. Top athletes study videos of their opponents,dissect their game. I do the same: gather information, start building up apicture of who I’m dealing with. It’s not rocket science. The more you knowabout someone, the more the odds are stacked in your favour …I’m like a surveyor. But instead of buildings I do minds. I go round and roundwith a fine-toothed comb. Looking for doors, for that secret way in. And youfind it eventually. There’s always a way in. Round the back. Out of sight. Hell,sometimes you just walk straight in through the front!It’s what everyone should do if they’re serious about getting ahead. I don’tmean to sound disrespectful, but all these books you read about how to persuadeand influence people? Most of them are full of shit. You can talk all you wantabout psychology. But the trick is to do your homework. To start a fire you’vegot to have something to burn. And not everything burns, right?If the psychopath can ‘make’ out of a situation, if there’s any kind of rewardon offer, they go for it. And go for it big time – irrespective of risk orpossible negative consequences. Not only do they keep their composure in thepresence of threat or adversity, they actually go one better. They become, inthe shadow of such presentiment, laser-like in their ability to ‘do whatever ittakes’.An example of such focus – in conjunction with the use of SPICE – comes from afriend of mine. Paul and I were at university together. Though he had little incommon with Hannibal Lecter (during the entire time I knew him he just aboutmanaged a parking ticket), Paul was, is, a psychopath. I know because I testedhim. But also, of course, there were the usual telltale signs. Suave,intelligent, ruthless and confident – the most striking thing about Paul, thecharacteristic that everyone knew him for, was his devastating ability topersuade. His ability to engender trust. It was, quite literally, as if he hadsome secret piece of software buried deep within his brain that enabled him tohack into the innermost thought-patterns of others. And then, once he had gainedaccess, to do anything he wanted. If Paul didn’t know your emotional passwordalready, it would take him less than five minutes to decipher it. He was (and nodoubt still is) one of the most gifted psycho-cryptographers I’ve ever known.The last time I saw Paul was around seven years ago, and he’d lost none of hisability to turn a situation to his advantage. Picture the scene: a crowded traincarriage in London, two builders covered in dirt and paint, and Paul in a neatlypressed pinstripe suit sitting opposite them. It’s been raining most of the dayand the builders – who’ve obviously been working outside – are wet through. Theystart to give Paul a hard time.Builder No. 1: You’ve got an easy number, haven’t you? Sitting there in yoursuit and tie. A real day’s work would kill you.Paul: Whose job would you rather have – yours or mine?Builder No. 1: You’re having a laugh, aren’t you? I wouldn’t be you for asecond!Paul: Fine. Then what are you complaining about?Builder No. 2: Clever bastard, eh? Well, let me tell you this. If he doesn’twant it, I’ll have it!Paul: Fine. Then what are you complaining about? You’re just jealous.One of Paul’s girlfriends (he had many) once told me a story that epitomises hisimprovisational genius. One night, as they lay in bed, they were awoken in thesmall hours by a burglar. It was dark, but Paul could just about make out theprofile of the intruder – barely a couple of metres away – hovering over hisPowerbook on the dresser. Whereas most people would pretend to be asleep – or,in blind panic, do something they’d later regret – Paul remained calm andfocused.‘Look,’ he said through the darkness, in an even, matter-of-fact tone, ‘I don’twant to get into a fight with you or anything – even if it means having to putdown this semiautomatic I’ve got trained on you under the duvet! I’ve brokeninto a few houses myself in my time [this was a lie] and I firmly believe thatwhat goes around comes around. So I suppose, when it comes down to it, I’mreally not that bothered if you take the Powerbook.‘In fact, I’ll cut you a deal. If you just let me copy a couple of things offthe desktop, I won’t even report it missing. For a start I can’t see your face.And if you’re smart you’ll have gloves on anyway. So at the end of the daythere’s no real point in me going to the police, is there? How about it?’Frozen in terror, Paul’s girlfriend lay beside him as the intruder, silhouettedagainst a nightlight on the landing, thought about his offer. Amazingly, afterwhat seemed like a lifetime, he decided to go for it: Paul’s magic had workedagain. But this was just the beginning. Having taken control of the situation,Paul really got down to business.First, he suggested to the burglar that he take a step outside for a momentwhile he began downloading. The light from the computer screen might illuminatehis face – and it would only prey on the burglar’s mind if he allowed himself tobe identified. He did as he was told. Next, as he sat at the dresser hooveringup his desktop, Paul began to chat to him. He started to make up details of thehouses he’d broken into, and of how the abuse he’d suffered from his stepfatherwhen he was a child had driven him to crime. (In fact, Paul had had a very happyupbringing.) Lo and behold, the intruder began to talk about his own traumaticchildhood, and the two of them struck up a conversation. They started to getalong.When Paul had finished downloading, he cut the intruder a second deal. Whydidn’t they continue the conversation downstairs in the kitchen over a beer?Though the circumstances were, to say the least, unusual, Paul felt that fatehad brought them together. They seemed to have a lot in common. And besides, hewas having trouble sleeping anyway. Again, the intruder swallowed it. As anafterthought (the burglar didn’t actually ask him to do this – this was justPaul getting into his stride), he threw a balaclava out through the bedroom doorand told him to put it on. That way he wouldn’t be recognised. Then the two ofthem went downstairs.Sure enough, as she hovered on the landing with a bath towel draped around her,Paul’s girlfriend heard the sound of the fridge door opening and two ring pullsbeing popped down below. Then, a little while later, two more. Eventually,despite Paul’s protestations, the burglar even took off his balaclava. He’dbegun to feel at home.The pair of them chatted for well over an hour. If you’d just been passing anddidn’t know who they were, you’d have bet your bottom dollar they’d known eachother years. When, finally, the burglar called it a night, a dozen or so canslay crumpled up on the table and the first signs of light were creeping inthrough the curtains.But before he went, Paul had an idea. Maybe the two of them should team uptogether. Being a postman (he was, in fact, in finance), he had insiderknowledge of when people in the area were going away on holiday. Intelligencelike that was priceless, he pointed out. Scarcely able to believe it, theburglar gave Paul his address and telephone number. They shook hands. Paul saidthat he’d call round in a day or two to talk business. And the burglar said‘Great!’ – he’d get some more beers in.Paul also insisted that the burglar – despite the fact he no longer wanted it –still take the Powerbook. ‘A deal’s a deal,’ he said.Next day, of course, the burglar did receive a visit. But it wasn’t from Paul.Several members of the local police managed to retrieve not only his Powerbookbut a whole load of other items that had been reported missing over the previousfew months.Paul got a personal letter of thanks from the superintendent, plus acommendation.Simplicity. Perceived self-interest. Incongruity. Confidence. Empathy. The darkpersuasive wizardry of the psychopath.SUMMARYWithin society, there have always been elites. There’s an elite in sport, inintelligence, and in social class. But there’s evidence to suggest that thereare also elite persuaders. And that quite a few of them are psychopaths.Most people think of psychopaths as monsters. As rapists, serial killers orterrorists. And they’re right. Many rapists, serial killers and terrorists arepsychopaths. Yet, contrary to popular belief, a great many psychopaths don’teven break the law. Instead, they head up multinational corporations, conducthigh-wire brain surgery, storm embassies and aeroplanes in balaclavas andrespirators. And invest our money in lucrative – if volatile – markets.This coolness under pressure, this superior neural air-con, equips thepsychopath perfectly for persuasion. A dysfunctional amygdala – the part of thebrain that processes and experiences emotion – and the attendant absence of fearthat almost invariably accompanies it, allows those who exhibit such anomaliesto take chances. To zone in on outcomes unimpeded by convention. To go for shotsthat to the rest of us seem unthinkable.When you’re as cold as ice and have the confidence to match, a hole in one isalways on the cards.In our final chapter, we continue our exploration of the frontiers of influence– moving from the ultimate persuader to the ultimate in persuasion.Flipnotists like Paul may well be the best in the business at decoding ourbrains’ security systems. But are there some combinations that even they can’tcrack?Does every lock of influence have its key?Or does persuasion – even SPICE – have its limits?1 The incidence of psychopathic disorder in the male population is estimated tobe around 1–3 per cent. In females, it’s around 0.5–1 per cent.*Answers: top, uneasy; middle, decisive; bottom, despondent.2 The exact number of women Bundy killed is not known. He confessed to 30murders during the period 1974–8, but estimates generally put the figure atcloser to 35.3 The actor Anthony Hopkins (allegedly) tells an amusing story about his ‘alterego’ Hannibal Lecter. Shortly after the release of Silence Of The Lambs,Hopkins, on a visit to Wales, sneaked into the back of a small provincial cinemawhere the film was being shown. During the climax of the movie, where Hannibalescapes and the empty, blood-spattered elevator comes into shot, Hopkins, rathernoisily, opened a bag of crisps. Pissed off – and rightly so – a woman sittingin front of him turned around. Five minutes later they were carting her out on astretcher.4 1 October, 2006. This is not in any way to imply that ‘Bob Jones’ is apsychopath or in any way an ‘undesirable’ – so don’t come after me, Bob! Thepoint I am making here is simply that there are certain psychopathic traits, inthis case focus and immediate disregard for one’s own personal wellbeing, thatcan, under the right circumstances, predispose one to greatness."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8HORIZONS OF INFLUENCEA man is walking through the streets of Belfast one night when he feels a gunagainst his head.‘Protestant or Catholic?’ says a voice.Thinking quickly, the man replies, ‘Jew.’‘Then I must be the luckiest Arab in Ireland,’ says the voice.At the height of the Second World War, a disguised Winston Churchill is on hisway to a secret underground location to broadcast a speech to the nation.

L. Mencken, the American humorist, once said that for every problem there isa solution which is simple, clean and wrong. But consider, for a moment, theflipside of such a statement: that for every problem there is indeed a solution,but one that’s simple, clean and right. That there exists, in some otherPlatonic zip code – uncontaminated by ego or misunderstanding – a master key topersuasion in perfect, pristine form. How feasible is such a notion – that anymind, at any time, really can be changed? If it is true, what kind of key mightit be? And how do we go about finding it?Several years ago, when I first started thinking about this problem, I rang upBob Cialdini. Cialdini, whom we’ve met a number of times already in this book,is Professor of Psychology and Marketing at Arizona State University, and one ofthe world’s leading experts on persuasion. I put it to him that persuasion, intheory at least, has no limits. He agreed.‘When you look at what happened in Jonestown,’ he responded, ‘how the ReverendJim Jones managed to per – suade those 900 people to take their ownlives … you’re talking pretty extreme mind control there. Maybe over the shortterm persuasion has its limits, but over the long term … I’m not so sure.’For quite some time after talking to Bob Cialdini I was pretty convinced he wasright. I was, in fact, prepared to go one step further. The examples ofextraordinary turnarounds that my own research had uncovered appeared, as we’veseen, to allude to something deeper. That even over the short term the power ofpersuasion was infinite. That the solutions were out there – it was just amatter of finding them.But then something happened that completely changed all that. I came face toface with the Mirror Man.1 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn1]I first ran into the Mirror Manin the spring of 2008. Max Coltheart, Professor of Psychology at MacquarieUniversity, had mentioned him at a conference. I was intrigued. I emailedColtheart several days later and asked if I could visit. Fine, he said, justdon’t expect any miracles. I won’t, I lied. And hopped on a plane to Australia.The Mirror Man is one of the strangest case studies ever to emerge from theannals of neuropsychology. (And there have certainly been some strange ones overthe years.) The encounter took place in Sydney, at the University of Macquarie’sCentre for Cognitive Science, where Coltheart has founded the Belief FormationProgramme: a project designed to unravel the causes of delusional ideation anddevelop a model of belief acquisition and rejection.He’s certainly not short on raw material.Up until now, the programme has hosted a bewildering array of notionalmalapropisms ranging from the more common type of delusions usually found inschizophrenia (delusions of persecution – people are out to get you; delusionsof reference – private conversation and background social ‘noise’ is targetedspecifically at you; and delusions of control – alien forces are controlling, orintercepting, your thought patterns) to an even more bizarre category ofcognitive misapprehension: monothematic delusions.Included in this latter taxonomy is the Capgras delusion (the belief thatsomeone emotionally close to you – most typically your partner – is not who theyappear to be but, rather, an identical-looking impostor); the Cotard delusion(the belief that you are dead); and the Fregoli delusion (the belief that youare being stalked by a group of people who are disguising themselves to concealtheir true identities).Then there’s the daddy of them all: the mirrored-self misidentificationdelusion.The Mirror Man, whom I’ll call George, is in his mid-80s. He’s friendly, marriedwith two children, and, after a successful career in business, still keeps hishand in running an advertising firm with his wife. God, I think to myself, whenI see him. This guy is just so normal. Can it really be true – all these thingsI’ve heard about him? I soon find out that it is.One of Coltheart’s co-researchers, Nora Breen, presses the button on a TV remoteand we enter a room with a mirror. George stands in front of the mirror and Noraasks him: ‘Who do you see in the mirror, George?’George sounds apprehensive.‘It’s him,’ he says.‘Who?’ asks Nora.‘Him,’ says George. ‘The guy who follows me around. The guy who dresses like me.And looks like me. And does everything at exactly the same time as me.’Nora shuffles into the picture.‘Who do you see now?’ she asks.‘That’s you,’ says George. ‘And him.’I’m gobsmacked.Ask him to explain how you’re standing next to him in front of the mirror, Iwill her, and yet the guy who’s staring back is someone else entirely.She does.George shakes his head.‘Look,’ he says. ‘I know it sounds crazy but that’s just the way it is. I wish Icould believe it was me in there. But I can’t. It’s some other guy. He lookslike me. Acts like me. Does everything at exactly the same time as me. But it’sjust not me! It’s him.’‘Thanks, Nora,’ I say, and pour myself some coffee.We decide to leave it there.CRISIS OF CONVICTIONMy encounter with the Mirror Man gave me quite a bit to think about. What I’dwitnessed in Max Coltheart’s lab wasn’t just George having a bad day. It wasGeorge having a good day. He was, in fact, quite a star at the Belief FormationProgramme. Staff there had tried pretty much everything to help him but had,quite clearly, run into a brick wall. George’s conviction that the man in themirror was an impostor – and not himself – remained as rock-solid as ever. Andthings, Coltheart surmised, weren’t going to get any better. No matter what theythrew at him.Suddenly, my thoughts returned to Jonestown. There was, it occurred to me, awhopping great paradox here. On the one hand, the Reverend Jim Jones couldpersuade 900 people to guzzle away their lives – not just their own but those oftheir children, too – around a big sloshing tub of arsenic-laced Koolaid. On theother, some of the world’s top psychologists were having trouble with a man anda mirror: convincing him that it really was him in the reflection, and not – ashe insisted – some dastardly, double-dealing alterego.The implications were intriguing. Either there was something a little bitspecial about people like Jones, and we needed to find some in Sydney. Or therewas something going on with the anatomy of belief itself. Some spectrum ofstrength along which all conviction lies. Unshakeable at one end, ephemeral atthe other; with a sliding scale of influence, of openness to persuasion, inbetween.YES, WE CAN2 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn2]In the summer of 2008, not longbefore Barack Obama’s presidential nomination, Ray Friedman, Professor ofManagement at Vanderbilt University, and two co-researchers sampled 20 questionsfrom the verbal section of the Graduate Record Examination and cobbled them intoa test. They administered the test to two groups of Americans – AfricanAmericans on the one hand, Caucasians on the other – and averaged up the scoresfor each one. Several months later, when the election was done and dusted andObama had been sworn in, they gave out again. To exactly the same groups. Andtotted up the averages like before.What Friedman and his co-workers were hoping to find was the opposite of whattheir predecessors had found a decade or so earlier. 3[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn3]Back in the nineties, groups ofstudents with identical SAT scores had taken a similar test at Stanford. There,researchers had discovered that African Americans performed significantly worseon the GRE-style problems when asked, at the outset, to tick a box thatindicated their ethnic background. The reason for the disparity was clear.Ticking the box had done more than provide demographics. It had, for the AfricanAmericans, activated the racial stereotype of academic inferiority. It had toldthem, No, you can’t.A generation on, and Friedman was after the leveller.‘Obama is obviously inspirational,’ he says. ‘But we wondered whether he wouldcontribute to an improvement in something as important as black test-taking.’Incredibly, it turned out he could.Analysis revealed that prior to Obama’s nomination, whites, on average, scoredaround 12 out of 20 on the questions – compared with around 8.5 for blacks. Butwhen the tests were administered subsequently – immediately after Obama’snomination acceptance speech, and then again, after his inauguration – it was adifferent story entirely. On both occasions, the performance of the AfricanAmericans improved significantly.The writing was on the wall. Nobody had suddenly gotten brighter here. We’retalking, after all, about only a matter of months. It was simply a case ofharnessing the power of conviction.Of believing that, yes, we can.TWO MINDSFriedman’s results have currently still to be replicated. And, in fairness, thebungee-like ease with which the performance gap contracted exceeded even his ownexpectations. But there’s evidence to suggest that he and his co-workers are onthe right track. And that Henry Ford might well have had a point: If you believeyou can, or believe you can’t – either way you’re right.Jeff Stone, a psychologist at the University of Arizona, has demonstratedeffects similar to Friedman’s in sport. In a study which pitted black againstwhite on the golf course (we touched upon this briefly in Chapter 3[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c03_r1.htm]), Stone has shown that when golf is framedas a test of athletic prowess, it’s the black players, on average, who post thebetter scorecards. But guess what? When the game is portrayed as a measure ofstrategic ability, and the athletic component swept quietly under the carpet,fortunes change. It’s the white guys who stake out the fairways – while theblack guys strike out in the rough.Then there’s Margaret Shih and her Asian women maths students. Asian women, ifyou recall, perform better at maths when they think of themselves as ‘Asian’(i.e. when the racial stereotype is activated) – and worse when the spotlightsuddenly switches to gender (i.e. when they think of themselves as ‘women’).And such observations have nothing to do with effort. It’s not that the womentry harder all of a sudden when magically, by decree of random selection, theyhappen to ‘turn Asian’. Far from it. Like Friedman’s students, and the hackerstested by Stone, they are, instead, persuaded to do better. Not, perhaps, in thetraditional sense of the word – through incentives, rewards, or the usualmethods of everyday social influence – but by spiking their brains withconfidence. By switching their mindsets from one component of endogenousself-identity, to another.4 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn4]Cognitive psychologist CarolDweck, at Stanford, has done some interesting work on mindsets. In support ofthe idea that some beliefs are harder to shift than others (and some individualsharder to persuade), Dweck has identified two different styles of thinking: waysof relating to the world that can, according to her research, ultimatelypredispose us to success or failure in life.Mindsets, according to Dweck, have one of two signs up in the window: open orclosed. Those with the closed sign Dweck calls ‘fixed’. This mindset, sheclaims, belongs to people who ‘do things their way’ – who are wary of exceedingtheir comfort zones, who see effort as negative, and who are averse to beingstretched. Those displaying the open sign, in contrast, Dweck refers to as‘growth’ mindsets. People with this kind of mindset tend generally to be moreflexible – more amenable to learning, and open to the prospect of challenge. Andprefer, unlike those with a fixed mindset, to assimilate the viewpoints ofothers.Dweck has shown that it’s possible to manipulate these mindsets. And, moreover,that each is accompanied by a distinct neural signature. In one study, studentswere split into two groups. One group were presented with arguments thatsupported a ‘fixed’ mindset (e.g. ‘Your intelligence is something very basicthat cannot change much’), while the other group were presented with argumentsin favour of a ‘growth’ mindset (e.g. ‘No matter how intelligent you are, youcan always improve’). Subsequently, both groups then completed a difficultreading comprehension task (on which they performed poorly) and were asked,after receiving feedback, whether they’d like to check out the answers of someof the other participants in the study: either those who’d performed better thanthem, or those who’d performed worse.Exactly as Dweck predicted, the fault-line ran right down the middle. Thestudents who were exposed to the fixed mindset literature went straight for theanswers of those who’d done worse: it boosted their self-esteem. On the otherhand, however, those presented with the growth mindset arguments gravitated theother way. They chose the tests of those who’d done better – compared themselvesupwards, in other words – to hoover up strategies that might help them out infuture.But that wasn’t all. Alongside this chasm of comparison a secondary fault-linematerialised – inside participants’ heads. In a follow-up experiment using EEG,Dweck monitored patterns of cortical brain activity as the students took part ina general knowledge quiz. The experiment consisted of two parts. The first partkicked in after participants provided their answers. Here, a second and a halfafter each response was entered, a program revealed whether the students had gotit right. Then, a second and a half after that, up popped the actual solution.The data mapped on to the behavioural findings perfectly.Exactly as the results of the previous study suggested, Dweck found thatstudents who presented with closed, or fixed-style mindsets entered, asexpected, a heightened state of vigilance during the initial phase of theexperiment (while they waited to see if they’d answered the questionscorrectly).But then their brains zoned out. They simply cut and ran.The students with the growth mindsets, on the other hand, exhibited a differentpattern entirely. Sure, during the first phase of the experiment – while theywaited for either the thumbs up or thumbs down – their brains, just like thoseof their fixed mindset counterparts, ‘switched on’. But then (in contrast totheir fixed mindset counterparts) instead of switching off once the cat was outof the bag, they continued to twitter – sustaining the activity right the waythrough the next second and a half, while they awaited confirmation of what theanswers actually were.Some of us, it seems, are genuinely open to influence. Others just want to be‘right’.JUST CAN’T HELP BELIEVING?The results of Carol Dweck’s research, and the work of Ray Friedman and JeffStone among others, gels rather nicely with a quantitative take on persuasion.It supports the observation that some people – extreme fundamentalists, forinstance – have a mindset so fixed, have neurons that fuse together so solidlyon impact, that they can, at times, be almost impossible to influence. And thatothers just go with the flow.Some of this may well be innate. Take a look inside any classroom or playgroundand you’ll see both sides of the coin: kids who are traumatised by even theslightest criticism or challenge, and 5[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn5]kids who take it all in theirstride. (Want to see how easily persuaded you are? Then why not take the test onthis page [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_bm1_r1.htm#page335]?) On the other hand, weall have our moments. Our islets of fanaticism on which only the in-crowd arewelcome. This suggests that environment is also important – shaping, over time,not only our attitudes in general but also, over the short term, dictating thosevalues most salient in our lives. (Relatives, for example, of those killed inIraq or Afghanistan are likely to have stronger views on British or US foreignpolicy than those, perhaps, with less personal involvement.)But it also hints at something a little deeper – a general, founding principleof how our brains make up our minds. If belief and emotion are so deeplyintertwined, could it be that our brains are somewhat less discerning than wethink? That they leap before they look? That first they believe and thenappraise and consider? And that the views we espouse are not the views thatwe’ve reasoned ourselves towards – but instead are the views we’ve been unableto reason away from?Though such a notion seems crazy, there’s evidence to suggest that it’s true.1And that the feeling we get when we’re served up new information – of chewing itover and deciding, morsel by morsel, whether or not to swallow it – is actuallyan illusion.6 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn6]Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbertand his colleagues conducted a study in which participants were told about arobbery. Volunteers were divided into two groups. One group read statementswhich exacerbated the severity of the crime (e.g. ‘Kevin threatened to sexuallyassault the clerk’), while the other group read the opposite: statements thatextenuated the felony (e.g. ‘Tom apologised to the clerk for having to rob thestore’).Somewhat unusually for a psychology experiment, the researchers came clean fromthe start. Right off the bat, both groups were told that the characterdescriptions were bogus. Yet while the participants were reading about therobbers, some of them were interrupted: the researchers assigned them a countingtask to perform. Such distraction, Gilbert proposed (if first we believe andthen ‘unbelieve’), should interfere with the ‘unbelieving’ part of the equation.It should, in those crucial few milliseconds during which the brain, havingtaken in information and ‘believed’ it, decides whether or not to continuebelieving it, divert its attention to a completely different task: much like the‘removals men’ in Chapter 3 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c03_r1.htm] diverted theattention of the hotel receptionist at the wedding – and then carted off thepresents. And should, even though the participants were told quite clearly thatthe character references were false, in fact make them think they were true.This, it turned out, is exactly what happened. When, at the conclusion of thestudy, the participants were asked to pass sentence on the robbers, someinteresting verdicts came in.Mr Nice, on average, got 5.8 years; Mr Nasty, 11.2.2And this, remember, was in spite of the fact that the participants – right fromthe word go – had been told quite clearly that the character descriptions werefalse.Sometimes you can’t unbelieve everything you read.BELIEF IMMUNODEFICIENCYThe implications of Gilbert’s study definitely take some getting used to. On theother hand, however, certain things fall into place. We can see, all of asudden, why empathy and perceived self-interest are so important in persuasion.If, by using the right combination of words, by invoking the right linguisticforce field, we can frame something in such a way that makes whoever we’retalking to want to believe it, then we’re halfway there already. Because rightfrom the gun, they actually believe it anyway: at least, that is, for the firstfew hundred milliseconds! Our job as persuader is easier than we think. It’s notto get others believing what we say. It’s to stop them unbelieving.Then, of course, there’s the role of incongruity. Recall, from Chapter 6[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c06_r1.htm], how customers were more likely to purchaseChristmas cards from a door-to-door salesman if he unexpectedly quoted the pricein cents rather than dollars? And how visitors to an outdoor market bought morecupcakes from a confectioner if he referred to them as ‘half-cakes’? There was,if you remember, a catch. The scam only worked if the vendor, immediately afterhis unusual opening gambit, slipped in a caveat: in the case of the Christmascards, ‘It’s a bargain!’ and in the case of the cupcakes, ‘They’re delicious!’It doesn’t take a genius to work out what’s going on here. It’s simple: the‘Gilbert effect’ in reverse. Customers are offered the standard one-line salespatter – ‘It’s a bargain!’ or ‘They’re delicious!’ – but are so bamboozled bythe nonsense that’s just preceded it that they ‘forget to unbelieve’. They areso preoccupied with getting their heads around half-cakes, orhowever-many-thousand cents they have to fork out for the Christmas cards, thattheir brains’ central locking systems conveniently fail to activate – and thedoors are left wide open.The conclusion seems pretty clear. Shut down production of the brain’s unbeliefantibodies – for sufficient length of time as to enable whatever virus ofinformation we wish to introduce to multiply and gain a toehold – and thenpersuasion should have no limits. The problem, of course, lies in knocking outthe system.PERSUASION UNDER PRESSUREI got my own, very personal taste of the belief immunodeficiency virus whiledoing a pilot for a TV show about persuasion. The episode centred on persuasionin a military setting. What, I wanted to know, were the characteristics of agood interrogator? Could any of us do it? Or was there, like everything, aspectrum of natural talent? Iconic images of interrogators in popular culture –Laurence Olivier in Marathon Man, for instance – suggest that it’s badnessrather than brilliance that tips the balance, that separates the men from theboys. Yet research conducted in both military and forensic settings sheds aradically different light on the subject. Rather than resorting to violence, theworld’s most sophisticated interrogators have much in common with the world’smost sophisticated con artists. They infiltrate rather than invade. Work ourminds rather than our molars. And possess an intuitive grasp of primaeval‘street psychology’.To find out what my own limits were, some bright spark had the idea of pittingme against the professionals: Ivy League expert on persuasion trades the lawnsand libraries of Cambridge University for a head-to-head with Special Forcesmind-hacks. I was to be given three pieces of information which I was toendeavour to conceal from my ‘captors’ – who, in turn, would deploy a lethalcombination of physical and psychological techniques to try to get them out ofme.It seemed like a good idea – until I met one of the interrogators.‘What level of violence should I expect?’ I asked Dave, as we sat sipping lattesin Starbucks.He smiled.‘It’s not the violence that’ll break you,’ he told me. ‘It’s the threat ofviolence. That carcinogenic thought process that something terrible is going tohappen and that it’s just around the corner.’‘Are you sure you should be telling me that?’ I joked.‘It makes no difference at all,’ he replied. ‘Even though you know in advancethat we’re not going to kill you, it won’t be of any use. It’s what’s in here[he tapped his head] that’s going to finish you. Sure, you might believe rightnow that we’re not going to kill you. But once we get rolling, it won’t takemuch for the boys to convince you otherwise.’To be honest, I was sceptical. But then Dave gave me an example of the kind ofthing that happens in Special Forces selection – the kind of thing he had instore for me.Typically by this stage the candidate’s exhausted … Then the last thing he seesbefore we place the hood over his head is the two-tonne truck. We lie him downon the ground, and as he lies there he hears the sound of the truck gettingcloser and closer. After thirty seconds or so, it’s right there on top of him –the engine just inches away from his ear. We give it a good rev and then thedriver jumps out. He slams the door and walks away. The engine’s still running.A little while later, from somewhere in the distance, someone asks if thehandbrake’s on. At this point, one of the team – who unbeknown to the guy in thehood has been there all the time – gently starts to roll a spare tyre on to histemple as he lies on the ground. You know, by hand. Gradually, he increases thepressure. Another member of the team revs the truck up a bit so it seems like itmight be moving. After a few seconds of that, we take the tyre away and removethe hood. Then we lay into him.‘Tell us your fucking name …’ It’s not unusual for people to throw in the towelat that point.When it came to it, my ‘moment of truth’ wasn’t entirely dissimilar. Chainednaked to the floor of a shadowy, disused warehouse, I watched – seemingly inslow motion – as a huge forklift truck dangled a pallet of reinforced concreteten or so metres above my head, and then gradually lowered it so that the rough,splintery base exerted a gentle pressure on my chest. It remained there forabout 15 seconds before I heard the operator yell above the scream of thehydraulics: ‘Jim, the mechanism’s jammed. I can’t get it to move …’Dave was right. In hindsight, in the safety of the debriefing room, it soonbecame clear that I’d been in no physical danger whatsoever. In actual fact, the‘reinforced concrete’ hadn’t been concrete at all – but mocked-up foam. And themechanism hadn’t jammed. It was perfectly OK. But, of course, I hadn’t knownthat at the time. And neither do the Special Forces candidates who undergo suchtreatment in selection. From where I was standing (or lying) on thepuddle-strewn, diesel-stained floor of some derelict depot in the middle of whatcould have been anywhere (I’d been taken there hooded to add to my sense ofdisorientation), it had all been terrifyingly real. Despite what Dave had saidabout not killing me, when a ten-tonne weight is hovering so close you can smellit, and is making it just that little bit more difficult for you to breathe,it’s hard to ‘unbelieve’ that you’re about to meet your Maker. Close toimpossible, in fact. Your brain’s so busy running its fear program, itcompletely overrides its ‘lie detection’ module.Unbelief is the friction that keeps persuasion in check. Without it, there’d beno limits.WHEN THE END OF THE WORLD IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLDOne of the funny things about unbelief is that sometimes the brain can unbelieveitself. Sometimes, when we’re really not sure that we like something, or areunhappy with a particular outcome, we convince ourselves it’s actually not sobad. And when that starts to happen, next station down is the Mirror Man.7 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn7]In 1956, the Stanford socialpsychologist Leon Festinger posed a question that all of us have probably askedourselves at one time or another: What happens to members of religious cultsthat prophesy the end of the world … and it doesn’t happen? Do they all go backto their day jobs and ‘put it down to experience’? Or what, exactly?To find out, Festinger infiltrated a UFO doomsday cult – led by Chicagohousewife Marion Keech – whose preternatural tip-off that the world, on themorning of 21 December, was to be destroyed by alien floodwaters, turned out tobe misguided. Not to be outprophesied, Festinger made a prediction of his own:contrary to what common sense might dictate under such circumstances, thegroup’s proselytising would – far from petering out after the prophecymalfunction – in contrast actually increase. The contradiction of the worldending on the one hand, and life carrying on as normal on the other, would,Festinger proposed, nag the brain into manufacturing a renewed, even stronger,commitment to the cause – so as to reduce the tension between subjective andobjective reality, and restore psychological harmony.This, it transpired, is precisely what happened. Exactly as Festinger foretold,Keech’s tip-off turned out not to have been misguided after all. Far from it.Rather, her followers came out fighting – with renewed vigour and tighter knitthan ever. The marauding aliens, as a gesture to the ‘true believers’, had, itmaterialised, had second thoughts. The world was to be granted a stay ofexecution and the entire population spared. It was either that, as Festingerpointed out, or face the unspeakable alternative. That there never had been acustom-built flying saucer. That the master plan to spirit them all off into thecosmos had never existed in the first place. And that the jobs, spouses andhouses had all been abandoned in vain.8 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn8]Festinger’s exposé of Keech’sdivinations precipitated an avalanche of research into the dynamics of cognitivedissonance. The flagship study, conducted by Festinger himself in 1959, did muchto get things moving. The study consisted of three key ingredients: theobligatory cohort of students, a series of meaningless and mind-numbinglytedious tasks, and a downright whopper of a lie: the students had to perform thetasks and then rope in subsequent ‘participants’ (in reality, associates of theresearchers) by claiming that they were actually interesting.The students were split into two groups. Members of one group were paid $1 fortheir duplicity, the others $20. What effect, Festinger wondered, would thedifference in recompense have on the students’ real ratings of the task?The answer, it turned out, was a huge one. Sure enough, just as dissonancetheory predicted (and totally counter to the laws of common sense) thosestudents who were given just $1 to mislead their fellow participants exhibitedfewer misgivings about the task than their better-paid counterparts.Incredible!And the reason?According to Festinger, it was simple. The $1 group experienced greaterdissonance than the $20 group – $1 as opposed to $20, providing insufficientjustification for their attitude-discrepant behaviour (telling a person that thetasks were really interesting when in actual fact they were boring). Thestudents, in the absence of any other justification for their behaviour, wereforced to internalise the attitude they were induced to express – and came, inso doing, genuinely to believe that the tasks they had performed were enjoyable.On the other hand, those in the $20 group had reason to believe there wasexternal justification for their behaviour – they were in it for the money. Noconfusion there over job satisfaction.WHY WE LOVE THE THINGS WE HATE (ESPECIALLY IF WE CAN’T GET A REFUND)The perils of cognitive dissonance should feature uppermost in the mind of anyprospective persuader. Especially in situations where there’s a lot at stake andthe person whom one is persuading has much to lose. Festinger’s study – thesedays considered a classic – provided, for the very first time, concrete evidenceof something that we now take for granted: powerful gravitational forces deepwithin our brains keep the orbits of both belief and behaviour in closepsychological alignment. But sometimes, quite evidently, the gravity is toosevere – the alignment, in some cases, so slavishly snug that reason disappearsinto a neural black hole. In advertising, for example, studies have shown thatit’s not just smokers’ arteries that harden as a result of their habit. So, too– in the wake of public health campaigns – do their attitudes.Consider the dilemma faced by a smoker on exposure to an anti-smoking ad. Thestatements ‘I smoke’ and ‘Smoking kills’ are never, for obvious reasons, goingto hit it off naturally. They are never going to blossom into the greatest ofcognitive room buddies. So either one of them leaves and finds a dorm elsewhere,or they learn to muddle through (the smoker typically focusing on the perceivedbenefits of their habit – e.g. ‘It helps me relax’; ‘All of my friends smoke’ –while at the same time downplaying the risks: ‘Not all experts agree’; ‘It onlyaffects older people’).The same is true of religious conviction. The cognitive thrift that typifiescertain believers (as well, of course, as certain non-believers) stems from thehuge psychological investment loans that such beliefs soak up – often over aperiod of many years, and often underwritten by those old established clearinghouses of self-identity (moral outlook, social networks, and politicalaffiliation). Could you sell up and start again from scratch?There are other, more mundane examples. Consider what happens when you buysomething in a store, have second thoughts about it when you get home – andthen, on taking it back, discover that the store employs a ‘no returns’ policy.If you’re like most people, what usually tends to happen is this: you magicallycome round to actually quite liking whatever it is that you bought. Hey, youthink, as you scrunch up the receipt and toss it into the bin, it’s not so badafter all. I guess.But there’s no magic at work here – rather, the hand of cognitive dissonance.Two incontrovertible and antithetical cognitions – ‘I have spent X amount onthis particular purchase’ on the one hand, and ‘I don’t like it and can’t changeit’ on the other – are forced to cohabit the same bit of brainspace until one oftwo things happens. They either get their act together and sort out theirdifferences. Or one of them packs its bags. Nine times out of ten, they learn toget along.THE NEUROLOGY OF INFLUENCEThe effects of cognitive dissonance demonstrate quite clearly how thepropositional aspects of belief are closely tied in with emotion. 9[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn9]But a recent experiment conductedby Sam Harris and his colleagues at the University of California in Los Angelesgoes one better – and shows how belief, emotion and influence are possibly tiedup in the brain.Using a special goggle display unit which participants wore over their eyes,Harris flashed statements from seven different subject categories at them whichthey rated for authenticity. Each of the seven categories (mathematical,geographical, autobiographical, religious, ethical, semantic and factual)contained three kinds of statement: statements that were true; statements thatwere false; and statements that were neither – those, in other words, thatcouldn’t be verified one way or the other. (For example, a true/mathematicalstatement might be (2 + 6) + 8 = 16; a false/ethical statement might be‘Children should have no rights until they vote’; and a religious/unverifiablestatement might be ‘Jesus spoke 2,467 words in the New Testament’.)As participants evaluated the statements, Harris turned detective, snoopingaround inside their brains using fMRI. Which anatomical regions, he wondered,corresponded to each of the different appraisals – to the belief, disbelief, anduncertainty that the three kinds of statement elicited?The results were intriguing. To begin with, reaction-time data revealed thatstatements were accepted as true faster than they were rejected as false –providing further support for Spinoza’s original conjecture that first webelieve, and then ‘unbelieve’.But there was more. Belief, Harris found, was accompanied by an increase inactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (see Figure 8.1a) – the part ofthe brain usually associated with integrating fact and feeling, and withmodulating behaviour in response to changing reward contingencies (weighing uppros and cons, in other words). Disbelief, in turn, activated the anteriorinsula (see Figure 8.1b) – the region often implicated in the coding of aversivereactions such as pain and disgust, and in assessing the pleasantness ofdifferent tastes and odours. Uncertainty, as predicted, nudged the anteriorcingulate cortex – a kind of neurological warning light that flashes on and offwhen something perplexingly novel suddenly appears on the radar (see Figures8.1c(i) and (ii)).Figure 8.1a (below) – Activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex regionsfor judgements of truth (belief), across the seven statement categories:mathematical, geographical, autobiographical, religious, ethical, semantic andfactual. Sections in white indicate areas of increased brain activity.

Sagittal image (right) shows increased activity inthe superior parietal lobe, the cingulate cortex and the superior frontal gyrus.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_052_r1.jpg]Below: Figures 8.1c (i – top) and 8.1c (ii – bottom) – Activation of theanterior cingulate and superior frontal gyrus during judgements of uncertainty.Fig 8.1c (i) shows the contrast with judgements of belief. Fig 8.1c(ii) showsthe contrast with disbelief.Could these be the regions that define the limits of influence? Might beliefsthat fire the emotions, that crucially give rise to a heightened level ofactivity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, be particularly hard to shift?While those that antagonise the prickly anterior insula are particularly hard toacquire? The hypothesis certainly seems plausible – though as Mark Cohen, one ofHarris’ co-authors, pointed out when I put it to him, it’s one thing looking atneural correlates in the lab and quite another, say, in the boardroom. Wherepeople are involved. And the propositional markers of ‘true’, ‘false’, and‘don’t know’ are considerably less sanitised.‘Persuasion is a social thing,’ he says. ‘And social inter – action introduces anumber of other brain circuits not specifically catered for in our study … Butwhat we can say is that belief, disbelief and uncertainty do seem to beassociated with discrete neural signatures of acceptance, rejection andindecision.’For SPICE, too, there are implications. A style of persuasion that engages,simultaneously, all three of the brain’s influence hotspots (incongruity – theanterior cingulate cortex; simplicity, perceived self-interest, confidence andempathy – the ventromedial prefrontal cortex; with the combination of all fiveelements disengaging, rather than engaging, the redundant anterior insula) isundoubtedly going to be powerful. Under some circumstances (one thinks, forinstance, of neonatal persuasion: crying pitch activating the anterior cingulatecortex, and kindchenschema networks in the prefrontal cortex) irresistible even.DRIVEN TO DISTRACTIONIn blazing 90-degree heat, on the banks of the Swan River, over a beer, Idiscuss Harris’ findings with Colin MacLeod, Professor of Clinical Psychology atthe University of Western Australia, in Perth. MacLeod is an expert in anxietydisorders, and knows only too well how belief and emotion can sink their teethinto each other. He is about to introduce me to Tania – a 27-year-old manicuristwith a seatbelt phobia, who works at a local beauty salon. Or rather did, untilshe was forced into selling her car.‘A lot of the time we worry about the worry,’ explains MacLeod. ‘We conflate thething we’re worrying about with the worry that the thing we’re worrying aboutgives rise to. This “second order” worry then takes over and things getconfused. The second order worry gradually becomes the focal point of theproblem – the first order worry, if you get my meaning …‘So ironically, what we’re going to be doing with Tania is getting her to focusher anxiety on the seatbelt, because in doing so what we’re actually doing,unbeknown to her, is taking her mind off the real source of her anxiety – theworry about the worry – and transplanting it on to a “ghost” anxiety: theoriginal hub that now lies emotionally dormant. Basically it’s distraction indisguise. What Tania will be unconsciously ‘concentrating away’ will not, infact, be the actual phobia itself – but a satellite anxiety associated with thephobia’s onset.’Catch the brain with its pants down, and anything is possible.As Tania arrives and we set off for the parking lot, MacLeod begins chatting toher. Putting her at ease.‘What I need to do first,’ he explains matter-of-factly, ‘is to see the symptomsfirst hand – for myself – in order to know what I can do about them. Is thatOK?’Tania nods.‘Good,’ says MacLeod. ‘So let’s do it in stages. First, tell me how you feelright now, as we approach the parking lot. Concentrate hard on those feelings ofanxiety and try and express them to me.’Tania goes quiet for a few seconds as she tries to sum up how she feels. Thenshe says, ‘Well, actually, I seem to be OK at the moment.’‘OK,’ says MacLeod. ‘That’s fine. We’ll try again in a minute.’Sure enough, as we reach her car, MacLeod asks Tania the same question. Focus onthat anxiety, he urges her, and tell me how it feels. Once again, Tania draws ablank. Amazingly, she draws another blank a few seconds later as she is gettinginto the car. And another as she puts on her seatbelt. Driving around theparking lot doesn’t seem to cause her any problems. And neither does the trafficon the freeway. Suddenly it appears that the appointment has been unnecessary.The symptoms a false alarm. And that the phobia – if, indeed, that’s what it is– has never really existed. Except, of course, that it has. And it’s recentlycost her her job.Back on the river, over another beer, I suggest to MacLeod that what he’s justused is SPICE. He doesn’t disagree – though the technical term, he points out,is actually paradoxical intention: the eradication of a particular symptom bymaking the symptom itself the sole focus of attention. This gets me thinking.Before my meeting with MacLeod, it hadn’t really occurred to me that therapy wasa form of persuasion. I guess because it’s ‘medical’ and you have to make anappointment. But MacLeod himself is under no such illusions.‘Therapy is absolutely about persuasion,’ he says. ‘Fundamentally, it’s aboutchanging people’s belief systems. And the bottom line is that therapists areprofessional persuaders. What CBT3– my own brand of therapy – does is it enacts a paradigm shift in people’sheads. It doesn’t come up with the solution to the problem but rather adifferent way of thinking about it. It isn’t so much about providing a key. Butwhat it does do is persuade the client to think about changing the lock.’BE HAPPY, DON’T WORRYOver the past few years, MacLeod has been at the forefront of a brand new formof therapy called Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) which, if it works (and theearly signs are good), could completely redefine the limits of persuasion. As apost-doc back in the early-eighties, MacLeod was among the first wave ofresearchers to bring the methods of cognitive psychology to the clinical table –specifically, to the area of anxiety disorder. What were anxious peoplethinking? MacLeod wanted to know. And how did it differ from what the rest of uswere thinking? What he came up with was profound. Just as, say, a ManchesterUnited fan will zone in on the words ‘Manchester United’ on a page of otherwiseirrelevant text, so the attention of anxious individuals is drawn, inexorably,to threatening things around them. Unlike the rest of us, who are able to screenthem out, anxious people can’t. They are, to use the technical term, ‘threatvigilant’.10 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn10]MacLeod has demonstrated thisusing a paradigm known as the dot probe task. Participants are divided into twogroups – anxious and non-anxious – and stare at a fixation cross at the centreof a computer screen. Two words, one of which is neutral and one of which isthreatening, are then presented randomly on either side of the screen (left orright) for around 500 milliseconds, before a probe (usually a dot) appears inone of these former locations. Participants must then indicate the location ofthis dot (left or right) as quickly as possible via a key press – beforerepeating the process over a series of subsequent trials.When, at the end of the procedure, reaction times are averaged and theperformance of the anxious and non-anxious groups is compared, a telltaledifference materialises. Anxious individuals, it emerges, are faster at locatingthe probe when it appears in a position formerly occupied by a threatening wordthan they are when it appears in a neutral position – a disparity not foundamong the non-anxious. Anxious individuals, in other words, have a cognitivebias towards threat.11 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn11]Recently, MacLeod has beenthinking in a different way about the dot probe paradigm. At the outset, aswe’ve just seen, the procedure was instrumental in uncovering precisely what itwas that was driving anxiety – at least, that is, on a cognitive level. Butmight it also have the power to reduce it? To ‘concentrate’ the threat biasaway? MacLeod believes that it does. Not only that, he’s also got the evidenceto prove it.In 2002, he and his co-workers modified the paradigm so that the probe was nolonger random. That is, rather than pop up with equal frequency in the threatand neutral locations, it appeared 100 per cent of the time in either one or theother location: in the case of a threat-related word, the attend threat (AT)condition; in the case of a neutral word, the attend neutral (AN) condition.MacLeod then selected a bunch of volunteers with mid-range anxiety scores (asmeasured by a standardised anxiety questionnaire) and divided them into twogroups. One group got 600 blasts of AT, the other 600 blasts of AN.Could the dot probe be transformed from an experimental paradigm into a trainingparadigm? MacLeod wondered. Was it possible, through repeated attentionaldirection to one or other location, to actually induce biases?The answer, it turned out, was yes. When, at the conclusion of the ‘training’,those in the AT group were presented with a normal dot probe task, they showed –guess what? – increased vigilance for threat-related words. In contrast, thosein the AN group showed increased vigilance for neutral words. Not only that, butwhen the volunteers were given a subsequent anagram-solving test specificallydesigned to make them feel anxious (most of the anagrams might just as well havebeen in Swahili, and some were actually impossible), those in the AN groupexhibited fewer signs of stress than those in the AT group.12 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn12]And the story doesn’t endthere. While MacLeod has been working on attentional training, Andrew Mathewsand Bundy Mackintosh at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridgehave been thinking along similar lines – and developing a technique to modifyhow we interpret situations. From his years as a clinical psychologist at StGeorge’s Hospital in London, Mathews has realised that just as the attention ofanxious individuals is drawn to threatening stimuli in the environment, so, too,are their thought processes. Whereas the rest of us might look on the brightside, anxious individuals, as a rule of thumb, tend to do the opposite – theyinterpret things in a negative, hostile fashion. To illustrate, Mathews providesan example. Once, as a teenager, a colleague of his developed a large pimple onhis face the day he was going out with a new date. Infuriated by the less thansympathetic reaction of his younger brother, he stormed out of the house and saton a bench on top of a nearby mound that overlooked the town. Five minuteslater, a tourist came and sat next to him.‘Nice spot,’ he said …Mathews’ approach is the same as MacLeod’s – except that instead of trainingattention, he trains cognition. In a typical experiment, volunteers arepresented with a bunch of scenarios that must be resolved either positively ornegatively by completing a word fragment at the end. This comprises the trainingphase.For example: ‘Your partner asks you to go to an anniversary dinner that theircompany is holding. You have not met any of their work colleagues before.Getting ready to go, you think that the new people you will meet will find you…’In the condition designed to induce a negative interpretation bias, the wordfragment to be completed would be ‘bo–ng’ (boring) – and you’d work through 100such examples. In the positive bias condition, it would be ‘fri–d-y’ (friendly)– and you’d get 100 of those.Subsequently, in the test phase, volunteers are then presented with anotherbatch of scenarios – similar to the first – except that this time theconclusions remain ambiguous, and are accompanied by a number of possibleoutcomes which are rated for goodness of fit.Exactly as in MacLeod’s attentional training procedure, Mathews finds that thosevolunteers who are trained to interpret things negatively endorse the outcomesmost consonant with that bias – the same being true of those in the positivecondition. Not only that, but on exposure to subsequent stressors (e.g. videoclips of injuries and accidents), those who’ve undergone the positive trainingexhibit less anxiety than those who’ve been given the negative.‘Don’t worry, be happy,’ sang Bobby McFerrin. But it should be the other wayround.PERSUASION PATHWAYSMacLeod and Mathews are optimistic about the future. (Well, they would be,wouldn’t they?) And with good reason. If, as Sam Harris showed us, belief is abrain state, then by changing brain states we should, in theory, be able tochange beliefs. Not just in theory, but in fact. And not just some beliefs, butall of them. Religious, political, you name it.13 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn13]In 2004, a couple of yearsafter his initial modification of the dot probe paradigm, MacLeod used exactlythe same procedure with sufferers of social phobia. Over a two-week period,patients received a daily dose of 384 training trials explicitly diverting theirattention away from threat-related words. Result? A significant reduction insymptoms.14 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn14]A year later, in 2005, MattField and Brian Eastwood at the University of Liverpool adapted CBM for use withheavy drinkers (neutral images vs alcohol-related images). On an ingeniousfollow-up measure of alcohol dependency, they found that those in the ‘attendneutral’ condition sampled less beer in a ‘taste test’ than those in the ‘attendalcohol’ condition.Even more spectacular are studies that have been done on stroke victims. 15[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_nts_r1.htm#c08-ftn15]Edward Taub, at the University ofAlabama, has set up the Taub Therapy Clinic where it’s not unusual to seepatients weighed down by mitts and slings on their good limbs. The reason forthis is not at all obvious – unless you’ve experienced the kind of ‘Aha!’ momentthat Taub has.Taub has discovered that the brains of stroke victims go into a state of‘cortical shock’ after their initial seizure, during which time any attempt tomove affected limbs is met with failure. Over a period of several months, theresult of such failure entails what Taub refers to as ‘learned non-use’ (avariant on the learned helplessness we encountered in Chapter 5[Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c05_r1.htm]) – whereby the neural motor map of thestricken body part (in accordance with the brain’s immutable ‘use it or lose it’principle) begins to atrophy. But force an individual to work the affected area,to persevere in the face of repeated failure (hence the mitts and slings – orthe accoutrements of what Taub calls ‘constraint-induced’ movement therapy), andremarkable strides, quite literally, can be made. The brain can be taught torewire itself: to pack off new generations of dendrites, across uncharted neurallandscapes, in the footsteps of the old. And if you can ‘persuade away’paralysis, then who knows where such influence ends?Elaine Fox, Professor of Psychology at the University of Essex, is taking thingsone stage further than MacLeod and Mathews and, using fMRI, is looking at theeffects of CBM deep within the brain. Her research programme (in collaborationwith Naz Derakshan at the University of London) is currently in its infancy butone of the areas she’ll be keeping a close eye on is the ventromedial prefrontalcortex – which codes, as Sam Harris demonstrated, for the formation of beliefs.In particular, she’ll be watching out for changes in the attentional controlnetworks between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala – and if anything comesup, may well be on her way to solving persuasion’s version of the ‘hardproblem’: by isolating, for the very first time, a discrete ‘persuasion pathway’in the brain.‘It’s not persuasion in the strictest sense of the word,’ says Fox, ‘because inCBM the individual is a willing participant in the belief change process, andthe contingencies of the procedure are subliminal. But as an indicator of whatchanges in the brain when we change our minds, it’s certainly a start.’It certainly is. Whether it’s an open or a fixed mindset; whether themothership’s going to come and get you; or whether you pick up your bed and walk– the code for each of these belief systems is encrypted in the brain in ancientmathematical lightning storms that fork across its surface in milliseconds.Divert the course of these electrochemical data shoals, or modify theirintensity, and you’ll navigate belief along shadowy meridians of influencetowards change.You will, in other words, persuade.Back in Sydney, in the University of Macquarie’s Centre for Cognitive Science, Iprobe a little deeper about the Mirror Man.‘What if he stands over a puddle and strikes a match?’ I ask Max Coltheart,founder of the Belief Formation Programme. ‘He’ll then have to explain how hisalter-ego has accomplished the same feat under water.’Coltheart shrugs. He’s heard it all before.‘Well, he’s managed to explain how his shaving companion has been following himaround the bathroom all this time,’ he says. ‘He’s even caught him in bed withhis wife! So he’ll sure as hell come up with something. The mistake people makeis to think that the answer is somehow rooted in logic. It isn’t. He’s saidhimself that he knows what he says sounds crazy. The problem lies in how hisbrain makes sense of the world. How it orders the sensory data and tries toconstruct an internal, coherent narrative.’And therein lies the secret.‘Cases are won and lost not just on the strength of facts,’ the lawyer MichaelMansfield told us in Chapter 4 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c04_r1.htm], ‘but onimpressions. A lot is achieved through the power of suggestion … It’s not justabout presenting the evidence. It’s about how you present it.’The jury’s still out in Sydney.POSTSCRIPT – PERFECT IMPERFECTIONOne of the questions I’m often asked about split-second persuasion is whetheranyone can do it. Do we all have the ability to wheel and deal at the flippingpoints of life or is it just the prerogative of a privileged few – persuasiongeniuses with a special kind of know-how?My answer is always the same.The issue is one of degree. Most, if not all, of us have a dial-up connection tosome imperishable realm of pure Platonic perfection. And most, if not all, of uswill have occasionally got through to it by accident. When was the last time yousaid exactly the right thing at exactly the right time – only to discover solater? You might not have known it at the time – but, hey, that’s often whatmakes it right!Equally impressive, though dialled a little more frequently, is the direct lineto Platonic imperfection. When was the last time you said exactly the wrongthing at the right time?Easier to remember, no?And I bet you found out quicker.In the lead-up to Christmas, the Royal Mail receives in excess of 750,000letters from children all over the British Isles addressed to Santa. There arestrict regulations for dealing with this kind of correspondence – and thoseletters that don’t accidentally slip into the recycling unit are carefully filedaway. But a couple of years ago one letter in particular succeeded in catchingthe eye of a female employee in one of the regional sorting offices. The letterwas from a little boy who’d been saving up all year for a PlayStation – but whowas only halfway there. His mother was ill and his father had just been laidoff. So the family, as you can imagine, were on a pretty tight budget. CouldSanta come to the rescue (to the tune of £200)?The woman in the sorting office who opened the letter passed it around amongsther colleagues. They were all extremely moved. In fact, so touched were they bythe young lad’s hard work and enterprise – he’d been washing cars and had alsoacquired two paper-rounds – that they decided to hold a collection for him.Everyone contributed generously and by the time they’d finished an envelope with£120 in it sat on the woman’s desk. This she dispatched to the diligent littlefella – with an accompanying note from ‘Santa’ wishing both him and his familyall the very best for the New Year.And that, pretty much, was that. Nothing more came of it. Until, that is,several weeks later in mid-January when a letter addressed to Santa turned up atthe same sorting office. The woman who’d dealt with the first letter alsohandled the second. This is what she read:Dear Santa,Many thanks for your Christmas gift of £200 for my son. It was very generous ofyou. Unfortunately, however, he’s still not managed to get hold of thePlayStation he wanted because when he opened your letter he found that there wasonly £120 inside it. Those thieving bastards at the Post Office must havecreamed off £80 for themselves. I suppose it just goes to show you can’t trustanyone these days …Ouch!Some people, it would seem, are simply not content with getting the wrong end ofthe stick. They insist, instead, on getting the wrong stick. We’ve all beenthere, haven’t we? If experience teaches us anything, it’s this. Behind thefaçade of assiduous, fumbling accomplishment there shimmers a realm ofdespicably effortless incompetence. An imperishable array of faux-pas, cock-upsand howlers that clunks into mortal existence at the whim of the cognitivelychallenged.One evening, outside Cambridge railway station, I found myself muttering in along, disgruntled queue that had gradually been taking shape by the taxi standlike a slow-moving tropical cyclone. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a loudmouth,teenage pisshead sauntered nonchalantly up to the front. With laudablerestraint, the guy standing next to me politely called him aside. And invitedhim, as cordially as the circumstances permitted, to fuck off back down theline. But the impertinent interloper wasn’t having any of it.‘I’ve just had a call to say that my girlfriend’s been rushed to hospital,’ heslurred. ‘And that she’s going straight into surgery. What’s your excuse?’‘I’m the surgeon,’ came the reply.Makes you wonder, doesn’t it?If we can get it so staggeringly wrong – then what is there to stop us fromgetting it so staggeringly right?1 The idea was first proposed by the seventeenth-century Dutch rationalistphilosopher Benedict de Spinoza.2 No such disparity was found with those participants who were not distracted (6years for Mr Nice vs 7 years for Mr Nasty). These guys were able to ‘unbelieve’the false characterisations – leaving no residual difference between the natureof the two crimes.3 Cognitive Behavioural Therapy."},{"pageContent":"Multidimensional Iowa Suggestibility Scale (MISS) (Short Version)Please indicate to what extent the following statements apply to you.

My father, John Dutton, called it a day in the Spring of 2001, andmy friend, the Big Man, threw in his hand less than a year later – on New Year’sDay, 2002. Guys, this book is written in your memory, and goes out with amessage. If you’re up there, somewhere, anywhere – let’s do it all againsometime.The bar that I mention in Camden Town is called the Hawley Arms. Seeing it’swhere everything started, it felt right we should hold the book launch there. Sowe did. I hadn’t been back since the mid-nineties – when Blur, and Oasis, andBritpop were at the top of their game – and the place had certainly changed. Butsome things clearly hadn’t. Later that evening, I had a dinner party to go to –and for one reason or another, never quite made it. You’d have thought I’d havelearned my lesson.In those days I wasn’t married. Now I am. Thank God is all I can say. My wifeElaine has been the epitome of reason, the zenith of understanding, throughoutthis entire project – and her talent for cutting through crap (most of it mine)has proven invaluable. Just prior to publication, I decided to put my cards onthe table. Elaine darling, I asked her (she could tell I was after something),Will you support me through my sex, drugs and rock n’roll phase? I already have,she replied. Damn. I mean, thanks Elaine. And I love you.In writing this book, it seems as if I’ve had more agents than MI5. PeterTallack, Patrick Walsh, Clare Conville, Jake Smith Bosanquet, and ChristyFletcher have all performed heroically in keeping the show on the road – andwhen I managed to exhaust even their collective wisdom, Nick Kent kicked a fewloose balls off the line (usually in glittering restaurants over the finestpinot noir.) Don’t know if anyone’s ever put it quite like this before, Nick –but you’re great between the posts.I would also like to thank the following friends and colleagues for their adviceand feedback during the course of writing this book. If I’ve missed anybody out,I’m afraid you’re just going to have to face it – you weren’t that important:Dominic Abrams, Denis Alexander, Mike Anderson, Sue Armstrong, Phil Barnard,Michael Brooks, Peter Chadwick, Alex Christofi, Robert Cialdini, Max Coltheart,Keith Crosby, Jules Davidoff, Richard Dawkins, Roger Deeble, George Ellis, BenElton, Dan Fagin, Dan Gilbert, Andy Green, Cathy Grossman, Greg Heinimann, PaulaHertel, Rodney Holder, Emily Holmes, John Horgan, Stephen Joseph, Herb Kelman,Deborah Kent, Linda Lantieri, Colin MacLeod, Bundy Mackintosh, Andrew Mathews,Ray Meddis, Ravi Mirchandani, Harry Newman, Pippa Newman, Richard Newman,Stephen Pinker, Martin Redfern, Russell Re-Manning, Gill Rhodes, V.

On May 9th, 1982, Hugh Jones toed the starting line of theLondon Marathon on Blackheath Common. Two hours, nine minutes, and twenty-fourseconds later (as a fifteen year old, I remember watching that race on TV as ifit were yesterday), he crossed the finish line some three minutes ahead of hisnearest rival. A few years later, I got to know Hugh and his family in London;we used to run together in Regent’s Park (he could never keep up with me), andthen have dinner at his house in Camden.

In fact, receipt of reward andavoidance of punishment comprise the twin pillars of pretty much any kind ofinfluence you can think of, from child-rearing, through puppy training, to themore esoteric and Machiavellian endpoints of consciously shaped behaviour suchas that found in sniffer dogs and, very nearly, in pigeons during the SecondWorld War.Project Pigeon was the brainchild of American psychologist B. F. Skinner andconstituted the codename for a scheme aimed at developing a pigeon-guidedmissile. The idea, if eccentric, was simple. A lens affixed to the front of themissile would project an image of the target on to an interior screen, while apigeon, previously trained through operant conditioning to recognize it, (i.e.rewarded with food for incrementally accurate differentiation) pecked at itsadjustable surface. So long as the pecks were directed centre-screen the missilewould remain on course. But pecks directed off-centre would cause the screen totilt, resulting, via a link to the missile’s control system, in the flight pathdeviating accordingly.Unfortunately, despite an initial outlay of $25,000 by the US National DefenseResearch Committee, and encouraging results early on, the project, so to speak,never got off the ground. Birdbrains and missile defense, the committeeconcluded, were a bad combination.Conditioning, of course, doesn’t always have to take place consciously.Sometimes, unlike with the pigeons, self-interest can be manipulated without oureven knowing, and the association between performing a certain behaviour(pecking) and achieving a given outcome (food) forged implicitly.Katie: Mum, can I have an ice-lolly?Mum: (Takes no notice and continues lying on sun lounger.)Katie: Mum, I want an ice-lolly.

She knows from experience: she’s beenhoning her skills right from the day she was born!

He found that students whowere tired were more likely to accept a two-month cut in holiday over the summerthan those who were fresh.)But persistence isn’t always a means to an end. It can, on occasion, constitutethe end itself: the behaviour that’s being rewarded. This peculiar dynamic isthe psychology behind gambling and fishing, and is what makes both these ancientpastimes so difficult to walk away from.

Generally, if an attitude isprimarily ‘cognitive’ in nature (i.e. emerges from how we think aboutsomething), then logical, rational argument by far and away constitutes the mosteffective tool in bringing about change. If, on the other hand, an attitude isprimarily ‘affective’ in nature (i.e. has to do with how we feel aboutsomething), then an appeal to the emotions offers the best strategy.This might sound complicated, but it is actually something that most of usalready know. Think, for instance, of the advertising industry. Anyone whoattempts to sell perfume by extolling the virtues of its chemical composition,or drain-unblocker by its power to make one irresistible to members of theopposite sex, is not, in all likelihood, going to be the next Bill Gates.Closely linked to the content of a persuasive message is the way in which we, asrecipients, process the information within it. As with message composition,there are two main routes to persuasion here, the Central Route and PeripheralRoute (see figure below), the critical differential this time residing less inthe manner in which we reach our conclusions (whether we use our head or ourheart), and more in our motives for doing so.Two routes to persuasion: Central vs peripheralBroadly speaking, we tend to process information via the central route when itis of high personal relevance to us: in other words, when it really matters.Normally, this entails an in-depth appraisal of the quality of specificarguments, and results in lasting attitude change. In contrast, the peripheralroute is activated under conditions of low personal involvement: when the stakesare not so high. Peripheral processing of a message or argument is characterisedby a reduced focus on the details and an enhanced reliance on superficialfactors such as the physical attractiveness of the communicator, or the way inwhich they are dressed. Thus, just as we wouldn’t recruit a biochemist to marketa perfume, or a supermodel to sell drain-unblocker, we’d be similarlyill-advised to choose our mortgage broker purely on the strength of his Elvisimpersonation; or, alternatively, insist on a full explication of the laws ofquantum physics before rolling the dice in a game of Trivial Pursuit.[images/Dutt_9780307374615_epub_053_r1.jpg]Recall from Chapter 2 how good-looking individuals make more money on charitystands than those of average looks? Now you know why. Most of us already harbourthe notion that giving to charity is good, and, from a strictly intellectualpoint of view (the kind handled by the central route of persuasion) need nofurther convincing. Rather, cue peripheral route, we need inducing.For more on the science of attitude-change, see: Crano, William D. and Prislin,Radmila, ‘Attitudes and persuasion.’ Annual Review of Psychology 57 (2006):345–374.20 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-ftn20a] In fact, research hasshown … Greatbatch, David and Heritage, John, ‘Generating Applause: A Study ofRhetoric and Response at Party Political Conferences.’ The American Journal ofSociology 92 (1986): 110–157.21 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-ftn21a] Or take Stanley Milgram’selectric shocks experiment … In 1963, Milgram published a study that has nowassumed iconic status in the field of experimental psychology – and which hasarguably gone down as the most celebrated, certainly the most combustible, inthe discipline’s hundred-or-so-year history. Milgram devised a simulatedlearning paradigm in which participants (recruited from a random sample ofrespectable, middle-class Americans) were allocated the role of ‘teacher’opposite an associate of the researcher (the ‘learner’). But this was to be noordinary teaching assignment. ‘Mistakes’ were to be punished by theadministration of electric shocks – minimal at the outset but escalating to abrutal 450 volts as errors perpetuated. Ostensibly, the study was presented asan investigation into short-term memory. And ostensibly, the electric shockswere real. But, in reality, the actual focus was on obedience – and the shockswere a sham. The aim was chillingly simple: To what extremes, Milgram wanted toknow, were everyday, law-abiding American citizens prepared to go wheninstructed by an authority figure?

Back in the early sixties, the social psychologists Muzafer Sherifand Carl Hovland put forward the notion that attitudes, like earthquakes, haveepicenters – and that the greater the distance between the ‘eye’ of a person’sbelief and the fulcrum of an influence attempt, the less likely they are to beswayed. The key, according to Sherif and Hovland, is to pitch a message withinthe target’s ‘latitude of acceptance’ – in other words, to make sure thatwhatever it is you’re proposing isn’t so ‘off the scale’ as to be rejected bythem outright. Imagine, for instance, that you’re trying to persuade a friend tolose weight. Do you think you’d stand a better chance if you signed them up fora marathon – or extolled the benefits of a gentle walk round the block?Framing, needless to say, is often the persuader’s sneaky secret weapon when itcomes to latitudes of acceptance. An example occurred with a friend of mine – amacho, muscle-bound guy whose anger-management issues were threatening to wreckhis marriage. The thought of taking time out to meditate was a total no-no tohim – the preserve of counselors, hippies and other ‘middle-class puffs.’ Thenhe made a discovery: meditation, as well as being practiced by dreadlockedsuburban yogis, was also endemic to many of the martial arts. That, of course,was different. Suddenly, the idea of taking time out wasn’t so namby-pamby afterall – and he embarked on a regular routine.For the original work on latitudes of acceptance and rejection, see MuzaferSherif and Carl Hovland, Social judgment: Assimilation and contrast effects incommunication and attitude change (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1961).34 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-ftn34a] Recently, the CIA … EphraimHardcastle, Mail Online. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1213906/[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1213906/] EPHRAIM-HARDCASTLE.html(accessed October 19th, 2009).35 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-ftn35a] Research has shown … Carlson,Michael, Charlin, Ventura and Miller, Norman, ‘Positive Mood and HelpingBehavior: A Test of Six Hypotheses.’ Journal of Personality and SocialPsychology 55 (1988): 211–229.36 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c06_r1.htm#c06-ftn36a] Research, forexample … Winkielman, Piotr and Cacioppo, John T., ‘Mind at Ease Puts Smile onthe Face: Psycho-physiological Evidence That Processing Facilitation ElicitsPositive Affect.’ Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 81(6) (2001):989–1000.1 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-ftn1a] The PsychopathyChecklist-Revised (PCL-R) … Hare, Robert D., The Hare Psychopathy Checklist –Revised (PCL-R), 2nd edn (Toronto, Ontario: Multi-Health Systems, 2003).2 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-ftn2a] Psychologists Scott Lilienfeldand Brian Andrews … Lilienfeld, Scott O. and Andrews, Brian P., ‘Development andPreliminary Validation of a Self-Report Measure of Psychopathic Personality inNoncriminal Populations.’ Journal of Personality Assessment 66 (1996): 488–524.3 [Dutt_9780307374615_epub_c07_r1.htm#c07-ftn3a] There are two types … For ascholarly, and accessible introduction to empathy see Mark H.

There’sevidence to suggest that there might be. Neuroscientist Richard Davidson at theUniversity of Wisconsin, with the help of the Dalai Lama, has been studying whatgoes on inside the brains of Buddhist monks – the Olympic athletes of themeditation world, as he calls them – while they perform an advanced kind ofmeditation called ‘compassionate’ meditation. Using EEG, Davidson has found thatwhen the monks enter into an intensely compassionate state their heightenedfocus on unconditional love is accompanied by a unique neural signature – whichincludes gamma waves 30 times stronger than normal, and increased activity inthe left prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain responsible for positiveemotions). Results such as these, Davidson maintains, have importantimplications for ongoing research into ‘neuroplasticity’ – the ability of anindividual to change brain function through training. Just as the part of thebrain that corresponds to a violinist’s fingering hand develops more than thepart that controls the bow hand, so Davidson proposes that the right kind of‘training’ can also extend to the emotion centres of the brain – and we can bulkup on empathy just like we can on any other ‘muscle’. (For more on RichardDavidson’s work see the website for the Lab for Affective Neuroscience at theUniversity of Wisconsin: http://psyphz.psych.wisc.edu/[http://psyphz.psych.wisc.edu/]).In his book The Wisdom of Forgiveness, the Dalai Lama tells the story ofLopon-la – a Tibetan monk whom he had known in Lhasa before the Chineseinvasion, and as good a candidate as any for the title of ‘anti psychopath’.Lopon-la was imprisoned for eighteen years by the Chinese – and then, on hisrelease, fled to India. Twenty years after his ordeal, he and the Dalai Lamawere finally reunited.‘He seemed the same,’ the Dalai Lama recounts. ‘His mind still sharp after somany years in prison. He was still the same gentle monk … They tortured him manytimes in prison. I asked him whether he was ever afraid. Lopon-la then told me,‘Yes, there was one thing I was afraid of.
