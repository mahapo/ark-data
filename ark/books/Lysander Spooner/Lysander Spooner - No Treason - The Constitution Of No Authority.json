Martin is chairman of the Department of History, Rampart CollegeGraduate School, Larkspur, Colorado. A revisionist, Dr. Martin has won a broadreputation for scholarship in his work as instructor at Deep Springs College,San Francisco State College, Northern Illinois University, and the University ofMichigan, and for his published works which include American Liberalism andWorld Politics, 1931–1941 (New York: The Devin-Adair Company, 1964); Men Againstthe State (first published in 1953 and republished in 1957); and Meditations onthe Early Wisdom of John Foster Dulles (1958).

Hehas contributed to the Dictionary of American Biography (1958) and theEncyclopædia Britannica (1962).Dr. Martin was born in St. Leonard, New Brunswick on September 18, 1916. Hereceived his bachelor of arts degree in history at the University of NewHampshire in 1942, his master of arts degree (1945), and doctor of philosophy(1949) in history, at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and has won manyhonors in the course of his career.It is entirely due to the efforts of Dr. Martin that this publication,containing two of Lysander Spooner’s most significant works, is appearing atthis time. Spooner, after nearly a hundred years, remains a controversialfigure. His crisp and incisive verbiage, his utter ruthlessness in pursuit of animportant though possibly obscure point, have made him something of a paladin inlibertarian circles. If lawyers, judges, and the host of government employeeswould examine what Lysander Spooner has to say about their positions inascendancy over ordinary people, something of a long-needed humility mightevolve.In any case, Dr. Martin’s untiring labor in bringing to light an almostforgotten argument in support of pure liberty has resulted in this slim volume,which includes his own valued biography of Lysander Spooner and something of thebackground from which Mr. Spooner wrote.Robert LeFevreDean, Rampart College"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONBY JAMES J. MARTINSince late Neolithic times, men in their political capacity have lived almostexclusively by myths. And these political myths have continued to evolve,proliferate, and grow more complex and intricate, even though there has been asteady replacement of one by another, over the centuries. A series of entirelytheoretical constructs, sometimes mystical, usually deductive and speculative,they seek to explain the status and relationships in the community since itbecame discernibly organized, politically. But in essence these constructs areall alike in that with varying degrees of persuasiveness they attempt to examinethe origins of the State with little or no attention to its historic record, andthen try to justify and fortify it in the face of criticism or objection.In the long millennia during which theological authorizations of one kind oranother were principally employed to sanctify the State and to promote itssafety and continuity, we know very little of the critics and their products.Threats of divine retaliation by the gods upon any so sinful as to question thevalidity of the State may have been sufficient to inhibit the crime ofdeviationism. On the other hand, perhaps many ages may have had a formidableroster of adversaries of the State, but theirs must apparently have been largelyan oral tradition, and has been lost to posterity with hardly a trace. A scrapor two have come down to us from the Orient, but ancient literary survivals areessentially a Statist apologia.Undoubtedly the largest part of such criticisms may have subjectively denouncedthe more obvious vulnerabilities of the institution, particularly its capacityfor promoting institutionalized robbery, murder, injustice, and tyranny. Tracesof such protest are discernible in the traditions of many peoples.But the unvarying, wearisome replacement of one State by another for thousandsof years reveals the depth of the fixation humankind has had concerning it, inpart testifying, as Ludwig Gumplowicz and Franz Oppenheimer and others haveobserved, to the long-standing drive to make a living without working, a stagewhich has been tied to the evolution of productive processes to a point where asurplus existed beyond the needs of the producer. (The steady increase in thenumbers who batten upon the substance of the productive community in the name ofthe State testifies in turn not to a mellowing expansiveness, a generousenlargement of the preying nomad band, as Oppenheimer would have it, but to theprodigious increase in production totals beyond subsistence or survival demandsof the former.)Oppenheimer described the United States of America a halfcentury ago (in TheState [Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1914], p. 17) as “among the most powerfulState-formations in all history.” Its prodigious growth since that time wouldsurely have prompted him to elevate it to first place, and perhaps decades ago,had he lived to make such observations.There is no apparent logic or law regulating the age-old conflict between theindividual and the collectivity, between the State and the idea or the realityof the voluntary social system. However, in America, the site of the evolutionof the mightiest State of all time, there has been an inverse ratio between itsgrowth and the production of native anti-Statism. Vasilii Klyuchevski, the giantof historical scholarship in the last century of Czarist Russia, put it best:“The State swells up; the people diminish.” Part of the reason for this has beenthe much more opaque and intangible nature of the adversary. No stylized,symbolic vested agents, such as perhaps a traditional oligarchical priesthood ofantiquity or a divine-right monarch, have existed here to provide a convenienttarget for word or deed. The tying of political tenure to astronomy instead ofto dynasty has removed the possibility of a long-enduring personal symbol fromthe scene. And a massive obstacle has been created as a result of thehomogenization growing out of mass voting, mass taxpaying, mass gun-bearing, andmass dispersal of the tidbits bestowed by the State; a vast, gray, shapelessenterprise has come into being, with which it has been difficult to come togrips, as in the manner of classical conflicts with the State.One of the important consequences of all this has been a difference in thestructure and strategy of Statist apologetics in America. There has been amarked diminution over the years in the invocation of the Deity as responsiblefor its installation and overall direction and protection. Divine-right andrelated theories have never enjoyed a vogue at all. The American genius has beenconcentrated in perfecting vague and generalized secular verbiage; elusive,imprecise terminology which often sets the line for seemingly interminablebattlegrounds of conflicting interpretation. Expressions such as “generalwelfare,” “public good,” “social contract,” “general will,” and many others,come to mind.Of course, the crowning achievement in the American experience was theproduction of the Constitution, the ultimate verbal bastion on which is perchedthe American State. Constitution-worship is our most extended public politicalritual, frequently supervised as often by mountebanks as by the sincere. This isan unusual enterprise in world history, in view of the casual attitude towardsuch developments in most places and at most times. In point of service, it iseasily the oldest such political document in history, which adds much to the aweand veneration in which it is held. For though we have had over a century ofnative critics and opponents of our State, from Warren, Thoreau, and Tucker downto Albert Jay Nock and Frank Chodorov, the Constitution has largely beenexempted or neglected in the unfolding of this critical tradition.In America, we see, therefore, a different basis for the defense of the State.Lacking dynastic families, entrenched aristocracies, nobilities, royalties, andother ostensible residuaries of State power and beneficiaries of Stateemoluments, both the attack and the defense have moved to the abstract sector.For sure, in the final analysis, the State must be viewed as certain people. ButMarx’s definition of the State as the executive committee of the ruling classmeans little in an American context. If one can say that such an entity has everexisted here, its composition has been so mixed and so varying, and its tenureso transitory, that for specific purposes such a description is almost useless.No sustained, unbroken line of material profiteers from our State can beestablished. The bewildering turnover of elected personnel and the multiplicityof their fortunes virtually eliminate such temporary wielders of power fromqualifying as reliable custodians of the State. This has been dramatized manytimes by the dispossessed from office complaining bitterly and vehemently overtheir unhappy treatment by the State, in their turn. (One need not mention theelectrifying phenomenon of the last fifty years, namely, the growth ofadministrative government, with increasingly larger amounts of power anddiscretion in the hands of persons who have not even been elected to anything,and who often stand at the elbow of the familiar “responsible” public figuresand who are more often than not the real authors of the policies and programsfor which the latter are credited or blamed, as political fortunes would haveit.)Consequently, in view of the evanescent nature of power tenure in this country,the frequent unhorsing of the holders and exercisers of State power is lookedupon with equanimity and not considered a threat in any way to the State. It isthe assault upon the abstract and verbal underpinnings of this institution whichdraws blood, so to speak. If one can consider all the participants in thestruggle to control and use the State as those engaged in a game (the book byMorgenstern and Neumann on the theory of games, in which war politics areexamined in this context, deserves more study),[1] then those who seek todestroy the abstract-verbal justification for such “play” are endangering thefuture course of all the players by riddling the rule books, which describe howsuch play is to be conducted while giving it a raison d’être besides. Those whoattack the rationale of the game, and not the players, are its most formidableadversaries.It is in the light of this that those who have the temerity to collide head-onwith the Constitution and challenge its validity in toto stand out in such sharpoutline and radiate a quality of uniqueness in the American anti-State library.And at the head of this category stands Lysander Spooner (1808–1887), whosemajor work in this offensive, No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority, isreproduced below from the original edition, written in 1869 and published inBoston in 1870. It is the last of a series bearing the identical main titlewhich were to have been six in number, although this one, numbered the sixth,was actually only the third. (No Treason Nos. 3, 4, and 5 never appeared, forreasons never explained.) But in view of the scope of this work, it does notseem that anything pertinent was left unsaid, making necessary any furtherelaboration.Spooner strips away the support from any and all who conjure up one or anotherpersuasive explanation of the Constitution as a contract, or as an agentfacilitating a contract theory of government. A practicing jurist all his adultlife, Spooner puts the Constitution to the test of contracts “on generalprinciples of law and reason,” such as prevailed in public affairs and in themarket place where he worked with people from day to day, and concludes that itdoes not meet any of the basic criteria for contracts at all, and was not validor binding on anyone. The sort of mystical osmosis, akin to telepathy, perhaps,by which Americans were supposed to have contracted with one or another tofunction under the document at the launching of the post-Revolutionary WarAmerican State, evaporates in Spooners path as he assembles his argument, lineby line, in nineteen carefully reasoned sections.Spooner does not find that the Constitution “says” anything, because it cannottalk. But he does see it as a device through which judges talk, explaining whatit “said” to those who live under it. Since not even its creators signed it, theConstitution was not even binding on them, Spooner argued. (The appearance ofprintings of the Constitution in modem times which bear signatures of thedrafters of the document does not affect Spooner s point, which remainsunaltered; the intent of this latter-day device is not discernible, but can beinterpreted to be little more than an annotation and not an attempt to assertthat there is a contractual connotation here, as in the case of the signaturesgracing the Declaration of Independence.) And as for later times, there was noevidence that it had any binding quality upon their posterity, while all whoacted under it were anonymous agents of concealed persons, who were engaged ininflicting the will of these persons upon others in an invasive manner. He wenton with ingenious demolition of the arguments that voting or tax-paying wereevidence of voluntary submission to those who ruled in the name of theConstitution, and challenged any office-holder or wielder of power who mightclaim accurately and precisely to identify those in whose name he functioned,and with whose assent he acted to make their will prevail, to do so.There is much internal evidence that Spooner believed the Constitution had beenput to the supreme test by Secession and the ensuing Civil War, barely fouryears ended when he wrote No Treason, and that the document was a proven failureif it purported to be a voluntary compact entered into by all for the object ofpromoting various mutual benefits and comforts. The mere fact that so many liveslost and so much violence and blood had been necessary, for those who wanted theConstitution, to make it prevail over those who did not want it, was sufficientevidence to him that there was no difference between the American Stateexperiment and that of all those before it which streamed away into the past.The party with the most men and guns had prevailed, and it angered and incensedhim to hear political thimbleriggers bray of having “saved the country” and“preserved our glorious Union,” while “maintaining the national honor.”Spooner was not trying to sympathize with the Southern cause, though heneglected to point out that the defeated Confederacy was no less State-mindedthan the Northern “Union,” that it had preceded the period of hostilities withConstitution-making on its own account, ending up with one which includedseveral sections even more objectionable than the one he was attacking. Hiseffort instead was devoted to revealing how far removed from a “government byconsent” or a “voluntary union of free men” the actual situation really was.Spooner disparaged the theory that the center of the contest concerned theinstitution of slavery, and advanced an economic interpretation of the war inharmony with others which have appeared since, propounded by critics of theState and others not so disposed, alike. Says Spooner in conclusion, speaking ofthe Constitution, “This much is certain—that it has either authorized such agovernment as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it. In either case,it is unfit to exist.”For sheer audacity and breath-taking boldness, No Treason remains unmatched. Onecannot call to mind anything to compare with it. In order to justify thecontinuance of the Constitution as the foundation-stone of the American State,one must seek other entrenched positions from which to make the defense thanfrom that of any school of theoretical contractualism, after encounteringSpooner.No Treason presumes a bit more than minimum acquaintance with political andlegal theory and practice, and the semantics of Statism, on the part of itsreaders. But one is unlikely to encounter another exercise in thinking whichexceeds it in providing a more brilliant insight into the mystical speculativepresumptions of the apologists for constitutionally-based Statism whoseideological roots are lodged in eighteenth century beliefs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] John Von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, The Theory of Games and EconomicBehavior (2nd ed.; Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1947)."},{"pageContent":"NO TREASON.NO. VI.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE CONSTITUTION OF NO AUTHORITY.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------BY LYSANDER SPOONER.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------BOSTON:PUBLISHED BY THE AUTHOR.1870."},{"pageContent":"NO TREASONTHE CONSTITUTION OF NO AUTHORITYI.The Constitution has no inherent authority or obligation. It has no authority orobligation at all, unless as a contract between man and man. And it does not somuch as even purport to be a contract between persons now existing. It purports,at most, to be only a contract between persons living eighty years ago.[1] Andit can be supposed to have been a contract then only between persons who hadalready come to years of discretion, so as to be competent to make reasonableand obligatory contracts. Furthermore, we know, historically, that only a smallportion even of the people then existing were consulted on the subject, orasked, or permitted to express either their consent or dissent in any formalmanner. Those persons, if any, who did give their consent formally, are all deadnow. Most of them have been dead forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy years. And theConstitution, so far as it was their contract, died with them. They had nonatural power or right to make it obligatory upon their children. It is not onlyplainly impossible, in the nature of things, that they could bind theirposterity, but they did not even attempt to bind them. That is to say, theinstrument does not purport to be an agreement between any body but “the people”then existing; nor does it, either expressly or impliedly, assert any right,power, or disposition, on their part, to bind anybody but themselves. Let ussee. Its language is:> We, the people of the United States (that is, the people then existing in the> United States), in order to farm a more perfect union, insure domestic> tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and> secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves ana our posterity, do ordain and> establish this Constitution for the United States of America.It is plain, in the first place, that this language, as an agreement, purportsto be only what it at most really was, viz., a contract between the people thenexisting; and, of necessity, binding, as a contract, only upon those thenexisting. In the second place, the language neither expresses nor implies thatthey had any intention or desire, nor that they imagined they had any right orpower, to bind their “posterity” to live under it. It does not say that their“posterity” will, shall, or must live under it. It only says, in effect, thattheir hopes and motives in adopting it were that it might prove useful to theirposterity, as well as to themselves, by promoting their union, safety,tranquility, liberty, etc.Suppose an agreement were entered into, in this form:We, the people of Boston, agree to maintain a fort on Governor’s Island, toprotect ourselves and our posterity against invasion.This agreement, as an agreement, would clearly bind nobody but the people thenexisting. Secondly, it would assert no right, power, or disposition, on theirpart, to compel their “posterity” to maintain such a fort. It would onlyindicate that the supposed welfare of their posterity was one of the motivesthat induced the original parties to enter into the agreement.When a man says he is building a house for himself and his posterity, he doesnot mean to be understood as saying that he has any thought of binding them, noris it to be inferred that he is so foolish as to imagine that he has any rightor power to bind them, to live in it. So far as they are concerned, he onlymeans to be understood as saying that his hopes and motives, in building it, arethat they, or at least some of them, may find it for their happiness to live init.So when a man says he is planting a tree for himself and his posterity, he doesnot mean to be understood as saying that he has any thought of compelling them,nor is it to be inferred that he is such a simpleton as to imagine that he hasany right or power to compel them, to eat the fruit. So far as they areconcerned, he only means to say that his hopes and motives, in planting thetree, are that its fruit may be agreeable to them.So it was with those who originally adopted the Constitution. Whatever may havebeen their personal intentions, the legal meaning of their language, so far astheir “posterity” was concerned, simply was, that their hopes and motives, inentering into the agreement, were that it might prove useful and acceptable totheir posterity; that it might promote their union, safety, tranquility, andwelfare; and that it might tend “to secure to them the blessings of liberty.”The language does not assert nor at all imply, any right, power, or disposition,on the part of the original parties to the agreement, to compel their“posterity” to live under it. If they had intended to bind their posterity tolive under it, they should have said that their object was, not “to secure tothem the blessings of liberty,” but to make slaves of them; for if their“posterity” are bound to live under it, they are nothing less than the slaves oftheir foolish, tyrannical, and dead grandfathers.It cannot be said that the Constitution formed “the people of the UnitedStates,” for all time, into a corporation. It does not speak of “the people” asa corporation, but as individuals. A corporation does not describe itself as“we,” nor as “people,” nor as “ourselves.” Nor does a corporation, in legallanguage, have any “posterity.” It supposes itself to have, and speaks of itselfas having, perpetual existence, as a single individuality.Moreover, no body of men, existing at any one time, have the power to create aperpetual corporation. A corporation can become practically perpetual only bythe voluntary accession of new members, as the old ones die off. But for thisvoluntary accession of new members, the corporation necessarily dies with thedeath of those who originally composed it.Legally speaking, therefore, there is, in the Constitution, nothing thatprofesses or attempts to bind the “posterity” of those who established it.If, then, those who established the Constitution, had no power to bind, and didnot attempt to bind, their posterity, the question arises, whether theirposterity have bound themselves. If they have done so, they can have done so inonly one or both of these two ways, viz., by voting, and paying taxes.II.Let us consider these two matters, voting and tax paying, separately. And firstof voting.All the voting that has ever taken place under the Constitution, has been ofsuch a kind that it not only did not pledge the whole people to support theConstitution, but it did not even pledge any one of them to do so, as thefollowing considerations show.1. In the very nature of things, the act of voting could bind nobody but theactual voters. But owing to the property qualifications required, it is probablethat, during the first twenty or thirty years under the Constitution, not morethan one-tenth, fifteenth, or perhaps twentieth of the whole population (blackand white, men, women, and minors) were permitted to vote. Consequently, so faras voting was concerned, not more than one-tenth, fifteenth, or twentieth ofthose then existing, could have incurred any obligation to support theConstitution.[2]At the present time,[3] it is probable that not more than one-sixth of the wholepopulation are permitted to vote. Consequently, so far as voting is concerned,the other five-sixths can have given no pledge that they will support theConstitution.2. Of the one-sixth that are permitted to vote, probably not more thantwo-thirds (about one-ninth of the whole population) have usually voted. Manynever vote at all. Many vote only once in two, three, five, or ten years, inperiods of great excitement.No one, by voting, can be said to pledge himself for any longer period than thatfor which he votes. If, for example, I vote for an officer who is to hold hisoffice for only a year, I cannot be said to have thereby pledged myself tosupport the government beyond that term. Therefore, on the ground of actualvoting, it probably cannot be said that more than one-ninth or one-eighth, ofthe whole population are usually under any pledge to support theConstitution.[4]3. It cannot be said that, by voting, a man pledges himself to support theConstitution, unless the act of voting be a perfectly voluntary one on his part.Yet the act of voting cannot properly be called a voluntary one on the part ofany very large number of those who do vote. It is rather a measure of necessityimposed upon them by others, than one of their own choice. On this point Irepeat what was said in a former number,[a] viz.:> “In truth, in the case of individuals, their actual voting is not to be taken,> as proof of consent, even for the time being. On the contrary, it is to be> considered that, without his consent having even been asked a man finds> himself environed by a government that he cannot resist; a government that> forces him to pay money, render service, and forego the exercise of many of> his natural rights, under peril of weighty punishments. He sees, too, that> other men practice this tyranny over him by the use of the ballot. He sees> further, that, if he will but use the ballot himself, he has some chance of> relieving himself from this tyranny of others, by subjecting them to his own.> In short, he finds himself, without his consent, so situated that, if he use> the ballot, he may become a master; if he does not use it, he must become a> slave. And he has no other alternative than these two. In self-defence, he> attempts the former. His case is analogous to that of a man who has been> forced into battle, where he must either kill others, or be killed himself.> Because, to save his own life in battle, a man attempts to take the lives of> his opponents, it is not to be inferred that the battle is one of his own> choosing. Neither in contests with the ballot—which is a mere substitute for a> bullet—because, as his only chance of self-preservation, a man uses a ballot,> is it to be inferred that the contest is one into which he voluntarily> entered; that he voluntarily set up all his own natural rights, as a stake> against those of others, to be lost or won by the mere power of numbers. On> the contrary, it is to be considered that, in an exigency into which he had> been forced by others, and in which no other means of self-defence offered,> he, as a matter of necessity, used the only one that was left to him.> > “Doubtless the most miserable of men, under the most oppressive government in> the world, if allowed the ballot, would use it, if they could see any chance> of thereby meliorating their condition. But it would not, therefore, be a> legitimate inference that the government itself, that crushes them, was one> which they had voluntarily set up, or even consented to.> > “Therefore, a man’s voting under the Constitution of the United States, is not> to be taken as evidence that he ever freely assented to the Constitution, even> for the time being. Consequently we have no proof that any very large portion,> even of the actual voters of the United States, ever really and voluntarily> consented to the Constitution, even for the time being. Nor can we ever have> such proof, until every man is left perfectly free to consent, or not, without> thereby subjecting himself or his property to be disturbed or injured by> others.”As we can have no legal knowledge as to who votes from choice, and who from thenecessity thus forced upon him, we can have no legal knowledge, as to anyparticular individual, that he voted from choice; or, consequently, that byvoting, he consented, or pledged himself, to support the government. Legallyspeaking, therefore, the act of voting utterly fails to pledge any one tosupport the government. It utterly fails to prove that the government rests uponthe voluntary support of anybody. On general principles of law and reason, itcannot be said that the government has any voluntary supporters at all, until itcan be distinctly shown who its voluntary supporters are.4. As taxation is made compulsory on all, whether they vote or not, a largeproportion of those who vote, no doubt do so to prevent their own money beingused against themselves; when, in fact, they would have gladly abstained fromvoting, if they could thereby have saved themselves from taxation alone, to saynothing of being saved from all the other usurpations and tyrannies of thegovernment. To take a man’s property without his consent, and then to infer hisconsent because he attempts, by voting, to prevent that property from being usedto his injury, is a very insufficient proof of his consent to support theConstitution. It is, in fact, no proof at all. And as we can have no legalknowledge as to who the particular individuals are, if there are any, who arewilling to be taxed for the sake of voting, we can have no legal knowledge thatany particular individual consents to be taxed for the sake of voting; or,consequently, consents to support the Constitution.5. At nearly all elections, votes are given for various candidates for the sameoffice. Those who vote for the unsuccessful candidates cannot properly be saidto have voted to sustain the Constitution. They may, with more reason, besupposed to have voted, not to support the Constitution, but specially toprevent the tyranny which they anticipate the successful candidate intends topractice upon them under color of the Constitution; and therefore may reasonablybe supposed to have voted against the Constitution itself. This supposition isthe more reasonable, inasmuch as such voting is the only mode allowed to them ofexpressing their dissent to the Constitution.6. Many votes are usually given for candidates who have no prospect of success.Those who give such votes may reasonably be supposed to have voted as they did,with a special intention, not to support, but to obstruct the execution of, theConstitution; and, therefore, against the Constitution itself.7. As all the different votes are given secretly (by secret ballot), there is nolegal means of knowing, from the votes themselves, who votes for, and whoagainst, the Constitution. Therefore, voting affords no legal evidence that anyparticular individual supports the Constitution. And where there can be no legalevidence that any particular individual supports the Constitution, it cannotlegally be said that anybody supports it. It is clearly impossible to have anylegal proof of the intentions of large numbers of men, where there can be nolegal proof of the intentions of any particular one of them.8. There being no legal proof of any man’s intentions, in voting, we can onlyconjecture them. As a conjecture, it is probable, that a very large proportionof those who vote, do so on this principle, viz., that if, by voting, they couldbut get the government into their own hands (or that of their friends), and useits powers against their opponents, they would then willingly support theConstitution; but if their opponents are to have the power, and use it againstthem, then they would not willingly support the Constitution.In short, men’s voluntary support of the Constitution is doubtless, in mostcases, wholly contingent upon the question whether, by means of theConstitution, they can make themselves masters, or are to be made slaves.Such contingent consent as that is, in law and reason, no consent at all.9. As everybody who supports the Constitution by voting (if there are any such)does so secretly (by secret ballot), and in a way to avoid all personalresponsibility for the act of his agents or representatives, it cannot legallyor reasonably be said that anybody at all supports the Constitution by voting.No man can reasonably or legally be said to do such a thing as to assent to, orsupport, the Constitution, unless he does it openly, and in a way to makehimself personally responsible for the acts of his agents, so long as they actwithin the limits of the power he delegates to them.10. As all voting is secret (by secret ballot), and as all secret governmentsare necessarily only secret bands of robbers, tyrants, and murderers, thegeneral fact that our government is practically carried on by means of suchvoting, only proves that there is among us a secret band of robbers, tyrants andmurderers, whose purpose is to rob, enslave, and, so far as necessary toaccomplish their purposes, murder, the rest of the people. The simple fact ofthe existence of such a band does nothing towards proving that “the people ofthe United States,” or any one of them, voluntarily supports the Constitution.For all the reasons that have now been given, voting furnishes no legal evidenceas to who the particular individuals are (if there are any), who voluntarilysupport the Constitution. It therefore furnishes no legal evidence that anybodysupports it voluntarily.So far, therefore, as voting is concerned, the Constitution, legally speaking,has no supporters at all.And, as matter of fact, there is not the slightest probability that theConstitution has a single bona fide supporter in the country. That is to say,there is not the slightest probability that there is a single man in thecountry, who both understands what the Constitution really is, and sincerelysupports it for what it really is.The ostensible supporters of the Constitution, like the ostensible supporters ofmost other governments, are made up of three classes, viz.: 1. Knaves, anumerous and active class, who see in the government an instrument which theycan use for their own aggrandizement or wealth. 2. Dupes—a large class, nodoubt—each of whom, because he is allowed one voice out of millions in decidingwhat he may do with his own person and his own property, and because he ispermitted to have the same voice in robbing, enslaving, and murdering others,that others have in robbing, enslaving, and murdering himself, is stupid enoughto imagine that he is a “free man,” a “sovereign”; that this is “a freegovernment”; “a government of equal rights,” “the best government on earth,”[b]and such like absurdities. 3. A class who have some appreciation of the evils ofgovernment, but either do not see how to get rid of them, or do not choose to sofar sacrifice their private interests as to give themselves seriously andearnestly to the work of making a change.III.The payment of taxes, being compulsory, of course furnishes no evidence that anyone voluntarily supports the Constitution.1. It is true that the theory of our Constitution is, that all taxes are paidvoluntarily; that our government is a mutual insurance company, voluntarilyentered into by the people with each other; that each man makes a free andpurely voluntary contract with all others who are parties to the Constitution,to pay so much money for so much protection, the same as he does with any otherinsurance company; and that he is just as free not to be protected, and not topay tax, as he is to pay a tax, and be protected.But this theory of our government is wholly different from the practical fact.The fact is that the government, like a highwayman, says to a man: “Your money,or your life.” And many, if not most, taxes are paid under the compulsion ofthat threat.The government does not, indeed, waylay a man in a lonely place, spring upon himfrom the roadside, and, holding a pistol to his head, proceed to rifle hispockets. But the robbery is none the less a robbery on that account; and it isfar more dastardly and shameful.The highwayman takes solely upon himself the responsibility, danger, and crimeof his own act. He does not pretend that he has any rightful claim to yourmoney, or that he intends to use it for your own benefit. He does not pretend tobe anything but a robber. He has not acquired impudence enough to profess to bemerely a “protector,” and that he takes men’s money against their will, merelyto enable him to “protect” those infatuated travellers, who feel perfectly ableto protect themselves, or do not appreciate his peculiar system of protection.He is too sensible a man to make such professions as these. Furthermore, havingtaken your money, he leaves you, as you wish him to do. He does not persist infollowing you on the road, against your will; assuming to be your rightful“sovereign,” on account of the “protection” he affords you. He does not keep“protecting” you, by commanding you to bow down and serve him; by requiring youto do this, and forbidding you to do that; by robbing you of more money as oftenas he finds it for his interest or pleasure to do so; and by branding you as arebel, a traitor, and an enemy to your country, and shooting you down withoutmercy, if you dispute his authority, or resist his demands. He is too much of agentleman to be guilty of such impostures, and insults, and villainies as these.In short, he does not, in addition to robbing you, attempt to make you eitherhis dupe or his slave.The proceedings of those robbers and murderers, who call themselves “thegovernment,” are directly the opposite of these of the single highwayman.In the first place, they do not, like him, make themselves individually known;or, consequently, take upon themselves personally the responsibility of theiracts. On the contrary, they secretly (by secret ballot) designate some one oftheir number to commit the robbery in their behalf, while they keep themselvespractically concealed. They say to the person thus designated:Go to A................. B................, and say to him that “the government”has need of money to meet the expenses of protecting him and his property. If hepresumes to say that he has never contracted with us to protect him, and that hewants none of our protection, say to him that that is our business, and not his;that we choose to protect him, whether he desires us to do so or not; and thatwe demand pay, too, for protecting him. If he dares to inquire who theindividuals are, who have thus taken upon themselves the title of “thegovernment,” and who assume to protect him, and demand payment of him, withouthis having ever made any contract with them, say to him that that, too, is ourbusiness, and not his; that we do not choose to make ourselves individuallyknown to him; that we have secretly (by secret ballot) appointed you our agentto give him notice of our demands, and, if he complies with them, to give him,in our name, a receipt that will protect him against any similar demand for thepresent year. If he refuses to comply, seize and sell enough of his property topay not only our demands, but all your own expenses and trouble beside. If heresists the seizure of his property, call upon the bystanders to help you(doubtless some of them will prove to be members of our band). If, in defendinghis property, he should kill any of our band who are assisting you, capture himat all hazards; charge him (in one of our courts) with murder; convict him, andhang him. If he should call upon his neighbors, or any others who, like him, maybe disposed to resist our demands, and they should come in large numbers to hisassistance, cry out that they are all rebels and traitors; that “our country” isin danger; call upon the commander of our hired murderers; tell him to quell therebellion and “save the country,” cost what it may. Tell him to kill all whoresist, though they should be hundreds of thousands; and thus strike terror intoall others similarly disposed. See that the work of murder is thoroughly done;that we may have no further trouble of this kind hereafter. When these traitorsshall have thus been taught our strength and our determination, they will begood loyal citizens for many years, and pay their taxes without a why or awherefore.It is under such compulsion as this that taxes, so called, are paid. And howmuch proof the payment of taxes affords, that the people consent to support “thegovernment,” it needs no further argument to show.2. Still another reason why the payment of taxes implies no consent, or pledge,to support the government, is that the taxpayer does not know, and has no meansof knowing, who the particular individuals are who compose “the government.” Tohim “the government” is a myth, an abstraction, an incorporeality, with which hecan make no contract, and to which he can give no consent, and make no pledge.He knows it only through its pretended agents. “The government” itself he neversees. He knows indeed, by common report, that certain persons, of a certain age,are permitted to vote; and thus to make themselves parts of, or (if they choose)opponents of, the government, for the time being. But who of them do thus vote,and especially how each one votes (whether so as to aid or oppose thegovernment), he does not know; the voting being all done secretly (by secretballot). Who, therefore, practically compose “the government,” for the timebeing, he has no means of knowing. Of course he can make no contract with them,give them no consent, and make them no pledge. Of necessity, therefore, hispaying taxes to them implies, on his part, no contract, consent, or pledge tosupport them—that is, to support “the government,” or the Constitution.3. Not knowing who the particular individuals are, who call themselves “thegovernment,” the taxpayer does not know whom he pays his taxes to. All he knowsis that a man comes to him, representing himself to be the agent of “thegovernment”—that is, the agent of a secret band of robbers and murderers, whohave taken to themselves the title of “the government,” and have determined tokill everybody who refuses to give them whatever money they demand. To save hislife, he gives up his money to this agent. But as this agent does not make hisprincipals individually known to the taxpayer, the latter, after he has given uphis money, knows no more who are “the government”—that is, who were therobbers—than he did before. To say, therefore, that by giving up his money totheir agent, he entered into a voluntary contract with them, that he pledgeshimself to obey them, to support them, and to give them whatever money theyshould demand of him in the future, is simply ridiculous.4. All political power, as it is called, rests practically upon this matter ofmoney. Any number of scoundrels, having money enough to start with, canestablish themselves as a “government”; because, with money, they can hiresoldiers, and with soldiers extort more money; and also compel general obedienceto their will. It is with government, as Cæsar said it was in war, that moneyand soldiers mutually supported each other; that with money he could hiresoldiers, and with soldiers extort money. So these villains, who call themselvesgovernments, well understand that their power rests primarily upon money. Withmoney they can hire soldiers, and with soldiers extort money. And, when theirauthority is denied, the first use they always make of money, is to hiresoldiers to kill or subdue all who refuse them more money.For this reason, whoever desires liberty, should understand these vital facts,viz.: 1. That every man who puts money into the hands of a “government” (socalled), puts into its hands a sword which will be used against himself, toextort more money from him, and also to keep him in subjection to its arbitrarywill. 2. That those who will take his money, without his consent, in the firstplace, will use it for his further robbery and enslavement, if he presumes toresist their demands in the future. 3. That it is a perfect absurdity to supposethat any body of men would ever take a man’s money without his consent, for anysuch object as they profess to take it for, viz., that of protecting him; forwhy should they wish to protect him, if he does not wish them to do so? Tosuppose that they would do so, is just as absurd as it would be to suppose thatthey would take his money without his consent, for the purpose of buying food orclothing for him, when he did not want it. 4. If a man wants “protection,” he iscompetent to make his own bargains for it; and nobody has any occasion to robhim, in order to “protect” him against his will. 5. That the only security mencan have for their political liberty, consists in their keeping their money intheir own pockets, until they have assurances, perfectly satisfactory tothemselves, that it will be used as they wish it to be used, for their benefit,and not for their injury. 6. That no government, so called, can reasonably betrusted for a moment, or reasonably be supposed to have honest purposes in view,any longer than it depends wholly upon voluntary support.These facts are all so vital and so self-evident, that it cannot reasonably besupposed that any one will voluntarily pay money to a “government,” for thepurpose of securing its protection, unless he first makes an explicit and purelyvoluntary contract with it for that purpose.It is perfectly evident, therefore, that neither such voting, nor such paymentof taxes, as actually takes place, proves anybody’s consent, or obligation, tosupport the Constitution. Consequently we have no evidence at all that theConstitution is binding upon anybody, or that anybody is under any contract orobligation whatever to support it. And nobody is under any obligation to supportit.IV.The Constitution not only hinds nobody now, but it never did bind anybody. Itnever bound anybody, because it was never agreed to by anybody in such a manneras to make it, on general principles of law and reason, binding upon him.It is a general principle of law and reason, that a written instrument binds noone until he has signed it. This principle is so inflexible a one, that eventhough a man is unable to write his name, he must still “make his mark,” beforehe is bound by a written contract. This custom was established ages ago, whenfew men could write their names; when a clerk—that is, a man who could write—wasso rare and valuable a person, that even if he were guilty of high crimes, hewas entitled to pardon, on the ground that the public could not afford to losehis services. Even at that time, a written contract must be signed; and men whocould not write, either “made their mark,” or signed their contracts by stampingtheir seals upon wax affixed to the parchment on which their contracts werewritten. Hence the custom of affixing seals, that has continued to this time.The law holds, and reason declares, that if a written instrument is not signed,the presumption must be that the party to be bound by it, did not choose to signit, or to bind himself by it. And law and reason both give him until the lastmoment, in which to decide whether he will sign it, or not. Neither law norreason requires or expects a man to agree to an instrument, until it is written;for until it is written, he cannot know its precise legal meaning. And when itis written, and he has had the opportunity to satisfy himself of its preciselegal meaning, he is then expected to decide, and not before, whether he willagree to it or not. And if he do not then sign it, his reason is supposed to be,that he does not choose to enter into such a contract. The fact that theinstrument was written for him to sign, or with the hope that he would sign it,goes for nothing.Where would be the end of fraud and litigation, if one party could bring intocourt a written instrument, without any signature, and claim to have itenforced, upon the ground that it was written for another man to sign? that thisother man had promised to sign it? that he ought to have signed it? that he hadhad the opportunity to sign it, if he would? but that he had refused orneglected to do so? Yet that is the most that could ever be said of theConstitution.[c] The very judges, who profess to derive all their authority fromthe Constitution—from an instrument that nobody ever signed—would spurn anyother instrument, not signed, that should be brought before them foradjudication.Moreover, a written instrument must, in law and reason, not only be signed, butmust also be delivered to the party (or to some one for him), in whose favor itis made, before it can bind the party making it. The signing is of no effect,unless the instrument be also delivered. And a party is at perfect liberty torefuse to deliver a written instrument, after he has signed it. He is as free torefuse to deliver it, as he is to refuse to sign it. The Constitution was notonly never signed by anybody, but it was never delivered by anybody, or toanybody’s agent or attorney. It can therefore be of no more validity as acontract, than can any other instrument, that was never signed or delivered.V.As further evidence of the general sense of mankind, as to the practicalnecessity there is that all men’s important contracts, especially those of apermanent nature, should be both written and signed, the following facts arepertinent.For nearly two hundred years—that is, since 1677—there has been on the statutebook of England, and the same, in substance, if not precisely in letter, hasbeen re-enacted, and is now in force, in nearly or quite all the States of thisUnion, a statute, the general object of which is to declare that no action shallbe brought to enforce contracts of the more important class, unless they are putin writing, and signed by the parties to be held chargeable upon them.[d]The principle of the statute, be it observed, is, not merely that writtencontracts shall be signed, but also that all contracts, except those speciallyexempted—generally those that are for small amounts, and are to remain in forcebut for a short time—shall be both written and signed.The reason of the statute, on this point, is, that it is now so easy a thing formen to put their contracts in writing, and sign them, and their failure to do soopens the door to so much doubt, fraud, and litigation, that men who neglect tohave their contracts—of any considerable importance—written and signed, oughtnot to have the benefit of courts of justice to enforce them. And this reason isa wise one; and that experience has confirmed its wisdom and necessity, isdemonstrated by the fact that it has been acted upon in England for nearly twohundred years, and has been so nearly universally adopted in this country, andthat nobody thinks of repealing it.We all know, too, how careful most men are to have their contracts written andsigned, even when this statute does not require it. For example, most men, ifthey have money due them, of no larger amount than five or ten dollars, arecareful to take a note for it. If they buy even a small bill of goods, payingfor it at the time of delivery, they take a receipted bill for it. If they pay asmall balance of a book account, or any other small debt previously contracted,they take a written receipt for it.Furthermore, the law everywhere (probably) in our country, as well as inEngland, requires that a large class of contracts, such as wills, deeds, etc.,shall not only be written and signed, but also sealed, witnessed, andacknowledged. And in the case of married women conveying their rights in realestate, the law, in many States, requires that the women shall be examinedseparate and apart from their husbands, and declare that they sign theircontracts free of any fear or compulsion of their husbands.Such are some of the precautions which the laws require, and whichindividuals—from motives of common prudence, even in cases not required bylaw—take, to put their contracts in writing, and have them signed, and, to guardagainst all uncertainties and controversies in regard to their meaning andvalidity. And yet we have what purports, or professes, or is claimed, to be acontract—the Constitution—made eighty years ago, by men who are now all dead,and who never had any power to bind us, but which (it is claimed) hasnevertheless bound three generations of men, consisting of many millions, andwhich (it is claimed) will be binding upon all the millions that are to come;but which nobody ever signed, sealed, delivered, witnessed, or acknowledged; andwhich few persons, compared with the whole number that are claimed to be boundby it, have ever read, or even seen, or ever will read, or see. And of those whoever have read it, or ever will read it, scarcely any two, perhaps no two, haveever agreed, or ever will agree, as to what it means.Moreover, this supposed contract, which would not be received in any court ofjustice sitting under its authority, if offered to prove a debt of five dollars,owing by one man to another, is one by which—as it is generally interpreted bythose who pretend to administer it—all men, women and children throughout thecountry, and through all time, surrender not only all their property, but alsotheir liberties, and even lives, into the hands of men who by this supposedcontract, are expressly made wholly irresponsible for their disposal of them.And we are so insane, or so wicked, as to destroy property and lives withoutlimit, in fighting to compel men to fulfill a supposed contract, which, inasmuchas it has never been signed by anybody, is, on general principles of law andreason—such principles as we are all governed by in regard to othercontracts—the merest waste paper, binding upon nobody, fit only to be throwninto the fire; or, if preserved, preserved only to serve as a witness and awarning of the folly and wickedness of mankind.VI.It is no exaggeration, but a literal truth, to say that, by the Constitution—notas I interpret it, but as it is interpreted by those who pretend to administerit—the properties, liberties, and lives of the entire people of the UnitedStates are surrendered unreservedly into the hands of men who, it is provided bythe Constitution itself, shall never be “questioned” as to any disposal theymake of them.Thus the Constitution (Art. I, Sec. 6) provides that, “for any speech or debate(or vote), in either house, they (the senators and representatives) shall not bequestioned in any other place.”The whole law-making power is given to these senators and representatives (whenacting by a two-thirds vote)[e]; and this provision protects them from allresponsibility for the laws they make.The Constitution also enables them to secure the execution of all their laws, bygiving them power to withhold the salaries of, and to impeach and remove, alljudicial and executive officers, who refuse to execute them.Thus the whole power of the government is in their hands, and they are madeutterly irresponsible for the use they make of it. What is this but absolute,irresponsible power?It is no answer to this view of the case to say that these men are under oath touse their power only within certain limits; for what care they, or what shouldthey care, for oaths or limits, when it is expressly provided, by theConstitution itself, that they shall never be “questioned,” or held to anyresponsibility whatever, for violating their oaths, or transgressing thoselimits?Neither is it any answer to this view of the case to say that the particularindividuals holding this power can be changed once in two or six years; for thepower of each set of men is absolute during the term for which they hold it; andwhen they can hold it no longer, they are succeeded only by men whose power willbe equally absolute and irresponsible.Neither is it any answer to this view of the case to say that the men holdingthis absolute, irresponsible power, must be men chosen by the people (orportions of them) to hold it. A man is none the less a slave because he isallowed to choose a new master once in a term of years. Neither are a people anythe less slaves because permitted periodically to choose new masters. What makesthem slaves is the fact that they now are, and are always hereafter to be, inthe hands of men whose power over them is, and always is to be, absolute andirresponsible.[f]The right of absolute and irresponsible dominion is the right of property, andthe right of property is the right of absolute, irresponsible dominion. The twoare identical; the one necessarily implying the other. Neither can exist withoutthe other. If, therefore, Congress have that absolute and irresponsiblelaw-making power, which the Constitution—according to their interpretation ofit—gives them, it can only be because they own us as property. If they own us asproperty, they are our masters, and their will is our law. If they do not own usas property, they are not our masters, and their will, as such, is of noauthority over us.But these men who claim and exercise this absolute and irresponsible dominionover us, dare not be consistent, and claim either to be our masters, or to ownus as property. They say they are only our servants, agents, attorneys, andrepresentatives. But this declaration involves an absurdity, a contradiction. Noman can be my servant, agent, attorney, or representative, and be, at the sametime, uncontrollable by me, and irresponsible to me for his acts. It is of noimportance that I appointed him, and put all power in his hands. If I made himuncontrollable by me, and irresponsible to me, he is no longer my servant,agent, attorney, or representative. If I gave him absolute, irresponsible powerover my property, I gave him the property. If I gave him absolute, irresponsiblepower over myself, I made him my master, and gave myself to him as a slave. Andit is of no importance whether I called him master or servant, agent or owner.The only question is, what power did I put into his hands? Was it an absoluteand irresponsible one? or a limited and responsible one?For still another reason they are neither our servants, agents, attorneys, norrepresentatives. And that reason is, that we do not make ourselves responsiblefor their acts. If a man is my servant, agent, or attorney, I necessarily makemyself responsible for all his acts done within the limits of the power I haveintrusted to him. If I have intrusted him, as my agent, with either absolutepower, or any power at all, over the persons or properties of other men thanmyself, I thereby necessarily make myself responsible to those other persons forany injuries he may do them, so long as he acts within the limits of the power Ihave granted him. But no individual who may be injured in his person orproperty, by acts of Congress, can come to the individual electors, and holdthem responsible for these acts of their so-called agents or representatives.This fact proves that these pretended agents of the people, of everybody, arereally the agents of nobody.If, then, nobody is individually responsible for the acts of Congress, themembers of Congress are nobody’s agents. And if they are nobody’s agents, theyare themselves individually responsible for their own acts, and for the acts ofall whom they employ. And the authority they are exercising is simply their ownindividual authority; and, by the law of nature—the highest of all laws—anybodyinjured by their acts, anybody who is deprived by them of his property or hisliberty, has the same right to hold them individually responsible, that he hasto hold any other trespasser individually responsible. He has the same right toresist them, and their agents, that he has to resist any other trespassers.VII.It is plain, then, that on general principles of law and reason-such principlesas we all act upon in courts of justice and in common life—the Constitution isno contract; that it binds nobody, and never did bind anybody; and that allthose who pretend to act by its authority, are really acting without anylegitimate authority at all; that, on general principles of law and reason, theyare mere usurpers, and that everybody not only has the right, but is morallybound, to treat them as such.If the people of this country wish to maintain such a government as theConstitution describes, there is no reason in the world why they should not signthe instrument itself, and thus make known their wishes in an open, authenticmanner; in such manner as the common sense and experience of mankind have shownto be reasonable and necessary in such cases; and in such manner as to makethemselves (as they ought to do) individually responsible for the acts of thegovernment. But the people have never been asked to sign it. And the only reasonwhy they have never been asked to sign it, has been that it has been known thatthey never would sign it; that they were neither such fools nor knaves as theymust needs have been to be willing to sign it; that (at least as it has beenpractically interpreted) it is not what any sensible and honest man wants forhimself; nor such as he has any right to impose upon others. It is, to all moralintents and purposes, as destitute of obligation as the compacts which robbersand thieves and pirates enter into with each other, but never sign.If any considerable number of the people believe the Constitution to be good,why do they not sign it themselves, and make laws for, and administer them upon,each other; leaving all other persons (who do not interfere with them) in peace?Until they have tried the experiment for themselves, how can they have the faceto impose the Constitution upon, or even to recommend it to, others? Plainly thereason for such absurd and inconsistent conduct is that they want theConstitution, not solely for any honest or legitimate use it can be of tothemselves or others, but for the dishonest and illegitimate power it gives themover the persons and properties of others. But for this latter reason, all theireulogiums on the Constitution, all their exhortations, and all theirexpenditures of money and blood to sustain it, would be wanting.VIII.The Constitution itself, then, being of no authority, on what authority does ourgovernment practically rest? On what ground can those who pretend to administerit, claim the right to seize men’s property, to restrain them of their naturalliberty of action, industry, and trade, and to kill all who deny their authorityto dispose of men’s properties, liberties, and lives at their pleasure ordiscretion?The most they can say, in answer to this question, is, that some half,two-thirds, or three-fourths, of the male adults of the country have a tacitunderstanding that they will maintain a government under the Constitution; thatthey will select, by ballot, the persons to administer it; and that thosepersons who may receive a majority, or a plurality, of their ballots, shall actas their representatives, and administer the Constitution in their name, and bytheir authority.But this tacit understanding (admitting it to exist) cannot at all justify theconclusion drawn from it. A tacit understanding between A, B, and C, that theywill, by ballot, depute D as their agent, to deprive me of my property, liberty,or life, cannot at all authorize D to do so. He is none the less a robber,tyrant, and murderer, because he claims to act as their agent, than he would beif he avowedly acted on his own responsibility alone.Neither am I bound to recognize him as their agent, nor can he legitimatelyclaim to be their agent, when he brings no written authority from themaccrediting him as such. I am under no obligation to take his word as to who hisprincipals may be, or whether he has any. Bringing no credentials, I have aright to say he has no such authority even as he claims to have: and that he istherefore intending to rob, enslave, or murder me on his own account.This tacit understanding, therefore, among the voters of the country, amounts tonothing as an authority to their agents. Neither do the ballots by which theyselect their agents, avail any more than does their tacit understanding; fortheir ballots are given in secret, and therefore in a way to avoid any personalresponsibility for the acts of their agents.No body of men can be said to authorize a man to act as their agent, to theinjury of a third person, unless they do it in so open and authentic a manner asto make themselves personally responsible for his acts. None of the voters inthis country appoint their political agents in any open, authentic manner, or inany manner to make themselves responsible for their acts. Therefore thesepretended agents cannot legitimately claim to be really agents. Somebody must beresponsible for the acts of these pretended agents; and if they cannot show anyopen and authentic credentials from their principals, they cannot, in law orreason, be said to have any principals. The maxim applies here, that what doesnot appear, does not exist. If they can show no principals, they have none.But even these pretended agents do not themselves know who their pretendedprincipals are. These latter act in secret; for acting by secret ballot isacting in secret as much as if they were to meet in secret conclave in thedarkness of the night. And they are personally as much unknown to the agentsthey select, as they are to others. No pretended agent therefore can ever knowby whose ballots he is selected, or consequently who his real principals are.Not knowing who his principals are, he has no right to say that he has any. Hecan, at most, say only that he is the agent of a secret band of robbers andmurderers, who are bound by that faith which prevails among confederates incrime, to stand by him, if his acts, done in their name, shall be resisted.Men honestly engaged in attempting to establish justice in the world, have nooccasion thus to act in secret; or to appoint agents to do acts for which they(the principals) are not willing to be responsible.The secret ballot makes a secret government; and a secret government is a secretband of robbers and murderers. Open despotism is better than this. The singledespot stands out in the face of all men, and says: I am the State: My will islaw: I am your master: I take the responsibility of my acts: The only arbiter Iacknowledge is the sword: If any one denies my right, let him try conclusionswith me.But a secret government is little less than a government of assassins. Under it,a man knows not who his tyrants are, until they have struck, and perhaps notthen. He may guess, beforehand, as to some of his immediate neighbors. But hereally knows nothing. The man to whom he would most naturally fly forprotection, may prove an enemy, when the time of trial comes.This is the kind of government we have; and it is the only one we are likely tohave, until men are ready to say: We will consent to no Constitution, exceptsuch an one as we are neither ashamed nor afraid to sign; and we will authorizeno government to do anything in our name which we are not willing to bepersonally responsible for.IX.What is the motive to the secret ballot? This, and only this: Like otherconfederates in crime, those who use it are not friends, but enemies; and theyare afraid to be known, and to have their individual doings known, even to eachother. They can contrive to bring about a sufficient understanding to enablethem to act in concert against other persons; but beyond this they have noconfidence, and no friendship, among themselves. In fact, they are engaged quiteas much in schemes for plundering each other, as in plundering those who are notof them. And it is perfectly well understood among them that the strongest partyamong them will, in certain contingencies, murder each other by the hundreds ofthousands (as they lately did do) to accomplish their purposes against eachother. Hence they dare not be known, and have their individual doings known,even to each other. And this is avowedly the only reason for the ballot: for asecret government; a government by secret bands of robbers and murderers. And weare insane enough to call this liberty! To be a member of this secret band ofrobbers and murderers is esteemed a privilege and an honor! Without thisprivilege, a man is considered a slave; but with it a free man! With it he isconsidered a free man, because he has the same power to secretly (by secretballot) procure the robbery, enslavement, and murder of another man, and thatother man has to procure his robbery, enslavement, and murder. And this theycall equal rights!If any number of men, many or few, claim the right to govern the people of thiscountry, let them make and sign an open compact with each other to do so. Letthem thus make themselves individually known to those whom they propose togovern. And let them thus openly take the legitimate responsibility of theiracts. How many of those who now support the Constitution, will ever do this? Howmany will ever dare openly proclaim their right to govern? or take thelegitimate responsibility of their acts? Not one!X.It is obvious that, on general principles of law and reason, there exists nosuch thing as a government created by, or resting upon, any consent, compact, oragreement of “the people of the United States” with each other; that the onlyvisible, tangible, responsible government that exists, is that of a fewindividuals only, who act in concert, and call themselves by the several namesof senators, representatives, presidents, judges, marshals, treasurers,collectors, generals, colonels, captains, etc., etc.On general principles of law and reason, it is of no importance whatever thatthose few individuals profess to be the agents and representatives of “thepeople of the United States”; since they can show no credentials from the peoplethemselves; they were never appointed as agents or representatives in any open,authentic manner; they do not themselves know, and have no means of knowing, andcannot prove, who their principals (as they call them) are individually; andconsequently cannot, in law or reason, be said to have any principals at all.It is obvious, too, that if these alleged principals ever did appoint thesepretended agents, or representatives, they appointed them secretly (by secretballot), and in a way to avoid all personal responsibility for their acts; that,at most, these alleged principals put these pretended agents forward for themost criminal purposes, viz.: to plunder the people of their property, andrestrain them of their liberty; and that the only authority that these allegedprincipals have for so doing, is simply a tacit understanding among themselvesthat they will imprison, shoot, or hang every man who resists the exactions andrestraints which their agents or representatives may impose upon them.Thus it is obvious that the only visible, tangible government we have is made upof these professed agents or representatives of a secret band of robbers andmurderers, who, to cover up, or gloss over, their robberies and murders, havetaken to themselves the title of “the people of the United States”; and who, onthe pretense of being “the people of the United States,” assert their right tosubject to their dominion, and to control and dispose of at their pleasure, allproperty and persons found in the United States.XI.On general principles of law and reason, the oaths which these pretended agentsof the people take “to support the Constitution,” are of no validity orobligation. And why? For this, if for no other reason, viz., that they are givento nobody. There is no privity (as the lawyers say)—that is, no mutualrecognition, consent, and agreement—between those who take these oaths, and anyother persons.If I go upon Boston Common, and in the presence of a hundred thousand people,men, women and children, with whom I have no contract on the subject, take anoath that I will enforce upon them the laws of Moses, of Lycurgus, of Solon, ofJustinian, or of Alfred, that oath is, on general principles of law and reason,of no obligation. It is of no obligation, not merely because it is intrinsicallya criminal one, but also because it is given to nobody, and consequently pledgesmy faith to nobody. It is merely given to the winds.It would not alter the case at all to say that, among these hundred thousandpersons, in whose presence the oath was taken, there were two, three, or fivethousand male adults, who had secretly—by secret ballot, and in a way to avoidmaking themselves individually known to me, or to the remainder of the hundredthousand-designated me as their agent to rule, control, plunder, and, if needbe, murder, these hundred thousand people. The fact that they had designated mesecretly, and in a manner to prevent my knowing them individually, prevents allprivity between them and me; and consequently makes it impossible that there canbe any contract, or pledge of faith, on my part towards them; for it isimpossible that I can pledge my faith, in any legal sense, to a man whom Ineither know, nor have any means of knowing, individually.So far as I am concerned, then, these two, three, or five thousand persons are asecret band of robbers and murderers, who have secretly, and in a way to savethemselves from all responsibility for my acts, designated me as their agent;and have, through some other agent, or pretended agent, made their wishes knownto me. But being, nevertheless, individually unknown to me, and having no open,authentic contract with me, my oath is, on general principles of law and reason,of no validity as a pledge of faith to them. And being no pledge of faith tothem, it is no pledge of faith to anybody. It is mere idle wind. At most, it isonly a pledge of faith to an unknown band of robbers and murderers, whoseinstrument for plundering and murdering other people, I thus publicly confessmyself to be. And it has no other obligation than a similar oath given to anyother unknown body of pirates, robbers, and murderers.For these reasons the oaths taken by members of Congress, “to support theConstitution,” are, on general principles of law and reason, of no validity.They are not only criminal in themselves, and therefore void; but they are alsovoid for the further reason that they are given to nobody.It cannot be said that, in any legitimate or legal sense, they are given to “thepeople of the United States”; because neither the whole, nor any largeproportion of the whole, people of the United States ever, either openly orsecretly, appointed or designated these men as their agents to carry theConstitution into effect. The great body of the people—that is, men, women andchildren—were never asked, or even permitted, to signify, in any formal manner,either openly or secretly, their choice or wish on the subject. The most thatthese members of Congress can say, in favor of their appointment, is simplythis: Each one can say for himself:I have evidence satisfactory to myself, that there exists, scattered throughoutthe country, a band of men, having a tacit understanding with each other, andcalling themselves “the people of the United States,” whose general purposes areto control and plunder each other, and all other persons in the country, and, sofar as they can, even in neighboring countries; and to kill every man who shallattempt to defend his person and property against their schemes of plunder anddominion. Who these men are, individually, I have no certain means of knowing,for they sign no papers, and give no open, authentic evidence of theirindividual membership. They are not known individually even to each other. Theyare apparently as much afraid of being individually known to each other, as ofbeing known to other persons. Hence they ordinarily have no mode either ofexercising, or of making known, their individual membership, otherwise than bygiving their votes secretly for certain agents to do their will. But althoughthese men are individually unknown, both to each other and to other persons, itis generally understood in the country that none but male persons, of the age oftwenty-one years and upwards, can be members. It is also generally understoodthat all male persons, born in the country, having certain complexions, and (insome localities) certain amounts of property, and (in certain cases) evenpersons of foreign birth, are permitted to be members. But it appears thatusually not more than one half, two-thirds, or, in some cases, three-fourths, ofall who are thus permitted to become members of the band, ever exercise, orconsequently prove, their actual membership, in the only mode in which theyordinarily can exercise or prove it, viz., by giving their votes secretly forthe officers or agents of the band. The number of these secret votes, so far aswe have any account of them, varies greatly from year to year, thus tending toprove that the band, instead of being a permanent organization, is a merely protempore affair with those who choose to act with it for the time being. Thegross number of these secret votes, or what purports to be their gross number,in different localities, is occasionally published. Whether these reports areaccurate or not, we have no means of knowing. It is generally supposed thatgreat frauds are often committed in depositing them. They are understood to bereceived and counted by certain men, who are themselves appointed for thatpurpose by the same secret process by which all other officers and agents of theband are selected. According to the reports of these receivers of votes (forwhose accuracy or honesty, however, I cannot vouch), and according to my bestknowledge of the whole number of male persons “in my district,” who (it issupposed) were permitted to vote, it would appear that one-half, two-thirds orthree-fourths actually did vote. Who the men were, individually, who cast thesevotes, I have no knowledge, for the whole thing was done secretly. But of thesecret votes thus given for what they call a “member of Congress,” the receiversreported that I had a majority, or at least a larger number than any other oneperson. And it is only by virtue of such a designation that I am now here to actin concert with other persons similarly selected in other parts of the country.It is understood among those who sent me here, that all the persons so selected,will, on coming together at the City of Washington, take an oath in each other’spresence “to support the Constitution of the United States.” By this is meant acertain paper that was drawn up eighty years ago. It was never signed byanybody, and apparently has no obligation, and never had any obligation, as acontract. In fact, few persons ever read it, and doubtless much the largestnumber of those who voted for me and the others, never even saw it, or nowpretend to know what it means. Nevertheless, it is often spoken of in thecountry as “the Constitution of the United States”; and for some reason oranother, the men who sent me here, seem to expect that I, and all with whom Iact, will swear to carry this Constitution into effect. I am therefore ready totake this oath, and to co-operate with all others, similarly selected, who areready to take the same oath.This is the most that any member of Congress can say in proof that he has anyconstituency; that he represents anybody; that his oath “to support theConstitution,” is given to anybody, or pledges his faith to anybody. He has noopen, written, or other authentic evidence, such as is required in all othercases, that he was ever appointed the agent or representative of anybody. He hasno written power of attorney from any single individual. He has no such legalknowledge as is required in all other cases, by which he can identify a singleone of those who pretend to have appointed him to represent them.Of course his oath, professedly given to them, “to support the Constitution,”is, on general principles of law and reason, an oath given to nobody. It pledgeshis faith to nobody. If he fails to fulfil his oath, not a single person cancome forward, and say to him, you have betrayed me, or broken faith with me.No one can come forward and say to him: I appointed you my attorney to act forme. I required you to swear that, as my attorney, you would support theConstitution. You promised me that you would do so; and now you have forfeitedthe oath you gave to me. No single individual can say this.No open, avowed, or responsible association, or body of men, can come forwardand say to him: We appointed you our attorney, to act for us. We required you toswear that, as our attorney, you would support the Constitution. You promised usthat you would do so; and now you have forfeited the oath you gave to us.No open, avowed, or responsible association, or body of men, can say this tohim; because there is no such association or body of men in existence. If anyone should assert that there is such an association, let him prove, if he can,who compose it. Let him produce, if he can, any open, written, or otherauthentic contract, signed or agreed to by these men; forming themselves into anassociation; making themselves known as such to the world; appointing him astheir agent; and making themselves individually, or as an association,responsible for his acts, done by their authority. Until all this can be shown,no one can say that, in any legitimate sense, there is any such association; orthat he is their agent; or that he ever gave his oath to them; or ever pledgedhis faith to them.On general principles of law and reason, it would be a sufficient answer for himto say, to all individuals, and all pretended associations of individuals, whoshould accuse him of a breach of faith to them:I never knew you. Where is your evidence that you, either individually orcollectively, ever appointed me your attorney? that you ever required me toswear to you, that, as your attorney, I would support the Constitution? or thatI have now broken any faith I ever pledged to you? You may, or you may not, bemembers of that secret band of robbers and murderers, who act in secret; appointtheir agents by a secret ballot; who keep themselves individually unknown evento the agents they thus appoint; and who, therefore, cannot claim that they haveany agents; or that any of their pretended agents ever gave his oath, or pledgedhis faith, to them. I repudiate you altogether. My oath was given to others,with whom you have nothing to do; or it was idle wind, given only to the idlewinds. Begone!XII.For the same reasons, the oaths of all the other pretended agents of this secretband of robbers and murderers are, on general principles of law and reason,equally destitute of obligation. They are given to nobody; but only to thewinds.The oaths of the tax-gatherers and treasurers of the band, are, on generalprinciples of law and reason, of no validity. If any tax gatherer, for example,should put the money he receives into his own pocket, and refuse to part withit, the members of this band could not say to him: You collected that money asour agent, and for our uses; and you swore to pay it over to us, or to those weshould appoint to receive it. You have betrayed us, and broken faith with us.It would be a sufficient answer for him to say to them:I never knew you. You never made yourselves individually known to me. I nevergave my oath to you, as individuals. You may, or you may not, be members of thatsecret band, who appoint agents to rob and murder other people; but who arecautious not to make themselves individually known, either to such agents, or tothose whom their agents are commissioned to rob. If you are members of thatband, you have given me no proof that you ever commissioned me to rob others foryour benefit. I never knew you, as individuals, and of course never promised youthat I would pay over to you the proceeds of my robberies. I committed myrobberies on my own account, and for my own profit. If you thought I was foolenough to allow you to keep yourselves concealed, and use me as your tool forrobbing other persons; or that I would take all the personal risk of therobberies, and pay over the proceeds to you, you were particularly simple. As Itook all the risk of my robberies, I propose to take all the profits. Begone!You are fools, as well as villains. If I gave my oath to anybody, I gave it toother persons than you. But I really gave it to nobody. I only gave it to thewinds. It answered my purposes at the time. It enabled me to get the money I wasafter, and now I propose to keep it. If you expected me to pay it over to you,you relied only upon that honor that is said to prevail among thieves. You nowunderstand that that is a very poor reliance. I trust you may become wise enoughto never rely upon it again. If I have any duty in the matter, it is to giveback the money to those from whom I took it; not to pay it over to such villainsas you.XIII.On general principles of law and reason, the oaths which foreigners take, oncoming here, and being ‘naturalized” (as it is called), are of no validity. Theyare necessarily given to nobody; because there is no open, authenticassociation, to which they can join themselves; or to whom, as individuals, theycan pledge their faith. No such association, or organization, as “the people ofthe United States,” having ever been formed by any open, written, authentic, orvoluntary contract, there is, on general principles of law and reason, no suchassociation, or organization, in existence. And all oaths that purport to begiven to such an association are necessarily given only to the winds. Theycannot be said to be given to any man, or body of men, as individuals, becauseno man, or body of men, can come forward with any proof that the oaths weregiven to them, as individuals, or to any association of which they are members.To say that there is a tacit understanding among a portion of the male adults ofthe country, that they will call themselves “the people of the United States,”and that they will act in concert in subjecting the remainder of the people ofthe United States to their dominion; but that they will keep themselvespersonally concealed by doing all their acts secretly, is wholly insufficient,on general principles of law and reason, to prove the existence of any suchassociation, or organization, as “the people of the United States”; orconsequently to prove that the oaths of foreigners were given to any suchassociation.XIV.On general principles of law and reason, all the oaths which, since the war,have been given by Southern men, that they will obey the laws of Congress,support the Union, and the like, are of no validity. Such oaths are invalid, notonly because they were extorted by military power, and threats of confiscation,and because they are in contravention of men’s natural right to do as theyplease about supporting the government, but also because they were given tonobody. They were nominally given to “the United States.” But being nominallygiven to “the United States,” they were necessarily given to nobody, because, ongeneral principles of law and reason, there were no “United States,” to whom theoaths could be given. That is to say, there was no open, authentic, avowed,legitimate association, corporation, or body of men, known as “the UnitedStates,” or as “the people of the United States,” to whom the oaths could havebeen given. If anybody says there was such a corporation, let him state who werethe individuals that composed it, and how and when they became a corporation.Were Mr. A, Mr. B, and Mr. C members of it? If so, where are their signatures?Where the evidence of their membership? Where the record? Where the open,authentic proof? There is none. Therefore, in law and reason, there was no suchcorporation.On general principles of law and reason, every corporation, association, ororganized body of men, having a legitimate corporate existence, and legitimatecorporate rights, must consist of certain known individuals, who can prove, bylegitimate and reasonable evidence, their membership. But nothing of this kindcan be proved in regard to the corporation, or body of men, who call themselves“the United States.” Not a man of them, in all the Northern States, can prove byany legitimate evidence, such as is required to prove membership in other legalcorporations, that he himself, or any other man whom he can name, is a member ofany corporation or association called “the United States,” or “the people of theUnited States,” or, consequently, that there is any such corporation. And sinceno such corporation can be proved to exist, it cannot of course be proved thatthe oaths of Southern men were given to any such corporation. The most that canbe claimed is that the oaths were given to a secret band of robbers andmurderers, who called themselves “the United States,” and extorted those oaths.But that certainly is not enough to prove that the oaths are of any obligation.XV.On general principles of law and reason, the oaths of soldiers, that they willserve a given number of years, that they will obey the orders of their superiorofficers, that they will bear true allegiance to the government, and so forth,are of no obligation. Independently of the criminality of an oath, that, for agiven number of years, he will kill all whom he may be commanded to kill,without exercising his own judgment or conscience as to the justice or necessityof such killing, there is this further reason why a soldier’s oath is of noobligation, viz., that, like all the other oaths that have now been mentioned,it is given to nobody. There being, in no legitimate sense, any suchcorporation, or nation, as “the United States,” nor, consequently, in anylegitimate sense, any such government as “the government of the United States,”a soldiers oath given to, or contract made with, such nation or government, isnecessarily an oath given to, or a contract made with, nobody. Consequently suchoath or contract can be of no obligation.XVI.On general principles of law and reason, the treaties, so called, which purportto be entered into with other nations, by persons calling themselvesambassadors, secretaries, presidents, and senators of the United States, in thename, and in behalf, of “the people of the United States,” are of no validity.These so-called ambassadors, secretaries, presidents, and senators, who claim tobe the agents of “the people of the United States,” for making these treaties,can show no open, written, or other authentic evidence that either the whole“people of the United States,” or any other open, avowed, responsible body ofmen, calling themselves by that name, ever authorized these pretendedambassadors and others to make treaties in the name of, or binding upon any oneof, “the people of the United States,” or any other open, avowed, responsiblebody of men, calling themselves by that name, ever authorized these pretendedambassadors, secretaries, and others, in their name and behalf, to recognizecertain other persons, calling themselves emperors, kings, queens, and the like,as the rightful rulers, sovereigns, masters, or representatives of the differentpeoples whom they assume to govern, to represent, and to bind.The “nations,” as they are called, with whom our pretended ambassadors,secretaries, presidents, and senators profess to make treaties, are as muchmyths as our own. On general principles of law and reason, there are no such“nations.” That is to say, neither the whole people of England, for example, norany open, avowed, responsible body of men, calling themselves by that name,ever, by any open, written, or other authentic contract with each other, formedthemselves into any bona fide, legitimate association or organization, orauthorized any king, queen, or other representative to make treaties in theirname, or to bind them, either individually, or as an association, by suchtreaties.Our pretended treaties, then, being made with no legitimate or bona fidenations, or representatives of nations, and being made, on our part, by personswho have no legitimate authority to act for us, have intrinsically no morevalidity than a pretended treaty made by the Man in the Moon with the king ofthe Pleiades.XVII.On general principles of law and reason, debts contracted in the name of “theUnited States,” or of “the people of the United States,” are of no validity. Itis utterly absurd to pretend that debts to the amount of twenty-five hundredmillions of dollars[5] are binding upon thirty-five or forty millions of people,when there is not a particle of legitimate evidence—such as would be required toprove a private debt—that can be produced against any one of them, that eitherhe, or his properly authorized attorney, ever contracted to pay one cent.Certainly, neither the whole people of the United States, nor any number ofthem, ever separately or individually contracted to pay a cent of these debts.Certainly, also, neither the whole people of the United States, nor any numberof them, ever, by any open, written, or other authentic and voluntary contract,united themselves as a firm, corporation, or association, by the name of “theUnited States,” or “the people of the United States,” and authorized theiragents to contract debts in their name.Certainly, too, there is in existence no such firm, corporation, or associationas “the United States,” or “the people of the United States,” formed by anyopen, written, or other authentic and voluntary contract, and having corporateproperty with which to pay these debts.How, then, is it possible, on any general principle of law or reason, that debtsthat are binding upon nobody individually, can be binding upon forty millions ofpeople collectively, when, on general and legitimate principles of law andreason, these forty millions of people neither have, nor ever had, any corporateproperty? never made any corporate or individual contract? and neither have, norever had, any corporate existence?Who, then, created these debts, in the name of “the United States”? Why, atmost, only a few persons, calling themselves “members of Congress,” etc., whopretended to represent “the people of the United States,” but who reallyrepresented only a secret band of robbers and murderers, who wanted money tocarry on the robberies and murders in which they were then engaged; and whointended to extort from the future people of the United States, by robbery andthreats of murder (and real murder, if that should prove necessary), the meansto pay these debts.This band of robbers and murderers, who were the real principals in contractingthese debts, is a secret one, because its members have never entered into anyopen, written, avowed, or authentic contract, by which they may be individuallyknown to the world, or even to each other. Their real or pretendedrepresentatives, who contracted these debts in their name, were selected (ifselected at all) for that purpose secretly (by secret ballot), and in a way tofurnish evidence against none of the principals individually; and theseprincipals were really known individually neither to their pretendedrepresentatives who contracted these debts in their behalf, nor to those wholent the money. The money, therefore, was all borrowed and lent in the dark;that is, by men who did not see each others faces, or know each other’s names;who could not then, and cannot now, identify each other as principals in thetransactions; and who consequently can prove no contract with each other.Furthermore, the money was all lent and borrowed for criminal purposes; that is,for purposes of robbery and murder; and for this reason the contracts were allintrinsically void; and would have been so, even though the real parties,borrowers and lenders, had come face to face, and made their contracts openly,in their own proper names.Furthermore, this secret band of robbers and murderers, who were the realborrowers of this money, having no legitimate corporate existence, have nocorporate property with which to pay these debts. They do indeed pretend to ownlarge tracts of wild lands, lying between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, andbetween the Gulf of Mexico and the North Pole. But, on general principles of lawand reason, they might as well pretend to own the Atlantic and Pacific Oceansthemselves; or the atmosphere and the sunlight; and to hold them, and dispose ofthem, for the payment of these debts.Having no corporate property with which to pay what purports to be theircorporate debts, this secret band of robbers and murderers are really bankrupt.They have nothing to pay with. In fact, they do not propose to pay their debtsotherwise than from the proceeds of their future robberies and murders. Theseare confessedly their sole reliance; and were known to be such by the lenders ofthe money, at the time the money was lent. And it was, therefore, virtually apart of the contract, that the money should be repaid only from the proceeds ofthese future robberies and murders. For this reason, if for no other, thecontracts were void from the beginning.In fact, these apparently two classes, borrowers and lenders, were really oneand the same class. They borrowed and lent money from and to themselves. Theythemselves were not only part and parcel, but the very life and soul, of thissecret band of robbers and murderers, who borrowed and spent the money.Individually they furnished money for a common enterprise; taking, in return,what purported to be corporate promises for individual loans. The only excusethey had for taking these so-called corporate promises of, for individual loansby, the same parties, was that they might have some apparent excuse for thefuture robberies of the band (that is, to pay the debts of the corporation), andthat they might also know what shares they were to be respectively entitled toout of the proceeds of their future robberies.Finally, if these debts had been created for the most innocent and honestpurposes, and in the most open and honest manner, by the real parties to thecontracts, these parties could thereby have bound nobody but themselves, and noproperty but their own. They could have bound nobody that should have come afterthem, and no property subsequently created by, or belonging to, other persons.XVIII.The Constitution having never been signed by anybody; and there being no otheropen, written, or authentic contract between any parties whatever, by virtue ofwhich the United States government, so called, is maintained; and it being wellknown that none but male persons, of twenty-one years of age and upwards, areallowed any voice in the government; and it being also well known that a largenumber of these adult persons seldom or never vote at all; and that all thosewho do vote, do so secretly (by secret ballot), and in a way to prevent theirindividual votes being known, either to the world, or even to each other; andconsequently in a way to make no one openly responsible for the acts of theiragents, or representatives,—all these things being known, the questions arise:Who compose the real governing power in the country? Who are the men, theresponsible men, who rob us of our property? Restrain us of our liberty? Subjectus to their arbitrary dominion? And devastate our homes, and shoot us down bythe hundreds of thousands, if we resist? How shall we find these men? How shallwe know them from others? How shall we defend ourselves and our property againstthem? Who, of our neighbors, are members of this secret band of robbers andmurderers? How can we know which are their houses, that we may bum or demolishthem? Which their property, that we may destroy it? Which their persons, that wemay kill them, and rid the world and ourselves of such tyrants and monsters?These are questions that must be answered, before men can be free; before theycan protect themselves against this secret band of robbers and murderers, whonow plunder, enslave, and destroy them.The answer to these questions is, that only those who have the will and thepower to shoot down their fellow men, are the real rulers in this, as in allother (so-called) civilized countries; for by no others will civilized men berobbed, or enslaved.Among savages, mere physical strength, on the part of one man, may enable him torob, enslave, or kill another man. Among barbarians, mere physical strength, onthe part of a body of men, disciplined, and acting in concert, though with verylittle money or other wealth, may, under some circumstances, enable them to rob,enslave, or kill another body of men, as numerous, or perhaps even morenumerous, than themselves. And among both savages and barbarians, mere want maysometimes compel one man to sell himself as a slave to another. But with(so-called) civilized peoples, among whom knowledge, wealth, and the means ofacting in concert, have become diffused; and who have invented such weapons andother means of defense as to render mere physical strength of less importance;and by whom soldiers in any requisite number, and other instrumentalities of warin any requisite amount, can always be had for money, the question of war, andconsequently the question of power, is little else than a mere question ofmoney. As a necessary consequence, those who stand ready to furnish this money,are the real rulers. It is so in Europe, and it is so in this country.In Europe, the nominal rulers, the emperors and kings and parliaments, areanything but the real rulers of their respective countries. They are little ornothing else than mere tools, employed by the wealthy to rob, enslave, and (ifneed be) murder those who have less wealth, or none at all.The Rothschilds,[6] and that class of money-lenders of whom they are therepresentatives and agents—men who never think of lending a shilling to theirnext-door neighbors, for purposes of honest industry, unless upon the most amplesecurity, and at the highest rate of interest—stand ready, at all times, to lendmoney in unlimited amounts to those robbers and murderers, who call themselvesgovernments, to be expended in shooting down those who do not submit quietly tobeing robbed and enslaved.They lend their money in this manner, knowing that it is to be expended inmurdering their fellow men, for simply seeking their liberty and their rights;knowing also that neither the interest nor the principal will ever be paid,except as it will be extorted under terror of the repetition of such murders asthose for which the money lent is to be expended.These money-lenders, the Rothschilds, for example, say to themselves: If we lenda hundred millions sterling to the queen and parliament of England, it willenable them to murder twenty, fifty, or a hundred thousand people in England,Ireland, or India; and the terror inspired by such wholesale murder, will enablethem to keep the whole people of those countries in subjection for twenty, orperhaps fifty, years to come; to control all their trade and industry; and toextort from them large amounts of money, under the name of taxes; and from thewealth thus extorted from them, they (the queen and parliament) can afford topay us a higher rate of interest for our money than we can get in any other way.Or, if we lend this sum to the emperor of Austria, it will enable him to murderso many of his people as to strike terror into the rest, and thus enable him tokeep them in subjection, and extort money from them, for twenty or fifty yearsto come. And they say the same in regard to the emperor of Russia, the king ofPrussia, the emperor of France, or any other ruler, so called, who, in theirjudgment, will be able, by murdering a reasonable portion of his people, to keepthe rest in subjection, and extort money from them, for a long time to come, topay the interest and principal of the money lent him.And why are these men so ready to lend money for murdering their fellow men?Solely for this reason, viz., that such loans are considered better investmentsthan loans for purposes of honest industry. They pay higher rates of interest;and it is less trouble to look after them. This is the whole matter.The question of making these loans is, with these lenders, a mere question ofpecuniary profit. They lend money to be expended in robbing, enslaving, andmurdering their fellow men, solely because, on the whole, such loans pay betterthan any others. They are no respecters of persons, no superstitious fools, thatreverence monarchs. They care no more for a king, or an emperor, than they dofor a beggar, except as he is a better customer, and can pay them betterinterest for their money. If they doubt his ability to make his murderssuccessful for maintaining his power, and thus extorting money from his peoplein future, they dismiss him as unceremoniously as they would dismiss any otherhopeless bankrupt, who should want to borrow money to save himself from openinsolvency.When these great lenders of blood-money, like the Rothschilds, have loaned vastsums in this way, for purposes of murder, to an emperor or a king, they sell outthe bonds taken by them, in small amounts, to anybody, and everybody, who aredisposed to buy them at satisfactory prices, to hold as investments. They (theRothschilds) thus soon get back their money, with great profits; and are nowready to lend money in the same way again to any other robber and murderer,called an emperor or a king, who, they think, is likely to be successful in hisrobberies and murders, and able to pay a good price for the money necessary tocarry them on.This business of lending blood-money is one of the most thoroughly sordid,cold-blooded, and criminal that was ever carried on, to any considerable extent,amongst human beings. It is like lending money to slave traders, or to commonrobbers and pirates, to be repaid out of their plunder. And the men who loanmoney to governments, so called, for the purpose of enabling the latter to rob,enslave, and murder their people, are among the greatest villains that the worldhas ever seen. And they as much deserve to be hunted and killed (if they cannototherwise be got rid of) as any slave traders, robbers, or pirates that everlived.When these emperors and kings, so-called, have obtained their loans, theyproceed to hire and train immense numbers of professional murderers, calledsoldiers, and employ them in shooting down all who resist their demands formoney. In fact, most of them keep large bodies of these murderers constantly intheir service, as their only means of enforcing their extortions. There are now,I think, four or five millions of these professional murderers constantlyemployed by the so-called sovereigns of Europe. The enslaved people are, ofcourse, forced to support and pay all these murderers, as well as to submit toall the other extortions which these murderers are employed to enforce.It is only in this way that most of the so-called governments of Europe aremaintained. These so-called governments are in reality only great bands ofrobbers and murderers, organized, disciplined, and constantly on the alert. Andthe so-called sovereigns, in these different governments, are simply the heads,or chiefs, of different bands of robbers and murderers. And these heads orchiefs are dependent upon the lenders of blood-money for the means to carry ontheir robberies and murders. They could not sustain themselves a moment but forthe loans made to them by these blood-money loan-mongers. And their first careis to maintain their credit with them; for they know their end is come, theinstant their credit with them fails. Consequently the first proceeds of theirextortions are scrupulously applied to the payment of the interest on theirloans.In addition to paying the interest on their bonds, they perhaps grant to theholders of them great monopolies in banking, like the Banks of England, ofFrance, and of Vienna; with the agreement that these banks shall furnish moneywhenever, in sudden emergencies, it may be necessary to shoot down more of theirpeople. Perhaps also, by means of tariffs on competing imports, they give greatmonopolies to certain branches of industry, in which these lenders ofblood-money are engaged. They also, by unequal taxation, exempt wholly orpartially the property of these loan-mongers, and throw corresponding burdensupon those who are too poor and weak to resist.Thus it is evident that all these men, who call themselves by the high-soundingnames of Emperors, Kings, Sovereigns, Monarchs, Most Christian Majesties, MostCatholic Majesties, High Mightinesses, Most Serene and Potent Princes, and thelike, and who claim to rule “by the grace of God,” by “Divine Right”—that is, byspecial authority from Heaven—are intrinsically not only the merest miscreantsand wretches, engaged solely in plundering, enslaving, and murdering theirfellow men, but that they are also the merest hangers on, the servile,obsequious, fawning dependents and tools of these blood-money loan-mongers, onwhom they rely for the means to carry on their crimes. These loan-mongers, likethe Rothschilds, laugh in their sleeves, and say to themselves: These despicablecreatures, who call themselves emperors, and kings, and majesties, and mostserene and potent princes; who profess to wear crowns, and sit on thrones; whodeck themselves with ribbons, and feathers, and jewels; and surround themselveswith hired flatterers and lickspittles; and whom we suffer to strut around, andpalm themselves off, upon fools and slaves, as sovereigns and lawgiversspecially appointed by Almighty God; and to hold themselves out as the solefountains of honors, and dignities, and wealth, and power—all these miscreantsand imposters know that we make them, and use them; that in us they live, move,and have their being; that we require them (as the price of their positions) totake upon themselves all the labor, all the danger, and all the odium of all thecrimes they commit for our profit; and that we will unmake them, strip them oftheir gewgaws, and send them out into the world as beggars, or give them over tothe vengeance of the people they have enslaved, the moment they refuse to commitany crime we require of them, or to pay over to us such share of the proceeds oftheir robberies as we see fit to demand.XIX.Now, what is true in Europe, is substantially true in this country. Thedifference is the immaterial one, that, in this country, there is no visible,permanent head, or chief, of these robbers and murderers, who call themselves“the government.” That is to say, there is no one man, who calls himself thestate, or even emperor, king, or sovereign; no one who claims that he and hischildren rule “by the Grace of God,” by “Divine Right,” or by specialappointment from Heaven. There are only certain men, who call themselvespresidents, senators, and representatives, and claim to be the authorizedagents, for the time being, or for certain short periods, of all “the people ofthe United States”; but who can show no credentials, or powers of attorney, orany other open, authentic evidence that they are so; and who notoriously are notso; but are really only the agents of a secret band of robbers and murderers,whom they themselves do not know, and have no means of knowing, individually;but who, they trust, will openly or secretly, when the crisis comes, sustainthem in all their usurpations and crimes.What is important to be noticed is, that these so-called presidents, senators,and representatives, these pretended agents of all “the people of the UnitedStates,” the moment their exactions meet with any formidable resistance from anyportion of “the people” themselves, are obliged, like their co-robbers andmurderers in Europe, to fly at once to the lenders of blood money, for the meansto sustain their power. And they borrow their money on the same principle, andfor the same purpose, viz., to be expended in shooting down all those “people ofthe United States”—their own constituents and principals, as they profess tocall them—who resist the robberies and enslavement which these borrowers of themoney are practising upon them. And they expect to repay the loans, if at all,only from the proceeds of the future robberies, which they anticipate it will beeasy for them and their successors to perpetrate through a long series of years,upon their pretended principals, if they can but shoot down now some hundreds ofthousands of them, and thus strike terror into the rest.Perhaps the facts were never made more evident, in any country on the globe,than in our own, that these soulless blood-money loan-mongers are the realrulers; that they rule from the most sordid and mercenary motives; that theostensible government, the presidents, senators, and representatives, so called,are merely their tools; and that no ideas of, or regard for, justice or libertyhad anything to do in inducing them to lend their money for the war. In proof ofall this, look at the following facts.Nearly a hundred years ago we professed to have got rid of all that religioussuperstition, inculcated by a servile and corrupt priesthood in Europe, thatrulers, so called, derived their authority directly from Heaven; and that it wasconsequently a religious duty on the part of the people to obey them. Weprofessed long ago to have learned that governments could rightfully exist onlyby the free will, and on the voluntary support, of those who might choose tosustain them. We all professed to have known long ago, that the only legitimateobjects of government were the maintenance of liberty and justice equally forall. All this we had professed for nearly a hundred years. And we professed tolook with pity and contempt upon those ignorant, superstitious, and enslavedpeoples of Europe, who were so easily kept in subjection by the frauds and forceof priests and kings.Notwithstanding all this, that we had learned, and known, and professed, fornearly a century, these lenders of blood money had, for a long series of yearsprevious to the war, been the willing accomplices of the slave-holders inperverting the government from the purposes of liberty and justice, to thegreatest of crimes. They had been such accomplices for a purely pecuniaryconsideration, to wit, a control of the markets in the South; in other words,the privilege of holding the slave-holders themselves in industrial andcommercial subjection to the manufacturers and merchants of the North (whoafterwards furnished the money for the war). And these Northern merchants andmanufacturers, these lenders of blood-money, were willing to continue to be theaccomplices of the slave-holders in the future, for the same pecuniaryconsideration. But the slave-holders, either doubting the fidelity of theirNorthern allies, or feeling themselves strong enough to keep their slaves insubjection without Northern assistance, would no longer pay the price whichthese Northern men demanded. And it was to enforce this price in the future—thatis, to monopolize the Southern markets, to maintain their industrial andcommercial control over the South—that these Northern manufacturers andmerchants lent some of the profits of their former monopolies for the war, inorder to secure to themselves the same, or greater, monopolies in the future.These—and not any love of liberty or justice—were the motives on which the moneyfor the war was lent by the North. In short, the North said to theslave-holders: If you will not pay us our price (give us control of yourmarkets) for our assistance against your slaves, we will secure the same price(keep control of your markets) by helping your slaves against you, and usingthem as our tools for maintaining dominion over you; for the control of yourmarkets we will have, whether the tools we use for that purpose be black orwhite, and be the cost, in blood and money, what it may.On this principle, and from this motive, and not from any love of liberty, orjustice, the money was lent in enormous amounts, and at enormous rates ofinterest. And it was only by means of these loans that the objects of the warwere accomplished.And now these lenders of blood-money demand their pay; and the government, socalled, becomes their tool, their servile, slavish, villainous tool, to extortit from the labor of the enslaved people both of the North and the South. It isto be extorted by every form of direct, and indirect, and unequal taxation. Notonly the nominal debt and interest—enormous as the latter was—are to be paid infull; but these holders of the debt are to be paid still further—and perhapsdoubly, triply, or quadruply paid—by such tariffs on imports as will enable ourhome manufacturers to realize enormous prices for their commodities; also bysuch monopolies in banking as will enable them to keep control of, and thusenslave and plunder, the industry and trade of the great body of the Northernpeople themselves. In short, the industrial and commercial slavery of the greatbody of the people, North and South, black and white, is the price which theselenders of blood money demand, and insist upon, and are determined to secure, inreturn for the money lent for the war.This programme having been fully arranged and systematized, they put their swordinto the hands of the chief murderer of the war,[7] and charge him to carrytheir scheme into effect. And now he, speaking as their organ, says: “Let ushave peace.”The meaning of this is: Submit quietly to all the robbery and slavery we havearranged for you, and you can have “peace.” But in case you resist, the samelenders of blood-money, who furnished the means to subdue the South, willfurnish the means again to subdue you.These are the terms on which alone this government, or, with few exceptions, anyother, ever gives “peace” to its people.The whole affair, on the part of those who furnished the money, has been, andnow is, a deliberate scheme of robbery and murder; not merely to monopolize themarkets of the South, but also to monopolize the currency, and thus control theindustry and trade, and thus plunder and enslave the laborers, of both North andSouth. And Congress and the president are today the merest tools for thesepurposes. They are obliged to be, for they know that their own power, as rulers,so-called, is at an end, the moment their credit with the blood-moneyloan-mongers fails. They are like a bankrupt in the hands of an extortioner.They dare not say nay to any demand made upon them. And to hide at once, ifpossible, both their servility and their crimes, they attempt to divert publicattention, by crying out that they have “Abolished Slavery!” That they have“Saved the Country!” That they have “Preserved our Glorious Union!” and that, innow paying the “National Debt,” as they call it (as if the people themselves,all of them who are to be taxed for its payment, had really and voluntarilyjoined in contracting it), they are simply “Maintaining the National Honor!”By “maintaining the national honor,” they mean simply that they themselves, openrobbers and murderers, assume to be the nation, and will keep faith with thosewho lend them the money necessary to enable them to crush the great body of thepeople under their feet; and will faithfully appropriate, from the proceeds oftheir future robberies and murders, enough to pay all their loans, principal andinterest.The pretense that the “abolition of slavery” was either a motive orjustification for the war, is a fraud of the same character with that of“maintaining the national honor.” Who, but such usurpers, robbers, and murderersas they, ever established slavery? Or what government, except one resting uponthe sword, like the one we now have, was ever capable of maintaining slavery?And why did these men abolish slavery? Not from any love of liberty ingeneral—not as an act of justice to the black man himself, but only “as a warmeasure,” and because they wanted his assistance, and that of his friends, incarrying on the war they had undertaken for maintaining and intensifying thatpolitical, commercial, and industrial slavery, to which they have subjected thegreat body of the people, both white and black. And yet these imposters now cryout that they have abolished the chattel slavery of the black man—although thatwas not the motive of the war—as if they thought they could thereby conceal,atone for, or justify that other slavery which they were fighting to perpetuate,and to render more rigorous and inexorable than it ever was before. There was nodifference of principle—but only of degree—between the slavery they boast theyhave abolished, and the slavery they were fighting to preserve; for allrestraints upon men’s natural liberty, not necessary for the simple maintenanceof justice, are of the nature of slavery, and differ from each other only indegree.If their object had really been to abolish slavery, or maintain liberty orjustice generally, they had only to say: All, whether white or black, who wantthe protection of this government, shall have it; and all who do not want it,will be left in peace, so long as they leave us in peace. Had they said this,slavery would necessarily have been abolished at once; the war would have beensaved; and a thousand times nobler union than we have ever had would have beenthe result. It would have been a voluntary union of free men; such a union aswill one day exist among all men, the world over, if the several nations, socalled, shall ever get rid of the usurpers, robbers, and murderers, calledgovernments, that now plunder, enslave, and destroy them.Still another of the frauds of these men is, that they are now establishing, andthat the war was designed to establish, “a government of consent.” The only ideathey have ever manifested as to what is a government of consent, is this—that itis one to which everybody must consent, or be shot. This idea was the dominantone on which the war was carried on; and it is the dominant one, now that wehave got what is called “peace.”Their pretenses that they have “Saved the Country,” and “Preserved our GloriousUnion,” are frauds like all the rest of their pretenses. By them they meansimply that they have subjugated, and maintained their power over, an unwillingpeople. This they call “Saving the Country”; as if an enslaved and subjugatedpeople—or as if any people kept in subjection by the sword (as it is intendedthat all of us shall be hereafter)—could be said to have any country. This, too,they call “Preserving our Glorious Union”; as if there could be said to be anyUnion, glorious or inglorious, that was not voluntary. Or as if there could besaid to be any union between masters and slaves; between those who conquer, andthose who are subjugated.All these cries of having “abolished slavery,” of having “saved the country,” ofhaving “preserved the union,” of establishing “a government of consent,” and of“maintaining the national honor,” are all gross, shameless, transparentcheats—so transparent that they ought to deceive no one—when uttered asjustifications for the war, or for the government that has succeeded the war, orfor now compelling the people to pay the cost of the war, or for compellinganybody to support a government that he does not want.The lesson taught by all these facts is this: As long as mankind continue to pay“national debts,” so-called—that is, so long as they are such dupes and cowardsas to pay for being cheated, plundered, enslaved, and murdered—so long therewill be enough to lend the money for those purposes; and with that money aplenty of tools, called soldiers, can be hired to keep them in subjection. Butwhen they refuse any longer to pay for being thus cheated, plundered, enslaved,and murdered, they will cease to have cheats, and usurpers, and robbers, andmurderers and blood-money loan-mongers for masters.[8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] [This essay was written in 1869.][2] [In the presidential election of 1824, the first in American history forwhich there are reliable tabulations of popular votes, barely 350,000 votes werecast at a time when the population was approximately 11,000,000 (the figure forthe decennial census of 1820 was 9,638,453; that of 1830 was 12,866,020).][3] [In the 1868 election, which occurred just before Spooner was writing, atotal of about 5,700,000 votes were cast for the candidates, Gen. Ulysses S.Grant and Horatio Seymour; the population figure for the 1870 census was nearly40,000,000.][4] [Relative percentages of those voting out of the total population havesteadily increased since this was written but, in the main, Spooner’s conjecturewas borne out down until the adoption of the 19th Amendment, which ended sexualdiscrimination in national elections in 1920. The voters in the electionsbetween 1870 and 1920 varied from one fifth to one eighth of the wholepopulation. In recent years, since 1940, the figure has usually fluctuatedbetween one-third and two-fifths.][a] See No Treason, No. 2, pages 5 and 6.[b] Suppose it be “the best government on earth,” does that prove its owngoodness, or only the badness of all other governments?[c] The very men who drafted it, never signed it in any way to bind themselvesby it, as a contract. And not one of them probably ever would have signed it inany way to bind himself by it, as a contract.[d] I have personally examined the statute books of the following States, viz.:Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, NewYork, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, SouthCarolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio,Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa,Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Nevada, California, and Oregon, and find that inall these States the English statute has been reënacted, sometimes withmodifications, but generally enlarging its operations, and is now in force.The following are some of the provisions of the Massachusetts statute:“No action shall be brought in any of the following cases, that is to say: . . .“To charge a person upon a special promise to answer for the debt, default, ormisdoings of another: . . .“Upon a contract for the sale of lands, tenements, hereditaments, or of anyinterest in, or concerning them; or“Upon an agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the writingthereof:“Unless the promise, contract, or agreement, upon which such action is brought,or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing, and signed by the party to becharged therewith, or by some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.”“No contract for the sale of goods, wares, or merchandise, for the price offifty dollars or more, shall be good or valid, unless the purchaser accepts andreceives part of the goods so sold, or gives something in earnest to bind thebargain, or in part payment; or unless some note or memorandum in writing of thebargain is made and signed by the party to be charged thereby, or by some personthereunto by him lawfully authorized.”[e] And this two-thirds vote may be but two-thirds of a quorum—that istwo-thirds of a majority—instead of two-thirds of the whole.[f] Of what appreciable value is it to any man, as an individual, that he isallowed a voice in choosing these public masters? His voice is only one ofseveral millions.[5] [A reference to the national debt in December, 1869, which totaled$2,453,-000,000 and the approximate population of the country, 39,818,449people, according to the census the next year. A furious controversy was goingon when this was written as to how this debt was to be paid. See James G.Randall, The Civil War and Reconstruction (Boston: D. C. Heath & Co., 1937), pp.832–836.][6] [It is obvious from the context that Spooner intended no particular animustoward the Rothschilds by citing them in relation to the financing of variousregimes in a number of military adventures in that time. They are mentionedmainly because of their greater familiarity among a number of such internationalfinanciers. One is reminded that not all the enterprises of these money lenderswere necessarily successful, as there were losers as well as winners in theseState combats; the loan of the French house of Erlanger to the Confederacy inthe American Civil War, and that of the Austrian branch of the Rothschilds tothe Austrian government and its swift defeat by Prussia in the Seven Weeks’ Warof 1866, may be cited as examples. And, of course, the Rothschilds met theirmatch in such operations on more than one occasion; see, for example, theaccounts in Otto Wolff’s Ouvrard: Speculator of Genius (New York: David McKay,1962). There is a vast literature on this subject.Spooner overlooked a striking development in this area, the discovery of thepossibilities involved in fiat money operations by the State as an escape fromthe restraints imposed by a privately-controlled specie-backed money system. TheLincoln government’s issuance of greenbacks was the most successful example ofthe moment when Spooner was writing. Of course, in modern times, with theevolution of managed money, the State no longer need depend on financial houses,but is limited only by the amount of paper and ink, and public confidence,insofar as it can manufacture claims on production and present them in themarket place in competition with the citizenry for such goods and services asits objectives require.][7] [Undoubtedly a reference to General Grant, who had just become president.][8] [Despite the severity of his language, Spooner deserves recognition as oneof the few observers, in the period immediately after the Civil War, to dismissthe simple propaganda that the war was the consequence of the single-mindedobjective of abolishing chattel slavery, and to examine at least in part thedeeper material factors involved.]"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX.Inasmuch as the Constitution was never signed, nor agreed to, by anybody, as acontract, and therefore never bound anybody, and is now binding upon nobody; andis, moreover, such an one as no people can ever hereafter be expected to consentto, except as they may be forced to do so at the point of the bayonet, it isperhaps of no importance what its true legal meaning, as a contract, is.Nevertheless, the writer thinks it proper to say that, in his opinion, theConstitution is no such instrument as it has generally been assumed to be; butthat by false interpretations, and naked usurpations, the government has beenmade in practice a very widely, and almost wholly, different thing from what theConstitution itself purports to authorize. He has heretofore written much, andcould write much more, to prove that such is the truth. But whether theConstitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain—that it haseither authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless toprevent it. In either case, it is unfit to exist."},{"pageContent":"logo [../Images/splash.png]http://Liberty.me/"}]
