That is, it can dictate whatevidence is admissible, and what inadmissible, and also what force or weight isto be given to the evidence admitted. And if the government can thus dictate toa jury the laws of evidence, it can not only make it necessary for them toconvict on a partial exhibition of the evidence rightfully pertaining to thecase, but it can even require them to convict on any evidence whatever that itpleases to offer them.That the rights and duties of jurors must necessarily be such as are hereclaimed for them, will be evident when it is considered what the trial by juryis, and what is its object.“The trial by jury,” then, is a “trial by the country”—that is, by the people—asdistinguished from a trial by the government.It was anciently called “trial per pais”—that is, “trial by the country.” Andnow, in every criminal trial, the jury are told that the accused “has, fortrial, put himself upon the country; which country you (the jury) are.”The object of this trial “by the country,” or by the people, in preference to atrial by the government, is to guard against every species of oppression by thegovernment. In order to effect this end, it is indispensable that the people, or“the country,” judge of and determine their own liberties against thegovernment; instead of the government’s judging of and determining its ownpowers over the people. How is it possible that juries can do anything toprotect the liberties of the people against the government, if they are notallowed to determine what those liberties are?Any government, that is its own judge of, and determines authoritatively for thepeople, what are its own powers over the people, is an absolute government ofcourse. It has all the powers that it chooses to exercise. There is no other—orat least no more accurate—definition of a despotism than this.On the other hand, any people, that judge of, and determine authoritatively forthe government, what are their own liberties against the government, of courseretain all the liberties they wish to enjoy. And this is freedom. At least, itis freedom to them; because, although it may be theoretically imperfect, it,nevertheless, corresponds to their highest notions of freedom.To secure this right of the people to judge of their own liberties against thegovernment, the jurors are taken, (or must be, to make them lawful jurors,) fromthe body of the people, by lot, or by some process that precludes any previousknowledge, choice, or selection of them, on the part of the government. This isdone to prevent the government’s constituting a jury of its own partisans orfriends; in other words, to prevent the government’s packing a jury, with a viewto maintain its own laws, and accomplish its own purposes.It is supposed that, if twelve men be taken, by lot, from the mass of thepeople, without the possibility of any previous knowledge, choice, or selectionof them, on the part of the government, the jury will be a fair epitome of “thecountry” at large, and not merely of the party or faction that sustain themeasures of the government; that substantially all classes of opinions,prevailing among the people, will be represented in the jury; and especiallythat the opponents of the government, (if the government have any opponents,)will be represented there, as well as its friends; that the classes, who areoppressed by the laws of the government, (if any are thus oppressed,) will havetheir representatives in the jury, as well as those classes, who take sides withthe oppressor—that is, with the government.It is fairly presumable that such a tribunal will agree to no conviction exceptsuch as substantially the whole country would agree to, if they were present,taking part in the trial. A trial by such a tribunal is, therefore, in effect,“a trial by the country.” In its results it probably comes as near to a trial bythe whole country, as any trial that it is practicable to have, without toogreat inconvenience and expense. And as unanimity is required for a conviction,it follows that no one can be convicted, except for the violation of such lawsas substantially the whole country wish to have maintained. The government canenforce none of its laws, (by punishing offenders, through the verdicts ofjuries,) except such as substantially the whole people wish to have enforced.The government, therefore, consistently with the trial by jury, can exercise nopowers over the people, (or, what is the same thing, over the accused person,who represents the rights of the people,) except such as substantially the wholepeople of the country consent that it may exercise. In such a trial, therefore,“the country,” or the people, judge of and determine their own liberties againstthe government, instead of the government’s judging of and determining its ownpowers over the people.But all this “trial by the country” would be no trial at all “by the country,”but only a trial by the government, if the government could either declare whomay, and who may not, be jurors, or could dictate to the jury anything whatever,either of law or evidence, that is of the essence of the trial.If the government may decide who may, and who may not, be jurors, it will ofcourse select only its partisans, and those friendly to its measures. It may notonly prescribe who may, and who may not, be eligible to be drawn as jurors; butit may also question each person drawn as a juror, as to his sentiments inregard to the particular law involved in each trial, before suffering him to besworn on the panel; and exclude him if he be found unfavorable to themaintenance of such a law.[1]So, also, if the government may dictate to the jury what laws they are toenforce, it is no longer a “trial by the country,”but a trial by the government; because the jury then try the accused, not by anystandard of their own—not by their own judgments of their rightful liberties—butby a standard dictated to them by the government. And the standard, thusdictated by the government, becomes the measure of the people’s liberties. Ifthe government dictate the standard of trial, it of course dictates the resultsof the trial. And such a trial is no trial by the country, but only a trial bythe government; and in it the government determines what are its own powers overthe people, instead of the people’s determining what are their own libertiesagainst the government. In short, if the jury have no right to judge of thejustice of a law of the government, they plainly can do nothing to protect thepeople against the oppressions of the government; for there are no oppressionswhich the government may not authorize by law.The jury are also to judge whether the laws are rightly expounded to them by thecourt. Unless they judge on this point, they do nothing to protect theirliberties against the oppressions that are capable of being practised undercover of a corrupt exposition of the laws. If the judiciary can authoritativelydictate to a jury any exposition of the law, they can dictate to them the lawitself, and such laws as they please; because laws are, in practice, one thingor another, according as they are expounded.The jury must also judge whether there really be any such law, (be it good orbad,) as the accused is charged with having transgressed. Unless they judge onthis point, the people are liable to have their liberties taken from them bybrute force, without any law at all.The jury must also judge of the laws of evidence. If the government can dictateto a jury the laws of evidence, it can not only shut out any evidence itpleases, tending to vindicate the accused, but it can require that any evidencewhatever, that it pleases to offer, be held as conclusive proof of any offencewhatever which the government chooses to allege.It is manifest, therefore, that the jury must judge of and try the whole case,and every part and parcel of the case, free of any dictation or authority on thepart of the government. They must judge of the existence of the law; of the trueexposition of the law; of the justice of the law; and of the admissibility andweight of all the evidence offered; otherwise the government will haveeverything its own way; the jury will be mere puppets in the hands of thegovernment; and the trial will be, in reality, a trial by the government, andnot a “trial by the country.” By such trials the government will determine itsown powers over the people, instead of the people’s determining their ownliberties against the government; and it will be an entire delusion to talk, asfor centuries we have done, of the trial by jury, as a “palladium of liberty,”or as any protection to the people against the oppression and tyranny of thegovernment.The question, then, between trial by jury, as thus described, and trial by thegovernment, is simply a question between liberty and despotism. The authority tojudge what are the powers of the government, and what the liberties of thepeople, must necessarily be vested in one or the other of the partiesthemselves—the government, or the people; because there is no third party towhom it can be entrusted. If the authority be vested in the government, thegovernment is absolute, and the people have no liberties except such as thegovernment sees fit to indulge them with. If, on the other hand, that authoritybe vested in the people, then the people have all liberties, (as against thegovernment,) except such as substantially the whole people (through a jury)choose to disclaim; and the government can exercise no power except such assubstantially the whole people (through a jury) consent that it may exercise.SECTION II.The force and justice of the preceding argument cannot be evaded by saying thatthe government is chosen by the people; that, in theory, it represents thepeople; that it is designed to do the will of the people; that its members areall sworn to observe the fundamental or constitutional law instituted by thepeople; that its acts are therefore entitled to be considered the acts of thepeople; and that to allow a jury, representing the people, to invalidate theacts of the government, would therefore be arraying the people againstthemselves.There are two answers to such an argument.One answer is, that, in a representative government, there is no absurdity orcontradiction, nor any arraying of the people against themselves, in requiringthat the statutes or enactments of the government shall pass the ordeal of anynumber of separate tribunals, before it shall be determined that they are tohave the force of laws. Our American constitutions have provided five of theseseparate tribunals, to wit, representatives, senate, executive,[2] jury, andjudges; and have made it necessary that each enactment shall pass the ordeal ofall these separate tribunals, before its authority can be established by thepunishment of those who choose to transgress it. And there is no more absurdityor inconsistency in making a jury one of these several tribunals, than there isin making the representatives, or the senate, or the executive, or the judges,one of them. There is no more absurdity in giving a jury a veto upon the laws,than there is in giving a veto to each of these other tribunals. The people areno more arrayed against themselves, when a jury puts its veto upon a statute,which the other tribunals have sanctioned, than they are when the same veto isexercised by the representatives, the senate, the executive, or the judges.But another answer to the argument that the people are arrayed againstthemselves, when a jury hold an enactment of the government invalid, is, thatthe government, and all the departments of the government, are merely theservants and agents of the people; not invested with arbitrary or absoluteauthority to bind the people, but required to submit ail their enactments to thejudgment of a tribunal more fairly representing the whole people, before theycarry them into execution, by punishing any individual for transgressing them.If the government were not thus required to submit their enactments to thejudgment of “the country,” before executing them upon individuals—if, in otherwords, the people had reserved to themselves no veto upon the acts of thegovernment, the government, instead of being a mere servant and agent of thepeople, would be an absolute despot over the people. It would have all power inits own hands; because the power to punish carries all other powers with it. Apower that can, of itself, and by its own authority, punish disobedience, cancompel obedience and submission, and is above all responsibility for thecharacter of its laws. In short, it is a despotism.And it is of no consequence to inquire how a government came by this power topunish, whether by prescription, by inheritance, by usurpation, or by delegationfrom the people? If it have now but got it, the government is absolute.It is plain, therefore, that if the people have invested the government withpower to make laws that absolutely bind the people, and to punish the people fortransgressing those laws, the people have surrendered their libertiesunreservedly into the hands of the government.It is of no avail to say, in answer to this view of the case, that insurrendering their liberties into the hands of the government, the people tookan oath from the government, that it would exercise its power within certainconstitutional limits; for when did oaths ever restrain a government that wasotherwise unrestrained? Or when did a government fail to determine that all itsacts were within the constitutional and authorized limits of its power, if itwere permitted to determine that question for itself?Neither is it of any avail to say, that, if the government abuse its power, andenact unjust and oppressive laws, the government may be changed by the influenceof discussion, and the exercise of the right of suffrage. Discussion can donothing to prevent the enactment, or procure the repeal, of unjust laws, unlessit be understood that the discussion is to be followed by resistance. Tyrantscare nothing for discussions that are to end only in discussion. Discussions,which do not interfere with the enforcement of their laws, are but idle wind tothem. Suffrage is equally powerless and unreliable. It can be exercised onlyperiodically; and the tyranny must at least be borne until the time for suffragecomes. Besides, when the suffrage is exercised, it gives no guaranty for therepeal of existing laws that are oppressive, and no security against theenactment of new ones that are equally so. The second body of legislators areliable and likely to be just as tyrannical as the first. If it be said that thesecond body may be chosen for their integrity, the answer is, that the firstwere chosen for that very reason, and yet proved tyrants. The second will beexposed to the same temptations as the first, and will be just as likely toprove tyrannical. Who ever heard that succeeding legislatures were, on thewhole, more honest than those that preceded them? What is there in the nature ofmen or things to make them so? If it be said that the first body were chosenfrom motives of injustice, that fact proves that there is a portion of societywho desire to establish injustice; and if they were powerful or artful enough toprocure the election of their instruments to compose the first legislature, theywill be likely to be powerful or artful enough to procure the election of thesame or similar instruments to compose the second. The right of suffrage,therefore, and even a change of legislators, guarantees no change oflegislation—certainly no change for the better. Even if a change for the betteractually comes, it comes too late, because it comes only after more or lessinjustice has been irreparably done.But, at best, the right of suffrage can be exercised only periodically; andbetween the periods the legislators are wholly irresponsible. No despot was evermore entirely irresponsible than are republican legislators during the periodfor which they are chosen. They can neither be removed from their office, norcalled to account while in their office, nor punished after they leave theiroffice, be their tyranny what it may. Moreover, the judicial and executivedepartments of the government are equally irresponsible to the people, and areonly responsible, (by impeachment, and dependence for their salaries), to theseirresponsible legislators. This dependence of the judiciary and executive uponthe legislature is a guaranty that they will always sanction and execute itslaws, whether just or unjust. Thus the legislators hold the whole power of thegovernment in their hands, and are at the same time utterly irresponsible forthe manner in which they use it.If, now, this government, (the three branches thus really united in one), candetermine the validity of, and enforce, its own laws, it is, for the time being,entirely absolute, and wholly irresponsible to the people.But this is not all. These legislators, and this government, so irresponsiblewhile in power, can perpetuate their power at pleasure, if they can determinewhat legislation is authoritative upon the people, and can enforce obedience toit; for they can not only declare their power perpetual, but they can enforcesubmission to all legislation that is necessary to secure its perpetuity. Theycan, for example, prohibit all discussion of the rightfulness of theirauthority; forbid the use of the suffrage; prevent the election of anysuccessors; disarm, plunder, imprison, and even kill all who refuse submission.If, therefore, the government (all departments united) be absolute for aday—that is, if it can, for a day, enforce obedience to its own laws—it can, inthat day, secure its power for all time—like the queen, who wished to reign butfor a day, but in that day caused the king, her husband, to be slain, andusurped his throne.Nor will it avail to say that such acts would be unconstitutional, and thatunconstitutional acts may be lawfully resisted; for everything a governmentpleases to do will, of course, be determined to be constitutional, if thegovernment itself be permitted to determine the question of theconstitutionality of its own acts. Those who are capable of tyranny, are capableof perjury to sustain it.The conclusion, therefore, is, that any government, that can, for a day, enforceits own laws, without appealing to the people, (or to a tribunal fairlyrepresenting the people,) for their consent, is, in theory, an absolutegovernment, irresponsible to the people, and can perpetuate its power atpleasure.The trial by jury is based upon a recognition of this principle, and thereforeforbids the government to execute any of its laws, by punishing violators, inany case whatever, without first getting the consent of “the country,” or thepeople, through a jury. In this way, the people, at all times, hold theirliberties in their own hands, and never surrender them, even for a moment, intothe hands of the government.The trial by jury, then, gives to any and every individual the liberty, at anytime, to disregard or resist any law whatever of the government, if he bewilling to submit to the decision of a jury, the questions, whether the law beintrinsically just and obligatory? and whether his conduct, in disregarding orresisting it, were right in itself? And any law, which does not, in such trial,obtain the unanimous sanction of twelve men, taken at random from the people,and judging according to the standard of justice in their own minds, free fromall dictation and authority of the government, may be transgressed and resistedwith impunity, by whomsoever pleases to transgress or resist it.[3]The trial by jury authorizes all this, or it is a sham and a hoax, utterlyworthless for protecting the people against oppression. If it do not authorizean individual to resist the first and least act of injustice or tyranny, on thepart of the government, it does not authorize him to resist the last and thegreatest. If it do not authorize individuals to nip tyranny in the bud, it doesnot authorize them to cut it down when its branches are filled with the ripefruits of plunder and oppression.Those who deny the right of a jury to protect an individual in resisting anunjust law of the government, deny him all legal defence whatsoever againstoppression. The right of revolution, which tyrants, in mockery, accord tomankind, is no legal right under a government; it is only a natural right tooverturn a government. The government itself never acknowledges this right. Andthe right is practically established only when and because the government nolonger exists to call it in question. The right, therefore, can be exercisedwith impunity, only when it is exercised victoriously. All unsuccessful attemptsat revolution, however justifiable in themselves, are punished as treason, ifthe government be permitted to judge of the treason. The government itself neveradmits the injustice of its laws, as a legal defence for those who haveattempted a revolution, and failed. The right of revolution, therefore, is aright of no practical value, except for those who are stronger than thegovernment. So long, therefore, as the oppressions of a government are keptwithin such limits as simply not to exasperate against it a power greater thanits own, the right of revolution cannot be appealed to, and is thereforeinapplicable to the case. This affords a wide field for tyranny; and if a jurycannot here intervene, the oppressed are utterly defenceless.It is manifest that the only security against the tyranny of the government liesin forcible resistance to the execution of the injustice; because the injusticewill certainly be executed, unless it be forcibly resisted. And if it be butsuffered to be executed, it must then be borne; for the government never makescompensation for its own wrongs.Since, then, this forcible resistance to the injustice of the government is theonly possible means of preserving liberty, it is indispensable to all legalliberty that this resistance should be legalized. It is perfectly self-evidentthat where there is no legal right to resist the oppression of the government,there can be no legal liberty. And here it is all-important to notice, that,practically speaking, there can be no legal right to resist the oppressions ofthe government, unless there be some legal tribunal, other than the government,and wholly independent of, and above, the government, to judge between thegovernment and those who resist its oppressions; in other words, to judge whatlaws of the government are to be obeyed, and what may be resisted and held fornought. The only tribunal known to our laws, for this purpose, is a jury. If ajury have not the right to judge between the government and those who disobeyits laws, and resist its oppressions, the government is absolute, and thepeople, legally speaking, are slaves. Like many other slaves they may havesufficient courage and strength to keep their masters somewhat in check; butthey are nevertheless known to the law only as slaves.That this right of resistance was recognized as a common law right, when theancient and genuine trial by jury was in force, is not only proved by the natureof the trial itself, but is acknowledged by history.[4]This right of resistance is recognized by the constitution of the United States,as a strictly legal and constitutional right. It is so recognized, first by theprovision that “the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shallbe by jury”—that is, by the country—and not by the government; secondly, by theprovision that “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not beinfringed.” This constitutional security for “the right to keep and bear arms,”implies the right to use them—as much as a constitutional security for the rightto buy and keep food would have implied the right to eat it. The constitution,therefore, takes it for granted that the people will judge of the conduct of thegovernment, and that, as they have the right, they will also have the sense, touse arms, whenever the necessity of the case justifies it. And it is asufficient and legal defence for a person accused of using arms against thegovernment, if he can show, to the satisfaction of a jury, or even any me of ajury, that the law he resisted was an unjust one.In the American State constitutions also, this right of resistance to theoppressions of the government is recognized, in various ways, as a natural,legal, and constitutional right. In the first place, it is so recognized byprovisions establishing the trial by jury; thus requiring that accused personsshall be tried by “the country,” instead of the government. In the second place,it is recognized by many of them, as, for example, those of Massachusetts,Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky,Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, by provisions expresslydeclaring that the people shall have the right to bear arms. In many of themalso, as, for example, those of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Florida, Iowa, andArkansas, by provisions, in their bills of rights, declaring that men have anatural, inherent, and inalienable right of “defending their lives andliberties.” This, of course, means that they have a right to defend them againstany injustice on the part of the government, and not merely on the part ofprivate individuals; because the object of all bills of rights is to assert therights of individuals and the people, as against the government, and not asagainst private persons. It would be a matter of ridiculous supererogation toassert, in a constitution of government, the natural right of men to defendtheir lives and liberties against private trespassers.Many of these bills of rights also assert the natural right of all men toprotect their property—that is, to protect it against the government. It wouldbe unnecessary and silly indeed to assert, in a constitution of government, thenatural right of individuals to protect their property against thieves androbbers.The constitutions of New Hampshire and Tennessee also declare that “The doctrineof non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression is absurd, slavish, anddestructive of the good and happiness of mankind.”The legal effect of these constitutional recognitions of the right ofindividuals to defend their property, liberties, and lives, against thegovernment, is to legalize resistance to all injustice and oppression, of everyname and nature whatsoever, on the part of the government.But for this right of resistance, on the part of the people, all governmentswould become tyrannical to a degree of which few people are aware. Constitutionsare utterly worthless to restrain the tyranny of governments, unless it beunderstood that the people will, by force, compel the government to keep withinthe constitutional limits. Practically speaking, no government knows any limitsto its power, except the endurance of the people. But that the people arestronger than the government, and will resist in extreme cases, our governmentswould be little or nothing else than organized systems of plunder andoppression. All, or nearly all, the advantage there is in fixing anyconstitutional limits to the power of a government, is simply to give notice tothe government of the point at which it will meet with resistance. If the peopleare then as good as their word, they may keep the government within the boundsthey have set for it; otherwise it will disregard them—as is proved by theexample of all our American governments, in which the constitutions have allbecome obsolete, at the moment of their adoption, for nearly or quite allpurposes except the appointment of officers, who at once become practicallyabsolute, except so far as they are restrained by the fear of popularresistance.The bounds set to the power of the government, by the trial by jury, as willhereafter be shown, are these—that the government shall never touch theproperty, person, or natural or civil rights of an individual, against hisconsent, (except for the purpose of bringing them before a jury for trial,)unless in pursuance and execution of a judgment, or decree, rendered by a juryin each individual case, upon such evidence, and such law, as are satisfactoryto their own understandings and consciences, irrespective of all legislation ofthe government.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] To show that this supposition is not an extravagant one, it may be mentionedthat courts have repeatedly questioned jurors to ascertain whether they wereprejudiced against the government—that is, whether they were in favor of, oropposed to, such laws of the government as were to be put in issue in the thenpending trial. This was done (in 1851) in the United States District Court forthe District of Massachusetts, by Peleg Sprague, the United States districtjudge, in empanelling three several juries for the trials of Scott, Hayden, andMorris, charged with having aided in the rescue of a fugitive slave from thecustody of the United States deputy marshal. This judge caused the followingquestion to be propounded to all the jurors separately; and those who answeredunfavorably for the purposes of the government, were excluded from the panel.“Do you hold any opinions upon the subject of the Fugitive Slave Law, so called,which will induce you to refuse to convict a person indicted under it, if thefacts set forth in the indictment, and constituting the offence, are provedagainst him, and the court direct you that the law is constitutional?”The reason of this question was, that “the Fugitive Slave Law, so called,” wasso obnoxious to a large portion of the people, as to render a conviction underit hopeless, if the jurors were taken indiscriminately from among the people.A similar question was soon afterwards propounded to the persons drawn as jurorsin the United States Circuit Court for the District of Massachusetts, byBenjamin R. Curtis, one of the Justices of the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates, in empanelling a jury for the trial of the aforesaid Morris on thecharge before mentioned; and those who did not answer the question favorably forthe government were again excluded from the panel.It has also been an habitual practice with the Supreme Court of Massachusetts,in empanelling juries for the trial of capital offences, to inquire of thepersons drawn as jurors whether they had any conscientious scruples againstfinding verdicts of guilty in such cases; that is, whether they had anyconscientious scruples against sustaining the law prescribing death as thepunishment of the crime to be tried; and to exclude from the panel all whoanswered in the affirmative.The only principle upon which these questions are asked, is this—that no manshall be allowed to serve as juror, unless he be ready to enforce any enactmentof the government, however cruel or tyrannical it may be.What is such a jury good for, as a protection against the tyranny of thegovernment? A jury like that is palpably nothing but a mere tool of oppressionin the hands of the government. A trial by such a jury is really a trial by thegovernment itself—and not a trial by the country—because it is a trial only bymen specially selected by the government for their readiness to enforce its owntyrannical measures.If that be the true principle of the trial by jury, the trial is utterlyworthless as a security to liberty. The Czar might, with perfect safety to hisauthority, introduce the trial by jury into Russia, if he could but be permittedto select his jurors from those who were ready to maintain his laws, withoutregard to their injustice.This example is sufficient to show that the very pith of the trial by jury, as asafeguard to liberty, consists in the jurors being taken indiscriminately fromthe whole people, and in their right to hold invalid all laws which they thinkunjust.[2] The executive has a qualified veto upon the passage of laws, in most of ourgovernments, and an absolute veto, in all of them, upon the execution of anylaws which he deems unconstitutional; because his oath to support theconstitution (as he understands it) forbids him to execute any law that he deemsunconstitutional.[3] And if there be so much as a reasonable doubt of the justice of the laws,the benefit of that doubt must be given to the defendant, and not to thegovernment. So that the government must keep its laws clearly within the limitsof justice, if it would ask a jury to enforce them.[4] Hallam says, “The relation established between a lord and his vassal by thefeudal tenure, far from containing principles of any servile and implicitobedience, permitted the compact to be dissolved in case of its violation byeither party. This extended as much to the sovereign as to inferior lords. * *If a vassal was aggrieved, and if justice was denied him, he sent a defiance,that is, a renunciation of fealty to the king, and was entitled to enforceredress at the point of his sword. It then became a contest of strength asbetween two independent potentates, and was terminated by treaty, advantageousor otherwise, according to the fortune of war. * * There remained the originalprinciple, that allegiance depended conditionally upon good treatment, and thatan appeal might be lawfully made to arms against an oppressive government. Norwas this, we may be sure, left for extreme necessity, or thought to require along-enduring forbearance. In modern times, a king, compelled by his subjects’swords to abandon any pretension, would be supposed to have ceased to reign; andthe express recognition of such a right as that of insurrection has been justlydeemed inconsistent with the majesty of law. But ruder ages had rudersentiments. Force was necessary to repel force; and men accustomed to see theking’s authority defied by a private riot, were not much shocked when it wasresisted in defence of public freedom.”—3 Middle Ages, 240–2."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER II.THE TRIAL BY JURY, AS DEFINED BY MAGNA CARTA.That the trial by jury is all that has been claimed for it in the precedingchapter, is proved both by the history and the language of the Great Charter ofEnglish Liberties, to which we are to look for a true definition of the trial byjury, and of which the guaranty for that trial is the vital, and most memorable,part.SECTION I.THE HISTORY OF MAGNA CARTA.In order to judge of the object and meaning of that chapter of Magna Carta whichsecures the trial by jury, it is to be borne in mind that, at the time of MagnaCarta, the king (with exceptions immaterial to this discussion, but which willappear hereafter) was, constitutionally, the entire government; the solelegislative, judicial, and executive power of the nation. The executive andjudicial officers were merely his servants, appointed by him, and removable athis pleasure. In addition to this, “the king himself often sat in his court,which always attended his person. He there heard causes, and pronouncedjudgment; and though he was assisted by the advice of other members, it is notto be imagined that a decision could be obtained contrary to his inclination oropinion.”[1] Judges were in those days, and afterwards, such abject servants ofthe king, that “we find that King Edward I. (1272 to 1307) fined and imprisonedhis judges, in the same manner as Alfred the Great, among the Saxons, had donebefore him, by the sole exercise of his authority.”[2]Parliament, so far as there was a parliament, was a mere council of the king.[3]It assembled only at the pleasure of the king; sat only during his pleasure; andwhen sitting had no power, so far as general legislation was concerned, beyondthat of simply advising the king. The only legislation to which their assent wasconstitutionally necessary, was demands for money and military services forextraordinary occasions. Even Magna Carta itself makes no provisions whateverfor any parliaments, except when the king should want means to carry on war, orto meet some other extraordinary necessity.[4] He had no need of parliaments toraise taxes for the ordinary purposes of government; for his revenues from therents of the crown lands and other sources, were ample for all exceptextraordinary occasions. Parliaments, too, when assembled, consisted only ofbishops, barons, and other great men of the kingdom, unless the king chose toinvite others.[5] There was no House of Commons at that time, and the people hadno right to be heard, unless as petitioners.[6]Even when laws were made at the time of a parliament, they were made in the nameof the king alone. Sometimes it was inserted in the laws, that they were madewith the consent or advice of the bishops, barons, and others assembled; butoften this was omitted. Their consent or advice was evidently a matter of nolegal importance to the enactment or validity of the laws, but only inserted,when inserted at all, with a view of obtaining a more willing submission to themon the part of the people. The style of enactment generally was, either “TheKing wills and commands,” or some other form significant of the sole legislativeauthority of the king. The king could pass laws at any time when it pleased him.The presence of a parliament was wholly unnecessary. Hume says, “It is assertedby Sir Harry Spelman, as an undoubted fact, that, during the reigns of theNorman princes, every order of the king, issued with the consent of his privycouncil, had the full force of law.”[7] And other authorities abundantlycorroborate this assertion.[8]The king was, therefore, constitutionally the government; and the only legallimitation upon his power seems to have been simply the Common Law, usuallycalled “the law of the land” which he was bound by oath to maintain; (which oathhad about the same practical value as similar oaths have always had.) This “lawof the land” seems not to have been regarded at all by many of the kings, exceptso far as they found it convenient to do so, or were constrained to observe itby the fear of arousing resistance. But as all people are slow in makingresistance, oppression and usurpation often reached a great height; and, in thecase of John, they had become so intolerable as to enlist the nation almostuniversally against him; and he was reduced to the necessity of complying withany terms the barons saw fit to dictate to him.It was under these circumstances, that the Great Charter of English Libertieswas granted. The barons of England, sustained by the common people, having theirking in their power, compelled him, as the price of his throne, to pledgehimself that he would punish no freeman for a violation of any of his laws,unless with the consent of the peers—that is, the equals—of the accused.The question here arises, Whether the barons and people intended that thosepeers (the jury) should be mere puppets in the hands of the king, exercising noopinion of their own as to the intrinsic merits of the accusations they shouldtry, or the justice of the laws they should be called on to enforce? Whetherthose haughty and victorious barons, when they had their tyrant king at theirfeet, gave back to him his throne, with full power to enact any tyrannical lawshe might please, reserving only to a jury (“the country”) the contemptible andservile privilege of ascertaining, (under the dictation of the king, or hisjudges, as to the laws of evidence), the simple fact whether those laws had beentransgressed? Was this the only restraint, which, when they had all power intheir hands, they placed upon the tyranny of a king, whose oppressions they hadrisen in arms to resist? Was it to obtain such a charter as that, that the wholenation had united, as it were, like one man, against their king? Was it on sucha charter that they intended to rely, for all future time, for the security oftheir liberties? No. They were engaged in no such senseless work as that. On thecontrary, when they required him to renounce forever the power to punish anyfreeman, unless by the consent of his peers, they intended those peers shouldjudge of, and try, the whole case on its merits, independently of all arbitrarylegislation, or judicial authority, on the part of the king. In this way theytook the liberties of each individual—and thus the liberties of the wholepeople—entirely out of the hands of the king, and out of the power of his laws,and placed them in the keeping of the people themselves. And this it was thatmade the trial by jury the palladium of their liberties.The trial by jury, be it observed, was the only real barrier interposed by themagainst absolute despotism. Could this trial, then, have been such an entirefarce as it necessarily must have been, if the jury had had no power to judge ofthe justice of the laws the people were required to obey? Did it not ratherimply that the jury were to judge independently and fearlessly as to everythinginvolved in the charge, and especially as to its intrinsic justice, and thereongive their decision, (unbiased by any legislation of the king,) whether theaccused might be punished? The reason of the thing, no less than the historicalcelebrity of the events, as securing the liberties of the people, and theveneration with which the trial by jury has continued to be regarded,notwithstanding its essence and vitality have been almost entirely extractedfrom it in practice, would settle the question, if other evidences had left thematter in doubt.Besides, if his laws were to be authoritative with the jury, why should Johnindignantly refuse, as at first he did, to grant the charter, (and finally grantit only when brought to the last extremity,) on the ground that it deprived himof all power, and left him only the name of a king? He evidently understood thatthe juries were to veto his laws, and paralyze his power, at discretion, byforming their own opinions as to the true character of the offences they were totry, and the laws they were to be called on to enforce; and that “the king willsand commands” was to have no weight with them contrary to their own judgments ofwhat was intrinsically right.[9]The barons and people having obtained by the charter all the liberties they haddemanded of the king, it was further provided by the charter itself thattwenty-five barons should be appointed by the barons, out of their number, tokeep special vigilance in the kingdom to see that the charter was observed, withauthority to make war upon the king in case of its violation. The king also, bythe charter, so far absolved all the people of the kingdom from their allegianceto him, as to authorize and require them to swear to obey the twenty-fivebarons, in case they should make war upon the king for infringement of thecharter. It was then thought by the barons and people, that somethingsubstantial had been done for the security of their liberties.This charter, in its most essential features, and without any abatement as tothe trial by jury, has since been confirmed more than thirty times; and thepeople of England have always had a traditionary idea that it was of some valueas a guaranty against oppression. Yet that idea has been an entire delusion,unless the jury have had the right to judge of the justice of the laws they werecalled on to enforce.SECTION II.THE LANGUAGE OF MAGNA CARTA.The language of the Great Charter establishes the same point that is establishedby its history, viz., that it is the right and duty of the jury to judge of thejustice of the laws.The chapter guaranteeing the trial by jury is in these words:> “Nullus liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur, aut disseisetur, aut utlagetur,> aut exuletur, aut aliquo modo destruatur; nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum> mittemus, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terræ.”[10]The corresponding chapter in the Great Charter, granted by Henry III., (1225,)and confirmed by Edward I., (1297,) (which charter is now considered the basisof the English laws and constitution,) is in nearly the same words, as follows:> “Nullus liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur, aut disseisetur de libero> tenemento, vel libertatibus, vel liberis consuetudinibus suis, ant utlagetur,> aut exuletur, aut aliquo modo destruatur, nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum> mittemus, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terræ.”The most common translation of these words, at the present day, is as follows:> “No freeman shall be arrested, or imprisoned, or deprived of his freehold, or> his liberties, or free customs, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner> destroyed, nor will we (the king) pass upon him, nor condemn him, unless by> the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.”“NEC SUPER EUM IBIMUS, NEC SUPER EUM MITTEMUS.”There has been much confusion and doubt as to the true meaning of the words,“nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus.” The more common rendering hasbeen, “nor will we pass upon him, nor condemn him.” But some have translatedthem to mean, “nor will we pass upon him, nor commit him to prison.” Coke givesstill a different rendering, to the effect that “No man shall be condemned atthe king’s suit, either before the king in his bench, nor before any othercommissioner or judge whatsoever.”[11]But all these translations are clearly erroneous. In the first place, “nor willwe pass upon him,”—meaning thereby to decide upon his guilt or innocencejudicially—is not a correct rendering of the words, “nec super eum ibimus.”There is nothing whatever, in these latter words, that indicates judicial actionor opinion at all. The words, in their common signification, describe physicalaction alone. And the true translation of them, as will hereafter be seen, is,“nor will we proceed against him,” executively.In the second place, the rendering, “nor will we condemn him,” bears little orno analogy to any common, or even uncommon, signification of the words “necsuper eum mittemus.” There is nothing in these latter words that indicatesjudicial action or decision. Their common signification, like Chat of the wordsnec super eum ibimus, describes physical action alone. “Nor will we send upon(or against) him,” would be the most obvious translation, and, as we shallhereafter see, such is the true translation.But although these words describe physical action, on the part of the king, asdistinguished from judicial, they nevertheless do not mean, as one of thetranslations has it, “nor will we commit him to prison;” for that would be amere repetition of what had been already declared by the words “necimprisonetur.” Besides, there is nothing about prisons in the words “nec supereum mittemus;” nothing about sending kirn anywhere; but only about sending(something or somebody) upon him, or against him—that is, executively.Coke’s rendering is, if possible, the most absurd and gratuitous of all. What isthere in the words, “nec super eum mittemus,” that can be made to mean “norshall he be condemned before any other commissioner or judge whatsoever?”Clearly there is nothing. The whole rendering is a sheer fabrication. And thewhole object of it is to give color for the exercise of a judicial power, by theking, or his judges, which is nowhere given them.Neither the words, “nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus,” nor any otherwords in the whole chapter, authorize, provide for, describe, or suggest, anyjudicial action whatever, on the part either of the king, or of his judges, orof anybody, except the peers, or jury. There is nothing about the king’s judgesat all. And there is nothing whatever, in the whole chapter, so far as relatesto the action of the king, that describes or suggests anything but executiveaction.[12]But that all these translations are certainly erroneous, is proved by atemporary charter, granted by John a short time previous to the Great Charter,for the purpose of giving an opportunity for conference, arbitration, andreconciliation between him and his barons. It was to have force until thematters in controversy between them could be submitted to the Pope, and to otherpersons to be chosen, some by the king, and some by the barons. The words of thecharter are as follows:> “Sciatis nos concessisse barouibus nostris qui contra nos sunt quod nec eos> nec homines suos capiemus, nec disseisiemus nec super eos per vim vel per arma> ibimus nisi per legem regni nostri vel per judicium parium suorum in curia> nostra donee consideratio facta fuerit,” &c., &c.That is, “Know that we have granted to our barons who are opposed to us, that wewill neither arrest them nor their men, nor disseize them, nor will we proceedagainst them by force or by arms, unless by the law of our kingdom, or by thejudgment of their peers in our court, until consideration shall be had,” &c.,&c.A copy of this charter is given in a note in Blackstone’s Introduction to theCharters.[13]Mr. Christian speaks of this charter as settling the true meaning of thecorresponding clause of Magna Carta, on the principle that laws and charters onthe same subject are to be construed with reference to each other. See 3Christian’s Blackstone, 41, note.The true meaning of the words, nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus, isalso proved by the “Articles of the Great Charter of Liberties,” demanded of theking by the barons, and agreed to by the king, under seal, a few days before thedate of the Charter, and from which the Charter was framed.[14] Here the wordsused are these:> “Ne corpus liberi hominis capiatur nec imprisonetur nec disseisetur nec> utlagetur nec exuletur nec aliquo modo destruatur nec rex eat vel mittat super> eum vi nisi per judicium parium suorum vel per legem terræ.”That is, “The body of a freeman shall not be arrested, nor imprisoned, nordisseized, nor outlawed, nor exiled, nor in any manner destroyed, nor shall theking proceed or send (any one) against him with force, unless by the judgment ofhis peers, or the law of the land.”The true translation of the words nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus,in Magna Carta, is thus made certain, as follows, “nor will we (the king)proceed against him, nor send (any one) against him with force or arms.”[15]It is evident that the difference between the true and false translations of thewords, nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus, is of the highest legalimportance, inasmuch as the true translation, nor will we (the king) proceedagainst him, nor send (any one) against him by force or arms, represents theking only in an executive character, carrying the judgment of the peers and “thelaw of the land” into execution; whereas the false translation, nor will we passupon him, nor condemn, him, gives color for the exercise of a judicial power, onthe part of the king, to which the king had no right, but which, according tothe true translation, belongs wholly to the jury.“PER LEGALE JUDICIUM PARIUM SUORUM.”The foregoing interpretation is corroborated, (if it were not already too plainto be susceptible of corroboration,) by the true interpretation of the phrase“per legale judicium parium suorum.”In giving this interpretation, I leave out, for the present, the word legale,which will be defined afterwards.The true meaning of the phrase, per judicium parium suorum, is, according to thesentence of his peers. The word judicium, judgment, has a technical meaning inthe law, signifying the decree rendered in the decision of a cause. In civilsuits this decision is called a judgment; in chancery proceedings it is called adecree; in criminal actions it is called a sentence, or judgment, indifferently.Thus, in a criminal suit, “a motion in arrest of judgment,” means a motion inarrest of sentence.[16]In cases of sentence, therefore, in criminal suits, the words sentence andjudgment are synonymous terms. They are, to this day, commonly used in law booksas synonymous terms. And the phrase per judicium parium suorum, therefore,implies that the jury are to fix the sentence.The word per means according to. Otherwise there is no sense in the phrase perjudicium parium suorum. There would be no sense in saying that a king mightimprison, disseize, outlaw, exile, or otherwise punish a man, or proceed againsthim, or send any one against him, by force or arms, by a judgment of his peers;but there is sense in saying that the king may imprison, disseize, and punish aman, or proceed against him, or send any one against him, by force or arms,according to a judgment, or sentence, of his peers; because in that case theking would be merely carrying the sentence or judgment of the peers intoexecution.The word per, in the phrase “per judicium parium suorum,” of course meansprecisely what it does in the next phrase, “per legem terræ;” where it obviouslymeans according to, and not by, as it is usually translated. There would be nosense in saying that the king might proceed against a man by force or arms, bythe law of the land; but there is sense in saying that he may proceed againsthim, by force or arms, according to the law of the land; because the king wouldthen be acting only as an executive officer, carrying the law of the land intoexecution. Indeed, the true meaning of the word by, as used in similar casesnow, always is according to; as, for example, when we say a thing was done bythe government, or by the executive, by law, we mean only that it was done bythem according to law; that is, that they merely executed the law.Or, if we say that the word by signifies by authority of, the result will stillbe the same; for nothing can be done by authority of law, except what the lawitself authorizes or directs to be done; that is, nothing can be done byauthority of law, except simply to carry the law itself into execution. Sonothing could be done by authority of the sentence of the peers, or by authorityof “the law of the land,” except what the sentence of the peers, or the law ofthe land, themselves authorized or directed to be done; nothing, in short, butto carry the sentence of the peers, or the law of the land, themselves intoexecution.Doing a thing by law, or according to law, is only carrying the law intoexecution. And punishing a man by, or according to, the sentence or judgment ofhis peers, is only carrying that sentence or judgment into execution.If these reasons could leave any doubt that the word per is to be translatedaccording to, that doubt would be removed by the terms of an antecedent guarantyfor the trial by jury, granted by the Emperor Conrad, of Germany,[17] twohundred years before Magna Carta. Blackstone cites it as follows:—(3 Blackstone,350.)“Nemo beneficium suum perdat, nisi secundum consuetudinem antecessorumnostrorum, et judicium parium suorum.” That is, No one shall lose hisestate,[18] unless according to (“secundum”) the custom (or law) of ourancestors, and (according to) the sentence (or judgment) of his peers.The evidence is therefore conclusive that the phrase per judicium parium suorummeans according to the sentence of his peers; thus implying that the jury, andnot the government, are to fix the sentence.If any additional proof were wanted that juries were to fix the sentence, itwould be found in the following provisions of Magna Carta, viz.:> “A freeman shall not be amerced for a small crime, (delicto,) but according to> the degree of the crime; and for a great crime in proportion to the magnitude> of it, saving to him his contenement;[19] and after the same manner a> merchant, saving to him his merchandise. And a villein shall be amerced after> the same manner, saving to him his waynage,[20] if he fall under our mercy;> and none of the aforesaid amercements shall be imposed, (or assessed,> ponatur,) but by the oath of honest men of the neighborhood. Earls and Barons> shall not be amerced but by their peers, and according to the degree of their> crime.”[21]Pecuniary punishments were the most common punishments at that day, and theforegoing provisions of Magna Carta show that the amount of those punishmentswas to be fixed by the jury.Fines went to the king, and were a source of revenue; and if the amounts of thefines had been left to be fixed by the king, he would have had a pecuniarytemptation to impose unreasonable and oppressive ones. So, also, in regard toother punishments than fines. If it were left to the king to fix the punishment,he might often have motives to inflict cruel and oppressive ones. As it was theobject of the trial by jury to protect the people against all possibleoppression from the king, it was necessary that the jury, and not the king,should fix the punishments.[22]“LEGALE.”The word “legale,” in the phrase “per legale judicium parium suorum,” doubtlessmeans two things. 1. That the sentence must be given in a legal manner; that is,by the legal number of jurors, legally empanelled and sworn to try the cause;and that they give their judgment or sentence after a legal trial, both in formand substance, has been had. 2. That the sentence shall be for a legal cause oroffence. If, therefore, a jury should convict and sentence a man, either withoutgiving him a legal trial, or for an act that was not really and legallycriminal, the sentence itself would not be legal; and consequently this clauseforbids the king to carry such a sentence into execution; for the clauseguarantees that he will execute no judgment or sentence, except it be legalejudicium, a legal sentence. Whether a sentence be a legal one, would have to beascertained by the king or his judges, oil appeal, or might be judged ofinformally by the king himself.The word “legale” clearly did not mean that the judicium parium suorum (judgmentof his peers) should be a sentence which any law (of the king) should requirethe peers to pronounce; for in that case the sentence would not be the sentenceof the peers, but only the sentence of the law, (that is, of the king); and thepeers would be only a mouthpiece of the law, (that is, of the king,) in utteringit.“PER LEGEM TERRÆ.”One other phrase remains to be explained, viz., “per legem terræ,” “by the lawof the land.”All writers agree that this means the common law. Thus, Sir Matthew Hale says:> “The common law is sometimes called, by way of eminence, lex terræ, as in the> statute of Magna Carta, chap. 29, where certainly the common law is> principally intended by those words, aut per legem terræ; as appears by the> exposition thereof in several subsequent statutes; and particularly in the> statute of 28 Edward III., chap. 3, which is but an exposition and explanation> of that statute. Sometimes it is called lex Angliæ, as in the statute of> Merton, cap. 9, “Nolumus leges Angliæ mutari,” &c., (We will that the laws of> England be not changed). Sometimes it is called lex et consuetudo regni (the> law and custom of the kingdom); as in all commissions of oyer and terminer;> and in the statutes of 18 Edward I., cap.—, and de quo warranto, and divers> others. But most commonly it is called the Common Law, or the Common Law of> England; as in the statute Articuli super Charters, cap. 15, in the statute 25> Edward III., cap. 5, (4,) and infinite more records and statutes.”—1 Hale’s> History of the Common Law, 128.This common law, or “law of the land,” the king was sworn to maintain. This factis recognized by a statute made at Westminster, in 1346, by Edward III., whichcommences in this manner:> “Edward, by the Grace of God, &c., &c., to the Sheriff of Stafford, Greeting:> Because that by divers complaints made to us, we have perceived that the law> of the land, which we by oath are bound to maintain,” &c.—St. 20 Edward III.The foregoing authorities are cited to show to the unprofessional reader, whatis well known to the profession, that legem terræ, the law of the land,mentioned in Magna Carta, was the common, ancient, fundamental law of the land,which the kings were bound by oath to observe; and that it did not include anystatutes or laws enacted by the king himself, the legislative power of thenation.If the term legem terræ had included laws enacted by the king himself, the wholechapter of Magna Carta, now under discussion, would have amounted to nothing asa protection to liberty; because it would have imposed no restraint whateverupon the power of the king. The king could make laws at any time, and such onesas he pleased. He could, therefore, have done anything he pleased, by the law ofthe land, as well as in any other way, if his own laws had been “the law of theland.” If his own laws had been “the law of the land,” within the meaning ofthat term as used in Magna Carta, this chapter of Magna Carta would have beensheer nonsense, inasmuch as the whole purport of it would have been simply that“no man shall be arrested, imprisoned, or deprived of his freehold, or hisliberties, or free customs, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner destroyed(by the king); nor shall the king proceed against him, nor send any one againsthim with force and arms, unless by the judgment of his peers, or unless the kingshall please to do so.”This chapter of Magna Carta would, therefore, have imposed not the slightestrestraint upon the power of the king, or afforded the slightest protection tothe liberties of the people, if the laws of the king had been embraced in theterm legem terræ. But if legem terræ was the common law, which the king wassworn to maintain, then a real restriction was laid upon his power, and a realguaranty given to the people for their liberties.Such, then, being the meaning of legem terræ, the fact is established that MagnaCarta took an accused person entirely out of the hands of the legislative power,that is, of the king; and placed him in the power and under the protection ofhis peers, and the common law alone; that, in short, Magna Carta suffered no manto be punished for violating any enactment of the legislative power, unless thepeers or equals of the accused freely consented to it, or the common lawauthorized it; that the legislative power, of itself was wholly incompetent torequire the conviction or punishment of a man for any offence whatever.WHETHER MAGNA CARTA ALLOWED OF ANY OTHER TRIAL THAN BY JURY.The question here arises, whether “legem terræ” did not allow of some other modeof trial than that by jury.The answer is, that, at the time of Magna Carta, it is not probable, (for thereasons given in the note,) that legem terræ authorized, in criminal cases, anyother trial than the trial by jury; but, if it did, it certainly authorized nonebut the trial by battle, the trial by ordeal, and the trial by compurgators.These were the only modes of trial, except by jury, that had been known inEngland, in criminal cases, for some centuries previous to Magna Carta. All ofthem had become nearly extinct at the time of Magna Carta, and it is notprobable that they were included in “legem terræ,” as that term is used in thatinstrument. But if they were included in it, they have now been long obsolete,and were such as neither this nor any future age will ever return to.[23] Forall practical purposes of the present day, therefore, it may be asserted thatMagna Carta allows no trial whatever but trial by jury.WHETHER MAGNA CARTA ALLOWED SENTENCE TO BE FIXED OTHERWISE THAN BY THE JURY.Still another question arises on the words legem terræ, viz., whether, in caseswhere the question of guilt was determined by the jury, the amount of punishmentmay not have been fixed by legem terræ, the Common Law, instead of its beingfixed by the jury.I think we have no evidence whatever that, at the time of Magna Carta, or indeedat any other time, lex terræ, the common law, fixed the punishment in caseswhere the question of guilt was tried by a jury; or, indeed, that it did in anyother case. Doubtless certain punishments were common and usual for certainoffences; but I do not think it can be shown that the common law, the lex terræ,which the king was sworn to maintain, required any one specific punishment, orany precise amount of punishment, for any one specific offence. If such a thingbe claimed, it must be shown, for it cannot be presumed. In fact, the contrarymust be presumed, because, in the nature of things, the amount of punishmentproper to be inflicted in any particular case, is a matter requiring theexercise of discretion at the time, in order to adapt it to the moral quality ofthe offence, which is different in each case, varying with the mental and moralconstitutions of the offenders, and the circumstances of temptation orprovocation. And Magna Carta recognizes this principle distinctly, as has beforebeen shown, in providing that freemen, merchants, and villeins, “shall not beamerced for a small crime, but according to the degree of the crime; and for agreat crime in proportion to the magnitude of it;” and that “none of theaforesaid amercements shall be imposed (or assessed) but by the oaths of honestmen of the neighborhood;” and that “earls and barons shall not be amerced but bytheir peers, and according to the quality of the offence.”All this implies that the moral quality of the offence was to be judged of atthe trial, and that the punishment was to be fixed by the discretion of thepeers, or jury, and not by any such unvarying rule as a common law rule wouldbe.I think, therefore, it must be conceded that, in all cases, tried by a jury,Magna Carta intended that the punishment should be fixed by the jury, and not bythe common law, for these several reasons.1. It is uncertain whether the common law fixed the punishment of any offencewhatever.2. The words “per judicium parium suorum,” according to the sentence of hispeers, imply that the jury fixed the sentence in some cases tried by them; andif they fixed the sentence in some cases, it must be presumed they did in all,unless the contrary be clearly shown.3. The express provisions of Magna Carta, before adverted to, that noamercements, or fines, should be imposed upon freemen, merchants, or villeins,“but by the oath of honest men of the neighborhood,” and “according to thedegree of the crime,” and that “earls and barons should not be amerced but bytheir peers, and according to the quality of the offence,” proves that, atleast, there was no common law fixing the amount of fines, or, if there were,that it was to be no longer in force. And if there was no common law fixing theamount of fines, or if it was to be no longer in force, it is reasonable toinfer, (in the absence of all evidence to the contrary,) either that the commonlaw did not fix the amount of any other punishment, or that it was to be nolonger in force for that purpose.[24]Under the Saxon laws, fines, payable to the injured party, seem to have been thecommon punishments for all offences. Even murder was punishable by a finepayable to the relatives of the deceased. The murder of the king even waspunishable by fine. When a criminal was unable to pay his fine, his relativesoften paid it for him. But if it were not paid, he was put out of the protectionof the law, and the injured parties, (or, in the case of murder, the kindred ofthe deceased,) were allowed to inflict such punishment as they pleased. And ifthe relatives of the criminal protected him, it was lawful to take vengeance onthem also. Afterwards the custom grew up of exacting fines also to the king as apunishment for offences.[25] And this latter was, doubtless, the usualpunishment at the time of Magna Carta, as is evidenced by the fact that for manyyears immediately following Magna Carta, nearly or quite all statutes thatprescribed any punishment at all, prescribed that the offender should “begrievously amerced,” or “pay a great fine to the king,” or a “grievousransom,”—with the alternative in some cases (perhaps understood in all) ofimprisonment, banishment, or outlawry, in case of non-payment.[26]Judging, therefore, from the special provisions in Magna Carta, requiring fines,or amercements, to be imposed only by juries, (without mentioning any otherpunishments;) judging, also, from the statutes which immediately followed MagnaCarta, it is probable that the Saxon custom of punishing all, or nearly ail,offences by fines, (with the alternative to the criminal of being imprisoned,banished, or outlawed, and exposed to private vengeance, in case ofnon-payment,) continued until the time of Magna Carta; and that in providingexpressly that fines should be fixed by the juries, Magna Carta provided fornearly or quite all the punishments that were expected to be inflicted; that ifthere were to be any others, they were to be fixed by the juries; andconsequently that nothing was left to be fixed by “legem terræ.”But whether the common law fixed the punishment of any offences, or not, is amatter of little or no practical importance at this day; because we have no ideaof going back to any common law punishments of six hundred years ago, if,indeed, there were any such at that time. It is enough for us to know—and thisis what it is material for us to know—that the jury fixed the punishments, inall cases, unless they were fixed by the common law; that Magna Carta allowed nopunishments to be prescribed by statute—that is, by the legislative power—nor inany other manner by the king, or his judges, in any case whatever; and,consequently, that all statutes prescribing particular punishments forparticular offences, or giving the king’s judges any authority to fixpunishments, were void.If the power to fix punishments had been left in the hands of the king, it wouldhave given him a power of oppression, which was liable to be greatly abused;which there was no occasion to leave with him; and which would have beenincongruous with the whole object of this chapter of Magna Carta; which objectwas to take all discretionary or arbitrary power over individuals entirely outof the hands of the king, and his laws, and entrust it only to the common law,and the peers, or jury—that is, the people.WHAT LEX TERRÆ DID AUTHORIZE.But here the question arises, What then did “legem terræ” authorize the king,(that is, the government,) to do in the case of an accused person, if it neitherauthorized any other trial than that by jury, nor any other punishments thanthose fixed by juries?The answer is, that, owing to the darkness of history on the point, it isprobably wholly impossible, at this day, to state, with any certainty orprecision, anything whatever that the legem terræ of Magna Carta did authorizethe king, (that is, the government,) to do, (if, indeed, it authorized him to doanything,) in the case of criminals, other than to have them tried and sentencedby their peers, for common law crimes; and to carry that sentence intoexecution.The trial by jury was a part of legem terræ, and we have the means of knowingwhat the trial by jury was. The fact that the jury were to fix the sentence,implies that they were to try the accused; otherwise they could not know whatsentence, or whether any sentence, ought to be inflicted upon him. Hence itfollows that the jury were to judge of everything involved in the trial; thatis, they were to judge of the nature of the offence, of the admissibility andweight of testimony, and of everything else whatsoever that was of the essenceof the trial. If anything whatever could be dictated to them, either of law orevidence, the sentence would not be theirs, but would be dictated to them by thepower that dictated to them the law or evidence. The trial and sentence, then,were wholly in the hands of the jury.We also have sufficient evidence of the nature of the oath administered tojurors in criminal cases. It was simply, that they would neither convict theinnocent. nor acquit the guilty. This was the oath in the Saxon times, andprobably continued to be until Magna Carta.We also know that, in case of conviction, the sentence of the jury was notnecessarily final; that the accused had the right of appeal to the king and hisjudges, and to demand either a new trial, or an acquittal, if the trial orconviction had been against law.So much, therefore, of the legem terræ of Magna Carta, we know with reasonablecertainty.We also know that Magna Carta provides that “No bailiff (balivus) shallhereafter put any man to his law, (put him on trial,) on his single testimony,without credible witnesses brought to support it.” Coke thinks “that under thisword balivus, in this act, is comprehended every justice, minister of the king,steward of the king, steward and bailiff.” (2 Inst. 44.) And in support of thisidea he quotes from a very ancient law book, called the Mirror of Justices,written in the time of Edward I., within a century after Magna Carta. Butwhether this were really a common law principle, or whether the provision grewout of that jealousy of the government which, at the time of Magna Carta, hadreached its height, cannot perhaps now be determined.We also know that, by Magna Carta, amercements, or fines, could not be imposedto the ruin of the criminal; that, in the case of a freeman, his contenement, ormeans of subsisting in the condition of a freeman, must be saved to him; that,in the case of a merchant, his merchandise must be spared; and in the case of avillein, his waynage, or plough-tackle and carts. This also is likely to havebeen a principle of the common law, inasmuch as, in that rude age, when themeans of getting employment as laborers were not what they are now, the man andhis family would probably have been liable to starvation, if these means ofsubsistence had been taken from him.We also know, generally, that, at the time of Magna Carta, all actsintrinsically criminal, all trespasses against persons and property, werecrimes, according to lex terræ, or the common law.Beyond the points now given, we hardly know anything, probably nothing withcertainty, as to what the “legem terræ” of Magna Carta did authorize, in regardto crimes. There is hardly anything extant that can give us any real light onthe subject.It would seem, however, that there were, even at that day, some common lawprinciples governing arrests; and some common law forms and rules as to holdinga man for trial, (by bail or imprisonment;) putting him on trial, such as byindictment or complaint; summoning and empanelling jurors, &c., &c. Whateverthese common law principles were, Magna Carta requires them to be observed; forMagna Carta provides for the whole proceedings, commencing with the arrest, (“nofreeman shall be arrested” &c.,) and ending with the execution of the sentence.And it provides that nothing shall be done, by the government, from beginning toend, unless according to the sentence of the peers, or “legem terræ,” the commonlaw. The trial by peers was a part of legem terræ, and we have seen that thepeers must necessarily have governed the whole proceedings at the trial. But allthe proceedings for arresting the man, and bringing him to trial, must have beenhad before the case could come under the cognizance of the peers, and they must,therefore, have been governed by other rules than the discretion of the peers.We may conjecture, although we cannot perhaps know with much certainty, that thelex terræ, or common law, governing these other proceedings, was somewhatsimilar to the common law principles, on the same points, at the present day.Such seem to be the opinions of Coke, who says that the phrase nisi per legemterræ means unless by due process of law.Thus, he says:> “Nisi per legem terræ. But by the law of the land. For the true sense and> exposition of these words, see the statute of 37 Edw. III., cap. 8, where the> words, by the law of the land, are rendered without due process of law; for> there it is said, though it be contained in the Great Charter, that no man be> taken, imprisoned, or put out of his freehold, without process of the law;> that is, by indictment or presentment of good and lawful men, where such deeds> be done in due manner, or by writ original of the common law.> > “Without being brought in to answer but by due process of the common law.> > “No man be put to answer without presentment before justices, or thing of> record, or by due process, or by writ original, according to the old law of> the land.”—2 Inst. 50.The foregoing interpretations of the words nisi per legem terræ are corroboratedby the following statutes, enacted in the next century after Magna Carta.> “That no man, from henceforth, shall be attached by any accusation, nor> forejudged of life or limb, nor his land, tenements, goods, nor chattels,> seized into the king’s hands, against the form of the Great Charter, and the> law of the land.”—St. 5 Edward III., Ch. 9. (1331.)> “Whereas it is contained in the Great Charter of the franchises of England,> that none shall be imprisoned, nor put out of his freehold, nor of his> franchises, nor free customs, unless it be by the law of the land: it is> accorded, assented, and established, that from henceforth none shall be taken> by petition, or suggestion made to our lord the king, or to his council,> unless it be by indictment or presentment of good and lawful people of the> same neighborhood where such deeds be done in due manner, or by process made> by writ original at the common law; nor that none be put out of his> franchises, nor of his freehold, unless he be duly brought into answer, and> forejudged of the same by the course of the law; and if anything be done> against the same, it shall be redressed and holden for none.”—St. 25 Edward> III., Ch. 4. (1350.)> “That no man, of what estate or condition that he be, shall be put out of land> or tenement, nor taken, nor imprisoned, nor disinherited, nor put to death,> without being brought in answer by due process of law.”—St. 28 Edward III.,> Ch. 3. (1354.)> “That no man be put to answer without presentment before justices, or matter> of record, or by due process and writ original, according to the old law of> the land. And if anything from henceforth be done to the contrary, it shall be> void in law, and holden for error.”—St. 42 Edward III., Ch. 3. (1368.)The foregoing interpretation of the words nisi per legem terræ—that is, by dueprocess of law—including indictment, &c., has been adopted as the true one bymodern writers and courts; as, for example, by Kent, (2 Comm. 13,) Story, (3Comm. 661,) and the Supreme Court of New York, (19 Wendell, 676; 4 Hill, 146.)The fifth amendment to the constitution of the United States seems to have beenframed on the same idea, inasmuch as it provides that “no person shall bedeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”[27]WHETHER THE WORD VEL SHOULD BE RENDERED BY OR, OR BY AND.Having thus given the meanings, or rather the applications, which the words velper legem terræ will reasonably, and perhaps must necessarily, bear, it isproper to suggest, that it has been supposed by some that the word vel, insteadof being rendered by or, as it usually is, ought to be rendered by and, inasmuchas the word vel is often used for et, and the whole phrase nisi per judiciumparium suorum, vel per legem terræ, (which would then read, unless by thesentence of his peers, and the law of the land,) would convey a moreintelligible and harmonious meaning than it otherwise does.Blackstone suggests that this may be the true reading. (Charters, p. 41.) AlsoMr. Hallam, who says:> “Nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terræ. Several> explanations have been offered of the alternative clause; which some have> referred to judgment by default, or demurrer; others to the process of> attachment for contempt. Certainly there are many legal procedures besides> trial by jury, through which a party’s goods or person may be taken. But one> may doubt whether these were in contemplation of the framers of Magna Carta.> In an entry of the Charter of 1217 by a contemporary hand, preserved in the> Town-clerk’s office in London, called Liber Custumarum et Regum antiquarum, a> various reading, et per legem terræ, occurs. Blackstone’s Charters, p. 42> (41.) And the word vel is so frequently used for et, that I am not wholly free> from a suspicion that it was so intended in this place. The meaning will be,> that no person shall be disseized, &c., except upon a lawful cause of action,> found by the verdict of a jury. This really seems as good as any of the> disjunctive interpretations; but I do not offer it with much confidence.”—2> Hallam’s Middle Ages, Ch. 8, Part 2, p. 449, note.[28]The idea that the word vel should be rendered by and, is corroborated, if notabsolutely confirmed, by the following passage in Blackstone, which has beforebeen cited. Speaking of the trial by jury, as established by Magna Carta, hecalls it,> “A privilege which is couched in almost the same words with that of the> Emperor Conrad two hundred years before: ‘nemo beneficium suum perdat, nisi> secundum consuetudinem antecessorum nostrorum, et judicium parium suorum.’”> (No one shall lose his estate unless according to the custom of our ancestors,> and the judgment of his peers.)—3 Blackstone, 350.If the word vel be rendered by and, (as I think it must be, at least in somecases,) this chapter of Magna Carta will then read that no freeman shall bearrested or punished, “unless according to the sentence of his peers, and thelaw of the land.”The difference between this reading and the other is important. In the one case,there would be, at first view, some color of ground for saying that a man mightbe punished in either of two ways, viz., according to the sentence of his peers,or according to the law of the land. In the other case, it requires both thesentence of his peers and the law of the land (common law) to authorize hispunishment.If this latter reading be adopted, the provision would seem to exclude alltrials except trial by jury, and all causes of action except those of the commonlaw.But I apprehend the word vel must be rendered both by and, and by or; that incases of a judgment, it should be rendered by and, so as to require theconcurrence both of “the judgment of the peers and the law of the land,” toauthorize the king to make execution upon a party’s goods or person; but that incases of arrest and imprisonment, simply for the purpose of bringing a man totrial, vel should be rendered by or, because there can have been no judgment ofa jury in such a case, and “the law of the land” must therefore necessarily bethe only guide to, and restraint upon, the king. If this guide and restraintwere taken away, the king would be invested with an arbitrary and most dangerouspower in making arrests, and confining in prison, under pretence of an intentionto bring to trial.Having thus examined the language of this chapter of Magna Carta, so far as itrelates to criminal cases, its legal import may be stated as follows, viz.:No freeman shall be arrested, or imprisoned, or deprived of his freehold, or hisliberties, or free customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or in any mannerdestroyed, (harmed,) nor will we (the king) proceed against him, nor send” anyone against him, by force or arms, unless according to (that is, in executionof) the sentence of his peers, and (or or, as the case may require) the CommonLaw of England, (as it was at the time of Magna Carta, in 1215.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] 1 Hume, Appendix 2.[2] Crabbe’s History of the English Law, 236.[3] Coke says, “The king of England is armed with divers councils, one whereofis called commune concilium, (the common council,) and that is the court ofparliament, and so it is legally called in write and judicial proceedingscommune concilium regni Angliæ, (the common council of the kingdom of England.)And another is called magnum concilium, (great council;) this is sometimesapplied to the upper house of parliament, and sometimes, out of parliament time,to the peers of the realm, lords of parliament, who are called magnum conciliumregis, (the great council of the king;) * * Thirdly, (as every man knoweth,) theking hath a privy council for matters of state. * * The fourth council of theking are his judges for law matters.”—1 Coke’s Institutes, 110 a.[4] The Great Charter of Henry III., (1216 and 1225,) confirmed by Edward I.,(1297,) makes no provision whatever for, or mention of, a parliament, unless theprovision, (Ch. 37,) that “Escuage, (a military contribution,) from henceforthshall be taken like as it was wont to be in the time of King Henry ourgrandfather,” mean that a parliament shall be summoned for that purpose.[5] The Magna Carta of John, (Ch. 17 and 18,) defines those who were entitled tobe summoned to parliament, to wit, “The Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Earls, andGreat Barons of the Realm, * * and all others who hold of us in chief.” Thosewho held land of the king in chief included none below the rank of knights.[6] The parliaments of that time were, doubtless, such as Carlyle describesthem, when he says, “The parliament was at first a most simple assemblage, quitecognate to the situation; that Red William, or whoever had taken on him theterrible task of being King of England, was wont to invite, oftenest aboutChristmas time, his subordinate Kinglets, Barons as he called them, to give himthe pleasure of their company for a week or two; there, in earnest conferenceall morning, in freer talk over Christinas cheer all evening, in some big royalhall of Westminster, Winchester, or wherever it might be, with log fires, hugerounds of roast and boiled, not lacking malmsey and other generous liquor, theytook counsel concerning the arduous matters of the kingdom.”[7] Hume, Appendix 2.[8] This point will be more fully established hereafter.[9] It is plain that the king and all his partisans looked upon the charter asutterly prostrating the king’s legislative supremacy before the discretion ofjuries. When the schedule of liberties demanded by the barons was shown to him,(of which the trial by jury was the most important, because it was the only onethat protected all the rest,) “the king, falling into a violent passion, asked,Why the barons did not with these exactions demand his kingdom? * * and with asolemn oath protested, that he would never grant such liberties as would makehimself a slave.” * * But afterwards, “seeing himself deserted, and fearing theywould seize his castles, he sent the Earl of Pembroke and other faithfulmessengers to them, to let them know he would grant them the laws and libertiesthey desired.” * * But after the charter had been granted, “the king’s mercenarysoldiers, desiring war more than peace, were by their leaders continuallywhispering in his ears, that he was now no longer king, but the scorn of otherprinces; and that it was more eligible to be no king, than such a one as he.” ** He applied “to the Pope, that he might by his apostolic authority make voidwhat the barons had done. * * At Rome he met with what success he could desire,where all the transactions with the barons were fully represented to the Pope,and the Charter of liberties shown to him, in writing; which, when he badcarefully perused, he, with a furious look, cried out, What! Do the barons ofEngland endeavor to dethrone a king, who has taken upon him the Holy Cross, andis under the protection of the Apostolic See; and would they force him totransfer the dominions of the Roman Church to others? By St. Peter, this injurymust not pass unpunished. Then debating the matter with the cardinals, he, by adefinitive sentence, damned and cassated forever the Charter of Liberties, andsent the king a bull containing that sentence at large.”—Echard’s History ofEngland, p. 106–7.These things show that the nature and effect of the charter were well understoodby the king and his friends; that they all agreed that he was effectuallystripped of power. Yet the legislative power had not been taken from him; butonly the power to enforce his laws, unless juries should freely consent to theirenforcement.[10] The laws were, at that time, all written in Latin.[11] “No man shall be condemned at the king’s suit, either before the king inhis bench, where pleas are coram rege, (before the king,) (and so are the wordsnec super eum ibimus, to be understood,) nor before any other commissioner orjudge whatsoever, and so are the words nec super eum mittemus, to be understood,but by the judgment of his peers, that is, equals, or according to the law ofthe land.”—2 Coke’s Inst., 46.[12] Perhaps the assertion in the text should be made with thisqualification—that the words “per legem terræ,” (according to the law of theland,) and the words “per legale judicium parium suorum,” (according to thelegal judgment of his peers,) imply that the king, before proceeding to anyexecutive action, will take notice of “the law of the land,” and of the legalityof the judgment of the peers, and will execute upon the prisoner nothing exceptwhat the law of the land authorizes, and no judgments of the peers, except legalones. With this qualification, the assertion in the text is strictlycorrect—that there is nothing in the whole chapter that grants to the king, orhis judges, any judicial power at all. The chapter only describes and limits hisexecutive power.[13] See Blackstone’s Law Tracts, page 294, Oxford Edition.[14] These Articles of the Charter are given in Blackstone’s collection ofCharters, and are also printed with the Statutes of the Realm. Also in Wilkins’Laws of the Anglo-Saxons, p. 356.[15] Lingard says, “The words, ‘We will not destroy him, nor will we go uponhim, nor will we send upon him,’ have been very differently expounded bydifferent legal authorities. Their real meaning may be learned from Johnhimself, who the next year promised by his letters patent . . . nec super eosper vim vel per arma ibimus, nisi per legem regni nostri, vel per judiciumparium suorum in curia nostra, (nor will we go upon them by force or by arms,unless by the law of our kingdom, or the judgment of their peers in our court.)Pat. 16 Johan, apud Drad. 11, app. no. 124, He had hitherto been in the habit ofgoing with an armed force, or sending an armed force on the lands, and againstthe castles, of all whom he knew or suspected to be his secret enemies, withoutobserving any form of law.”—3 Lingard, 47 note.[16] “Judgment, judicium. * * The sentence of the law, pronounced by the court,upon the matter contained in the record.”—3 Blackstone, 395. Jacob’s LawDictionary. Tomlin’s do.“Judgment is the decision or sentence of the law, given by a court of justice orother competent tribunal, as the result of the proceedings instituted therein,for the redress of an injury.”—Bouvier’s Law Dict.“Judgment, judicium. * * Sentence of a judge against a criminal. * *Determination, decision in general.”—Bailey’s Dict.“Judgment. * * In a legal sense, a sentence or decision pronounced by authorityof a king, or other power, either by their own mouth, or by that of their judgesand officers, whom they appoint to administer justice in their stead.”—Chambers’Dict.“Judgment. * * In law, the sentence or doom pronounced in any case, civil orcriminal, by the judge or court by which it is tried.”—Webster’s Dict.Sometimes the punishment itself is called judicium, judgment; or, rather, it wasat the time of Magna Carta. For example, in a statute passed fifty-one yearsafter Magna Carta, it was said that a baker, for default in the weight of hisbread, “debeat amerciari vel subire judicium pillorie;” that is, ought to beamerced, or suffer the punishment, or judgment, of the pillory. Also that abrewer, for “selling ale contrary to the assise,” “debeat amereiari, vel patijudicium tumbrelli”; that is, ought to be amerced, or suffer the punishment, orjudgment, of the tumbrel.—51 Henry 3, St. 6. (1266.)Also the “Statutes of uncertain date,” (but supposed to be prior to Edward III.,or 1326,) provide, in chapters 6, 7, and 10, for “judgment of the pillory.”—See1 Ruffhead’s Statutes, 187, 188. 1 Statutes of the Realm, 203.Blackstone, in his chapter “Of Judgment, and its Consequences,” says,“Judgment (unless any matter be offered in arrest thereof) follows uponconviction; being the pronouncing of that punishment which is expressly ordainedby law.”—Blackstone’s Analysis of the Laws of England, Book 4, Ch. 29, Sec. 1.Blackstone’s Law Tracts, 126.Coke says, “Judicium . . the judgment is the guide and direction of theexecution.”—3 Inst. 210.[17] This precedent from Germany is good authority, because the trial by jurywas in use, in the northern nations of Europe generally, long before MagnaCarta, and probably from time immemorial; and the Saxons and Normans werefamiliar with it before they settled in England.[18] Beneficium was the legal name of an estate held by a feudal tenure. SeeSpelman’s Glossary.[19] Contentment of a freeman was the means of living in the condition of afreeman.[20] Waynage was a villein’s plough-tackle and carts.[21] Tomlin says, “The ancient practice was, when any such fine was imposed, toinquire by a jury quantum inde regi dare valeat per annum, salva sustentationesua et uxoris et liberorum suorum, (how much is he able to give to the king perannum, saving his own maintenance, and that of his wife and children). And sincethe disuse of such inquest, it is never usual to assess a larger fine than a manis able to pay, without touching the implements of his livelihood; but toinflict corporal punishment, or a limited imprisonment, instead of such a fineas might amount to imprisonment for life. And this is the reason why fines inthe king’s courts are frequently denominated ransoms, because the penalty mustotherwise fall upon a man’s person, unless it be redeemed or ransomed by apecuniary fine.”—Tomlin’s Law Dict., word Fine.[22] Because juries were to fix the sentence, it must not be supposed that theking was obliged to carry the sentence into execution; but only that he couldnot go beyond the sentence. He might pardon, or he might acquit on grounds oflaw, notwithstanding the sentence; but he could not punish beyond the extent ofthe sentence. Magna Carta does not prescribe that the king shall punishaccording to the sentence of the peers; but only that he shall not punish“unless according to” that sentence. He may acquit or pardon, notwithstandingtheir sentence or judgment; but he cannot punish, except according to theirjudgment.[23] The trial by battle was one in which the accused challenged his accuser tosingle combat, and staked the question of his guilt or innocence on the resultof the duel. This trial was introduced into England by the Normans, within onehundred and fifty years before Magna Carta. It was not very often resorted toeven by the Normans themselves; probably never by the Anglo-Saxons, unless intheir controversies with the Normans. It was strongly discouraged by some of theNorman princes, particularly by Henry II., by whom the trial by jury wasespecially favored. It is probable that the trial by battle, so far as itprevailed at all in England, was rather tolerated as a matter of chivalry, thanauthorized as a matter of law. At any rate, it is not likely that it wasincluded in the “legem terræ” of Magna Carta, although such duels haveoccasionally occurred since that time, and have, by some, been supposed to belawful. I apprehend that nothing can be properly said to be a part of lex terræ,unless it can be shown either to have been of Saxon origin, or to have beenrecognized by Magna Carta.The trial by ordeal was of various kinds. In one ordeal the accused was requiredto take hot iron in his hand; in another to walk blindfold among red-hotploughshares; in another to thrust his arm into boiling water; in another to bethrown, with his hands and feet bound, into cold water; in another to swallowthe morsel of execration; in the confidence that his guilt or innocence would bemiraculously made known. This mode of trial was nearly extinct at the time ofMagna Carta, and it is not likely that it was included in “legem terræ,” as thatterm is used in that instrument. This idea is corroborated by the fact that thetrial by ordeal was specially prohibited only four years after Magna Carta, “byact of Parliament in 3 Henry III., according to Sir Edward Coke, or rather by anorder of the king in council.”—3 Blackstone 345, note.I apprehend that this trial was never forced upon accused persons, but was onlyallowed to them, as an appeal to God, from the judgment of a jury.[23a]The trial by compurgators was one in which, if the accused could bring twelve ofhis neighbors, who would make oath that they believed him innocent. he was heldto be so. It is probable that this trial was really the trial by jury, or wasallowed as an appeal from a jury. It is wholly improbable that two differentmodes of trial, so nearly resembling each other as this and the trial by jurydo, should prevail at the same time, and among a rude people, whose judicialproceedings would naturally be of the simplest kind. But if this trial reallywere any other than the trial by jury, it must have been nearly or quite extinctat the time of Magna Carta; and there is no probability that it was included in“legem terræ.”[23a] Hallam says, “It appears as if the ordeal were permitted to personsalready convicted by the verdict of a jury.”—2 Middle Ages, 446, note.[24] Coke attempts to show that there is a distinction between amercements andfines—admitting that amercements must be fixed by one’s peers, but claiming thatfines may be fixed by the government. (2 Inst. 27, 8 Coke’s Reports 38.) Butthere seems to have been no ground whatever for supposing that any suchdistinction existed at the time of Magna Carta. If there were any suchdistinction in the time of Coke, it had doubtless grown up within the fourcenturies that had elapsed since Magna Carta, and is to be set down as one ofthe numberless inventions of government for getting rid of the restraints ofMagna Carta, and for taking men out of the protection of their peers, andsubjecting them to such punishments as the government chooses to inflict.The first statute of Westminster, passed sixty years after Magna Carta, treatsthe fine and amercement as synonymous, as follows:“Forasmuch as the common fine and amercement of the whole county in Eyre of thejustices for false judgments, or for other trespass, is unjustly assessed bysheriffs and baretors in the shires, * * it is provided, and the king wills,that from henceforth such sums shall be assessed before the justices in Eyre,afore their departure, by the oath of knights and other honest men,” Ac.—3Edward I., Ch. 18. (1275.)And in many other statutes passed after Magna Carta, the terms fine andamercement seem to be used indifferently, in prescribing the punishments foroffences. As late as 1461, (246 years after Magna Carta,) the statute 1 EdwardIV., Ch. 2, speaks of “fines, ransoms, and amerciaments” as being levied uponcriminals, as if they were the common punishments of offences.St. 2 and 3 Philip and Mary, Ch. 8, uses the terms, “fines, forfeitures, andamerciaments” five times. (1555.)St. 5 Elizabeth, Ch. 13, Sec. 10, uses the terms “fines, forfeitures, andamerciament.”That amercements were fines, or pecuniary punishments, inflicted for offences,is proved by the following statutes, (all supposed to have been passed withinone hundred and fifteen years after Magna Carta,) which speak of amercements asa species of “judgment,” or punishment, and as being inflicted for the sameoffences as other “judgments.”Thus one statute declares that a baker, for default in the weight of his bread,“ought to be amerced, or suffer the judgment of the pillory;” and that a brewer,for “selling ale contrary to the assize,” “ought to be amerced, or suffer thejudgment of the tumbrel.”—51 Henry III., St. 6. (1266.)Among the “Statutes of Uncertain Date,” but supposed to be prior to Edward III.,(1326,) are the following:Chap. 6 provides that “if a brewer break the assize, (fixing the price of ale,)the first, second, and third time, he shall be amerced; but the fourth time heshall suffer judgment of the pillory without redemption.”Chap. 7 provides that “a butcher that selleth swine’s flesh measled, or fleshdead of the murrain, or that buyeth flesh of Jews, and selleth the same untoChristians, after he shall be convict thereof, for the first time he shall begrievously amerced; the second time he shall suffer judgment of the pillory; andthe third time he shall be imprisoned and make fine; and the fourth time heshall forswear the town.”Chap. 10, a statute against forestalling, provides that,“He that is convict thereof, the first time shall be amerced, and shall lose thething so bought, and that according to the custom of the town; he that isconvicted the second time shall have judgment of the pillory; at the third timehe shall be imprisoned and make fine; the fourth time he shall abjure the town.And this judgment shall be given upon all manner of forestallers, and likewiseupon them that have given them counsel, help, or favor.”—1 Ruffhead’s Statutes,187, 188. 1 Statutes of the Realm, 203.[25] 1 Hume, Appendix, 1.[26] Blackstone says, “Our ancient Saxon laws nominally punished theft withdeath, if above the value of twelve pence; but the criminal was permitted toredeem his life by a pecuniary ransom, as among their ancestors, the Germans, bya stated number of cattle. But in the ninth year of Henry the First, (1109,)this power of redemption was taken away, and all persons guilty of larceny abovethe value of twelve pence were directed to be hanged, which law continues inforce to this day.”—4 Blackstone, 238.I give this statement of Blackstone, because the latter clause may seem tomilitate with the idea, which the former clause corroborates, viz., that at thetime of Magna Carta, fines were the usual punishments of offences. But I thinkthere is no probability that a law so unreasonable in itself (unreasonable evenafter making all allowance for the difference in the value of money,) and socontrary to immemorial custom, could or did obtain any general or speedyacquiescence among a people who cared little for the authority of kings.Maddox, writing of the period from William the Conqueror to John, says:> “The amercements in criminal and common pleas, which were wont to be imposed> during this first period and afterwards, were of so many several sorts, that> it is not easy to place them under distinct heads. Let them, for method’s> sake, be reduced to the heads following: Amercements for or by reason of> murders and manslaughters, for misdemeanors, for disseisins, for recreancy,> for breach of assize, for defaults, for nonappearance, for false judgment, and> for not making suit, or hue and cry. To them may be added miscellaneous> amercements, for trespasses of divers kinds.”—1 Maddox’ History of the> Exchequer, 542.[27] Coke, in his exposition of the words legem terræ, gives quite in detail theprinciples of the common law governing arrests; and takes it for granted thatthe words “nisi per legem terræ” are applicable to arrests, as well as to theindictment, &c.—2 Inst., 51, 52.[28] I cite the above extract from Mr. Hallam solely for the sake of hisauthority for rendering the word vel by and; and not by any means for thepurpose of indorsing the opinion he suggests, that legem terræ authorized“judgments by default or demurrer,” without the intervention of a jury. He seemsto imagine that lex terræ, the common law, at the time of Magna Carta, includedeverything, even to the practice of courts, that is, at this day, called by thename of Common Law; whereas much of what is now called Common Law has grown up,by usurpation, since the time of Magna Carta, in palpable violation of theauthority of that charter. He says, “Certainly there are many legal procedures,besides trial by jury, through which a party’s goods or person may be taken.” Ofcourse there are now many such ways, in which a party’s goods or person aretaken, besides by the judgment of a jury; but the question is, whether suchtakings are not in violation of Magna Carta.He seems to think that, in cases of “judgment by default or demurrer,” there isno need of a jury, and thence to infer that legem terræ may not have required ajury in those cases. But this opinion is founded on the erroneous idea thatjuries are required only for determining contested facts, and not for judging ofthe law. In case of default, the plaintiff must present a prima facie casebefore he is entitled to a judgment; and Magna Carta, (supposing it to require ajury trial in civil cases, as Mr. Hallam assumes that it does,) as much requiresthat this prima facie case, both law and fact, be made out to the satisfactionof a jury, as it does that a contested case shall be.As for a demurrer, the jury must try a demurrer (having the advice andassistance of the court, of course) as much as any other matter of law arisingin a case.Mr. Hallam evidently thinks there is no use for a jury, except where there is a“trial”—meaning thereby a contest on matters of fact. His language is, that“there are many legal procedures, besides trial by jury, through which a party’sgoods or person may be taken.” Now Magna Carta says nothing of trial by jury;but only of the judgment, or sentence, of a jury. It is only by inference thatwe come to the conclusion that there must be a trial by jury. Since the juryalone can give the judgment, or sentence, we infer that they must try the case;because otherwise they would be incompetent, and would have no moral right, togive judgment. They must, therefore, examine the grounds, (both of law andfact,) or rather try the grounds, of every action whatsoever, whether it bedecided on “default, demurrer,” or otherwise, and render their judgment, orsentence, thereon, before any judgment can be a legal one, on which “to take aparty’s goods or person.” In short, the principle of Magna Carta is, that nojudgment can be valid against a party’s goods or person, (not even a judgmentfor costs,) except a judgment rendered by a jury. Of course a jury must tryevery question, both of law and fact, that is involved in the rendering of thatjudgment. They are to have the assistance and advice of the judges, so far asthey desire them; but the judgment itself must be theirs, and not the judgmentof the court.As to “process of attachment for contempt,” it is of course lawful for a judge,in his character of a peace officer, to issue a warrant for the arrest of a manguilty of a contempt, as he would for the arrest of any other offender, and holdhim to bail, (or, in default of bail, commit him to prison,) to answer for hisoffence before a jury. Or he may order him into custody without a warrant whenthe offence is committed in the judge’s presence. But there is no reason why ajudge should have the power of punishing for contempt, any more than for anyother offence. And it is one of the most dangerous powers a judge can have,because it gives him absolute authority in a court of justice, and enables himto tyrannize as he pleases over parties, counsel, witnesses, and jurors. If ajudge have power to punish for contempt, and to determine for himself what is acontempt, the whole administration of justice (or injustice, if he choose tomake it so) is in his hands. And all the rights of jurors, witnesses, counsel,and parties, are held subject to his pleasure, and can be exercised onlyagreeably to his will. He can of course control the entire proceedings in, andconsequently the decision of, every cause, by restraining and punishing everyone, whether party, counsel, witness, or juror, who presumes to offer anythingcontrary to his pleasure.This arbitrary power, which has been usurped and exercised by judges to punishfor contempt, has undoubtedly had much to do in subduing counsel into thoseservile, obsequious, and cowardly habits, which so universally prevail amongthem, and which have not only cost so many clients their rights, but have alsocost the people so many of their liberties.If any summary punishment for contempt be ever necessary, (as it probably isnot,) beyond exclusion for the time being from the court-room, (which should bedone, not as a punishment, but for self-protection, and the preservation oforder,) the judgment for it should be given by the jury, (where the trial isbefore a jury,) and not by the court, for the jury, and not the court, arereally the judges. For the same reason, exclusion from the court-room should beordered only by the jury, in cases when the trial is before a jury, becausethey, being the real judges and triers of the cause, are entitled, if anybody,to the control of the court-room. In appeal courts, where no juries sit, it maybe necessary—not as a punishment, but for self-protection, and the maintenanceof order—that the court should exercise the power of excluding a person, for thetime being, from the court-room; but there is no reason why they should proceedto sentence him as a criminal, without his being tried by a jury.If the people wish to have their rights respected and protected in courts ofjustice, it is manifestly of the last importance that they jealously guard theliberty of parties, counsel, witnesses, and jurors, against all arbitrary poweron the part of the court.Certainly Mr. Hallam may very well say that “one may doubt whether these (theseveral cases he has mentioned) were in contemplation of the framers of MagnaCarta”—that is, as exceptions to the rule requiring that all judgments, that areto be enforced “against a party’s goods or person,” be rendered by a jury.Again, Mr. Hallam says, if the word vel be rendered by and, “the meaning willbe, that no person shall be disseized, &c., except upon a lawful cause ofaction.” This is true; but it does not follow that any cause of action, foundedon statute only, is therefore a “lawful cause of action,” within the meaning oflegem terræ, or the Common Law. Within the meaning of the legem terræ of MagnaCarta, nothing but a common law cause of action is a “lawful” one."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER III.ADDITIONAL PROOFS OF THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF JURORS.If any evidence, extraneous to the history and language of Magna Carta, wereneeded to prove that, by that chapter which guaranties the trial by jury, allwas meant that has now been ascribed to it, and that the legislation of the kingwas to be of no authority with the jury beyond what they chose to allow to it,and that the juries were to limit the punishments to be inflicted, we shouldfind that evidence in various sources, such as the laws, customs, and charactersof their ancestors on the continent, and of the northern Europeans generally; inthe legislation and customs that immediately succeeded Magna Carta; in the oathsthat have at different times been administered to jurors, &c., &c. This evidencecan be exhibited here but partially. To give it all would require too much spaceand labor.SECTION I.WEAKNESS OF THE REGAL AUTHORITY.Hughes, in his preface to his translation of Horne’s “Mirror of Justices,” (abook written in the time of Edward I., 1272 to 1307,) giving a concise view ofthe laws of England generally, says:> “Although in the Saxon’s time I find the usual words of the acts then to have> been edictum, (edict,) constitutio, (statute,) little mention being made of> the commons, yet I further find that, tum demum leges vim et vigorem> kabuerunt, cum fuerunt non modo institutæ sed firmatæ approbatione> communitatis.” (The laws had force and vigor only when they were not only> enacted, but confirmed by the approval of the community.)The Mirror of Justices itself also says, (ch. 1, sec. 3,) in speaking “Of thefirst Constitutions of the Ancient Kings:”> “Many ordinances were made by many kings, until the time of the king that now> is (Edward I.); the which ordinances were abused, or not used by many, nor> very current, because they were not put in writing, and certainly> published.”—Mirror of Justices, p. 6.Hallam says:> “The Franks, Lombards, and Saxons seem alike to have been jealous of judicial> authority; and averse to surrendering what concerned every man’s private> right, out of the hands of his neighbors and equals.”—1 Middle Ages, 271.The “judicial authority,” here spoken of, was the authority of the kings, (whoat that time united the office of both legislators and judges,) and not of aseparate department of government, called the judiciary, like what has existedin more modern times.[1]Hume says:> “The government of the Germans, and that of all the northern nations, who> established themselves on the ruins of Rome, was always extremely free; and> those fierce people, accustomed to independence and inured to arms, were more> guided by persuasion than authority, in the submission which they paid to> their princes. The military despotism, which had taken place in the Roman> empire, and which, previously to the irruption of those conquerors, had sunk> the genius of men, and destroyed every noble principle of science and virtue,> was unable to resist the vigorous efforts of a free people, and Europe, as> from a new epoch, rekindled her ancient spirit, and shook off the base> servitude to arbitrary will and authority under which she had so long labored.> The free constitutions then established, however impaired by the encroachments> of succeeding princes, still preserve an air of independence and legal> administration, which distinguished the European nations; and if that part of> the globe maintain sentiments of liberty, honor, “equity, and valor, superior> to the Test of mankind, it owes these advantages chiefly to the seeds> implanted by those generous barbarians.> > “The Saxons, who subdued Britain, as they enjoyed great liberty in their own> country, obstinately retained that invaluable possession in their new> settlement; and they imported into this island the same principles of> independence, which they had inherited from their ancestors. The chieftains,> (for such they were, more than kings or princes,) who commanded them in those> military expeditions, still possessed a very limited authority; and as the> Saxons exterminated, rather than subdued the ancient inhabitants, they were,> indeed, transplanted into a new territory, but preserved unaltered all their> civil and military institutions. The language was pure Saxon; even the names> of places, which often remain while the tongue entirely changes, were almost> all affixed by the conquerors; the manners and customs were wholly German; and> the same picture of a fierce and bold liberty, which is drawn by the masterly> pen of Tacitus, will suit those founders of the English government. The king,> so far from being invested with arbitrary power, was only considered as the> first among the citizens; his authority depended more on his personal> qualities than on his station; he was even so far on a level with the people,> that a stated price was fixed for his head, and a legal fine was levied upon> his murderer, which though proportionate to his station, and superior to that> paid for the life of a subject, was a sensible mark of his subordination to> the community—1 Hume, Appendix, 1.Stuart says:> “The Saxons brought along with them into Britain their own customs, language,> and civil institutions. Free in Germany, they renounced not their> independence, when they had conquered. Proud from victory, and with their> swords in their hands, would they surrender their liberties to a private man?> Would temporary leaders, limited in their powers, and unprovided in resources,> ever think to usurp an authority over warriors, who considered themselves as> their equals, were impatient of control, and attached with devoted zeal to> their privileges? Or, would they find leisure to form resolutions, or> opportunities to put them in practice, amidst the tumult and confusion of> those fierce and bloody wars, which their nations first waged with the> Britons, and then engaged in among themselves? Sufficiently flattered in> leading the armies of their countrymen, the ambition of commanders could as> little suggest such designs, as the liberty of the people could submit to> them. The conquerors of Britain retained their independence; and this island> saw itself again in that free state in which the Roman arms had discovered it.> > “The same firmness of character, and generosity of manners, which, in general,> distinguished the Germans, were possessed in an eminent degree by the Saxons;> and while we endeavor to unfold their political institutions, we must> perpetually turn our observation to that masterly picture in which the Roman> historian has described these nations. In the woods of Germany shall we find> the principles which directed the state of land, in the different kingdoms of> Europe; and there shall we find the foundation of those ranks of men, and of> those civil arrangements, which the barbarians everywhere established; and> which the English alone have had the good fortune, or the spirit, to> preserve.”—Stuart on the Constitution of England, p. 59–61.> “Kings they (the Germans) respected as the first magistrates of the state; but> the authority possessed by them was narrow and limited.”—Ditto, p. 134.> “Did he, (the king,) at any time, relax his activity and martial ardor, did he> employ his abilities to the prejudice of his nation, or fancy he was superior> to the laws; the same power which raised him to honor, humbled and degraded> him.

But had a sovereign declared war against a> neighboring state, without requiring their advice, or if he meant to revenge> by arms an insult offered to him by a subject, a haughty and independent> nobility refused their assistance. These they considered as the quarrels of> the king, and not of the nation; and in all such emergencies he could only be> assisted by his retainers and dependents.”—Ditto, p. 147–8.> “Nor must we imagine that the Saxon, any more than the German monarchs,> succeeded each other in a lineal descent.[2] or that they disposed of the> crown at their pleasure. In both countries, the free election of the people> filled the throne; and their choice was the only rule by which princes> reigned. The succession, accordingly, of their kings was often broken and> interrupted, and their depositions were frequent and groundless. The will of a> prince whom they had long respected, and the favor they naturally transferred> to his descendant, made them often advance him to the royal dignity; but the> crown of his ancestor he considered as the gift of the people, and neither> expected nor claimed it as a right.”—Ditto, p. 151–3.> In Germany “It was the business of the great to command in war, and in peace> they distributed justice. * * *> > “The princes in Germany were earls in England.

In these his officers formed no courts, and his writ was disregarded. *> * *> > “They had officers, as well as the king, who collected their revenues, and> added to their greatness; and the inhabitants of their lands they> distinguished by the name of subjects.> > “But to attend the general assembly of their nation was the chief prerogative> of the German and Saxon princes; and as they consulted the interest of their> country, and deliberated concerning matters of state, so in the king’s court,> of which also they were members, they assisted to pronounce judgment in the> complaints and appeals which were lodged in it.”—Ditto, p. 158 to 165.Henry says:> “Nothing can be more evident than this important truth; that our Anglo-Saxon> kings were not absolute monarchs; but that their powers and prerogatives were> limited by the laws and customs of the country. Our Saxon ancestors had been> governed by limited monarchs in their native seats on the continent; and there> is not the least appearance or probability that they relinquished their> liberties, and submitted to absolute government in their new settlements in> this island. It is not to be imagined that men, whose reigning passion was the> love of liberty, would willingly resign it; and their new sovereigns, who had> been their fellow-soldiers, had certainly no power to compel them to such a> resignation.”—3 Henry’s History of Great Britain, 358.Mackintosh says:> “The Saxon chiefs, who were called kings, originally acquired power by the> same natural causes which have gradually, and everywhere, raised a few men> above their fellows. They were, doubtless, more experienced, more skilful,> more brave, or more beautiful, than those who followed them. * * A king was> powerful in war by the lustre of his arms, and the obvious necessity of> obedience. His influence in peace fluctuated with his personal character. In> the progress of usage his power became more fixed and more limited. * * It> would be very unreasonable to suppose that the northern Germans who had> conquered England, had so far changed their characteristic habits from the age> of Tacitus, that the victors became slaves, and that their generals were> converted into tyrants.”—Mackintosh’s Hist. of England, Ch. 2. 45 Lardner’s> Cab. Cyc., 73–4.Rapin, in his discourse on the “Origin and Nature of the English Constitution,”says:> “There are but two things the Saxons did not think proper to trust their kings> with; for being of like passions with other men, they might very possibly> abuse them; namely, the power of changing the laws enacted by consent of king> and people; and the power of raising taxes at pleasure. From these two> articles sprung numberless branches concerning the liberty and property of the> subject, which the king cannot touch, without breaking the constitution, and> they are the distinguishing character of the English monarchy. The> prerogatives of the crown, and the rights and privileges of the people,> flowing from the two fore-mentioned articles, are the ground of all the laws> that from time to time have been made by unanimous consent of king and people.> The English government consists in the strict union of the king’s prerogatives> with the people’s liberties. * * But when kings arose, as some there were,> that aimed at absolute power, by changing the old, and making new laws, at> pleasure; by imposing illegal taxes on the people; this excellent government> being, in a manner, dissolved by these destructive measures, confusion and> civil wars ensued, which some very wrongfully ascribe to the fickle and> restless temper of the English.”—Rapin’s Preface to his History of England.Hallam says that among the Saxons, “the royal authority was weak.”—2 MiddleAges, 403.But although the king himself had so little authority, that it cannot besupposed for a moment that his laws were regarded as imperative by the people,it has nevertheless been claimed, in modern times, by some who seem determinedto find or make a precedent for the present legislative authority of parliament,that his laws were authoritative, when assented to by the Witena-gemote, orassembly of wise men—that is, the bishops and barons. But this assemblyevidently had no legislative power whatever. The king would occasionally invitethe bishops and barons to meet him for consultation on public affairs, simply asa council, and not as a legislative body. Such as saw fit to attend, did so. Ifthey were agreed upon what ought to be done, the king would pass a lawaccordingly, and the barons and bishops would then return and inform the peopleorally what laws had been passed, and use their influence with them to inducethem to conform to the law of the king, and the recommendation of the council.And the people no doubt were much more likely to accept a law of the king, if ithad been approved by this council, than if it had not. But it was still only alaw of the king, which they obeyed or disregarded according to their own notionsof expediency. The numbers who usually attended this council were too small toadmit of the supposition that they had any legislative authority whatever, toimpose laws upon the people against their will.Lingard says:> “It was necessary that the king should obtain the assent of these (the members> of the Witena-gemotes) to all legislative enactments; because, without their> acquiescence and support, it was impossible to carry them into execution. To> many charters (laws) we have the signatures of the Witan. They seldom exceed> thirty in number; they never amount to sixty.”—1 Lingard, 486.It is ridiculous to suppose that the assent of such an assembly gave anyauthority to the laws of the king, or had any influence in securing obedience tothem, otherwise than by way of persuasion. If this body had had any reallegislative authority, such as is accorded to legislative bodies of the presentday, they would have made themselves at once the most conspicuous portion of thegovernment, and would have left behind them abundant evidence of their power,instead of the evidence simply of their assent to a few laws passed by the king.More than this. If this body had had any real legislative authority, they wouldhave constituted an aristocracy, having, in conjunction with the king, absolutepower over the people. Assembling voluntarily, merely on the invitation of theking; deputed by nobody but themselves; representing nobody but themselves;responsible to nobody but themselves; their legislative authority, if they hadhad any, would of necessity have made the government the government of anaristocracy merely, and the people slaves, of course. And this would necessarilyhave been the picture that history would have given us of the Anglo-Saxongovernment, and of Anglo-Saxon liberty.The fact that the people had no representation in this assembly, and the furtherfact that, through their juries alone, they nevertheless maintained that noblefreedom, the very tradition of which (after the substance of the thing itselfhas ceased to exist) has constituted the greatest pride and glory of the nationto this day, prove that this assembly exercised no authority which juries of thepeople acknowledged, except at their own discretion.[4]There is not a more palpable truth, in the history of the Anglo-Saxongovernment, than that stated in the Introduction to Gilbert’s History of theCommon Pleas,[5] viz., “that the County and Hundred Courts,” (to which shouldhave been added the other courts in which juries sat, the courts-baron andcourt-leet,) “in those times were the real and only Parliaments of the kingdom.”And why were they the real and only parliaments of the kingdom? Solely because,as will be hereafter shown, the juries in those courts tried causes on theirintrinsic merits, according to their own ideas of justice, irrespective of thelaws agreed upon by kings, priests, and barons; and whatever principles theyuniformly, or perhaps generally, enforced, and none others, became practicallythe law of the land as matter of course.[6]Finally, on this point. Conclusive proof that the legislation of the king was oflittle or no authority, is found in the fact that the kings enacted so few laws.If their laws had been received as authoritative, in the manner that legislativeenactments are at this day, they would have been making laws continually. Yetthe codes of the most celebrated kings are very small, and were little more thancompilations of immemorial customs. The code of Alfred would not fill twelvepages of the statute book of Massachusetts, and was little or nothing else thana compilation of the laws of Moses, and the Saxon customs, evidently collectedfrom considerations of convenience, rather than enacted on the principle ofauthority. The code of Edward the Confessor would not fill twenty pages of thestatute book of Massachusetts, and, says Blackstone, “seems to have been no morethan a new edition, or fresh promulgation of Alfred’s code, or dome-book, withsuch additions and improvements as the experience of a century and a halfsuggested.”—1 Blackstone, 66.[7]The Code of William the Conqueror[8] would fill less than seven pages of thestatute book of Massachusetts; and most of the laws contained in it are takenfrom the laws of the preceding kings, and especially of Edward the Confessor(whose laws William swore to observe); but few of his own being added.The codes of the other Saxon and Norman kings were, as a general rule, lessvoluminous even than these that have been named; and probably did not exceedthem in originality.[9] The Norman princes, from William the Conqueror to John,I think without exception, bound themselves, and, in order to maintain theirthrones, were obliged to bind themselves, to observe the ancient laws andcustoms, in other words, the “lex terræ,” or “common law” of the kingdom. EvenMagna Carta contains hardly anything other than this same “common law,” withsome new securities for its observance.How is this abstinence from legislation, on the part of the ancient kings, to beaccounted for, except on the supposition that the people would accept, andjuries enforce, few or no new laws enacted by their kings? Plainly it can beaccounted for in no other way. In fact, all history informs us that ancientlythe attempts of the kings to introduce or establish new laws, met withdetermined resistance from the people, and generally resulted in failure.“Nolumus Leges Angliæ mutari,” (we will that the laws of England be notchanged,) was a determined principle with the Anglo-Saxons, from which theyseldom departed, up to the time of Magna Carta, and indeed until long after.[10]SECTION II.THE ANCIENT COMMON LAW JURIES WERE MERE COURTS OF CONSCIENCE.But it is in the administration of justice, or of law, that the freedom orsubjection of a people is tested. If this administration be in accordance withthe arbitrary will of the legislator—that is, if his will, as it appears in hisstatutes, be the highest rule of decision known to the judicial tribunals,—thegovernment is a despotism, and the people are slaves. If, on the other hand, therule of decision be those principles of natural equity and justice, whichconstitute, or at least are embodied in, the general conscience of mankind, thepeople are free in just so far as that conscience is enlightened.That the authority of the king was of little weight with the judicial tribunals,must necessarily be inferred from the face already stated, that his authorityover the people was but weak. If the authority of his laws had been paramount inthe judicial tribunals, it would have been paramount with the people, of course;because they would have had no alternative but submission. The fact, then, thathis laws were not authoritative with the people, is proof that they were notauthoritative with the tribunals—in other words, that they were not, as matterof course, enforced by the tribunals.But we have additional evidence that, up to the time of Magna Carta, the laws ofthe king were not binding upon the judicial tribunals; and if they were notbinding before that time, they certainly were not afterwards, as has alreadybeen shown from Magna Carta itself. It is manifest from all the accounts we haveof the courts in which juries sat, prior to Magna Carta, such as thecourt-baron, the hundred court, the court-leet, and the county court, that theywere mere courts of conscience, and that the juries were the judges, decidingcauses according to their own notions of equity, and not according to any lawsof the king, unless they thought them just.These courts, it must be considered, were very numerous, and held very frequentsessions. There were probably seven, eight, or nine hundred courts a month, inthe kingdom; the object being, as Blackstone says, “to bring justice home toevery man’s door.” (3 Blackstone, 30.) The number of the county courts, ofcourse, corresponded to the number of counties, (36.), The court-leet was thecriminal court for a district less than a county. The hundred court was thecourt for one of those districts anciently called a hundred, because, at thetime of their first organization for judicial purposes, they comprised (as issupposed) but a hundred families.[11] The court-baron was the court for a singlemanor, and there was a court for every manor in the kingdom. All these courtswere holden as often as once in three or five weeks; the county court once amonth. The king’s judges were present at none of these courts; the only officersin attendance being sheriffs, bailiffs, and stewards, merely ministerial, andnot judicial, officers; doubtless incompetent, and, if not incompetent,untrustworthy, for giving the juries any reliable information in matters of law,beyond what was already known to the jurors themselves. And yet these were thecourts, in which was done all the Judicial business, both civil and criminal, ofthe nation, except appeals, and some of the more important and difficultcases.[12] It is plain that the juries, in these courts, must, of necessity,have been the sole judges of all matters of law whatsoever; because there was noone present, but sheriffs, bailiffs, and stewards, to give them anyinstructions; and surely it will not be pretended that the jurors were bound totake their law from such sources as these.In the second place, it is manifest that the principles of law, by which thejuries determined causes, were, as a general rule, nothing else than their ownideas of natural equity, and not any laws of the king; because but few laws wereenacted, and many of those were not written, but only agreed upon incouncil.[13] Of those that were written, few copies only were made, (printingbeing then unknown,) and not enough to supply all, or any considerable number,of these numerous courts. Beside and beyond all this, few or none of the jurorscould have read the laws, if they had been written; because few or none of thecommon people could, at that time, read. Not only were the common people unableto read their own language, but, at the time of Magna Carta, the laws werewritten in Latin, a language that could be read by few persons except thepriests, who were also the lawyers of the nation. Mackintosh says, “the firstact of the House of Commons composed and recorded in the English tongue,” was in1415, two centuries after Magna Carta.[14] Up to this time, and for some seventyyears later, the laws were generally written either in Latin or French; bothlanguages incapable of being read by the common people, as well Normans asSaxons; and one of them, the Latin, not only incapable of being read by them,but of being even understood when it was heard by them.To suppose that the people were bound to obey, and juries to enforce, laws, manyof which were unwritten, none of which they could read, and the larger part ofwhich (those written in Latin) they could not translate, or understand when theyheard them read, is equivalent to supposing the nation sunk in the mostdegrading slavery, instead of enjoying a liberty of their own choosing.Their knowledge of the laws passed by the king was, of course, derived only fromoral information; and “the good laws,” as some of them were called, incontradistinction to others—those which the people at large esteemed to be goodlaws—were doubtless enforced by the juries, and the others, as a general thing,disregarded.[15]That such was the nature of judicial proceedings, and of the power of juries, upto the time of Magna Carta, is further shown by the following authorities.> “The sheriffs and bailiffs caused the free tenants of their bailiwics to meet> at their counties and hundreds; at which justice was so done, that every one> so judged his neighbor by such judgment as a man could not elsewhere receive> in the like cases, until such times as the customs of the realm were put in> writing, and certainly published.> > “And although a freeman commonly was not to serve (as a juror or judge)> without his assent, nevertheless it was assented unto that free tenants should> meet together in the counties and hundreds, and lords courts, if they were not> specially exempted to do such suits, and there judged their neighbors.”—Mirror> of Justices, p. 7, 8.Gilbert, in his treatise on the Constitution of England, says:> “In the county courts, if the debt was above forty shillings, there issued a> justicies (a commission) to the sheriff, to enable him to hold such a plea,> where the suitors (jurors) are judges of the law and fact.”—Gilbert’s Cases in> Law and Equity, &c., &c., 456.All the ancient writs, given in Glanville, for summoning jurors, indicate thatthe jurors judged of everything, on their consciences only. The writs are inthis form:> “Summon twelve free and legal men (or sometimes twelve knights) to be in> court, prepared upon their oaths to declare whether A or B have the greater> right to the land (or other thing) in question.” See Writs in Beames’> Glanville, p. 54 to 70, and 233–306 to 332.Crabbe, speaking of the time of Henry I., (1100 to 1135,) recognizes the factthat the jurors were the judges. He says:> “By one law, every one was to be tried by his peers, who were of the same> neighborhood as himself. * * By another law, the judges, for so the jury were> called, were to be chosen by the party impleaded, after the manner of the> Danish nem-bas; by which, probably, is to be understood that the defendant had> the liberty of taking exceptions to, or challenging the jury, as it was> afterwards called.”—Crabbe’s History of the English Law, p. 55.Reeve says:> “The great court for civil business was the county court; held once every four> weeks. Here the sheriff presided; but the suitors of the court, as they were> called, that is, the freemen or landholders of the county, were the judges;> and the sheriff was to execute the judgment. * * *> > “The hundred court was held before some bailiff; the leet before the lord of> the manor’s steward.[16] * *> > “Out of the county court was derived an inferior court of civil jurisdiction,> called the court-baron. This was held from three weeks to three weeks, and was> in every respect like the county court{that is, the jurors were judges in it;)> “only the lord to whom this franchise was granted, or his steward, presided> instead of the sheriff.”—1 Reeve’s History of the English Law, p. 7.Chief Baron Gilbert says:> “Besides the tenants of the king, which held per baroniam, (by the right of a> baron,) and did suit and service (served as judges) at his own court; and the> burghers and tenants in ancient demesne, that did suit and service (served as> jurors or judges) in their own court in person, and in the king’s by proxy,> there was also a set of freeholders, that did suit and service (served as> jurors) at the county court. These were such as anciently held of the lord of> the county, and by the escheats of earldoms had fallen to the king; or such as> were granted out by service to hold of the king, but with particular> reservation to do suit and service (serve as jurors) before the king’s> bailiff; because it was necessary the sheriff, or bailiff of the king, should> have suitors (jurors) at the county court, that the business might be> despatched. These suitors are the pares (peers) of the county court, and> indeed the judges of it; as the pares (peers) were the judges in every> court-baron; and therefore the king’s bailiff having a court before him, there> must be pares or judges, for the sheriff himself is not a judge; and though> the style of the court is Curia prima Comitatus E.

C. knight,> sheriff of the aforesaid county, held at B., &c.); by which it appears that> the court was the sheriff’s; yet, by the old feudal constitutions, the lord> was not judge, but the pares {peers) only; so that, even in a justicies, which> was a commission to the sheriff to hold plea of more than was allowed by the> natural jurisdiction of a county court, the pares (peers, jurors) only were> judges, and not the sheriff; because it was to hold plea in the same manner as> they used to do in that (the lord’s) court.”—Gilbert on the Court of> Exchequer, ch. 5, p. 61–2.> “It is a distinguishing feature of the feudal system, to make civil> jurisdiction necessarily, and criminal jurisdiction ordinarily, coextensive> with tenure; and accordingly there is inseparably incident to every manor a> court-baron (curia baronum), being a court in which the freeholders of the> manor are the sole judges, but in which the lord, by himself, or more commonly> by his steward, presides.”—Political Dictionary, word Manor.The same work, speaking of the county court, says: “The judges were thefreeholders who did suit to the court.” See word Courts.> “In the case of freeholders attending as suitors, the county court or> court-baron, (as in the case of the ancient tenants per baroniam attending> Parliament,) the suitors are the judges of the court, both for law and for> fact, and the sheriff or the under sheriff in the county court, and the lord> or his steward in the court-baron, are only presiding officers, with no> judicial authority.”—Political Dictionary, word Suit.> “Court, (curtis, curia aula); the space enclosed by the walls of a feudal> residence, in which the followers of a lord used to assemble in the middle> ages, to administer justice, and decide respecting affairs of common interest,> &c.

And the same order as well> in civil matters and pecuniary, as in matters criminal.”—Smith’s Commonwealth> of England, ch. 9, p. 53, Edition of 1621.> Court-Leet. “That the leet is the most ancient court in the land for criminal> matters, (the court-baron being of no less antiquity in civil,) has been> pronounced by the highest legal authority. * * Lord Mansfield states that this> court was coeval with the establishment of the Saxons here, and its activity> marked very visibly both among the Saxons and Danes. * * The leet is a court> of record for the cognizance of criminal matters, or pleas of the crown; and> necessarily belongs to the king; though a subject, usually the lord of the> manor, may be, and is, entitled to the profits, consisting of the essoign> pence, fines, and amerciaments.> > “It is held before the steward, or was, in ancient times, before the bailiff,> of the lord.”—Tomlin’s Law Dict., word Court-Leet.Of course the jury were the judges in this court, where only a “steward” or“bailiff” of a manor presided.> “No cause of consequence was determined without the king’s writ; for even in> the county courts, of the debts, which were above forty shillings, there> issued a Justicies (commission) to the sheriff, to enable him to hold such> plea, where the suitors are judges of the law and fact.”—Gilbert’s History of> the Common Pleas, Introduction, p. 19.> “This position” (that “the matter of law was decided by the King’s Justices,> but the matter of fact by the pares”) “is wholly incompatible with the common> law, for the Jurata (Jury) were the sole judges both of the law and the> fact.”—Gilbert’s History of the Common Pleas, p. 70, note.> “We come now to the challenge; and of old the suitors in court, who were> judges, could not be challenged; nor by the feudal law could the pares be even> challenged, Pares qui ordinariam jurisdictionem habent recusari non possunt;> (the peers who have ordinary jurisdiction cannot be rejected;) “but those> suitors who are judges of the court, could not be challenged; and the reason> is, that there are several qualifications required by the writ, viz., that> they be liberos et legales homines de vincineto (free and legal men of the> neighborhood) of the place laid in the declaration,” &c., &c.—Ditto, p. 93.> “Ad questionem juris non respondent Juratores.” (To the question of law the> jurors do not answer.) “The Annotist says, that this is indeed a maxim in the> Civil-Law Jurisprudence, but it does not bind an English jury, for by the> common law of the land the jury are judges as well of the matter of law, as of> the fact, with this difference only, that the (a Saxon word) or judge on the> bench is to give them no assistance in determining the matter of fact, but if> they have any doubt among themselves relating to matter of law, they may then> request him to explain it to them, which when he hath done, and they are thus> become well informed, they, and they only, become competent judges of the> matter of law.

They were consequently judges in civil> causes, determined before the manorial tribunal—2 Middle Ages, 481.Stephens adopts as correct the following quotations from Blackstone:> “The Court-Baron is a court incident to every manor in the kingdom, to be> holden by the steward within the said manor.” * * It “is a court of common> law, and it is the court before the freeholders who owe suit and service to> the manor,” (are bound to serve as jurors in the courts of the manor,) “the> steward being rather the registrar than the judge. * * The freeholders’ court> was composed of the lord’s tenants, who were the pares (equals) of each other,> and were bound by their feudal tenure to assist their lord in the dispensation> of domestic justice.

But . . compurgators were merelywitnesses; jurymen were, in reality, judges. The former were called to confirmthe oath of the party by swearing, according to their belief, that he had toldthe truth, (in his oath of purgation;) the latter were appointed to try, bywitnesses, and by all other means of proof, whether he was innocent or guilty. .. Juries were accustomed to ascertain the truth of facts, by the defendant’soath of purgation, together with that of his compurgators. . . Both of them(jurymen and compurgators) were obliged to swear that they would fell the truth.. . According to the simple idea of our forefathers, guilt or innocence wasregarded as a mere matter of fact; and it was thought that no man, who knew thereal circumstances of a case, could be at a loss to determine whether theculprit ought to be condemned or acquitted.”—1 Millar’s Hist. View of Eng. Gov.,ch. 12, p. 332–4.Also, “The same form of procedure, which took place in the administration ofjustice among the vassals of a barony, was gradually extended to the courts heldin the trading towns.”—Same, p. 335.Also, “The same regulations, concerning the distribution of justice by theintervention of juries, . . were introduced into the baron courts of the king,as into those of the nobility, or such of his subjects as retained theirallodial property.”—Same, p. 337.Also, “This tribunal” (the aula regis, or king’s court, afterwards divided intothe courts of King’s Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer) “was properly theordinary baron-court of the king; and, being in the same circumstances with thebaron courts of the nobility, it was under the same necessity of trying causesby the intervention of a jury.”—Same, vol. 2, p. 292.Speaking of the times of Edward the First, (1272 to 1307,) Millar says:> “What is called the petty jury was therefore introduced into these tribunals,> (the King’s Bench, the Common Pleas, and the Exchequer,) as well as into their> auxiliary courts employed to distribute justice in the circuits; and was thus> rendered essentially necessary in determining causes of every sort, whether> civil, criminal, or fiscal.”—Same, vol. 2, p. 293–4.Also, “That this form of trial (by jury) obtained universally in all the feudalgovernments, as well as in that of England, there can be no reason to doubt. InFrance, in Germany, and in other European countries, where we have any accountsof the constitution and procedure of the feudal courts, it appears that lawsuitsof every sort concerning the freemen or vassals of a barony, were determined bythe pares curiæ (peers of the court;) and that the judge took little more uponhim than to regulate the method of proceeding, or to declare the verdict of thejury.”—Same, vol. 1, ch. 12, p. 329.Also, “Among the Gothic nations of modern Europe, the custom of decidinglawsuits by a jury seems to have prevailed universally; first in the allodialcourts of the county, or of the hundred, and afterwards in the baron-courts ofevery feudal superior.”—Same, vol. 2, p. 296.Palgrave says that in Germany “The Graff (gerefa, sheriff) placed himself in theseat of judgment, and gave the charge to the assembled free Echevins, warningthem to pronounce judgment according to right and justice.”—2 Palgrave, 147.Also, that, in Germany, “The Echevins were composed of the villanage, somewhatobscured in their functions by the learning of the grave civilian who wasassociated to them, and somewhat limited by the encroachments of modernfeudality; but they were still substantially the judges of the court.”—Same,148.Palgrave also says, “Scotland, in like manner, had the laws of Burlaw, orBirlaw, which were made and determined by the neighbors, elected by commonconsent, in the Burlaw or Birlaw courts, wherein knowledge was taken ofcomplaints between neighbor and neighbor, which men, so chosen, were judges andarbitrators, and called Birlaw men.”—1 Palgram’s Rise, &c., p. 80.But, in order to understand the common law trial by jury, as it existed prior toMagna Carta, and as it was guaranteed by that instrument, it is perhapsindispensable to understand more fully the nature of the courts ill which juriessat, and the extent of the powers exercised by juries in those courts. Itherefore give in a note extended extracts, on these points, from Stuart on theConstitution of England, and from Blackstone’s Commentaries.[20]That all these courts were mere courts of conscience, in which the juries weresole judges, (administering justice according to their own ideas of it, is notonly shown by the extracts already given, but is explicitly acknowledged in thefollowing one, in which the modern “courts of conscience” are compared with theancient hundred and county courts, and the preference given to the latter, onthe ground that the duties of the jurors in the one case, and of thecommissioners in the other, are the same, and that the consciences of a jury area safer and purer tribunal than the consciences of individuals speciallyappointed, and holding permanent offices.> “But there is one species of courts constituted by act of Parliament, in the> city of London, and other trading and populous districts, which, in their> proceedings, so vary from the course of the common law, that they deserve a> more particular consideration. I mean the court of requests, or courts of> conscience, for the recovery of small debts. The first of these was> established in London so early as the reign of Henry VIII., by an act of their> common council; which, however, was certainly insufficient for that purpose,> and illegal, till confirmed by statute 3 Jac. I., ch. 15, which has since been> explained and amended by statute 14 Geo. II., ch. 10. The constitution is> this: two aldermen and four commoners sit twice a week to hear all causes of> debt not exceeding the value of forty shillings; which they examine in a> summary way, by the oath of the parties or other witnesses, and make such,> order therein as is consonant to equity and good conscience. * * * Divers> trading towns and other districts have obtained acts of Parliament, for> establishing in them courts of conscience upon nearly the same plan as that in> the city of London.> > “The anxious desire that has been shown to obtain these several acts, proves> clearly that the nation, in general, is truly sensible of the great> inconvenience arising from the disuse of the ancient county and hundred> courts, wherein causes of this small value were always formerly decided with> very little trouble and expense to the parties. But it is to be feared that> the general remedy, which of late hath been principally applied to this> inconvenience, (the erecting these new jurisdictions,) may itself be attended> in time with very ill consequences; as the method of proceeding therein is> entirely in derogation of the common law; and their large discretionary powers> create a petty tyranny in a set of standing commissioners; and as the disuse> of the trial by jury may tend to estrange the minds of the people from that> valuable prerogative of Englishmen, which has already been more than> sufficiently excluded in many instances. How much rather is it to be wished> that the proceedings in the county and hundred courts could be again revived,> without burdening the freeholders with too frequent and tedious attendances;> and at the same time removing the delays that have insensibly crept into their> proceedings, and the power that either party has of transferring at pleasure> their suits to the courts at Westminster! And we may, with satisfaction,> observe, that this experiment has been actually tried, and has succeeded in> the populous county of Middlesex, which might serve as an example for others.> For by statute 23 Geo. II., ch. 33, it is enacted:> > 1. That a special county court shall be held at least once in a month, in> every hundred of the county of Middlesex, by the county clerk.> > 2. That twelve freeholders of that hundred, qualified to serve on juries, and> struck by the sheriff, shall be summoned to appear at such court by rotation;> so as none shall be summoned oftener than once a year.> > 3. That in all causes not exceeding the value of forty shillings, the county> clerk and twelve suitors (jurors) shall proceed in a summary way, examining> the parties and witnesses on oath, without the formal process anciently used;> and shall make such order therein as they shall judge agreeable to> conscience.”—3 Blackstone, 81–83.What are these but courts of conscience? And yet Blackstone tells us they are arevival of the ancient hundred and county courts. And what does this fact prove,but that the ancient common law courts, in which juries sat, were mere courts ofconscience?It is perfectly evident that in all these courts the jurors were the judges, anddetermined all questions of law for themselves; because the only alternative tothat supposition is, that the jurors took their law from sheriffs, bailiffs, andstewards, of which there is not the least evidence in history, nor the leastprobability in reason. It is evident, also, that they judged independently ofthe laws of the king, for the reasons before given, viz., that the authority ofthe king was held in very little esteem; and, secondly, that the laws of theking (not being printed, and the people being unable to read them if they hadbeen printed) must have been in a great measure unknown to them, and could havebeen received by them only on the authority of the sheriff, bailiff, or steward.If laws were to be received by them on the authority of these officers, thelatter would have imposed such laws upon the people as they pleased.These courts, that have now been described, were continued in full power longafter Magna Carta, no alteration being made in them by that instrument, nor inthe mode of administering justice in them.There is no evidence whatever, so far as I am aware, that the juries had anyless power in the courts held by the king’s justices, than in those held bysheriffs, bailiffs, and stewards; and there is no probability whatever that theyhad. All the difference between the former courts and the latter undoubtedlywas, that, in the former, the juries had the benefit of the advice andassistance of the justices, which would, of course, be considered valuable indifficult cases, on account of the justices being regarded as more learned, notonly in the laws of the king, but also in the common law, or “law of the land.”The conclusion, therefore, I think, inevitably must be, that neither the laws ofthe king, nor the instructions of his justices, had any authority over jurorsbeyond what the latter saw fit to accord to them. And this view is confirmed bythis remark of Hallam, the truth of which all will acknowledge:> “The rules of legal decision, among a rude people, are always very simple; not> serving much to guide, far less to control the feelings of natural equity.”—2> Middle Ages, ch. 8, part 2, p. 465.It is evident that it was in this way, by the free and concurrent judgments ofjuries, approving and enforcing certain laws and rules of conduct, correspondingto their notions of right and justice, that the laws and customs, which, for themost part, made up the common law, and were called, at that day, “the good laws,and good customs,” and “the law of the land,” were established. How otherwisecould they ever have become established, as Blackstone says they were, “by longand immemorial usage, and by their universal reception throughout thekingdom,”[21] when, as the Mirror says, “justice was so done, that every one sojudged his neighbor, by such judgment as a man could not elsewhere receive inthe like cases, until such times as the customs of the realm were put in writingand certainly published?”The fact that, in that dark age, so many of the principles of natural equity, asthose then embraced in the Common Law, should have been so uniformly recognizedand enforced by juries, as to have become established by general consent as “thelaw of the land;” and the further fact that this “law of the land” was held sosacred that even the king could not lawfully infringe or alter it, but wasrequired to swear to maintain it, are beautiful and impressive illustrations ofthe truth that men’s minds, even in the comparative infancy of other knowledge,have clear and coincident ideas of the elementary principles, and the paramountobligation, of justice. The same facts also prove that the common mind, and thegeneral, or, perhaps, rather, the universal conscience, as developed in theuntrammelled judgments of juries, may be safely relied upon for the preservationof individual rights in civil society; and that there is no necessity or excusefor that deluge of arbitrary legislation, with which the present age isoverwhelmed, under the pretext that unless laws be made, the law will not beknown; a pretext, by the way, almost universally used for overturning, insteadof establishing, the principles of justice.SECTION III.THE OATHS OF JURORS.The oaths that have been administered to jurors, in England, and which are theirlegal guide to their duty, all (so far as I have ascertained them) corroboratethe idea that the jurors are to try all cases on their intrinsic merits,independently of any laws that they deem unjust or oppressive. It is probablethat an oath was never administered to a jury in England, either in a civil orcriminal case, to try it according to law.The earliest oath that I have found prescribed by law to be administered tojurors is in the laws of Ethelred, (about the year 1015,) which require that thejurors “shall swear, with their hands upon a holy thing, that they will condemnno man that is innocent. nor acquit any that is guilty.”—4 Blackstone, 302. 2Turner’s History of the Anglo-Saxons, 155. Wilkins’ Laws of the Anglo-Saxons,117. Spelman’s Glossary, word Jurata.Blackstone assumes that this was the oath of the grand jury (4 Blackstone, 302);but there was but one jury at the time this oath was ordained. The institutionof two juries, grand and petit, took place after the Norman Conquest.Hume, speaking of the administration of justice in the time of Alfred, saysthat, in every hundred,> “Twelve freeholders were chosen, who, having sworn, together with the> hundreder, or presiding magistrate of that division, to administer impartial> justice, proceeded to the examination of that cause which was submitted to> their jurisdiction.”—Hume, ch. 2.> By a law of Henry II., in 1164, it was directed that the sheriff “faciet> jurare duodecim legates homines de vicineto seu de villa, quod hide veritatem> secundum conscientiam suam manifestabunt,” (shall make twelve legal men from> the neighborhood to swear that they will make known the truth according to> their conscience.)—Crabbe’s History of the English Law, 119. 1 Reeves, 87.> Wilkins, 321–323.Glanville, who wrote within the half century previous to Magna Carta, says:> “Each of the knights summoned for this purpose (as jurors) ought to swear that> he will neither utter that which is false, nor knowingly conceal the> truth.”—Beames’ Glanville, 65.Reeve calls the trial by jury “the trial by twelve men sworn to speak thetruth”—1 Reeve’s History of the English Law, 87.Henry says that the jurors “took a solemn oath, that they would faithfullydischarge the duties of their office, and not suffer an innocent man to becondemned, nor any guilty person to be acquitted.”—3 Henry’s Hist. of GreatBritain, 346.The Mirror of Justices, (written within a century after Magna Carta,) in thechapter on the abuses of the Common Law, says:> “It is abuse to use the words, to their knowledge, in their oaths, to make the> jurors speak upon thoughts, since the chief words of their oaths be that they> speak the truth.”—p. 249.Smith, writing an the time of Elizabeth, says that, in civil suits, the jury “besworn to declare the truth of that issue according to the evidence, and theirconscience.”—Smith’s Commonwealth of England. edition of 1621, p. 73.In criminal trials, he says:> “The clerk giveth the juror an oath to go uprightly betwixt the prince and the> prisoner.”—Ditto, p. 90.[22]Hale says:> “Then twelve, and no less, of such as are indifferent and are returned upon> the principal panel, or the tales, are sworn to try the same according to the> evidence.”—2 Hale’s History of the Common Law, 141.It appears from Blackstone that, even at this day, neither in civil nor criminalcases, are jurors in England sworn to try causes according to law. He says thatin civil suits the jury are> “Sworn well and truly to try the issue between the parties, and a true verdict> to give according to the evidence.”—3 Blackstone, 365.“The issue” to be tried is whether A owes B anything; and if so, how much? orwhether A has in his possession anything that belongs to B; or whether A haswronged B, and ought to make compensation; and if so, how much?No statute passed by a legislature, simply as a legislature, can alter either ofthese “issues” in hardly any conceivable case, perhaps in none. No unjust lawcould ever alter them in any. They are all mere questions of natural justice,which legislatures have no power to alter, and with which they have no right tointerfere, further than to provide for having them settled by the most competentand impartial tribunal that it is practicable to have, and then for having alljust decisions enforced. And any tribunal, whether judge or jury, that attemptsto try these issues, has no more moral right to be swerved from the line ofjustice, by the will of a legislature, than by the will of any other body of menwhatever. And this oath does not require or permit a jury to be so swerved.In criminal cases, Blackstone says the oath of the jury in England is:> “Well and truly to try, and true deliverance make, between our sovereign lord,> the king, and the prisoner whom they have in charge, and a true verdict to> give according to the evidence.”—4 Blackstone, 355.“The issue” to be tried, in a criminal case, is “guilty,” or “not guilty.” Thelaws passed by a legislature can rarely, if ever, have anything to do with thisissue. “Guilt” is an intrinsic quality of actions, and can neither be created,destroyed, nor changed by legislation. And no tribunal that attempts to try thisissue can have any moral right to declare a man guilty, for an act that isintrinsically innocent. at the bidding of a legislature, any more than at thebidding of anybody else. And this oath does not require or permit a jury to doso.The words, “according to the evidence,” have doubtless been introduced into theabove oaths in modern times. They are unquestionably in violation of the CommonLaw, and of Magna Carta, if by them be meant such evidence only as thegovernment sees fit to allow to go to the jury. If the government can dictatethe evidence, and require the jury to decide according to that evidence, itnecessarily dictates the conclusion to which they must arrive. In that case thetrial is really a trial by the government, and not by the jury. The jury cannottry an issue, unless they determine what evidence shall be admitted. The ancientoaths, it will be observed, say nothing about “according to the evidence.” Theyobviously take it for granted that the jury try the whole case; and of coursethat they decide what evidence shall be admitted. It would be intrinsically animmoral and criminal act for a jury to declare a man guilty, or to declare thatone man owed money to another, unless all the evidence were admitted, which theythought ought to be admitted, for ascertaining the truth.[23]Grand Jury.—If jurors are bound to enforce all laws passed by the legislature,it is a very remarkable fact that the oath of grand juries does not require themto be governed by the laws in finding indictments. There have been various formsof oath administered to grand jurors; but by none of them that I recollect everto have seen, except those of the States of Connecticut and Vermont, are theysworn to present men according to law. The English form, as given in the essayon Grand Juries, written near two hundred years ago, and supposed to have beenwritten by Lord Somers, is as follows:> “You shall diligently inquire, and true presentment make, of all such> articles, matters, and things, as shall be given you in charge, and of all> other matters and things as shall come to your knowledge touching this present> service. The king’s council, your fellows, and your own, you shall keep> secret. You shall present no person for hatred or malice; neither shall you> leave any one unpresented for favor, or affection, for love or gain, or any> hopes thereof; but in ail things you shall present the truth, the whole truth,> and nothing but the truth, to the best of your knowledge. So help you God.”This form of oath is doubtless quite ancient, for the essay says “our ancestorsappointed” it.—See Essay, p. 33–34.On the obligations of this oath, the essay says:> “If it be asked how, or in what manner, the (grand) juries shall inquire, the> answer is ready, according to the best of their understandings. They only, not> the judges, are sworn to search diligently to find out all treasons, &c.,> within their charge, and they must and ought to use their own discretion in> the way and manner of their inquiry. No directions can legally be imposed upon> them by any court or judges; an honest jury will thankfully accept good advice> from judges, as their assistants; but they are bound by their oaths to present> the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to the best of their> own, not the judge’s, knowledge. Neither can they, without breach of that> oath, resign their consciences, or blindly submit to the dictates of others;> and therefore ought to receive or reject such advices, as they judge them good> or bad. * * Nothing can be more plain and express than the words of the oath> are to this purpose. The jurors need not search the law books, nor tumble over> heaps of old records, for the explanation of them. Our greatest lawyers may> from hence learn more certainly our ancient law in this case, than from all> the books in their studies. The language wherein the oath is penned is known> and understood by every man, and the words in it have the same signification> as they have wheresoever else they are used. The judges, without assuming to> themselves a legislative power, cannot put a new sense upon them, other than> according to their genuine, common meaning. They cannot magisterially impose> their opinions upon the jury, and make them forsake the direct words of their> oath, to pursue their glosses. The grand inquest are bound to observe alike> strictly every part of their oath, and to use all just and proper ways which> may enable them to perform it; otherwise it were to say, that after men had> sworn to inquire diligently after the truth, according to the best of their> knowledge, they were bound to forsake all the natural and proper means which> their understandings suggest for the discovery of it, if it be commanded by> the judges.”—Lord Somers’ Essay on Grand Juries, p. 38.What is here said so plainly and forcibly of the oath and obligations of grandjuries, is equally applicable to the oath and obligations of petit juries. Inboth cases the simple oaths of the jurors, and not the instructions of thejudges, nor the statutes of kings nor legislatures, are their legal guides totheir duties.[24]SECTION IV.THE RIGHT OF JURIES TO FIX THE SENTENCE.The nature of the common law courts existing prior to Magna Carta, such as thecounty courts, the hundred courts, the court-leet, and the court-baron, allprove, what has already been proved from Magna Carta, that, in jury trials, thejuries fixed the sentence; because, in those courts, there was no one but thejury who could fix it, unless it were the sheriff, bailiff, or steward; and noone will pretend that it was fixed by them. The juries unquestionably gave the“judgment” in both civil and criminal cases.That the juries were to fix the sentence under Magna Carta, is also shown bystatutes subsequent to Magna Carta.A statute passed fifty-one years after Magna Carta, says that a baker, fordefault in the weight of his bread, “debeat amerciari vel subire judiciumpilloræ,”—that is, “ought to be amerced, or suffer the sentence of the pillory.”And that a brewer, for “selling ale, contrary to the assize,” “debeat amerciari,vel pati judicium tumbrelli;” that is, “ought to be amerced, or suffer judgmentof the tumbrel.”—51 Henry III., st. 6. (1266.)If the king (the legislative power) had had authority to fix the punishments ofthese offences imperatively, he would naturally have said these offenders shallbe amerced, and shall suffer judgment of the pillory and tumbrel, instead ofthus simply expressing the opinion that they ought to be punished in thatmanner.The statute of Westminster, passed sixty years after Magna Carta, provides that,> “No city, borough, nor town, nor any man, be amerced, without reasonable> cause, and according to the quantity of the trespass; that is to say, every> freeman saving his freehold, a merchant, saving his merchandise, a villein his> waynage, and that by his or their peers.”—3 Edward I., ch. 6. (1275.)The same statute (ch. 18) provides further, that,> “Forasmuch as the common fine and amercement of the whole county in Eyre of> the justices for false judgments, or for other trespass, is unjustly assessed> by sheriffs and baretors in the shires, so that the sum is many times> increased, and the parcels otherwise assessed than they ought to be, to the> damage of the people, which be many times paid to the sheriffs and baretors,> which do not acquit the payers; it is provided, and the king wills, that from> henceforth such sums shall be assessed before the justices in Eyre, afore> their departure, by the oath of knights and other honest men, upon all such as> ought to pay; and the justices shall cause the parcels to be put into their> estreats, which shall be delivered up unto the exchequer, and not the whole> sum.”—St. 3 Edward ch. 18, (1275.)[25]The following statute, passed in 1341, one hundred and twenty-five years afterMagna Carta, providing for the trial of peers of the realm, and the king’sministers, contains a recognition of the principle of Magna Carta, that the juryare to fix the sentence.> “Whereas before this time the peers of the land have been arrested and> imprisoned, and their temporalities, lands, and tenements, goods and cattels,> asseized in the king’s hands, and some put to death without judgment of their> peers: It is accorded and assented, that no peer of the land, officer, nor> other, because of his office, nor of things touching his office, nor by other> cause, shall be brought in judgment to lose his temporalities, lands,> tenements, goods and cattels, nor to be arrested, nor imprisoned, outlawed,> exiled, nor forejudged, nor put to answer, nor be judged, but by award> (sentence) of the said peers in Parliament.”—15 Edward III., st. 1, sec. 2.Section 4, of the same statute provides,> “That in every Parliament, at the third day of every Parliament, the king> shall take in his hands the offices of all the ministers aforesaid,” (that is,> “the chancellor, treasurer, barons, and chancellor of the exchequer, the> justices of the one bench and of the other, justices assigned in the country,> steward and chamberlain of the king’s house, keeper of the privy seal,> treasurer of the wardrobe, controllers, and they that be chief deputed to> abide nigh the king’s son, Duke of Cornwall,”) “and so they shall abide four> or five days; except the offices of justices of the one place or the other,> justices assigned, barons of exchequer; so always that they and all other> ministers be put to answer to every complaint; and if default be found in any> of the said ministers, by complaint or other manner, and of that attainted in> Parliament, he shall be punished by judgment of the peers, and put out of his> office, and another convenient put in his place. And upon the same our said> sovereign lord the king shall do (cause) to be pronounced and made execution> without delay, according to the judgment (sentence) of the said peers in the> Parliament.”Here is an admission that the peers were to fix the sentence, or judgment, andthe king promises to make execution “according to” that sentence.And this appears to be the law, under which peers of the realm and the greatofficers of the crown were tried and sentenced, for four hundred years after itspassage, and, for aught I know, until this day.The first case given in Hargrave’s collection of English State Trials, is thatof Alexander Nevil, Archbishop of York, Robert Vere, Duke of Ireland, Michael dela Pole, Earl of Suffolk, and Robert Tresilian, Lord Chief Justice of England,with several others, convicted of treason, before “the Lords of Parliament,” in1388. The sentences in these cases were adjudged by the “Lords of Parliament,”in the following terms, as they are reported.“Wherefore the said Lords of Parliament, there present, as judges in Parliament,in this case, by assent of the king, pronounced their sentence, and did adjudgethe said archbishop, duke, and earl, with Robert Tresilian, so appealed, asaforesaid, to be guilty, and convicted of treason, and to be drawn and hanged,as traitors and enemies to the king and kingdom; and that their heirs should bedisinherited forever, and their lands and tenements, goods and chattels,forfeited to the king, and that the temporalities of the Archbishop of Yorkshould be taken into the king’s hands.”Also, in the same case, Sir John Holt, Sir William Burgh, Sir John Cary, SirRoger Fulthorpe, and John Locton, “were by the lords temporal, by the assent ofthe king, adjudged to be drawn and hanged, as traitors, their heirsdisinherited, and their lands and tenements, goods and chattels, to be forfeitedto the king.”Also, in the same case, John Blake, “of council for the king,” and Thomas Uske,under sheriff of Middlesex, having been convicted of treason,“The lords awarded, by assent of the king, that they should both be hanged anddrawn as traitors, as open enemies to the king and kingdom, and their heirsdisinherited forever, and their lands and tenements, goods and chattels,forfeited to the king.”Also, “Simon Burleigh, the king’s chamberlain,” being convicted of treason, “byjoint consent of the king and the lords, sentence was pronounced against thesaid Simon Burleigh, that he should be drawn from the town to Tyburn, and therebe hanged till he be dead, and then have his head struck from his body.”Also, “John Beauchamp, steward of the household to the king, James Beroverse,and John Salisbury, knights, gentlemen of the privy chamber, were in like mannercondemned.”—1 Hargrave’s State Trials, first case.Here the sentences were all fixed by the peers, with the assent of the king. Butthat the king should be consulted, and his assent obtained to the sentencepronounced by the peers, does not imply any deficiency of power on their part tofix the sentence independently of the king. There are obvious reasons why theymight choose to consult the king, and obtain his approbation of the sentencethey were about to impose, without supposing any legal necessity for their sodoing.So far as we can gather from the reports of state trials, peers of the realmwere usually sentenced by those who tried them, with the assent of the king. Butin some instances no mention is made of the assent of the king, as in the caseof “Lionel, Earl of Middlesex, Lord High Treasurer of England,” in 1624, (fourhundred years after Magna Carta,) where the sentence was as follows:> “This High Court of Parliament doth adjudge, that Lionel, Earl of Middlesex,> now Lord Treasurer of England, shall lose all his offices which he holds in> this kingdom, and shall, hereafter, be made incapable of any office, place, or> employment in the state and commonwealth. That he shall be imprisoned in the> tower of London, during the king’s pleasure. That he shall pay unto our> sovereign lord the king a fine of 50,000 pounds. That he shall never sit in> Parliament any more, and that he shall never come within the verge of the> court.”—2 Howell’s State Trials, 1250.Here was a peer of the realm, and a minister of the king, of the highest grade;and if it were ever necessary to obtain the assent of the king to sentencespronounced by the peers, it would unquestionably have been obtained in thisinstance, and his assent would have appeared in the sentence.Lord Bacon was sentenced by the House of Lords, (1620,) no mention being made ofthe assent of the king. The sentence is in these words:> “And, therefore, this High Court doth adjudge, That the Lord Viscount St.> Albans, Lord Chancellor of England, shall undergo fine and ransom of 40,000> pounds. That he shall be imprisoned in the tower during the king’s pleasure.> That he shall forever be incapable of any office, place, or employment in the> state or commonwealth. That he shall never sit in Parliament, nor come within> the verge of the court.”And when it was demanded of him, before sentence, whether it were his hand thatwas subscribed to his confession, and whether he would stand to it; he made thefollowing answer, which implies that the lords were the ones to determine hissentence.> “My lords, it is my act, my hand, my heart. I beseech your lordships to be> merciful to a broken reed.”—1 Hargrave’s State Trials, 386–7.The sentence against Charles the First, (1648,) after reciting the grounds ofhis condemnation, concludes in this form:> “For all which treasons and crimes, this court doth adjudge, that he, the said> Charles Stuart, as a tyrant, traitor, murderer, and public enemy to the good> people of this nation, shall be put to death by the severing his head from his> body.”The report then adds:> “This sentence being read, the president (of the court) spake as followeth:> ‘This sentence now read and published, is the act, sentence, judgment and> resolution of the whole court.’”—1 Hargrave’s State Trials, 1037.Unless it had been the received “law of the land” that those who tried a manshould fix his sentence, it would have required an act of Parliament to fix thesentence of Charles, and his sentence would have been declared to be “thesentence of the law,” instead of “the act, sentence, judgment, and resolution ofthe court.”But the report of the proceedings in “the trial of Thomas, Earl of Macclesfield,Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, before the House of Lords, for highcrimes and misdemeanors in the execution of his office,” in 1725, is so full onthis point, and shows so clearly that it rested wholly with the lords to fix thesentence, and that the assent of the king was wholly unnecessary, that I givethe report somewhat at length.After being found guilty, the earl addressed the lords, for a mitigation ofsentence, as follows:> “‘I am now to expect your lordships’ judgment; and I hope that you will be> pleased to consider that I have suffered no small matter already in the trial,> in the expense I have been at, the fatigue, and what I have suffered> otherways. * * I have paid back 10,800 pounds of the money already; I have> lost my office; I have undergone the censure of both houses of Parliament,> which is in itself a severe punishment,’” &c., &c.On being interrupted, he proceeded:> “‘My lords, I submit whether this be not proper in mitigation of your> lordships’ sentence; but whether it be or not, I leave myself to your> lordships’ justice and mercy; I am sure neither of them will be wanting, and I> entirely submit.’ * *> > “Then the said earl, as also the managers, were directed to withdraw; and the> House (of Lords) ordered Thomas, Earl of Macclesfield, to be committed to the> custody of the gentleman usher of the black rod; and then proceeded to the> consideration of what judgment,” (that is, sentence, for he had already been> found guilty,) “to give upon the impeachment against the said earl.” * *> > “The next day, the Commons, with their speaker, being present at the bar of> the House (of Lords), * * the speaker of the House of Commons said as follows:> > “‘My Lords, the knights, citizens, and burgesses in Parliament assembled, in> the name of themselves, and of all the commons of Great Britain, did at this> bar impeach Thomas, Earl of Macclesfield, of high crimes and misdemeanors, and> did exhibit articles of impeachment against him, and have made good their> charge. I do, therefore, in the name of the knights, citizens, and burgesses,> in Parliament assembled, and of all the commons of Great Britain, demand> judgment (sentence) of your lordships against Thomas, Earl of Macclesfield,> for the said high crimes and misdemeanors.’> > “Then the Lord Chief Justice King, Speaker of the House of Lords, said: ‘Mr.> Speaker, the Lords are now ready to proceed to judgment in the case by you> mentioned.> > “‘Thomas, Earl of Macclesfield, the Lords have unanimously found you guilty of> high crimes and misdemeanors, charged on you by the impeachment of the House> of Commons, and do now, according to law, proceed to judgment against you,> which I am ordered to pronounce. Their lordships’ judgment is, and this high> court doth adjudge, that you, Thomas, Earl of Macclesfield, be fined in the> sum of thirty thousand pounds unto our sovereign lord the king; and that you> shall be imprisoned in the tower of London, and there kept in safe custody,> until you shall pay the said fine.’”—6 Hargrave’s State Trials, 762–3–4.This case shows that the principle of Magna Carta, that a man should besentenced only by his peers, was in force, and acted upon as law, in England, solately as 1725, (five hundred years after Magna Carta,) so far as it applied toa peer of the realm.But the same principle, on this point, that applies to a peer of the realm,applies to every freeman. The only difference between the two is, that the peersof the realm have had influence enough to preserve their constitutional rights;while the constitutional rights of the people have been trampled upon andrendered obsolete by the usurpation and corruption of the government and thecourts.SECTION V.THE OATHS OF JUDGES.As further proof that the legislation of the king, whether enacted with orwithout the assent and advice of his parliaments, was of no authority unless itwere consistent with the common law, and unless juries and judges saw fit toenforce it, it may be mentioned that it is probable that no judge in England wasever sworn to observe the laws enacted either by the king alone, or by the kingwith the advice and assent of parliament.The judges were sworn to “do equal law, and execution of right, to all theking’s subjects, rich and poor, without having regard to any person;” and thatthey will “deny no man common right;”[26] but they were not sworn to obey orexecute any statutes of the king, or of the king and parliament. Indeed, theyare virtually sworn not to obey any statutes that are against “common right,” orcontrary to “the common law,” or “law of the land;” but to “certify the kingthereof”—that is, notify him that his statutes are against the common law;—andthen proceed to execute the common law, notwithstanding such legislation to thecontrary. The words of the oath on this point are these:> “That ye deny no man common right by (virtue of) the king’s letters, nor none> other man’s, nor for none other cause; and in case any letters come to you> contrary to the law, (that is, the common law, as will be seen on reference to> the entire oath given in the note,) that ye do nothing by such letters, but> certify the king thereof and proceed to execute the law, (that is, the common> law,) notwithstanding the same letters.”When it is considered that the king was the sole legislative power, and that heexercised this power, to a great extent, by orders in council, and by writs and“letters” addressed oftentimes to some sheriff, or other person, and that hiscommands, when communicated to his justices, or any other person, “by letters,”or writs, under seal, had as much legal authority as Jaws promulgated in anyother form whatever, it will be seen that this oath of the justices absolutelyrequired that they disregard any legislation that was contrary to “commonright,” or “the common law,” and notify the king that it was contrary to commonright, or the common law, and then proceed to execute the common law,notwithstanding such legislation.[27]If there could be any doubt that such was the meaning of this oath, that doubtwould be removed by a statute passed by the king two years afterwards, whichfully explains this oath, as follows:> “Edward, by the Grace of God, &c., to the Sheriff of Stafford, greeting:> Because that by divers complaints made to us, we have perceived that the Law> of the Land, which we by our oath are bound to maintain, is the less well> kept, and the execution of the same disturbed many times by maintenance and> procurement, as well in the court as in the country; we greatly moved of> conscience in this matter, and for this cause desiring as much for the> pleasure of God, and ease and quietness of our subjects, as to save our> conscience, and for to save and keep our said oath, by the assent of the great> men and other wise men of our council, we have ordained these things> following:> > “First, we have commanded all our justices, that they shall from henceforth do> equal law and execution of right to all our subjects, rich and poor, without> having regard to any person, and without omitting to do right for any letters> or commandment which may come to them from us, or from any other, or by any> other cause. And if that any letters, writs, or commandments come to the> justices, or to other deputed to do law and right according to the usage of> the realm, in disturbance of the law, or of the execution of the same, or of> right to the parties, the justices and other aforesaid shall proceed and hold> their courts and processes, where the pleas and matters be depending before> them, as if no such letters, writs, or commandments were come to them; and> they shall certify us and our council of such commandments which be contrary> to the law, (that is, “the law of the land,” or common law,) as afore is> said.”[28] And to the intent that our justices shall do even right to all> people in the manner aforesaid, without more favor showing to one than to> another, we have ordained and caused our said justices to be sworn, that, they> shall not from henceforth, as long as they shall be in the office of justice,> take fee nor robe of any man, but of ourself, and that they shall take no gift> nor reward by themselves, nor by other, privily nor apertly, of any man that> hath to do before them by any way, except meat and drink, and that of small> value; and that they shall give no counsel to great men or small, in case> where we be party, or which do or may touch us in any point, upon pain to be> at our will, body, lands, and goods, to do thereof as shall please us, in case> they do contrary. And for this cause we have increased the fees of the same,> our justices, in such manner as it ought reasonably to suffice them.”—20> Edward III., ch. 1. (1346.)Other statutes of similar tenor have been enacted, as follows:> “It is accorded and established, that it shall not be commanded by the great> seal, nor the little seal, to disturb or delay common right; and though such> commandments do come, the justices shall not therefore leave (omit) to do> right an any point.”—St. 2 Edward III., ch. 8. (1328.)> “That by commandment of the great seal, or privy seal, no point of this> statute shall be put in delay; nor that the justices of whatsoever place it be> shall let (omit) to do the common law, by commandment, which shall come to> them under the great seal, or the privy seal.”—14 Edward III, st. 1, ch. 14.> (1340.)> “It is ordained and established, that neither letters of the signet, nor of> the king’s privy seal, shall be from henceforth sent in damage or prejudice of> the realm, nor in disturbance of the law” (the common law).—11 Richard II.,> ch. 10. (1387.)It is perfectly apparent from these statutes, and from the oath administered tothe justices, that it was a matter freely confessed by the king himself, thathis statutes were of no validity, if contrary to the common law, or “commonright.”The oath of the justices, before given, is, I presume, the same that has beenadministered to judges in England from the day when it was first prescribed tothem, (1344,) until now. I do not find from the English statutes that the oathhas ever been changed. The Essay on Grand Juries, before referred to, andsupposed to have been written by Lord Somers, mentions this oath (page 73) asbeing still administered to judges, that is, in the time of Charles II., morethan three hundred years after the oath was first ordained. If the oath hasnever been changed, it follows that judges have not only never been sworn tosupport any statutes whatever of the king, or of parliament, but that, for fivehundred years past, they actually have been sworn to treat as invalid allstatutes that were contrary to the common law.SECTION VI.THE CORONATION OATH.That the legislation of the king was of no authority over a jury, is furtherproved by the oath taken by the kings at their coronation. This oath seems tohave been substantially the same, from the time of the Saxon kings, down to theseventeenth century, as will be seen from the authorities hereafter given.The purport of the oath is, that the king swears to maintain the law of theland—that is, the common law. In other words, he swears “to concede and preserveto the English people the laws and customs conceded to them by the ancient,just, and pious English kings, * * and especially the laws, customs, andliberties conceded to the clergy and people by the illustrious king Edward;” * *and “the just laws and customs which the common people have chosen, (quas vulguselegit).”These are the same laws and customs which were called by the general name of“the law of the land,” or “the common law,” and, with some slight additions,were embodied in Magna Carta.This oath not only forbids the king to enact any statutes contrary to the commonlaw, but it proves that his statutes could be of no authority over theconsciences of a jury; since, as has already been sufficiently shown, it was onepart of this very common law itself,—that is, of the ancient “laws, customs, andliberties,” mentioned in the oath,—that juries should judge of all questionsthat came before them, according to their own consciences, independently of thelegislation of the king.It was impossible that this right of the jury could subsist consistently withany right, on the part of the king, to impose any authoritative legislation uponthem. His oath, therefore, to maintain the law of the land, or the ancient“laws, customs, and liberties,” was equivalent to an oath that he would neverassume to impose laws upon juries, as imperative rules of decision, or take fromthem the right to try all cases according to their own consciences. It is alsoan admission that he had no constitutional power to do so, if he should everdesire it. This oath, then, is conclusive proof that his legislation was of noauthority with a jury, and that they were under no obligation whatever toenforce it, unless it coincided with their own ideas of justice.The ancient coronation oath is printed with the Statutes of the Realm, vol. i.,p. 168, and is as follows:[29]TRANSLATION.“Form of the Oath of the King of England, on his Coronation.(The Archbishop of Canterbury, to whom, of right and custom of the Church ofCanterbury, ancient and approved, it pertains to anoint and crown the kings ofEngland, on the day of the coronation of the king, and before the king iscrowned, shall propound the underwritten questions to the king.)The laws and customs, conceded to the English people by the ancient, just, andpious English kings, will you concede and preserve to the same people, with theconfirmation of an oath? and especially the laws, customs, and libertiesconceded to the clergy and people by the illustrious king Edward?(And the king shall answer,) I do concede, and will preserve them, and confirmthem by my oath.Will you preserve to the church of God, the clergy, and the people, entire peaceand harmony in God, according to your powers?(And the king shall answer,) I will.In all your judgments, will you cause equal and right justice and discretion tobe done, in mercy and truth, according to your powers?(And the king shall answer,) I will.Do you concede that the just laws and customs, which the common people havechosen, shall be preserved; and do you promise that they shall be protected byyou, and strengthened to the honor of God, according to your powers?(And the king shall answer,) I concede and promise.”The language used in the last of these questions, “Do you concede that the justlaws and customs, which the common people have chosen, (quas vulgus elegit,)shall be preserved?” &c., is worthy of especial notice, as showing that thelaws, which were to be preserved, were not necessarily all the laws which thekings enacted, but only such of them as the common people had selected orapproved.And how had the common people made known their approbation or selection of theselaws? Plainly, in no other way than this—that the juries composed of the commonpeople had voluntarily enforced them. The common people had no other legal formof making known their approbation of particular laws.The word “concede,” too, is an important word. In the English statutes it isusually translated grant—as if with an intention to indicate that “the laws,customs, and liberties” of the English people were mere privileges, granted tothem by the king; whereas it should be translated concede, to indicate simply anacknowledgment, on the part of the king, that such were the laws, customs, andliberties, which had been chosen and established by the people themselves, andof right belonged to them, and which he was bound to respect.I will now give some authorities to show that the foregoing oath has, insubstance, been the coronation oath from the times of William the Conqueror,(1066,) down to the time of James the First, and probably until 1688.It will be noticed, in the quotation from Kelham, that he says this oath (or theoath of William the Conqueror) is “in sense and substance the very same withthat which the Saxon kings used to take at their coronations.”Hale says:> “Yet the English were very zealous for them,” (that is, for the laws of Edward> the Confessor,) “no less or otherwise than they are at this time for the Great> Charter; insomuch that they were never satisfied till the said laws were> reënforced, and mingled, for the most part, with the coronation oath of king> William I., and some of his successors.”—1 Hale’s History of Common Law, 157.> Also, “William, on his coronation, had sworn to govern by the laws of Edward> the Confessor, some of which had been reduced into writing, but the greater> part consisted of the immemorial customs of the realm.”—Ditto, p. 202, note L.Kelham says:> “Thus stood the laws of England at the entry of William I., and it seems plain> that the laws, commonly called the laws of Edward the Confessor, were at that> time the standing laws of the kingdom, and considered the great rule of their> rights and liberties; and that the English were so zealous for them, ‘that> they were never satisfied till the said laws were reënforced, and mingled, for> the most part, with the coronation oath.’ Accordingly, we find that this great> conqueror, at his coronation on the Christmas day succeeding his victory, took> an oath at the altar of St. Peter, Westminster, in sense and substance the> very same with that which the Saxon kings used to take at their coronations. *> * And at Barkhamstead, in the fourth year of his reign, in the presence of> Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, for the quieting of the people, he swore> that he would inviolably observe the good and approved ancient laws which had> been made by the devout and pious kings of England, his ancestors, and chiefly> by King Edward; and we are told that the people then departed in good> humor.”—Kelham’s Preliminary Discourse to the Laws of William the Conqueror.> See, also, 1 Hale’s History of the Common Law, 186.> Crabbe says that William the Conqueror “solemnly swore that he would observe> the good and approved laws of Edward the Confessor.”—Crabbe’s History of the> English Law, p. 43.The successors of William, up to the time of Magna Carta, probably all took thesame oath, according to the custom of the kingdom; although there may be nohistorical accounts extant of the oath of each separate king. But history tellsus specially that Henry I., Stephen, and Henry II., confirmed these ancient lawsand customs. It appears, also, that the barons desired of John (what heafterwards granted by Magna Carta) “that the laws and liberties of King Edward,with other privileges granted to the kingdom and church of England, might beconfirmed, as they were contained in the charters of Henry the First; furtheralleging, that at the time of his absolution, he promised by his oath to observethese very laws and liberties.”—Echard’s History of England, p. 105–6.It would appear, from the following authorities, that since Magna Carta the formof the coronation oath has been “to maintain the law of the land,”—meaning thatlaw as embodied in Magna Carta. Or perhaps it is more probable that the ancientform has been still observed, but that, as its substance and purport were “tomaintain the law of the land,” this latter form of expression has been used, inthe instances here cited, from motives of brevity and convenience. Thissupposition is the more probable, from the fact that I find no statuteprescribing a change in the form of the oath until 1688.That Magna Carta was considered as embodying “the law of the land,” or “commonlaw,” is shown by a statute passed by Edward I., wherein he “grants,” orconcedes,> “That the Charter of Liberties and the Charter of the Forest * * shall be kept> in every point, without breach, * * and that our justices, sheriffs, mayors,> and other ministers, which, under us, have the laws of our land[30] to guide,> shall allow the said charters pleaded before them in judgment, in all their> points, that is, to wit, the Great Charter as the Common Law, and the Charter> of the Forest for the wealth of the realm.> > “And we will, that if any judgment be given from henceforth, contrary to the> points of the charters aforesaid, by the justices, or by any other our> ministers that hold plea before them against the points of the charters, it> shall be undone, and holden for naught.”—25 Edward ch. 1 and 2. (1297.)Blackstone also says:> “It is agreed by all our historians that the Great Charter of King John was,> for the most part, compiled from the ancient customs of the realm, or the laws> of Edward the Confessor; by which they usually mean the old common law which> was established under our Saxon princes.”—Blackstone’s Introduction to the> Charters. See Blackstone’s Law Tracts, 289.Crabbe says:> “It is admitted, on all hands, that it (Magna Carta) contains nothing but what> was confirmatory of the common law, and the ancient usages of the realm, and> is, properly speaking, only an enlargement of the charter of Henry I., and his> successors.”—Crabbe’s History of the English Law, p. 127.That the coronation oath of the kings subsequent to Magna Carta was, insubstance, if not in form, “to maintain this law of the land, or common law,” isshown by a statute of Edward Third, commencing as follows:> “Edward, by the Grace of God, &c., &c., to the Sheriff of Stafford, Greeting:> Because that by divers complaints made to us, we have perceived that the law> of the land, which we by oath are bound to maintain,” &c.—St. 20 Edward III.> (1346.)The following extract from Lord Somers’ tract on Grand Juries shows that thecoronation oath continued the same as late as 1616, (four hundred years afterMagna Carta.) He says:> “King James, in his speech to the judges, in the Star Chamber, Anno 1616, told> them, ‘That he had, after many years, resolved to renew his oath, made at his> coronation, concerning justice, and the promise therein contained for> maintaining the law of the land.’ And, in the next page save one, says, ‘I was> sworn to maintain the law of the land, and therefore had been perjured if I> had broken it. God is my judge, I never intended it.’”—Somers on Grand Juries,> p. 82.In 1688, the coronation oath was changed by act of Parliament, and the king wasmade to swear:> “To govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the dominions thereto> belonging, according to the statutes in Parliament agreed on, and the laws and> customs of the same.”—St. 1 William and Mary, ch. 6. (1688.)The effect and legality of this oath will hereafter be considered. For thepresent it is sufficient to show, as has been already sufficiently done, thatfrom the Saxon times until at least as lately as 1616, the coronation oath hasbeen, in substance, to maintain the law of the land, or the common law, meaningthereby the ancient Saxon customs, as embodied in the laws of Alfred, of Edwardthe Confessor, and finally in Magna Carta.It may here be repeated that this oath plainly proves that the statutes of theking were of no authority over juries, if inconsistent with their ideas ofright; because it was one part of the common law that juries should try allcauses according to their own consciences, any legislation of the king to thecontrary notwithstanding.[31]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] Hale says:> “The trial by jury of twelve men was the usual trial among the Normans, in> most suits; especially in assizes, et juris utrum.”—1 Hale’s History, of the> Common Law, 219.This was in Normandy, before the conquest of England by the Normans. See Ditto,p. 218.Crabbe says:> “It cannot be denied that the practice of submitting causes to the decision of> twelve men was universal among all the northern tribes (of Europe) from the> very remotest antiquity.”—Crabbe’s History of the English Law, p. 32.[2] “The people, who in every general council or assembly could oppose anddethrone their sovereigns, were in little dread of their encroachments on theirliberties; and kings, who found sufficient employment in keeping possession oftheir crowns, would not likely attack the more important privileges of theirsubjects.”[3] This office was afterwards committed to sheriffs. But even while the courtwas held by the lord, “the Lord was not judge, but the Pares (peers)only.”—Gilbert on the Court of Exchequer, 61–2.[4] The opinion expressed in the text, that the Witan had no legislativeauthority, is corroborated by the following authorities:> “From the fact that the new laws passed by the king and the Witan were laid> before the shire-mote, (county court,) we should be almost justified in the> inference that a second sanction was necessary before they could have the> effect of law in that particular county.”—Dunham’s Middle Ages, Sec. 2, B. 2,> Ch. 1. 57 Lardner’s Cab. Cyc., 63.The “second sanction” required to give the legislation of the king and Witan theeffect of law, was undoubtedly, I think, as a general thing, the sanction of ajury. I know of no evidence whatever that laws were ever submitted to popularvote in the county courts, as this author seems to suppose possible. Anothermode, sometimes resorted to for obtaining the sanction of the people to the lawsof the Witan, was, it seems, to persuade the people themselves to swear toobserve them. Mackintosh says:> “The preambles of the laws (of the Witan) speak of the infinite number of> liegemen who attended, as only applauding the measures of the assembly. But> this applause was neither so unimportant to the success of the measures, nor> so precisely distinguished from a share in legislation, as those who read> history with a modern eye might imagine. It appears that under Athelstan> expedients were resorted to, to obtain a consent to the law from great bodies> of the people in their districts, which their numbers rendered impossible in a> national assembly. That monarch appears to have sent commissioners to hold> shire-gemotes or county meetings, where they proclaimed the laws made by the> king and his counsellors, which, being acknowledged and sworn to at these> folk-motes (meetings of the people) became, by their assent, completely> binding on the whole nation.”—Mackintosh’s Hist. of England, Ch. 2. 45> Lardner’s Cab. Cyc., 75.[5] Page 31.[6] Hallam says, “It was, however, to the county court that an English freemanchiefly looked for the maintenance of his civil rights.”—2 Middle Ages, 392.Also, “This (the county court) was the great constitutional judicature in allquestions of civil right.”—Ditto, 395.Also, “The liberties of these Anglo-Saxon thanes were chiefly secured, next totheir swords and their free spirits, by the inestimable right of deciding civiland criminal suits in their own county courts.”—Ditto, 399.[7] “Alfred may, in one sense, be called the founder of these laws, (the Saxon,)for until his time they were an unwritten code, but he expressly says, ‘that I,Alfred, collected the good laws of our forefathers into one code, and also Iwrote them down’—which is a decisive fact in the history of our laws well worthnoting.”—Introduction to Gilbert’s History of the Common Pleas, p. 2, note.Kelham says, “Let us consult our own lawyers and historians, and they will tellus * * that Alfred, Edgar, and Edward the Confessor, were the great compilersand restorers of the English Laws.”—Kelham’s Preliminary Discourse to the Lawsof William the Conqueror, p. 12. Appendix to Kelham’s Dictionary of the NormanLanguage.“He (Alfred) also, like another Theodosius, collected the various customs thathe found dispersed in the kingdom, and reduced and digested them into oneuniform system, or code of laws, in his som-bec, or liber judicialis (judicialbook). This he compiled for the use of the court baron, hundred and countycourt, the court-leet and sheriff’s tourn, tribunals which he established forthe trial of all causes, civil and criminal, in the very districts wherein thecomplaints arose.”—4 Blackstone, 411.Alfred himself says, “Hence I, King Alfred, gathered these together, andcommanded many of those to be written down which our forefathers observed—thosewhich I liked—and those which I did not like, by the advice of my Witan, I threwaside. For I durst not venture to set down in writing over many of my own, sinceI knew not what among them would please those that should come after us. Butthose which I met with either of the days of me, my kinsman, or of Offa, King ofMercia, or of Æthelbert, who was the first of the English who receivedbaptism—those which appeared to me the justest—I have here collected, andabandoned the others. Then I, Alfred, King of the West Saxons, showed these toall my Witan, and they then said that they were all willing to observethem.”—Laws of Alfred, translated by R. Price, prefixed to Mackintosh’s Historyof England, vol. 1. 45 Lardner’s Cab. Cyc.“King Edward * * projected and begun what his grandson, King Edward theConfessor, afterwards completed, viz., one uniform digest or body of laws to beobserved throughout the whole kingdom, being probably no more than a revival ofKing Alfred’s code, with some improvements suggested by necessity andexperience, particularly the incorporating some of the British, or, rather,Mercian customs, and also such of the Danish (customs) as were reasonable andapproved, into the West Saxon Lage, which was still the ground-work of thewhole. And this appears to be the best supported and most plausible conjecture,(for certainty is not to be expected,) of the rise and original of thatadmirable system of maxims and unwritten customs which is now known by the nameof the common law, as extending its authority universally over all the realm,and which is doubtless of Saxon parentage.”—4 Blackstone, 412.“By the Lem Terræ and Leat Regni is understood the laws of Edward the Confessor,confirmed and enlarged as they were by William the Conqueror; and thisConstitution or Code of Laws is what even to this day are called ‘The Common Lawof the Land.’”—Introduction to Gilbert’s History of the Common Pleas, p. 22,note.[8] Not the conqueror of the English people, (as the friends of libertymaintain,) but only of Harold the usurper.—See Hale’s History of the Common Law,ch. 5.[9] For all these codes see Wilkins’ Laws of the Anglo-Saxons.“Being regulations adapted to existing institutions, the Anglo-Saxon statutesare concise and technical, alluding to the law which was then living and invigor, rather than defining it. The same clauses and chapters are often repeatedword for word, in the statutes of subsequent kings, showing that enactmentswhich bear the appearance of novelty are merely declaratory. Consequently theappearance of a law, seemingly for the first time, is by no means to beconsidered as a proof that the matter which it contains is new; nor can we tracethe progress of the Anglo-Saxon institutions with any degree of certainty, byfollowing the dates of the statutes in which we find them first noticed. Allarguments founded on the apparent chronology of the subjects included in thelaws, are liable to great fallacies. Furthermore, a considerable portion of theAnglo-Saxon law was never recorded in writing. There can be no doubt but thatthe rules of inheritance were well established and defined; yet we have not asingle law, and hardly a single document from which the course of the descent ofland can be inferred. * * Positive proof cannot be obtained of the commencementof any institution, because the first written law relating to it may possibly bemerely confirmatory or declaratory; neither can the non-existence of anyinstitution be inferred from the absence of direct evidence. Written laws weremodified and controlled by customs of which no trace can be discovered, untilafter the lapse of centuries, although those usages must have been in constantvigor during the long interval of silence.”—1 Palgrave’s Rise and Progress ofthe English Commonwealth, 58–9.[10] Rapin says, “The customs now practised in England are, for the most part,the same as the Anglo-Saxons brought with them from Germany.”—Rapin’sDissertation on the Government of the Anglo-Saxons, vol. 2, Oct. Ed., p. 138.See Kelham’s Discourse before named.[11] Hallam says, “The county of Sussex contains sixty-five (‘hundreds’); thatof Dorset forty-three; while Yorkshire has only twenty-six; and Lancashire butsix.”—2 Middle Ages, 391.[12] Excepting also matters pertaining to the collection of the revenue, whichwere determined in the king’s court of exchequer. But even in this court it wasthe law “that none be amerced but by his peers.”—Mirror of Justices, 49.[13] “For the English laws, although not written, may, as it should seem, andthat without any absurdity, be termed laws, (since this itself is law—that whichpleases the prince has the force of law,) I mean those laws which it is evidentwere promulgated by the advice of the nobles and the authority of the prince,concerning doubts to be settled in their assembly. For if from the mere want ofwriting only, they should not be considered laws, then, unquestionably, writingwould seem to confer more authority upon laws themselves, than either the equityof the persons constituting, or the reason of those framing them.”—Glanville’sPreface, p. 38. (Glanville was chief justice of Henry II., 1180.) 2 Turner’sHistory of the Anglo-Saxons, 280.[14] Mackintosh’s History of England, ch. 3. Lardner’s Cabinet Cyclopædia, 266.[15] If the laws of the king were received as authoritative by the juries, whatoccasion was there for his appointing special commissioners for the trial ofoffences, without the intervention of a jury, as he frequently did, in manifestand acknowledged violation of Magna Carta, and “the law of the land?” Theseappointments were undoubtedly made for no other reason than that the juries werenot sufficiently subservient, but judged according to their own notions ofright, instead of the will of the king—whether the latter were expressed in hisstatutes, or by his judges.[16] Of course, Mr. Reeve means to be understood that, in the hundred court, andcourt-leet, the jurors were the judges, as he declares them to have been in thecounty court; otherwise the “bailiff” or “steward” must have been judge.[17] The jurors were sometimes called “assessors,” because they assessed, ordetermined the amount of fines and amercements to be imposed.[18] “The barons of the Hundred” were the freeholders. Hallam says: “The wordbaro, originally meaning only a man, was of very large significance, and is notunfrequently applied to common freeholders, as in the phrase court-baron.”—3Middle Ages, 14–15.Blackstone says: “The court-baron * * is a court of common law, and it is thecourt of the barons, by which name the freeholders were sometimes ancientlycalled; for that it is held before the freeholders who owe suit and service tothe manor.”—3 Blackstone, 33.[19] The ancient jury courts kept no records, because those who composed thecourts could neither make nor read records. Their decisions were preserved bythe memories of the jurors and other persons present.[20] Stuart says:“The courts, or civil arrangements, which were modelled in Germany, preservedthe independence of the people; and having followed the Saxons into England, andcontinuing their importance, they supported the envied liberty we boast of. * *“As a chieftain led out his retainers to the field, and governed them duringwar; so in peace he summoned them together, and exerted a civil jurisdiction. Hewas at once their captain and their judge. They constituted his court; andhaving inquired with him into the guilt of those of their order whom justice hadaccused, they assisted him to enforce his decrees.“This court (the court-baron) was imported into England; but the innovationwhich conquest introduced into the fashion of the times altered somewhat itsappearance. * *“The head or lord of the manor called forth his attendants to his hall, * * Heinquired into the breaches of custom, and of justice, which were committedwithin the precincts of his territory; and with his followers, who sat with him.as judges, he determined in all matters of debt, and of trespass to a certainamount. He possessed a similar jurisdiction with the chieftain in Germany, andhis tenants enjoyed an equal authority with the German retainers.“But a mode of administration which intrusted so much power to the great couldnot long be exercised without blame or injustice. The German, guided by thecandor of his mind, and entering into all his engagements with the greatestardor, perceived not, at first, that the chieftain to whom he submitted hisdisputes might be swayed, in the judgments he pronounced, by partiality,prejudice, or interest; and that the influence he maintained with his followerswas too strong to be restrained by justice. Experience instructed him of hiserror; he acknowledged the necessity of appealing from his lord; and the courtof the Hundred was erected.“This establishment was formed both in Germany and England, by the inhabitantsof a certain division, who extended their jurisdiction over the territory theyoccupied.[20a] They bound themselves under a penalty to assemble at statedtimes; and having elected the wisest to preside over them, they judged, not onlyall civil and criminal matters, but of those also which regarded religion andthe priesthood. The judicial power thus invested in the people was extensive;they were able to preserve their rights, and attended this court in arms.“As the communication, however, and intercourse, of the individuals of a Germancommunity began to be wider, and more general, as their dealings enlarged, andas disputes arose among the members of different hundreds, the insufficiency ofthese courts for the preservation of order was gradually perceived. The shyremote, therefore, or county court, was instituted; and it formed the chief sourceof justice both in Germany and England.“The powers, accordingly, which had been enjoyed by the court of the hundred,were considerably impaired. It decided no longer concerning capital offences; itdecided not concerning matters of liberty, and the property of estates, or ofslaves; its judgments, in every case, became subject to review; and it lostentirely the decision of causes, when it delayed too long to consider them.“Every subject of claim or contention was brought, in the first instance, or byappeal, to the county court; and the earl, or eorldorman, who presided there,was active to put the laws in execution. He repressed the disorders which fellout within the circuit of his authority; and the least remission in his duty, orthe least fraud he committed, was complained of and punished. He was electedfrom among the great, and was above the temptation of a bribe; but, to encouragehis activity, he was presented with a share of the territory he governed, or wasentitled to a proportion of the fines and profits of justice. Every man, in hisdistrict, was bound to inform him concerning criminals, and to assist him tobring them to trial; and, as in rude and violent times the poor and helplesswere ready to be oppressed by the strong, he was instructed particularly todefend them.“His court was ambulatory, and assembled only twice a year, unless thedistribution of justice required that its meetings should be oftener. Everyfreeholder in the county was obliged to attend it; and should he refuse thisservice, his possessions were seized, and he was forced to find surety for hisappearance. The neighboring earls held not their courts on the same day; and,what seems very singular, no judge was allowed, alter meals, to exercise hisoffice.“The druids also, or priests, in Germany, as we had formerly occasion to remark,and the clergy in England, exercised a jurisdiction in the hundred and countycourts. They instructed the people in religious duties, and in matters regardingthe priesthood; and the princes, earls, or eorldormen, related to them the lawsand customs of the community. These judges were mutually a check to each other;but it was expected that they should agree in their judgments, and shouldwillingly unite their efforts for the public interest.[20b]“But the prince or earl performed not, at all times, in person, the obligationsof his office. The enjoyment of ease and of pleasure, to which in Germany he haddelivered himself over, when disengaged from war, and the mean idea he conceivedof the drudgery of civil affairs, made him often delegate to an inferior personthe distribution of justice in his district. The same sentiments wereexperienced by the Saxon nobility; and the service which they owed by theirtenures, and the high employments they sustained, called them often from themanagement of their counties. The progress, too, of commerce, giving anintricacy to cases, and swelling the civil code, added to the difficulty oftheir office, and made them averse to its duties. Sheriffs, therefore, ordeputies, were frequently appointed to transact their business; and though thesewere at first under some subordination to the earls, they grew at length to beentirely independent of them. The connection of jurisdiction and territoryceasing to prevail, and the civil being separated from the ecclesiastical power,they became the sole and proper officers for the direction of justice in thecounties.“The hundred, however, and county courts, were not equal of themselves for thepurposes of jurisdiction and order. It was necessary that a court should beerected, of supreme authority, where the disputes of the great should bedecided, where the disagreeing sentiments of judges should be reconciled, andwhere protection should be given to the people against their fraud andinjustice.“The princes accordingly, or chief nobility, in the German communities,assembled together to judge of such matters. The Saxon nobles continued thisprerogative; and the king, or, in his absence, the chief justiciary, watchedover their deliberations. But it was not on every trivial occasion that thiscourt interested itself. In smaller concerns, justice was refused during threesessions of the hundred, and claimed without effect, at four courts of thecounty, before there could lie an appeal to it.“So gradually were these arrangements established, and so naturally did thevarying circumstances in the situation of the Germans and Anglo-Saxons directthose successive improvements which the preservation of order, and the advantageof society, called them to adopt. The admission of the people into the courts ofjustice preserved, among the former, that equality of ranks for which they wereremarkable; and it helped to overturn, among the latter, those enviousdistinctions which the feudal system tended to introduce, and prevented thatvenality in judges, and those arbitrary proceedings, which the growingattachment to interest, and the influence of the crown, might otherwise haveoccasioned.”—Stuart on the Constitution of England, p. 222 to 245.“In the Anglo-Saxon period, accordingly, twelve only were elected; and these,together with the judge, or presiding officer of the district, being sworn toregard justice, and the voice of reason, or conscience, all causes weresubmitted to them.”—Ditto, p. 260.“Before the orders of men were very nicely distinguished, the jurors wereelected from the same rank. When, however, a regular subordination of orders wasestablished, and when a knowledge of property had inspired the necessitous withenvy, and the rich with contempt, every man was tried by his equals. The samespirit of liberty which gave rise to this regulation attended its progress. Norcould monarchs assume a more arbitrary method of proceeding. ‘I will not’ (saidthe Earl of Cornwall to his sovereign) ‘render up my castles, nor depart thekingdom, but by judgment of my peers.’ Of this institution, so wisely calculatedfor the preservation of liberty, all our historians have pronounced theeulogium.”—Ditto, p. 262–3.Blackstone says:“The policy of our ancient constitution, as regulated and established by thegreat Alfred, was to bring justice home to every man’s door, by constituting asmany courts of judicature as there are manors and towns in the kingdom; whereininjuries were redressed, in an easy and expeditious manner, by the suffrage ofneighbors and friends. These little courts, however, communicated with others ofa larger jurisdiction, and those with others of a still greater power; ascendinggradually from the lowest to the supreme courts, which were respectivelyconstituted to correct the errors of the inferior ones, and to determine suchcauses as, by reason of their weight and difficulty, demanded a more solemndiscussion. The course of justice flowing in large streams from the king, as thefountain, to his superior courts of record; and being then subdivided intosmaller channels, till the whole and every part of the kingdom were plentifullywatered and refreshed. An institution that seems highly agreeable to thedictates of natural reason, as well as of more enlightened policy. * * *“These inferior courts, at least the name and form of them, still continue inour legal constitution; but as the superior court3 of record have, in practice,obtained a concurrent original jurisdiction, and as there is, besides, a powerof removing plaints or actions thither from all the inferior jurisdictions; uponthese accounts (among others) it has happened that these petty tribunals havefallen into decay, and almost into oblivion; whether for the better or the worsemay be matter of some speculation, when we consider, on the one hand, theincrease of expense and delay, and, on the other, the more able and impartialdecisions that follow from this change of jurisdiction.“The order I shall observe in discoursing on these several courts, constitutedfor the redress of civil injuries, (for with those of a jurisdiction merelycriminal I shall not at present concern myself,[20c]) will be by beginning withthe lowest, and those whose jurisdiction, though public and generally dispersedthrough the kingdom, is yet (with regard to each particular court) confined tovery narrow limits; and so ascending gradually to those of the most extensiveand transcendent power.”—3 Blackstone, 30 to 32.“The court-baron is a court incident to every manor in the kingdom, to be holdenby the steward within the said manor. This court-baron is of two natures; theone is a customary court, of which we formerly spoke, appertaining entirely tothe copy-holders, in which their estates are transferred by surrender andadmittance, and other matters transacted relative to their tenures only. Theother, of which we now speak, is a court of common law, and it is a court of thebarons, by which name the freeholders were sometimes anciently called; for thatit is held by the freeholders who owe suit and service to the manor, the stewardbeing rather the registrar than the judge. These courts, though in their naturedistinct, are frequently confounded together. The court we are now considering,viz., the freeholders court, was composed of the lord’s tenants, who were thepares (equals) of each other, and were bound by their feudal tenure to assisttheir lord in the dispensation of domestic justice. This was formerly held everythree weeks; and its most important business is to determine, by writ of right,all controversies relating to the right of lands within the manor. It may alsohold plea of any personal actions, of debt, trespass in the case, or the like,where the debt or damages do not amount to forty shillings; which is the samesum, or three marks, that bounded the jurisdiction of the ancient Gothic courtsin their lowest instance, or fierding courts, so called because four wereinstituted within every superior district or hundred.”—3 Blackstone, 33, 34.“A hundred court is only a larger court-baron, being held for all theinhabitants of a particular hundred, instead of a manor. The free suitors arehere also the judges, and the steward the registrar, as in the case of acourt-baron. It is likewise no court of record, resembling the former at allpoints, except that in point of territory it is of greater jurisdiction. This issaid by Sir Edward Coke to have been derived out of the county court for theease of the people, that they might have justice done to them at their owndoors, without any charge or loss of time; but its institution was probablycoeval with that of hundreds themselves, which were formerly observed to havebeen introduced, though not invented, by Alfred, being derived from the polityof the ancient Germans. The centeni, we may remember, were the principalinhabitants of a district composed of different villages, originally in number ahundred, but afterward only called by that name, and who probably gave the samedenomination to the district out of which they were chosen. Cæsar speakspositively of the judicial power exercised in their hundred courts andcourts-baron. ‘Princeps regiorum atque pagorum’ (which we may fairly construethe lords of hundreds and manors) ‘inter suos jus dicunt, controversias queminuunt.’ (The chiefs of the country and the villages declare the law amongthem, and abate controversies.) And Tacitus, who had examined their constitutionstill more attentively, informs us not only of the authority of the lords, butthat of the centeni, the hundreders, or jury, who were taken out of the commonfreeholders, and had themselves a share in the determination. ‘Eliguntur inconciliis et principes, qui jura per pagos vicosque reddunt, centeni singulis,ex plebe comites concilium simul et anctoritas adsunt.’ (The princes are chosenin the assemblies, who administer the laws throughout the towns and villages,and with each one are associated an hundred companions, taken from the people,for purposes both of counsel and authority.) This hundred court was denominatedhæreda in the Gothic constitution. But this court, as causes are equally liableto removal from hence as from the common court-baron, and by the same writs, andmay also be reviewed by writ of false judgment, is therefore fallen into equaldisuse with regard to the trial of actions.”—3 Blackstone, 34, 35.“The county court is a court incident to the jurisdiction of the sheriff. It isnot a court of record, but may hold pleas of debt, or damages, under the valueof forty shillings; over some of which causes these inferior courts have, by theexpress words of the statute of Gloucester, (6 Edward I., ch. 8,) a jurisdictiontotally exclusive of the king’s superior courts. * * The county court may alsohold plea of many real actions, and of all personal actions to any amount, byvirtue of a special writ, called a justicies, which is a writ empowering thesheriff, for the sake of despatch, to do the same justice in his county court asmight otherwise be had at Westminster. The freeholders of the county court arethe real judges in this court, and the sheriff is the ministerial officer. * * *In modern times, as proceedings are removable from hence into the king’ssuperior courts, by writ of pone or recordari, in the same manner as fromhundred courts and courts-baron, and as the same writ of false judgment may behad in nature of a writ of error, this has occasioned the same disuse ofbringing actions therein.”—3 Blackstone, 36, 37.“Upon the whole, we cannot but admire the wise economy and admirable provisionof our ancestors in settling the distribution of justice in a method so wellcalculated for cheapness, expedition, and ease. By the constitution which theyestablished, all trivial debts, and injuries of small consequence, were to berecovered or redressed in every man’s own county, hundred, or perhaps parish.”—3Blackstone, 59.[20a] “It was the freemen in Germany, and the possessors of land in England, whowere suitors (jurors) in the hundred court. These ranks of men were the same.The alteration which had happened in relation to property had invested theGerman freemen with land at territory.”[20b] It would be wholly erroneous, I think, to infer from this statement ofStuart, that either the “priests, princes, earls, or eorldormen” exercised anyauthority over the jury in the trial of causes, in the way of dictating the lawto them. Henry’s account of this matter doubtless gives a much more accuraterepresentation of the truth. He says that anciently> “The meeting (the county court) was opened with a discourse by the bishop,> explaining, out of the Scriptures and ecclesiastical canons, their several> duties as good Christians and members of the church. After this, the alderman,> or one of his assessors, made a discourse on the laws of the land, and the> duties of good subjects and good citizens. When these preliminaries were over,> they proceeded to try and determine, first the causes of the church, next the> pleas of the crown, and last of all the controversies of private parties.”—3> Henry’s History of Great Britain, 348.> > This view is corroborated by Tyrrell’s Introduction to the History of England,> p. 83–84, and by Spence’s Origin of the Laws and Political Institutions of> Modern Europe, p. 447, and the note on the same page. Also by a law of Canute> to this effect, In every county let there be twice a year an assembly, whereat> the bishop and the earl shall be present, the one to instruct the people in> divine, the other in human, laws.—Wilkins, p. 136.[20c] There was no distinction between the civil and criminal courts, as to therights or powers of juries.[21] 1 Blackstone, 63–67.[22] This quaint and curious book (Smith’s Commonwealth of England) describesthe minutiæ of trials, giving in detail the mode of impanelling the jury, andthen the conduct of the lawyers, witnesses, and court. I give the followingextracts, tending to show that the judges impose no law upon the juries, ineither civil or criminal cases, but only require them to determine the causesaccording to their consciences.In civil causes he says:> “When it is thought that it is enough pleaded before them, and the witnesses> have said what they can, one of the judges, with a brief and pithy> recapitulation, reciteth to the twelve in sum the arguments of the sergeants> of either side, that which the witnesses have declared, and the chief points> of the evidence showed in writing, and once again putteth them in mind of the> issue, and sometime giveth it them in writing, delivering to them the evidence> which is showed on either part, if any be, (evidence here is called writings> of contracts, authentical after the manner of England, that is to say,> written, sealed, and delivered,) and biddeth them go together.”—p. 74.This is the whole account given of the charge to the jury.In criminal cases, after the witnesses have been heard, and the prisoner hassaid what lie pleases in his defence, the book proceeds:> “When the judge hath heard them say enough, he asketh if they can say any> more: If they say no, then he turneth his speech to the inquest. ‘Good men,> (saith he,) ye of the inquest, ye have heard what these men say against the> prisoner. You have also heard what the prisoner can say for himself. Have an> eye to your oath, and to your duty, and do that which God shall put in your> minds to the discharge of your consciences, and mark well what is said.’”—p.> 92.This is the whole account given of the charge In a criminal ease.The following statement goes to confirm the same idea, that jurors in Englandhave formerly understood it to be their right and duty to judge only accordingto their consciences, and not to submit to any dictation from the court, eitheras to law or fact.> “If having pregnant evidence, nevertheless, the twelve do acquit the> malefactor, which they will do sometime, especially if they perceive either> one of the justices or of the judges, or some other man, to pursue too much> and too maliciously the death of the prisoner, * * the prisoner escapeth; but> the twelve (are) not only rebuked by the judges, but also threatened of> punishment; and many times commanded to appear in the Star-Chamber, or before> the Privy Council for the matter. But this threatening chanceth oftener than> the execution thereof; and the twelve answer with most gentle words, they did> it according to their consciences, and pray the judges to be good unto them,> they did as they thought right, and as they accorded all, and so it passeth> away for the most part.”—p. 100.The account given of the trial of a peer of the realm corroborates the samepoint:> “If any duke, marquis; or any other of the degrees of a baron, or above, lord> of the Parliament, be appeached of treason, or any other capital crime, he is> judged by his peers and equals; that is, the yeomanry doth not go upon him,> but an inquest of the Lords of Parliament, and they give their voice not one> for all, but each severally as they do in Parliament, being (beginning) at the> youngest lord. And for judge one lord sitteth, who is constable of England for> that day. The judgment once given, he breaketh his staff and abdicateth his> office. In the rest there is no difference from that above written,” (that is,> in the case of a freeman.)—p. 98.[23] “The present form of the jurors’ oath is that they shall ‘give a trueverdict according to the evidence.’ At what time this form was introduced isuncertain; but for several centuries after the Conquest, the jurors, both incivil and criminal cases, were sworn merely to speak the truth. (Glanville, lib.2, cap. 17; Bracton, lib. 3, cap. 22; lib. 4, p. 287, 291; Britton, p. 135.)Hence their decision was accurately termed veredictum, or verdict, that is, ‘athing truly said’; whereas the phrase ‘true verdict’ in the modern oath is notan accurate expression.”—Political Dictionary, word Jury.[24] Of course, there can be no legal trial by jury, in either civil or criminaloases, where the jury are sworn to try the eases “according to law.”[25] Coke, as late as 1588, admits that amercements must be fixed by the peers(8 Coke’s Rep. 38, 2 Inst. 27); but he attempts, wholly without success, as itseems to me, to show a difference between fines and amercements. The statutesare very numerous, running through the three or four hundred years immediatelysucceeding Magna Carta, in which fines, ransoms, and amercements are spoken ofas if they were the common punishments of offences, and as if they all meant thesame thing. If, however, any technical difference could be made out betweenthem, there is clearly none in principle; and the word amercement, as used inMagna Carta, must be taken in its most comprehensive sense.[26] “Common right” was the common law. 1 Coke’s Inst. 142 a. 2 do. 55, 6.[27] The oath of the justices la in these words:“Ye shall swear, that wall and lawfully ye shall serve our lord the king and hispeople, in the office of justice, and that lawfully ye shall counsel the king inhis business, and that ye shall not counsel nor assent to anything which mayturn him in damage or disherison in any manner, way, or color. And that ye shallnot know the damage or disherison of him, whereof ye shall not cause him to bewarned by yourself, or by other; and that ye shall do equal law and execution ofright to all his subjects, rich and poor, without having regard to any person.And that ye take not by yourself, or by other, privily nor apertly, gift norreward of gold nor silver, nor of any other thing that may turn to your profit,unless it be meat or drink, and that of small value, of any man that shall haveany plea or process hanging before you, as long as the same process shall be sohanging, nor after for the same cause. And that ye take no fee, as long as yeshall be justice, nor robe of any man great or small, but of the king himself.And that ye give none advice or counsel to no man great or small, in no casewhere the king is party. And in case that any, of what estate or condition theybe, come before you in your sessions with force and arms, or otherwise againstthe peace, or against the form of the statute thereof made, to disturb executionof the common “law,” (mark the term, “common law,”) or to menace the people thatthey may not pursue the law, that ye shall cause their bodies to be arrested andput in prison; and in case they be such that ye cannot arrest them, that yecertify the king of their names, and of their misprision, hastily, so that hemay thereof ordain a convenable remedy. And that ye by yourself, nor by other,privily nor apertly, maintain any plea or quarrel hanging in the king’s court,or elsewhere in the country. And that ye deny no man common right by the king’sletters, nor none other man’s, nor for none other cause; and in case any letterscome to you contrary to the law,” (that is, the “common law” before mentioned,)“that ye do nothing by such letters, but certify the. king thereof, and proceedto execute the law,” (the “common law” before mentioned,) notwithstanding thesame letters. And that ye shall do and procure the profit of the king and of hiscrown, with all things where ye may reasonably do the same. And in case ye befrom henceforth found in default in any of the points aforesaid, ye shall be atthe king’s will of body, lands, and goods, thereof to be done as shall pleasehim,, as God you help and all saints.”—18 Edward III., st. 4. (1344.)[28] That the terms “Law” and “Right,” as used in this statute, mean the commonlaw, is shown by the preamble, which declares the motive of the statute to bethat * * the Law of the Land, (the common law,) which we (the king) by our oathare bound to maintain,” may be the better kept, &c.[29] The following is a copy of the original:“Forma Juramenti Regis Angliæ in Coronacione sua:(Archiepiscopus Cantuariæ, ad quo de jure et consuetudine Ecclesiæ Cantuariæ,antiqua et approbata, pertinet Reges Angliæ inungere et coronare, diecoronacionis Regis, anteque Rex coronetur, faciet Regi Interrogationessubscriptas.)Si leges et consuetudines ab antiquis justis et Deo devotis Regibus plebiAnglicano concessas, cum sacramenti confirmacione eidem plebi concedere etservare (volueris:) Et præsertim leges et consuetudines et libertates a gloriosoRege Edwardo clero populoque concessas?(Et respondeat Rex,) Concedo et servare volo, et Sacramento confirmare.Servabis Ecclesiæ Dei, Cleroque, et Populo, pacem ex integro et concordiam inDeo secundum vires tuas?(Et respondeat Rex,) Servabo.Facies fieri in omnibus Judiciis tuis equam et rectam justiciam, etdiscrecionem, in misericordia et veritate, secundum vires tuas?

Promulgating his edicts amidst> his peers and prelates, the king uses the language of command; but the> theoretical prerogative was modified by usage, and the practice of the> constitution required that the law should be accepted by the legislatures> (courts) of the several kingdoms. * * The ‘Basileus’ speaks in the tone of> prerogative: Edgar does not merely recommend, he commands that the law shall> be adopted by all the people, whether English, Danes, or Britons, in every> part of his empire. Let this statute be observed, he continues, by Earl Oslac,> and all the host who dwell under his government, and let it be transmitted by> writ to the ealdormen of the other subordinate states. And yet, in defiance of> this positive injunction, the laws of Edgar were not accepted in Mercia until> the reign of Canute the Dane. It might be said that the course so adopted may> have been an exception to the general rule; but in the scanty and imperfect> annals of Anglo-Saxon legislation, we shall be able to find so many examples> of similar proceedings, that this made of enactment must be considered as> dictated by the constitution of the empire.

Their privileges and their> duties were closely conjoined; most frequently, the statutes themselves were> only affirmances of ancient customs, or declaratory enactments. In the> Anglo-Saxon commonwealth, therefore, the legislative functions of the> Witenagemot were of far less importance than the other branches of its> authority. * * The members of the Witenagemot were the ‘Pares Curiæ’ (Peers of> Court) of the kingdom. How far, on these occasions, their opinion or their> equity controlled the power of the crown, cannot be ascertained. But the form> of inserting their names in the ‘Testing Clause’ was retained under the> Anglo-Norman reigns; and the sovereign, who submitted his Charter to the> judgment of the Proceres, professed to be guided by the opinion which they> gave.

The modern oath, in England, viz., that they “willwell and truly try the issue between the parties, and a true verdict give,according to the evidence,” implies the same thing. If the laws of the king hadbeen binding upon a jury, they would have been sworn to try the eases accordingto law, or according to the laws.The ancient writs, in civil suits, as given in Glanville, (within the halfcentury before Magna Carta,) to wit, “Summon twelve free and legal men, (orsometimes twelve knights,) to be in court, prepared upon their oaths to declarewhether A or B have the greater right to the land in question,” indicate thatthe jurors judged of the whole matter on their consciences only.The language of Magna Carta, already discussed, establishes the same point; for,although some of the words, such as “outlawed,” and “exiled,” would apply onlyto criminal cases, nearly the whole chapter applies as well to civil as tocriminal suits. For example, how could the payment of a debt ever be enforcedagainst an unwilling debtor, if he could neither be “arrested, imprisoned, nordeprived of his freehold,” and if the king could neither “proceed against him,nor send any one against him, by force or arms”? Yet Magna Carta as much forbidsthat any of these things shall be done against a debtor, as against a criminal,except according to, or in execution of, “a judgment of his peers, or the law ofthe land,”—a provision which, it has been shown, gave the jury the free andabsolute right to give or withhold “judgment” according to their consciences,irrespective of all legislation.The following provisions, in the Magna Carta of John, illustrate the custom ofreferring the most important matters of a civil nature, even where the king wasa party, to the determination of the peers, or of twelve men, acting by no rulesbut their own consciences. These examples at least show that there is nothingimprobable or unnatural in the idea that juries should try all civil suitsaccording to their own judgments, independently of all laws of the king.Chap. 65. “If we have disseized or dispossessed the Welsh of any lands,liberties, or other things, without the legal judgment of their peers, theyshall be immediately restored to them. And if any dispute arises upon this head,the matter shall be determined in the Marches,[1] by the judgment of theirpeers,” &c.Chap. 68. “We shall treat with Alexander, king of Scots, concerning therestoring of his sisters, and hostages, and rights and liberties, in the sameform and manner as we shall do to the rest of our barons of England; unless bythe engagements, which his father William, late king of Scots, hath entered intowith us, it ought to be otherwise; and this shall be left to the determinationof his peers in our court.”Chap. 56. “All evil customs concerning forests, warrens, and foresters,warreners, sheriffs, and their officers, rivers and their keepers, shallforthwith be inquired into in each county, by twelve knights of the same shire,chosen by the most creditable persons in the same county, and upon oath; andwithin forty days after the said inquest, be utterly abolished, so as never tobe restored.”There is substantially the same reason why a jury ought to judge of the justiceof laws, and hold all unjust laws invalid, in civil suits, as in criminal ones.That reason is the necessity of guarding against the tyranny of the government.Nearly the same oppressions can be practised in civil suits as in criminal ones.For example, individuals may be deprived of their liberty, and robbed of theirproperty, by judgments rendered in civil suits, as well as in criminal ones. Ifthe laws of the king were imperative upon a jury in civil suits, the king mightenact laws giving one man’s property to another, or confiscating it to the kinghimself, and authorizing civil suits to obtain possession of it. Thus a manmight be robbed of his property at the arbitrary pleasure of the king. In fact,all the property of the kingdom would be placed at the arbitrary disposal of theking, through the judgments of juries in civil suits, if the laws of the kingwere imperative upon a jury in such suits.[2]Furthermore, it would be absurd and inconsistent to make a jury paramount tolegislation in criminal suits, and subordinate to it in civil suits; because anindividual, by resisting the execution of a civil judgment, founded upon anunjust law, could give rise to a criminal suit, in which the jury would be boundto hold the same law invalid. So that, if an unjust law were binding upon a juryin civil suits, a defendant, by resisting the execution of the judgment, could,in effect, convert the civil action into a criminal one, in which the jury wouldbe paramount to the same legislation, to which, in the civil suit, they weresubordinate. In other words, in the criminal suit, the jury would be obliged tojustify the defendant in resisting a law, which, in the civil suit, they hadsaid he was bound to submit to.To make this point plain to the most common mind—suppose a law be enacted thatthe property of A shall be given to B. B brings a civil action to obtainpossession of it. If the jury, in this civil suit, are bound to hold the lawobligatory, they render a judgment in favor of B, that he be put in possessionof the property; thereby declaring that A is bound to submit to a law deprivinghim of his property. But when the execution of that judgment comes to beattempted—that is, when the sheriff comes to take the property for the purposeof delivering it to B—A acting, as he has a natural right to do, in defence ofhis property, resists and kills the sheriff. He is thereupon indicted formurder. On this trial his plea is, that in killing the sheriff, he was simplyexercising his natural right of defending his property against an unjust law.The jury, not being bound, in a criminal case, by the authority of an unjustlaw, judge the act on its merits, and acquit the defendant—thus declaring thathe was not bound to submit to the same law which the jury, in the civil suit,had, by their judgment, declared that he was bound to submit to. Here is acontradiction between the two judgments. In the civil suit, the law is declaredto be obligatory upon A; in the criminal suit, the same law is declared to be ofno obligation.It would be a solecism and absurdity in government to allow such consequences asthese. Besides, it would be practically impossible to maintain government onsuch principles; for no government could enforce its civil judgments, unless itcould support them by criminal ones, in case of resistance. A jury musttherefore be paramount to legislation in both civil and criminal cases, or inneither. If they are paramount in neither, they are no protection to liberty. Ifthey are paramount in both, then all legislation goes only for what it maychance to be worth in the estimation of a jury.Another reason why Magna Carta makes the discretion and consciences of juriesparamount to all legislation in civil suits, is, that if legislation werebinding upon a jury, the jurors—(by reason of their being unable to read, asjurors in those days were, and also by reason of many of the statutes beingunwritten, or at least not so many copies written as that juries could besupplied with them)—would have been necessitated—at least in those courts inwhich the king’s justices sat—to take the word of those justices as to what thelaws of the king really were. In other words, they would have been necessitatedto take the law from the court, as jurors do now.Now there were two reasons why, as we may rationally suppose, the people did notwish juries to take their law from the king’s judges. One was, that, at thatday, the people probably had sense enough to see, (what we, at this day, havenot sense enough to see, although we have the evidence of it every day beforeour eyes,) that those judges, being dependent upon the legislative power, (theking,) being appointed by it, paid by it, and removable by it at pleasure, wouldbe mere tools of that power, and would hold all its legislation obligatory,whether it were just or unjust. This was one reason, doubtless, why Magna Cartamade juries, in civil suits, paramount to all instructions of the king’s judges.The reason was precisely the same as that for making them paramount to allinstructions of judges in criminal suits, viz., that the people did not chooseto subject their rights of property, and all other rights involved in civilsuits, to the operation of such laws as the king might please to enact. It wasseen that to allow the king’s judges to dictate the law to the jury would beequivalent to making the legislation of the king imperative upon the jury.Another reason why the people did not wish juries, in civil suits, to take theirlaw from the king’s judges, doubtless was, that, knowing the dependence of thejudges upon the king, and knowing that the king would, of course, tolerate nojudges who were not subservient to his will, they necessarily inferred that theking’s judges would be as corrupt, in the administration of justice, as was theking himself, or as he wished them to be. And how corrupt that was, may beinferred from the following historical facts.Hume says:> “It appears that the ancient kings of England put themselves entirely upon the> footing of the barbarous Eastern princes, whom no man must approach without a> present, who sell all their good offices, and who intrude themselves into> every business that they may have a pretence for extorting money. Even justice> was avowedly bought and sold; the king’s court itself, though the supreme> judicature of the kingdom, was open to none that brought not presents to the> king; the bribes given for expedition, delay, suspension, and doubtless for> the perversion of justice, were entered in the public registers of the royal> revenue, and remain as monuments of the perpetual iniquity and tyranny of the> times. The barons of the exchequer, for instance, the first nobility of the> kingdom, were not ashamed to insert, as an article in their records, that the> county of Norfolk paid a sum that they might be fairly dealt with; the borough> of Yarmouth, that the king’s charters, which they have for their liberties,> might not be violated; Richard, son of Gilbert, for the king’s helping him to> recover his debt from the Jews; * * Serlo, son of Terlavaston, that he might> be permitted to make his defence, in case he were accused of a certain> homicide; Walter de Burton, for free law, if accused of wounding another;> Robert de Essart, for having an inquest to find whether Roger, the butcher,> and Wace and Humphrey, accused him of robbery and theft out of envy and> ill-will, or not; William Buhurst, for having an inquest to find whether he> were accused of the death of one Godwin, out of ill-will, or for just cause. I> have selected these few instances from a great number of the like kind, which> Madox had selected from a still greater number, preserved in the ancient rolls> of the exchequer.> > Sometimes a party litigant offered the king a certain portion, a half, a> third, a fourth, payable out of the debts which he, as the executor of> justice, should assist in recovering. Theophania de Westland agreed to pay the> half of two hundred and twelve marks, that she might recover that sum against> James de Fughleston; Solomon, the Jew, engaged to pay one mark out of every> seven that he should recover against Hugh de la Hose; Nicholas Morrel promised> to pay sixty pounds, that the Earl of Flanders might be distrained to pay him> three hundred and forty-three pounds, which the earl had taken from him; and> these sixty pounds were to be paid out of the first money that Nicholas should> recover from the earl.”—Hume, Appendix 2.> “In the reign of Henry II., the best and most just of these (the Norman)> princes, * * Peter, of Blois, a judicious and even elegant writer, of that> age, gives a pathetic description of the venality of justice, and the> oppressions of the poor, * * and he scruples not to complain to the king> himself of these abuses. We may judge what the case would be under the> government of worse princes.”—Hume, Appendix 2.Carte says:> “The crown exercised in those days an exorbitant and inconvenient power,> ordering the justices of the king’s court, in suits about lands, to turn out,> put, and keep in possession, which of the litigants they pleased; to send> contradictory orders; and take large sums of money from each; to respite> proceedings; to direct sentences; and the judges, acting by their commission,> conceived themselves bound to observe such orders, to the great delay,> interruption, and preventing of justice; at least, this was John’s> practice.”—Carte’s History of England, vol. 1, p. 832.Hallam says:> “But of all the abuses that deformed the Anglo-Saxon government, none was so> flagitious as the sale of judicial redress. The king, we are often told, is> the fountain of justice; but in those ages it was one which gold alone could> unseal. Men fined (paid fines) to have right done them; to sue in a certain> court; to implead a certain person; to have restitution of land which they had> recovered at law. From the sale of that justice which every citizen has a> right to demand, it was an easy transition to withhold or deny it. Fines were> received for the king’s help against the adverse suitor; that is, for> perversion of justice, or for delay. Sometimes they were paid by opposite> parties, and, of course, for opposite ends.”—2 Middle Ages, 438.In allusion to the provision of Magna Carta on this subject, Hallam says:> “A law which enacts that justice shall neither be sold, denied, nor delayed,> stamps with infamy that government under which it had become necessary.”—2> Middle Ages, 451.Lingard, speaking of the times of Henry II., (say 1184,) says:> “It was universally understood that money possessed greater influence than> justice in the royal courts, and instances are on record, in which one party> has made the king a present to accelerate, and the other by a more valuable> offer has succeeded in retarding a decision. * * But besides the fines paid to> the sovereigns, the judges often exacted presents for themselves, and loud> complaints existed against their venality and injustice.”—2 Lingard, 231.In the narrative of “The costs and charges which I, Richard de Anesty, bestowedin recovering the land of William, my uncle,” (some fifty years before MagnaCarta,) are the following items:> “To Ralph, the king’s physician, I gave thirty-six marks and one half; to the> king an hundred marks; and to the queen one mark of gold.” The result is thus> stated. “At last, thanks to our lord the king, and by judgment of his court,> my uncle’s land was adjudged to me.”—2 Palgrave’s Rise and Progress of the> English Commonwealth, p. 9 and 24.Palgrave also says:> “The precious ore was cast into the scales of justice, even when held by the> most conscientious of our Anglo-Saxon kings. A single case will exemplify the> practices which prevailed. Alfric, the heir of ‘Aylwin, the black,’ seeks to> set aside the death-bed bequest, by which his kinsman bestowed four rich and> fertile manors upon St. Benedict. Alfric, the claimant, was supported by> extensive and powerful connexions; and Abbot Alfwine, the defendant, was well> aware that there would be danger in the discussion of the dispute in public,> or before the Folkmoot, (people’s meeting, or county court); or, in other> words, that the Thanes of the shire would do their best to give a judgment in> favor of their compeer. The plea being removed into the Royal Court, the abbot> acted with that prudence which so often calls forth the praises of the> monastic scribe. He gladly emptied twenty marks of gold into the sleeve of the> Confessor, (Edward,) and five marks of gold presented to Edith, the Fair,> encouraged her to aid the bishop, and to exercise her gentle influence in his> favor. Alfric, with equal wisdom, withdrew from prosecuting the hopeless> cause, in which his opponent might possess an advocate in the royal judge, and> a friend in the king’s consort. Both parties, therefore, found it desirable to> come to an agreement.”—1 Palgrave’s Rise and Progress, &c., p. 650.But Magna Carta has another provision for the trial of civil suits, thatobviously had its origin in the corruption of the king’s judges. The provisionis, that four knights, to be chosen in every county, by the people of thecounty, shall sit with the king’s judges, in the Common Pleas, in jury trials,(assizes,) on the trial of three certain kinds of suits, that were among themost important that were tried at all. The reason for this provision undoubtedlywas, that the corruption and subserviency of the king’s judges were so wellknown, that the people would not even trust them to sit alone in a jury trial ofany considerable importance. The provision is this:> Chap. 22, (of John’s Charter.) “Common Pleas shall not follow our court, but> shall be holden in some certain place. Trials upon the writ of novel> disseisin, and of Mort d’Ancester, and of Darrein Presentment, shall be taken> but in their proper counties, and after this manner: We, or, if we should be> out of our realm, our chief justiciary, shall send two justiciaries through> every county four times a year;[3] who, with four knights chosen out of every> shire, by the people, shall hold the assizes (juries) in the county, on the> day and at the place appointed.”It would be very unreasonable to suppose that the king’s judges were allowed todictate the law to the juries, when the people would not even suffer them to sitalone in jury trials, but themselves chose four men to sit with them, to keepthem honest.[4]This practice of sending the king’s judges into the counties to preside at jurytrials, was introduced by the Norman kings. Under the Saxons it was not so. Noofficer of the king was allowed to preside at a jury trial; but only magistrateschosen by the people.[5]But the following chapter of John’s charter, which immediately succeeds the onejust quoted, and refers to the same suits, affords very strong, not to sayconclusive, proof, that juries judged of the law in civil suits—that is, madethe law, so far as their deciding according to their own notions of justicecould make the law.Chap. 23. “And if, on the county day, the aforesaid assizes cannot be taken, somany knights and freeholders shall remain, of those who shall have been presenton said day, as that the judgments may be rendered by them, whether the businessbe more or less.”The meaning of this chapter is, that so many of the civil suits, as could not betried on the day when the king’s justices were present, should be triedafterwards, by the four knights before mentioned, and the freeholders, that is,the jury. It must be admitted, of course, that the juries, in these cases,judged the matters of law, as well as fact, unless it be presumed that theknights dictated the law to the jury—a thing of which there is no evidence atall.As a final proof on this point, there is a statute enacted seventy years afterMagna Carta, which, although it is contrary to the common law, and thereforevoid, is nevertheless good evidence, inasmuch as it contains an acknowledgment,on the part of the king himself, that juries had a right to judge of the wholematter, law and fact, in civil suits. The provision is this:> “It is ordained, that the justices assigned to take the assizes, shall not> compel the jurors to say precisely whether it be disseisin, or not, so that> they do show the truth of the deed, and seek aid of the justices. But if they> will, of their own accord, say that it is disseisin, or not, their verdict> shall be admitted at their own peril.”—13 Edward I., st. 1, ch. 3, sec. 2.> (1285.)The question of “disseisin, or not,” was a question of law, as well as fact.This statute, therefore, admits that the law, as well as the fact, was in thehands of the jury. The statute is nevertheless void, because the king had noauthority to give jurors a dispensation from the obligation imposed upon them bytheir oaths and the “law of the land,” that they should “make known the truthaccording their (own) consciences.” This they were bound to do, and there was nopower in the. king to absolve them from the duty. And the attempt of the kingthus to absolve them, and authorize them to throw the case into the hands of thejudges for decision, was simply an illegal and unconstitutional attempt tooverturn the “law of the land,” which he was sworn to maintain, and gather powerinto his own hands, through his judges. He had just as much constitutional powerto enact that the jurors should not be compelled to declare the facts, but thatthey might leave them to be determined by the king’s judges, as he had to enactthat they should not be compelled to declare the law, but might leave it to bedecided by the king’s judges. It was as much the legal duty of the jury todecide the law as to decide the fact; and no law of the king could affect theirobligation to do either. And this statute is only one example of the numberlesscontrivances and usurpations which have been resorted to, for the purpose ofdestroying the original and genuine trial by jury.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] Marches, the limits, or boundaries, between England and Wales.[2] That the kings would have had no scruples to enact laws for the specialpurpose of plundering the people,, by means of the judgments of juries, if theycould have got juries to acknowledge the authority of their laws, is evidentfrom the audacity with which they plundered them, without any judgments ofjuries to authorize them.It is not necessary to occupy space here to give details as to these robberies;but only some evidence of the general fact.Hallam says, that “For the first three reigns (of the Norman kings) * * theintolerable exactions of tribute, the rapine of purveyance, the iniquity ofroyal courts, are continually in the mouths of the historians. ‘God sees thewretched people,’ says the Saxon Chronicler, ‘most unjustly oppressed; firstthey are despoiled of their possessions, and then butchered.’ This was agrievous year (1124). Whoever had any property, lost it by heavy taxes andunjust decrees.”—2 Middle Ages, 435–6.> “In the succeeding reign of John, all the rapacious exactions usual to these> Norman kings were not only redoubled, but mingled with outrages of tyranny> still more intolerable. * *> > “In 1207 John took a seventh of the movables of lay and spiritual persons, all> murmuring, but none daring to speak against it.”—Ditto, 446.In Hume’s account of the extortions of those times, the following paragraphoccurs:> “But the most barefaced acts of tyranny and oppression were practised against> the Jews, who were entirely out of the protection of the law, and were> abandoned to the immeasurable rapacity of the king and his ministers. Besides> many other indignities, to which they were continually exposed, it appears> that they were once all thrown into prison, and the sum of 60,000 marks> exacted for their liberty. At another time, Isaac, the Jew, paid alone 5100> marks; Brun, 3000 marks; Jurnet, 2000; Bennet, 500. At another, Licorica,> widow of David, the Jew of Oxford, was required to pay 6000 marks.”—Hume’s> Hist. Eng., Appendix 2.Further accounts of the extortions and oppressions of the kings may be found inHume’s History, Appendix 2, and in Hallam’s Middle Ages, vol. 2, p. 435 to 446.> By Magna Carta John bound himself to make restitution for some of the> spoliations lie had committed upon individuals “without the legal judgment of> their peers.”—See Magna Carta of John, ch. 60, 61, 65 and 66.One of the great charges, on account of which the nation rose against John, was,that he plundered individuals of their property, “without legal judgment oftheir peers.” Now it was evidently very weak and short-sighted in John to exposehimself to such charges, if his laws were really obligatory upon the peers;because, in that case, he could have enacted any laws that were necessary forhas purpose, and then, by civil suits, .have brought the cases before juries fortheir “judgment,” and thus have accomplished all his robberies in a perfectlylegal manner.There would evidently have been no sense in these complaints, that he deprivedmen of their property “without legal judgment of their peers,” if his laws hadbeen binding upon the peers; because he could then have made the samespoliations as well with the judgment of the peers as without it. Taking thejudgment of the peers in the matter, would have been only a ridiculous anduseless formality, if they were to exercise no discretion or conscience of theirown, independently of the laws of the king.It may here be mentioned, in passing, that the same would be true in criminalmatters, if the king’s laws were obligatory upon juries.As an illustration of what tyranny the kings would sometimes practise, Humesays:> “It appears from the Great Charter itself, that not only John, a tyrannical> prince, and Richard, a violent one, but their father Henry, under whose reign> the prevalence of gross abuses is the least to be suspected, were accustomed,> from their sole authority, without process of law, to imprison, banish, and> attaint the freemen of their kingdom.”—Hume, Appendix 2.The provision, also, in the 64th chapter of Magna Carta, that “all unjust andillegal fines, and all amercements, imposed unjustly, and contrary to the Law ofthe Land, shall be entirely forgiven,” &c.; and the provision, in chapter 61,that the king “will cause full justice to be administered” in regard to “allthose things, of which any person has, without legal judgment of his peers, beendispossessed or deprived, either by King Henry, our father, or our brother, KingRichard,” indicate the tyrannical practices that prevailed.> We are told also that John himself “had dispossessed several great men without> any judgment of their peers, condemned others to cruel deaths, * * insomuch> that his tyrannical will stood instead of a law.”—Echard’s History of England,> 106.Now all these things were very unnecessary and foolish, if his laws were bindingupon juries; because, in that case, be could have procured the conviction ofthese men in a legal manner, and thus have saved the necessity of suchusurpation. In short, if the laws of the king had been binding upon juries,there is no robbery, vengeance, or oppression, which he could not haveaccomplished through the judgments of juries. This consideration is sufficient,of itself, to prove that the laws of the king were of no authority over a jury,in either civil or criminal oases, unless the juries regarded the laws as justin themselves.[3] By the Magna Carta of Henry III. this is changed to once a year,[4] From the provision of Magna Carta, cited in the text, it must be inferredthat there can be no legal trial by jury, in civil cases, if only the king’sjustices preside; that, to make the trial legal, there must be other persons,chosen by the people, to sit with them; the object being to prevent the jury’sbeing deceived by the justices. I think we must also infer that the king’sjustices could sit only in the three actions specially mentioned. We cannot gobeyond the letter of Magna Carta, in making innovations upon the common law,which required all presiding officers in jury trials to be elected by thepeople.[5] “The earls, sheriffs, and head-boroughs were annually elected in the fullfolcmote, (people’s meeting).”—Introduction to Gilbert’s History of the CommonPleas, p. 2, note.“It was the especial province of the earldomen or earl to attend theshyre-meeting, (the county court,) twice a year, and there officiate as thecounty judge in expounding the secular laws, as appears by the fifth of Edgar’slaws.”—Same, p. 2, note.“Every ward had its proper alderman, who was chosen, and not imposed by theprince.”—Same, p. 4, text.“As the aldermen, or earls, were always chosen” (by the people) “from among thegreatest thanes, who in those times were generally more addicted to arms than toletters, they were but ill-qualified for the administration of justice, andperforming the civil duties of their office.”—3 Henry’s History of GreatBritain, 343.“But none of these thanes were annually elected in the full folomote, (people’smeeting,) as the earls, sheriffs, and head-boroughs were; nor did King Alfred(as this author suggests) deprive the people of the election of those lastmentioned magistrates and nobles, much less did he appoint themhimself.”—Introd. to Gilbert’s Hist. Com. Pleas, p. 2, note.“The sheriff was usually not appointed by the lord, but elected by thefreeholders of the district.”—Political Dictionary, word Sheriff.“Among the most remarkable of the Saxon laws we may reckon * * the election oftheir magistrates by the people, originally even that of their kings, tilldear-bought experience evinced the convenience and necessity of establishing anhereditary succession to the crown. But that (the election) of all subordinatemagistrates, their military officers or heretochs, their sheriffs, theirconservators of the peace, their coroners, their portreeves, (since changed intomayors and bailiffs,) and even their tithing-men and borsholders at the last,continued, some, till the Norman conquest, others for two centuries after, andsome remain to this day.”—4 Blackstone, 413.“The election of sheriffs was left to the people, according to ancientusage.”—St. West. 1, c. 27.—Crabbe’s History of English Law, 181."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER V.OBJECTIONS ANSWERE.The following objections will be made to the doctrines and the evidencepresented in the preceding chapters.1. That it is a maxim of the law, that the judges respond to the question oflaw, and juries only to the question of fact.The answer to this objection is, that, since Magna Carta, judges have had morethan six centuries in which to invent and promulgate pretended maxims to suitthemselves; and this is one of them. Instead of expressing the law, it expressesnothing but the ambitious and lawless will of the judges themselves, and ofthose whose instruments they are.[1]2. It will be asked, Of what use are the justices, if the jurors judge both oflaw and fact?The answer is, that they are of use, 1. To assist and enlighten the jurors, ifthey can, by their advice and information; such advice and information to bereceived only for what they may chance to be worth in the estimation of thejurors. 2. To do anything that may be necessary in regard to granting appealsand new trials.3. It is said that it would be absurd that twelve ignorant men should have powerto judge of the law, while justices learned in the law should be compelled tosit by and see the law decided erroneously.One answer to this objection is, that the powers of juries are not granted tothem on the supposition that they know the law better than the justices; but onthe ground that the justices are untrustworthy, that they are exposed to bribes,are themselves fond of power and authority, and are also the dependent andsubservient creatures of the legislature; and that to allow them to dictate thelaw, would not only expose the rights of parties to be sold for money, but wouldbe equivalent to surrendering all the property, liberty, and rights of thepeople, unreservedly into the hands of arbitrary power, (the legislature,) to bedisposed of at its pleasure. The powers of juries, therefore, not only place acurb upon the powers of legislators and judges, but imply also an imputationupon their integrity and trustworthiness; and these are the reasons whylegislators and judges have formerly entertained the intensest hatred of juries,and, so fast as they could do it without alarming the people for theirliberties, have, by indirection, denied, undermined, and practically destroyedtheir power. And it is only since all the real power of juries has beendestroyed, and they have become mere tools in the hands of legislators andjudges, that they have become favorites with them.Legislators and judges are necessarily exposed to all the temptations of money,fame, and power, to induce them to disregard justice between parties, and sellthe rights, and violate the liberties of the people. Jurors, on the other hand,are exposed to none of these temptations. They are not liable to bribery, forthey are unknown to the parties until they come into the jury-box. They canrarely gain either fame, power, or money, by giving erroneous decisions. Theiroffices are temporary, and they know that when they shall have executed them,they must return to the people, to hold all their own rights in life subject tothe liability of such judgments, by their successors, as they themselves havegiven an example for. The laws of human nature do not permit the suppositionthat twelve men, taken by lot from the mass of the people, and acting under suchcircumstances, will all prove dishonest. It is a supposable case that they maynot be sufficiently enlightened to know and do their whole duty, in all caseswhatsoever; but that they should all prove dishonest, is not within the range ofprobability. A jury, therefore, insures to us—what no other court does—thatfirst and indispensable requisite in a judicial tribunal, integrity.4. It is alleged that if juries are allowed to judge of the law, they decide thelaw absolutely; that their decision must necessarily stand, be it right orwrong; and that this power of absolute decision would be dangerous in theirhands, by reason of their ignorance of the law.One answer is, that this power, which juries have of judging of the law, is nota power of absolute decision in all cases. For example, it is a power to declareimperatively that a man’s property, liberty, or life, shall not be taken fromhim; but it is not a power to declare imperatively that they shall be taken fromhim.Magna Carta does not provide that the judgments of the peers shall be executed;but only that no other than their judgments shall ever be executed, so far as totake a party’s goods, rights, or person, thereon.A judgment of the peers may be reviewed, and invalidated, and a new trialgranted. So that practically a jury has no absolute power to take a party’sgoods, rights, or person. They have only an absolute veto upon their being takenby the government. The government is not bound to do everything that a jury mayadjudge. It is only prohibited from doing anything—(that is, from taking aparty’s goods, rights, or person)—unless a jury have first adjudged it to bedone.But it will, perhaps, be said, that if an erroneous judgment of one jury shouldbe reaffirmed by another, on a new trial, it must then be executed. But MagnaCarta does not command even this—although it might, perhaps, have beenreasonably safe for it to have done so—for if two juries unanimously affirm thesame thing, after all the light and aid that judges and lawyers can afford them,that fact probably furnishes as strong a presumption in favor of the correctnessof their opinion, as can ordinarily be obtained in favor of a judgment, by anymeasures of a practical character for the administration of justice. Still,there is nothing in Magna Carta that compels the execution of even a secondjudgment of a jury. The only injunction of Magna Carta upon the government, asto what it shall do, on this point, is that it shall “do justice and right,”without sale, denial, or delay. But this leaves the government all power ofdetermining what is justice and right, except that it shall not consideranything as justice and right—so far as to carry it into execution against thegoods, rights, or person of a party—unless it be something which a jury havesanctioned.If the government had no alternative but to execute all judgments of a juryindiscriminately, the power of juries would unquestionably be dangerous; forthere is no doubt that they may sometimes give hasty and erroneous judgments.But when it is considered that their judgments can be reviewed, and new trialsgranted, this danger is, for all practical purposes, obviated.If it be said that juries may successively give erroneous judgments, and thatnew trials cannot be granted indefinitely, the answer is, that so far as MagnaCarta is concerned, there is nothing to prevent the granting of new trialsindefinitely, if the judgments of juries are contrary to “justice and right.” Sothat Magna Carta does not require any judgment whatever to be executed—so far asto take a party’s goods, rights, or person, thereon—unless it be concurred in byboth court and jury.Nevertheless, we may, for the sake of the argument, suppose the existence of apractical, if not legal, necessity, for executing some judgment or other, incases where juries persist in disagreeing with the courts. In such cases, theprinciple of Magna Carta unquestionably is, that the uniform judgments ofsuccessive juries shall prevail over the opinion of the court. And the reason ofthis principle is obvious, viz., that it is the will of the country, and not thewill of the court, or the government, that must determine what laws shall beestablished and enforced; that the concurrent judgments of successive juries,given in opposition to all the reasoning which judges and lawyers can offer tothe contrary, must necessarily be presumed to be a truer exposition of the willof the country, than are the opinions of the judges.But it may be said that, unless jurors submit to the control of the court, inmatters of law, they may disagree among themselves, and never come to anyjudgment; and thus justice fail to be done.Such a case is perhaps possible; but, if possible, it can occur but rarely;because, although one jury may disagree, a succession of juries are not likelyto disagree—that is, on matters of natural law, or abstract justice.[2] If sucha thing should occur, it would almost certainly be owing to the attempt of thecourt to mislead them. It is hardly possible that any other cause should beadequate to produce such an effect; because justice comes very near to being aself-evident principle. The mind perceives it almost intuitively. If, inaddition to this, the court be uniformly on the side of justice, it is not areasonable supposition that a succession of juries should disagree about it. If,therefore, a succession of juries do disagree on the law of any case, thepresumption is, not that justice fails of being done, but that injustice isprevented—that injustice, which would be done, if the opinion of the court weresuffered to control the jury.For the sake of the argument, however, it may be admitted to be possible thatjustice should sometimes fail of being done through the disagreements of jurors,notwithstanding all the light which judges and lawyers can throw upon thequestion in issue. If it be asked what provision the trial by jury makes forsuch cases, the answer is, it makes none; and justice must fail of being done,from the want of its being made sufficiently intelligible.Under the trial by jury, justice can never be done—that is, by a judgment thatshall take a party’s goods, rights, or person—until that justice can be madeintelligible or perceptible to the minds of all the jurors; or, at least, untilit obtain the voluntary assent of all—an assent, which ought not to be givenuntil the justice itself shall have become perceptible to all.The principles of the trial by jury, then, are these:1. That, in criminal cases, the accused is presumed innocent.2. That, in civil cases, possession is presumptive proof of property; or, inother words, every man is presumed to be the rightful proprietor of whatever hehas in his possession.3. That these presumptions shall be overcome, in a court of justice, only byevidence, the sufficiency of which, and by law, the justice of which, aresatisfactory to the understanding and consciences of all the jurors.These are the bases on which the trial by jury places the property, liberty, andrights of every individual.But some one will say, if these are the principles of the trial by jury, then itis plain that justice must often fail to be done. Admitting, for the sake of theargument, that this may be true, the compensation for it is, that positiveinjustice will also often fail to be done; whereas otherwise it would be donefrequently. The very precautions used to prevent injustice being done, may oftenhave the effect to prevent justice being done. But are we, therefore, to take noprecautions against injustice? By no means, all will agree. The question thenarises—Does the trial by jury, as here explained, involve such extreme andunnecessary precautions against injustice, as to interpose unnecessary obstaclesto the doing of justice? Men of different minds may very likely answer thisquestion differently, according as they have more or less confidence in thewisdom and justice of legislators, the integrity and independence of judges, andthe intelligence of jurors. This much, however, may be said in favor of theseprecautions, viz., that the history of the past, as well as our constant presentexperience, prove how much injustice may, and certainly will, be done,systematically and continually, for the want of these precautions—that is, whilethe law is authoritatively made and expounded by legislators and judges. On theother hand, we have no such evidence of how much justice may fail to be done, byreason of these precautions—that is, by reason of the law being left to thejudgments and consciences of jurors. We can determine the former point—that is,how much positive injustice is done under the first of these two systems—becausethe system is in full operation; but we cannot determine how much justice wouldfail to be done under the latter system, because we have, in modern times, hadno experience of the use of the precautions themselves. In ancient times, whenthese precautions were nominally in force, such was the tyranny of kings, andsuch the poverty, ignorance, and the inability of concert and resistance, on thepart of the people, that the system had no full or fair operation. It,nevertheless, under all these disadvantages, impressed itself upon theunderstandings, and imbedded itself in the hearts, of the people, so as no othersystem of civil liberty has ever done.But this view of the two systems compares only the injustice done, and thejustice omitted to be done, in the individual cases adjudged, without lookingbeyond them. And some persons might, on first thought, argue that, if justicefailed of being done under the one system, oftener than positive injustice weredone under the other, the balance was in favor of the latter system. But such aweighing of the two systems against each other gives no true idea of theircomparative merits or demerits; for, possibly, in this view alone, the balancewould not be very great in favor of either. To compare, or rather to contrast,the two, we must consider that, under the jury system, the failures to dojustice would be only rare and exceptional cases; and would be owing either tothe intrinsic difficulty of the questions, or to the fact that the parties hadtransacted their business in a manner unintelligible to the jury, and theeffects would be confined to the individual or individuals interested in theparticular suits. No permanent law would be established thereby destructive ofthe rights of the people in other like cases. And the people at large wouldcontinue to enjoy all their natural rights as before. But under the othersystem, whenever an unjust law is enacted by the legislature, and the judgeimposes it upon the jury as authoritative, and they give a judgment inaccordance therewith, the authority of the law is thereby established, and thewhole people are thus brought under the yoke of that law; because they thenunderstand that the law will be enforced against them in future, if they presumeto exercise their rights, or refuse to comply with the exactions of the law. Inthis manner all unjust laws are established, and made operative against therights of the people.The difference, then, between the two systems is this: Under the one system, ajury, at distant intervals, would (not enforce any positive injustice, but only)fail of enforcing justice, in a dark and difficult case, or in consequence ofthe parties not having transacted their business in a manner intelligible to ajury; and the plaintiff would thus fail of obtaining what was rightfully duehim. And there the matter would end, for evil, though not for good; forthenceforth parties, warned of the danger of losing their rights, would becareful to transact their business in a more clear and intelligible manner.Under the other system—the system of legislative and judicial authority—positiveinjustice is not only done in every suit arising under unjust laws,—that is,men’s property, liberty, or lives are not only unjustly taken on thoseparticular judgments,—but the rights of the whole people are struck down by theauthority of the laws thus enforced, and a wide-sweeping tyranny at once put inoperation.But there is another ample and conclusive answer to the argument that justicewould often fail to be done, if jurors were allowed to be governed by their ownconsciences, instead of the direction of the justices, in matters of law. Thatanswer is this:Legitimate government can be formed only by the voluntary association of all whocontribute to its support. As a voluntary association, it can have for itsobjects only those things in which the members of the association are allagreed. If, therefore, there be any justice, in regard to which all the partiesto the government are not agreed, the objects of the association do not extendto it.[3]If any of the members wish more than this,—if they claim to have acquired a moreextended knowledge of justice than is common to all, and wish to have theirpretended discoveries carried into effect, in reference to themselves,—they musteither form a separate association for that purpose, or be content to wait untilthey can make their views intelligible to the people at large. They cannot claimor expect that the whole people shall practise the folly of taking on trusttheir pretended superior knowledge, and of committing blindly into their handsall their own interests, liberties, and rights, to be disposed of on principles,the justness of which the people themselves cannot comprehend.A government of the whole, therefore, must necessarily confine itself to theadministration of such principles of law as all the people, who contribute tothe support of the government, can comprehend and see the justice of. And it canbe confined within those limits only by allowing the jurors, who represent allthe parties to the compact, to judge of the law, and the justice of the law, inall cases whatsoever. And if any justice be left undone, under thesecircumstances, it is a justice for which the nature of the association does notprovide, which the association does not undertake to do, and which, as anassociation, it is under no obligation to do.The people at large, the unlearned and common people, have certainly anindisputable right to associate for the establishment and maintenance of such agovernment as they themselves see the justice of, and feel the need of, for thepromotion of their own interests, and the safety of their own rights, without atthe same time surrendering all their property, liberty, and rights into thehands of men, who, under the pretence of a superior and incomprehensibleknowledge of justice, may dispose of such property, liberties, and rights, in amanner to suit their own selfish and dishonest purposes.If a government were to be established and supported solely by that portion ofthe people who lay claim to superior knowledge, there would be some consistencyin their saying that the common people should not be received as jurors, withpower to judge of the justice of the laws. But so long as the whole people (orall the male adults) are presumed to be voluntary parties to the government, andvoluntary contributors to its support, there is no consistency in refusing toany one of them more than to another the right to sit as juror, with full powerto decide for himself whether any law that is proposed to be enforced in anyparticular case, be within the objects of the association.The conclusion, therefore, is, that, in a government formed by voluntaryassociation, or on the theory of voluntary association, and voluntary support,(as all the North American governments are,) no law can rightfully be enforcedby the association in its corporate capacity, against the goods, rights, orperson of any individual, except it be such as all the members of theassociation agree that it may enforce. To enforce any other law, to the extentof taking a man’s goods, rights, or person, would be making some of the partiesto the association accomplices in what they regard as acts of injustice. Itwould also be making them consent to what they regard as the destruction oftheir own rights. These are things which no legitimate system or theory ofgovernment can require of any of the parties to it.The mode adopted, by the trial by jury, for ascertaining whether all the partiesto the government do approve of a particular law, is to take twelve men atrandom from the whole people, and accept their unanimous decision asrepresenting the opinions of the whole. Even this mode is not theoreticallyaccurate; for theoretical accuracy would require that every man, who was a partyto the government, should individually give his consent to the enforcement ofevery law in every separate case. But such a thing would be impossible inpractice. The consent of twelve men is therefore taken instead; with theprivilege of appeal, and (in case of error found by the the appeal court) a newtrial, to guard against possible mistakes. This system, it is assumed, willascertain the sense of the whole people—“the country”—with sufficient accuracyfor all practical purposes, and with as much accuracy as is practicable withouttoo great inconvenience and expense.5. Another objection that will perhaps be made to allowing jurors to judge ofthe law, and the justice of the law, is, that the law would be uncertain.If, by this objection, it be meant that the law would be uncertain to the mindsof the people at large, so that they would not know what the juries wouldsanction and what condemn, and would not therefore know practically what theirown rights and liberties were under the law, the objection is thoroughlybaseless and false. No system of law that was ever devised could be so entirelyintelligible and certain to the minds of the people at large as this. Comparedwith it, the complicated systems of law that are compounded of the law ofnature, of constitutional grants, of innumerable and incessantly changinglegislative enactments, and of countless and contradictory judicial decisions,with no uniform principle of reason or justice running through them, are amongthe blindest of all the mazes in which unsophisticated minds were everbewildered and lost. The uncertainty of the law under these systems has become aproverb. So great is this uncertainty, that nearly all men, learned as well asunlearned, shun the law as their enemy, instead of resorting to it forprotection. They usually go into courts of justice, so called, only as men gointo battle—when there is no alternative left for them. And even then they gointo them as men go into dark labyrinths and caverns—with no knowledge of theirown, but trusting wholly to their guides. Yet, less fortunate than otheradventurers, they can have little confidence even in their guides, for thereason that the guides themselves know little of the mazes they are threading.They know the mode and place of entrance; but what they will meet with on theirway, and what will be the time, mode, place, or condition of their exit; whetherthey will emerge into a prison, or not; whether wholly naked and destitute, ornot; whether with their reputations left to them, or not; and whether in time oreternity; experienced and honest guides rarely venture to predict. Was thereever such fatuity as that of a nation of men madly bent on building up suchlabyrinths as these, for no other purpose than that of exposing all their rightsof reputation, property, liberty, and life, to the hazards of being lost inthem, instead of being content to live in the light of the open day of their ownunderstandings?What honest, unsophisticated man ever found himself involved in a lawsuit, thathe did not desire, of all things, that his cause might be judged of onprinciples of natural justice, as those principles were understood by plain menlike himself? He would then feel that he could foresee the result. These plainmen are the men who pay the taxes, and support the government. Why should theynot have such an administration of justice as they desire, and can understand?If the jurors were to judge of the law, and the justice of the law, there wouldbe something like certainty in the administration of justice, and in the popularknowledge of the law, and men would govern themselves accordingly. There wouldbe something like certainty, because every man has himself something likedefinite and clear opinions, and also knows something of the opinions of hisneighbors, on matters of justice. And he would know that no statute, unless itwere so clearly just as to command the unanimous assent of twelve men, whoshould be taken at random from the whole community, could be enforced so as totake from him his reputation, property, liberty, or life. What greater certaintycan men require or need, as to the laws under which they are to live? If astatute were enacted by a legislature, a man, in order to know what was its trueinterpretation, whether it were constitutional, and whether it would beenforced, would not be tinder the necessity of waiting for years until some suithad arisen and been carried through all the stages of judicial proceeding, to afinal decision. He would need only to use his own reason as to its meaning andits justice, and then talk with his neighbors on the same points. Unless hefound them nearly unanimous in their interpretation and approbation of it, hewould conclude that juries would not unite in enforcing it, and that it wouldconsequently be a dead letter. And he would be safe in coming to thisconclusion.There would be something like certainty in the administration of justice, and inthe popular knowledge of the law, for the further reason that there would belittle legislation, and men’s rights would be left to stand almost solely uponthe law of nature, or what was once called in England “the common law,” (beforeso much legislation and usurpation had become incorporated info the commonlaw,)—in other words, upon the principles of natural justice.Of the certainty of this law of nature, or the ancient English common law, I maybe excused for repeating here what I have said on another occasion.“Natural law, so far from being uncertain, when compared with statutory andconstitutional law, is the only thing that gives any certainty at all to a verylarge portion of our statutory and constitutional law. The reason is this. Thewords in which statutes and constitutions are written are susceptible of so manydifferent meanings,—meanings widely different from, often directly opposite to,each other, in their bearing upon men’s rights,—that, unless there were somerule of interpretation for determining which of these various and oppositemeanings are the true ones, there could be no certainty at all as to the meaningof the statutes and constitutions themselves. Judges could make almost anythingthey should please out of them. Hence the necessity of a rule of interpretation.And this ride is, that the language of statutes and constitutions shall beconstrued, as nearly as possible, consistently with natural law.The rule assumes, what is true, that natural law is a thing certain in itself;also that it is capable of being learned. It assumes, furthermore, that itactually is understood by the legislators and judges who make and interpret thewritten law. Of necessity, therefore, it assumes further, that they (thelegislators and judges) are incompetent to make and interpret the written law,unless they previously understand the natural law applicable to the samesubject. It also assumes that the people must understand the natural law, beforethey can understand the written law.It is a principle perfectly familiar to lawyers, and one that must be perfectlyobvious to every other man that will reflect a moment, that, as a general rule,no one can know what the written law is, until he knows what it ought to be;that men are liable to be constantly misled by the various and conflictingsenses of the same words, unless they perceive the true legal sense in which thewords ought to be taken. And this true legal sense is the sense that is mostnearly consistent with natural law of any that the words can be made to bear,consistently with the laws of language, and appropriately to the subjects towhich they are applied.Though the words contain the law, the words themselves are not the law. Were thewords themselves the law, each single Written law would be liable to embracemany different laws, to wit, as many different laws as there were differentsenses, and different combinations of senses, in which each and all the WordsWere capable of being taken.Take, for example, the Constitution of the United States. By adopting one oranother sense of the single word “free,” the whole instrument is changed. Yetthe word free is capable of some ten or twenty different senses. So that, bychanging the sense of that single word, some ten or twenty differentconstitutions could be made out of the same written instrument. But there are,we will suppose, a thousand other words in the constitution, each of which iscapable of from two to ten different senses. So that, by changing the sense ofonly a single word at a time, several thousands of different constitutions wouldbe made. But this is not all. Variations could also be made by changing thesenses of two or more words at a time, and these variations could be run throughall the changes and combinations of senses that these thousand words are capableof. We see, then, that it is no more than a literal truth, that out of thatsingle instrument, as it now stands, without altering the location of a singleword, might be formed, by construction and interpretation, more differentconstitutions than figures can well estimate.But each written law, in order to be a law, must be taken only in some onedefinite and distinct sense; and that definite and distinct sense must beselected from the almost infinite variety of senses which its words are capableof. How is this selection to be made? It can be only by the aid of thatperception of natural law, or natural justice, which men naturally possess.Such, then, is the comparative certainty of the natural and the written law.Nearly all the certainty there is in the latter, so far as it relates toprinciples, is based upon, and derived from, the still greater certainty of theformer. In fact, nearly all the uncertainty of the laws under which welive,—which are a mixture of natural and written laws,—arises from thedifficulty of construing, or, rather, from the facility of misconstruing, thewritten law; while natural law has nearly or quite the same certainty asmathematics On this point, Sir William Jones, one of the most learned judgesthat have ever lived, learned in Asiatic as well as European law, says,—and thefact should be kept forever in mind, as one of the most important of alltruths:—“It is pleasing to remark the similarity, or, rather, the identity ofthose conclusions which pure, unbiassed reason, in all ages and nations, seldomfails to draw, in such juridical inquiries as are not fettered and manacled bypositive institutions.”[4] In short, the simple fact that the written law mustbe interpreted by the natural, is, of itself, a sufficient confession of thesuperior certainty of the latter.The written law, then, even where it can be construed consistently with thenatural, introduces labor and obscurity, instead of shutting them out. And thismust always be the case, because words do not create ideas, but only recallthem; and the same word may recall many different ideas. For this reason, nearlyall abstract principles can be seen by the single mind more clearly than theycan be expressed by words to another. This is owing to the imperfection oflanguage, and the different senses, meanings, and shades of meaning, whichdifferent individuals attach to the same words, in the same circumstances.[5]Where the written law cannot be construed consistently with the natural, thereis no reason why it should ever be enacted at all. It may, indeed, besufficiently plain and certain to be easily understood; but its certainty andplainness are but a poor compensation for its injustice. Doubtless a lawforbidding men to drink water, on pain of death, might be made so intelligibleas to cut off all discussion as to its meaning; but would the intelligiblenessof such a law be any equivalent for the right to drink water? The principle isthe same in regard to all unjust laws. Few persons could reasonably feelcompensated for the arbitrary destruction of their rights, by having the orderfor their destruction made known beforehand, in terms so distinct andunequivocal as to admit of neither mistake nor evasion. Yet this is all thecompensation that such laws offer.Whether, therefore, written laws correspond with, or differ from, the natural,they are to be condemned. In the first case, they are useless repetitions,introducing labor and obscurity. In the latter case, they are positiveviolations of men’s rights.There would be substantially the same reason in enacting mathematics by statute,that there is in enacting natural law. Whenever the natural law is sufficientlycertain to all men’s minds to justify its being enacted, it is sufficientlycertain to need no enactment. On the other hand, until it be thus certain, thereis danger of doing injustice by enacting it; it should, therefore, be left opento be discussed by anybody who may be disposed to question it, and to be judgedof by the proper tribunal, the judiciary.[6]It is not necessary that legislators should enact natural law in order that itmay be known to the people, because that would be presuming that the legislatorsalready understand it better than the people,—a fact of which I am not awarethat they have ever heretofore given any very satisfactory evidence. The samesources of knowledge on the subject are open to the people that are open to thelegislators, and the people must be presumed to know it as well as they.The objections made to natural law, on the ground of obscurity, are whollyunfounded. It is true, it must be learned, like any other science; but it isequally true that it is very easily learned. Although as illimitable in itsapplications as the infinite relations of men to each other, it is,nevertheless, made up of simple elementary principles, of the truth and justiceof which every ordinary mind has an almost intuitive perception. It is thescience of justice,—and almost all men have the same perceptions of whatconstitutes justice, or of what justice requires, when they understand alike thefacts from which their inferences are to be drawn. Men living in contact witheach other, and having intercourse together, cannot avoid learning natural law,to a very great extent, even if they would. The dealings of men with men, theirseparate possessions, and their individual wants, are continually forcing upontheir minds the questions,—Is this act just? or is it unjust? Is this thingmine? or is it his? And these are questions of natural law; questions, which, inregard to the great mass of cases, are answered alike by the human mindeverywhere.Children learn many principles of natural law at a very early age. For example:they learn that when one child has picked up an apple or a flower, it is his,and that his associates must not take it from him against his will. They alsolearn that if he voluntarily exchange his apple or flower with a playmate, forsome other article of desire, he has thereby surrendered his right to it, andmust not reclaim it. These are fundamental principles of natural law, whichgovern most of the greatest interests of individuals and society; yet childrenlearn them earlier than they learn that three and three are six, or five andfive, ten. Talk of enacting natural law by statute, that it may be known! Itwould hardly be extravagant to say, that, in nine cases in ten, men learn itbefore they have learned the language by which we describe it. Nevertheless,numerous treatises are written on it, as on other sciences. The decisions ofcourts, containing their opinions upon the almost endless variety of cases thathave come before them, are reported; and these reports are condensed, codified,and digested, so as to give, in a small compass, the facts, and the opinions ofthe courts as to the law resulting from them. And these treatises, codes, anddigests are open to be read of all men. And a man has the same excuse for beingignorant of arithmetic, or any other science, that he has for being ignorant ofnatural law. He can learn it as well, if he will, without its being enacted, ashe could if it were.If our governments would but themselves adhere to natural law, there would belittle occasion to complain of the ignorance of the people in regard to it. Thepopular ignorance of law is attributable mainly to the innovations that havebeen made upon natural law by legislation; whereby our system has become anincongruous mixture of natural and statute law, with no uniform principlepervading it. To learn such a system,—if system it can be called, and if learnedit can be,—is a matter of very similar difficulty to what it would be to learn asystem of mathematics, which should consist of the mathematics of nature,interspersed with such other mathematics as might be created by legislation, inviolation of all the natural principles of numbers and quantities.But whether the difficulties of learning natural law be greater or less thanhere represented, they exist in the nature of things, and cannot be removed.Legislation, instead of removing, only increases them. This it does byinnovating upon natural truths and principles, and introducing jargon andcontradiction, in the place of order, analogy, consistency, and uniformity.Further than this; legislation does not even profess to remove the obscurity ofnatural law. That is no part of its object. It only professes to substitutesomething arbitrary in the place of natural law. Legislators generally have thesense to see that legislation will not make natural law any clearer than it is.Neither is it the object of legislation to establish the authority of naturallaw. Legislators have the sense to see that they can add nothing to theauthority of natural law, and that it will stand on its own authority, unlessthey overturn it.The whole object of legislation, excepting that legislation which merely makesregulations, and provides instrumentalities for carrying other laws into effect,is to overturn natural law, and substitute for it the arbitrary will of power.In other words, the whole object of it is to destroy men’s rights. At least,such is its only effect; and its designs must be inferred from its effect.Taking all the statutes in the country, there probably is not one in ahundred,—except the auxiliary ones just mentioned,—that does not violate naturallaw; that does not invade some right or other.Yet the advocates of arbitrary legislation are continually practising the fraudof pretending that unless the legislature make the laws, the laws will not beknown. The whole object of the fraud is to secure to the government theauthority of making laws that never ought to be known.”In addition to the authority already cited, of Sir William Jones, as to thecertainty of natural law, and the uniformity of men’s opinions in regard to it,I may add the following:> “There is that great simplicity and plainness in the Common Law, that Lord> Coke has gone so far as to assert, (and Lord Bacon nearly seconds him in> observing,) that ‘he never knew two questions arise merely upon common law;> but that they were mostly owing to statutes ill-penned and overladen with> provisos.’”—3 Eunomus, 157–8.If it still be said that juries would disagree, as to what was natural justice,and that one jury would decide one way, and another jury another; the answer is,that such a thing is hardly credible, as that twelve men, taken at random fromthe people at large, should unanimously decide a question of natural justice oneway, and that twelve other men, selected in the same manner, should unanimouslydecide the same question the other way, unless they were misled by the justices.If, however, such things should sometimes happen, from any cause whatever, theremedy is by appeal, and new trial.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] Judges do not even live up to that part of their own maxim, which requiresjurors to try the matter of fact. By dictating to them the laws ofevidence,—that is, by dictating what evidence they may hear, and what they maynot hear, and also by dictating to them rules for weighing such evidence as theypermit them to hear,—they of necessity dictate the conclusion to which theyshall arrive. And thus the court really tries the question of fact, as well asthe question of law, in every cause. It is clearly impossible, in the nature ofthings, for a jury to try a question of fact, without trying every question oflaw on which the fact depends.[2] Most disagreements of juries are on matters of fact, which are admitted tobe within their province. We have little or no evidence of their disagreementson matters of natural justice. The disagreements of courts on matters of law,afford little or no evidence that juries would also disagree on matters oflaw—that is, of justice; because the disagreements of courts are generally onmatters of legislation, and not on those principles of abstract justice, bywhich juries would be governed, and in regard to which the minds of men arenearly unanimous.[3] This is the principle of all voluntary associations whatsoever. No voluntaryassociation was ever formed, and in the nature of things there never can be oneformed, for the accomplishment of any objects except those in which all theparties to the association are agreed. Government, therefore, must be keptwithin these limits, or it is no longer a voluntary association of all whocontribute to its support, but a mere tyranny established by a part over therest.All, or nearly all, voluntary associations give to a majority, or to some otherportion of the members less than the whole, the right to use some limited,discretion as to the means to be used to accomplish the ends in view; but theends themselves to be accomplished are always precisely defined, and are such asevery member necessarily agrees to, else he would not voluntarily join theassociation.Justice is the object of government, and those who support the government, mustbe agreed as to the justice to be executed by it, or they cannot rightfullyunite in maintaining the government itself.[4] Jones on Bailments, 133.[5] Kent, describing the difficulty of construing the written law, says:> “Such is the imperfection of language, and the want of technical skill in the> makers of the law, that statutes often give occasion to the most perplexing> and distressing doubts and discussions, arising from the ambiguity that> attends them. It requires great experience, as well as the command of a> perspicuous diction, to frame a law in such clear and precise terms, as to> secure it from ambiguous expressions, and from all doubts and criticisms upon> its meaning.”—Kent, 460.The following extract from a speech of Lord Brougham, in the House of Lords,confesses the same difficulty:> “There was another subject, well worthy of the consideration of government> during the recess,—the expediency, or rather the absolute necessity, of some> arrangement for the preparation of bills, not merely private, but public> bills, in order that legislation might be consistent and systematic, and that> the courts might not have so large a portion of their time occupied in> endeavoring to construe acts of Parliament, in many cases unconstruable, and m> most cases difficult to be construed.”—Law Reporter, 1848, p. 525.[6] This condemnation of written laws must, of course, be understood as applyingonly to cases where principles and rights are involved, and not as condemningany governmental arrangements, or instrumentalities, that are consistent withnatural right, and which must be agreed upon for the purpose of carrying naturallaw into effect. These things may be varied, as expediency may dictate, so onlythat they be allowed to infringe no principle of justice. And they must, ofcourse, be written, because they do not exist as fixed principles, or laws innature."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI.JURIES OF THE PRESENT DAY ILLEGAL.It may probably be safely asserted that there are, at this day, no legal juries,either in England or America. And if there are no legal juries, there is, ofcourse, no legal trial, nor “judgment,” by jury.In saying that there are probably no legal juries, I mean that there areprobably no juries appointed in conformity with the principles of the commonlaw.The term jury is a technical one, derived from the common law; and when theAmerican constitutions provide for the trial by jury, they provide for thecommon law trial by jury; and not merely for any trial by jury that thegovernment itself may chance to invent, and call by that name. It is the thing,and not merely the name, that is guarantied. Any legislation, therefore, thatinfringes any essential principle of the common law, in the selection of jurors,is unconstitutional; and the juries selected in accordance with such legislationare, of course, illegal, and their judgments void.It will also be shown, in a subsequent chapter,[1] that since Magna Carta, thelegislative power in England (whether king or parliament) has never had anyconstitutional authority to infringe, by legislation, any essential principle ofthe common law in the selection of jurors. All such legislation is as muchunconstitutional and void, as though it abolished the trial by jury altogether.In reality it does abolish it.What, then, are the essential principles of the common law, controlling theselection of jurors?They are two.1. That all the freemen, or adult male members of the state, shall be eligibleas jurors.[2]Any legislation which requires the selection of jurors to be made from a lessnumber of freemen than the whole, makes the jury selected an illegal one.If a part only of the freemen, or members of the state, are eligible as jurors,the jury no longer represent “the country,” but only a part of “the country.”If the selection of jurors can be restricted to any less number of freemen thanthe whole, it can be restricted to a very small proportion of the whole; andthus the government be taken out of the hands of “the country,” or the wholepeople, and be thrown into the hands of a few.That, at common law, the whole body of freemen were eligible as jurors issufficiently proved, not only by the reason of the thing, but by the followingevidence:1. Everybody must be presumed eligible, until the contrary be shown. We have noevidence, that I am aware of, of a prior date to Magna Carta, to disprove thatall freemen were eligible as jurors, unless it be the law of Ethelred, whichrequires that they be elderly[3] men. Since no specific age is given, it isprobable, I think, that this statute meant nothing more than that they be morethan twenty-one years old. If it meant anything more, it was probably contraryto the common law, and therefore void.2. Since Magna Carta, we have evidence showing quite conclusively that allfreemen, above the age of twenty-one years, were eligible as jurors.The Mirror of Justices, (written within a century after Magna Carta,) in thesection “Of Judges”—that is, jurors—says:> “All those who are not forbidden by law may be judges (jurors). To women it is> forbidden by law that they be judges; and thence it is, that feme coverts are> exempted to do suit in inferior courts. On the other part, a villein cannot be> a judge, by reason of the two estates, which are repugnants; persons attainted> of false judgments cannot be judges, nor infants, nor any under the age of> twenty-one years, nor infected persons, nor idiots, nor madmen, nor deaf, nor> dumb, nor parties in the pleas, nor men excommunicated by the bishop, nor> criminal persons. * * And those who are not of the Christian faith cannot be> judges, nor those who are out of the king’s allegiance.”—Mirror of Justices,> 59–60.In the section “Of Inferior Courts,” it is said:> “From the first assemblies came consistories, which we now call courts, and> that in divers places, and in divers manners; whereof the sheriffs held one> monthly, or every five weeks, according to the greatness or largeness of the> shires. And these courts are called county courts, where the judgment is by> the suitors, if there be no writ, and is by warrant of jurisdiction ordinary.> The other inferior courts are the courts of every lord of the fee, to the> likeness of the hundred courts. * * There are other inferior courts which the> bailiffs hold in every hundred, from three weeks to three weeks, by the> suitors of the freeholders of the hundred. All the tenants within the fees are> bounden to do their suit there, and that not for the service of their persons,> but for the service of their fees. But women, infants within the age of> twenty-one years, deaf, dumb, idiots, those who are indicted or appealed of> mortal felony, before they be acquitted, diseased persons, and excommunicated> persons are exempted from doing suit.”—Mirror of Justices, 50–51.In the section “Of the Sheriff’s Turns,” it is said:> “The sheriffs by ancient ordinances hold several meetings twice in the year in> every hundred; where all the freeholders within the hundred are bound to> appear for the service of their fees.”—Mirror of Justices, 50.The following statute was passed by Edward I., seventy years after Magna Carta:> “Forasmuch also as sheriffs, hundreders, and bailiffs of liberties, have used> to grieve those which be placed under them, putting in assizes and juries men> diseased and decrepit, and having continual or sudden disease; and men also> that dwelled not in the country at the time of the summons; and summon also an> unreasonable number of jurors, for to extort money from some of them, for> letting them go in peace, and so the assizes and juries pass many times by> poor men, and the rich abide at home by reason of their bribes; it is ordained> that from henceforth in one assize no more shall be summoned than four and> twenty; and old men above three score and ten years, being continually sick,> or being diseased at the time of the summons, or not dwelling in that country,> shall not be put in juries of petit assizes.”—St. 13 Edward ch. 38. (1285.)Although this command to the sheriffs and other officers, not to summon, asjurors, those who, from age and disease, were physically incapable of performingthe duties, may not, of itself, afford any absolute or legal implication, bywhich we can determine precisely who were, and who were not, eligible as jurorsat common law, yet the exceptions here made nevertheless carry a seemingconfession with them that, at common law, all male adults were eligible asjurors.But the main principle of the feudal system itself shows that all the full andfree adult male members of the state—that is, all who were free born, and hadnot lost their civil rights by crime, or otherwise—must, at common law, havebeen eligible as jurors. What was that principle? It was, that the state restedfor support upon the land, and not upon taxation levied upon the peoplepersonally. The lands of the country were considered the property of the state,and were made to support the state in this way. A portion of them was set apartto the king, the rents of which went to pay his personal and officialexpenditures, not including the maintenance of armies, or the administration ofjustice. War and the administration of justice were provided for in thefollowing manner. The freemen, or the free-born adult male members of thestate—who had not forfeited their political rights—were entitled to land ofright, (until all the land was taken up,) on condition of their renderingcertain military and civil services to the state. The military servicesconsisted in serving personally as soldiers, or contributing an equivalent inhorses, provisions, or other military supplies. The civil services consisted,among other things, in serving as jurors (and, it would appear, as witnesses) inthe courts of justice. For these services they received no compensation otherthan the use of their lands. In this way the state was sustained; and the kinghad no power to levy additional burdens or taxes upon the people. The personsholding lands on these terms were called freeholders—in later timesfreemen—meaning free and full members of the state.Now, as the principle of the system was that the freeholders held their lands ofthe state, on the condition of rendering these military and civil services asrents for their lands, the principle implies that all the freeholders wereliable to these rents, and were therefore eligible as jurors. Indeed, I do notknow that it has ever been doubted that, at common law, all the freeholders wereeligible as jurors. If all had not been eligible, we unquestionably should havehad abundant evidence of the exceptions. And if anybody, at this day, allege anyexceptions, the burden will be on him to prove them. The presumption clearly isthat all were eligible.The first invasion, which I find made, by the English statutes, upon this commonlaw principle, was made in 1285, seventy years after Magna Carta. It was thenenacted as follows:> “Nor shall any be put in assizes or juries, though they ought to be taken in> their own shire, that hold a tenement of less than the value of twenty> shillings yearly. And if such assizes and juries be taken out of the shire, no> one shall be placed in them who holds a tenement of less value than forty> shillings yearly at the least, except such as be witnesses in deeds or other> writings, whose presence is necessary, so that they be able to travel.”—St. 13> Edward I., ch. 38. (1285.)The next invasion of the common law, in this particular, was made in 1414, abouttwo hundred years after Magna Carta, when it was enacted:> “That no person shall be admitted to pass in any inquest upon trial of the> death of a man, nor in any inquest betwixt party and party in plea real, nor> in plea personal, whereof the debt or the damage declared amount to forty> marks, if the same person have not lands or tenements of the yearly value of> forty shillings above all charges of the same”—2 Henry V., st. 2, ch. 3.> (1414.)Other statutes on this subject of the property qualifications of jurors, aregiven in the note.[4]From these statutes it will be seen that, since 1285, seventy years after MagnaCarta, the common law right of all free British subjects to eligibility asjurors has been abolished, and the qualifications of jurors have been made asubject of arbitrary legislation. In other words, the government has usurped theauthority of selecting the jurors that were to sit in judgment upon its ownacts. This is destroying the vital principle of the trial by jury itself, whichis that the legislation of the government shall be subjected to the judgment ofa tribunal, taken indiscriminately from the whole people, without any choice bythe government, and over which the government can exercise no control. If thegovernment can select the jurors, it will, of course, select those whom itsupposes will be favorable to its enactments. And an exclusion of any of thefreemen from eligibility is a selection of those not excluded.It will be seen, from the statutes cited, that the most absolute authority overthe jury box—that is, over the right of the people to sit in juries—has beenusurped by the government; that the qualifications of jurors have beenrepeatedly changed, and made to vary from a freehold of ten shillings yearly, toone of “twenty pounds by the year at least above reprises.” They have also beenmade different, in the counties of Southampton, Surrey, and Sussex, from whatthey were in the other counties; different in Wales from what they were inEngland; and different in the city of London, and in the county of Middlesex,from what they were in any other part of the kingdom.But this is not all. The government has not only assumed arbitrarily to classifythe people, on the basis of property, but it has even assumed to give to some ofits judges entire and absolute personal discretion in the selection of thejurors to be impanelled in criminal cases, as the following statutes show.> “Be it also ordained and enacted by the same authority, that all panels> hereafter to be returned, which be not at the suit of any party, that shall be> made and put in afore any justice of gaol delivery or justices of peace in> their open sessions to inquire for the king, shall hereafter be reformed by> additions and taking out of names of persons by discretion of the same> justices before whom such panel shall be returned; and the same justices shall> hereafter command, the sheriff, or his ministers in his absence, to put other> persons in the same panel by their discretions; and that panel so hereafter to> be made, to be good and lawful. This act to endure only to the next> Parliament.”—11 Henry VII., ch. 24, sec. 6. (1495.)This act was continued in force by 1 Henry VIII., ch. 11, (1509,) to the end ofthe then next Parliament.It was reënacted, and made perpetual, by 3 Henry VIII., ch. 12. (1511.)These acts gape unlimited authority to the king’s justices to pack juries attheir discretion; and abolished the last vestige of the common law right of thepeople to sit as jurors, and judge of their own liberties, in the courts towhich the acts applied.Yet, as matters of law, these statutes were no more clear violations of thecommon law, the fundamental and paramount “law of the land,” than were thosestatutes which affixed the property qualifications before named; because, if theking, or the government, can select the jurors on the ground of property, it canselect them on any other ground whatever.Any infringement or restriction of the common law right of the whole body of thefreemen of the kingdom to eligibility as jurors, was legally an abolition of thetrial by jury itself. The juries no longer represented “the country,” but only apart of the country; that part, too, on whose favor the government chose to relyfor the maintenance of its power, and which it therefore saw fit to select asbeing the most reliable instruments for its purposes of oppression towards therest. And the selection was made on the same principle, on which tyrannicalgovernments generally select their supporters, viz., that of conciliating thosewho would be most dangerous as enemies, and most powerful as friends—that is,the wealthy.[5]These restrictions, or indeed any one of them, of the right of eligibility asjurors, was, in principle, a complete abolition of the English constitution; or,at least, of its most vital and valuable part. It was, in principle, anassertion of a right, on the part of the government, to select the individualswho were to determine the authority of its own laws, and the extent of its ownpowers. It was, therefore, in effect, the assertion of a right, on the part ofthe government itself, to determine its own powers, and the authority of its ownlegislation, over the people; and a denial of all right, on the part of thepeople, to judge of or determine their own liberties against the government. Itwas, therefore, in reality, a declaration of entire absolutism on the part ofthe government. It was an act as purely despotic, in principle, as would havebeen the express abolition of all juries whatsoever. By “the law of the land,”which the kings were sworn to maintain, every free adult male British subjectwas eligible to the jury box, with full power to exercise his own judgment as tothe authority and obligation of every statute of the king, which might comebefore him. But the principle of these statutes (fixing the qualifications ofjurors) is, that nobody is to sit in judgment upon the acts or legislation ofthe king, or the government, except those whom the government itself shallselect for that purpose. A more complete subversion of the essential principlesof the English constitution could not be devised.The juries of England are illegal for another reason, viz., that the statutescited require the jurors (except in London and a few other places) to befreeholders. All the other free British subjects are excluded; whereas, atcommon law, all such subjects are eligible to sit in juries, whether they befreeholders or not.It is true, the ancient common law required the jurors to be freeholders; butthe term freeholder no longer expresses the same idea that it did in the ancientcommon law; because no land is now holden in England on the same principle, orby the same tenure, as that on which all the land was held in the early times ofthe common law.As has heretofore been mentioned, in the early times of the common law the landwas considered the property of the state; and was all holden by the tenants, socalled, (that is, holders,) on the condition of their rendering certain militaryand civil services to the state, (or to the king as the representative of thestate,) under the name of rents. Those who held lands on these terms were calledfree tenants, that is, free holders—meaning free persons, or members of thestate, holding lands—to distinguish them from villeins, or serfs, who were notmembers of the state, but held their lands by a more servile tenure, and also todistinguish them from persons of foreign birth, outlaws, and all other persons,who were not members of the state.Every freeborn adult male Englishman (who had not lost his civil rights by crimeor otherwise) was entitled to land of right; that is, by virtue of his civilfreedom, or membership of the body politic. Every member of the state wastherefore a freeholder; and every freeholder was a member of the state. And themembers of the state were therefore called freeholders. But what is material tobe observed, is, that a man’s right to land was an incident to his civilfreedom; not his civil freedom an incident to his right to land. He was afreeholder because he was a freeborn member of the state; and not a freebornmember of the state because he was a freeholder; for this last would be anabsurdity.As the tenures of lands changed, the term freeholder lost its originalsignificance, and no longer described a man who held land of the state by virtueof his civil freedom, but only one who held it in fee-simple—that is, free ofany liability to military or civil services. But the government, in fixing thequalifications of jurors, has adhered to the term freeholder after that term hasceased to express the thing originally designated by it.The principle, then, of the common law, was, that every freeman, or freebornmale Englishman, of adult age, &c., was eligible to sit in juries, by virtue ofhis civil freedom, or his being a member of the state, or body politic. But theprinciple of the present English statutes is, that a man shall have a right tosit in juries because he owns lands in fee-simple. At the common law a man wasborn to the right to sit in juries. By the present statutes he buys that rightwhen he buys his land. And thus this, the greatest of all the political rightsof an Englishman, has become a mere article of merchandise; a thing that isbought and sold in the market for what it will bring.Of course, there can be no legality in such juries as these; but only in juriesto which every free or natural born adult male Englishman is eligible.The second essential principle of the common law, controlling the selection ofjurors, is, that when the selection of the actual jurors comes to be made, (fromthe whole body of male adults,) that selection shall be made in some mode thatexcludes the possibility of choice on the part of the government.Of course, this principle forbids the selection to be made by any officer of thegovernment.There seem to have been at least three modes of selecting the jurors, at thecommon law. 1. By lot.[6] 2. Two knights, or other freeholders, were appointed,(probably by the sheriff,) to select the jurors. 3. By the sheriff, bailiff, orother person, who held the court, or rather acted as its ministerial officer.Probably the latter mode may have been the most common, although there may besome doubt on this point.At the common law the sheriffs, bailiffs, and other officers were chosen by thepeople, instead of being appointed by the king. (4 Blackstone, 413. Introductionto Gilbert’s History of the Common Pleas, p. 2, note, and p. 4.) This has beenshown in a former chapter.[7] At common law, therefore, jurors selected by theseofficers were legally selected, so far as the principle now under discussion isconcerned; that is, they were not selected by any officer who was dependent onthe government.But in the year 1315, one hundred years after Magna Carta, the choice ofsheriffs was taken from the people, and it was enacted:> “That the sheriffs shall henceforth be assigned by the chancellor, treasurer,> barons of the exchequer, and by the justices. And in the absence of the> chancellor, by the treasurer, barons and justices.”—9 Edward II., st. 2.> (1315.)These officers, who appointed the sheriffs, were themselves appointed by theking, and held their offices during his pleasure. Their appointment of sheriffswas, therefore, equivalent to an appointment by the king himself. And thesheriffs, thus appointed, held their offices only during the pleasure of theking, and were of course mere tools of the king; and their selection of jurorswas really a selection by the king himself. In this manner the king usurped theselection of the jurors who were to sit in judgment upon his own laws.Here, then, was another usurpation, by which the common law trial by jury wasdestroyed, so far as related to the county courts, in which the sheriffspresided, and which were the most important courts of the kingdom. From thiscause alone, if there were no other, there has not been a legal jury in a countycourt in England, for more than five hundred years.In nearly or quite all the States of the United States the juries are illegal,for one or the other of the same reasons that make the juries in Englandillegal.In order that the juries in the United States may be legal—that is, inaccordance with the principles of the common law—it is necessary that everyadult male member of the state should have his name in the jury box, or beeligible as a juror. Yet this is the case in hardly a single state.In New Jersey, Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Mississippi, the jurorsare required to be freeholders. But this requirement is illegal, for the reasonthat the term freeholder, in this country, has no meaning analogous to themeaning it had in the ancient common law.In Arkansas, Missouri, Indiana, and Alabama, jurors are required to be“freeholders or householders.” Each of these requirements is illegal.In Florida, they are required to be “householders.”In Connecticut, Maine, Ohio, and Georgia, jurors are required to have thequalifications of “electors.”In Virginia, they are required to have a property qualification of one hundreddollars.In Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Indiana,Michigan, and Wisconsin, certain civil authorities of the towns, cities, andcounties are authorized to select, once in one, two, or three years, a certainnumber of the people—a small number compared with the whole—from whom jurors areto be taken when wanted; thus disfranchising all except the few thus selected.In Maine and Vermont, the inhabitants, by vote in town meeting, have a veto uponthe jurors selected by the authorities of the town.In Massachusetts, the inhabitants, by vote in town meeting, can strike out anynames inserted by the authorities, and insert others; thus making jurorselective by the people, and, of course, representatives only of a majority ofthe people.In Illinois, the jurors are selected, for each term of court, by the countycommissioners.In North Carolina, “the courts of pleas and quarter sessions * * shall selectthe names of such persons only as are freeholders, and as are well qualified toact as jurors, &c.; thus giving the courts power to pack the juries.”—(RevisedStatutes, 147.)In Arkansas, too, “It shall be the duty of the county court of each county * *to make out and cause to be delivered to the sheriff a list of not less thansixteen, nor more than twenty-three persons, qualified to serve as grandjurors;” and the sheriff is to summon such persons to serve as grand jurors.In Tennessee, also, the jurors are to be selected by the county courts.In Georgia, the jurors are to be selected by “the justices of the inferiorcourts of each county, together with the sheriff and clerk, or a majority ofthem.”In Alabama, “the sheriff, judge of the county court, and clerks of the circuitand county courts,” or “a majority of” them, select the jurors.In Virginia, the jurors are selected by the sheriffs; but the sheriffs areappointed by the governor of the state, and that is enough to make the juriesillegal. Probably the same objection lies against the legality of the juries insome other states.How jurors are appointed, and what are their qualifications, in New Hampshire,Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware, South Carolina, Kentucky, Iowa, Texas, andCalifornia, I know not. There is little doubt that there is some valid objectionto them, of the kinds already suggested, in all these states.In regard to jurors in the courts of the United States, it is enacted, by act ofCongress:> “That jurors to serve in the courts of the United States, in each state> respectively, shall have the like qualifications, and be entitled to the like> exemptions, as jurors of the highest court of law of such state now have and> are entitled to, and shall hereafter, from time to time, have and be entitled> to. and shall be designated by ballot, lot, or otherwise, according to the> mode of forming such juries now practised and hereafter to be practised> therein, in so far as such mode may be practicable by the courts of the United> States, or the officers thereof; and for this purpose, the said courts shall> have power to make all necessary rules and regulations for conforming the> designation and empanelling of jurors, in substance, to the laws and usages> now in force in such state; and, further, shall have power, by rule or order,> from time to time, to conform the same to any change in these respects which> may be hereafter adopted by the legislatures of the respective states for the> state courts.”—St. 1840, ch. 47, Statutes at Large, vol. 5, p. 394.In this corrupt and lawless manner, Congress, instead of taking care to preservethe trial by jury, so far as they might, by providing for the appointment oflegal juries—incomparably the most important of all our judicial tribunals, andthe only ones on which the least reliance can be placed for the preservation ofliberty—have given the selection of them over entirely to the control of anindefinite number of state legislatures, and thus authorized each statelegislature to adapt the juries of the United States to the maintenance of anyand every system of tyranny that may prevail in such state.Congress have as much constitutional right to give over all the functions of theUnited States government into the hands of the state legislatures, to beexercised within each state in such manner as the legislature of such stateshall please to exercise them, as they have to thus give up to theselegislatures the selection of juries for the courts of the United States.There has, probably, never been a legal jury, nor a legal trial by jury, in asingle court of the United States, since the adoption of the constitution.These facts show how much reliance can be placed in written constitutions, tocontrol the action of the government, and preserve the liberties of the people.If the real trial by jury had been preserved in the courts of the UnitedStates—that is, if we had had legal juries, and the jurors had known theirrights—it is hardly probable that one tenth of the past legislation of Congresswould ever have been enacted, or, at least, that, if enacted, it could have beenenforced.Probably the best mode of appointing jurors would be this: Let the names of allthe adult male members of the state, in each township, be kept in a jury box, bythe officers of the township; and when a court is to be held for a county orother district, let the officers of a sufficient number of townships be required(without seeing the names) to draw out a name from their boxes respectively, tobe returned to the court as a juror. This mode of appointment would guardagainst collusion and selection; and juries so appointed would be likely to be afair epitome of “the country.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] On the English Constitution.[2] Although all the freemen are legally eligible as jurors, any one maynevertheless be challenged and set aside, at the trial, for any special personaldisqualification; such as mental or physical inability to perform the duties;having been convicted, or being under charge, of crime; interest, bias, &c. Butit is clear that the common law allows none of these points to be determined bythe court, but only by “triers.”[3] What was the precise meaning of the Saxon word, which I have here calledelderly, I do not know. In the Latin translations it is rendered by seniores,which may perhaps mean simply those who have attained their majority.[4] In 1483 it was enacted, by a statute entitled “Of what credit and estatethose jurors must be which shall be impanelled in the Sheriff’s Turn.”> “That no bailiff nor other officer from henceforth return or impanel any such> person in any shire of England, to be taken or put in or upon any inquiry in> any of the said Turns, but such as be of good name and fame, and having lands> and tenements of freehold within the same shires, to the yearly value of> twenty shillings at the least, or else lands and tenements holden by custom of> manor, commonly called copy-hold within the said shires, to the yearly value> of twenty-six shillings eight pence over all charges at the least.”—1 Richard> III., ch. 4.

(1486.)A statute passed in 1494, in regard to jurors in the city of London, enacts:> “That no person nor persons hereafter be impanelled, summoned, or sworn in any> jury or inquest in courts within the same city, (of London,) except he be of> lands, tenements, or goods and chattels, to the value of forty marks;[4a] and> that no person or persons hereafter be impanelled, summoned, nor sworn in any> jury or inquest in any count within the said city, for lands or tenements, or> action personal, wherein the debt or damage amounteth to the sum of forty> marks, or above, except he be in lands, tenements, goods, or chattels, to the> value of one hundred marks.”—11 Henry VII., ch. 21. (1494.)The statute 4 Henry VIII., ch. 3, sec. 4, (1512) requires jurors in London tohave “goods to the value of one hundred marks.”> In 1494 it was enacted that “It shall be lawful to every sheriff of the> counties of Southampton, Surry, and Sussex, to impanel and summons twenty-four> lawful men of such, inhabiting within the precinct of his or their turns, as> owe suit to the same turn, whereof every one hath lands or freehold to the> yearly value of ten shillings, or copyhold lands to the yearly value of> thirteen shillings four pence, above all charges within any of the said> counties, or men of less livelihood, if there be not so many there,> notwithstanding the statute of 1 Richard III., ch. 4.

(1585.)> In 1664–5 it was enacted, “That all jurors (other than strangers upon trials> per medistatem linguæ) who are to be returned for the trials of issues joined> in any of (his) majesty’s courts of king’s bench, common pleas, or the> exchequer, or before justices of assize, or nisi prius, oyer and terminer,> gaol delivery, or general or quarter sessions of the peace, from and after the> twentieth day of April, which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand> six hundred and sixty-five, in any county of this realm of England, shall> every of them then have, in their own name, or in trust for thorn, within the> same county, twenty, pounds by the year, at least, above reprises, in their> own or their wives’ right, of freehold lands, or of ancient, demesne, or of> rents in fee, fee-tail, or for life.

(1692.)By the same statute, (sec. 18,) persons may be returned to serve upon the talesin any county of England, who shall have, within the same county, five pounds bythe year, above reprises, in the manner aforesaid.By St. 3 George II., ch. 25, sec, 19, 20, no one is to be a juror in London, whoshall not be “an householder within the sa,id city, and have lands, tenements,or personal estate, to the value of one hundred pounds.”By another statute, applicable only to the county of Middlesex, it is enacted,> “That all leaseholders, upon leases where the improved rents or value shall> amount to fifty pounds or upwards per annum, over and above all ground rents> or other reservations payable by virtue of the said leases, shall be liable> and obliged to serve upon juries when they shall be legally summoned for that> purpose,”—4 George ch. 7, sec, 3. (1731.)[4a] A mark was thirteen shillings and four pence.[5] Suppose these statutes, instead of disfranchising all whose freeholds wereof less than the standard value fixed by the statutes, had disfranchised allwhose freeholds were of greater value than the same standard—would anybody everhave doubted that such legislation was inconsistent with the Englishconstitution; or that it amounted to an entire abolition of the trial by jury?Certainly not. Yet it was as clearly inconsistent with the common law, or theEnglish constitution, to disfranchise those whose freeholds fell below anyarbitrary standard fixed by the government, as it would have been todisfranchise all whose freeholds rose above that standard.[6] Lingard says: “These compurgators or jurors * * were sometimes * * drawn, bylot.”—1 Lingard’s History of England, p. 300.[7] Chapter 4, p. 120, note."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VII.ILLEGAL JUDGES.It is a principle of Magna Carta, and therefore of the trial by jury, (for allparts of Magna Carta must be construed together,) that no judge or other officerappointed by the king, shall preside in jury trials, in criminal cases, or“pleas of the crown.”This provision is contained in the great charters of both John and Henry, and issecond in importance only to the provision guaranteeing the trial by jury, ofwhich it is really a part. Consequently, without the observance of thisprohibition, there can be no genuine or legal—that is, common law—trial by jury.At the common law, all officers who held jury trials, whether in civil orcriminal cases, were chosen by the people.[1]But previous to Magna Carta, the kings had adopted the practice of sendingofficers of their own appointment, called justices, into the counties, to holdjury trials in some cases; and Magna Carta authorizes this practice to becontinued so far as it relates to three kinds of civil actions, to wit: “noveldisseisin, mort de ancestor, and darrein presentment;”[2] but specially forbidsits being extended to criminal cases, or pleas of the crown.This prohibition is in these words:“Nullus vicecomes, constabularius, coronator, vel alii balivi nostri, teneantplacita coronæ nostræ.” (No sheriff, constable, coroner, or other our bailiffs,shall hold pleas of our crown.)—John’s Charter, ch. 53. Henry’s ditto, eh. 17.Some persons seem to have supposed that this was a prohibition merely uponofficers bearing the specific names of “sheriffs; constables, coroners andbailiffs,” to hold criminal trials. But such is not the meaning. If it were, thenamecould be changed, and the thing retained; and thus the prohibition be evaded.The prohibition applies (as will presently be seen) to all officers of the kingwhatsoever; and it sets up a distinction between officers of the king, (“ourbailiffs,”) and officers chosen by the people.The prohibition upon the king’s justices sitting in criminal trials, is includedin the words “vel alii balivi nostri,” (or other our bailiffs.) The word bailiffwas anciently a sort of general name for judicial officers and persons employedin and about the administration of justice. In modern times its use, as appliedto the higher grades of judicial officers, has been superseded by other words;and it therefore now, more generally, if not universally, signifies an executiveor police officer, a servant of courts, rather than one whose functions arepurely judicial.The word is a French word, brought into England by the Normans.> Coke says, “Baylife is a French word, and signifies an officer concerned in> the administration of justice of a certain province; and because a sheriff> hath an office concerning the administration of justice within his county, or> bailiwick, therefore he called his county baliva sua, (his bailiwick.)> > “I have heard great question made what the true exposition of this word> balivus is. In the statute of Magna Carta, cap. 28, the letter of that statute> is, nullus balivus de cætero ponat aliquem ad legem manifestam nec ad> juramentum simplici doquela sua sine testibus fidelibus ad hoc inductis.” (No> bailiff from henceforth shall put any one to his open law, nor to an oath (of> self-exculpation) upon his own simple accusation, or complaint, without> faithful witnesses brought in for the same.) “And some have said that balivus> in this statute signifieth any judge; for the law must be waged and made> before the judge. And this statute (say they) extends to the courts of common> pleas, king’s bench, &c., for they must bring with them fideles testes,> (faithful witnesses.) &c., and so hath been the usage to it his day.”—1 Coke’s> Inst., 168 b.Coke makes various references, in his margin to Bracton, Fleta, and otherauthorities, which I have not examined, but which, I presume, support theopinion expressed in this quotation.Coke also, in another place, under the head of the chapter just cited from MagnaCarta, that “no bailiff shall put any man to his open law,” &c., gives thefollowing commentary upon it, from the Mirror of Justices, from which it appearsthat in the time of Edward I., (1272 to 1307,) this word balivus was understoodto include all judicial, as well as all other, officers of the king.> The Mirror says: “The point which forbiddeth that no bailiff put a freeman to> his oath without suit, is to be understood in this mariner,—that no justice,> no minister of the king, nor other steward, nor bailiff, have power to make a> freeman make oath, (of self-exculpation,) without the king’s command,[3] nor> receive any plaint, without witnesses present who testify the plaint to be> true.”—Mirror of Justices, ch. 5, sec. 2, p. 257.Coke quotes this commentary, (in the original French,) and (hen endorses it inthese words:> “By this it appeareth, that under this word balivus, in this act, is> comprehended every justice, minister of the king, steward, and bailiff.”—2> Inst., 44.Coke also, in his commentary upon this very chapter of Magna Carta, thatprovides that “no sheriff, constable, coroner, or other our bailiffs, shall holdpleas of our crown,” expresses the opinion that it “is a general law,” (that is,applicable to all officers of the king,) “by reason of the words vel alii balivinostri, (or other our bailiffs,) under which words are comprehended all judgesor justices of any courts of justice.” And he cites a decision in the king’sbench, in the 17th year of Edward I., (1289,) as authority; which decision hecalls “a notable and leading judgment.”—2 Inst., 30–1.And yet Coke, in flat contradiction of this decision, which he quotes with suchemphasis and approbation, and in flat contradiction also of the definition herepeatedly gives of the word balivus, showing that it embraced all ministers ofthe king whatsoever, whether high or low, judicial or executive, fabricates anentirely gratuitous interpretation of this chapter of Magna Carta, and pretendsthat after all it only required that felonies should he tried before the king’sjustices, on account of their superior learning; and that it permitted alllesser offences to be tried before inferior officers, (meaning of course theking’s inferior officers.)—2 Inst., 30.And thus this chapter of Magna Carta, which, according to his own definition ofthe word balivus, applies to all officers of the king; and which, according tothe common and true definition of the term “pleas of the crown,” applies to allcriminal cases without distinction, and which, therefore, forbids any officer orminister of the king to preside in a jury trial in any criminal case whatsoever,he coolly and gratuitously interprets into a mere senseless provision for simplyrestricting the discretion of the king in giving names to his own officers whoshould preside at the trials of particular offences; as if the king, who madeand unmade all his officers by a word, could not defeat the whole object of theprohibition, by appointing such individuals as he pleased, to try such causes ashe pleased, and calling them by such names as he pleased, if he were butpermitted to appoint and name such officers at all; and as if it were of theleast importance what name an officer bore, whom the king might appoint to aparticular duty.[4]Coke evidently gives this interpretation solely because, as he was giving ageneral commentary on Magna Carta, he was bound to give some interpretation orother to every chapter of it: and for this chapter he could invent, orfabricate, (for it is a sheer fabrication,) no interpretation better suited tohis purpose than this. It seems never to have entered his mind, (or if it did,he intended that it should never enter the mind of anybody else,) that theobject of the chapter could be to deprive the king of the power of putting hiscreatures into criminal courts, to pack, cheat, and browbeat juries, and thusmaintain his authority by procuring the conviction of those who shouldtransgress his laws, or incur his displeasure.This example of Coke tends to show how utterly blind, or how utterly corrupt,English judges, (dependent upon the crown and the legislature), have been inregard to everything in Magna Carta, that went to secure the liberties of thepeople, or limit the power of the government.Coke’s interpretation of this chapter of Magna Carta is of a piece with hisabsurd and gratuitous interpretation of the words “nec super eum ibimus, necsuper eum mittemus,” which was pointed out in a former article, and by which heattempted to give a judicial power to the king and his judges, where Magna Cartahad given it only to a jury. It is also of a piece with his pretence that therewas a difference between fine and amercement, and that fines might be imposed bythe king, and that juries were required only for fixing amercements.These are some of the innumerable frauds by which the English people have beencheated out of the trial by jury.Ex uno disce omnes, From one judge learn the characters of all.[5]I give in the note additional and abundant authorities for the meaning ascribedto the word bailiff. The importance of the principle involved will be asufficient excuse for such an accumulation of authorities as would otherwise betedious and perhaps unnecessary.[6]The foregoing interpretation of the chapter of Magna Carta now under discussion,is corroborated by another chapter of Magna Carta, which specially provides thatthe king’s justices shall “go through every county” to “take the assizes” (holdjury trials) in three kinds of civil actions, to wit, “novel disseisin, mort deancestor, and darrein presentment;” but makes no mention whatever of theirholding jury trials in criminal cases,—an omission wholly unlikely to be made,if it were designed they should attend the trial of such causes. Besides, thechapter here spoken of (in John’s charter) does not allow these justices to sitalone in jury trials, even in civil actions; but provides that four knights,chosen by the county, shall sit with them to keep them honest. When the king’sjustices were known to be so corrupt and servile that the people would not eventrust them to sit alone, in jury trials, in civil actions, how preposterous isit to suppose that they would not only suffer them to sit, but to sit alone, incriminal ones.It is entirely incredible that Magna Carta, which makes such careful provisionin regard to the king’s justices sitting in civil actions, should make noprovision whatever as to their sitting in criminal trials, if they were to beallowed to sit in them at all. Yet Magna Carta has no provision whatever on thesubject.[7]But what would appear to make this matter absolutely certain is, that unless theprohibition that “no bailiff, &c., of ours shall hold pleas of our crown,” applyto all officers of the king, justices as well as others, it would be whollynugatory for any practical or useful purpose, because the prohibition could beevaded by the king, at any time, by simply changing the titles of his officers.Instead of calling them “sheriffs, coroners, constables and bailiffs,” he couldcall them “justices” or anything else he pleased; and this prohibition, soimportant to the liberty of the people, would then be entirely defeated. Theking also could make and unmake “justices” at his pleasure; and if he couldappoint any officers whatever to preside over juries in criminal trials, hecould appoint any tool that he might at any time find adapted to his purpose. Itwas as easy to make justices of Jeffreys and Scroggs, as of any other material;and to have prohibited all the king’s officers, except his justices, frompresiding in criminal trials, would therefore have been mere fool’s play.We can all perhaps form some idea, though few of us will be likely to form anyadequate idea, of what a different thing the trial by jury would have been inpractice, and of what would have been the difference to the liberties ofEngland, for five hundred years last past, had this prohibition of Magna Carta,upon the king’s officers sitting in the trial of criminal cases, been observed.The principle of this chapter of Magna Carta, as applicable to the governmentsof the United States of America, forbids that any officer appointed either bythe executive or legislative power, or dependent upon them for their salaries,or responsible to them by impeachment, should preside over a jury in criminaltrials. To have the trial a legal (that is, a common law) and true trial byjury, the presiding officers must be chosen by the people, and be entirely freefrom all dependence upon, and all accountability to, the executive andlegislative branches of the government.[8]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] The proofs of this principle of the common law have already been given onpage 120, note.There is much confusion and contradiction among authors as to the manner inwhich sheriffs and other officers were appointed; some maintaining that theywere appointed by the king, others that they were elected by the people. Iimagine that both these opinions are correct, and that several of the king’sofficers bore the same official names as those chosen by the people; and thatthis is the cause of the confusion that has arisen on the subject.It seems to be a perfectly well established fact that, at common law, severalmagistrates, bearing the names of aldermen, sheriffs, stewards, coroners andbailiffs, were chosen by the people; and yet it appears, from Magna Cartaitself, that some of the king’s officers (of whom he must have had many) werealso called “sheriffs, constables, coroners, and bailiffs.”But Magna Carta, in various instances, speaks of sheriffs and bailiffs as “oursheriffs and bailiffs;” thus apparently intending to recognize the distinctionbetween officers of the king, bearing those names, and other officers, bearingthe same official names, but chosen by the people. Thus it says that “no sheriffor bailiff of ours, or any other (officer), shall take horses or carts of anyfreeman for carriage, unless with the consent of the freeman himself.”—John’sCharter, ch. 36.In a kingdom subdivided into so many counties, hundreds, tithings, manors,cities and boroughs, each having a judicial or police organization of its own,it is evident that many of the officers must have been chosen by the people, ekethe government could not have maintained its popular character. On the otherhand, it is evident that the king, the executive power of the nation, must havehad large numbers of officers of his own in every part of the kingdom. And it isperfectly natural that these different sets of officers should, in manyinstances, bear the same official names; and, consequently that the king, whenspeaking of his own officers, as distinguished, from those chosen by the people,should call them “our sheriffs, bailiffs,” &c., as he does in Magna Carta.I apprehend that inattention to these considerations has been the cause of allthe confusion of ideas that has arisen on this subject,—a confusion very evidentin the following paragraph from Dunham, which may be given as an illustration ofthat which; is exhibited by others on the same points.> “Subordinate to the ealdormen were the gerefas, the sheriffs, or reeves, of> whom there were several in every shire, or county. There was one in every> borough, as a judge. There was one at every gate, who witnessed purchases> outside the walls; and there was one, higher than either,—the high> sheriff,—who was probably the reeve of the shire. This last appears to have> been appointed by the king. Their functions were to execute the decrees of the> king, or ealdormen, to arrest prisoners, to require bail for their appearance> at the sessions, to collect fines or penalties levied by the court of the> shire, to preserve the public peace, and to preside in a subordinate tribunal> of their own.”—Dunham’s Middle Ages, sec. 2, B. 2, ch. 1. 57 Lardner’s Cab.> Cyc., p. 41.The confusion of duties attributed to these officers indicates clearly enoughthat different officers, bearing the same official names, must have haddifferent duties, and have derived their authority from different sources,—towit, the king, and the people.[2] Darrein presentment was an inquest to discover who presented the last personto a church; mart de ancestor, whether the last possessor was seized of land indemesne of his own fee; and novel disseisin, whether the claimant had beenunjustly disseized of his freehold.[3] He has no power to do it, either with, or without, the king’s command. Theprohibition is absolute, containing no such qualification as is hereinterpolated, viz., “without the king’s command.” If it could be done with theking’s command, the king would be invested with arbitrary power in the matter.[4] The absurdity of this doctrine of Coke is made more apparent by the factthat, at that time, the “justices” and other persons appointed by the king tohold courts were not only dependent upon the king for their offices, andremovable at his pleasure, but that the usual custom was, not to appoint themwith any view to permanency, but only to give them special commissions fortrying a single cause, or far holding a single term of a court, or for making asingle circuit; which, being done, their commissions expired. The king,therefore, could, and undoubtedly did, appoint any individual he pleased, to tryany cause he pleased, with a special view to the verdicts he desired to obtainin the particular cases.This custom of commissioning particular persons to hold jury trials, in criminalcases, (and probably also in civil ones,) was of course a usurpation upon thecommon law, but had been practised more or less from the time of William theConqueror. Palgrave says:> “The frequent absence of William from his insular dominions occasioned another> mode of administration, which ultimately produced still greater changes in the> law. It was the practice of appointing justiciars to represent, the king’s> person, to hold his court, to decide his pleas, to dispense justice on his> behalf, to command the military levies, and to act as conservators of the> peace in the king’s name.[4a] . . The justices who were assigned in the name> of the sovereign, and whose powers were revocable at his pleasure, derived> their authority merely from their grant. . . Some of those judges were usually> deputed for the purpose of relieving the king from the burden of his judicial> functions . . . The number as well as the variety of names of the justices> appearing in the early chirographs of ‘Concords,’ leave reason for doubting> whether, anterior to the reign of Henry III., (1216 to 1272,) a court, whose> members were changing at almost every session, can be said to have been> permanently constituted. It seems more probable that the individuals who> composed the tribunal were selected as suited the pleasure of the sovereign,> and the convenience of the clerks and barons; and the history of our legal> administration will be much simplified, if we consider all those courts which> were afterwards denominated the Exchequer, the King’s Bench, the Common Pleas,> and the Chancery, as being originally committees, selected by the king when> occasion required, out of a large body, for the despatch of peculiar branches> of business, and which committees, by degrees, assumed an independent and> permanent existence. . . Justices itinerant, who, despatched throughout the> land, decided the ‘Pleas of the Crown,’ may be obscurely traced in the reign> of the Conqueror; not, perhaps, appointed with much regularity, but despatched> upon peculiar occasions and emergencies.”—1 Palgrave’s Rise and Progress, &c.,> p. 289 to 293.The following statute, passed in 1354, (139 years after Magna Carta,) shows thateven after this usurpation of appointing “justices” of his own, to try criminalcases, had probably become somewhat established in practice, in defiance ofMagna Carta, the king was in the habit of granting special commissions to stillother persons, (especially to sheriffs,—his sheriffs, no doubt,) to tryparticular cases:> “Because that the people of the realm have suffered many evils and mischiefs,> for that sheriffs of divers counties, by virtue of commissions and general> writs granted to them at their own suit, for their singular profit to gain of> the people, have made and taken divers inquests to cause to indict the people> at their will, and have taken fine and ransom of them to their own use, and> have delivered them; whereas such persons indicted were not brought before the> king’s justices to have their deliverance, it is accorded and established, for> to eschew all such evils and mischiefs, that such commissions and writs before> this time made shall be utterly repealed, and that from henceforth no such> commissions shall be granted.”—St. 28 Edward III., ch. 9, (1354.)How silly to suppose that the illegality of these commissions to try criminalcases, -could have been avoided by simply granting them to persons under thetitle of “justices,” instead of granting them to “sheriffs.” The statute wasevidently a cheat, or at least designed as such, inasmuch as it virtuallyasserts the right of the king to appoint his tools, under the name of“justices,” to try criminal cases, while it disavows his right to appoint themunder the name of “sheriffs.”> Millar says: “When the king’s bench came to have its usual residence at> Westminster, the sovereign was induced to grant special commissions, for> trying particular crimes, in such parts of the country as were found most> convenient; and this practice was gradually modelled into a regular> appointment of certain commissioners, empowered, at stated seasons, to perform> circuits over the kingdom, and to hold courts in particular towns, for the> trial of all sorts of crimes. These judges of the circuit, however, never> obtained an ordinary jurisdiction, but continued, on every occasion, to derive> their authority from two special commissions: that of oyer and terminer, by> which they were appointed to hear and determine all treasons, felonies and> misdemeanors, within certain districts; and that of gaol delivery, by which> they were directed to try every prisoner confined in the gaols of the several> towns falling under their inspection.”—Millar’s Hist. View of Eng. Gov., vol.> 2, ch. 7, p. 282.The following extract from Gilbert shows to what lengths of usurpation the kingswould sometimes go, in their attempts to get the judicial power out of the handsof the people, and entrust it to instruments of their own choosing:> “From the time of the Saxons,” (that is, from the commencement of the reign of> William the Conqueror,) “till the reign of Edward the first, (1272 to 1307,)> the several county courts and sheriffs courts did decline in their interest> and authority. The methods by which they were broken were two-fold. First, by> granting commissions to the sheriffs by writ of Justicies, whereby the sheriff> had a particular jurisdiction granted him to be judge of a particular cause,> independent of the suitors of the county court,” (that is, without a jury;)> “and these commissions were after the Norman form, by which (according to> which) all power of judicature was immediately derived from the king.”—Gilbert> on the Court of Chancery, p. 1.The several authorities now given show that it was the custom of the Normankings, not only to appoint persons to sit as judges in jury trials, in criminalcases, but that they also commissioned individuals to sit in singular andparticular cases, as occasion required; and that they therefore readily could,and naturally would, and therefore undoubtedly did, commission individuals witha special view to their adaptation or capacity to procure such judgments as thekings desired.The extract from Gilbert suggests also the usurpation of the Norman kings, intheir assumption that they, (and not the people, as by the common law,) were thefountains of justice. It was only by virtue of this illegal assumption that theycould claim to appoint their tools to hold courts.All these things show how perfectly lawless and arbitrary the kings were bothbefore and after Magna Carta, and how necessary to liberty was the principle ofMagna Carta and the common law, that no person appointed by the king should holdjury trials in criminal cases.[4a] In this extract, Palgrave seems to assume that the king himself had a rightto sit as judge, in jury trials, in the county courts, in both civil andcriminal cases. I apprehend he had no such power at the common law, but only tosit in the trial of appeals, and in the trial of peers, and of civil suits inwhich peers were parties, and possibly in the courts of ancient demesne.[5] The opinions and decisions of judges and courts are undeserving of the leastreliance, (beyond the intrinsic merit of the arguments offered to sustain them,)and are unworthy even to be quoted as evidence of the law, when those opinionsor decisions are favorable to the power of the government, or unfavorable to theliberties of the people. The only reasons that their opinions, when in favor ofliberty, are entitled to any confidence, are, first, that all presumptions oflaw are in favor of liberty; and, second, that the admissions of all men, theinnocent and the criminal alike, when made, against their own interests, areentitled to be received as true, because it is contrary to human nature for aman to confess anything but truth against himself.More solemn farces, or more gross impostures, were never practised upon mankind,than are all, or very nearly all, those oracular responses by which courtsassume to determine that certain statutes, in restraint of individual liberty,are within the constitutional power of the government, and are therefore validand binding upon the people.The reason why these courts are so intensely servile and corrupt, is, that theyare not only parts of, but the veriest creatures of, the very governments whoseoppressions they are thus seeking to uphold. They receive their offices andsalaries from, and are impeachable and removable by, the very governments uponwhose acts they affect to sit in judgment. Of course, no one with his eyes openever places himself in a position so incompatible with the liberty of declaringhis honest opinion, unless he do it with the intention of becoming a mereinstrument in the hands of the government for the execution of all itsoppressions.As proof of this, look at the judicial history of England for the last fivehundred years, and of America from its settlement. In all that time (so far as Iknow, or presume) no bench of judges, (probably not even any single judge,)dependent upon the legislature that passed the statute, has ever declared asingle penal statute invalid, on account of its being in conflict either withthe common law, which the judges in England have been sworn to preserve, or withthe written constitutions, (recognizing men’s natural rights,) which theAmerican judges were under oath to maintain. Every oppression, every atrocityeven, that has ever been enacted in either country, by the legislative power, inthe shape of a criminal law, (or, indeed, in almost any other shape,) has beenas sure of a sanction from the judiciary that was dependent upon, andimpeachable by, the legislature that enacted the law, as if there were aphysical necessity that the legislative enactment and the judicial sanctionshould go together. Practically speaking, the sum of their decisions, all andsingular, has been, that there are no limits to the power of the government, andthat the people have no rights except what the government pleases to allow tothem.It is extreme folly for a people to allow such dependent, servile, and perjuredcreatures to sit either in civil or criminal trials; but to allow them to sit incriminal trials, and judge of the people’s liberties, is not merely fatuity,—itis suicide.[6] Coke, speaking of the word bailiffs, as used in the statute of 1Westminster, ch. 35, (1275,) says:> “Here bailiffs are taken for the judges of the court, as manifestly appeareth> hereby.”—2 Inst., 221).Coke also says, It is a maxim in law, aliquis non debet esse judex in propriacausa, (no one ought to be judge in his own cause;) and therefore a fine leviedbefore the baylifes of Salop was reversed, because one of the baylifes was partyto the fine, quia non potest esse judex et pars,” (because one cannot be judgeand party.)—1 Inst., 141 a.In the statute of Gloucester, ch. 11 and 12, (1278,) “the mayor and bailiffs ofLondon (undoubtedly chosen by the people, or at any rate not appointed by theking) are manifestly spoken of as judges, or magistrates, holding jury trials,as follows:> Ch. II. “It is provided, also, that if any man lease his tenement in the city> of London, for a term of years, and he to whom the freehold belongeth causeth> himself to be impleaded by collusion, and maketh default after default, or> cometh into court and giveth it up, for to make the termor (lessee) lose his> term, (lease,) and the demandant hath his suit, so that the termor may recover> by writ of covenant; the mayor and bailiffs may inquire by a good inquest,> (jury,) in the presence of the termor and the demandant, whether the demandant> moved his plea upon good right that he had, or by collusion, or fraud, to make> the termor lose his term; and if it be found by the inquest (jury, that the> demandant moved his plea upon good right that he had, the judgment shall be> given forthwith; and if it be found by the inquest (jury) that he impleaded> him (self) by fraud, to put the termor from his term, then shall the termor> enjoy his term, and the execution of judgment for the demandant shall be> suspended until the term be expired.”—6 Edward I., ch. 11, (1278.)> Coke, in his commentary on this chapter, calls this court of “the mayor and> bailiffs” of London, “the court of the hustings, the greatest and highest> court in London;” and adds, “other cities have the like court, and so called,> as York, Lincoln, Winchester, &c. Here the city of London is named; but it> appeareth by that which hath been said out of Fleta, that this act extends to> such cities and boroughs privileged,—that is, such as have such privilege to> hold plea as London hath.”—2 Inst., 322.The 12th chapter of the same statute is in the following words, which plainlyrecognize the fact that “the mayor and bailiffs of London” are judicial officersholding courts in London.> “It is provided, also, that if a man, impleaded for a tenement in the same> city, (London,) doth vouch a foreigner to warranty, that he shall come into> the chancery, and have a writ to summon his warrantor at a certain day before> the justices of the bench, and another writ to the mayor and bailiffs of> London, that they shall surcease (suspend proceedings) in the matter that is> before them by writ, until the plea of the warrantee be determined before the> justices of the bench; and when the plea at the bench shall be determined,> then shall he that is vouched be commanded to go into the city,” (that is,> before “the mayor and bailiffs’” court,) “to answer unto the chief plea; and a> writ shall be awarded at the suit of the demandant by the justices unto the> mayor and bailiffs, that they shall proceed in the plea,” &c.—6 Edward I., ch.> 12, (1278.)> Coke, in his commentary on this chapter, also speaks repeatedly of “the mayor> and bailiffs” as judges holding courts; and also speaks of this chapter as> applicable not only to “the citie of London, specially named for the cause> aforesaid, but extended by equity to all other privileged places,” (that is,> privileged to have a court of “mayor and bailiffs,”) “where foreign voucher is> made, as to Chester, Durham, Salop,” &c.—2 Inst., 325–7.> Bailie.—In Scotch law, a municipal magistrate, corresponding with the English> alderman.[6a]—Burrill’s Law Dictionary.> > Bailiffs.—Baillif.

These were alljudicial officers. See Law Dictionaries.[6b] “Ban and arriere ban, a proclamation, whereby all that hold lands of thecrown, (except some privileged officers and citizens,) are summoned to meet at acertain place in order to serve the king in his wars, either personally, or byproxy.”—Boyer.[7] Perhaps it may be said (and such, it has already been seen, is the opinionof Coke and others) that the chapter of Magna Carta, that “no bailiff fromhenceforth shall put any man to his open law, (put him on trial,) nor to an oath(that is, an oath of self-exculpation) upon his (the bailiff’s) own accusationor testimony, without credible witnesses brought in to prove the charge,” isitself a “provision in regard to the king’s justices sitting in criminaltrials,” and therefore implies that they are to sit in such trials.But, although the word bailiff includes all judicial, as well as other,officers, and would therefore in this case apply to the king’s justices, if theywere to sit in criminal trials; yet this particular chapter of Magna Cartaevidently does not contemplate “bailiffs” while acting in their judicialcapacity, (for they were not allowed to sit in criminal trials at all,) but onlyin the character of witnesses; and that the meaning of the chapter is, that thesimple testimony (simplici loquela) of “no bailiff,” (of whatever kind,)unsupported by other and “credible witnesses,” shall be sufficient to put anyman on trial, or to his oath of self-exculpation.[7a]It will be noticed that the words of this chapter are not, no bailiff ofours,”—that is, of the king,—as in some other chapters of Magna Carta; butsimply “no bailiff,” &c. The prohibition, therefore, applies to all“bailiffs,”—to those chosen by the people, as well as those appointed by theking. And the prohibition is obviously founded upon the idea (a very sound onein that age certainly, and probably also in this) that public officers (whetherappointed by king or people) have generally, or at least frequently, too manyinterests and animosities against accused persons, to make it safe to convictany man on their testimony alone.The idea of Coke and others, that the object of this chapter was simply toforbid magistrates to put a man on trial, when there were no witnesses againsthim, but only the simple accusation or testimony of the magistrates themselves,before whom he way to be tried, is preposterous; for that would be equivalent tosupposing that magistrate acted in the triple character of judge, jury andwitnesses, in the same trial; and that, therefore, in such cases, they needed tobe prohibited from condemning a man on their own accusation or testimony alone.But such a provision would have been unnecessary and senseless, for two reasons;first, because the bailiffs or magistrates had no power to “hold pleas of thecrown,” still less to try or condemn a man; that power resting wholly with thejuries; second, because if bailiffs or magistrates could try and condemn a man,without a jury, the prohibition upon their doing so upon their own accusation ortestimony alone, would give no additional protection to the accused, so long asthese same bailiffs or magistrates were allowed to decide what weight should begiven, both to their own testimony and that of other witnesses; for, if theywished to convict, they would of course decide that any testimony, howeverfrivolous or irrelevant, in addition to their own, was sufficient. Certainly amagistrate could always procure witnesses enough to testify to something orother, which he himself could decide to be corroborative of his own testimony.And thus the prohibition would be defeated in fact, though observed in form.[7a] At the common law, parties, in both civil and criminal cases, were allowedto swear in their own behalf; and it will be so again, if the true trial by juryshould be reëstablished.[8] In this chapter I have called the justices “presiding officers,” solely forthe want of a better term. They are not “presiding officers,” in the sense ofhaving any authority over the jury; but are only assistants to, and teachers andservants of, the jury. The foreman of the jury is properly the “presidingofficer,” so far as there is such an officer at all. The sheriff has noauthority except over other persons than the jury."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII.THE FREE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.The free administration of justice was a principle of the common law; and itmust necessarily be a part of every system of government which is not designedto be an engine in the hands of the rich for the oppression of the poor.In saying that the free administration of justice was a principle of the commonlaw, I mean only that parties were subjected to no costs for jurors, witnesses,writs, or other necessaries for the trial, preliminary to the trial itself.Consequently, no one could lose the benefit of a trial, for the want of means todefray expenses. But after the trial, the plaintiff or defendant was liable tobe amerced, (by the jury, of course,) for having troubled the court with theprosecution or defence of an unjust suit.[1] But it is not likely that thelosing party was subjected to an amercement as a matter of course, but only inthose cases where the injustice of his cause was so evident as to make himinexcusable in bringing it before the courts.All the freeholders were required to attend the courts, that they might serve asjurors and witnesses, and do any other service that could legally be required ofthem; and their attendance was paid for by the state. In other words, theirattendance and service at the courts were part of the rents which they paid thestate for their lands.The freeholders, who were thus required always to attend the courts, weredoubtless the only witnesses who were usually required in civil causes. This wasowing to the fact that, in those days, when the people at large could neitherwrite nor read, few contracts were put in writing. The expedient adopted forproving contracts, was that of making them in the presence of witnesses, whocould afterwards testify to the transactions. Most contracts in regard to landswere made at the courts, in the presence of the freeholders there assembled.[2]In the king’s courts it was specially provided by Magna Carta that “justice andright” should not be “sold;” that is, that the king should take nothing from theparties for administering justice.The oath of a party to the justice of his cause was all that was necessary toentitle him to the benefit of the courts free of all expense; (except the riskof being amerced after the trial, in case the jury should think he deservedit.[3])This principle of the free administration of justice connects itself necessarilywith the trial by jury, because a jury could not rightfully give judgmentagainst any man, in either a civil or criminal case, if they had any reason tosuppose he had, been unable to procure his witnesses.The true trial by jury would also compel the free administration of justice fromanother necessity, viz., that of preventing private quarrels; because, unlessthe government enforced a man’s rights and redressed his wrongs, free of expenseto him, a jury would be bound to protect him in taking the law into his ownhands. A man has a natural right to enforce his own rights and redress his ownwrongs. If one man owe another a debt, and refuse to pay it, the creditor has anatural right to seize sufficient property of the debtor, wherever he can findit, to satisfy the debt. If one man commit a trespass upon the person, propertyor character of another, the injured party has a natural right, either tochastise the aggressor, or to take compensation for the injury out of hisproperty. But as the government is an impartial party as between theseindividuals, it is more likely to do exact justice between them than the injuredindividual himself would do. The government, also, having more power at itscommand, is likely to right a man’s wrongs more peacefully than the injuredparty himself could do it. If, therefore, the government will do the work ofenforcing a man’s rights, and redressing his wrongs, promptly, and free ofexpense to him, he is under a moral obligation to leave the work in the hands ofthe government; but not otherwise. When the government forbids him to enforcehis own rights or redress his own wrongs, and deprives him of all means ofobtaining justice, except on the condition of his employing the government toobtain it for him, and of paying the government for doing it, the governmentbecomes itself the protector and accomplice of the wrong-doer. If the governmentwill forbid a man to protect his own rights, it is bound to do it for him, freeof expense to him. And so long as government refuses to do this, juries, if theyknew their duties, would protect a man in defending his own rights.Under the prevailing system, probably one half of the community are virtuallydeprived of all protection for their rights, except what the criminal lawaffords them. Courts of justice, for all civil suits, are as effectually shutagainst them, as though it were done by bolts and bars. Being forbidden tomaintain their own rights by force,—as, for instance, to compel the payment ofdebts,—and being unable to pay the expenses of civil suits, they have noalternative but submission to many acts of injustice, against which thegovernment, is bound either to protect them, free of expense, or allow them toprotect themselves.There would be the same reason in compelling a party to pay the judge and juryfor their services, that there is in compelling him to pay the witnesses, or anyother necessary charges.[4]This compelling parties to pay the expenses of civil suits is one of the manycases in which government is false to the fundamental principles on which freegovernment is based. What is the object of government, but to protect men’srights? On what principle does a man pay his taxes to the government, except onthat of contributing his proportion towards the necessary cost of protecting therights of all? Yet, when his own rights are actually invaded, the government,which he contributes to support, instead of fulfilling its implied contract,becomes his enemy, and not only refuses to protect his rights, (except at hisown cost,) but even forbids him to do it himself.All free government is founded on the theory of voluntary association; and onthe theory that all the parties to it voluntarily pay their taxes for itssupport, on the condition of receiving protection in return. But the idea thatany poor man would voluntarily pay taxes to build up a government, which willneither protect his rights, (except at a cost which he cannot meet,) nor sufferhimself to protect them by such means as may be in his power, is absurd.Under the prevailing system, a large portion of the lawsuits determined incourts, are mere contests of purses rather than of rights. And a jury, sworn todecide causes “according to the evidence” produced, are quite likely, for aughtthey themselves can know, to be deciding merely the comparative length of theparties’ purses, rather than the intrinsic strength of their respective rights.Jurors ought to refuse to decide a cause at all, except upon the assurance thatall the evidence, necessary to a full knowledge of the cause, is produced. Thisassurance they can seldom have, unless the government itself produces all thewitnesses the parties desire.In criminal cases, the atrocity of accusing a man of crime, and then condemninghim unless he prove his innocence at his own charges, is so evident that a jurycould rarely, if ever, be justified in convicting a man under suchcircumstances.But the free administration of justice is not only indispensable to themaintenance of right between man and man; it would also promote simplicity andstability in the laws. The mania for legislation would be, in an importantdegree, restrained, if the government were compelled to pay the expenses of allthe suits that grew out of it.The free administration of justice would diminish and nearly extinguish anothergreat evil,—that of malicious civil suits. It is an old saying, that “multilitigant in foro, non ut aliquid lucrentur, sed ut vexant alios.” (Many litigatein court, not that they may gain anything, but that they may harass others.)Many men, from motives of revenge and oppression, are willing to spend their ownmoney in prosecuting a groundless suit, if they can thereby compel theirvictims, who are less able than themselves to bear the loss, to spend money inthe defence. Under the prevailing system, in which the parties pay the expensesof their suits, nothing but money is necessary to enable any malicious man tocommence and prosecute a groundless suit, to the terror, injury, and perhapsruin, of another man. In this way, a court of justice, into which none but aconscientious plaintiff certainly should ever be allowed to enter, becomes anarena into which any rich and revengeful oppressor may drag any man poorer thanhimself, and harass, terrify, and impoverish him, to almost any extent. It is ascandal and an outrage, that government should suffer itself to be made aninstrument, in this way, for the gratification of private malice. We mightnearly as well have no courts of justice, as to throw them open, as we do, forsuch flagitious uses. Yet the evil probably admits of no remedy except a freeadministration of justice. Under a free system, plaintiffs could rarely beinfluenced by motives of this kind; because they could put their victim tolittle or no expense, neither pending the suit, (which it is the object of theoppressor to do,) nor at its termination. Besides, if the ancient common lawpractice should be adopted, of amercing a party for troubling the courts withgroundless suits, the prosecutor himself would, in the end, be likely to beamerced by the jury, in such a manner as to make courts of justice a veryunprofitable place for a man to go to seek revenge.In estimating the evils of this kind, resulting from the present system, we areto consider that they are not, by any means, confined to the actual suits inwhich this kind of oppression is practised; but we are to include all thosecases in which the fear of such oppression is used as a weapon to compel meninto a surrender of their rights.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] 2 Sullivan Lectures, 234–5. 3 Blackstone, 274–5, 376. Sullivan says thatboth plaintiffs and defendants were liable to amercement. Blackstone speaks ofplaintiffs being liable, without saying whether defendants were so or not. Whatthe rule really was I do not know. There would seem to be some reason inallowing defendants to defend themselves, at their own charges, without exposingthemselves to amercement in case of failure.[2] When any other witnesses than freeholders were required in a civil suit, Iam not aware of the manner in which their attendance was procured; but it wasdoubtless done at the expense either of the state or of the witnessesthemselves. And it was doubtless the same in criminal cases.[3] “All claims were established in the first stage by the oath of the plaintiffexcept when otherwise specially directed by the law. The oath, by which anyclaim was supported, was called the fore-oath, or ‘Præjuramentum,’ and it wasthe foundation of his suit. One of the cases which did not require thisinitiatory confirmation, was when cattle could be tracked into another man’sland, and then the foot-mark stood for the fore-oath.”—2 Palgrave’s Rise andProgress, &c., 114.[4] Among the necessary expenses of suits, should be reckoned reasonablecompensation to counsel, for they are nearly or quite as important to theadministration of justice, as are judges, jurors, or witnesses; and theuniversal practice of employing them, both on the part of governments and ofprivate persons, shows that their importance is generally understood. As a merematter of economy, too, it would be wise for the government to pay them, ratherthan they should not be employed; because they collect and arrange the testimonyand the law beforehand, so as to be able to present the whole case to the courtand jury intelligibly, and in a short space of time. Whereas, if they were notemployed, the court and jury would be under the necessity either of spendingmuch more time than now in the investigation of causes, or of despatching themin haste, and with little regard to justice. They would be very likely to do thelatter, thus defeating the whole object of the people in establishing courts.To prevent the abuse of this right, it should perhaps be left discretionary withthe jury in each case to determine whether the counsel should receive anypay—and, if any, how much—from the government."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX.THE CRIMINAL INTENT.It is a maxim of the common law that there can be no crime without a criminalintent. And it is a perfectly clear principle, although one which judges have ina great measure overthrown in practice, that jurors are to judge of the moralintent of an accused person, and hold him guiltless, whatever his act, unlessthey find him to have acted with a criminal intent; that is, with a design to dowhat he knew to be criminal.This principle is clear, because the question for a jury to determine is,whether the accused be guilty, or not guilty. Guilt is a personal quality of theactor,—not necessarily involved in the act, but depending also upon the intentor motive with which the act was done. Consequently, the jury must find that heacted from a criminal motive, before they can declare him guilty.There is no moral justice in, nor any political necessity for, punishing a manfor any act whatever that he may have committed, if he have done it without anycriminal intent. There can be no moral justice in punishing for such an act,because, there having been no criminal motive, there can have been no othermotive which justice can take cognizance of, as demanding or justifyingpunishment. There can be no political necessity for punishing, to warn againstsimilar acts in future, because, if one man have injured another, howeverunintentionally, he is liable, and justly liable, to a civil suit for damages;and in this suit he will be compelled to make compensation for the injury,notwithstanding his innocence of any intention to injure. He must bear theconsequences of his own act, instead of throwing them upon another, howeverinnocent he may have been of any intention to do wrong. And the damages he willhave to pay will be a sufficient warning to him not to do the like act again.If it be alleged that there are crimes against the public, (as treason, forexample, or any other resistance to government,) for which private persons canrecover no damages, and that there is a political necessity for punishing forsuch offences, even though the party acted conscientiously, the answer is,—thegovernment must bear with all resistance that is not so clearly wrong as to giveevidence of criminal intent. In other words, the government, in all its acts,must keep itself so clearly within the limits of justice, as that twelve men,taken at random, will all agree that it is in the right, or it must incur therisk of resistance, without any power to punish it. This is the mode in whichthe trial by jury operates to prevent the government from falling into the handsof a party, or a faction, and to keep it within such limits as all, orsubstantially all, the people are agreed that it may occupy.This necessity for a criminal intent, to justify conviction, is proved by theissue which the jury are to try, and the verdict they are to pronounce. The“issue” they are to try is, “guilty,” or “not guilty.” And those are the termsthey are required to use in rendering their verdicts. But it is a plainfalsehood to say that a man is “guilty,” unless he have done an act which heknew to be criminal.This necessity for a criminal intent—in other words, for guilt—as a preliminaryto conviction, makes it impossible that a man can be rightfully convicted for anact that is intrinsically innocent. though forbidden by the government; becauseguilt is an intrinsic quality of actions and motives, and not one that can beimparted to them by arbitrary legislation. All the efforts of the government,therefore, to “make offences by statute,” out of acts that are not criminal bynature, must necessarily be ineffectual, unless a jury will declare a man“guilty” for an act that is really innocent.The corruption of judges, in their attempts to uphold the arbitrary authority ofthe government, by procuring the conviction of individuals for acts innocent inthemselves, and forbidden only by some tyrannical statute, and the commission ofwhich therefore indicates no criminal intent, is very apparent.To accomplish this object, they have in modern times held it to be unnecessarythat indictments should charge, as by the common law they were required to do,that an act was done “wickedly,” “feloniously,” “with malice aforethought,” orin any other manner that implied a criminal intent, without which there can beno criminality; but that it is sufficient to charge simply that it was done“contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.” This formof indictment proceeds plainly upon the assumption that the government isabsolute, and that it has authority to prohibit any act it pleases, howeverinnocent in its nature the act may be. Judges have been driven to thealternative of either sanctioning this new form of indictment, (which they neverhad any constitutional right to sanction,) or of seeing the authority of many ofthe statutes of the government fall to the ground; because the acts forbidden bythe statutes were so plainly innocent in their nature, that even the governmentitself had not the face to allege that the commission of them implied orindicated any criminal intent.To get rid of the necessity of showing a criminal intent, and thereby further toenslave the people, by reducing them to the necessity of a blind, unreasoningsubmission to the arbitrary will of the government, and of a surrender of allright, on their own part, to judge what are their constitutional and naturalrights and liberties, courts have invented another idea, which they haveincorporated among the pretended maxims, upon which they act in criminal trials,viz., that “ignorance of the late excuses no one.” As if it were in the natureof things possible that there could be an excuse more absolute and complete.What else than ignorance of the law is it that excuses persons under the yearsof discretion, and men of imbecile minds? What else than ignorance of the law isit that excuses judges themselves for all their erroneous decisions? Nothing.They are every day committing errors, which would be crimes, but for theirignorance of the law. And yet these same judges, who claim to be learned in thelaw, and who yet could not hold their offices for a day, but for the allowancewhich the law makes for their ignorance, are continually asserting it to be a“maxim” that “ignorance of the law excuses no one;” (by which, of course, theyreally mean that it excuses no one but themselves; and especially that itexcuses no unlearned man, who comes before them charged with crime).This preposterous doctrine, that “ignorance of the law excuses no one,” isasserted by courts because it is an indispensable one to the maintenance ofabsolute power in the government. It is indispensable for this purpose, because,if it be once admitted that the people have any rights and liberties which thegovernment cannot lawfully take from them, then the question arises in regard toevery statute of the government, whether it be law, or not; that is, whether itinfringe, or not, the rights and liberties of the people. Of this question everyman must of course judge according to the light in his own mind. And no man canbe convicted unless the jury find, not only that the statute is law,—that itdoes not infringe the rights and liberties of the people,—but also that it wasso clearly law, so clearly consistent with the rights and liberties of thepeople, as that the individual himself, who transgressed it, knew it to be so,and therefore had no moral excuse for transgressing it. Governments see that ifignorance of the law were allowed to excuse a man for any act whatever, it mustexcuse him for transgressing all statutes whatsoever, which he himself thinksinconsistent with his rights and liberties. But such a doctrine would of coursebe inconsistent with the maintenance of arbitrary power by the government; andhence governments will not allow the plea, although they will not confess theirtrue reasons for disallowing it.The only reasons, (if they deserve the name of reasons), that I ever knew givenfor the doctrine that ignorance of the law excuses no one, are these:1. “The reason for the maxim is that of necessity. It prevails, ‘not that allmen know the law, but because it is an excuse which every man will make, and noman can tell how to confute him.’—Selden, (as quoted in the 2d edition ofStarkie on Slander, Prelim. Disc., p. 140, note.)”—Law Magazine, (London,) vol.27, p. 97.This reason impliedly admits that ignorance of the law is, intrinsically, anample and sufficient excuse for a crime; and that the excuse ought to beallowed, if the fact of ignorance could but be ascertained. But it asserts thatthis fact is incapable of being ascertained, and that therefore there is anecessity for punishing the ignorant and the knowing—that is, the innocent andthe guilty—without discrimination.This reason is worthy of the doctrine it is used to uphold; as if a plea ofignorance, any more than any other plea, must necessarily be believed simplybecause it is urged; and as if it were not a common and every-day practice ofcourts and juries, in both civil and criminal cases, to determine the mentalcapacity of individuals; as, for example, to determine whether they are ofsufficient mental capacity to make reasonable contracts; whether they arelunatic; whether they are compotes mentis, “of sound mind and memory,” &c. &c.And there is obviously no more difficulty in a jury’s determining whether anaccused person knew the law in a criminal case, than there is in determining anyof these other questions that are continually determined in regard to a man’smental capacity. For the question to be settled by the jury is not whether theaccused person knew the particular penalty attached to his act, (for at commonlaw no one knew what penalty a jury would attach to an offence,) but whether heknew that his act was intrinsically criminal. If it were intrinsically criminal,it was criminal at common law. If it was not intrinsically criminal, it was notcriminal at common law. (At least, such was the general principle of the commonlaw. There may have been exceptions in practice, owing to the fact that theopinions of men, as to what was intrinsically criminal, may not have been in allcases correct.)A jury, then, in judging whether an accused person knew his act to be illegal,were bound first to use their own judgments, as to whether the act wereintrinsically criminal. If their own judgments told them the act wasintrinsically and clearly criminal, they would naturally and reasonably inferthat the accused also understood that it was intrinsically criminal, (andconsequently illegal,) unless it should appear that he was either belowthemselves in the scale of intellect, or had had less opportunities of knowingwhat acts were criminal. In short, they would judge, from any and every meansthey might have of judging; and if they had any reasonable doubt that he knewhis act to be criminal in itself, they would be bound to acquit him.The second reason that has been offered for the doctrine that ignorance of thelaw excuses no one, is this:> “Ignorance of the municipal law of the kingdom, or of the penalty thereby> inflicted on offenders, doth not excuse any that is of the age of discretion> and compos mentis, from the penalty of the breach of it; because every person,> of the age of discretion and compos mentis, is bound to know the law, and> presumed to do so. Ignorantia eorum, quæ quis scire tenetur non excusat.”> (Ignorance of those things which every one is bound to know, does not> excuse.)—1 Hale’s Pleas of the Crown, 42. Doctor and Student, Dialog. 2, ch.> 46. Law Magazine, (London,) vol. 27, p. 97.The sum of this reason is, that ignorance of the law excuses no one, (who is ofthe age of discretion and is compos mentis,) because every such person “is boundto know the law.” But this is giving no reason at all for the doctrine, sincesaying that a man “is bound to know the law,” is only saying, in another form,that “ignorance of the law does not excuse him.” There is no difference at allin the two ideas. To say, therefore, that “ignorance of the law excuses no one,because every one is bound to know the law,” is only equivalent to saying that“ignorance of the law excuses no one, because ignorance of the law excuses noone.” It is merely reasserting the doctrine, without giving any reason at all.And yet these reasons, which are really no reasons at all, are the only ones, sofar as I know, that have ever been offered for this absurd and brutal doctrine.The idea suggested, that “the age of discretion” determines the guilt of aperson,—that there is a particular age, prior to which all persons alike shouldbe held incapable of knowing any crime, and subsequent to which all personsalike should be held capable of knowing all crimes,—is another of this mostridiculous nest of ideas. All mankind acquire their knowledge of crimes, as theydo of other things, gradually. Some they learn at an early age; others not tilla later one. One individual acquires a knowledge of crimes, as he does ofarithmetic, at an earlier age than others do. And to apply the same presumptionto all, on the ground of age alone, is not only gross injustice, but grossfolly. A universal presumption might, with nearly or quite as much reason, befounded upon weight, or height, as upon age.[1]This doctrine, that ignorance of the law excuses no one,” is constantly repeatedin the form that “every one is bound to know the law.” The doctrine is true incivil matters, especially in contracts, so far as this: that no man, who has theordinary capacity to make reasonable contracts, can escape the consequences ofhis own agreement, on the ground that he did not know the law applicable to it.When a man makes a contract, he gives the other party rights; and he must ofnecessity judge for himself, and take his own risk, as to what those rightsare,—otherwise the contract would not be binding, and men could not makecontracts that would convey rights to each other. Besides, the capacity to makereasonable contracts, implies and includes a capacity to form a reasonablejudgment as to the law applicable to them. But in criminal matters, where thequestion is one of punishment, or not; where no second party has acquired anyright to have the crime punished, unless it were committed with criminal intent,(but only to have it compensated for by damages in a civil suit;) and when thecriminal intent is the only moral justification for the punishment, theprinciple does not apply, and a man is bound to know the law only as well as hereasonably may. The criminal law requires neither impossibilities norextraordinaries of any one. It requires only thoughtfulness and a goodconscience. It requires only that a man fairly and properly use the judgment hepossesses, and the means he has of learning his duty. It requires of him onlythe same care to know his duty in regard to the law, that he is morally bound touse in other matters of equal importance. And this care it does require of him.Any ignorance of the law, therefore, that is unnecessary, or that arises fromindifference or disregard of one’s duty, is no excuse. An accused person,therefore, may be rightfully held responsible for such a knowledge of the law asis common to men in general, having no greater natural capacities than himself,and no greater opportunities for learning the law. And he can rightfully be heldto no greater knowledge of the law than this. To hold him responsible for agreater knowledge of the law than is common to mankind, when other things areequal, would be gross injustice and cruelty. The mass of mankind can give butlittle of their attention to acquiring a knowledge of the law. Their otherduties in life forbid it. Of course, they cannot investigate abstruse ordifficult questions. All that can rightfully be required of each of them, then,is that he exercise such a candid and conscientious judgment as it is common formankind generally to exercise in such matters. If he have done this, it would bemonstrous to punish him criminally for his errors; errors not of conscience, butonly of judgment. It would also be contrary to the first principles of a freegovernment (that is, a government formed by voluntary association) to punish menin such cases, because it would be absurd to suppose that any man wouldvoluntarily assist to establish or support a government that would punishhimself for acts which he himself did not know to be crimes. But a man mayreasonably unite with his fellow-men to maintain a government to punish thoseacts which he himself considers criminal, and may reasonably acquiesce in hisown liability to be punished for such acts. As those are the only grounds onwhich any one can be supposed to render any voluntary support to a government,it follows that a government formed by voluntary association, and of coursehaving no powers except such as all the associates have consented that it mayhave, can have no power to punish a man for acts which he did not himself knowto be criminal.The safety of society, which is the only object of the criminal law, requiresonly that those acts which are understood by mankind at large to beintrinsically criminal, should be punished as crimes. The remaining few (ifthere are any) may safely be left to go unpunished. Nor does the safety ofsociety require that any individuals, other than those who have sufficientmental capacity to understand that their acts are criminal, should be criminallypunished. All others may safely be left to their liability, under the civil law,to compensate for their unintentional wrongs.The only real object of this absurd and atrocious doctrine, that “ignorance ofthe law (that is, of crime) excuses no one,” and that “everyone is bound to knowthe criminal law,” (that is, bound to know what is a crime,) is to maintain anentirely arbitrary authority on the part of the government, and to deny to thepeople all right to judge for themselves what their own rights and libertiesare. In other words, the whole object of the doctrine is to deny to the peoplethemselves all right to judge what statutes and other acts of the government areconsistent or inconsistent with their own rights and liberties; and thus toreduce the people to the condition of mere slaves to a despotic power, such asthe people themselves would never have voluntarily established, and the justiceof whose laws the people themselves cannot understand.Under the true trial by jury all tyranny of this kind would be abolished. A jurywould not only judge what acts were really criminal, but they would judge of themental capacity of an accused person, and of his opportunities for understandingthe true character of his conduct. In short, they would judge of his moralintent from all the circumstances of the case, and acquit him, if they had anyreasonable doubt that he knew that he was committing a crime.[2]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] This presumption, founded upon age alone, is as absurd in civil matters asin criminal. What can be more entirely ludicrous than the idea that all men (notmanifestly imbecile) become mentally competent to make all contracts whatsoeveron the day they become twenty-one years of age?—and that, previous to that day,no man becomes competent to make any contract whatever, except for the presentsupply of the most obvious wants of nature 1 In reason, a man’s legal competencyto make bind-ing contracts, in any and every case whatever, depends wholly uponhis mental capacity to make reasonable contracts in each particular case. It ofcourse requires more capacity to make a reasonable contract in some cases thanin others. It requires, for example, more capacity to make a reasonable contractin the purchase of a large estate, than in the purchase of a pair of shoes. Butthe mental capacity to make a reasonable contract, in any particular case, is,in reason, the only legal criterion of the legal competency to make a bindingcontract in that case. The age, whether more or less than twenty-one years, isof no legal consequence whatever, except that it is entitled to someconsideration as evidence of capacity.It may be mentioned, in this connection, that the rules that prevail, that everyman is entitled to freedom from parental authority at twenty-one years of age,and no one before that age, are of the same class of absurdities with those thathave been mentioned. The only ground on which a parent is ever entitled toexercise authority over his child, is that the child is incapable of takingreasonable care of himself. The child would be entitled to his freedom from hisbirth, if he were at that time capable of taking reasonable care of himself.Some become capable of taking care of themselves at an earlier age than others.And whenever any one becomes capable of taking reasonable care of himself, andnot until then, he is entitled to his freedom, be his age more or less.These principles would prevail under the true trial by jury, the jury being thejudges of the capacity of every individual whose capacity should be called inquestion.[2] In contrast to the doctrines of the text, it may be proper to present moredistinctly the doctrines that are maintained by judges, and that prevail incourts of justice.Of course, no judge, either of the present day, or perhaps within the last fivehundred years, has admitted the right of a jury to judge of the justice of alaw, or to hold any law invalid for its injustice. Every judge asserts the powerof the government to punish for acts that are intrinsically innocent. and whichtherefore involve or evince no criminal intent. To accommodate theadministration of law to this principle, all judges, so far as I am aware, holdit to be unnecessary that an indictment should charge, or that a jury shouldfind, that an act was done with a criminal intent, except in those cases wherethe act is malum in se,—criminal in itself. In all other cases, so far as I amaware, they hold it sufficient that the indictment charge, and consequently thatthe jury find, simply that the act was done “contrary to the form of the statutein such case made and provided;” in other words, contrary to the orders of thegovernment.All these doctrines prevail universally among judges, and are, I think,uniformly practised upon in courts of justice; and they plainly involve the mostabsolute despotism on the part of the government.But there is still another doctrine that extensively, and perhaps mostgenerally, prevails in practice, although judges are not agreed in regard to itssoundness. It is this: that it is not even necessary that the jury should see orknow, for themselves, what the law is that is charged to have been violated; norto see or know, for themselves, that the act charged was in violation of any lawwhatever;—but that it is sufficient that they be simply told by the judge thatany act whatever, charged in an indictment, is in violation of law, and thatthey are then bound blindly to receive the declaration as true, and convict aman accordingly, if they find that he has done the act charged.This doctrine is adopted by many among the most eminent judges, and the reasonsfor it are thus given by Lord Mansfield:> “They (the jury) do not know, and are not presumed to know, the law. They are> not sworn to decide the law;[2a] they are not required to do it. . . The jury> ought not to assume the jurisdiction of law. They do not know, and are not> presumed to know, anything of the matter. They do not understand the language> in which it is conceived, or the meaning of the terms. They have no rule to go> by but their passions and wishes.”—3 Term Rep., 428, note.What is this but saying that the people, who are supposed to be represented injuries, and who institute and support the government, (of course for theprotection of their own rights and liberties, as they understand them, forplainly no other motive can be attributed to them,) are really the slaves of adespotic power, whose arbitrary commands even they are not supposed competent tounderstand, but for the transgression of which they are nevertheless to bepunished as criminals?This is plainly the sum of the doctrine, because the jury are the peers (equals)of the accused, and are therefore supposed to know the law as well as he does,and as well as it is known by the people at large. If they (the jury) are notpresumed to know the law, neither the accused nor the people at large can bepresumed to know it. Hence, it follows that one principle of the true trial byjury is, that no accused person shall be held responsible for any other orgreater knowledge of the law than is common to his political equals, who willgenerally be men of nearly similar condition in life. But the doctrine ofMansfield is, that the body of the people, from whom jurors are taken, areresponsible to a law, which it is agreed they cannot understand. What is thisbut despotism?—and not merely despotism, but insult and oppression of theintensest kind?This doctrine of Mansfield is the doctrine of all who deny the right of juriesto judge of the law, although all may not choose to express it in so blunt andunambiguous terms. But the doctrine evidently admits of no other interpretationor defence.[2a] This declaration of Mansfield, that juries in England “are not sworn todecide the law” in criminal cases, is a plain falsehood. They are sworn to trythe whole case at issue between the king and the prisoner, and that includes thelaw as well as the fact. See juror’s oath, page 86."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER X.MORAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR JURORS.The trial by jury must, if possible, be construed to be such that a man canrightfully sit in a jury, and unite with his fellows in giving judgment. But noman can rightfully do this, unless he hold in his own hand alone a veto upon anyjudgment or sentence whatever to be rendered by the jury against a defendant,which veto he must be permitted to use according to his own discretion andconscience, and not bound to use according to the dictation of eitherlegislatures or judges.The prevalent idea, that a juror may, at the mere dictation of a legislature ora judge, and without the concurrence of his own conscience or understanding,declare a man “guilty,” and thus in effect license the government to punish him;and that the legislature or the judge, and not himself, has in that case all themoral responsibility for the correctness of the principles on which the judgmentwas rendered, is one of the many gross impostures by which it could hardly havebeen supposed that any sane man could ever have been deluded, but whichgovernments have nevertheless succeeded in inducing the people at large toreceive and act upon.As amoral proposition, it is perfectly self-evident that, unless juries have allthe legal rights that have been claimed for them in the preceding chapters,—thatis, the rights of judging what the law is, whether the law be a just one, whatevidence is admissible, what weight the evidence is entitled to, whether an actwere done with a criminal intent, and the right also to limit the sentence, freeof all dictation from any quarter,—they have no moral right to sit in the trialat all, and cannot do so without making themselves accomplices in any injusticethat they may have reason to believe may result from their verdict. It is absurdto say that they have no moral responsibility for the use that may be made oftheir verdict by the government, when they have reason to suppose it will beused for purposes of injustice.It is, for instance, manifestly absurd to say that jurors have no moralresponsibility for the enforcement of an unjust law, when they consent to rendera verdict of guilty for the transgression of it; which verdict they know, orhave good reason to believe, will be used by the government as a justificationfor inflicting a penalty.It is absurd, also, to say that jurors have no moral responsibility for apunishment inflicted upon a man against law, when, at the dictation of a judgeas to what the law is, they have consented to render a verdict against their ownopinions of the law.It is absurd, too, to say that jurors have no moral responsibility for theconviction and punishment of an innocent man, when they consent to render averdict against him on the strength of evidence, or laws of evidence, dictatedto them by the court, if any evidence or laws of evidence have been excluded,which they (the jurors) think ought to have been admitted in his defence.It is absurd to say that jurors have no moral responsibility for rendering averdict of “guilty” against a man, for an act which he did not know to be acrime, and in the commission of which, therefore, he could have had no criminalintent, in obedience to the instructions of courts that “ignorance of the law(that is, of crime) excuses no one.”It is absurd, also, to say that jurors have no moral responsibility for anycruel or unreasonable sentence that may be inflicted even upon a guilty man,when they consent to render a verdict which they have reason to believe will beused by the government as a justification for the infliction of such sentence.The consequence is, that jurors must have the whole case in their hands, andjudge of law, evidence, and sentence, or they incur the moral responsibility ofaccomplices in any injustice which they have reason to believe will be done bythe government on the authority of their verdict.The same principles apply to civil cases as to criminal. If a jury consent, atthe dictation of the court, as to either law or evidence, to render a verdict,on the strength of which they have reason to believe that a man’s property willbe taken from him and given to another, against their own notions of justice,they make themselves morally responsible for the wrong.Every man, therefore, ought to refuse to sit in a jury, and to take the oath ofa juror, unless the form of the oath be such as to allow him to use his ownjudgment, on every part of the case, free of all dictation whatsoever, and tohold in his own hand a veto upon any verdict that can be rendered against adefendant, and any sentence that can be inflicted upon him, even if he beguilty.Of course, no man can rightfully take an oath as juror, to try a case “accordingto law,” (if by law be meant anything other than his own ideas of justice,) nor“according to the law and the evidence, as they shall be given him.” Nor can herightfully take an oath even to try a case “according to the evidence,” becausein all cases he may have good reason to believe that a party has been unable toproduce all the evidence legitimately entitled to be received. The only oathwhich it would seem that a man can rightfully take as juror, in either a civilor criminal case, is, that he “will try the case according to his conscience.”Of course, the form may admit of variation, but this should be the substance.Such, we have seen, were the ancient common law oaths."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI.AUTHORITY OF MAGNA CARTA.Probably no political compact between king and people was ever entered into in amanner to settle more authoritatively the fundamental law of a nation, than wasMagna Carta. Probably no people were ever more united and resolute in demandingfrom their king a definite and unambiguous acknowledgment of their rights andliberties, than were the English at that time. Probably no king was ever morecompletely stripped of all power to maintain his throne, and at the same timeresist the demands of his people, than was John on the 15th day of June, 1215.Probably no king every consented, more deliberately or explicitly, to hold histhrone subject to specific and enumerated limitations upon his power, than didJohn when he put his seal to the Great Charter of the Liberties of England. Andif any political compact between king and people was ever valid to settle theliberties of the people, or to limit the power of the crown, that compact is nowto be found in Magna Carta. If, therefore, the constitutional authority of MagnaCarta had rested solely upon the compact of John with his people, that authoritywould have been entitled to stand forever as the supreme law of the land, unlessrevoked by the will of the people themselves.But the authority of Magna Carta does not rest alone upon the compact with John.When, in the next year, (1216,) his son, Henry III., came to the throne, thecharter was ratified by him, and again in 1217, and again in 1225, insubstantially the same form, and especially without allowing any new powers,legislative, judicial, or executive, to the king or his judges, and withoutdetracting in the least from the powers of the jury. And from the latter date tothis, the charter has remained unchanged.In the course of two hundred years the charter was confirmed by Henry and hissuccessors more than thirty times. And although they were guilty of numerous andalmost continual breaches of it, and were constantly seeking to evade it, yetsuch were the spirit, vigilance and courage of the nation, that the kings heldtheir thrones only on the condition of their renewed and solemn promises ofobservance. And it was not until 1429, (as will be more fully shown hereafter,)when a truce between themselves, and a formal combination against the mass ofthe people, had been entered into, by the king, the nobility, and the “fortyshilling freeholders,” (a class whom Mackintosh designates as “a few freeholdersthen accounted wealthy,”[1]) by the exclusion of all others than suchfreeholders from all voice in the election of knights to represent the countiesin the House of Commons, that a repetition of these confirmations of Magna Cartaceased to be demanded and obtained.[2]The terms and the formalities of some of these “confirmations” make them worthyof insertion at length.Hume thus describes one which took place in the 38th year of Henry III. (1253):> “But as they (the barons) had experienced his (the king’s) frequent breach of> promise, they required that he should ratify the Great Charter in a manner> still more authentic and solemn than any which he had hitherto employed. All> the prelates and abbots were assembled. They held burning tapers in their> hands. The Great Charter was read before them. They denounced the sentence of> excommunication against every one who should thenceforth violate that> fundamental law. They threw their tapers on the ground, and exclaimed, May the> soul of every one who incurs this sentence so stink and corrupt in hell! The> king bore a part in this ceremony, and subjoined, ‘So help me God! I will keep> all these articles inviolate, as I am a man, as I am a Christian, as I am a> knight, and as I am a king crowned and anointed.’”—Hume, ch. 12.

Ruffhead’s Statutes, vol. 1, p. 20.One of the Confirmations of the Charters, by Edward I., was by statute, in the25th year of his reign, (1297,) in the following terms. The statute is usuallyentitled “Confirmatio Cartarum,” (Confirmation of the Charters.)> Ch. 1. “Edward, by the Grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, and> Duke of Guyan, To all those that these presents shall hear or see, Greeting.> Know ye, that We, to the honor of God, and of Holy Church, and to the profit> of our Realm, have granted, for us and our heirs, that the Charier of> Liberties, and the Charter of the Forest, which were made by common assent of> all the Realm, in the time of King Henry our Father, shall be kept in every> point without breach.

Statutes of the Realm, vol. 1,> p. 123.It is unnecessary to repeat the terms of the various confirmations, most ofwhich were less formal than those that have been given, though of course equallyauthoritative. Most of them are brief, and in the form of a simple statute, orpromise, to the effect that “The Great Charter, and the Charter of the Forest,shall be firmly kept and maintained in all points.” They are to be found printedwith the other statutes of the realm. One of them, after having “again granted,renewed and confirmed” the charters, requires as follows:> “That the Charters be delivered to every sheriff of England under the king’s> seal, to be read four times in the year before the people in the full county,”> (that is, at the county court,) “that is, to wit, the next county (court)> after the feast of Saint Michael, and the next county (court) after Christmas,> and at the next county (court) after Easter, and at the next county (court)> after the feast of Saint John,”—28 Edward I., ch. 1, (1300.)> Lingard says, “The Charter was ratified four times by Henry III., twice by> Edward I., fifteen times by Edward III., seven times by Richard II., six times> by Henry IV., and once by Henry V.;” making thirty-five times in all.—3> Lingard, 50, note, Philad. ed.Coke says Magna Carta was confirmed thirty-two times.—Preface to 2 Inst., p. 6.> Lingard calls these “thirty-five successive ratifications” of the charter, “a> sufficient proof how much its provisions were abhorred by the sovereign, and> how highly they were prized by the nation.”—3 Lingard, 50.> Mackintosh says, “For almost five centuries (that is, until 1688) it (Magna> Carta) was appealed to as the decisive authority on behalf of the people,> though commonly so far only as the necessities of each case> demanded.”—Mackintosh’s Hist. of Eng. ch. 3. 45 Lardner’s Cab. Cyc., 221.Coke, who has labored so hard to overthrow the most vital principles of MagnaCarta, and who, therefore, ought to be considered good authority when he speaksin its favor,[3] says:> “It is called Magna Carta, not that it is great in quantity, for there be many> voluminous charters commonly passed, specially in these later times, longer> than this is; nor comparatively in respect that it is greater than Charta de> Foresta, but in respect of the great importance and weightiness of the matter,> as hereafter shall appear; and likewise for the same cause Charta de Foresta;> and both of them are called Magnæ Chartæ Libertatum Angliæ, (The Great> Charters of the Liberties of England.) . .> > “And it is also called Charta Libertatum regni, (Charter of the Liberties of> the kingdom;) and upon great reason it is so called of the effect, quia liber> os facit, (because it makes men free.)

This historywould show that Magna Carta, although continually violated and evaded, was stillacknowledged as law by the government, and was held up by the people as thegreat standard and proof of their rights and liberties. It would show also thatthe judicial tribunals, whenever it suited their purposes to do so, were in thehabit of referring to Magna Carta as authority, in the same manner, and with thesame real or pretended veneration, with which American courts now refer to theconstitution of the United States, or the constitutions of the states. And, whatis equally to the point, it would show that these same tribunals, the mere toolsof kings and parliaments, would resort to the same artifices of assumption,precedent, construction, and false interpretation, to evade the requirements ofMagna Carta, and to emasculate it of all its power for the preservation ofliberty, that are resorted to by American courts to accomplish the same work onour American constitutions.I take it for granted, therefore, that if the authority of Magna Carta hadrested simply upon its character as a compact between the king and the people,it would have been forever binding upon the king, (that is, upon the government,for the king was the government,) in his legislative, judicial, and executivecharacter; and that there was no constitutional possibility of his escaping fromits restraints, unless the people themselves should freely discharge him fromthem.But the authority of Magna Carta does not rest, either wholly or mainly, uponits character as a compact. For centuries before the charter was granted, itsmain principles constituted “the Law of the Land,”—the fundamental andconstitutional law of the realm, which the kings were sworn to maintain. And theprincipal benefit of the charter was, that it contained a written descriptionand acknowledgment, by the king himself, of what the constitutional law of thekingdom was, which his coronation oath bound him to observe. Previous to MagnaCarta, this constitutional law rested mainly in precedents, customs, and thememories of the people. And if the king could but make one innovation upon thislaw, without arousing resistance, and being compelled to retreat from hisusurpation, he would cite that innovation as a precedent for another act of thesame kind; next, assert a custom; and, finally, raise a controversy as to whatthe Law of the Land really was. The great object of the barons and people, indemanding from the king a written description and acknowledgment of the Law ofthe Land, was to put an end to all disputes of this kind, and to put it out ofthe power of the king to plead any misunderstanding of the constitutional law ofthe kingdom. And the charter, no doubt, accomplished very much in this way.After Magna Carta, it required much more audacity, cunning, or strength, on thepart of the king, than it had before, to invade the people’s liberties withimpunity. Still, Magna Carta, like all other written constitutions, provedinadequate to the full accomplishment of its purpose; for when did a parchmentever have power adequately to restrain a government, that had either cunning toevade its requirements, or strength to overcome those who attempted its defence?The work of usurpation, therefore, though seriously checked, still went on, to agreat extent, after Magna Carta. Innovations upon the Law of the Land are stillmade by the government. One innovation was cited as a precedent; precedents madecustoms; and customs became laws, so far as practice was concerned; until thegovernment, composed of the king, the high functionaries of the church, thenobility, a House of Commons representing the “forty shilling freeholders,” anda dependent and servile judiciary, all acting in conspiracy against the mass ofthe people, became practically absolute, as it is at this day.As proof that Magna Carta embraced little else than what was previouslyrecognized as the common law, or Law of the Land, I repeat some authorities thathave been already cited.> Crabbe says, “It is admitted on all hands that it (Magna Carta) contains> nothing but what was confirmatory of the common law and the ancient usages of> the realm; and is, properly speaking, only an enlargement of the charter of> Henry I. and his successors.”—Crabbe’s Hist. of the Eng. Law, p. 127.> Blackstone says, “It is agreed by all our historians that the Great Charter of> King John was, for the most part, compiled from the ancient customs of the> realm, or the laws of Edward the Confessor: by which they mean the old common> law which was established under our Saxon princes.”—Blackstone’s Introd. to> the Charters. See Blackstone’s Law Tracts, Oxford ed., p. 289.> Coke says, “The common law is the most general and ancient law of the realm. .> . The common law appeareth in the statute of Magna Carta, and other ancient> statutes, (which for the most part are affirmations of the common law,) in the> original writs, in judicial records, and in our books of terms and years.”—1> Inst., 115 b.> Coke also says, “It (Magna Carta) was for the most part declaratory of the> principal grounds of the fundamental laws of England, and for the residue it> was additional to supply some defects of the common law. . . They (Magna Carta> and Carta de Foresta) were, for the most part, but declarations of the ancient> common laws of England, to the observation and keeping whereof the king was> bound and sworn.”—Preface to 2 Inst., p. 3 and 5.> Hume says, “We may now, from the tenor of this charter, (Magna Carta,)> conjecture what those laws were of King Edward, (the Confessor,) which the> English nation during so many generations still desired, with such an> obstinate perseverance, to have recalled and established. They were chiefly> these latter articles of Magna Carta; and the barons who, at the beginning of> these commotions, demanded the revival of the Saxon laws, undoubtedly thought> that they had sufficiently satisfied the people, by procuring them this> concession, which comprehended the principal objects to which they had so long> aspired.”—Hume, ch. 11.Edward the First confessed that the Great Charter was substantially identicalwith the common law, as far as it went, when he commanded his justices to allow“the Great Charter as the Common Law,” “in pleas before them, and in judgment,”as has been already cited in this chapter.—25 Edward I., ch. 1, (1297.)In conclusion of this chapter, it may be safely asserted that the veneration,attachment, and pride, which the English nation, for more than six centuries,have felt towards Magna Carta, are in their nature among the most irrefragableof all proofs that it was the fundamental law of the land, and constitutionallybinding upon the government; for, otherwise, it would have been, in their eyes,an unimportant and worthless thing. What those sentiments were I will use thewords of others to describe,—the words, too, of men, who, like all modernauthors who have written on the same topic, had utterly inadequate ideas of thetrue character of the instrument on which they lavished their eulogiums.Hume, speaking of the Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest, as they wereconfirmed by Henry III., in 1217, says:> “Thus these famous charters were brought nearly to the shape in which they> have ever since stood; and they were, during many generations, the peculiar> favorites of the English nation, and esteemed the most sacred rampart to> national liberty and independence. As they secured the rights of all orders of> men, they were anxiously defended by all, and became the basis, in a manner,> of the English monarchy, and a kind of original contract, which both limited> the authority of the king and ensured the conditional allegiance of his> subjects. Though often violated, they were still claimed by the nobility and> people; and, as no precedents were supposed valid that infringed them, they> rather acquired than lost authority, from the frequent attempts made against> them in several ages, by regal and arbitrary power.”—Hume, ch. 12.> Mackintosh says, “It was understood by the simplest of the unlettered age for> whom it was intended. It was remembered by them. . . For almost five centuries> it was appealed to as the decisive authority on behalf of the people. . . To> have produced it, to have preserved it, to have matured it, constitute the> immortal claim of England on the esteem of mankind. Her Bacons and> Shakspeares, her Miltons and Newtons, with all the truth which they have> revealed, and all the generous virtues which they have inspired, are of> inferior value when compared with the subjection of men and their rulers to> the principles of justice; if, indeed, it be not more true that these mighty> spirits could not have been formed except under equal laws, nor roused to full> activity without the influence of that spirit which the Great Charter breathed> over their forefathers.”—Mackintosh’s Hist. of Eng., ch. 3.[5]Of the Great Charter, the trial by jury is the vital part, and the only partthat places the liberties of the people in their own keeping. Of this Blackstonesays:> “The trial by jury, or the country, per patriam, is also that trial by the> peers of every Englishman, which, as the grand bulwark of his liberties, is> secured to him by the Great Charter; nullus liber homo capiatur, vel> imprisonetur, aut exuletur, aut aliquo modo destruatur, nisi per legale> judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terræ. . .> > The liberties of England cannot but subsist so long as this palladium remains> sacred and inviolate, not only from all open attacks, which none will be so> hardy as to make, but also from all secret machinations which may sap and> undermine it.”[6]> “The trial by jury ever has been, and I trust ever will be, looked upon as the> glory of the English law. . . It is the most transcendent privilege which any> subject can enjoy or wish for, that he cannot be affected in his property, his> liberty, or his person, but by the unanimous consent of twelve of his> neighbors and equals.”[7]> Hume calls the trial by jury “An institution admirable in itself, and the best> calculated for the preservation of liberty and the administration of justice,> that ever was devised by the wit of man.”[8]An old book, called “English Liberties,” says:> “English Parliaments have all along been most zealous for preserving this> great Jewel of Liberty, trials by juries having no less than fifty-eight> several times, since the Norman Conquest, been established and confirmed by> the legislative power, no one privilege besides having been ever so often> remembered in parliament.”[9]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] Mackintosh’s Hist. of Eng., ch. 3. 45 Lardner’s Cab. Cyc., 354.[2] “Forty shilling freeholders” were those “people dwelling and resident in thesame counties, whereof every one of them shall have free land or tenement to thevalue of forty shillings by the year at the least above all charges.” By statute8 Henry 6, oh. 7, (1429,) these freeholders only were allowed to vote formembers of Parliament from the counties.[3] He probably speaks in its favor only to blind the eyes of the people to thefrauds he has attempted upon its true meaning.[4] It will be noticed that Coke calls these confirmations of the charter “actsof parliament,” instead of acts of the king alone. This needs explanation.It was one of Coke’s ridiculous pretences, that laws anciently enacted by theking, at the request, or with the consent, or by the advice, of his parliament,was “an act of parliament,” instead of the act of the king. And in the extractscited, he carries this idea so far as to pretend that the various confirmationsof the Great Charter were “acts of parliament,” instead of the acts of thekings. He might as well have pretended that the original grant of the Charterwas an “act of parliament;” because it was not only granted at the request, andwith the consent, and by the advice, but on the compulsion even, of those whocommonly constituted his parliaments. Yet this did not make the grant of thecharter “an act of parliament.” It was simply an act of the king.The object of Coke, in this pretence, was to furnish some color for the palpablefalsehood that the legislative authority, which parliament was trying to assumein his own day, and which it finally succeeded in obtaining, had a precedent inthe ancient constitution of the kingdom.There would be as much reason in saying that, because the ancient kings were inthe habit of passing laws in special answer to the petitions of their subjects,therefore those petitioners were a part of the legislative power of the kingdom.One great objection to this argument of Coke, for the legislative authority ofthe ancient parliaments, is that a very large—probably much the larger—number oflegislative acts were done without the advice, consent, request, or evenpresence, of a parliament. Not only were many formal statutes passed without anymention of the consent or advice of parliament, but a simple order of the kingin council, or a simple proclamation, writ, or letter under seal, issued by hiscommand, had the same force as what Coke calls “an act of parliament.” And thispractice continued, to a considerable extent at least, down to Coke’s own time.The kings were always in the habit of consulting their parliaments, more orless, in regard to matters of legislation,—not because their consent wasconstitutionally necessary, but in order to make influence in favor of theirlaws, and thus induce the people to observe them, and the juries to enforcethem.The general duties of the ancient parliaments were not legislative, butjudicial, as will be shown more fully hereafter. The people were not representedin the parliaments at the time of Magna Carta, but only the archbishops,bishops, earls, barons, and knights; so that little or nothing would have beengained for liberty by Coke’s idea that parliament had a legislative power. Hewould only have substituted an aristocracy for a king. Even after the Commonswere represented in parliament, they for some centuries appeared only aspetitioners, except in the matter of taxation, when their consent was asked. Andalmost the only source of their influence on legislation was this: that theywould sometimes refuse their consent to the taxation, unless the king would passsuch laws as they petitioned for; or, as would seem to have been much morefrequently the case, unless he would abolish such laws and practices as theyremonstrated against.The influence or power of parliament, and especially of the Commons, in thegeneral legislation of the country, was a thing of slow growth, having itsorigin in a device of the king to get money contrary to law, (as will be seen inthe next volume,) and not at all a part of the constitution of the kingdom, norhaving its foundation in the consent of the people. The power, as at presentexercised, was not fully established until 1688, (near five hundred years afterMagna Carta,) when the House of Commons (falsely so called) had acquired suchinfluence as the representative, not of the people, but of the wealthy of thenation, that they compelled the king to discard the oath fixed by theconstitution of the kingdom; (which oath has been already given in a formerchapter,[4a] and was, in substance, to preserve and execute the Common Law, theLaw of the Land,—or, in the words of the oath, “the just laws and customs whichthe common people had chosen;”) and to swear that he would “govern the people ofthis kingdom of England, and the dominions thereto belonging, according to thestatutes in parliament agreed on, and the laws and customs of the same.”[4b]The passage and enforcement of this statute, and the assumption of this oath bythe king, were plain violations of the English constitution, inasmuch as theyabolished, so far as such an oath could abolish, the legislative power of theking, and also “those just laws and customs which the common people (throughtheir juries) had chosen,” and substituted the will of parliament in theirstead.Coke was a great advocate for the legislative power of parliament, as a means ofrestraining the power of the king. As he denied all power to juries to decideupon the obligation of laws, and as he held that the legislative power was “sotranscendent and absolute as (that) it cannot be confined, either for causes orpersons, within any bounds,”[4c] he was perhaps honest in holding that it wassafer to trust this terrific power in the hands of parliament, than in the handsof the king. His error consisted in holding that either the king or parliamenthad any such power, or that they had any power at all to pass laws that shouldbe binding upon a jury.These declarations of Coke, that the charter was confirmed by thirty-two “actsof parliament,” have a mischievous bearing in another respect. They tend toweaken the authority of the charter, by conveying the impression that thecharter itself might be abolished by “act of parliament.” Coke himself admitsthat it could not be revoked or rescinded by the king; for he says, “Allpretence of prerogative against Magna Carta is taken away.” (2 Inst., 36.)He knew perfectly well, and the whole English nation knew, that the king couldnot lawfully infringe Magna Carta. Magna Carta, therefore, made it impossiblethat absolute power could ever bo practically established in England, in thehands of the king. Hence, as Coke was an advocate for absolute power,—that is,for a legislative power “so transcendent and absolute as (that) it cannot beconfined, either for causes or persons, within any bounds,”—there was noalternative for him but to vest this absolute power in parliament. Had he notvested it in parliament, he would have been obliged to abjure it altogether, andto confess that the people, through their juries, had the right to judge of theobligation of all legislation whatsoever; in other words, that they had theright to confine the government within the limits of “those just laws andcustoms which the common people (acting as jurors) had chosen.” True to hisinstincts, as a judge, and as a tyrant, he assumed that this absolute power wasvested in the hands of parliament.But the truth was that, as by the English constitution parliament had noauthority at all for general legislation, it could no more confirm, than itcould abolish, Magna Carta.These thirty-two confirmations of Magna Carta, which Coke speaks of as “acts ofparliament,” were merely acts of the king. The parliaments, indeed, by refusingto grant him money, except on that condition, and otherwise, had contributed tooblige him to make the confirmations; just as they had helped to oblige him byarms to grant the charter in the first place. But the confirmations themselveswere nevertheless constitutionally, as well as formally, the acts of the kingalone.[4a] See page 101.[4b] St. 1 William and Mary, ch. 6, (1688.)[4c] 4 Inst., 36.[5] Under the head of “John.”[6] 4 Blackstone, 349–50.[7] 3 Blackstone, 379.[8] Hume, ch. 2.[9] Page 203, 5th edition, 1721."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XII.LIMITATIONS IMPOSED UPON THE MAJORITY BY THE TRIAL BY JURY.The principal objection, that will be made to the doctrine of this essay, is,that under it, a jury would paralyze the power of the majority, and veto alllegislation that was not in accordance with the will of the whole, or nearly thewhole, people.The answer to this objection is, that the limitation, which would be thusimposed upon the legislative power, (whether that power be vested in themajority, or minority, of the people,) is the crowning merit of the trial byjury. It has other merits; but, though important in themselves, they are utterlyinsignificant and worthless in comparison with this.It is this power of vetoing all partial and oppressive legislation, and ofrestricting the government to the maintenance of such laws as the whole, orsubstantially the whole, people are agreed in, that makes the trial by jury “thepalladium of liberty.” Without this power it would never have deserved thatname.The will, or the pretended will, of the majority, is the last lurking place oftyranny at the present day. The dogma, that certain individuals and familieshave a divine appointment to govern the rest of mankind, is fast giving place tothe one that the larger number have a right to govern the smaller; a dogma,which may, or may not, be less oppressive in its practical operation, but whichcertainly is no less false or tyrannical in principle, than the one it is sorapidly supplanting. Obviously there is nothing in the nature of majorities,that insures justice at their hands. They have the same passions as minorities,and they have no qualities whatever that should be expected to prevent them frompractising the same tyranny as minorities, if they think it will be for theirinterest to do so.There is no particle of truth in the notion that the majority have a right torule, or to exercise arbitrary power over, the minority, simply because theformer are more numerous than the latter. Two men have no more natural right torule one, than one has to rule two. Any single man, or any body of men, many orfew, have a natural right to maintain justice for themselves, and for any otherswho may need their assistance, against the injustice of any and all other men,without regard to their numbers; and majorities have no right to do any morethan this. The relative numbers of the opposing parties have nothing to do withthe question of right. And no more tyrannical principle was ever avowed, thanthat the will of the majority ought to have the force of law, without regard toits justice; or, what is the same thing, that the will of the majority oughtalways to be presumed to be in accordance with justice. Such a doctrine is onlyanother form of the doctrine that might makes right.When two men meet one upon the highway, or in the wilderness, have they a rightto dispose of his life, liberty, or property at their pleasure, simply becausethey are the more numerous party? Or is he bound to submit to lose his life,liberty, or property, if they demand it, merely because he is the less numerousparty? Or, because they are more numerous than he, is he bound to presume thatthey are governed only by superior wisdom, and the principles of justice, and byno selfish passion that can lead them to do him a wrong? Yet this is theprinciple, which it is claimed should govern men in all their civil relations toeach other. Mankind fall in company with each other on the highway or in thewilderness of life, and it is claimed that the more numerous party, simply byvirtue of their superior numbers, have the right arbitrarily to dispose of thelife, liberty, and property of the minority; and that the minority are bound, byreason of their inferior numbers, to practise abject submission, and consent tohold their natural rights,—any, all, or none, as the case may be,—at the merewill and pleasure of the majority; as if all a man’s natural rights expired, orwere suspended by the operation of a paramount law, the moment he came into thepresence of superior numbers.If such be the true nature of the relations men hold to each other in thisworld, it puts an end to all such things as crimes, unless they be perpetratedupon those who are equal or superior, in number, to the actors. All actscommitted against persons inferior in number to the aggressors, become but theexercise of rightful authority. And consistency with their own principlesrequires that all governments, founded on the will of the majority, shouldrecognize this plea as a sufficient justification for all crimes whatsoever.If it be said that the majority should be allowed to rule, not because they arestronger than the minority, but because their superior numbers furnish aprobability that they are in the right; one answer is, that the lives,liberties, and properties of men are too valuable to them, and the naturalpresumptions are too strong in their favor, to justify the destruction of themby their fellow-men on a mere balancing of probabilities, or on any groundwhatever short of certainty beyond a reasonable doubt. This last is the moralrule universally recognized to be binding upon single individuals. And in theforum of conscience the same rule is equally binding upon governments, forgovernments are mere associations of individuals. This is the rule on which thetrial by jury is based. And it is plainly the only rule that ought to induce aman to submit his rights to the adjudication of his fellow-men, or dissuade himfrom a forcible defence of them.Another answer is, that if two opposing parties could be supposed to have nopersonal interests or passions involved, to warp their judgments, or corrupttheir motives, the fact that one of the parties was more numerous than theother, (a fact that leaves the comparative intellectual competency of the twoparties entirely out of consideration,} might, perhaps, furnish a slight, but atbest only a very slight, probability that such party was on the side of justice.But when it is considered that the parties are liable to differ in theirintellectual capacities, and that one, or the other, or both, are undoubtedlyunder the influence of such passions as rivalry, hatred, avarice, andambition,—passions that are nearly certain to pervert their judgments, and verylikely to corrupt their motives,—all probabilities founded upon a mere numericalmajority, in one party, or the other, vanish at once; and the decision of themajority becomes, to all practical purposes, a mere decision of chance. And todispose of men’s properties, liberties, and lives, by the mere process ofenumerating such parties, is not only as palpable gambling as was everpractised, but it is also the most atrocious that was ever practised, except inmatters of government. And where government is instituted on this principle, (asin the United States, for example,) the nation is at once converted into onegreat gambling establishment; where all the rights of men are the stakes; a fewbold bad men throw the dice—(dice loaded with all the hopes, fears, interests,and passions which rage in the breasts of ambitious and desperate men,)—and allthe people, from the interests they have depending, become enlisted, excited,agitated, and generally corrupted, by the hazards of the game.The trial by jury disavows the majority principle altogether; and proceeds uponthe ground that every man should be presumed to be entitled to life, liberty,and such property as he has in his possession; and that the government shouldlay its hand upon none of them, (except for the purpose of bringing them beforea tribunal for adjudication,) unless it be first ascertained, beyond areasonable doubt, in every individual case, that justice requires it.To ascertain whether there be such reasonable doubt, it takes twelve men by lotfrom the whole body of mature men. If any of these twelve are proved to be underthe influence of any special interest or passion, that may either pervert theirjudgments, or corrupt their motives, they are set aside as unsuitable for theperformance of a duty requiring such absolute impartiality and integrity; andothers substituted in their stead. When the utmost practicable impartiality isattained on the part of the whole twelve, they are sworn to the observance ofjustice; and their unanimous concurrence is then held to be necessary to removethat reasonable doubt, which, unremoved, would forbid the government to lay itshand on its victim.Such is the caution which the trial by jury both practises and inculcates,against the violation of justice, on the part of the government, towards thehumblest individual, in the smallest matter affecting his civil rights, hisproperty, liberty, or life. And such is the contrast, which the trial by jurypresents, to that gambler’s and robber’s rule, that the majority have a right,by virtue of their superior numbers, and without regard to justice, to disposeat pleasure of the property and persons of all bodies of men less numerous thanthemselves.The difference, in short, between the two systems, is this. The trial by juryprotects person and property, inviolate to their possessors, from the hand ofthe law, unless justice, beyond a reasonable doubt, require them to be taken.The majority principle takes person and property from their possessors, at themere arbitrary will of a majority, who are liable and likely to be influenced,in taking them, by motives of oppression, avarice, and ambition.If the relative numbers of opposing parties afforded sufficient evidence of thecomparative justice of their claims, the government should carry the principleinto its courts of justice; and instead of referring controversies to impartialand disinterested men,—to judges and jurors, sworn to do justice, and boundpatiently to hear and weigh all the evidence and arguments that can be offeredon either side,—it should simply count the plaintiffs and defendants in eachcase, (where there were more than one of either,) and then give the case to themajority; after ample opportunity had been given to the plaintiffs anddefendants to reason with, flatter, cheat, threaten, and bribe each other, byway of inducing them to change sides. Such a process would be just as rationalin courts of justice, as in halls of legislation; for it is of no importance toa man, who has his rights taken from him, whether it be done by a legislativeenactment, or a judicial decision.In legislation, the people are all arranged as plaintiffs and defendants intheir own causes; (those who are in favor of a particular law, standing asplaintiffs, and those who are opposed to the same law, standing as defendants);and to allow these causes to be decided by majorities, is plainly as absurd asit would be to allow judicial decisions to be determined by the relative numberof plaintiffs and defendants.If this mode of decision were introduced into courts of justice, we should see aparallel, and only a parallel, to that system of legislation which we witnessdaily. We should see large bodies of men conspiring to bring perfectlygroundless suits, against other bodies of men, for large sums of money, and tocarry them by sheer force of numbers; just as we now continually see largebodies of men conspiring to carry, by mere force of numbers, some scheme oflegislation that will, directly or indirectly, take money out of other men’spockets, and put it into their own. And we should also see distinct bodies ofmen, parties in separate suits, combining and agreeing all to appear and becounted as plaintiffs or defendants in each other’s suits, for the purpose ofekeing out the necessary majority; just as we now see distinct bodies of men,interested in separate schemes of ambition or plunder, conspiring to carrythrough a batch of legislative enactments, that shall accomplish their severalpurposes.This system of combination and conspiracy would go on, until at length wholestates and a whole nation would become divided into two great litigatingparties, each party composed of several smaller bodies, having their separatesuits, but all confederating for the purpose of making up the necessary majorityin each case. The individuals composing each of these two great parties, wouldat length become so accustomed to acting together, and so well acquainted witheach others’ schemes, and so mutually dependent upon each others’ fidelity forsuccess, that they would become organized as permanent associations; boundtogether by that kind of honor that prevails among thieves; and pledged by alltheir interests, sympathies, and animosities, to mutual fidelity, and tounceasing hostility to their opponents; and exerting all their arts and alltheir resources of threats, injuries, promises, and bribes, to drive or seducefrom the other party enough to enable their own to retain or acquire such amajority as would be necessary to gain their own suits, and defeat the suits oftheir opponents. All the wealth and talent of the country would become enlistedin the service of these rival associations; and both would at length become socompact, so well organized, so powerful, and yet always so much in need ofrecruits, that a private person would be nearly or quite unable to obtainjustice in the most paltry suit with his neighbor, except on the condition ofjoining one of these great litigating associations, who would agree to carrythrough his cause, on condition of his assisting them to carry through all theothers, good and bad, which they had already undertaken. If he refused this,they would threaten to make a similar offer to his antagonist, and suffer theirwhole numbers to be counted against him.Now this picture is no caricature, but a true and honest likeness. And such asystem of administering justice, would be no more false, absurd, or atrocious,than that system of working by majorities, which seeks to accomplish, bylegislation, the same ends which, in the case supposed, would be accomplished byjudicial decisions.Again, the doctrine that the minority ought to submit to the will of themajority, proceeds, not upon the principle that government is formed byvoluntary association, and for an agreed purpose, on the part of all whocontribute to its support, but upon the presumption that all government must bepractically a state of war and plunder between opposing parties; and that, inorder to save blood, and prevent mutual extermination, the parties come to anagreement that they will count their respective numbers periodically, and theone party shall then be permitted quietly to rule and plunder, (restrained onlyby their own discretion,) and the other submit quietly to be ruled andplundered, until the time of the next enumeration.Such an agreement may possibly be wiser than unceasing and deadly conflict; itnevertheless partakes too much of the ludicrous to deserve to be seriouslyconsidered as an expedient for the maintenance of civil society. It wouldcertainly seem that mankind might agree upon a cessation of hostilities, uponmore rational and equitable terms than that of unconditional submission on thepart of the less numerous body. Unconditional submission is usually the last actof one who confesses himself subdued and enslaved. How any one ever came toimagine that condition to be one of freedom, has never been explained. And asfor the system being adapted to the maintenance of justice among men, it is amystery that any human mind could ever have been visited with an insanity wildenough to originate the idea.If it be said that other corporations, than governments, surrender their affairsinto the hands of the majority, the answer is, that they allow majorities todetermine only trifling matters, that are in their nature mere questions ofdiscretion, and where there is no natural presumption of justice or right on oneside rather than the other. They never surrender to the majority the power todispose of, or, what is practically the same thing, to determine, the rights ofany individual member. The rights of every member are determined by the writtencompact, to which all the members have voluntarily agreed.For example. A banking corporation allows a majority to determine such questionsof discretion as whether the note of A or of B shall be discounted; whethernotes shall be discounted on one, two, or six days in the week; how many hoursin a day their banking-house shall be kept open; how many clerks shall beemployed; what salaries they shall receive, and such like matters, which are intheir nature mere subjects of discretion, and where there are no naturalpresumptions of justice or right in favor of one course over the other. But nobanking corporation allows a majority, or any other number of its members lessthan the whole, to divert the funds of the corporation to any other purpose thanthe one to which every member of the corporation has legally agreed that theymay be devoted; nor to take the stock of one member and give it to another; norto distribute the dividends among the stockholders otherwise than to each onethe proportion which he has agreed to accept, and all the others have agreedthat he shall receive. Nor does any banking corporation allow a majority toimpose taxes upon the members for the payment of the corporate expenses, exceptin such proportions as every member has consented that they may be imposed. Allthese questions, involving the rights of the members as against each other, arefixed by the articles of the association,—that is, by the agreement to whichevery member has personally assented.What is also specially to be noticed, and what constitutes a vital differencebetween the banking corporation and the political corporation, or government,is, that in case of controversy among the members of the banking corporation, asto the rights of any member, the question is determined, not by any number,either majority, or minority, of the corporation itself, but by persons out ofthe corporation; by twelve men acting as jurors, or by other tribunals ofjustice, of which no member of the corporation is allowed to be a part. But inthe case of the political corporation, controversies among the parties to it, asto the rights of individual members, must of necessity be settled by members ofthe corporation itself, because there are no persons out of the corporation towhom the question can be referred.Since, then, all questions as to the rights of the members of the politicalcorporation, must be determined by members of the corporation itself, the trialby jury says that no man’s rights,—neither his right to his life, his liberty,nor his property,—shall be determined by any such standard as the mere will andpleasure of majorities; but only by the unanimous verdict of a tribunal fairlyrepresenting the whole people,—that is, a tribunal of twelve men, taken atrandom from the whole body, and ascertained to be as impartial as the nature ofthe case will admit, and sworn to the observance of justice. Such is thedifference in the two kinds of corporations; and the custom of managing bymajorities the mere discretionary matters of business corporations, (themajority having no power to determine the rights of any member,) furnishes noanalogy to the practice, adopted by political corporations, of disposing of allthe rights of their members by the arbitrary will of majorities.But further. The doctrine that the majority have a right to rule, proceeds uponthe principle that minorities have no rights in the government; for certainlythe minority cannot be said to have any rights in a government, so long as themajority alone determine what their rights shall be. They hold everything, ornothing, as the case may be, at the mere will of the majority.It is indispensable to a “free government,” (in the political sense of thatterm,) that the minority, the weaker party, have a veto upon the acts of themajority. Political liberty is liberty for the weaker party in a nation. It isonly the weaker party that lose their liberties, when a government becomesoppressive. The stronger party, in all governments, are free by virtue of theirsuperior strength. They never oppress themselves.Legislation is the work of this stronger party; and if, in addition to the solepower of legislating, they have the sole power of determining what legislationshall be enforced, they have all power in their hands, and the weaker party arethe subjects of an absolute government.Unless the weaker party have a veto, either upon the making, or the enforcementof laws, they have no power whatever in the government, and can of course haveno liberties except such as the stronger party, in their arbitrary discretion,see fit to permit them to enjoy.In England and the United States, the trial by jury is the only institution thatgives the weaker party any veto upon the power of the stronger. Consequently itis the only institution, that gives them any effective voice in the government,or any guaranty against oppression.Suffrage, however free, is of no avail for this purpose; because the suffrage ofthe minority is overborne by the suffrage of the majority, and is thus renderedpowerless for purposes of legislation. The responsibility of officers can bemade of no avail, because they are responsible only to the majority. Theminority, therefore, are wholly without rights in the government, wholly at themercy of the majority, unless, through the trial by jury, they have a veto uponsuch legislation as they think unjust.Government is established for the protection of the weak against the strong.This is the principal, if not the sole, motive for the establishment of alllegitimate government. Laws, that are sufficient for the protection of theweaker party, are of course sufficient for the protection of the stronger party;because the strong can certainly need no more protection than the weak. It is,therefore, right that the weaker party should be represented in the tribunalwhich is finally to determine what legislation may be enforced; and that nolegislation shall be enforced against their consent. They being presumed to becompetent judges of what kind of legislation makes for their safety, and whatfor their injury, it must be presumed that any legislation, which they object toenforcing, tends to their oppression, and not to their security.There is still another reason why the weaker party, or the minority, should havea veto upon all legislation which they disapprove. That reason is, that that isthe only means by which the government can be kept within the limits of thecontract, compact, or constitution, by which the whole people agree to establishgovernment. If the majority were allowed to interpret the compact forthemselves, and enforce it according to their own interpretation, they would, ofcourse, make it authorize them to do whatever they wish to do.The theory of free government is that it is formed by the voluntary contract ofthe people individually with each other. This is the theory, (although it isnot, as it ought to be, the fact,) in all the governments in the United States,as also in the government of England. The theory assumes that each man, who is aparty to the government, and contributes to its support, has individually andfreely consented to it. Otherwise the government would have no right to tax himfor its support,—for taxation without consent is robbery. This theory, then,necessarily supposes that this government, which is formed by the free consentof all, has no powers except such as all the parties to it have individuallyagreed that it shall have; and especially that it has no power to pass any laws,except such as all the parties have agreed that it may pass.This theory supposes that there may be certain laws that will be beneficial toall,—so beneficial that all consent to be taxed for their maintenance. For themaintenance of these specific laws, in which all are interested, all associate.And they associate for the maintenance of those laws only, in which all areinterested. It would be absurd to suppose that all would associate, and consentto be taxed, for purposes which were beneficial only to a part; and especiallyfor purposes that were injurious to any. A government of the whole, therefore,can have no powers except such as all the parties consent that it may have. Itcan do nothing except what all have consented that it may do. And if any portionof the people,—no matter how large their number, if it be less than thewhole,—desire a government for any purposes other than those that are common toall, and desired by all, they must form a separate association for thosepurposes. They have no right,—by perverting this government of the whole, to theaccomplishment of purposes desired only by a part,—to compel any one tocontribute to purposes that are either useless or injurious to himself.Such being the principles on which the government is formed, the questionarises, how shall this government, when formed, be kept within the limits of thecontract by which it was established? How shall this government, instituted bythe whole people, agreed to by the whole people, supported by the contributionsof the whole people, be confined to the accomplishment of those purposes alone,which the whole people desire? How shall it be preserved from degenerating intoa mere government for the benefit of a part only of those who established, andwho support it? How shall it be prevented from even injuring a part of its ownmembers, for the aggrandizement of the rest? Its laws must be, (or at least noware,) passed, and most of its other acts performed, by mere agents.—agentschosen by a part of the people, and not by the whole. How can these agents berestrained from seeking their own interests, and the interests of those whoelected them, at the expense of the rights of the remainder of the people, bythe passage and enforcement of laws that shall be partial, unequal, and unjustin their operation? That is the great question. And the trial by jury answersit. And how does the trial by jury answer it? It answers it, as has already beenshown throughout this volume, by saying that these mere agents and attorneys,who are chosen by a part only of the people, and are liable to be influenced bypartial and unequal purposes, shall not have unlimited authority in theenactment and enforcement of laws; that they shall not exercise all thefunctions of government. It says that they shall never exercise that ultimatepower of compelling obedience to the laws by punishing for disobedience, or ofexecuting the laws against the person or property of any man, without firstgetting the consent of the people, through a tribunal that may fairly bepresumed to represent the whole, or substantially the whole, people. It saysthat if the power to make laws, and the power also to enforce them, werecommitted to these agents, they would have all power,—would be absolute mastersof the people, and could deprive them of their rights at pleasure. It says,therefore, that the people themselves will hold a veto upon the enforcement ofany and every law, which these agents may enact, and that whenever the occasionarises for them to give or withhold their consent,—inasmuch as the whole peoplecannot assemble, or devote the time and attention necessary to the investigationof each case,—twelve of their number shall be taken by lot, or otherwise atrandom, from the whole body; that they shall not be chosen by majorities, (thesame majorities that elected the agents who enacted the laws to be put inissue,) nor by any interested or suspected party; that they shall not beappointed by, or be in any way dependent upon, those who enacted the law; thattheir opinions, whether for or against the law that is in issue, shall not beinquired of beforehand; and that if these twelve men give their consent to theenforcement of the law, their consent shall stand for the consent of the whole.This is the mode, which the trial by jury provides, for keeping the governmentwithin the limits designed by the whole people, who have associated for itsestablishment. And it is the only mode, provided either by the English orAmerican constitutions, for the accomplishment of that object.But it will, perhaps, be said that if the minority can defeat the will of themajority, then the minority rule the majority. But this is not true in anyunjust sense. The minority enact no laws of their own. They simply refuse theirassent to such laws of the majority as they do not approve. The minority assumeno authority over the majority; they simply defend themselves. They do notinterfere with the right of the majority to seek their own happiness in theirown way, so long as they (the majority) do not interfere with the minority. Theyclaim simply not to be oppressed, and not to be compelled to assist in doinganything which they do not approve. They say to the majority, “We will unitewith you, if you desire it, for the accomplishment of all those purposes, inwhich we have a common interest with you. You can certainly expect us to donothing more. If you do not choose to associate with us on those terms, theremust be two separate associations. You must associate for the accomplishment ofyour purposes; we for the accomplishment of ours.”In this case, the minority assume no authority over the majority; they simplyrefuse to surrender their own liberties into the hands of the majority. Theypropose a union; but decline submission. The majority are still at liberty torefuse the connection, and to seek their own happiness in their own way, exceptthat they cannot be gratified in their desire to become absolute masters of theminority.But, it may be asked, how can the minority be trusted to enforce even suchlegislation as is equal and just? The answer is, that they are as reliable forthat purpose as are the majority; they are as much presumed to have associated,and are as likely to have associated, for that object, as are the majority; andthey have as much interest in such legislation as have the majority. They haveeven more interest in it; for, being the weaker party, they must rely on it fortheir security,—having no other security on which they can rely. Hence theirconsent to the establishment of government, and to the taxation required for itssupport, is presumed, (although it ought not to be presumed,) without anyexpress consent being given. This presumption of their consent to be taxed forthe maintenance of laws, would be absurd, if they could not themselves betrusted to act in good faith in enforcing those laws. And hence they cannot bepresumed to have consented to be taxed for the maintenance of any laws, exceptsuch as they are themselves ready to aid in enforcing. It is therefore unjust totax them, unless they are eligible to seats in a jury, with power to judge ofthe justice of the laws. Taxing them for the support of the laws, on theassumption that they are in favor of the laws, and at the same time refusingthem the right, as jurors, to judge of the justice of the laws, on theassumption that they are opposed to the laws, are flat contradictions.But, it will be asked, what motive have the majority, when they have all powerin their own hands, to submit their will to the veto of the minority?One answer is, that they have the motive of justice. It would be unjust tocompel the minority to contribute, by taxation, to the support of any laws whichthey did not approve.Another answer is, that if the stronger party wish to use their power only forpurposes of justice, they have no occasion to fear the veto of the weaker party;for the latter have as strong motives for the maintenance of just government, ashave the former.Another answer is, that if the stronger party use their power unjustly, theywill hold it by an uncertain tenure, especially in a community where knowledgeis diffused; for knowledge will enable the weaker party to make itself in timethe stronger party. It also enables the weaker party, even while it remains theweaker party, perpetually to annoy, alarm, and injure their oppressors. Unjustpower,—or rather power that is grossly unjust, and that is known to be so by theminority,—can be sustained only at the expense of standing armies, and all theother machinery of force; for the oppressed party are always ready to risk theirlives for purposes of vengeance, and the acquisition of their rights, wheneverthere is any tolerable chance of success. Peace, safety, and quiet for all, canbe enjoyed only under laws that obtain the consent of all. Hence tyrantsfrequently yield to the demands of justice from those weaker than themselves, asa means of buying peace and safety.Still another answer is, that those who are in the majority on one law, will bein the minority on another. All, therefore, need the benefit of the veto, atsome time or other, to protect themselves from injustice.That the limits, within which legislation would, by this process, be confined,would be exceedingly narrow, in comparison with those it at present occupies,there can be no doubt. All monopolies, all special privileges, all sumptuarylaws, all restraints upon any traffic, bargain, or contract, that was naturallylawful,[1] all restraints upon men’s natural rights, the whole catalogue of malaprohibita, and all taxation to which the taxed parties had not individually,severally, and freely consented, would be at an end; because all suchlegislation implies a violation of the rights of a greater or less minority.This minority would disregard, trample upon, or resist, the execution of suchlegislation, and then throw themselves upon a jury of the whole people forjustification and protection. In this way all legislation would be nullified,except the legislation of that general nature which impartially protected therights, and subserved the interests, of all. The only legislation that could besustained, would probably be such as tended directly to the maintenance ofjustice and liberty; such, for example, as should contribute to the enforcementof contracts, the protection of property, and the prevention and punishment ofacts intrinsically criminal. In short, government in practice would be broughtto the necessity of a strict adherence to natural law, and natural justice,instead of being, as it now is, a great battle, in which avarice and ambitionare constantly fighting for and obtaining advantages over the natural rights ofmankind.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] Such as restraints upon banking, upon the rates of interest, upon trafficwith foreigners, &c., &c."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX.TAXATION.It was a principle of the Common Law, as it is of the law of nature, and ofcommon sense, that no man can be taxed without his personal consent. The CommonLaw knew nothing of that system, which now prevails in England, of assuming aman’s own consent to be taxed, because some pretended representative, whom henever authorized to act for him, has taken it upon himself to consent that hemay be taxed. That is one of the many frauds on the Common Law, and the Englishconstitution, which have been introduced since Magna Carta. Having finallyestablished itself in England, it has been stupidly and servilely copied andsubmitted to in the United States.If the trial by jury were reëstablished, the Common Law principle of taxationwould be reëstablished with it; for it is not to be supposed that juries wouldenforce a tax upon an individual which he had never agreed to pay. Taxationwithout consent is as plainly robbery, when enforced against one man, as whenenforced against millions; and it is not to be imagined that juries could beblind to so self-evident a principle. Taking a man’s money without his consent,is also as much robbery, when it is done by millions of men, acting in concert,and calling themselves a government, as when it is done by a single individual,acting on his own responsibility, and calling himself a highwayman. Neither thenumbers engaged in the act, nor the different characters they assume as a coverfor the act, alter the nature of the act itself.If the government can take a man’s money without his consent, there is no limitto the additional tyranny it may practise upon him; for, with his money, it canhire soldiers to stand over him, keep him in subjection, plunder him atdiscretion, and kill him if he resists. And governments always will do this, asthey everywhere and always have done it, except where the Common Law principlehas been established. It is therefore a first principle, a very sine qua non ofpolitical freedom, that a man can be taxed only by his personal consent. And theestablishment of this principle, with trial by jury, insures freedom of course;because: 1. No man would pay his money unless he had first contracted for such agovernment as he was willing to support; and, 2. Unless the government then keptitself within the terms of its contract, juries would not enforce the payment ofthe tax. Besides, the agreement to be taxed would probably be entered into butfor a year at a time. If, in that year, the government proved itself eitherinefficient or tyrannical, to any serious degree, the contract would not berenewed.The dissatisfied parties, if sufficiently numerous for a new organization, wouldform themselves into a separate association for mutual protection. If notsufficiently numerous for that purpose, those who were conscientious wouldforego all governmental protection, rather than contribute to the support of agovernment which they deemed unjust.All legitimate government is a mutual insurance company, voluntarily agreed uponby the parties to it, for the protection of their rights against wrong-doers. Inits voluntary character it is precisely similar to an association for mutualprotection against fire or shipwreck. Before a man will join an association forthese latter purposes, and pay the premium for being insured, he will, if he bea man of sense, look at the articles of the association; see what the companypromises to do; what it is likely to do; and what are the rates of insurance. Ifhe be satisfied on all these points, he will become a member, pay his premiumfor a year, and then hold the company to its contract. If the conduct of thecompany prove unsatisfactory, he will let his policy expire at the end of theyear for which he has paid; will decline to pay any further premiums, and eitherseek insurance elsewhere, or take his own risk without any insurance. And as menact in the insurance of their ships and dwellings, they would act in theinsurance of their properties, liberties and lives, in the politicalassociation, or government.The political insurance company, or government, have no more right, in nature orreason, to assume a man’s consent to be protected by them, and to be taxed forthat protection, when he has given no actual consent, than a fire or marineinsurance company have to assume a man’s consent to be protected by them, and topay the premium, when his actual consent has never been given. To take a man’sproperty without his consent is robbery; and to assume his consent, where noactual consent is given, makes the taking none the less robbery. If it did, thehighwayman has the same right to assume a man’s consent to part with his purse,that any other man, or body of men, can have. And his assumption would afford asmuch moral justification for his robbery as does a like assumption, on the partof the government, for taking a man’s property without his consent. Thegovernment’s pretence of protecting him, as an equivalent for the taxation,affords no justification. It is for himself to decide whether he desires suchprotection as the government offers him. If he do not desire it, or do notbargain for it, the government has no more right than any other insurancecompany to impose it upon him, or make him pay for it.Trial by the country, and no taxation without consent, were the two pillars ofEnglish liberty, (when England had any liberty,) and the first principles of theCommon Law. They mutually sustain each other; and neither can stand without theother. Without both, no people have any guaranty for their freedom; with both,no people can be otherwise than free.[1]By what force, fraud, and conspiracy, on the part of kings, nobles, and “a fewwealthy freeholders,” these pillars have been prostrated in England, it isdesigned to show more fully in the next volume, if it should be necessary.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[1] Trial by the country, and no taxation without consent, mutually sustain eachother, and can be sustained only by each other, for these reasons: 1. Jurieswould refuse to enforce a tax against a man who had never agreed to pay it. Theywould also protect men in forcibly resisting the collection of taxes to whichthey had never consented. Otherwise the jurors would authorize the government totax themselves without their consent,—a thing which no jury would be likely todo. In these two ways, then, trial by the country would sustain the principle ofno taxation without consent. 2. On the other hand, the principle of no taxationwithout consent would sustain the trial by the country, because men in generalwould not consent to be taxed for the support of a government under which trialby the country was not secured. Thus these two principles mutually sustain eachother.But, if either of these principles were broken down, the other would fell withit, and for these reasons: 1. If trial by the country were broken down, theprinciple of no taxation without consent would fall with it, because thegovernment would then be able to tax the people without their consent, inasmuchas the legal tribunals would be mere tools of the government, and would enforcesuch taxation, and punish men for resisting such taxation, as the governmentordered. 2. On the other hand, if the principle of no taxation without consentwere broken down, trial by the country would fall with it, because thegovernment, if it could tax people without their consent, would, of course, takeenough of their money to enable it to employ all the force necessary forsustaining its own tribunals, (in the place of juries,) and carrying theirdecrees into execution."},{"pageContent":"logo [../Images/splash.png]http://Liberty.me/"}]
