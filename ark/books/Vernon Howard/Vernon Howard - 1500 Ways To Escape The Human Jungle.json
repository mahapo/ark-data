CHA PTER 7 SAVE YEARS O F SEARCH WITH THESE F ACTS A famous philosopher was asked by his s tudents, \"Wh y do we behave as we do?\" Holding up a clock, the teacher explained, \"It is like the inner works of this clock. Understand its hidden pa rts and y ou see why its exterior pa rts m ove as the y do.\" The lesson i s this: Se lf-knowled ge is the great power by which we compreh end and control our lives. And the power by which we save years of we ary search. Here are typical stag es in an individual' s progress toward the light. 1. At first, he is ind ifferent toward the truth, for his exciting daily activi ties keep him dis tracted from his an xiety. 2. A dawnin g awareness of his suffering causes him to seek help. 3. He is bewilde red and agitated b y the great number of or ganizations which claim to know the answe rs. 4. He falls into t heir trapping follies for a period of time, for he does not know what else to do. 5. Courag eousl y realiz ing that the y have nothing real to give him, he begins to search with in and to think for himself. 6. Hi s dev eloping consciousness le ads hi m to authentic teachin gs, perhaps in books or at lectures. 7.

L earn to love ne w and strange and unfamiliar conditions which for ce you to explore and discove r. 606. What blocks our as cent to the nex t higher level is the assumption t hat we ar e already up there. 607. What we imagine is our power is not powe r at all, while wh at we cannot imagin e -- Truth -- is our actual powe r. 608. You are not required to sacrifi ce an ything but imagin ations masquer ading as re alities. 609. One value of self- observation and self-knowled ge is to see who you are not . 610. Discov er who you are not, and y ou are not someone who has to prove who y ou are. 611.

See human nonsense as nonsense and save years of trying to make sense out of it. 615. There is no w ay to drop ha rmful nonsense as long as vanit y calls it wisdo m. 616. The question i s, how can we see that we do no t really know wh at we pr etend and insist we know ? 617. Anyone who sees he is merel y playing the role of self-command has a ch ance to reall y command. 618. What happens inside you, not ou tside, is what ne eds attention and examination. 619. Chang e the inner and you chan ge the outer , for the inner and outer are the same. 620. I t is a true miracle when a man finall y sees himself as his onl y oppos ition. HOW TO BR IGHTEN TOMORRO W 621. The guaranteed way to do better tomorrow is to do ever ything today consciousl y. 622.

There is no w ay to bre ak the ch ain of troubles without taking personal responsibi lity for them. 626. Do not try to unde rstand life with y our usual k inds of thoughts, for that i ncreases unde rstanding. 627. Seein g our helplessness is jus t fine as long as it means to see the uselessness of our usual wa ys. 628.

When unde rstanding another person 's problem you help hi m correctly, even thou gh ther e is no thing you can do about it. 630. The wise se eker uses discoura gement as a sign al to seek all the ha rder! 631. Trying to convinc e ourselves that we a re right pr events high er facts from making us right. 632. The only right start toward an understandin g of human natur e is an admission of a lack of pr esent understanding. 633. A sour apple tre e deceives only those who admire the blossoms withou t tastin g the fruit. 634. B y seein g human evil seriousl y in the right way we will finall y not take it seriousl y at all. 635.

When r eally knowin g who y ou are, you will finall y know the answe r to the question, \"What is truth ?\" 638.

Reall y know what y ou are like and you will really know what others a re like. SUFFERING IS A GIGANTIC HO AX 641. Try to see that suf fering is a g igantic hoax which cosmic f acts c an expo se. 642. The certain remed y for dull and repetitious da ys is to l ive from these esoteric wisdoms. 643. Right ans wers come when we ask our questions with right attitudes, such as a y earning to know . 644.

The intimidating tricks someon e plays on you are the same tricks he most fea rs might be played on him. 666. To be af raid of a host ile person makes as much sense as fe aring an angry ape in the zoo. 667. We find the light onl y after total defeat of our attemp ts to dec eive and outwi t it. 668. The qualit y of human life is rais ed ea ch time an individual refl ects, \"M aybe I am the problem.\" 669. The man who r eally sees his m istake today does not rep eat it to morrow . 670.

Any avoidan ce of person al darkness, no mat ter how noble it appe ars, is an avoidanc e of light. 677. Trash can be made to look like treasu re, but it can never be made to feel like tre asure. 678. A good memory of religious ideas is not the same as a good inner nature, but man y think s o. 679. He aring these ideas without actin g upon them is l ike buying an airplan e but leavin g it on the gr ound. 680.

I t will be answer ed by a high er powe r whose purpose is rescue. The bonfire was not prep ared or lighted by the res cuing ship. This was the task of the stranded sailors. B y doing their pa rt the y established cont act with what the y needed. Contact . That is the magic word. Any earnest man or woman c an start makin g conta ct with high er help by developin g right thoughts. One right thought is a willingness to abandon familiar and fixed belie fs.

CHA PTER 9 WHY THE HUMAN JUNGLE IS DANGE ROUS Some students of the inner life asked their ins tructor, \"Wh y does human ch aos continue in spi te of all efforts at corr ection ?\" Replied the te acher, \"Trying to so lve human problems with the same kind of mind that c auses them is l ike asking a destru ctive tornado to rebuild t he town it has just destro yed.\" The mind capable of curin g the human condition i s the mind that has risen above its own wron g ideas. How many human bein gs hav e risen above their cherished but wrong ideas? How many have even made the slight est ef fort to do so ? Not man y. Astonishingl y, most people fi ght fier cely to defend their false notions -- the very notions that cause their conflict and mi sery! It is like an ill man who locks the door when seein g the doctor appro ach with the healing medicine. That is why the human jungle is dang erous. And that is wh y you must aim to not l ive like most people. Where they fight fa cts you can welcome them. Where they wish to be i mpressive, y ou can wish to be r eal. Where they cling to self- defeating opinions, y ou can seek self- enlightenin g principles. Where they prefer bitterness over the past, you can choose libert y in the now . Let this chapte r exp lain clearl y why you should not l ive like most people. Then y ou will not cr y like most people. WHY THE HUMAN JUNG LE IS DANGEROUS 801. The world consists of imagin ary people cl aiming imagin ary virtues and suf fering from imagin ary happiness. 802.

A man p lants weeds instead of flowe rs bec ause his vanit y assumes it knows the difference in the two. 804. All ta lk about uplifting human conditions wi thout uplifting human nature is pure delusion. 805. People who love the human jun gle will make ev ery effort to prevent your escape from it. 806.
