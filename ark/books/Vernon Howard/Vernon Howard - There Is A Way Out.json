You see a brilliant star. If you lean to either left or right of your position you cut off sight of the star. We are teaching ourselves to stand in just the right cosmic posi- tion to see something higher than ourselves. Can you think of a more fascinating adventure?\" SELF-KNOWLEDGE \"I don't know the way out.\" *'Tou are the way out.\" \"I don't know what that means.\" \"Know yourself and you will know.\" WHOLENESS \"I wish to be whole, but am not sure what this means.\" \"Wholeness is the harmonious working of all the natu- ral parts of a man. This includes thoughts, feelings, physi- cal movements, sexual urges, action, speech, and so on. An obsession is the domination of one wild part over the other parts, as when sex dominates the mind or when im- pulsive emotions dictate violent action. Knowledge of all this is the beginning of self-wholeness and thus self-com- mand.\" 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"14 THERE IS A WAY OUT COSMIC SCIENCE 'Just what is this teaching?\" \"It can be accurately called Cosmic Science.\" \"In a practical way, what does it do?\" \"It keeps you from falling into trouble in the first place.\" \"That alone makes it worthwhile.\" STAGE PERFORMANCE \"What is human life like?\" \"Like a gigantic stage performance, which a story will illustrate. A group of children often played a game of dra- matics in which each portrayed a stage character. One played the role of an important person, another of a pro- found thinker, and so on. Then they grew up. Incredibly, they continued to play their roles, which they now took as realities. They went around acting as if they were impor- tant or profound. They felt depressed and angry when oth- er people did not accept their roles as real. They sensed that something was wrong, but did not know what it was.\" SELF HONESTY \"We all agree on the necessity of persistent self-honesty. Where might a beginner help himself?\" \"He can ask whether he really enjoys his life, or wheth- er he painfully endures it because he knows not what else to do.\" PRELIMINARY STAGE \"When first trying to find the way out I attended all kinds of meetings — religious, philosophical, and some quite weird. I finally realized something you have told us re- peatedly in this class. You said we find what we uncon- sciously wish to find. You know what I foolishly wished to find? Excitement and entertainment. Now I know better.\" \"That was a necessary preliminary stage.\""},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Powerful Facts About The Way Out 15 ATTENTION \"I have failed to become a financial success.\" \"Place your attention elsewhere.\" \"I fear that someone I love may leave me.\" \"Place your attention elsew^here.\" \"To what should I attend?\" \"To ways for rising above self-torture. Listen to me. I will show you how right attention can make you a king.\" SUNSHINE \"I hope my spirit is not too dark to learn.\" \"How you underestimate yourself! You always forget that while you are your own darkness you are also your own sunshine for ending the darkness.\" THE FIGHTING FOX \"I now see how I used to fight against my own libera- tion.\" \"Yes, the facts we fight the most are the very ones we need the most. This is one of the most incredible features of miserable man. He fights and fears the very medicine which could cure him.\" \"Why does he do this?\" \"It connects with his foolish defense of false positions. A fox fights when you get close to the stolen goods he is hiding in his den.\" THE STRANGE OBJECT \"It is true that we scorn that which we do not under- stand.\" \"A wind carried a man's hat deep into the woods where man had never visited. Gathering around the hat, the wild creatures tried to discover its use. A dove thought it was a nest, while a bear declared it to be a strange and huge berry. Every animal but one connected the hat with"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"16 THERE IS A WAY OUT his own personal needs and experiences. The exception was a wise owl who immediately identified the strange object as a hat. The owl explained that he had been in another part of the woods where creatures called men wore hats all the time. Never having heard of a man before, the crea- tures derided the owl and continued to be puzzled over the hat.\" WHAT IS NEEDED \"I know I need something but can never find it.\" \"How strange that you do not see what is so close.\" \"See what?\" \"That what you need is your own nature, liberated from illusions and pretenses.\" \"It is dawning on me that what I take as true and what is actually true are as far apart as earth and sun.\" FIRST LESSON \"I wish to enter your school of cosmic wisdom.\" \"Come back in three weeks.\" \"Here I am, three weeks later.\" \"Come back in six weeks.\" \"Here I am, six weeks later.\" \"You may now receive your second lesson.\" \"But what was my first?\" \"The ability to take rejection.\" YOUR LIFE \"I am caught between loyalty to my traditional beliefs and my urge to break out.\" \"Do not feel guilty about leaving the old. You owe nothing to illusions. Do not permit other slaves to keep you in chains. Your life belongs to you and you alone.\" \"But what should I accept and what should be rejected?\" \"You are never required to accept anything you have not seen or experienced for yourself.\""},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Powerful Facts About The Way Out 17 NEW READING HABITS \"Many interesting changes have occurred in my read- ing habits since attending these classes. Not only do I read completely different kinds of books, but I read in a new way.\" \"Yes, that always happens. Reading most books is like strolling idly down a country lane. No special thinking or feeling is required; you just follow wherever led. But esoter- ic reading is unique. It is like stepping off the country lane to explore unfamiliar ground. You must pause and look and examine. The customary country lane will lead you, but only unfamiliar ground can change you.\" PERMISSION \"Can you really help me?\" \"Will you really permit me?\" ASLEEP AND AWAKE \"I do not fully understand what it means to be spiritu- ally asleep or awake.\" \"To be asleep means to be the slave of anger and en- vy, to demand that events turn out according to personal desire, to deceive oneself and others, to suffer from guilt and shame, to take secret delight in hurting others, to live in fear. To be awake means to possess self-understanding, to have only one person within yourself, to see through the folly of worldly ambitions, to live from your real nature, to be free of all negative feelings, to be genuinely compas- sionate.\" CONDITIONING \"You seem to say we must leave our own intelligence behind when coming to these classes.\" \"Do not confuse intelligence with conditioning.\" \"Why can't we bring our acquired ideas?\" \"Can fire and water mix?\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"1 I 18 THERE IS A WAY OUT | LEAF OF TRUTH \"What should we do with an offered truth?\" \"Four men walked through the Forest of Truth togeth- er. A leaf bearing a sublime message fluttered down at their feet. The scholar said he would write a long book describing the shape and color of the leaf. The man who considered himself religious claimed that this was heaven's sign for him to go forth and save others. The angry man shouted his intention to fight the truth. But the fourth man merely read the message, nodded, and silently walked on. Nothing in him wanted to use the truth for personal prof- it.\" THE DIFFERENCE \"What is the difference between these teachings and ordinary systems?\" \"Ordinary systems condemn the driver as being evil because he bumped his car into a pole. These teachings say he bumped into the pole because he is spiritually asleep, psychologically unaware.\" \"But this does not mean that an individual is excused for his violent behavior.\" \"No. Any excuse for violence only promotes more vio- lence. No excuses are accepted.\" THE SHOP \"Society has thousands of plans for helping the helpless, but not much changes.\" \"Picture a shopkeeper standing in front of his shop and shouting to passersby about his delicious fruits and vege- tables. But the shop is empty. That is society. Only the in- dividual who has found himself has anything to give.\" FIXED BEHAVIOR \"I have a certain fear that I might lose my own indi- viduality by accepting these higher truths.\""},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Powerful Facts About The Way Out 19 \"Do you have individuality or do you merely have a fixed pattern of behavior which keeps you in conflict?\" \"I see what you mean. Sheep in a flock may have dif- ferent characteristics, but they are still sheep.\" \"If you could only see it, what you will lose is what a certain part of you yearns to lose.\" \"I will try to see it.\" INSPIRATION \"I wish to be inspired.\" \"Then realize that inspiration is not the same as stimu- lation. Stimulation is temporary excitement, usually caused by exterior events. It always swings over to depression.\" \"And what is true inspiration?\" \"A glimpse of truth hidden within you. It comes at first in a brief revelation, just as a flash of lightning il- luminates the scene for a split second.\" NEW VIEW! \"I don't know how to find the higher life.\" \"To win the higher give up the lower. The home of a man stood near a beautiful lake. Also on his property was an old and unused cabin which blocked the view of the lake from the home. The man took great pride in boasting to visitors about several famous men who had possibly spent a night in the cabin. At the same time he was sad- dened by his inability to see the rippling waters. He finally sacrificed his boasting by tearing down the cabin, which gave him a new view.\" FUN \"I want my life to be fun.\" \"So?\" \"Don't these studies tend to take away fun?\" \"Is your present life fun?\" \"No.\" \"Has it ever been fun?\" \"No.\" \"These studies are the only real fun on earth.\""},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 THERE IS A WAY OUT THE JOLT \"For many years I lived in smug self-satisfaction. Xo one could tell me anything. Then came the jolt I feared would come. My world fell apart.\"\" 'What in particular did this jolt reveal?'\" \"The number of things I was hiding from myself.\"' \"Yes. that is what must happen. You were jolted out of sleep, and now you are awakening.\"\" ' 'And about time. LEAP OUT OF DARKNESS \"You have told other members of this class about indi- vidual fears which block progress. May I know which fear keeps me back?\" \" \"The fear of appearing foolish. This includes both a fear of appearing foolish to yourself and to other people. You must therefore permit entrance of true ideas which may indeed make you look foolish. This is the only cure for both the fear and the feeling of foolishness. At first it appears like a terrible thing to do to yourself, but it is really a heroic leap out of darkness.\"\" THRILLED PEOPLE \"Please discuss right and wrong attitudes toward a man who really knows what he is talking about.\"\" \"A famous teacher once gave a lecture to some people who had neither seen nor heard him before. Many in the audience were thrilled at seeing such a renowned person. A few others were thrilled by what he talked about. It was these few people who went away with something unpos- sessed before. SE\\-EX KEYS \"I have seven keys in my hand, but do not know which one opens the door.\"\" \"Trv them.\"'"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Powerful Facts About The Way Out 21 \"But what if none of them work?\" \"That is the whole story of apprehensive man. He fears that nothing exists beyond his petty ways. Coura- geously experiment until identifying the six wrong keys. The remaining key will work but you cannot know this until eliminating the wrong keys.\" A SIMPLE FACT \\'Why do some events make me feel happy, while oth- ers bring sadness?\" \"Because some events seem to confirm false ideas you have about life, while others seem to deny them.\" \"Is it really as simple as that?\" \"As simple as that. However, you must prove this for yourself through daily experience. For instance, notice your disturbance when other people do not agree with your claims of being a successful person. This leads to a state which is above all events.\" IMITATION \"What prevents simple and natural living?\" \"Unconscious imitation. A nervous businessman was part of the madness of a large city. Wishing a calmer en- vironment, he moved to an unspoiled island in the tropics, inhabited by a few natives. But the businessman brought his nervous mind and manners with him. Believing that his agitation was a sign of normality, the natives eagerly imitated his jumpiness. After awhile, anyone who was not nervous was considered abnormal.\" TRUE BENEFITS \"How can I attain my true benefits?\" \"By discovering what they are.\" \"How is this accomplished?\" \"By seeing quite clearly that your present benefits can't keep you from crying.\""},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"22 THERE IS A WAY OUT TEACHINGS ''Who are these teachings for?\" ''For whoever knows that he does not know, for who- ever is secretly tired and perplexed, for whoever wants to be who he really is.\" \"Then they are for me.\" SUMMARY \"Your various summaries of the human situation have been very enlightening to us. May we have another one?\" \"Whether you are aware of it or not, you have chosen a certain way of life for yourself. You must therefore reap the results of that choice. If you wish to choose another way, you are free to do so, after which different results will appear. ' ' A MAN WHO HAS DARED '\"Please tell us something about a man who is truly awakened. \"Outwardly he may appear quite usual, but inwardly he is a sun for a dark world. He is a man who has dared to plunge all the way into himself until seeing things as they are in reality. He knows much more about everyone than he can tell, for few people are able to take it. He ex- ists only to those who can recognize him, to those who really want what he has to give.\" HOW IT GOES \"How does it go?\" \"A sincere student of the higher life came across a book of truth. His first reading aroused apprehension, for the book challenged his false assumptions. The second reading aroused interest, for something hard in him was beginning to melt. The third reading aroused inspiration, for he knew he had found a pure guide. The fourth reading aroused self- transformation, for printed truth blended with inner truth. That is how it goes.\""},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Powerful Facts About The Way Out 23 THE WHOLE POINT! \"I wish to get to the point.\" ''There exists another state of Hfe for you which is total- ly different from your present state. That is the whole point.\" OBEDIENCE \"Religion stresses the need for obedience, which has al- ways bothered me. Maybe it associates with my past in which I had to obey tyrannical authorities.\" ''Be cheerful about it. The problem will vanish once you grasp a certain fact. You must be obedient only to yourself, to your true and fundamental nature. That is the same as obedience to God and truth.\" \"I would have walked fifty miles in a storm to hear that single refreshment.\" SUPPLY \"I am confused. Can you help me?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then please give me what I want.\" \"I cannot supply what you want.\" \"But you said you could help.\" \"Ask me to supply what you need.\" THE RULES OF THE GAME \"We are caught in our own trap!\" \"Of course. Imagine yourself compelled to play a new kind of football game having numerous and complicated rules. The rules are so vague and contradictory you can- not even begin to understand and follow them. But in spite of that you are ordered to play the game, and when failing to play properly, you are punished! So man is caught in his own game, a game he neither comprehends nor con- trols. The game can never be anything but maddening, for its rules are based on illusions and on concealed self-inter-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"24 THERE IS A WAY OUT est. Liberty dawns for the man who finally sees that he him- self contributes to the riotous game.\" THE FEARFUL MAN \"I am guilty of many cruel acts. I am ashamed of myself. I am secretly hostile toward truth. I am afraid I won't make it. \" \"I have good news for you.\" HEAR THE TRUTH \"Am I capable of finding myself?\" \"Are you capable of hearing truth without resenting it?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Then you will resent truth. However, all is not lost. Hear the truth while resenting it, but make up your mind to have nothing more to do with self- destructive resent- ment. \"Part of me knows that this is the only sensible course.\" SEARCH FOR GOLD \"Something holds me back from seeking the way out, but I have no idea what it is.\" \"Two friends were disappointed with their lives. Also, they feared additional disappointment. They became inter- ested in searching for gold in a nearby mountain, so they read many books and studied maps. But on the day they were to head for the mountain, only one of them departed from home. This adventurous man had won a fine inner victory. He had determined to not let fear of disappoint- ment block his search for gold.\" PROFITABLE QUESTIONS \"Suppose a person wishes to ask only profitable ques- tions. What must he do?\" \"Ask all questions in a right spirit.\""},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Powerful Facts About The Way Out 25 USE YOUR ENERGY! ''All this seems to call for more energy than we may have.\" Pour every ounce of energy you have into your learn- ing. Have no fear of spending it lavishly. That does not diminish energy, in fact, spending creates more. Picking a plum from a tree does not decrease the plum-producing power of that tree.\" TWO DIRECTIONS \"Quite often we fail to benefit from the truth. Why?\" \"A cosmic fact offered to a man can be turned into one of two directions. It can be turned by the man himself into a gain or a loss. It is like tossing an apple to a hungry but confused man. Unless he recognizes the object as an apple he is likely to let it drop to the ground.\" ''As you said last week, recognition is everything.\" THE MISTAKEN MAP \"I am trying to reach Happy Hills.\" \"But you are on the road to the Valley of Despair.\" \"But my map says this is the road to Happy Hills.\" \"You need a thousand times more courage than you have.\" \"To do what?\" \"To tear up the map.\" SELF-REFERENCE \"We are told to abandon self- reference. I am not sure what it means.\" \"The false self imagines it is the center of the universe. A man lost a small coin in the street, which he mentioned to a passing policeman. A short time later some workers arrived with their heavy equipment and began tearing up the street to make room for new water pipes. Looking pleased, the man thanked the policeman for his all-out as- sistance. That is self-reference. \""},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"26 THERE IS A WAY OUT MEN WHO KNEW \"May we hear the names of men who really knew?\" \"Jesus and Buddha head the list. There are many oth- ers with varying degrees of cosmic consciousness, including Lao-tse, Plotinus, Saadi, Shankara, Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Al-Ghazzali, Epictetus, Chuang-tse. You can add Marcus Aurelius, Baruch Spinoza, William Law, Blaise Pascal, Leo Tolstoy, Arthur Schopenhauer, Ralph Waldo Emerson. ' ' \"Thank heaven for the few who broke through.\" ANGER \"Everyone is angry in one way or another, which is obviously self- destructive. How do these teachings help an angry person?\" \"He comes to these teachings with his suppressed anger. After awhile it appears that he is becoming less angry, but this is just a new role he is playing unconsciously — the role of being a non- angry person. Then through self- work he becomes openly angry to himself, that is, he becomes aware of how angry he always was. Now he is truly departing from anger.\" SWISS GIRL \"Speaking in general, what bothers us?\" \"What bothers us is where we are not. It is like the Swiss girl who was employed at a French seaside village having a lively tourist trade. Homesick, she told the other girls about it. They reminded her of the pleasant surround- ings and her good wages. She replied that her present lo- cation was beside the point. What bothered her, she said, was where she was not. We belong in a place other than the foreign psychic country we now inhabit.\" THE PRICE \"What is the price of this book of real knowledge?\""},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Powerful Facts About The Way Out 27 ''How many times a day do you get upset?\" \"Five or six times.\" \"To you it is worth any price.\" PERSONAL MIRACLE \"I have everything I need and yet have nothing I need. Do you understand my difficulty?\" \"What you need is a personal miracle. Risk losing what you call yourself and that miracle will happen.\" PERPLEXITY \"How did we get into this mess in the first place?\" \"A child was told by several adults to be good. Observ- ing the behavior of the adults, he concluded that goodness consisted of envy, ^sarcasm, and trickery.- Years later, as an adult himself, he was resentful and greatly perplexed. He wondered why a person as good as himself should at- tract so much unhappiness. \" \"That is a perfect summary of how we go wrong.\" DIFFERENT WORLD \"I am afraid I won't succeed in my attempts to become someone. \" \"You don't have to succeed at all. If you could see the full meaning of this you would live in a different world.\" METEORITES \"What prevents the saving truth from reaching man?\" \"Nothing but man's own resistance. Meteors provide the perfect illustration. Astronomers tell us that millions of meteors hurtle into the earth's atmosphere every day. Only a few succeed in penetrating this outer zone to land on earth. The rest are burned up by the atmosphere. The suc- cessful ones are called meteorites. Man surrounds himself with a psychological atmosphere of resistance and negativ- ity, thus preventing truth from reaching his innermost being. But the individual who welcomes a mental meteorite will feel a wonderful impact.\""},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"28 THERE IS A WAY OUT WHY ''Why is this way better than my usual way?\" ''Why is freedom better than imprisonment?\" ACCEPT YOURSELF \"I wish I could accept myself as my own rescue.\" \"Just do so. Imagine a factory producing a wide vari- ety of industrial products. Its manager sees a need for new- ness in the factory, so he uses the factory's own products to build a new and modern factory. Man has no idea of the marvels of himself. He is capable of starting right where he is to build a totally new nature.\" OUTSTANDING POINTS FROM CHAPTER 1 1.

If only we could build this awakened center.\" \"That is the whole idea. This right center resembles a man standing on a foggy hilltop at dawn. As the rising sun slowly dissolves the fog the man is able at first to sight nearby rocks and bushes. With more sunlight he sights dis- tant trees and slopes.

Become aware of mechanical reactions. Never enjoy self-pity. Do not be deceived by society's lofty but empty speeches. See that self-insight and self-change are the same thing. These are superb next steps. Find more for yourself.\" WRONG QUESTIONS \"Why do teachers decline to answer certain questions?\" \"Often because the question has no reality in it. Hyp- notized human beings wrongly assume their questions are perfectly logical and intelligent, never realizing that a faulty machine can only give out faulty products. For in- stance, a man might ask how to achieve worldly success. That is a wrong question. If that man became king of the world he would still be a slave to his own negative na- ture.\" TRUE INDIVIDUALITY \"How can we work for our real benefits?\" \"Imagine yourself standing in the middle of a stream. The flowing water tends to push you downstream. If you give in to the pressure you do what most people do, that is, you permit yourself to be carried downstream. You must be truly individualistic. You must not let a negative self or a negative society carry you away. Instead, go against the common social flow and work your way upstream. There are astonishing sights at the source of the stream.\" THE CHANCE \"Who has a chance to wake up?\" \"Whoever gives himself the chance.\" BE TEACHABLE \"How can we end self-defeating attitudes toward the truth?\" \"The next time you attend a truth-lecture observe the attitudes and words and facial expressions of the other"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"How to Perform Enriching Actions 31 listeners. Observe that man who is actually boasting about his weaknesses. See that woman whose face barely hides her fear and hostility toward the truth. Notice that person who is confused about the lecture, but who still makes an honest effort to understand. Now observe yourself. What are your attitudes? Be a teachable listener.\" PERSONAL HEALING \"It takes courage to speak the truth about the terrible human condition.\" \"It takes even more courage to speak the truth about one's inner and personal condition, but that is what heals the condition.\" \"May we discuss the details of this topic in a future class?\" THE BANK \"Why do these teachings emphasize individual contem- plation instead of attendance at religious or philosophical meetings?\" \"Because a poor man in a bank is still a poor man.\" \"So private contemplation is the sure way to inner wealth?\" \"Yes, and in that case a man's insight is tremendous. He knows at a glance whether the religious bank has real or counterfeit money.\" PEACH TREE \"It seems that we are absent when we should be pres- ent.\" \"Right. It can be illustrated by a young man who is given a fruitful peach tree by his father. The boy is told he must care for the tree, after which he can sell the peaches and keep the profit. But when the peaches ripen the boy is carelessly wandering around the noisy city, so the fruit is stolen by passing birds. Only as we value our lessons by remaining close to them can we collect the inner reward.\""},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"32 THERE IS A WAY OUT MAGIC MOMENT! ''What happens when an unaware person hears these facts for the first time?\" \"Something hits him but he doesn't know what. He is like a desert fox struck by rain for the first time. The new- ness of truth is so startUng he has no idea how he should react. This split second of suspended judgment is his great opportunity to change himself. Unfortunately, most hearers miss the magic moment. They instantly spill out with habitual and mechanical reactions that fill the empty palace with junk. They argue or reject or feel threatened or want to run away. Be different. Leave the mental palace empty. Watch what happens.\" CHALLENGE \"I feel challenged on every side.\" \"Challenge your own misconceptions about life. Re- main brave and steadfast when this challenge produces un- expected and uncomfortable results.\" \"But my challenges come from the outside.\" \"Never. They come from your own misconceptions. Follow my counsel and you will see that the inner and outer are the same, which frees you from challenges.\" HOW TO BEGIN \"How can I begin to wake up?\" \"Watch yourself in daily action. Just quietly observe whatever you do, say, think, feel. Neither condemn nor ap- prove what you see, but simply look at it without judg- ment. Mentally stand back a short distance from yourself and look at your daily actions, just as if you were casu- ally observing a stranger. One result will be the faint feel- ing that you are not at all the person you have taken yourself to be.

A businessman enjoyed working in his home garden, and when doing so was only a few yards from his phone. But there was no nearby door, so when the phone rang he had to rush around to a side door. After installing a door next to the garden he took the direct route. I will tell you about three direct routes. Instead of secretly enjoying conflict, give up its false pleasure. Rather than sacrifice yourself to others, live your own life. In place of blaming others for your unhappiness, see the cause within yourself.\" SELF-HARMING ACTIONS \"What about someone who complains that circum- stances and other people are out to hurt him?\" \"If he wants to stop getting hurt he must stop blaming anything and anyone outside of himself. He may not un- derstand this at first, but it must be done.\" \"What must he do?\" \"He must learn to recognize self-harming actions when he performs them. For example, he must not take pleasure in dominating others, and he must not sacrifice his men- tal integrity in order to gain material benefits.\" GOAL AND REWARD \"What is my goal?\" \"To find yourself.\" \"What is my reward?\" \"To be yourself.\""},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"34 THERE IS A WAY OUT EARNING A LIVING \"Suppose I earn my living by selling something, per- haps foods.

It is this fictitious person who demands con- trol over events, who argues, agonizes, and worries over competition. When the false self goes, so do all troubles go, for then you are One with the Cosmic Whole. Because you are unconcerned with results, you earn either a poor or rich living, but you are a free, sane, and happy human being. ENTER THE WATER \"Would it not be wise for me to remain at a distance from these ideas until I understand them better?\" \"There was once a man who declared he would not enter the water until he had learned how to swim.\" REFUSE TO COMPROMISE \"It seems that compromise is half our problem.\" \"A group of people were told about a rare fruit having a uniquely delicious taste. Wishing to possess this new fruit, the group visited various orchards to request it. The or- chardists had no knowledge of the fruit, but still tried to make a profit by offering familiar fruits as substitutes. Most people lazily accepted the substitutes. But one energet- ic woman refused to compromise. She continued her search until finding the rare fruit in an obscure orchard which few people ever visited.\" \"That is our mistake — we rarely venture beyond our- selves.\" ACTION FOR SELF-RESCUE \"You say we can use discomfort for self-rescue.

You will make everyone uncomfortable. Why? Because everyone feels trapped. Every man pretends and assumes he knows the difference between right and wrong, but his feelings tell a different story. Slumbering man is so sure he understands right and wrong, truth and falsehood, that he never even thinks about it. So this jolting test can be helpful to those who want to stop suffering from themselves, for they can now question their misleading assumptions.\" THE RIGHT PLACE! \"I wish to study cosmic science. Have I come to the right place?\" \"Why do you wish to study?\" \"Not to win public applause for my learning, but to straighten out my life.\" \"You have come to the right place.\" SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT \"Give us something to think about.\" \"It is really astonishing. A man will spend years study- ing and working on his business or employment, making it successful and efficient. Yet he will not spend five minutes studying the greatest business of all — his own life here on earth. ' ' \"You once explained this baffling behavior of man. You said that he rarely studies himself because he lives un- der the terrible illusion that he already knows what his life is all about. He trembles, fights, flees — and still insists he has self-command!\" TOY AND BOOK \"How can we outgrow useless and unnecessary involve- ments?\" \"A Dutch artist once painted a picture of a boy turning away from a dropped toy because a book on a table had attracted his interest. The artist was teaching how our child-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"36 THERE IS A WAY OUT ish toys fall away by themselves as we catch a glimpse of something higher.\" CONGRATULATIONS \"Your teachings first disturb and then please me.\" \"Congratulations. That is the right order. The distur- bance is caused by truth challenging falsehood. You are then pleased by sensing the healthy necessity of this. A per- son who is first pleased and then disturbed is getting false teachings. He is pleased at hearing what he prefers to hear, after which he becomes disturbed by realizing he is still the same miserable person.\" UNIQUE PROCEDURE \"In what way is this procedure unique?\" \"It begins by making you do things you don't want to do, such as seeing your real motives and going against hardened beliefs. It ends by letting you do whatever you want to do, for then you will never do anything harmful to yourself or others.\" DREAMING DRIFTERS \"You teach that right sight supplies right action. That is still unclear to me.\" \"You sail your boat down the stream. You sight an underground rock. That sight makes you guide the boat right. Do you know why most people bump one rock af- ter another? Because they are asleep in the boat, dream- ing they are in command.\" INTELLIGENT ACTION \"Will you please review what is meant by intelligent action?\" \"A man will ask for help in repairing his car or tele- vision set, but will he act as intelligently when his life needs repair? Rarely. Vanity refuses to admit the need for help. So vanity itself prevents the intelligent action by which he"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"How to Perform Enriching Actions 37 could escape psychic prison. The key to the cell is called receptivity. \" *'One fact is clear. We cannot afford vanity.\" AUTHENTICITY \"I want the authentic.\" \"Excellent. One speck of authenticity has more weight than a mountain of artificiality.\" ELEVATION \"How does spiritual elevation proceed?\" \"First you suffer from many things but do not know why. Then you suspect yourself as the cause of your troubles but are reluctant to admit it. Then you see how your unconscious cause produced the unhappy effect. Then you rise above cause and effect to the clear sky of aware- ness and peace.\" THE FOURTH MAN \"We are so easily distracted from our search!\" \"Lost in a jungle, four men decided to build one-man rafts for floating downstream to civilization. They began to search for suitable wood for the rafts. But one man, having heard rumors of buried treasure in the region, was soon looking for gold instead of wood. A second man also stopped his search for wood, for he foolishly believed that rescue would appear miraculously. The third man also stopped, preferring to spend his time in complaining and worrying. Only the fourth man kept to his aim. He built a raft which carried him to safety.\" THE HEALING OF HUMILIATION \"Why are we here in this class?\" \"To understand the invisible process by which our na- ture works. This insight enables us to let go, to permit the process to heal everything naturally.\" \"My friend left me. Can that ache be healed?\""},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"38 THERE IS A WAY OUT \"When he or she left you suffered from loneliness and humiliation. Examine the invisible process.

In- sight into the healing process is the very healing itself.\" RIGHT ACTION \"Sometimes I feel unwanted. What should I do?\" \"Nothing. \"Why do nothing?\" \"Because usual actions, such as seeking new friends, separate you from the feeling, and separation prevents in- sight. Can you even understand a torn coat while walking away from it? Habitual actions only suppress the feeling for a short time. Have you ever noticed the slight depres- sion that appears when the merry party ends?\" \"But what is right action?\" \"Total understanding is right action in itself.\" THE LETTER \"How can we give these facts the higher value they de- serve?\" \"Ask more questions, then value the answers. A teacher held a letter before his students, then asked them to estimate its value. When the students replied that the letter was of little worth, the teacher urged them to ask questions about it, which they did. The letter became valuable to the pupils when learning it had been written by America's honored poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\" LEARNING \"Starting today, I wish to find the way out.\" \"Then learn how to learn.\" \"I already know that.\" \"No, you know how to read and speak and think in a familiar way. Learning is quite another process.\" \"What is it?\""},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"How to Perform Enriching Actions 39 \"Studying with a preference for the new and unfamiUar over the old and comfortable.\" HOW TO LIVE CREATIVELY \"Please discuss creative living.\" \"It is living with a free mind and spirit. Creativity ap- pears of itself with the ending of wasteful practices. Life constantly renews itself, providing rich supplies every mo- ment, bu\" they are wasted. It is like a hungry man who takes one bite of dinner and throws the rest away. Look at all the energy wasted in petty annoyance. That energy could be used to win self-insight.\" \"Creativity appears of itself with the ending of waste. That is a new thought for me.\" CROSS OVER \"I cannot seem to cross over to the new land.\" \"Picture a boundary line which keeps you out of a wealthy country. The boundary consists of a fence and a ditch. If the fence is removed, is the boundary as formid- able as before?\" \"No.\" \"If the ditch is filled in, is the line erased completely?\" \"Yes.\" \"If you still could not cross, it would be because the boundary still exists in your mind. I inform you that the fence and ditch to the new land are no longer there. Cross over. HOW TO WIN \"No matter what I do I seem to lose.\" \"As long as you crave to win you will lose, even if you win.

Watch what happens.\"' HOW TO FIND A TRUE TEACHER \"What does a confused seeker need to know!^\" \"There are two main difficulties in fmding the way out, but both can be overcome. The first is the rarity of a teach- er who really knows the answers. The second is the inabil- ity and the unwillingness of a seeker to recognize a true teacher should they meet. A sheep cannot recognize an eagle. So fearing destruction of his false values at the hands of a teacher, the seeker rejects the very truth that could heal him. But if the seeker's pain becomes unbearable enough, one small and honest part of him can guide him to a teacher and make him receptive to the offered truth.\"' WHAT TO DO ' What must I do?\" You must love your liberation more than you love to criticize. \"You always get right to the point! I know there is no other way to make it.\" GARNETS \"Why do we fail to possess available truth?\" \"Imagine someone eager to search some rocky hills for semiprecious stones, the garnet in particular. But he is so eager to search the area he fails to prepare his mind. He arrives at the hills without knowledge of the nature of garnets.

One arrived several days earlier than the other. The slower mer- chant asked the speedy Arab for his secret. The swift trav- eler replied that he had traveled at night as much as he could, as well as day. The swift psychic traveler is one who has learned to use dark experiences for progress.\" f. NATURAL AGREEMENT • \"Last week you used the phrase natural agreement. May I know its meaning?\" \"Nothing is true unless a certain and deep part of your own nature agrees with it. Go by this rule and you will never go wrong.

Do you see the urgency of self- facing?\" ''Yes, and I am encouraged by knowing about it. The only way to escape the storm is to understand its nature.\" ACCURATE DIRECTIONS \"I need to hear accurate directions.\" \"They can be supplied by the truth within you, for truth speaks a language which is natural to your real self. A girl of ten was traveling with her American parents through a large foreign city. Becoming separated from her parents in the crowded streets, she lost her sense of direc- tion.

He wishes to show the way out to the few who want out.\" CONSCIOUS BUSINESSMAN \"Can these teachings help a busy businessman to re- main calm and efficient?\" ''They help anyone, anywhere, but take a businessman who has seen the light. To all outward appearances he may seem to be all wrapped up in commercial competition, but the man himself knows better. While one part of him con- ducts business, another part remains in detached command of everything. These two parts are not really divided, for a conscious man possesses self-unity. The two parts simply work together, like two hands. Free from concern over re- sults, the awakened businessman works calmly and effici- ently at earning his living.\" PROCRASTINATION \"Once in awhile I talk with people about the importance of self-knowledge. Most are procrastinators. They say they will explore the inner world as soon as a few pressing problems are solved.\" \"Procrastination is illogical from every viewpoint. It is like the man who wanted to cross the stream, so he sat on the bank to wait for all the water to run by.\" AN AWAKENED MAN \"If we were to meet an awakened man, could we recog- nize his superior state?\" \"You cannot credit a man with more insight than you yourself possess. You cannot see above your own level. Only a man who knows silver can credit another man with possessing real silver. Insight alone recognizes insight. So"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"54 THERE IS A WAY OUT an awakened man is never understood by sleeping men. His insight does not exist in their minds, therefore contact is impossible. You can now see why authentic teachers are mostly ignored or scorned. But all is well, for as you begin to awaken you can begin to recognize the few who offer authentic help. \" SELF \"I was once told to believe in myself. Is that possible?\" \"Who is this self you speak about?\" '^I don't know.\" \"Then you must be careful to not quote popular sayings without understanding them. If by your self you mean all the accumulated illusions you have about yourself it would be dangerous to believe in that. But if you mean your true and original nature it is a magnificent act to accept that nature.\" \"Thank you.\" WHAT BOTHERS PEOPLE \"The trouble is, we don't know what bothers us.\" \"A husband and wife enjoyed nature hikes. They usu- ally followed a trail that wandered through a short stretch of woods. One afternoon the same thought occurred to both of them. There was something unnatural about the woods they passed through so often. An investigation revealed what had bothered them. One large tree was foreign to the area; it did not belong there naturally. Apparently someone had transported and planted the strange tree many years earlier. You must see what is unnatural to you, such as strife and bitterness.\" ACCEPTANCE \"I wish to be accepted into your class.\" \"You must qualify by being very tired of something.\" \"Well, I am very tired of anxious self-defense.\" \"Accepted.\""},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Help and Guidance Toward The Way Out 55 INSINCERE INQUIRERS \"I have seen many inquirers depart empty-handed from a real teacher. Why does this happen?\" \"Because the inquirer is insincere, unready.\" \"Can the teacher recognize insincerity in an inquirer?\" \"Instantly. The pretentious inquirer gives himself away in dozens of vc^ays of which he is unaware. They include chattering instead of listening, a nervous need to interrupt, a veiled facial expression of contempt when told the truth, a wish to argue, an attempt to flatter the teacher.\" SHOCK AND SUFFERING \"Please discuss the wise use of shock and suffering.\" \"Imagine yourself standing over the bed of a deeply sleeping friend. In a quiet voice you inform him that his dog is digging up and ruining his garden. You urge him to wake up and call off the dog. Will he hear you? Not at all. His sleep is too deep. That is man's psychic condi- tion. He cannot even wake up when told it is for his own benefit to do so. Only a vigorous shaking will arouse him. Shock and suffering serve the purpose of awakening a sleeping man, but he must use the shock to run out into the garden, not to resent whoever wakes him up. ' ' GULLIBILITY \"I am afraid I am gullible. I will follow anything ex- citing or attractive all the way to the inevitable shock. What can I do?\" If a thousand people declare that a lemon is sweet, do you believe it?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because I know better from my own taste.\" \"Know that you can know everything from your own taste.\""},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"56 THERE IS A WAY OUT STUDY METHOD \"Please suggest a method for efficient study of these ideas.\" \"See how much attention you can give to one topic at a time. One day you might study the value of self-govern- ment. The next day you could examine the folly of living v^ith automatic assumptions. In time you will see connec- tions between ideas, for instance, you will see how indepen- dent thinking keeps you out of trouble in the first place. It is like studying an orange tree. By concentrating in turn on its fruit, its leaves, its roots, you see how they operate together to form the whole tree.\" EXCITEMENT \"I have been to fifteen teachers and not one of them has helped me.\" \"Do you want help or do you want the excitement of meeting new teachers?\" \"I see what you mean.\" FAMILIAR MELODY \"The melody of truth sometimes seems absent.\" \"The truth is always sending out its melody. Listen. Hear. Recognize! A musician lived in some hills where a homeland army was resisting the invasion of a barbaric country. Realizing he was surrounded by both friend and foe, the musician acted to help his countrymen who lost their way during nighttime battles. Opening the windows, the musician sat at his piano and played over and over a melody familiar to his own people, but not known by the invaders. Hearing and recognizing the tune the lost soldiers followed it all the way to the musician and to help.\" BENEFICIAL LOSS \"Some of the facts given in this class seem to threaten me with loss. I do not understand it but I do feel as if I might lose something.\""},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Help and Guidance Toward The Way Out 57 ''You are losing something, and should shout with joy over it. You still assume it is a loss of your self, when in fact it is a loss of the imaginary self which causes so much damage.\" \"This is a turning point for me.\" \"Yes, so make the most of it by losing the artificial self as soon as possible.\" INVITE UNDERSTANDING! \"Can God be known?\" \"Certainly. All you need do is to stop thinking about God.\" \"I fail to understand.\" \"God is not an idea. God as an idea produces thou- sands of gods, causing religious division and conflict, plus hypocrisy.\" \"But how can God be known?\" \"In this class you will learn how to think when neces- sary, and how to be above habitual thought. When not in thought you know God by being in Oneness with the All. Have patience. You will understand. Invite understanding.\" TRAVEL UPWARD \"Please give us whatever we need.\" \"You cannot explain with words those secrets which are above the level of words. Language is like the directory found on the first floor of a large office building. It can tell you what exists on the higher floors but it cannot carry you up there. After consulting the directory you must per- sonally travel upward. So every seeker must be careful here. He must not mistake knowledge of spiritual words for an actual and personal uplifting experience.\" SELF-DOUBT \"I am filled with self-doubt.\" \"Do not have the slightest hesitation in doubting every- thing you think and feel about yourself.\""},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"58 THERE IS A WAY OUT \"But doubt makes me feel uncomfortable.\" \"The road to self-certainty leads straight through the jungle of self-doubt.

' ' \"But this is how I have always lived.\" \"Which is why you have always been frustrated and re- sentful.' ' \"But why shouldn't results match my desires?\" \"Why should they?\" \"It is so hard to let go.\" \"Just let go. In spite of all your fear, nothing harmful can possibly happen to you.\" INTENSITY \"I would like to increase my intensity toward the inner adventure. ' ' \"Your level of intensity will be matched exactly by your level of understanding. Now reverse that statement. Your understanding will be equaled by your intensity. What hap- pens to the intensity of a medical scientist who senses he is finally on the right road to a new cure? It increases. Let more understanding arouse more intensity.\" COSMIC GOAL \"Help us stick to our lofty aims.\" \"Imagine a party of explorers in unknown territory.

Because of this they never set a goal of reaching"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Help and Guidance Toward The Way Out 59 the mountaintop from where they could view everything. That is man. He is so busy avoiding dangers to his faulty beliefs that he has no cosmic aim. Forget the so-called dangers. March toward your elevated view.\" WHAT MUST BE DONE \"Take anyone who has found the way out. What has he done that we have not done?\" \"He has risked rejection, not once or twice, but hun- dreds of times. This shattered his old nature, which made room for the new.\" \"And we have not risked rejection?\" \"No. You huddle fearfully in a corner. Try to see that what you really fear is the loss of false ideas about your- self. Now, in order to get out, what must you do?\" \"Risk rejection. HARBOR \"How can I reach harbor?\" \"By realizing that you are completely lost at sea.\" \"But I already know that.\" \"No, you try to feel secure by imagining what the har- bor looks like, or by picturing it as you would like it to be. You will reach harbor only when you have no precon- ceived ideas of what it looks like.\" AUTHENTIC ASSISTANCE \"Please comment on our search for authentic assis- tance.\" \"It is certainly right to seek help from a man who knows, but to lean on him is to miss your opportunity. The difficulty is that most people are unaware of how depen- dency triumphs over learning. But the path starts at an earlier point than this.

It can be illustra- ted by some Asian farmers who were trying to introduce several kinds of berries to their fields. A government expert urged them to visit an experimental farm where the berries were being grown successfully, but the farmers declined. A crisis developed when the fields failed to produce satisfac- tory berries. The farmers wisely permitted the crisis to teach its lesson. They visited the experimental farm where they learned how to grow tasty berries.\" SELF-RESCUE \"We are told to place no mind above our own, but I am baffled. How can a confused self rescue the self?\" \"You can put yourself into your own hands or into your own clutches, but you must know the difference in the two.\" \"I am here to learn just that.\" REAL SUCCESS \"In one way or another, most of us feel like failures. Even when financially or socially successful, the feeling of failure continues to haunt.\" \"Forget about society's standards of success. They are miserable failures.

You can be a psychic artist who knows a man's real nature at a glance. Every person leaves his tracks in the snow which can be observed and interpreted. For instance, those who dream of glory in tomorrow have not found themselves today. Also, a man with considerable self-hate will often play the role of a compassionate person.\" ENDLESS DEMANDS \"I am pressured into doing burdensome things I really don't want to do. If I learn how to own my own life will I be free of the endless demands of others?\" \"Of course. It is like owning your own home.

It is incredible that he will suffer terribly from himself without seeking the cause and cure. It is incredible that he will continue to build a kind of security which leaves him just as insecure as be- fore. It is incredible that when given a rescuing fact he promptly twists it to fit his illusions.\" COSMIC VOYAGE \"How does cosmic science explain frantic fights among humans?\" \"Mankind is like passengers on a ship pushing through a heavy fog. Fearful of the unknown ahead, the passengers fight each other for turns at the wheel, each falsely claim- ing to know the way to the safe harbor. After his frantic turn at the wheel a passenger huddles back in his cabin, hoping that the next man at the wheel is not also a bluff- ing charlatan. Everyone makes the same mistake.

Man is really more intelligent than his captors, but fails to exercise his superior wisdom.\" FAME \"From this higher viewpoint, what is fame?\" \"Fame is nothing more than thousands of people think- ing about a particular person. This mass-thinking may see him as good or bad, but it has no relationship what- ever to his actual condition, whatever it may be. Only his own thinking determines his inner state, which means he must not be deluded by public praise. From the viewpoint of God and Reality, fame is meaningless.\""},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"76 THERE IS A WAY OUT PREDICTING HUMAN BEHAVIOR \"It would be valuable to be able to predict human be- havior.' ' \"The behavior of mechanical human beings can be predicted with perfect accuracy. Tell someone the painful truth about himself and he will resent it. Fail to carefully examine your confused ideas and a second troubled day must follow the first. Let two insecure people meet for friendship or romance in an effort to escape insecurity and sooner or later they will quarrel. These unhappy patterns can be broken only by awareness of our mechanicalness, which opens the door to conscious action.\" REAL SECURITY \"I feel nervous when people do not behave toward me the way I expect.\" \"Your real security never depends upon any other per- son behaving toward you in this way or that way. You may think it does, which means you must learn to think from your free mind. Start today.\" \"As you once said, we make our own fog, but happily, we can also make our own sunlight.\" FREEDOM FROM THE STORM! \"Everyone yearns for freedom from the world's chaos.\" \"Your physical body is in the world, but your cosmic self can remain detached from it. Think of a ship's light penetrating into an ocean storm. Though in the storm, the light remains unaffected by its fury. See why? Because the light has a different nature than the storm. This is why all the great teachers reject surface changes in favor of a total- ly new nature. By the way, all this is not just lofty words.

Take gloom. Do people ever see gloom as a self-defeating state, and do they ever see it as an unnecessary pain? Rarely. Not knowing what to do with gloom, people simply wander around and suf- fer from it. They need to be told that something can be done about gloom and every other painful feeling. They need to study esoteric science, which blows away the clouds of misunderstanding.\" THE BOAT \"How do labels prevent cosmic exploration?\" \"Four travelers came to a river they wished to cross. A boat was tied to a tree, ready for their use. However, the boat had no name, which caused an argument among three of the travelers. Each insisted that the boat must be named, also, each demanded the right to supply the name. The fourth man listened quietly as the arguers shouted their preferences, which were Ship of Salvation, Heavenly Guide, and Vessel of Light. The fourth man urged them to simply cross, but they refused, so sighing at their foolishness he took the boat across the river.\" FREEDOM FROM THE PAST \"I would like freedom from my terrible past.\" \"You are now free from it.\" \"But I don't feel it.\" \"That is because you are thinking instead of realizing. Thought functioning as memory seems to tie you to the past, but it is an illusory rope. When thinking about the past you think about it now.

Now I will ask you a ques- tion.\" \"Yes?\" \"What man will admit that someone else knows more than he does? I don't mean a surface admission, or an admission arising from a desperate crisis. Rather, what man will sacrifice his pretense of knowing the answers in order to really change himself?\" \"I see the problem.\" PUBLIC BEHAVIOR \"I am tense in public because I don't know how I am supposed to behave.\" \"There! See! You are supposed to behave! Why on earth are you supposed to act in a preplanned manner? You do this because you want something out of the social situation. You want attention or approval or sex, or may- be you want others to think you are a nicer person than you really are. Find yourself.

The harbor was located at the base of some tall cliffs. Though some- what remote the harbor had been used many times before, so the fishermen felt they would soon be safely docked. To their surprise the boat ran aground. During the night the cliffs had come loose to spill tons of earth into the harbor. That illustrates man's misfortunes. Unseen forces work at night, jolting his complacency. So make the unseen seen. Become conscious.\" AGITATION \"What can I do about my constant state of agitation?\" \"Cease to love it.\" \"Are you saying I am fond of agitation?\" \"Yes, and you fear losing it, for agitation supplies a false feeling of aliveness, a quick thrill. It is cosmic law that you cannot retain anything you cease to love. Cease to cherish agitation and it will depart.\" THE BUTTERFLY \"Where am I making a mistake?\" \"In your present state you are a butterfly caught in the rain. But you make a mistake. Instead of recovering the intelligence by which you could fly out of the rain you just flutter around hating the rain.\" \"Is it possible for me to recover my intelligence?\" \"Of course it is.\" \"Then at all costs I will recover it.\" SELF-COMMAND \"Why do people fail in their quest for self-command?\" \"A man is first told that he lacks self-command. He is then told how to attain it through spiritual and psychologi- cal principles. At this point he usually makes an incredible mistake that blocks self-command. He mistakes intellectual knowledge about self-command for the actual experience"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"82 THERE IS A WAY OUT of self-command. He imagines he possesses what he does not possess, which sphts him down the middle of his psy- chic system. This produces the self-righteous teacher and the alcoholic advisor.

With great elation he tried to find the treasure, but every trail led nowhere. He was about to give up when he found sev- eral other pieces of marked paper in the trunk.

Some- one once commented that an arrogant person humbled by a painful crisis will become arrogant again after the crisis. That single idea has kept me out of trouble with certain people. ' ' REPRESENT YOURSELF! \"Why do I feel so inadequate when facing a crisis?\" \"Because you are not really there. A story will help. A busy businessman sent other people to represent him at business conferences. But one representative was too ner- vous to think clearly, another was lazy, and so on. Their misrepresentations caused the businessman endless grief. Dismissing them, he represented himself on future occa- sions. Likewise, you must not let acquired habits misrepre- sent you. Represent yourself. Let your real nature be pres- ent. It handles every challenge perfectly.\" HURT AND DISAPPOINTMENT \"Why do I get hurt and disappointed so often?\" \"Because you never take the unexpected into account. You hope favorable factors will continue as they are. This hope hardens into a fearful demand. But since life is con- stant change your hopes and demands bump into the un- expected many times daily, causing hurt and disappoint- ment.'

People attracted to the shiny car might find it too faulty for daily use. Man selects large and shiny il- lusions, then wonders why he breaks down. A breakdown can range from a minor irritation to a severe crisis. Break- down is the puncturing of the pretense that one knows what he is doing with his life. Pursue these studies and you will come to the end of breakdowns.\" EXTERIOR GOODNESS \"In reading three different books recently I noticed how each teacher cautioned against the same mistake. They said we must not believe that exterior acts of goodness al- ways indicate a good nature. Why is this point emphasized so much?\" \"Because covering yourself with bird's feathers cannot make you fly.\" COSMIC UNDERSTANDING \"My question is how can I act correctly while in the midst of changing and challenging conditions?\" \"Develop cosmic understanding. This understanding is like a master clock in a school or factory. Keeping right time itself it sends electrical messages to dozens of other clocks throughout the building, making each of them as right as itself.

The prob- lem is built out of the mechanical movements of your own mind. In its insecurity the mind tries to make itself secure by demanding that others behave according to personal de- sire.

Take someone entering a social situation. Reminding him- self of the role he must play for social acceptance he laughs at the jokes or expresses serious concern when told about someone's misfortune. His forced behavior is in sharp conflict with his natural self, which he painfully feels. Out of this comes resentment of his own weakness, which he can neither understand nor cure.\" \"You have just described me. I am tired of living up to what others expect of me.

Please suggest a specific area for investigation.\" \"In his incredible vanity man assumes he knows how this world works. No matter how often his spills and heart- aches tell him different, he never sees through the decep- tive game he plays on himself. For example, someone de- ludes himself into thinking that personal advantages bring security. He never sees his haunting fear of losing his so- called advantages. He could learn how the world works if only he would stop pretending he already knows.\" THE PROBLEM OF FAILURE \"How can I solve the problem of personal failure?\" \"By seeing that the problem itself is false.\" \"I do not understand.\" \"There is no personal failure or success because there is no personal self to create either one. The idea of a per- sonal self creates the idea of personal failure or success.

It bounces back. You toss out your expectations of how^ other people should treat you, then get hurt when they refuse to accept you at your own value.

For selfish rea- sons the large fox told the young fox that salty sea water was healthier than water from the forest stream. The taste of the young fox told him a different story, but he was too dominated by the older fox to do more than suspect the cruel hoax.

They were told to go home and remain there until a messenger arrived who would inform them of time and place of the first class. On the first day of school, only three people entered. The rest had been absent when the messenger arrived, out making money or amusing themselves. Your mind can receive valuable messages every minute, but you must be home to yourself.\" CHOICE \"Do we have a choice or do we not?\" \"In his present mental confusion man is like a leaf blown up and down, left and right by every changing breeze. If a leaf thought like a man it would claim that it chose its own movements. Take a furious man or a de- jected woman. Did they choose these feelings or were they blown into them by forces beyond their control?\" \"Clearly, they have no choice. But can they change?\" \"You can choose to turn yourself over to negative breezes or you can choose to not do so. Start with that.

When driving your car, be attentive to driving; do not be lost in imagination. When meeting an unexpected event, do not react from stale memory, but see the event with a fresh mind which is unconnected with the past. Your mind is like a fully equipped kitchen that contains spoons, forks, and other cooking tools. In daily living, do not get your mental tools mixed up, but use the right tool.\" THE BELL \"How can we expand our thinking?\" \"By becoming aware of limited thinking. A visitor was inside a famous temple in Japan when its bell began to ring. The visitor asked the bell-ringer why the bell was sounding at this particular hour. The bell-ringer said it was because he was pulling on the rope. Limited thinking exists when one is able to see only visible causes.\" REST YOUR MIND \"If we could just take a vacation from mental storms.\" \"These teachings show you how. There is something you must understand quite clearly. There is thinking and there is seeing. Thinking is necessary for daily tasks, but seeing is essential for psychic wholeness and the ease that goes with it. In this class you will learn how to alternate between practical thinking, as when cooking, and seeing, as when realizing that you need not seek approval from others. There are no storms in this natural alternation be- tween thinking and seeing, so the mind is always at rest.\" IMITATION INTELLIGENCE \"Last week in class you said that man lives from imi- tation intelligence.

I saw clearly the miserable results of letting other people think for me.\" TRANSFORMED MIND \"I wish to escape my unhappy mind.\" \"Can you escape your own body?\" \"No.\" \"Neither can you escape your own mind.\" \"Then my case is hopeless.\" \"Not at all. The mind cannot be escaped, but it can be transformed.\" \"How?\" \"Cease to take a peculiar pleasure in thinking un- happy thoughts.\" BOTHERATION \"I am bothered by what other people think of me.\" \"You have never been bothered by that. It is your thoughts about their thoughts that bother you.

Since some of us are new to these classes, may we have an explanation of this phrase?\" \"A false feeling of life is a damaging substitute for true life. One lives in fiery thrills instead of from calm realities. It is as if an exploding volcano felt as alive as a human being. Take argument. If you let someone win every point in an argument he loses interest in the battle, for his ex- citement vanishes. If you wish to find true life, steadily reduce and fmally eliminate false feelings of life.\" OBSERVABLE SELF-TRANSFORMATION \"I have worked on myself according to these principles, but self- transformation eludes me.\" \"Work patiently on. A medical scientist can peer into a microscope to observe just how a medicine works upon and heals a human illness. He can actually see the change take place.

They don't know what to say or how to say it. They believe they must play a role, but worry that it might be seen through.

But an awakened man sees through so-called normal people, being fully aware of their buried terrors and compulsions.

Before a beginner can become a learner, all such immaturity must go.\" FIND OUT \"Everything goes against me.\" \"Who is this me you speak about?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Find out, and nothing will go against you.\" COMPETENT MANAGER \"Since not everyone wants the message that an awak- ened man has to give, how does he know which ones to teach?\" \"He knows. Seeing through human nature, he easily distinguishes between those who pretend to want the truth and those who really do. He can be compared with a com- petent hotel manager. Five guests in the hotel ask to be called at six in the morning. Five other guests say they do not want to be disturbed at any time. The manager knows who to call and who to leave alone. But a man who mere- ly imagines he is awake makes mindless blunders. Getting his lists mixed up, he calls the wrong people and gets into trouble.\" RIGHT FEELINGS \"Everyone wants to feel right, but nothing we do at- tracts right feelings.\" \"The solution is so simple that few ever see it.\" \"Are you saying that we miss the obvious?\" \"We choose what is popular instead of what is right and then wonder why we don't feel right.\""},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"148 THERE IS A WAY OUT HOW TO FIND A NEW WAY \"Why is my way so hard?\" \"Because you are hard.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"It means that you and your way are the same thing.

But how can it be so? Past follies are like wolves inside our minds. Every few days they leap out to attack us.\" \"The past can exist in your memory without affecting the present moment, for you do not live in time; you live only in Now. See this, and the illusory power of the past falls away.\" \"You know, I was afraid to ask that question.\" \"For fear there might not be an answer?\" \"Right!\" THE HYPNOTIZED LAMB \"It is painful to be at the mercy of exterior events.\" \"A lamb was hypnotized by some evil wolves and was told a peculiar falsehood. They made him believe he would be happy when the wind blew westward, but would be sad when the wind blew eastward. The innocent lamb accepted this nonsense without question. So not only did he suffer half the time, but felt helpless and irritable at having lost control of his own feelings. But he studied his condition until seeing through the hypnotic hoax.

In almost every case it thinks that the man has no conscience toward other people, that is, he is cruel and deceitful to others. That is true, but only one person in ten million can see deeper than that. That rare person sees that the conscienceless man also has no con- science toward himself. He is not divided into two people, one of them kindly to himself and the other heartless to- ward others. His lack of conscience punishes himself at the same instant it injures others, though he rarely sees it.\" SELF-FINDING \"Daily life is so dull.\" \"Try finding yourself. Nothing is more fascinating.\" CURE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL \"This class has helped me see something startling but valuable about certain social involvements. I used to think they gave me something, but now I see how they drained the energy needed for constructive living.\" \"Your experience is quite characteristic of those who at- tend to their lessons.

By the way, such a truly independent man is free from quarrels, for al- lies always end up battling each other.\" RIGHT RECEPTACLE \"How can we stop attracting adversity?\" \"Let your mind be a right receptacle for offered truths. A citizen of a hot and dry country owned a well having an abundance of water. A generous man, he hung a sign over the well which invited weary travelers to freely fill their jugs. Over the years the citizen observed a tragic fact. The jugs of some of the travelers were too small, others leaked, while still others were too frail. He knew their journey would be difficult, for they had faulty recep- tacles.\" EVERYTHING CAN BE DONE \"Something you said in the last class made a deep im- pression on me.

Accordingly, the musicians placed the needed music on their stands. At the signal from the director the orchestra played — a horrible blast, shocking to ears. What went wrong? Each musician played his own preferred selection. While pretending to be part of the harmonious whole, each man actually played his secret and self-centered preference. That is why talk about human harmony is just talk. And that is why mankind suffers from shocking blasts.\" PLANS \"My plans seldom work out.\" \"Individual plans do not exist. Everything is a move- ment of the Cosmic Whole, which includes you.\" \"But sometimes I get what I want.\" \"Pure coincidence.

If you did not love feelings of frustration you would never be frustrated by anything.\" QUALITIES THAT COUNT \"How can we start to possess qualities that count?\" \"There is only one right start. We must stop attributing qualities to ourselves and to others which do not in fact exist. Calling an artificial pearl a real pearl prevents knowl- edge of the real gem.\" FACTS ABOUT SELF-TEACHING \"Do I need a teacher, or can I teach myself?\" \"Suppose you attend a class to learn to speak French. But other students want to learn Spanish, German, Dutch and other languages. Wishing to please everyone in order to get his fees, the teacher gives you only an occasional word of French. But even this is worthless, for you cannot as yet distinguish between French and the other languages. So you must teach yourself until getting some idea of the nature of French. Then when meeting an authentic and con- scientious teacher, your own knowledge will reveal his authenticity and you will want to learn from him.\" PRESENCE AND ABSENCE \"How can we tell just where we are living in illusion?\" \"Presence of pain, presence of illusion.

So how can we distinguish between cosmic goodness and the artificial version?\" \"False goodness always attracts a negative reaction. For instance, the next time you generously contribute your time and energy to others, observe whether you secretly resent it. This indicates that the so-called generosity was merely a trading game.

What are you?\" \"I see what you mean.\" COME OUT OF HIDING \"What is the aim of an awakened man?\" \"To call frightened people out of hiding. A cruel warrior once led his savage troops in an invasion of a weak na- tion. The terrified citizens fled to caves in distant mountains.

Give a voyager a breath of cosmic air and he will never turn back to the old land.\" FEELING OF RELEASE \"One of the strongest impressions I ever received in this class occurred the night you spoke about artificial duties. Just hearing about the way we needlessly burden ourselves inspired a feeling of release.\" \"A careless man let himself be hypnotized into believing it was necessary to carry a heavy rock on his back during the day. He believed that failure to carry the rock would make him a guilty or lazy person. So he dutifully and re- sentfully placed the rock on his back every morning before leaving home. So living from an imaginary self creates imag- inary obligations.\" \"We want to snap out of the hypnosis!\" OPINIONS AND FACTS \"We are urged over and over to drop acquired opinions. But this would leave us without a steering wheel.\" \"Where has your steering wheel taken you up to now?\" \"But what would I be without strong opinions?\" \"A real person. You mistake opinions for facts without realizing you are doing so. The only way to obtain liberat- ing facts is to first drop enslaving opinions.\""},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Royal Adventures Along The Way Out 169 HOW ANXIETY FADES \"One idea supplied several months ago helped me con- siderably. You summarized man's problem to himself. It is his incapacity to listen to anything beyond his rigid assump- tions as to what is right. As I have dropped fixed assump- tions, I have noticed the lessening of anxiety.\" \"Yes. Anxiety fades. It resembles the beat of a drum that falls at longer and longer intervals until disappearing altogether.\" WISH TO UNDERSTAND \"When pained people seek help at a truth- lecture, where do they make a mistake?\" \"People come with a desire to get rid of the pain, but not with a wish to understand. No greater blunder could be made, for pain ends only through understanding. To reach higher understanding it is necessary to pass through the val- ley of ego-humiliation, which most people refuse to do. Therefore they continue to alternate between pain and a temporary escape into daydreams.\" \"The trouble with escaping into dreams is that reality is always shaking us awake.\" HIGHER LEVEL \"In what way is an awakened man on a higher level than I?\" \"You think. He sees.'' THE MARVELOUS BOAT \"What prevents us from learning from a man who knows?\" \"Wrong attitudes toward him. A seaman built a small boat for himself which was the marvel of the harbor. It sailed with the smallest breeze. The skilled seaman was will- ing to teach others to build their own marvelous boats, but few ever asked for his instructions. Some wanted to substitute"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"170 THERE IS A WAY OUT their own ideas, while others simply asked for a ride in the seaman's boat. Some people plainly showed envy, while some faint-hearted builders gave up shortly after starting. But the few who really wanted to learn soon had their own marvelous boats.\" FUTURE \"What is my future?\" \"Your nature is your future. The simplest of logic reveals that your nature must repeat itself tomorrow. The one way to change your future is to change your nature. But you must really change it, and not merely imagine that you are differ- ent.\" \"Thanks to this class I am becoming more aware of how imagination masquerades as reality.\" GREAT SECRET \"The world is so overwhelmed with anxiety.\" \"Yes, but a great secret exists for the earnest individual. Instead of merely suffering from anxiety he can study it. See the simple difference?\" \"Yes. It is obvious that only the facts can save us.\" \"Of course, but how many people want to face the facts? It is like the woman who kept reading that too much candy was bad for her health, so she gave up reading.\" PERSONAL MANUSCRIPT \"I am trying to see how I cause my own experiences.\" \"An ancient manuscript was discovered in a dungeon of a castle in the Rhineland. At first the author's identity was unknown, but close inspection of the last page disclosed the writer's name. Close examination of individual urges and motives disclose that the individual himself is the author of whatever happens to him. He writes his own life-manu- script.\" COSMIC COMMUNICATION \"How is cosmic consciousness communicated?\" \"It happens only under unique circumstances. Precisely,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Royal Adventures Along The Way Out 171 it occurs when a man who knows meets a man who wants to know. Cosmic communication results, as though a ray of light appeared between them.\" ''But how can an ordinary man experience this?\" \"You are already an extraordinary man if you really want to know. This ardent wish will lead you to someone who knows.\" CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES ''If I am deceiving myself I want to know about it.\" \"You still believe that a change in circumstances will make you happy. How little you understand. Surround a bored man with exciting activities and he will soon be bored again. Give a frustrated man everything he demands and his frustration will remain to torture him. Only a profound change in the way we think can make us happy.\" SELF-DIVISION \"You urge us toward self-union? What is self-division?\" \"There was once a rich and powerful nobleman who was envied and admired by everyone. One day a poor man ac- cidentally wandered on to the private grounds of the noble- man. With angry threats the rich man ordered the poor man away. From that day forward the poor man never again envied or admired the rich man. The poor man understood self-division. He knew it meant to appear in public to be worthy of praise, but to be the private slave of rage.\" DYNAMIC SENTENCES \"I have written down several dynamic sentences which have impressed me during the last few classes. Maybe they would interest others.\" \"Please read them aloud to us.\" \"Never permit anyone to impose a sense of guilt upon you. A negative man provokes negativity in others and then wonders why he is surrounded by negative people. Saying we want correction and taking correction are two different"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"172 THERE IS A WAY OUT things. There is no truth whatever in fiery argument. All is well for the earnest person, for the Answer exists.\" QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS \"I am utterly weary of asking so many baffling ques- tions - ' ' \"Wonderful! Now you can listen to enlightening an- swers.\" THE BUILDER \"Why are we afraid? What is the cure?\" \"A man began to build a house. Because he lazily re- fused to obtain knowledge about his work he built the house with faulty materials. The higher the house rose the more fear he felt. One day, in a moment of great decision, he abandoned the house to start a new one with reliable mater- ials. His fear vanished.\" TRUTH \"What is meant by the word truthl^\" \"Truth is anything that helps you to become a different kind of person than you now are. It is truth to explore un- familiar ideas, to admit self-contradictions, to slow down mechanical reactions. It is truth to refuse to fear anyone, to determine to think for yourself, to take a first small step to- ward inner newness.\" REMEMBER \"Please review a principal task.\" \"Our task is to remember our cosmic homeland. It is like a boy kidnapped and then abandoned in a foreign land. While wandering around he remembers a wooded hill he used to climb at home, then recalls a favorite brook. The road to home comes back to mind, then details of the home itself. This remembrance guides him homeward. Likewise, we must remember our homeland nature. For example, at first we might recall our hidden talent for remaining calm"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Royal Adventures Along The Way Out 173 when criticized.
