There is a way out. And you can find it. I assure you of this. This book contains the concentrated wisdom of the ages. In this power-packed volume are all the answers you need for winning a New Life. Its solutions are simple, accurate, helpful. Here are the authentic answers to questions which have haunted man throughout the ages. It shows you how to abolish fear and loneliness, what to do about painful problems with other people, how to achieve ease, confidence, and a self-independence beyond your fondest dreams. As you read, remember that the mystic path is unique, different. It is precisely this difference that makes it work for you. Have your old and usual ways uplifted you? If not, you can see the pleasant necessity of this totally fresh method. You see, the mystics whom you will meet are the most practical men on earth. They have no interest in fancy words; they simply and directly invite, 'Come, let me show you how to be an entirely new person.' So be cheerfully willing to explore this fascinating world of the unknown. Let go of the past completely — it has done nothing for you. Desire to rise above your present self. Explore with an interested and alert mind, for that is what turns everything into gold. As an extra value, you will find that some of these sets of questions and answers form a continued conversation for a while, just as if you were speaking back and forth with these great teachers. Here are your five self-enriching programmes: Programme 1: After your first reading of this book, practise random reading. The advantage of this volume is the ease with which you can pick it up and start reading anywhere. So"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"8 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! open it when you have a few minutes at lunch, or between home projects. These short refreshments keep you inspired. . Programme 2: Join or form a study group. Great gain can be made when a number of earnest people come together for self-development. Large or small groups can meet in home, office, or church. The leader can read a page or two, then direct the discussion. Programme 3: Write down the numbers of your favourite answers. There is a healthy reason why you received special impressions from them. Write them out on separate slips of paper and carry them with you. Now, fully mine their gold by memorizing and reflecting upon them. Programme 4: Note all the answers which cover a topic of special interest to you, or which cover a specific problem, for example, you may wish to know all about freedom from anxiety. Then, read all the answers to your topic in one reading session. This brightens your understanding, just as a tourist understands a French castle better by viewing it from all sides. Programme 5: This is the most important programme of your life! Work at seeing something much higher in these truths than appears to you at first glance. Let them tell you their secret story. The power of these lofty truths wishes to contact you, and it can succeed as you make it welcome. And then, at last, you will know. Perhaps you have asked, 'Can I really know the truth that sets me free?' The answer is, of course you can. And you can start right now. You see, when the mystic masters speak, they know what they are talking about. So join them, and you will hear and understand the secret story; you will know what life is all about, and you will be the commander of your own life.

The Practical Power of Mystic Principles 1. Q: May I come right to the point? What are mystical studies all about? Are they practical? What will they do for us? A: If you devote your time to study, you will avoid all the irksome things of life, and you will not long for the approach of night, being tired of the day, and you will not be a burden to yourself, and your company will be acceptable to others. (Seneca) 2. Q: But do these lofty mystical principles help us in daily matters, such as the solving of problems and in the making of necessary decisions? Heavenly ideas have their place, but we need down-to-earth assistance. A : The contemplation of celestial things will make a man both speak and think more sublimely and magnificently when he descends to human affairs. (Cicero) 3. Q: What about the control of personal habits? Can these principles give us a new and a complete command over ourselves, including the removal of unwanted habits? A : Even the food and drink necessary for restoration will lie outside the soul's attention, and not less the sexual appetite ... it will turn upon the actual needs of nature and be entirely under control. (Plotinus) 4. Q: I don't have any large personal problems, but am puzzled by life in general. For example, why are we here on earth, and what am I supposed to be doing with myself? A: We are surrounded by a rich and fertile mystery."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"10 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! May we not probe it, pry into it, employ ourselves about it, a little? (Thoreau) 5. Q: Then there is a definite answer regarding the purpose of life? A : To be what we are, and to become what we are capable of becoming, is the only aim of life. (Spinoza) 6. Q: I have always yearned to simply be myself, but tell me, how does it contribute to personal happiness? A : Resolve to be thyself; and know, that he who finds himself, loses his misery. (Arnold) 7. Q: What will be the signs that we are solving these mysteries of life for ourselves? A: To be happy, to possess eternal life, to be in God, to be saved — all these are the same. All alike mean the solution of the problem, the aim of existence. And happiness is cumulative, as misery may be. An eternal growth is an unchangeable peace, an ever more profound depth of understanding, a possession constantly more intense and more spiritual with the joy of heaven — this is happiness. Happiness has no limits. (Amiel) 8. Q: I want to work at self-transformation, but I have no confidence in my mental abilities to understand what I must do. A : We can be men without being sages. Without spending our days in the study of morality, we possess at a cheaper rate a more certain guide through the immense and perplexing labyrinth of human opinions. It is not enough, however, that such a guide exists — it is necessary to know and follow her. (Rousseau) 9. Q: What is this authentic guide? A : Be a lamp unto yourself. (Buddha)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE PRACTICAL POWER OF MYSTIC PRINCIPLES 1 1 You are wiser than you think! 10. Q: I would give anything to be sure that my fate is not forever fixed, that I can really break completely away from my present negative patterns and enter a new way. A : A strict belief in fate is the worst of slavery, imposing upon our necks an everlasting lord and tyrant, who we stand in awe of night and day. (Epicuras) 11. Q: Then change and elevation of both self and circumstance is truly possible? A : Man is man, and master of his fate. (Tennyson) 12. Q: In this world of rapid changes, all of us seem to be seeking something more secure and permanent. Will you please comment on this? A : One truth discovered is immortal, and entitles its author to be so: for, like a new substance in nature, it cannot be destroyed. (Hazlitt) 13. Q: But maybe only certain types of people are able to set off on the mystic path. Or maybe we can take it up only when we have enough money or leisure; when we are free of the demands of everyday life. A: You think it is because I have an income which exempts me from your day-labour, that I waste (as you call it) my time in sun-gazing and star-gazing. You do not know me. If my debts, as they threaten, should consume what money I have, I should live just as I do now: I should eat worse food, and wear a coarser coat, and should wander in a potato patch instead of in the wood — but it is I, and not my twelve hundred dollars a year, that love God. (Emerson) 14. Q: I am aware that we must make personal efforts, but I am not sure as to what they are. A: Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. (Jesus)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"1 2 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! 15. Q: Feelings of inferiority have always prevented me from attempting to climb the mountain. I often think that I lack the necessary inner qualities. A : On the other hand, we are often wiser than we fancy ourselves to be ... In the great moments of life, when a man decides upon an important step, his action is directed not so much by any clear knowledge of the right thing to do, as by an inner impulse — you may almost call it intuition — proceeding from the deepest foundations of his being. (Schopenhauer) 16. Q: But what if we have limited time for attending to the inner life? A: One day, with life and heart, is more than time enough to find a world. (Lowell) Your path to lasting delight 1 7. Q: Sometimes I find myself letting go of the mad rush of daily duties to wonder about myself and my activities. Surely there is something higher for us than the usual pursuits of making money and raising families. Do other people also have this feeling of wonder? A : But often in the world's most crowded streets, but often, in the din of strife, there rises an unspeakable desire after the knowledge of our buried life, a thirst to spend our fire and restless force in tracking out our true, original course; a longing to inquire into the mystery of this heart that beats so wild, so deep in us, to know whence our thoughts come and where they go. (Arnold) 18. Q: Will you please supply an example of a practical esoteric truth which needs our sincere study in order to make its value our own value? A: Without going out of doors, one may know the whole world; without looking out of the window, one may see the way \"i heaven. The further one travels, the less one may know. Thus it is thai without moving you may know; without looking you shall sec; without doing you shall succeed. (Lao-tse)"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE PRACTICAL POWER OF MYSTIC PRINCIPLES 1 9 19. Q: I often fed enslaved by compulsive duties. I do them because I feel I must or should do them. Because of this, I am a whirlpool of resentment and guilt. Is it wrong to want to break out of this nightmare and to start living my own life? A : I would have nobody to control me; I would be absolute . . . Now, he that is absolute can do what he likes; he that can do what he likes can take his pleasure; he that can take his pleasure can be content; and he that can be content has no more to desire. So the matter is over, and come what will come, I am satisfied. (Cervantes) 20. Q: I have always had a timid and apologetic attitude towards other people, which 1 dislike. I am encouraged by everything you say, but 1 am still what I am. A : I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood; I sec that the elementary laws never apologize. (Whitman) 21. Q: So how can 1 set myself 1Y< A: Who has bound you? (/en) 22. Q: I sense something very right and very reassuring about everything we have covered so far. Will you please explain this feeling? A: These are not fictions of a visionary imagination, but sober truths, spoken by the word of God in scripture, and written and engraven in the book of every man's own nature. (Law) 23. Q: Most of us have false values of one kind or another. We need guidance in exchanging shallow activities for more profitable ones. Please suggest a method. A: There is nothing so delightful as the hearing or the speaking of truth. For this reason, there is no conversation so agreeable as that oJ a man of integrity, who hears without an\\ intention to betray, and speaks without any intention to deceive. (Plato)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"1 4 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! 24. Q: Will authentic values become clearer to us as we watchfully proceed? A : Evident as the sun at noon. (Carlyle) The interesting discoveries you will make 25. Q: Suppose we reach this state of inner unity. Does this mean that the people and circumstances that now disturb us can have no more influence on our peace of mind? A : No matter where you place it, gold is gold. (Ramakrishna) 26. Q: What results have been obtained by those people who have dived deeply into esoteric waters? I mean, have they found special rewards in this inner world? A : It was my conviction that I could not do better than continue in that in which I was engaged,. . . in making the greatest progress I was able in the knowledge of truth . . . This method, from the time I began to apply it, has been to me the source of satisfaction so intense as to make me believe that a more perfect or more innocent occupation could not be enjoyed in this life. By its means, I daily discovered truths that appeared to me of great importance, and of which other men were generally ignorant. The arising satisfaction so occupied my mind that I was wholly indif- ferent to every other object. (Descartes) 27. Q: What discovered truth would open the door to lasting self-contentment? A : He is happy as well as great who needs neither to obey nor to command in order to be something. (Goethe) 28. Q: Does the absorption of mystic principles provide a man with the endurance needed for going on to new successes? A : No man could ever make him face about. (Bunyan) 29. Q: To summarize at this point, why is it necessary for us to study these mystical and esoteric teachings?"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE PRACTICAL POWER OF MYSTIC PRINCIPLES 1 5 A : The true sovereign of the world, who moulds the world like soft wax, according to his pleasure, is he who lovingly sees into the world. (Carlyle) 30. Q: I am easily upset by unexpected events which force me to change my plans. It is more annoying than tragic, still, it is no way to go through the day. May I have your comment? A : The man of inner life is easily aware of himself, since he is never totally absorbed in outward affairs. Therefore, his exterior occupations and necessary activities do not distract him, and he adjusts himself to things as they come. The man whose inner life is well-ordered, is not bothered by strange and troublesome ways of others. A man is blocked and distracted by such things only as he permits himself to be. (Kempis) 31. Q: Why are these great principles not known and practised by mankind as a whole? A: The secrets of life are not shown except to sympathy and likeness. (Emerson) 32. Q: In other words, each person must eagerly want them for himself? A: Dare to be wise! (Horace) How your natural forces help you 33. Q: Everything seems to depend upon the source we look to for help. What rule can we follow? A : Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. (New Testament) 34. Q: Why do we fail so often in our attempts to win what we want? Why do results so often turn out contrary to our desires? A : We, ignorant of ourselves, beg often our own harms, which the wise powers deny us for our good; so find we profit by losing of our prayers. (Shakespeare)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"16 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! 35. Q: Please explain what you mean by human ignorance. A : By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on purely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true law. (Thoreau) 36. Q: How can we awaken our natural powers and turn them to practical use? A: The mason employed on the building of a house may be quite ignorant of its general design, or, at any rate, he may not keep it constantly in mind. So it is with man: in working through the days and hours of his life, he takes little thought of its character as a whole ... It is only when we come to view our life as a connected whole that our character and capacities show themselves in their true light; that we see how, in particular instances, some happy inspiration, as it were, led us to choose the only true path out of a thousand which might have brought us to ruin. (Schopenhauer) 37. Q: Then it is correct to say that all wisdom is really self-wisdom? A : The kingdom of heaven is within. (Jesus) 38. Q: I believe I understand this, but let me review. If we work and solve the mysteries of ourselves, we solve all other mysteries? A : As a man-of-war that sails through the sea, so this earth that sails through the air. We mortals are all on board a fast-sailing, never-sinking world-frigate, of which God was the ship-wright . . . Thus sailing with sealed orders, we ourselves are the repositories of the secret packet, whose mysterious contents we long to learn. There are no mysteries out of ourselves. (Melville) 39. Q: No matter how hard I try to shake it off, a deep feeling of loneliness clings to me. I was told that mysticism has a new and workable solution to this problem, but I wonder whether I will be able to grasp it."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE PRACTICAL POWER OF MYSTIC PRINCIPLES 1 7 A : An heir finds the title-deeds of his house. Will he say, 'Perhaps they are forged?', and neglect to examine them? (Pascal) 40. Q: How can we aid our own self-work? A : Patience is powerful. (Longfellow) A technique for pleasant living 41. Q: What healthy changes will come to us as a result of acquiring information of a mystical nature? A : From this kind of knowledge arises the most perfect satisfaction and contentment. (Spinoza) 42. Q: I would like to use my mind for the specific purpose of avoiding hurt feelings when dealing with other people. How can I do this, for example, when I am criticized or slandered by someone? A : Say nothing more to yourself than what the first appearances report. Suppose that it has been reported to you that a certain person speaks ill of you. This has been reported, but that you have been injured has not been reported . . . Thus then always abide by the first appearances, and add nothing yourself from within, and then nothing hurtful happens to you. (Aurelius) 43. Q: What if we make foolish mistakes along the spiritual path? A : I will go a thousand leagues in falsehood, that one step of the journey may be true. (Sufism) 44. Q: Why do we fail to learn from our mistakes? A: The fox condemns the trap, not himself. (Blake) 45. Q: Speaking of mistakes and illusions, Shakespeare said that nothing is what it seems. Does this apply to human friendships? A : What men have given the name of friendship to is"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"18 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! nothing but an alliance, a reciprocal accommodation of interests, an exchange of good offices; in fact, it is nothing but a system of traffic, in which self-love always proposes to itself some advantage. (La Rochefoucauld) 46. Q: What simple rule can we rely upon for right behaviour at all times under all circumstances? A : What is rational is real, and what is real is rational. (Hegel) 47. Q: I am attracted to esoteric teachings because they point the way back to the simple and natural life. Will you please supply a technique for recovering naturalness? A : Be neither the slave of your impulses and sensations of the moment, nor of an abstract and general plan; be open to what life brings from within and without, and welcome the unforeseen, and give to your life unity, and bring the unforeseen within the lines of your plan. Let what is natural in you raise itself to the level of the spiritual, and let the spiritual become once more natural. Thus will your develop- ment be harmonious. (Amiel) 48. Q: People chatter so much about inner freedom, but few seem to really possess it. How can we start to understand the true meaning of self-liberty? A: The wish to untie, through understanding of their true nature, the chains of selfishness and sensuality — this is the yearning for freedom. (Shankara) 49. Q: I sense how practical all this really is, but hope it is a sunny path as well. A: Cheerful, and yet profound, like an October afternoon. (Nietzsche) 50. Q: No longer do I believe in what human beings carelessly label as love, however, authentic love must have a part in mystical wisdom. What is an elementary lesson? A: Love is ever the beginning of knowledge, as fire is of light. (Carlyle)"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE PRACTICAL POWER OF MYSTIC PRINCIPLES 1 9 Your stream of power and wisdom 51. Q: I am frustrated by my failure to attain my financial goals. What particular knowledge do I need? A : Condition, circumstance, is not the thing; bliss is the same in subject or in king. (Pope) 52. Q: I have a strong wish to live in this kind of calm happiness, so could you be more specific about its attain- ment? How is it possible to banish strain and pressure in business matters? A : A little consideration of what takes place around us every day would show us that a higher law than that of our will regulates events; that our painful labours are unnecessary and fruitless; that only in our easy, simple, spontaneous action are we strong . . . Place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and wisdom which animates all whom it floats, and you are without effort impelled to truth, to right, and a perfect contentment. (Emerson) 53. Q: If a man floated in the very centre of this stream of truth he would be a king! A: Let him regain his Kingdom! (Bhagavad-Gita) 54. Q: We now have the facts, but need a method for making them part of our lives. A : Let us put the ideas of our mind, just as we put things of the laboratory, to the test of experience. (Locke) 55. Q: Several of us in town have formed a study group for weekly exploration of mystic and esoteric principles. May we have a helpful idea for our first discussion? A : True religion is the establishment by man of such a relationship to the Infinite Life around him, which, while connecting his life with Infinite Life, and directing his actions, is also in agreement with his reason and with human knowledge. (Tolstoy)"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! 56. Q: I want to be a winner in life, but I don't really understand what it means to win. A : Self-conquest is the greatest of victories. (Plato) 57. Q: What if we find difficulty in understanding what we must do? A : Truth makes all things plain. (Shakespeare) 58. Q: I am curious about a particular point about the various schools of mysticism, such as Taoism, Zen, and Sufism. They were founded in different places and ages, yet all teach the same basic principles. A : There is one river of truth, which receives tribu- taries from every side. (Clement) 59. Q: May we have some general rules for psychic success? A : These are the stages through which we have to pass, and all those who persevere will succeed. Give up all argumentation and other distractions. Is there anything in this dry intellectual jargon? It only throws the mind off its balance and disturbs it. These things have to be realized. Will talking do that? So give up all vain talk. Read only those books which have been written by persons who have had realization. (Vivekananda) 60. Q: How does this procedure bring good results? A : People, generally, are not aware of the ease of mind there is in knowing where they are, and where they are going. The sensation of being lost is a keen distress. (Wallace) How to maintain perfect poise 61. Q: I believe you teach the existence of something which is totally different from the thousands of competing and contradictory opinions about life. A : There are not different truths in the world, for truth is one and the same at all times and in every place. (Buddhism)"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE PRACTICAL POWER OF MYSTIC PRINCIPLES 21 62. Q: Are right and constructive thoughts always available to us? A : As you grow ready for it, somewhere or other you will find what is needful for you in a book or a friend, or, best of all, in your own thoughts — the eternal thought speaking in your thought. (MacDonald) 63. Q: What is the mystical definition of greatness? A : He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. (Old Testament) 64. Q: Why do unhappy people fail to profit by listening to those who have superior spiritual insight? A : We think few people sensible except those who are of our own opinion. (La Rochefoucauld) 65. Q: In order to act, man needs some sort of motivation. What can light a fire under us to make us move towards the true life? A : I appeal to nothing but the state of your own hearts and consciences, to prove the necessity of your embracing this mystery of divine love. (Law) 66. Q: After searching for the answers to life for a long time, I have at least one solid conviction — organized society knows nothing. For example, I recently attended a meeting for the promotion of world peace — and the people spent most of their time fighting among themselves! A : Take another example — a roomful of guests in full dress, being received with great ceremony. You could almost believe that this is a noble and distinguished company; but, as a matter of fact, it is compulsion, pain and boredom who are the real guests. For where many are invited, it is a rabble — even if they all wear stars. Really good society is everywhere of necessity very small. In brilliant festivals and noisy entertainments, there is always, at bottom, a sense of emptiness prevalent. A false tone is there. (Schopenhauer)"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"22 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! 67. Q: How can we retain our integrity and our poise when surrounded by such social falseness? A : To live in the presence of great truths and eternal laws — that is what keeps a man patient when the world ignores him, and calm and unspoiled when the world praises him. (Balzac) 68. Q: I am attracted by the idea of discovering new cosmic worlds which are now beyond my inner sight. How can I best apply myself? A : Thinkers are as scarce as gold, but he whose thoughts embrace all his subject, pursues it persistently and is fearless of consequences, is a diamond of enormous size. (Lavater) 69. Q: As all the great philosophers and religious teachers point out, most men live in an artificial happiness. I don't want to go along with it any longer. A : Freedom has a thousand charms to show, that slaves, however contented, never know. (Cowper) 70. Q: That is the message I have wanted to hear for many years. A : Why not, then, take steps to be free? (Plautus) A helpful summary of Chapter 1 a. Mystic principles are practical powers for daily use. b. If you wish to change your life, you can succeed at it. c. Make up your mind to live your own life! d. The mystic way is one of delightful discoveries. e.

Q: I am no longer satisfied with the shallow answers to life, which society offers so freely. The disasters we see all around us are evidence enough of society's failure. If it takes an independent search to break out of the desert, I am willing to make it. What must I know at the start? A : If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. (Thoreau) 72. Q: So the chief cause of the human problem is human delusion? A : Human life is thus only an endless illusion. Men deceive and flatter each other. No one speaks of us in our presence as he does when we are gone. Society is based on mutual hypocrisy. (Pascal) 73. Q: And the solution? A : If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is — infinite. (Blake) 74. Q: How can we find proof of the Tightness of this?

Q: We have so many clamouring voices inside us which command us to do this or that. It is difficult to decide which ones speak for our true benefit. A : Whenever conscience speaks with a divided, un- certain, and disputed voice, it is not yet the voice of God. Descend still deeper into yourself, until you hear nothing but a clear and undivided voice, a voice which does away with doubt and brings with it persuasion, light, and serenity. Happy, says the Apostle, are they who are at peace with themselves, and whose heart condemns them not in the part they take. (Amiel) 77. Q: There was a time when I used to view life more clearly than I do at present. I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the way I must have fallen asleep. A : To recover your life is in your power. Look at things again as you used to look at them, for in this consists the recovery of your life. (Aurelius) 78. Q: What good results can be expected from self- awakening? A : You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. (Jesus) 79. Q: What kind of truth will supply inner liberty?

A : Dare to be true. Nothing can need a lie. (Herbert) 85. Q: I am afraid that most of us will have a lot of admitting to do! A : A man should never be ashamed to own he has been in the wrong, which is but saying, in other words, that he is wiser today than he was yesterday. (Pope) 86. Q: It has been said that knowledge is not the same thing as wisdom. Will you please explain the difference? A : Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one, have oft-times no connection. Knowledge dwells in heads replete with thoughts of other men; wisdom in minds attentive to their own. (Cowper) 87. Q: So our aim must be to go beyond mere head- knowledge?

I wonder why they give so much attention to the losing of negative features, instead of showing us how to acquire positive traits. A: We lop away that bearing boughs may live. (Shakespeare) 119. Q: It is strange how we resist the loss of those very things that harm us. A : So Nature deals with us, and takes away our playthings one by one, and by the hand leads us to rest. (Longfellow) 120.

A: A man should always have these two rules in readiness: the one, to do only whatever the reason of the ruling and legislating faculty may suggest . . . the other, to change his opinion, if some other person sets him right, and moves him from an opinion. But this change of opinion must proceed only from a certain persuasion, as of what is just or of common advantage, and the like, not because it appears pleasant or brings reputation. (Aurelius) 132.

A : The beautiful attracts the beautiful. (Hunt) 156. Q: We are all so impatient and so frustrated in our dealings with each other. By what method can we show more gentleness and understanding? A : The art of putting up with people may be learned by practising patience on inanimate objects, which, in virtue of some mechanical or general physical necessity, oppose a stubborn resistance to our freedom of action — a form of patience which is required every day. The patience thus gained may be applied to our dealings with men, by accustoming ourselves to regard their opposition, wherever we encounter it, as the inevitable outcome of their nature, which sets itself up against us according to the same rigid law of necessity which governs the resistance of inanimate objects.

A: The chief of our concerns is that of ourselves, yet how often have we not been told by the inner voice, that to pursue our own interests at the expense of others would be to do wrong!

A: Who has not at one time or other felt a sourness, wrath, selfishness, envy- and pride, which he could not tell what to do with, or how to bear, rising up in him without his consent, casting a blackness over all his thoughts, and then as suddenly going off again, either by the cheerfulness of the sun or air, or some agreeable accident, and again, at times, as suddenly returning upon him? Sufficient indications are these to every man that there is a dark guest within him . . . often lulled to sleep by worldly light and amusements. (Law) 185. Q: So self-observation and self-honesty are the way out of the cave? A : This is the way thou must go. (Bunyan) 186. Q: People come into our lives and they exit from our lives.

A : How much easier it is to live in simplicity, than to be obligated to those who might enrich me. (Sufism) 191. Q: What do the mystics have to say about human humility? I am afraid I have some suspicions here. A: Humility is often only a feigned submission, of which we make use to make others submissive. It is the trickery of pride which abases itself in order to exalt itself, and though it transforms itself in a thousand different ways, it is never better disguised and more capable of deceiving than when it conceals itself under the cloak of humility. (La Rochefoucauld) Learn these facts about human nature 192. Q: What if a person commits a wrong, but says he is sorry about it afterwards. Should we not accept his remorse as fully genuine? A : He will inevitably repeat the offence, or do something similar to it, should the occasion return, even though for the moment he is deep and sincere in his assurances of the contrary. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that a man cannot forget, except himself, his own character. For character is incorrigible, because all a man's actions arise from an inward principle; he must always do the same thing under like circumstances, and he cannot do otherwise. (Schopenhauer) 193. Q: Then how can anyone change his basic nature from bad to good? What is man's way out of himself?

So a man is not free by the name of the Eternal without discerning the Eternal. (Shanka: 195. Q: How would you describe genuine humility? A : It costs us a great deal of trouble not to be of the same opinion as our self-love, and not be too ready to believe in the good taste of those who believe in our merits. (Amiel) 196. Q: Why do cruel people often win great prosperity and public honours, and how do thev get away with their wickedness? A : Does anyone do wrong? h is to himself that he i the wrong.

Only he who acts beneficially towards himself will act so towards others. (Lavater) 201.

A : The deepest and most passionate love is that which survives the extinction of esteem. (Ouida) 203. Q: We have been taught that knowledge of what is truly right is already within us, and when awakened, we need no other authority. What is a specific instance of this? A : The rule for doing unto others as you would wish them to do unto you, calls for no miraculous proof, neither does it require faith, because the rule is convincing in itself, both to reason and to human nature. (Tolstoy) 204. Q: What superior state of mind will be ours when we have completed our needed tasks? A : I am quite my own master, agreeably lodged, perfectly easy in my circumstances. I am contented with my situation, and happy because I think myself so. (Le Sage) 205. Q: So self-conquest automatically includes conquest over our human circumstances, whatever they may be?

Q: The mystics state that there is a great difference between the man who publicly claims to be concerned for others, and the man who lives from the truth in a quiet and natural manner. Have I summarized this particular idea correctly? A: The moral enthusiast, who in the maze of his subdeties, loses or despises the plain paths of honesty and duty, is on the brink of crimes. (Lavater) 208. Q: What special abilities does a mystical-minded man possess? A : His eyes can read men's inmost hearts, and all the art of hypocrites cannot deceive him. His sharp discernment sees things clear and true. (Moliere) 209. Q: And such a man possesses all those virtues and powers we have been discussing, such as deep cosmic knowledge and authentic compassion for wandering man- kind? A: Such men not only liberate themselves; they fill those they meet with a free mind. (Philo) 210. Q: There is far more anger and resentment between people than anyone likes to admit. What information can banish these harmful emotions? A : A physician is not angry at the intemperance of a mad patient, nor does he take it ill to be insulted by a man in a fever. Just so, should a wise man treat all mankind as a physician treats a patient, and look upon it only as sick and irresponsible. (Seneca) 211.

A: Know not what you know. (Plautus) The truth is always with you 212. Q: Is there a tactful and effective way to correct a person who is wrong but cannot see it? A : When we wish to correct with advantage, and to show another that he errs, we must notice from what side he views the matter, for on that side it is usually true, and admit that truth to him, but reveal to him the side on which it is false. He is satisfied with that, for he sees that he was not mistaken, and that he only failed to see all sides. (Pascal) 213. Q: How can we tame the surrounding world? A : It is good to tame the mind. (Buddhism) 214. Q: We are told we must adjust to society, but I am beginning to suspect this advice comes from the maladjusted. Certainly we must seek mental harmony and not try to adjust to hypnotized humanity. A: It is a misfortune to have to manoeuvre one's heart as a general has to manoeuvre his army. (Smith) 215. Q: I often find myself in the conflict of wanting something and not wanting it at the same time, like trying to please someone while wishing I were free of him. Can I rise above this? A : The heart is made to reconcile contradictions. (Hume) 216. Q: Then we can find instant relief from self-battling? A: It is our prerogative as spiritual beings, that we can rise above the feeling of the moment, above all that is isolated and individual. (Caird) 217.

Q: How is a higher truth communicated to receptive minds? A : The pure man . . . has the power of bringing it into a certain state of vibration, which can be conveyed to others, arousing in them a similar vibration. You see that in everyday actions. I am talking to you. What am I trying to do? I am, so to say, bringing my mind to a certain state of vibration, and the more 1 succeed in bringing it to that state, the more you will be affected by what I say. All of you know that the day I am more enthusiastic the more you enjoy the lecture. (Vivekananda) 220. Q: Some of these facts about human nature shock us out of our idealism, which the mystics would no doubt call false idealism. How can these facts be turned into healing? A: Truth is always present; it only needs to lift the iron lids of the mind's eye to read its oracles. (Emerson) 221.

A : Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. (Emerson) 225.

A : What man in his senses abandons that which is good, to keep company with evil? (Clement) 236.

A: They are, in effect, deaf to that internal voice which, nevertheless, calls to them so loud and emphatically. A mere machine is evidently incapable of thinking . . . whereas in man there exists something perpetually prone to expand, and to burst the chains by which it is confined. (Rousseau) 237. Q: I sense the existence of a higher intelligence, but there seems to be a wall between us. How can I attain natural oneness with this greater force? A : Every instrument and tool, if it does that for which it has been made, is well, and yet he who made it is not there. But in things which are put together by nature, there abides in them the power which made them, therefore, the more correct it is to reverence this power.

Can you explain my difficulty to me? A : No man can see over his own height. Let me explain what I mean. You cannot see in another man any more than you have in yourself. Your own level strictly determines the extent to which he comes within your understanding. If your intelligence is unawakened, mental qualities in another, even though they be of the highest kind, will have no effect on you at all . . . his higher mental qualities will no more exist for you than colours exist for those who cannot see.

Q: Recently I read a lecture by one of those rare men who really knows what he is talking about in spiritual matters. One part of me was afraid to accept the strong truths he offered, but another part was immensely attracted to him. Please comment on this. A : When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, one feels within oneself the truth of what one reads. This feeling was there before, although one did not know it. Therefore, one is inclined to love him who makes us feel it, for he has not shown us his own riches, but ours. (Pascal) 255.

A : A man of intellect is like an artist who gives a concert without help from anyone else, playing on a single instrument — perhaps a piano, which is a small orchestra in itself. Such a man is a small world in himself, and the effects produced by various instruments together, he produces all by himself, in the unity of his own consciousness. (Schopen- hauer) 259.

We have been told that the human mind is a powerful and marvellous instrument, yet we see nothing but chaos and heartbreak all around us. What is the answer to this apparent contradiction? A : It is the abuse of our faculties which make us wicked and miserable. Our cares, our anxieties, our griefs, are all owing to ourselves ... If we could be contented with being what we are, we should have no inducement to lament our fate; but we inflict on ourselves a thousand real evils in seeking after an imaginary happiness.

Q: People tell me they wish power to clear their lives of nagging problems, but say they do not know where to start. A : There is a great deal of umapped country within us which would have to be taken into account in explanation of our gusts and storms. (Eliot) 294. Q: Please start us towards exploring this country. A : The first lesson, then, is to sit for some time and let the mind run on. The mind is bubbling up all the time. It is like that monkey jumping about. Let the monkey jump as much as he can; you simply watch and wait. Knowledge is power says the proverb, and that is true. Until you know what the mind is doing you cannot control it. Give it the full length of the reins; many most hideous thoughts may come into it; you will be astonished that it was possible for you to think such thoughts. But you will find that each day the mind's vagaries are becoming less and less violent, that each day it is becoming calmer . . . until at last it will be under perfect control, but we must patiently practise every day.

A : To be a philospher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live, according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. (Thoreau) 299. Q: Please explain how a right mind makes right actions. A : A capacity for self-recollection — from withdrawal from the outward to the inward — is in fact the condition of all noble and useful activity. (Amiel) 300.

A : What greater pleasure is there than to find myself the one thing that I ought to be, and the whole thing that I ought to be? (Suso) 304. Q: I am caught in a mental contradiction, but at least am aware of it. One part of my mind insists that others are responsible for my troubles, while another part tells me to stop blaming others and to see myself as my only problem. What fact can strengthen the right voice? A : No man is damaged by an action which is not his own. (Epictetus) 305. Q: It is strange, but I often feel guilty about enjoying myself, and I have noticed the same feeling in others. I believe it is a false feeling, but what part should enjoyment play in life? A : The highest enjoyment is that of being contented with ourselves. It is in order to deserve this contentment that we are placed here on earth and endowed with liberty. (Rousseau) 306.

(Tauler) 307. Q: Many people pretend to be happy, but are unaware that they are merely playing a role. What is the difference between artificial happiness and true happiness? A: False happiness renders men stern and proud, and that happiness is never communicated. True happiness renders them kind and sensible, and that happiness is always shared. (Montesquieu) 308. Q: It seems that we must have a fondness for what is right. A : For a happy life is joy in the truth. (Augustine) 309. Q: The open or subtle competition between men for power and prestige is an obvious factor in turning life sour. What do men who live in reality say about such competition? A : If two angels were sent down from heaven — one to conduct an empire, and the other to sweep a street — they would feel no inclination to change employments. (Newton) How happiness comes by itself 310. Q: What mental technique might we put into operation for abolishing unhappiness? A : It is most important for anyone who is capable of higher and nobler thoughts to keep his mind from being so completely engrossed with private affairs and ungracious troubles as to let them take up all his attention and crowd out worthier matters, for that is, in a very real sense, to lose sight of the true end of life.

A: Before we passionately desire anything which another enjoys, we should examine into the happiness of its possessor. (La Rochefoucauld) 312. Q: I have difficulty understanding the basic cause of mental and emotional suffering. Will you please explain it as simply as possible? A : We do not content ourselves with the life we have in ourselves and in our own being; we desire to live an imaginary life in the mind of others, and for this purpose we desire to shine. We labour unceasingly to adorn and preserve this imaginary existence, and neglect the real. And if we possess calmness or generosity or truthfulness, we are eager to make it known, so as to attach these virtues to that imaginary existence. (Pascal) 313. Q: So the basic cure is to get at the basic cause. In other words, happiness comes by itself when we cease to live in illusions about ourselves? A : When the imaginary self melts away.

Q: Would you say that growth towards peace consists in making right choices, like choosing to understand our minds instead of choosing to dislike ourselves?

A: Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. (Jesus) 320. Q: We seem to be on a futile march. Our desired happiness recedes before our eyes as we approach it. A : Let each one examine his thoughts, and he will find them all occupied with the past and the future. We scarcely ever think of the present, and if we think of it, it is only to take light from it to arrange the future ... So we never live, but we hope to live; and, as we are always preparing to be happy, it is inevitable we should never be so. (Pascal) 321.

Q: I was recently upset when my plans for moving to a new home were blocked by unexpected circumstances. According to esoteric doctrines, could I have maintained perfect poise in spite of everything? A: The mind is the master over every kind of fortune; it acts in both ways, being the cause of its own happiness and its own misery. (Seneca) 323. Q: Then sadness is merely a wrong state of mind? A: All gloom is but a dream and a shadow . . . cheerfulness is the real truth. (Hawthorne) 324. Q: I am trying to understand more clearly that self-contentment is the only contentment. Will you shed more light on this? A: When I see an anxious man, I say, 'What does this man want?' If he did not want something which is not in his power, how could he be anxious? For this reason, a lute player when he is singing by himself has no anxiety, but when he goes to the theatre, he is anxious, even if he has a good voice and plays well on the lute, for he not only wishes to sing well, but also to obtain applause, which is not in his power. (Epictetus) 325. Q: How do these mystical truths work on us, I mean, how do they change us, what do we become? A: Man is only what he becomes — profound truth, but he becomes only what he is — truth still more profound. (Amiel) 326. Q: Why do so many people fail to discover these profound details about their own deliverance? A: Errors, like straws, upon the surface flow; he who would search for pearls must dive below.

(Byron) 329. Q: What sort of things? A: W T e are the creatures of imagination, passion and self-will, more than of reason, or even of self-interest . . . Even in the common transactions and daily intercourse of life, we are governed by whim, caprice, prejudice or accident. The falling of a teacup puts us out of temper for the day. (Hazlitt) 330. Q: I understand how we must be the architect of our own happiness, but fate constantly thwarts our intentions. A: Happiness lies in the consciousness we have of it, and by no means in the way the future keeps its promises. (Sand) 331. Q: If we could only find a way to make this fact a guiding light in everything that happens to us. A : Courage comes next to prudence as a quality of mind very essential to happiness . . . Our motto should be Wo Surrender', and far from yielding to the ills of life, let us take fresh courage from misfortune . . . Let our attitude be such that we would not quake even if the world fell in ruins about us. (Schopenhauer) 332.

A: Whilst a man seeks good ends, he is strong by the whole strength of nature . . . The perception of this law of laws awakens in the mind a sentiment which we call the religious sentiment, and which makes our highest happiness. Wonderful is its power to charm and to command. It is a mountain air. (Emerson) 334. Q: What is the esoteric definition of happiness? A : A happy life is one which is in accordance with its own nature. (Seneca) 335. Q: If nature is good, why do we suffer from evil? A : There exists no other evil in nature than what you either do or suffer, and you are equally the author of both . . . Particular evil exists only in the sentiment of the suffering being; and this sentiment is not given to man by nature, but is of his own acquisition . . . Take away our errors and our vices . . . take away, in short, even- thing that is the work of man, and all that remains is good. (Rousseau) 336.

Q: Is it correct to say that the more we have of our true self, the less we need other things? A: Few things are needed to make a wise man happy; nothing can make a foolish man content, and that is why- most men are miserable. (La Rochefoucauld) How to banish painful imagination 338.

Q: It is a new but sensible thought to me that the first step towards personal peace is to calmly be aware of our lack of peace. A : The beginning of philosophy to him at least who enters on it in the right way and by the door, is a consciousness of his own weakness and inability about necessary things. (Epictetus) 340. Q: I know that esoteric teachings stress the need for faithful self-examination, but what is its purpose? A : If by patience, if by watching, I can secure one new ray of light, can feel myself elevated . . . shall I not watch ever? (Thoreau) 341. Q: I practise honest self-examination, but am some- times shocked at what I see in myself. A : Truth above all, even when it upsets and over- whelms us! (Amiel) 342. Q: And this begins an entirely new kind of happiness? A : There is no greater delight than to be conscious of sincerity in self-examination. (Mencius) 343.

(Shakespeare) 344. Q: My imagination is constantly running off unhappy scenes from my past. I don't like the strange hold these scenes have on me. A: This pulling out of the imagination which I am recommending, will also forbid us to summon up the memory of past misfortune, to paint a dark picture of the injustice or harm that has been done us, the losses we have sustained, the insults, slights and annoyances to which we have been exposed, for to do that is to arouse fresh life into all those hateful passions long laid asleep — the anger and"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"76 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK. resentment which disturb and pollute our nature.

Q: Esotericism cautions us against getting carried away by excited emotions which masquerade as feelings of joy. Will you please provide an example of legitimate emotions? A: When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence, that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of realitv. This is alwavs exhilarating and - sublime. (Thoreau) 347. Q: My observations of other people reveal how much they suffer from feeling unnoticed and unappreciated. What is the answer to this?

Q: What is the answer to those who feel that life in general has treated them unfairly? A: Nature never deceives us; it is always we who deceive ourselves. (Rousseau) 352. Q: I cannot reconcile the fact of a riotous world with the fact of inner peace. . 1 : The exterior man may be undergoing trials, but the interior man is quite free. (Eckhart) 353.

(Nietzsche) 360. Q: A group of us at the office have been discussing the topic of individual happiness. Will you please supply an idea which I might add to the discussion? A : The greatness and the wretchedness of men are so evident that the true religion must necessarily teach us both that there is in man some great source of greatness, and a great source of wretchedness. It must then give us an explanation of these astonishing contradictions. In order to make man happy, it must prove to him that there is a God, and we ought to love him, that our true happiness is to be in him, and our sole evil to be separated from him. (Pascal) 361.

A : Those who are believed to be the most mild and humble are usually the most ambitious and envious. (Spinoza) 363. Q: Most of us chase frantically around in our attempts to build security, but those men who know what life is all about have a unique leisureliness. How can they afford to be so casual in a flustered world? A : Who stands already on heaven's topmost dome needs not to search for ladders. (Rumi) 364. Q: If we were to meet a man who sees things as they really are, how could we recognize him as such? A : It takes a wise man to discover a wise man. (Xenophanes) 365.

A : We can console ourselves for not having great talents as we console ourselves for not having great places. We can be above both in our hearts. (Vauvenargues) 366. Q: People usually attribute their unhappiness to superficial causes, like lack of money. Will you supply us with a deep and real reason?

Q: I have noticed that many people do not know what is meant by inner strength. Some think that outbursts of emotion indicate personal power. What do vou sav about this?

Q: History proves over and over again that the masses never follow a teacher of genuine strength, at least not for long.

(Schopenhauer) 411. Q: But suppose a man reverses his attitude, I mean, he now prefers to come home to himself, instead of wandering the psychic jungles. I imagine he will now see the strength of a teacher in a new light. A: When we see those whom it inhabits, we are appraised of new degrees of greatness. From that inspiration the man comes back with a changed tone. (Emerson) Be the captain of your own psychic ship! 412. Q: You say that strength must always be solitary, that we cannot gain it from a crowd, but isn't it a sign of power when an organized group marches in unison towards one direction?

Sometimes I am very grateful to others for benefiting me, but at other times I resent them for their benefits. I think I dislike feeling obligated to people.

In analysing my self-invited battles, I find many of them occur because of my loneliness. It drives me into associations with people whom I sense are loaded with concealed cunning and hostility, but I blunder straight ahead anyway. A : Those who have resources within themselves, who can dare to live alone, want friends the least, but, at the same time, best know how to prize them the most. But no company is far preferable to bad, because we are more apt to catch the vices of others than their virtues.

Q: I can see where we can use these ideas in many instances, like overcoming shyness, but I wonder how they might work in an especially tough situation? Just now I am faced with a crisis regarding my love life. A : Philosophy is the art and law of life, and it teaches us what to do in all cases, and, like good marksmen, to hit the target at any distance. (Seneca) 515.

Q: I was once told that I must have as much knowledge about what is wrong as I have knowledge of what is right. Why is it not enough to simply know what is right? A: The knowledge of God without that of man's misery causes pride. The knowledge of man's misery without that of God causes despair. (Pascal) 519. Q: Where do people go wrong in thinking about God, Truth, Reality? A : An idea about God is not God. (Tolstoy) 520. Q: My question is about rewards. While I know we are working for inner benefits, not for material rewards, I sometimes wonder whether I am gaining anything at all. A : There is a third silent party to all our bargains. The nature and soul of things takes on itself the guaranty of the fulfilment of every contract, so that honest service cannot come to loss. If you serve an ungrateful master, serve him the more. Put God in your debt. Every stroke shall be repaid. The longer the payment is withholden, the better for you; for compound interest on compound interest is the rate and usage of this exchequer.

(Amiel) 523. Q: What would indicate that we are really dissolving our problems, instead of merely rearranging them? A: A sound direction is not so much indicated by never making a mistake, as by never repeating it. (Bovee) 524. Q: How do we lose our natural power to solve problems and how can we regain it? A : Every reaction in the form of hatred or evil is so much loss to the mind, and every evil thought or deed or hatred, or any thought of reaction, if it is controlled, will be laid in our favour. It is not that we lose by thus restraining ourselves; we are gaining infinitely more than we suspect ... it is so much good energy stored up in our favour; that piece of energy will be converted into the higher powers.

Q: I wonder whether other people have the same timidity that I have regarding independence? I mean that it sometimes seems frightening to break out of the social net to stand all alone. A: I exist as I am — that is enough; if no other in the world be aware, I sit content. (Whitman) 529. Q: I sense the folly of depending upon others, so would appreciate counsel for breaking away. A: If a man comes to think that I am more dependent upon him than he is dependent upon me, he feels as though I had stolen something from him, and his aim will be to have revenge and get it back. The only way to obtain superiority in dealing with men is to let it be seen that you are independent of them. (Schopenhauer) 530. Q: What do we need to know about self-slavery?

A: Things stand outside us, themselves by themselves, neither knowing anything of themselves, nor expressing any judgment. What is it, then, which makes judgment about them? Your ruling faculty. (Aurelius) 532. Q: What do you mean by personal freedom? A : Is freedom anything else than the power of living as we choose? Nothing else. Tell me then, you men, do you wish to live in error? We do not. No one who lives in error is free. Do you wish to live in fear? Do you wish to live in sorrow? Do you wish to live in tension? By no means. No one who is in a state of fear or sorrow or tension is free, but whoever is delivered from sorrows or fears or anxieties, he is at the same time also delivered from servitude. (Epictetus) 533. Q: You make it clear that freedom is the power to live as we choose, which is an attractive principle. Tell us of a good choice to make right now.

A: Self-control, too, is something which we have in our own power. (Schopenhauer) 536. Q: To me, freedom means freedom from neurosis, unhappiness, and hostility. By this standard, few live in freedom, though everyone claims to love it. A : None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free. (Goethe) 537. Q: Am I correct in defining freedom as an absence of worry and hostility? A: Who then is free? The wise man who can govern himself. (Horace) 538.

A: Hardly one in ten thousand will have the strength of mind to ask himself seriously and earnestly, 'Is that true?' (Schopenhauer) Self-liberty is your natural state 544.

Q: Now that I understand how man preys upon man, I also understand something else, which at first is startling. Society publicly praises individuality and independence, but really fears those who stand on their own feet. A : Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members . . . Self-reliance is its aversion. (Emerson) 550. Q: I want to be a self-directed man. How? A: Eagles fly alone; they are but sheep which always herd together. (Sidney) 551. Q: But isn't it right and necessary to have various kinds of authorities?

Q: I have met a few men who have attained self- command to one degree or another. I have noticed that the higher his level, the less pretence and the more authentic pleasantness.

When, therefore, anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion which provokes you. (Epictetus) Give a wide welcome to higher impressions 555. Q: My first steps away from my old nature must be very short ones, so may I have a suitable thought? A : Our greatest glory consists not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. (Goldsmith) 556. Q: What is our personal responsibility in achieving self-liberty? A: Liberty in submission — what a problem! And yet that is what we must always come back to. (Amiel) 557. Q: May we hear more about this correct and beneficial submission? To what do we submit ourselves? A : Our activity should consist in placing ourselves in a state of susceptibility to Divine impressions, and pliability to all the operations of the Eternal Word. (Guyon) 558.

A : If you are inwardly free from fighting, no one will be able to fight with you. (Taoism) 562. Q: What about those times when we feel battered by the world? A : Truth is tough. It will not break, like a bubble, at a touch . . . you may kick it about all day, like a football, and it will be round and full at evening. (Holmes) 563. Q: I was first attracted to these principles by seeing how easily we can lose those liberties which are based on human plans. Only the spiritual is secure. A : Let me tell you, that as here lies all the true and real freedom, which cannot be taken from you, so in the constant exercise of this freedom, that is, in a continual leaving yourself to, and depending upon the operation of God in your soul, lies all your road to heaven.

Will you please give us a challenging truth to face?

Q: You say that the false must go before the true can come. What particular falseness can we work against in order to find self-release?

Is it because they have more reason? No, because they have more power. (Pascal) Your genuine needs are always supplied 573. Q: Mine is a familiar question about self-independence, but the answer is not so easily found. Is there a method by which I can learn to cast aside my artificial personality traits and to simply be myself? A : A man can be himself only so long as he is alone, and if he does not love solitude, he will not love freedom, for it is only when he is alone that he is really free. Restraint is always present in society, like a companion of whom there is no riddance, and in proportion to the greatness of a man's individuality, it will be hard for him to bear the sacrifices which all contact with others demands. (Schopenhauer) 574. Q: What information could free a man obsessed with the desire to expand his world at the cost of personal peace? A : A man's affections are just as fully satisfied by the smallest circle as they can be by a large circle. (Balzac) 575.

A man must stand straight, and not be kept straight by others. (Aurelius) 581. Q: Please connect self-independence with self- happiness. A : Himself is the source of the best and most a man can be or achieve. The more this is so — the more a man finds his sources of pleasure in himself — the happier he will be . . .

Q: You have explained that we can have a geniune positive attitude, based on reality, or a fictitious positive attitude, based on self-deception. Please comment on a false positiveness. A: The most positive men are the most credulous, since they most believe themselves, and advise most with their falsest flatterer and worst enemy — their own self-love. (Pope) 585.

Q: I have learned that liberty of all kinds is preserved through alertness towards those who would cunningly steal it with gifts.

(Old Testament) 591. Q: Please comment in general on freedom from anger. A : When I am angry my whole mind has become a huge wave of anger. I feel it, see it, handle it, can easily manipulate it, can fight with it, but I shall not succeed perfectly in the fight until I can get down below. A man says something very harsh to me, and I begin to feel that I am getting heated, and he goes on till I am perfectly angry, and forget myself, identify myself with anger. When he first began to abuse me I still thought, T am going to be angry.' Anger was one thing and I was another, but when I became angry, I was anger. These feelings have to be controlled in the germ, the root, in their fine forms, before even we have become conscious that they are acting on us. (Vivekananda) Make internal freedom your goal 592.

They may be severe, they may be prejudiced, they may be determined to see only in one direction, but still in that direction they see clearly. They do not speak all the truth, but they generally speak the truth from one point of view; so far as that goes, attend to them. (Haydon) 596.

(Addison) 606. Q: That helpful information affirms our need for insight into the ways of the mind. A : The price of wisdom is above rubies. (Old Test- ament) 607. Q: How would you describe man's present condition? A : Man does not know in what rank to place himself.

Before meeting esotericism, I would have wanted revenge, but now I wish to use the experience for inner elevation. How? A : How is inner unity even possible under such circumstances? ... To be sure, the best thing he can do is to recognize which part of him smarts the most under defeat, and let it always gain the victory. This he will always be able to do by the use of his reason . . . Let him resolve of his own free will to undergo the pain which the defeat of the other part involves. This is character. (Schopenhauer) 611. Q: What is an example of a man's inner contradiction which punishes him because he fails to see it in himself? A: I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others. (Aurelius) 612.

A : We live in succession, in division, in parts, in particles. Meantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty, to which every part and particle is equally related; the eternal One. (Emerson) 619. Q: I am beginning to see why the sages say that the worst deception is self-deception. Our proud insistence that we are living in a palace is the very fraud that keeps us in the dungeon. A : Nothing is so easy as to deceive one's self, for what we wish to believe, we readily believe, but such expectations are often inconsistent with the real state of things. (Demo- sthenes) 620.

Q: You have said that the thrill that men get by worldly success is always accompanied by feelings of guilt and despair. Why is this? A : Because they cannot hope to rise except by frustrating one another. (Vauvenargues) 622. Q: I don't want to conquer the world; I just want to be contented with myself. A: Remember that the ruling faculty is invincible; when self-collected it is satisfied with itself . . . therefore the mind which is free from passions is a citadel, for man has nothing more secure to which he can fly for safety. (Aurelius) Study your heartache scientifically 623. Q: I am encouraged by a discovery I made in a book of deep wisdom. It said that new life can begin only when the pressure from frustration and despair reaches the cracking point. Does this mean that our cracking is a cracking open, that it is the very exit from our ego-prison? A : It seldom happens that a man changes his life through his habitual reasoning. No matter how fully he may sense the new plans and aims revealed to him by reason, he continues to plod along in the old paths until his life becomes frustrating and unbearable ... he finally makes the change only when his usual life can no longer be tolerated.

Are my two statements correct? A : This is every man's short lesson of life, and he that has well learned it, is scholar enough, and has had all the benefit of a most finished education. (Law) 627. Q: The lessons we have heard so far indicate that we can use our tribulations for self-freedom or for self-imprison- ment, according to the way we handle them. A : Sweet are the uses of adversity. (Shakespeare) 628. Q: What would be a wrong use of suffering? A : It is dangerous to abandon one's self to the luxury of grief, for it deprives one of courage and even the wish for recovery. (Amiel) 629. Q: You seem to say that suffering can be studied scientifically, with profitable results. A : This science is not theoretical, but practical, in which experience surpasses the most polished and clever speculation. (Molinos) 630. Q: Several of us in our study group have been helped by seeing the folly of wasting our time in the social beehive. Will you please make this even clearer to us? A : The social impulse does not rest directly upon the love of people, but upon the fear of solitude. It is not just the charm of having the company of others that people seek; it is the dreary oppression of being alone — the monotony of their own consciousness — that they would avoid. They will do anything to escape it, even put up with bad companions, and tolerate the feeling of restraint which all society involves, which is very burdensome.

A: One should never be very forward in offering spiritual consolations to those in distress. These, to be of any service, must be self-evolved in the first instance. (Coleridge) 633.

A : What is it that any thoughtful, serious men could wish for, but to have a new heart, and a new spirit, free from the hellish self-tormenting elements of selfishness, envy, pride and wrath? (Law) 635. Q: How are our receptive minds affected by the truths and principles we are hearing? A: When the ripe moment comes, the truth within answers to the fact without, as the flower responds to the sun, giving it . . . heat and colour. (Mabie) 636. Q: Does this newness free us from any suffering which others may try to impose upon us?

I know it does no good to feel sorry for myself, so I don't fall into that trap. However, I would like to have the mystical explanation regarding personal loss. A : Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost, no birth, identity, form — no object in the world, nor life, nor any visible thing; appearance must not foil, nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain. Ample are time and space — ample the fields of Nature. (Whitman) 639. Q: How does this inner refreshment actually flow into us when we use grief correctly? Please provide an example. A : When, in some dreadful and ghastly dream, we reach the moment of greatest horror, it awakes us; thereby banishing all the hideous shapes that were born of the night. And life is a dream: when the moment of greatest horror compels us to break it off, the same thing happens. (Thoreau) 640. Q: Suffering is no doubt an excellent teacher, when rightly used, but why do we so seldom use it correctly? A : Few people are wise enough to prefer useful reproof to treacherous praise. (La Rochefoucauld) There is a way out! 641. Q: Teachers like Krishnamurti and George Gurdjieff say that people falsely value their sufferings, which I have noticed in myself. Pains supply a strange excitement, a fiery agitation, which burns up true life. Please verify this.

Q: There seems to be room for the right kind of defiance in the spiritual journey, not the angry kind, but one composed of the will to succeed against all foes. Comment, please. A : Let fortune do her worst, whatever she makes us lose, so long as she never makes us lose our honesty and independence. (Pope) 645.

Will"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"1 34 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! you please supply a method for doing this? A : We would gain more by letting ourselves be seen as we really are, than by attempting to appear what we are not. (La Rochefoucauld) 649.

Q: What can we do about vague fears, I mean, the kind which we hardly recognize, and which seem to have no definite source? A : He who has found the bliss of the Eternal has no fear from any quarter. (Upanishads) 651. Q: One member of our esoteric school suggested a basic practice to employ at all times, but especially with the approach of psychic storm clouds. He suggested that we simply remember that there is a way out, and that it can be found. Your comment, please?

A : Simplicity of character is the natural result of profound thought. (Hazlitt) 655. Q: I have noticed that the sighting of an attractive object of any kind arouses my desire to possess it, which is then followed by the painful realization that I cannot have it. What can I do about this punishing mental process? A : It is proof of great talents to recall the mind from the senses, and to separate thought from habit. (Cicero) 656. Q: I need the help of something above myself. A : The soul's communication of truth is the highest event in nature . . . and this communication is an influx of the Divine Mind into our mind . . . Every moment when the individual feels invaded by it is memorable. (Emerson) 657. Q: But who can know this superior state? A : The man who yearns to know. (Bhagav ad-Git a) 658. Q: Feelings of persecution seem to exist to one degree or another in many people. No doubt this is an unconscious source of suffering, which right thinking can erase.

Please mention one way."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"136 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! A : The world is imprisoned by its own activity. (Hinduism) 661. Q: May I have the full details of this? A : The man who spends his life in sensual acts performs acts that depend upon temporary causes beyond his control. Of himself he does nothing, but it seems to him that he is acting independently. In reality, all that he imagines he is doing by himself is done through him by a higher power; he is not the creator of life but its prisoner. But the man who devotes his life to the recognition and practice of the truth revealed to him unites himself with the source of universal life, and accomplishes not personal or individual acts that depend upon time and space, but acts that have no cause, but are in themselves causes of all else, and have an endless significance. (Tolstoy) 662. Q: What is the foundation of this true action? A : Let your understanding be your action. (Kier- kegaard) The pleasures of your inner journey 663. Q: When it comes to unburdening myself from grief, I am like a man who tries to get rid of a heavy brick by shifting it from his left hand to his right! How can I drop it? A : The being who has attained harmony, and every being may attain it, has found his place in the order of the universe, and represents the divine thought at least as clearly as a flower or a solar system. Harmony seeks nothing outside itself. It is what it ought to be; it is the expression of right, order, law, and truth; it is greater than time, and represents eternity. (Amiel) 664.

A: Most become so only through imitation, and deliberately counterfeit high spirits and cheerfulness. (Vauvenargues) 667. Q: When I look at the unthinking ways of men and women I can see what great patience the mystic masters must possess! A : The work an unknown good man has done is like a vein of water flowing hidden underground, secretly making the ground green. (Carlyle) 668. Q: Why do so many people fail to find happiness? A : All men wish to be happy, but are dull at perceiving exactly what it is that makes life happy. (Seneca) 669. Q: Will you please review and clarify what is necessary for personal peace? A: Happiness is no other than soundness and perfec- tion of the mind. (Aurelius) 670. Q: I would like to mention a pleasant experience I have had with these thoughts. At first I was timid towards them, then curious, then attracted, and finally captivated by their trueness and kindness. A : Mental pleasures never clog; unlike those of the body, they are increased by repetition, approved of by reflection, and strengthened by enjoyment. (Colton) 671.

A : He attains freedom from all worldly cares and anxieties, and nothing can ever chain him again. (Rama- krishna) A clear mind is a treasure 673. Q: You have repeatedly stated that the first step towards freedom is to become aware of self-imprisonment, which I now see as practical wisdom. Please mention one prison cell occupied by unaware people. A: What people will say — in these words there lies the tyranny of the world, the whole destruction of our natural disposition, the uneven vision of our minds. These four words bear sway everywhere.

Lately, I have added another thought to this, which is, I have permitted this blackmail by not living according to honest principles. A : He who floats with the current, who does not guide himself according to higher principles, who has no ideal, no convictions — such a man is ... a thing moved, instead of a living and moving being — an echo, not a voice. The man who has no inner life is a slave of his surroundings, as the barometer is the obedient servant of the air. (Amiel) 675.

Q: I used to suffer intensely in my relations with the opposite sex, which I thought were based in love. But now I am conscious of an esoteric truth which I refused to face for many years, which says that false love quickly turns to hate. My suffering has ended in this area, for which I am grateful, but will you please discuss it? A: Take care how you listen to the voice of the flatterer, who, in return for his little stock of words, expects to gain considerable advantages from you. If one day you do not comply with his wishes, he charges you with two hundred defects, instead of perfections. (Saadi) 678.

A : Keep the imagination sane — that is one of the truest conditions of communion with heaven. (Hawthorne) 679. Q: We want peace with ourselves. Where do we start? A: If we liberate our souls from our petty selves, wish no ill to others, and become clear as a crystal diamond reflecting the light of truth, what a radiant picture will appear in us mirroring things as they are, without the admixture of burning desires, without the distortion of erroneous illusion, without the agitation of clinging and unrest.

Be always a king, and not they, and nothing shall hurt you. (Emerson) 683. Q: A detailed explanation of this would be helpful. A: Fortune does us neither good nor hurt; she only presents us the matter, and the seed, which our soul, more powerfully than she, turns and applies as she best pleases; being the sole cause and sovereign mistress of her own happy or unhappy condition. (Montaigne) 684. Q: Is there a test by which we can know for sure that we are meeting life with cosmic Tightness? A : Touch what you wish with it, and it turns to gold. (Epictetus) 685. Q: In other words, self-change makes everything else all right? A : The partial becomes whole, the crooked becomes straight, the empty becomes full, the worn out becomes new. (Lao-tse) 686.

Q: I have never heard a truth which calls for a greater reverse in my thinking — a healthy reverse, I know. Because of this, will you please review the basic facts about man-made attempts to improve the world? A: However much we have dulled ourselves with hypocrisy, and dulled ourselves with the self-suggestion resulting from hypocrisy, nothing can destroy the absolute certainty of that simple and clear truth that no exterior effort can provide us with security. (Tolstoy) 689. Q: Please explain how self-command provides freedom from exterior pressures and conflicts. A: This external world is but the gross form of the internal, or subtle. The finer is always the cause, and the grosser the effect. So the external world is the effect, and the internal the cause. In the same way external forces are simply the grosser parts, of which the internal forces are the finer. One who has discovered and learned how to manipulate the internal forces will get the whole of nature under his control ... He will be master of the whole of nature, internal and external.

I, therefore, am the seed that is to be freed from all wrappings, and free from all confining shells. (Stirner) 693. Q: Eastern wise men praise the power of non-action, which means to stop trying to force life to bend to our demands. It is certainly a sane course, but I need assurance that nothing is lost by this kind of active non-action. A : When we are doing nothing in particular, it is then that we are living through all our being . . . Will is suspended, but nature and time are always active, and if our life is no longer our work, the work goes on none the less. With us, without us, or in spite of us, our existence travels through its appointed phases. (Amiel) 694. Q: Obviously, the mystic's definition of victory is different from that of most men. What does the mystic mean by triumph? A : My third maxim was to endeavour always to conquer myself rather than fortune, and change my desires rather than the order of the world . . . and thus render me contented. (Descartes) 695. Q: Why must we do individual work to uplift ourselves? Can't an individual trust society for his rescue? A : And run to meet what he would most avoid? (Milton) 696.

A: Simplicity, therefore . . . will contribute to hap- piness . . . Our existence will glide on peacefully like a stream which no waves or whirlpools disturb. (Schopenhauer) 699. Q: It is obvious that human beings are doing something wrong, that we reject our jewels and wear the stones. What self-work can correct us? A : It is the endeavour by the constant exercise of spiritual activity, to appropriate that infinite inheritance of which we are already in possession. (Caird) How to win over all circumstances 700. Q: In reflecting about these matters, I believe that the single greatest power we have is a sensible persistence towards self-awakening.

Q: We speak of the need for character, but it is such a loosely defined term. What is the mystical definition? A : Character is the habit of action from the permanent vision of truth. It carries a superiority to all the accidents of life. It compels right relation to every other man — domesticates itself with strangers and enemies. (Emerson) 706.

Q: You have urged us to distinguish between true morality and false goodness. May we have further aid? A : Morality or the moral life may be described as that solution of the contradiction between man's higher and lower nature which is accomplished by the transformation of the lower into the organ or expression of the higher.

Q: I have heard the teaching about artificiality being the enemy of freedom. Will you please explain it. A : Horses and oxen have four feet. That is natural.

That touch creates us — then we begin to be — thereby we are beings of reality and inheritors of eternity. (Hawthorne) Exterior events have no power over you 730. Q: There seems to be a much deeper meaning to these facts than the mind is able to grasp at first. Can a man's emotions, properly used, help to advance his understanding?

Q: What is a method for winning the self-control necessary for creating exterior betterment? A: It is necessary to study the mind itself, mind studying mind. We know that there is the power of the mind called reflective. I am talking to you; at the same time I am standing aside, as it were, a second person, and knowing and hearing what I am talking. You work and think at the same time, another portion of your mind stands by and sees what you are talking. The powers of the mind should be concentrated and turned back upon itself, and as the darkest places reveal their secrets before the penetrating rays of the sun, so will this concentrated mind penetrate its own innermost secrets ... It will all be revealed to us. (Vive- kananda) 734. Q: The first higher truth I ever learned is still one of the most powerful and helpful forces in my day. It was the truth that self-liberty remains self-liberty, regardless of where the physical man may go. A: Liberty is not in any form of government. It is in the heart of free man; he carries it with him everywhere. (Rousseau) 735. Q: So peace is not a place, but an inner condition!

A: Resign yourself to the sequence of things, forget- ting the changes of life, and you shall enter into the pure, the divine, the One. (Taoism) 737. Q: Part of my mind still insists that exterior events can command my mind to think in a certain way, perhaps to think with pain. What true thought can work against this false thought? A : It is in our power to have no opinion about a thing, and not to be disturbed in our soul, for things themselves have no natural power to form our judgments. (Aurelius) 738. Q: I want these teachings, but my circumstances are opposed to them, for example, most of my friends are absorbed by petty activities. A : It matters little where a man may be at this moment; the point is whether he is growing. (MacDonald) The greatest reward on earth 739. Q: The trouble with most of us is our endless demand for rewards — a greater reward, a vanity-pleasing reward, an exciting reward. A : Reward? Do you seek any greater reward for being a good man than doing what is right and just? . . . Does it seem to you a small and worthless thing to be a good man, and therefore a happy man? (Epictetus) 740. Q: If people were to change inwardly, by receiving the truth, it would make a profound change in our exterior ways of life. What would happen to our ways of earning a living, to our relations with each other, to our medical and scientific programmes? A: They would be different, richer, and higher, but would not at all be discontinued.

He who can see truly in the midst of general infatuation is like a man whose watch keeps good time, when all clocks in the town in which he lives are wrong. He alone knows the right time. (Schopenhauer) 743. Q: Esotericism says that authentic power consists of inner qualities, like self-knowledge and self-command. How does it define false power? A: All violence, all that is dreary and repels, is not power, but the absence of power. (Emerson) 744. Q: Please say more about our ability to handle every kind of event with perfect poise.

If the sailor did not carry with him his own temperature he could not go from the pole to the equator, and remain himself in spite of all. (Amiel) 745. Q: Please show us what you mean by a heroic determination to achieve psychic success. A: I have severed all ties because I seek deliverance. How is it possible for me to return to the world? He who seeks religious truth, which is the highest treasure of all, must leave behind all that can concern him or draw away his attention, and must be bent upon that one goal alone.

A : As the mind is made intelligent, the capacity of the soul for pure enjoyment is proportionately increased. (Wallace) Hear this magnificent message! 748. Q: These are the truths I have been searching for all my life. Now I need preliminary guidance. A: If you want to be an astronomer you must go to the observatory, take a telescope, study the stars and planets, and then you will become an astronomer. Each science must have its own methods. I could preach you thousands of sermons but they would not make you religious, until you first practised the method. These are the truths of the sages of all countries, of all ages, men pure and unselfish, who had no motive but to do good to the world. They all declare that they have found some truth higher than that the senses can bring to us, and they challenge verification. They say to you, take up the method and practise honestly ... So we must work faithfully, using the prescribed methods, and light will come. (Vivekananda) 749. Q: There must be a good reason why we are instructed to go beyond a mere collection of spiritual facts and plunge into a deep and personal experience with the truth. A : A hundred thousand tongues may discourse to you about the sweetness of honey, but you can never have knowledge of it except by taste. (Caussin) 750.

We are, after all, surrounded by personal and international suffering. A : The greater the difficulty, the more glory in surmounting it. Skilful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests. (Epicurus) 814. Q: The habit of self-questioning has been praised by men who have found the way out for themselves. Please show us how a despairing man might phrase his self-inquiry. A: But maybe I have overlooked something, or misunderstood certain ideas. It cannot be possible that this condition of despair is natural to man. (Tolstoy) 815. Q: Why do we so often miss the upward steps? A : Why did you not look for the steps? (Bunyan) 816. Q: You have stated that esotericism reverses our thinking. I now see what you mean. Where we formerly sought praise and admiration, we now see through it. A : In whatever way people may praise us, they never teach us anything new. (La Rochefoucauld) 817. Q: What obstacles in general must we overcome? A: Delusions, errors, and lies are like huge, gaudy vessels, the timbers of which are faulty, and those who embark on them are asking to be shipwrecked. (Buddha) How to make all events harmless 818. Q: You have urged us to observe these facts in our daily contacts with others, which I have done. I have a friend whose life centres around the collection of beautiful objects — paintings, furniture, flowers, and so on, yet she has no beauty of mind or spirit. This proves that the outer can add nothing to the inner. A : Though we travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us or we find it not.

Q: I have the bad habit of trying to force people and events to conform to my personal wishes, which usually backfires against me. What esoteric lesson can help me blend with events, instead of fighting them? A : Leave all things to take their natural course, and do not interfere. (Lao-tse) 820. Q: I am aware of the need for honestly facing myself as I actually am, but find it more challenging than I first supposed. Is there something you can offer as aid? A: It is therefore exceeding good and beneficial to us to discover this dark, disordered fire of our soul, because when rightly known and rightly dealt with, it can as well be the foundation of heaven. (Law) 821. Q: So is it good to see the bad? A: The natural man in us flinches, but the better self submits. (Amiel) 822. Q: How might we more clearly see the necessity for following this new way? A : Have the past struggles succeeded? (Whitman) 823. Q: Please show us how a faulty attitude leads to painful consequences. A : I have tried to make friends by corporeal gifts, but have only made enemies. I never made friends but by spiritual gifts. (Blake) 824. Q: People use negative attitudes the same way they use weapons. We seem to think it necessary to battle our way forwards with all sorts of offensive weapons, like anger and pretence. Since they are harmful to both others and ourselves, why do they form a part of our nature? A: None of these things should be called a man's, which do not belong to a man, as man. They are not required of a man, nor does man's nature promise them, nor are they the means of man's nature attaining its goal.

A : Don't be a cynic, and bewail and bemoan. Omit the negative propositions. Don't waste yourself in rejection, nor bark against the bad, but chant the beauty of the good. (Emerson) 826. Q: What is a major obstacle to self-contentment? A : All the various ideas that arise making us believe that we require something external to make us happy are obstructions to that perfection. (Vivekananda) The rules for a beautiful life 827. Q: Some of the Eastern teachings, like Zen, teach that obstacles exist only in our confused imagination. How would you say the same thing? A : There is no one who hinders you from always doing and saying the things which are according to the nature of which you are a part. (Aurelius) 828. Q: What prevents us from acquiring these truths as personal possessions? A : What we do not understand we do not possess. (Goethe) 829. Q: May we have an example of a self-punishing attitude towards spiritual matters? A : Those who do not love the truth take as a pretext that it is disputed, and that a multitude deny it. And so their error arises only from the fact that they do not love either truth or charity. (Pascal) 830.

A : Let us live happily, then, free from all ailments among the ailing! Among men who are ailing, let us dwell free from ailments! (Buddhism) 832. Q: You have pointed out that we fall into trouble because of our inability to recognize trouble when we sight it. So consciousness must be the certain solution to all problems. A : Every one who is in good can perceive evil; and he who is in truth can see falsity . . . Those whose under- standings are in light from wisdom are like men who at mid-day are standing upon a mountain and seeing clearly all that is below. (Swedenborg) 833.

Q: What is meant by living simply and wisely? A : Every nature is contented with itself when it goes on its way well, and a rational nature goes on its way well, when in its thoughts it consents to nothing false . . . and when it is satisfied with everything that is assigned to it by the common nature. (Aurelius) 838. Q: My work as a salesman of office equipment gives me contact with dozens of executives and businessmen every week. I have noticed that one of their chief characteristics is nervousness. Could an executive living in these truths do his work with total ease and calmness? A : His thought is quiet, his words and deeds are quiet, when he has won freedom by true knowledge. (Buddhism) 839. Q: I can see why inner freedom is everything. We must refuse to be captured by the surrounding social swindle, which passes for decency. A : A horse which is harnessed to a wagon along with other horses is not free . . .

How can we know this other way, this really triumphant way, of which you speak? A : We need only obey. There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening we shall hear the right word. (Emerson) 842. Q: Then obedience to truth, to our original nature, makes the difference between a right and a wrong life? A: Obedience ensures greatness, while disobedience leads to defeat. (Saadi) 843. Q: If I understand correctly, this obedience frees us of our own prison bars of egotism and self-righteousness? A : Obedience is, indeed, founded on a kind of freedom, else it would become mere subjugation. (Ruskin) 844. Q: I am very fond of the principle that the truth is the most powerful force in the universe. Since it is helpful in a practical way, and also encouraging, will you please go into it? A: Argument may be overcome by stronger argument, and force by greater force, but truth and force have no relation — nothing in common by which the one can act upon the other. They dwell apart, and will continue to do so. (Pascal) 845. Q: So this is what makes everything easy for a person living in truth, in spite of a violent world?

Q: How can I cure my anxiety over being separated from familiar things which give me a sense of security? A : Diogenes was free. How so? Not because he was of free parentage, for that was not the case, but because he was himself a free man. He had cast aside every handle by which he might be enslaved . . . All things sat loosely upon him, all things were attached by slender ties. (Epictetus) 847. Q: What prevents us from living at ease with ourselves? A : No man can, for any considerable time, wear one face to himself, and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which is the true one. (Hawthorne) 848. Q: May I state my desire as simply as possible? I wish to be an entirely different kind of a person. A : From this difference between the new and the old man, which is a difference as real as that between heaven and earth, several lessons of great instruction may be learned. (Law) 849. Q: What kind of real differences will we know? A : If men knew what felicity dwells in the cottage of a godly man, how sound he sleeps, how quiet his rest, how composed his mind, how free from care, how easy his position . . . how joyful his heart, they would never admire the noises, the diseases, the throngs of passions, and the violence of unnatural appetites that fill the house of the luxurious and the heart of the ambitious.

A : Humility may be taken for granted as existing in every sane human being, but it may be that it most truly manifests itself today in the readiness with which we bow to new truths as they come from the scholars, the teachers, to whom the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding. (Holmes) 852. Q: Once we have heard and welcomed a new truth, what next? A : Be like the pearl oyster. There is a pretty Indian fable to the effect that if it rains when the star Svati is in the ascendant, and a drop of rain falls into an oyster, that drop will become a pearl. The oysters know this, so they come to the surface when that star shines, and wait to catch the precious raindrop. When one falls into the shell, quickly the oyster closes it and dives down to the bottom of the sea, there to patiently develop the drop into the pearl. We should be like that. First hear, then understand, and then, leaving all distractions, shut our minds to outside influences, and devote ourselves to developing the truth within us. (Vivekananda) 853.

A: Where there is honey, there are bees. (Plautus) How to win the good life 855. Q: The mystics teach that happiness comes to us of itself, effortlessly, as we make ourselves inwardly right. Will you please explain what brings about this easy kind of contentment? A: The sovereign good of man is a mind that subjects"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"THE PATH TO EASY AND NATURAL LIVING 1 75 all things to itself, and is itself subject to nothing. Such a man's pleasures are modest and reserved, and it may be a question whether he goes to heaven or heaven comes to him. (Seneca) 856. Q: In simple language, please tell us how to attain the good life. A: Truth is the source of every good thing in heaven and on earth. He who expects to be blessed and fortunate in this world should be a partaker of truth. (Plato) 857. Q: But how can we determine what is truly good, when there are hundreds of contradictory opinions? What is considered a good act in one country is an unlawful act in another. A : The answer to the last appeal of what is right lies within a man's own heart. Trust yourself. (Aristotle) 858. Q: Placing my confidence in exterior guides has brought me nothing but grief, so self-trust must be the only way out. A : How easy it is to repel and to clear away every impression which is troublesome or unsuitable, and immedi- ately to be in all tranquillity. (Aurelius) 859. Q: All this brightness and happiness can surround us even while we carry on with our daily duties in this frantic world? A: The world is overcome, yes, even here! (Bhagavad- Gita) 860. Q: The mystics warn us against practising false goodness. What is an example of this? A : We easily pardon in our friends those faults which do not affect our own interests. (La Rochefoucauld) 861.

For example, is it possible to find steadfast restfulness in self-knowledge? A : That which I know immediately and intuitively transcends in certitude all other knowledge, for the certainty of it is bound up with the mind's certainty of itself. I can no more doubt what I thus know than I can doubt my own existence. (Caird) 862. Q: Please recommend a way to make our daily activities as efficient and as easy as possible. A : Beware of dissipating your powers; strive constantly to concentrate them. (Goethe) 863. Q: I recently read that most people are unaware of how they waste their energies by indulging in useless and endless talking. Please comment. A : The first virtue is to restrain the tongue. He approaches nearest to the gods who knows how to be silent, even though he is in the right. (Cato) 864. Q: What an interesting idea! Up to now I had never thought of silence as a method for learning. A: Study to be quiet. (New Testament) True strength is effortless 865. Q: The mystics teach that the Higher Power causes all events to happen. Since this is so, how can we fall into harmony with natural events? A: We ought not to lead events, but to follow them. (Epictetus) 866. Q: I sense something magnificent about the blending of ourselves with events. It must certainly end all conflict. A : At this elevation, there is no effort, no struggle. (Suso) 867.

(Emerson) 868. Q: If I could just get it deeply enough into my mind that I am both the cause and the cure of my own conditions, I would be inspired to elevate my inner state. Do you have a statement for making me feel this fact more strongly? A: We make for ourselves, in truth, our own spiritual world, our own monsters, chimeras, angels — we make objective what ferments in us . . . We reward ourselves and punish ourselves without knowing it, so that all appears to change when we change. (Amiel) 869. Q: I have given myself the task of learning everything possible about a particular human condition, for example, I now see that an angry person is a frightened person. May I have a new condition for investigation? A : The freer you feel yourself in the presence of another, the more free is he. (Lavater) 870. Q: One of the most helpful thoughts I ever heard was that the truth never needs to defend itself. I now see that our immersion in truth makes anxious self-defence completely unnecessary. A : Truth is as impossible to be soiled by any outward touch as the sunbeam. (Milton) 871. Q: I often feel that I owe something for my bad behaviour in past years, but you say this is false guilt. A : Come, there is no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time. (Shakespeare) 872. Q: What prevents so many people from receiving the needed information about the easy way? A: To speak and to offend, with some people, are but one and the same thing. (La Bruyere) 873.

How does this come about? A : Just as by the telescope and the microscope we can increase the scope of our vision, and make higher or lower vibrations cognizable to us, similarly, every man can bring himself to the state of vibration belonging to the next plane, thus enabling himself to see what is going on there. ( Yivekananda) 8 74. Q: And what is going on? A: It is the Way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it knows how to overcome; not to speak, and yet it knows how to win a response. (Lao-tse) A fascinating fact about happiness 875. Q: Please remind us of a basic principle, which we may have neglected, but which calls for renewed study. A : The notion of cause is deeply rooted in every human mind. It is a universal idea, for all men have it. It is a necessary idea, for we cannot help having it, even if we deny its existence. It probably arises first in the mind on the occasion of our making an effort and seeing some result follow. (Clarke) 876. Q: How can we cease to produce negative causes and replace them with positive causes? A : All that is required to produce it is simply the consciousness of what is in any measure greater than ourselves — the consciousness at each stage of our progress, that something lies beyond us. (Caird) 8 77. Q: Am I correct in seeing our task as ridding ourselves of blockage and contradiction, after which natural harmony and happiness flow by themselves? 1 Pleasure is the reflex of unimpeded energy.

He is the man who cannot suffer injury, who cannot be hindered or compelled, whose impulses are not blocked, whose desires attain their purpose, who does not fall into whatever he wishes to avoid . . . So, no wicked man lives like this, and so he is not free. (Epictetus) 879. Q: Please supply a first step towards personal newness. A: Man's life begins only with the appearance of rational consciousness. (Tolstoy) 880. Q: An acquaintance of mine remarked that he saw no need to work on himself when things were going smoothly. What is your reaction to this statement? A : It is wretched business to be digging a well just as thirst is conquering you. (Plautus) 881. Q: You often remark that man has everything exactly backwards from the way it is in reality. Will you reveal one such area needing our correction? A: Man does not wish ... to come out of spiritual servitude into spiritual liberty, for the reason, first, that he does not know what spiritual servitude is and what spiritual liberty is; he does not possess the truths that teach this; and without truths, spiritual servitude is believed to be freedom, and spiritual freedom to be servitude. (Swedenborg) 882. Q: What knowledge can lift the servitude of being led astray by others? A : A man often fancies that he guides himself, when he is actually guided by other people, and while his mind aims at one objective, his heart insensibly draws him towards another.

Will my over-all studies develop this? A: There is not only comfort and the ease of a burden brought to us by the sight and consideration of these, but an endeared affection. (Bunyan) 892. Q: We are told to examine exciting thoughts, and to not accept them as necessarily accurate. Why? A : Because by so doing we incur the danger of being seduced, by mistaking our own imagination or perhaps natural inclination for the divine light. (Baker) 893. Q: Some friends and I have been studying a particular idea, stressed by Emerson, which is the enmity of society to individual freedom. Please add to our knowledge. A: Culture, far from giving us freedom, only develops as it advances, new necessities; the fetters of the physical close more tightly around us, so that the fear of loss quenches even the ardent impulse towards improvement, and the maxims of passive obedience are held to be the highest wisdom of life.

A : Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? (Thoreau) 898. Q: Am I correct in concluding that self-study, while at first challenging, turns out to be the easy road after all? A : When, by analysing his own mind, man comes face to face, as it were, with something which is never destroyed, something which is, by its own nature, eternally pure and perfect, he will no more be miserable, no more unhappy. All misery comes from fear, from unsatisfied desire . . . When he knows that he is perfect, he will have no more vain desires, and both these causes being absent, there will be no more misery — there will be perfect bliss, even while in this body.

If we become inwardly real, do our necessary daily duties become easy? A : All natural results are spontaneous. The diamond sparkles without effort, and the flowers open impulsively beneath the summer rain. And true religion is a spontaneous thing — as natural as it is to weep, to love, or to rejoice.

A : Nothing so much prevents our being natural as the desire of appearing so. (La Rochefoucauld) 910. Q: I have been helped by your advice to not tie myself to either the past or the future.

(Baker) 918. Q: Why do the mystic masters caution us against superficial belief, and urge us to get the facts? A: Everyone believes in virtue, but who is virtuous? (Balzac)"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"SOLVE THESE MYSTERIES AND ENRICH YOURSELF 1 87 919. Q: Can you give us something which will explain and reduce our fears of exploring the unknown? This is my major roadblock. A: Our life is like a journey in which, as we advance, the landscape takes a different view from that which is presented at first, and changes again, as we come nearer. This is just what happens, especially with our desires. We often find something else, no, something better than what we were looking for . . . Instead of finding, as we expected, pleasure, happiness, joy, we get experience, insight, knowledge — a real and permanent blessing, instead of a disappearing and illusory one. In their search for gold, the alchemists dis- covered other things — gunpowder, china, medicines, the laws of nature. There is a sense in which we are all alchemists. (Schopenhauer) 920. Q: But doesn't this discovery require great inner power? A: Do the thing and you shall have the power; but they who do not do the thing have not the power. (Emerson) 921. Q: You have rightly stated that most men and women are quickly offended by the slightest thwarting of their desires. Does the entrance of these principles give us a more mature mind? A : Great peace have they which love thy law; and nothing shall offend them. (Old Testament) 922. Q: I have completed a work project which you suggested, with interesting results. You advised me to see that I knew almost nothing about certain ideas of psychology on which I prided myself. I now see that many of us are like a hobo who discusses the stock market.

Mystic principles are understandable 923. Q: How can we recognize true spiritual principles when we see them? A : The principles of this authentic religion are entirely natural to man, so that the instant they are communicated to him they are received as ideas long familiar and self-evident . . . These principles are quite simple, understandable, and few in number. (Tolstoy) 924. Q: What is the explanation of all the cruelties and stupidities which often masquerade as religion? A : If we subject everything to reason, our religion will have nothing mysterious or supernatural. If we violate the principles of reason, our religion will be absurd and ridicu- lous. (Pascal) 925. Q: I can now see how the realistic principles of mysticism lead to mental health. A : The root of sanctity is sanity. A man must be healthy before he can be holy. We bathe first, and then perfume. (Swetchine) 926. Q: How do you explain the persecution of genuinely good men, like Jesus and Socrates and Eckhart? A : However evil men may be, they dare not appear to be enemies of truth, so when they persecute it, they pretend to believe that it is error, or say it is capable of crimes. (La Rochefoucauld) 927. Q: What are the characteristics of a person who makes self-transformation the first order of business in his life? A : He reads much; he is a great observer, and he looks quite through the deeds of men. (Shakespeare) 928. Q: How is an enlightened man unlike other people?

A : All powerful souls have kindred with each other. (Coleridge) 931. Q: What makes a mystic master the spiritual power that he is? What special effort has he made, what unique victory has he won which is a signpost for us? A : The true critic strives for a clear vision of things as they are ... his effort is to get free from himself, so that he may in no way distort that which he wishes to understand or reproduce. His superiority to the common herd lies in this effort . . . He distrusts his own senses, he sifts his own impressions, by returning upon them from different sides and at different times, by comparing, moderating, shading, distinguishing, and so endeavouring to approach more and more nearly to the formula which represents the maximum of truth. (Amiel) 932. Q: Some people use idealistic ideas as a means of hiding from their everyday responsibilities. What advice do they need? A: Be a. philosopher, but amidst all your philosophy, be still a man. (Hume) The truth about an esoteric school 933. Q: What is truth? A: Truth is the agreement of the mind with itself. (Plotinus) 934. Q: In other words, truth is the absence of self- contradiction?

(Pascal) 935. Q: Suppose we were fortunate enough to find a school of esoteric philosophy. What would it be like? How would it differ from common organizations which profess to help people? A: A philosopher's school is a hospital. You should feel discomfort, not pleasure, in it, for on entering, no one is well and whole. One has a disjointed shoulder, another a wound, a third suffers from a cut, and a fourth has a headache. Am I then to sit down and give you a treat of pretty words and empty sentiments, so you may applaud me and depart, with neither shoulder nor wound, cut nor headache, any better for your visit? (Epictetus) 936. Q: Would it be correct to compare esoteric schooling with the school of our childhood, for example, by learning to spell short words we are qualified to work on longer ones? A: Now understand me well -- it is provided in the essence of things that from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come forth something to make a greater struggle necessary . . . the road is before us! It is safe ... I have tried it. (Whitman) 937. Q: Since esoteric truths are available to all who really want them, why does mankind remain in its miserable state? A : Great truths do not take hold of the hearts of the masses. (Chuang-tse) 938. Q: What a strange situation! Man is shipwrecked on a desert island, and not only refuses to climb into the rescue ship sent for him, but throws stones at his rescuers. A : We are accustomed to see men scorn what they do not understand, and snarl at the good and the beautiful because it lies beyond their sympathies. (Goethe) 939.

(Swift) 940. Q: You say that a person of strong self-will has no conscience, and is therefore a danger to himself and to others. Please explain. A : Self-will is so ardent and active that it will break a world to pieces to make a stool to sit on. (Cecil) 941. Q: A friend of mine is aware of his self-blocking, but sees no way out. A : There is one direction in which all space is open to him. He has faculties silently inviting him thither to endless exertion. He is like a ship in a river; he runs against obstructions on every side but one, on that side all obstruction is taken away and he sweeps serenely over a deepening channel into an infinite sea. (Emerson) How gain comes through loss 942. Q: The men and women in my study group find it helpful to hear the same truth repeated in different ways, so may we have your explanation of why the average person feels nervous and unhappy? A : Not satisfied with the needs of nature, he demands the unneccessary. (Schiller) 943. Q: Please expand that thought. A : All the ills of mankind appear, according to Lao-tse, not from man's neglect of the necessary, but because he does what is unnecessary. If men would practise what Lao-tse calls non-action, they would be free not only of their personal difficulties, but also of those residing in every form of government. (Tolstoy) 944.

Q: Please help us solve the mystery of mental freedom. A : I call that mind free which is not passively framed by outward circumstances, which is not swept away by the torrent of events, which is not the creature of accidental impulse, but which bends events to its own improvement, and acts from an inward spring, from immutable principles which it has deliberately espoused. (Channing) 946. Q: You teach that with the loss of false values we also lose fear. What does that mean? A: The man with an empty purse can sing before the robber. (Juvenal) 947. Q: Will you please explain what is meant by psychic deafness? What prevents us from receiving healthy words and impressions? A: Talkative people listen to no one, for they are ever speaking. And the first evil surrounding those who do not know the meaning of silence is that they hear nothing. (Plutarch) 948. Q: If you have some especially strong medicine, we are ready for the cure. A : Have you again forgotten? Don't you know that a good man does nothing for the sake of appearances, only for the sake of what is right? (Epictetus) 949. Q: What is the explanation of human cruelty? A : Fear is the parent of cruelty. (Froude) 950. Q: By what means can we recognize an authentic teaching?

Q: I would like assistance in understanding what you mean by false happiness, plus a technique for avoiding it. A : A political victory, a rise in rents, the recovery of your sick or the return of your absent friend, or some other favourable event raises your spirits, and you think good days are preparing for you. Do not believe it. Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles. (Emerson) You can escape the human jungle 952. Q: It would help me to understand a peculiar feature about worldly success. Once we win a certain goal, like wealth or popularity, it loses its great charm, and we feel as empty as before. Why is this? A: Ambition becomes displeasing once it is satisfied; there is a reaction. Our spirit endlessly aims towards some object, then falls back on itself, having nothing else on which to rest, and having reached the summit, it longs to descend. (Corneille) 953. Q: We can never hear enough about the need for using our own energies for our own progress towards happiness. A : The only elevation of a human being consists in the exercise, growth, energy of the higher principles and powers of his soul. A bird may be shot upwards to the skies by a foreign force; but it rises, in the true sense of the word, only when it spreads its own wings and soars by its own living power. (Channing) 954.

Q: As a student of psychology, I would like to know why a hard-hearted person is always the most easily fooled by false promises of friendship and love? A: The less tenderness a man has in his nature, the more he requires it from others. (Rahel) 958. Q: It appears that what human beings call love is merely the exchanging of mutual benefits or the hope of gaining personal rewards. Is that an accurate conclusion? A: He alone knows what love is who loves without hope. (Schiller) 959. Q: I try to choose a better way for myself, I really make an effort to select truth over falsehood, Tightness over wrongness, love over hate, but my choice has no power behind it. I guess you would say I have no will power whatsoever. So if I cannot even choose Tightness and succeed in my choice, how can I ever rescue myself? A : You have no freedom or power of will to assume any holy temper, or take hold of such degrees of goodness, as you have a mind to have . . . But you have a true and full freedom of will and choice, either to leave and give up your helpless self to the operation of God on your soul . . . This is the truth of the freedom of your will.

Q: You have made us aware of how we all ask questions based in illusion, for example, we ask whether this or that human method will stop wars. It is illusory because we answer the question and then start a new war. What right question can begin to wake us up? A : The question at stake is no common one. It is, 'Are we in our right sense or are we not?' (Epictetus) 962. Q: That is what we really want — to be sane, sensible, unpretentious men and woman. However, our own negative nature deceives us into thinking this to be impossible. Show us how to challenge this false counsel. A : This power demands of us what alone is certain and rational and possible . . . which is possible only in the truth, and, therefore, in the recognition of the truth revealed to us, and the profession of that truth. (Tolstoy) 963. Q: By personal experience I know that it is a thousand times easier to find a religious charlatan than to find a man who truly knows what life is all about. Why is it like this? A : It is natural for great minds — the true teachers of humanity — to care little about the constant company of others, just as little as the schoolmaster cares for joining in the frolic of the noisy crowd of boys which surrounds him. The mission of these great minds is to guide mankind over the sea of error to the harbour of truth, to draw men back from the dark abyss of barbarous crudeness into the light of culture and refinement. Men of superior intellect live in the world without really belonging to it . . . they let no one approach them who is not in some degree freed from the prevailing crudeness. (Schopenhauer) 964.

A: Philosophy is a modest profession; it is all reality and plain dealing. I dislike solemnity and pretence, with nothing but pride behind it. (Pliny) 966. O: I would like an example of what you mean by self-damaging self-deception. A : The usual excuse of those who hurt others is that they do it for their own good.

(Heraclitus) 968. 0: I finally see what you mean by courageously discarding the false as a means of finding the true.

A : When the heart weeps for what it has lost, the spirit laughs for what it has found. (Sufism) The secret of unlimited energy 969. Q: Since the universe is unlimited energy, and we are one with the universe, we can never lose by letting go and :ig of natural goodness. Is that a correct summary?

Q: May we have some general information about the various impulses and urges which cause us to act for good or bad?

It goes throughout with men — throughout the mind, throughout the members, throughout the motions of the whole life. (Alleine) 982.

The principal point was that a man must begin to doubt the Tightness of his ways if he is ever to see the light. This connects with the idea that man is unaware of his psychic sleep.

Our average man has but to make a conscious effort and ask himself, 'Is not all this an illusion?' in order to feel like an awakened sleeper, trans- ported from a hypocritical and horrible nightmare-world into a living, peaceful, and joyous world of reality.

And when I reached this source of light I was dazzled with the splendour, and I found there full answers to my questions as to the purpose of the lives of myself and others. (Tolstoy) 1015. Q: How can we qualify ourselves for self-trans- formation? A : This great, good light and comfort is inwardly revealed only to those who are . . . inwardly illuminated, and who know how to dwell inwardly with themselves. (Tauler) Dare to cross the river! 1016. Q: As a first principle of self-work, I have determined to never protect a false position I discover in myself, but to let it be replaced by whatever is truly right. A : Your setting out is good, for you have given credit to the truth. (Bunyan) 1017. Q: May we hear more about the need for abandoning our old and burdensome ideas? How would an enlightened man explain it? A : He compares the world to a dry, scorched, and barren wilderness, and celestial happiness to a most delicious paradise, divided from this desert by a deep and tempestuous river, which must necessarily be passed by swimming. The securest way to pass over this river is by quitting one's clothes; but few there are that have the courage to expose themselves to the injuries of the weather for a while, and therefore adventure over . . . Some few others (such are religious persons) seeing this danger, take a good resolution to divest themselves of their clothes, and to make themselves lighter and nimbler by casting away all impediments.

A : When a man tells you that you know nothing, and you are not angry at him, you may be sure that you have begun to work. (Epictetus) 1020. Q: After some intense self-investigation, I now see why we must remain on our own grounds, and not lend ourselves out to others. A : He who builds upon another man's ground, loses his mortar and his stone. (Cahier) 1021. Q: May we hear of a spiritual practice for use when meeting trouble of any kind? A : Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. (New Testament) 1022. Q: Please identify a specific evil or mistake. A : Despair is the greatest of our errors. (Vauvenargues) 1023. Q: I am certainly in error with other people. I appear to be at ease with others, but underneath I feel that the smallest wrong word on my part will cause an explosion between us. I would like esotericism to work for me in this area. A : That is no reason for despair. You need not fancy it is impossible to regulate your life in accordance with abstract ideas and maxims . . . the first thing to do is to understand the rule; the second thing is to learn the practice of it. The theory may be understood at once by an effort of reason, and yet the practice of it acquired only in the course of time. (Schopenhauer) 1024. Q: I am now aware of a major problem to overcome.

Q: If we were shockingly aware of how little of ourselves we actually possess, would that change things? A : There is no thought in any mind, but it quickly tends to convert itself into a power, and organizes a huge instrumentality of means. (Emerson) 1027. Q: Please explain the values of a clear and alert mind. A : All that a man does outwardly is but the expression and completion of his inward thought. To work effectually, he must think clearly; to act nobly, he must think nobly. Intellectual force is a principal element of the soul's life, and should be proposed by every man as the principal end of his being. (Channing) 1028. Q: We are timid towards new ideas because they threaten our comfortable misery. What a test! We must plunge into the storm if we are to come out on its other side. A : Thinkers are as scarce as gold, but he whose thoughts embrace all his subject, and who pursues it uninterruptedly and without fear of consequences, is a diamond of enormous size. (Lavater) 1029. Q: How can we maintain inner correctness and not get carried away by the mad rush of the world we must face daily? A : Be sincere with yourself.

A : Every great mind seeks to labour for eternity. All men are captivated by immediate advantage; great minds alone are excited by the prospect of distant good. (Schiller) 1031. Q: How can we become more gentle to others, especially to those who cause us grief? A : It is only imperfection that complains of what is imperfect. The more perfect we are, the more gentle and quiet we become towards the defects of others. (Fenelon) 1032. Q: Since self-honesty is a first principle of mysticism, let me speak my mind. I am tired of having others tell me what to do, what to think, what to believe, and what to follow. I want to follow myself, but I need more infor- mation. A: A simple and independent mind does not toil at the bidding of any prince. (Thoreau) 1033. Q: I used to wrongly think that to be good meant to do things we really did not want to do, but now I see it means to do what is truly right for us. With this in mind, how can we benefit ourselves with more healthy goodness? A: Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, Tt will not benefit me.' As by the falling of raindrops ajar of water is filled, so the wise man becomes full of good, even though he collects it little by little. (Buddha) 1034.

A: To sum up all in a word: Nothing has separated us from God but our own will, or rather our own will is our separation from God. All the disorder and corruption, and malady of our nature, lies in a certain fixedness of our own will, imagination, and desires, wherein we live to ourselves, are our own centre and circumference, act wholly from ourselves, according to our own will, imagination and desires. There is not the smallest degree of evil in us, but what arises from this selfishness, because we are thus all in all to ourselves. (Law) 1036. Q: It would be heaven on earth if we could harmonize our own will with what actually happens to us. Can it be done? A : If a thing is difficult to be accomplished by you, do not think that it is impossible for man, but if anything is possible for men and conformable to his nature, think that this can be attained by yourself, too. (Aurelius) 1037. Q: What is the specific process for winning this harmony? A: We must follow, not force Providence. (Shake- speare) 1038. Q: And this provides a totally new life in the here and now? A : The true heaven is everywhere, even in the very place where you stand and go. (Boehme) 1039. Q: I do not understand why the mystics say that a favourable change in exterior circumstances has no corrective effect on a person's internal state. A : The seed of the oak produces oaks, and is never converted by circumstances into a beech tree. (Lotze) 1040.

(Schiller) 1041. Q: It would help me understand my past mistakes better if you would expand on this thought. Are you saying that every attempt of a man to prove himself only increases his self-doubt? A: He destroys his health by the pains he takes to preserve it. (Virgil) 1042. Q: Looking around at the frantic world, it seems that very few human beings understand this fact. A : People of passionate temperament never understand this . . . They can only be impressed by acts and effects, by noise and effort. They have no instinct of contemplation, no sense of the pure cause, the fixed source of all movement, the principle of all effect, the centre of all light, which does not need to spend itself in order to be sure of its own wealth, nor to throw itself into violent motion to be certain of its own power. (Amiel) 1043. Q: We are instructed to observe and dismiss wrong feelings. Please expose one of them which we may be unconsciously hiding. A : The worst kind of shame is being ashamed of frugality or poverty. (Livy) A great mystical truth 1044. Q: The trouble with everything we have tried in the past is that it simply does not work. In spite of both individual effort and social planning, we are still bewildered. A : We must approach this matter in an entirely different manner.

(Emerson) 1046. Q: What is a basic difference between a wise individual and an unaware person? A : The wise man recognizes the idea of the Good within him. (Plotinus) 1047. Q: Up until a short time ago I had not appreciated these true teachers and teachings. How can I speed up my appreciation? A : In proportion as our own mind is enlarged, we discover a greater number of men of originality. Common- place people see no difference between one man and another. (Pascal) 1048. O: My main difficulty in achieving a better life is lack of clear knowledge of the way. I have tried all sorts of systems, but end up just as confused as before. Are there definite steps which anyone can take to transform his life? A: True, there are, by the direction of the Lawgiver, certain good and substantial steps, placed even through the very midst of this Slough . . . these steps are hardly seen . . . notwithstanding the steps be there; but the ground is good when they are once got in at the Gate.

By honesty I mean the seeing of himself as being one with the whole of the universe, and not as a separate ego which must battle with other egos. A : An honest heart possesses a kingdom. (Seneca) 1051. O: I am trying to see the difference between human power and power residing in union with spiritual principles. I believe it is accurate to say that spiritual power has none of the public screaming and general insanity we see in the news. A : Power rests in tranquillity. (Cecil) 1052.

O: It is incredible how asleep I have been to my own self-splitting. How will self-healing make things different? A : All who have conscience say whatever they say from the heart, and do whatever they do from the heart; for not having a divided mind they speak and act according to what they understand and believe to be true and good. (Swedenborg) 1054. Q: So we must refuse to compromise, we must choose genuine self-change over the mere appearance of goodness? A : Men. attached by habit to the existing order, shrink from attempting to change it, therefore they agree to consider this doctrine as a mass of revelations and laws that may be accepted without making any change in one's life: whereas the doctrine .... is not a doctrine of rules for men to obey, but unfolds a new life-conception, meant as a guide for men who are now entering upon a new life, one entirely different from the past.

A: I have given you the refreshing drink called the perception of truth, and he who drinks of it becomes free from excitement, passion, and wrong-doing. (Buddha) 1057. Q: A friend of mine is becoming more and more interested in higher truth, but has trouble understanding why his progress is so slow. What might I tell him? A: When a farmer is irrigating his field the water is already in the canals, only there are gates which keep the water in. The farmer opens these gates, and the water flows in by itself, by the law of gravitation. So, all human progress and power are already in everything; this perfection is every man's nature, only it is barred in and prevented from taking its proper course. If anyone can take the bar off, in rushes nature. Then the man attains the powers which are his already. (Vivekananda) 1058. Q: Then our happiness depends upon how much we permit ourselves to be our real selves? A : We make for ourselves, in truth, our own spiritual world. (Amiel) 1059. Q: Suppose a man reaches the point where he sees, at least dimly, the anger and the terror and the frustration he has concealed so long from himself and others. Suppose his suffering has also given him a glimpse of the light at the exit of his cave. What forward step can he take? A : It is time to undervalue what he has valued, to dispossess himself of what he has acquired, and with Caesar to take in his hand the army, the empire and Cleopatra, and say, 'All these will I relinquish, if you will show me the fountains of the Nile.'

(Southey) 1062. Q: What is a common way in which people abuse their natural powers? A: To pursue trifles is the lot of humanity; and whether we bustle in a pantomime or strut at a coronation, whether we shout at a bonfire or harangue in a senate-house — whatever object we follow, it will at last surely conduct us to futility and disappointment. (Goldsmith) 1063. Q: You seem to be saying that we beat upon a thousand exciting drums in a frantic attempt to drown out the noise of our own pains.

Q: Some people like the kind of power that tyrannizes and hurts other people. This is obviously false and evil power, based on deceitful appearances, and backed up by the lunatic mob. What is true power? A: Power obeys reality, and not appearances; power is according to quality, and not quantity. (Emerson) 1067. Q: Sometimes we get so involved with our own thinking that we forget the simplest of rules for successful living. Please remind us of one. A : We should not act and speak as if we were asleep. (Aurelius) 1068. Q: Esotericism teaches that men dwell in a peculiar state of spiritual sleep, while dreaming that they are awake. What information can begin to shake us awake? A : Reality surpasses imagination, and we see breathing, brightening and moving before our eyes some sights dearer to our hearts than any we ever beheld in the land of sleep. (Goethe) 1069. Q: My husband and I would appreciate having an exercise we can work out together. A: Every night we should call ourselves to account: 'What weakness have I overcome today? What passions opposed?

Q: You have said that many of these ideas may seem negative at first, but turn out to be the very map to the treasure. Will you please cite an instance of this? A : The precept, 'Know yourself was not solely intended to abolish the pride of men, but also that we might understand our own value. (Cicero) 1072. Q: The talent for turning negative impulses into constructive forces seems like true magic to me. It would be valuable, for example, to turn a strong feeling of persecution into the feeling that there is truly another way to live. A : Strong impulses are but another name for energy. Energy may be turned to bad uses, but more good may always be made of an energetic nature, than of an indolent and impassive one. (Mill) 1073.

Q: How can we release our psychic forces in the shortest possible time? A : The greatest loss of time is delay and expectation, which depends upon the future. We let go of the present, which we have in our power, and look forward to that which depends upon chance — and so relinquish a certainty for an uncertainty. (Seneca) 1078.

The soul is in her native realm; and it is wider than space, older than time, wide as hope, rich as love.

Q: Why do many people, including ourselves, hesitate to explore beyond our present boundaries of life? A: Narrowness of mind is the cause of obstinacy — we do not easily believe what is beyond our sight. (La Rochefoucauld) llll.Q: But why should people change their minds? It is supposed to be noble to stand by one's convictions. A : Stubbornness is not firmness. (Schiller) 1112. Q: I realize the need for giving these wisdoms an opportunity to change me in a new way. How can I do so? A: It is love that asks, that seeks, that knocks, that"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"226 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! finds, and that is faithful to what it finds. (Augustine) 1113. Q: Sometimes we feel that the only good things are those we can see or touch. What is the answer to this misleading temptation? A : The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched. (Thoreau) 1114. Q: All of us sense that whatever is natural is always right and healthy, so please tell us how to recognize both the natural and the unnatural. A : Where there is much pretence, much has been borrowed — nature never pretends. (Lavater) 1115. Q: I find it helpful to see our inner forces as servants which work for us silently and efficiently. A : Untwisting all the chains that tie the hidden soul of harmony. (Milton) Absorb these vital facts about life 1116. Q: Of the hundreds of interesting facts we have un- covered, one of the most surprising is man's immersion in illusions about his identity. He falsely thinks he has a sepa- rate self, with separate self-wisdom and self-control, instead of seeing that he lives in Cosmic Oneness, in Universal Mind. Please confirm this. A : Nothing is more hidden from us than the illusion which lives with us day by day, and our greatest illusion is to believe that we are what we think ourselves to be. (Amicl) 1117. Q: What is meant by Universal Mind? A : There is one mind common to all individual men. Every man is an inlet to the same and to all of the same. He that is once admitted to the right of reason is made a freeman of the whole estate. What Plato has thought, he may think;"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"HOW TO SWIFTLY AWAKEN YOUR HIDDEN POWERS 227 what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has befallen any man, he can understand. Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and sovereign agent. (Emerson) 1118. Q: Your teaching about the Oneness of man with his universe is both practical and fascinating. How might a scientist explain it? A : There is no man alone, because every man is a microcosm, and carries the whole world about him. (Browne) 1119. Q: I once heard a most interesting remark at a lecture. The speaker said that the greater the neurosis, the greater can be the swing over to the side of mental health, providing the individual works hard on himself. Where might this swing to sanity start? A: If you are content with the old world, try to pre- serve it; it is sick . . . But if you can no longer live in the eternal conflict between your convictions and life, thinking one way and acting another, take it upon yourselves to leave the shelter of the pale and ruinous arches. (Herzen) 1120. Q: This calls for a personal declaration of freedom. A : It is time to explain myself — let us stand up. (Whitman) 1121. Q: I want to leave the disastrous battleground of society, but need more power than I now possess. A : How great is the power of truth! Of its own power it can easily defend itself against all the ingenuity of cunning and wisdom of men, and against the treacherous plots of all the world. (Cicero) 1 122. Q: What fundamental understanding can establish us in new powers in the most efficient manner? A: Men have but to understand this: they must cease to care for material and external matters ... let them apply one hundredth part of the energy now used by them in out-"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"228 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! ward concerns to those in which they are free — to the recog- nition and profession of the truth that confronts them, to the deliverance of themselves and others from the falsehoods which conceal the truth. Then the false system of life which now torments us, which threatens us with still greater suffer- ing, will be destroyed at once without struggle, then the Kingdom of Heaven, at least in that first stage . . . will be established. (Tolstoy) The way out of the wilderness 1123. Q: Please explain the difference between a receptive mind and a gullible mind. A : There is an old simile in India that if you place a cup of milk before a Raja Hamsa (swan) with plenty of water in it, he will take all the milk and leave the water. In that way we should take what is of value in knowledge, and leave the dross. (Vivekananda) 1124. Q: My study has revealed a definite connection between self-responsibility and self -happiness. A : To be happy means to be self-sufficient. (Aristotle) 1125. Q: My aim is to toss aside everything useless, and to cut a straight path through the mental wilderness, to break out into clear ground. Will you provide a way? A : Many have puzzled themselves about the origin of evil. I am content to observe that there is evil, and that there is a way to escape from it; and with this I begin and end. (Newton) 1126. Q: It is unfortunately true that many of us are like forged paintings; we look good, but are often valueless. What original values can we reclaim? A : How are we constituted by Nature? To be free, to be noble, to be modest. (Epictetus) 1127. Q: You have said that a truly spiritual man has a certain indifference about him, which radiates itself as"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"HOW TO SWIFTLY AWAKEN YOUR HIDDEN POWERS 229 strength. What is an example? A : The only way to get the confidence of the world is to show the world that you do not want their confidence. (Haydon) 1128. Q: Is it better for us to stick to one authentic teacher or to see what all of them have to say? A : Does not a bee gather honey out of many flowers? (Boehme) 1129. Q: I am gradually awakening to the need to break out of my self-centred World, and also sense the power to do it. Apparently, an authentic need creates the very capacity for fulfilling the need. A : The first breath of spiritual life is indeed, in one sense, the realization of this capacity, but in another sense, it is only the beginning of a realization which is itself incapable of limitation . . . we have in us the power to transcend the bounds of our narrow individuality, and to find ourselves in that which seems to lie beyond us. (Caird) 1130.Q: My best achievement up to now is to clearly see that there are a thousand reasons for wrestling with these ideas and not one good reason for ignoring them. A: Pure gold! (Blake) Profitable principles in summary a. Every person possesses a storehouse of hidden power. b. As our deeper mind awakens, our sleeping energies emerge. c. Every unhappy event can be used to discover new powers. d. Place a supreme value on all these principles. e. Awareness of a negativity provides power over it. /. Nothing can prevent you from becoming a new person. g. Look in an entirely new direction for a refreshed life! h. Take very good care of your spiritual prosperity. i.

Q: I am a far more frightened person than 1 appear to be before others. How can I dissolve my fears? A : If men who do not understand life would only approach nearer to the phantoms which alarm them, and would examine them, they would see that they are only phantoms, and not realities. (Tolstoy) 1132. Q: I feel depressed because I am unable to correct all the mistakes I have made. .4 : Do not cumber yourself with fruitless pains to mend and remedy remote effects; let the soul be erect, and all things will go well. (Emerson) 1133.Q: Please make us aware of a negative influence we should guard against. A : Let not that which in another is contrary to nature be an evil to you, for you are not made by nature to be depressed with others, nor to be unhappy with others, but to be happy with them.

To be awake is to be alive . . . We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn. (Thoreau) 1136. Q: We are unable to get to the point about anything, especially our problems. How can we live simply, directly, without fuss and without discussion? A: A cucumber is bitter? Throw it away. There are briars in the road? Turn aside from them. This is enough. Do not add, 'Why were such things made in the world?' (Aurelius) 1137. Q: So a main problem is our own mental wanderings! A: W f e must get rid of all this nonsense. (Kierkegaard) 1138. Q: May we have a specific instance of wasteful thinking? A: The individual fears ridicule above all things, and ridicule is the certain result of originality. No one, therefore, wishes to make a pa^ty of his own; everyone wishes to be on the side of all the world. (Amiel) 1 139. Q: Please provide a basic fact about genuine happiness. A : The happiness we receive from ourselves is greater than that which we obtain from our surroundings. (Metro- dorus) 1140. Q: It is sometimes discouraging to see how many things we do not know. A: The only useful question in this matter is this: how a man may know that he is in the way of regeneration, that he is spiritually alive, and growing in the inward and new man.

A: Whether we are in a pleasant or a painful state depends, finally, upon the kind of matter that pervades and engrosses our consciousness. (Schopenhauer) 1142.

Q: We have been advised to root out fear in order to love and be loved. Please explain. A: No man loves the man whom he fears. (Aristotle) 1144. Q: Authentic love conquers all things, including fear and trembling? A: There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear. (New Testament) 1145. Q: It is said that psychic power is altogether different from the power of human authority. Will you please clarify? A: The man who fears nothing is as powerful as he who is feared by everybody. (Schiller) 1146. Q: Much of our enthusiasm is like a boomerang that falls back to strike us as depression. Please provide us with an enthusiasm that goes places. A: I pray thee, O God, that 1 may be beautiful within. (Socrates) 1147. Q: I feel a particular kind of frustration. For years I have tried to succeed by imitating the methods of people who have already won their objectives. I sometimes hope that tomorrow will be the turning point, but another part of me senses that I am going about it all wrong.

It is a certain air which distinguishes us, and seems to destine us for great things; it is a price which we set upon ourselves. (La Rochefoucauld) 1149. Q: And this sets us free of the anxiety involved in wanting things from others? A : I care not so much what I am in the opinion of others, as what I am in my own. I would be rich of myself, and not by borrowing. (Montaigne) 1 150. Q: I wonder whether I can express my problem clearly. My mind takes over and forces me to think stupid and useless thoughts. I am like a man swept along by a raging river, battered and miserable, with no way out. Do you understand my condition? A : Man is so made that by continually telling him he is a fool he believes it, and by continually telling it to himself he makes himself believe it. For man holds an inward talk with himself, which it pays him to regulate . . . We must keep silent as much as possible, and talk with ourselves only of God, whom we know to be true, and thus we convince our- selves of the truth. (Pascal) Have no anxiety over results 1151. Q: Our study group is at present exploring false escapes from fear and tension. I believe you include most social activities as a wrong route. A : 1 have said that people are rendered sociable by their inability to endure solitude, that is to say, their own society. They become sick of themselves. Their mind is wanting in flexibility; it has no movement of its own, so they try to give it some — by drink, for instance . . . They are always looking for some form of excitement, of the stron kind they can bear — the excitement of being with people ol like nature with themselves; and if they Fail in this, theii mind sinks by its own weight, and they fall into grievous lethargy.

Q: What is the matter with people who constantly chase from one place to another, from one activity to the next, in a vain attempt to find satisfaction? A : They see not good so near. (Pythagoras) 1153. Q: Why do we fail to see how easily we are fooled by the outer world? A : Oh, the difficulty of fixing the attention of men on the world within them! (Coleridge) 1 154. Q: What idea can fix our attention on our inner riches? A: Why do you look without for that which is within you? (Eckhart) 1155. Q: I would appreciate having a thought to call upon whenever I feel discouraged over my self-work. A : Nothing is more delightful than the light of truth. (Cicero) 1156. Q: What truth would help a person who feels he has failed to be a success in his career or work? A : Nature has not said to me, 'Be not poor,' still less, 'Be rich.' She calls out to me, 'Be independent!' (Chamfort) 1157. Q: What does a man gain by following this counsel? A : He is independent of everybody and everything. Always do your duty, but without attachment to it. That is how a man reaches ultimate truth — by working without anxiety about results. (Hinduism) 1158. Q: There is a certain fear which many people never speak about, probably because they are unaware of it. What is your comment on the fear of being alone?

If you are true, but not in the same truth with me, cleave to your own companions; I will seek my own. I do this not selfishly but humbly and truly. It is alike your interest, and mine, and all men's, how- ever long we have dwelt in lies, to live in truth. Does this sound harsh today? You will soon love what is dictated by your nature as well as mine, and if we follow the truth it will bring us out safe at last. (Emerson) 1 160. Q: Can we really escape our anxieties? A : Like birds escaped from the net. (Buddhism) How to be free of all fears 1161. Q: Sometimes I feel like a man adrift in a boat in a foggy sea. I don't know where I am going or what is happen- ing to me. A : Fear not . . . there is no danger for you. There is a way to cross over the ocean of the world, and by this way the wise men have reached the shore. This same way I point out to you, for it is the way to destroy the world's fear. Crossing the ocean of the world by this way, you will win perfect peace. (Shankara) 1162. Q: In a single sentence, why does humanity go from one disaster to another? A : If you are surprised at the number of our maladies, count our cooks. (Seneca) 1163. Q: But public leaders seem so sure of themselves. A: Nothing is so firmly believed as what we least know.

A : If a foolish man is associated with a wise man, even all his life, the foolish man will understand truth as little as a spoon understands the taste of soup. (Buddhism) 1170. Q: The mystics point out that unenlightened man i* split into dozens of separate and contradictory parts which battle endlessly with each other. Observation proves the truth of this.

All that is clearly due today is not to lie. (Emerson) Be your own good fortune! 1172. Q: As all oi i-s know by experience, the truth seems frightening, but at the same time it is the only force capable of banishing fear. Will you go into this? A : A little boy wearing the mask of a lion looks quite fierce. He runs out where his little sister is playing and shrieks out in a horrible voice, which shocks and terrifies his sister, making her cry out in terror, and making her attempt to escape from the frightening creature. But when her brother takes off his mask, she runs back to exclaim, 'It is my nice brother after all!' (Ramakrishna) 1173. Q: I am apprehensive that others won't like me. A : From a distance it is something; nearby it is nothing. (La Fontaine) 1174. Q: How can I quickly recover from an upset or a depression? A : When you have been compelled by circumstances to be disturbed in any manner, quickly return to yourself, and do not continue out of tune longer than the compulsion lasts. You will have increasing control over your own harmony by continually returning to it. (Aurelius) 1175. Q: What can create self-encouragement?

Q: Please point out a cause of anxiety of which we may be unaware. A: We often try to banish the gloom and despondency of the present by speculating upon our chances of success in the future; a process which leads us to invent a great many unreal hopes. Every one of them contains the seed of illusion, and disappointment is inevitable when our hopes are shat- tered. (Schopenhauer) 1177. Q: You say that man lives almost entirely in flattering self-pictures of being good, rather than in the genuine article. This would seem to be a major cause of tension, for he must endlessly try to protect his illusory images. A : That virtue which requires to be ever guarded is scarcely worth the sentinel. (Goldsmith) 1178. Q: I have been both startled and helped by realizing how much we live from unrealistic self-pictures of ourselves. How would you describe a man living like this? A : The slave and prisoner of his own opinion of him- self. (Thoreau) 1179. Q: Please show us how to be free from the chains of opinion. A : I call that mind free which protects itself against the usurpations of society, which does not cower to human opinion, which feels itself accountable to a higher tribunal than man's, which respects itself too much to be the slave or tool of the many or the few. (Channing) 1180. Q: You have said that the man who knows the truth from himself has no need for frantic belief.

(Whitman) How to erase secret faults 1182. Q: I feel myself capable of winning this new life, but at the same time I possess secret faults which threaten to rise up and expose me. This frustrates my efforts. A: Let nothing, therefore, deter a well minded soul from persevering with fervour in this firm resolution. No, not the sight of her daily defect, imperfections, or sins, or remorses for them; but rather let her increase in courage even from her falls, and from the experience of her own impotency let her be incited to run more earnestly . . . she will be enabled to do all things and conquer all resistances.

A : He who asks of life nothing but the improvement of his own nature, and a continuous good progress towards inner contentment and spiritual submission, is less likely than anyone else to miss and waste life.

Q: We could use detailed advice for not compromising, for standing up for ourselves in the right way. A : The characteristic of heroism is its persistency. All men have wandering impulses, fits and starts . . . But when you have chosen your part, abide by it, and do not weakly try to reconcile yourself with the world.

I hope something can be done about this uncomfortable condition. A: The man who is just and resolute will not be moved from his settled purpose, either by the misdirected rage of his fellow citizens, or by the threats of an imperious tyrant.

(Aurelius) 1193. Q: You teach that inner dawning comes only after we have been disillusioned, when we start to doubt our tradition- al beliefs, and when we have lost our supposed securities. Will you please review this? A : To understand things we must have been once in them and then have come out of them; so that first there must be captivity and then deliverance, illusion followed by disillusion, enthusiasm by disappointment. He who is still under the spell, and he who has never felt the spell, are equally incompetent. We only know well what we have first believed, then judged. To understand we must be free, yet not have been always free. (Amiel) 1194. Q: What happens to a man as a result of this experience? A : How changed from him whom we knew! (Virgil) 1195. Q: I have collected and studied mystical books for twenty years. There is a definite difference and superiority in them, unlike anything found in books of ordinary religion and psychology. W r hat causes the difference? A : If a book comes from the heart, it will contrive to reach other hearts. (Carlyle) 1196.

They feel then their nothingness without knowing it . . . If our condition were truly happy, we would not need diversion. (Pascal) 1197. Q: If diversion fails, what succeeds? A : Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me. (Whitman) 1198. Q: What is the cause of suddenly finding ourselves in trouble? A : The cause is sleep or forgetfulness: some sleep when they should keep awake, and some forget when they should remember. And this is the very cause why often at the resting-places some pilgrims, in some things, come off losers. Pilgrims should watch, and remember what they have already received. (Bunyan) 1199.

(Plotinus) The truth is a solid rock 1200. Q: Please comment on right and wrong attitudes to- wards these principles. A : It is clear that the first step in the new birth is a reception of truths by the understanding, and the second is the will to act in accordance with truths, and finally to practise them. No one, however, can be said to be reformed by mere knowledge of truth; for man is able to acquire these and to talk about, teach, and preach them . . . But he is a reformed man who has an affection for truth for the sake of truth. (Swedenborg) 1201.

Q: You teach that self-knowledge and cosmic know- ledge dissolve all conflict, but I can't get over the notion that I must fight fiercely against a hostile world. A : Cast away your opinion and you are saved. Who hinders you from casting it away? (Aurelius) 1203. Q: Nothing is clearer to me than that the man who masquerades as a policeman will be afraid of meeting a real policeman. I want to drop pretence and be a real person, which I believe is a right desire. A : Now this is nothing else but the superior light giving light to the understanding, so that the human understanding becomes divine, made one with the divine. (Yepes) 1204. Q: And this oneness is the same as love? A : Egotism erects its centre in itself; love places it out of itself in the axis of the universal whole. Love aims at unity, egotism at solitude. Love is the citizen ruler of a flou- rishing republic, egotism is a despot in a devastated land. (Schiller) 1205. Q: We are afraid because we seem so small when com- pared to the mighty universe. A : What frightens you? Stand then and be free. If the sun come down, the moons crumble into dust, systems after systems are hurled into annihilation, what is that to you? Stand as a rock; you are indestructible ... so break this chain and be free for ever. What frightens you, what holds you down? It is only ignorance and delusion; nothing else can bind you . . .

A : I may be asked what I mean by Inward Spiritual Freedom . . .

If there are two rascals among them, they will recognize each other quickly, as if each wore a similar badge, and they will at once conspire for some selfishness or treachery ...

Please provide an example of these two points. A: So long, therefore, as we are not agitated by pas- sions which are contrary to our nature, so long is the power of the soul by which it seeks to understand things not impeded; and so long, therefore, has it the power of forming clear and distinct ideas.

A : Great men are they who see that spiritual is stronger than any material force, that thoughts rule the world. (Emerson) Esotericism provides true mental health 1246. Q: When we see public authorities squabbling with each other from opposite corners, it is apparent that most human beings do not really understand what life is all about. How can an individual seeker refuse all this childishness and advance to a conscious perception of life? A : The worst of human errors spring in most cases from the fact that men who stand on a low intellectual level, when they encounter events of a higher order, instead of trying to rise to the higher level from which these events can be rightly viewed, and making an effort to understand them, judge them by their own low standards, and the less they know of what they speak, the more arrogant and fixed are their judgments. (Tolstoy) 1247. Q: I notice how you repeatedly urge us to work for a clear and an understanding mind. Please start us in the right direction. A : Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things arc pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

A : A hero must not allow himself to be outwardly bound; he must resist everything by his inward strength. (Auerbach) 1257.

A: There is nothing more flattering than the bare truth, boldly uttered; but, all the same, those who can bear it are the rare exceptions in human nature. (Swetchine) 1305. Q: Why do we resist our healing medicine? A : Truth is too simple for us; we do not like those who unmask our illusions. (Emerson) 1306. Q: I wonder whether I have drawn a correct conclusion from all this? Do we really owe nothing to a sick society except personal maturity and decency? A : I do not give lectures or a little charity, when I give I give myself. (Whitman) 1307. Q: If only we could see this! What a relief from false guilt! A: Who has hired you as a nurse to this sick society? (Tolstoy) 1308. Q: I am amazed at my first glimpse of a particular truth, which came as a faint flash, as you predicted it would. I am now starting to realize that the evil and cruelty of other people are, in reality, absolutely powerless to touch us. A : Do they cast us out of the city? They cannot cast us out of that which is in the heavens. If they who hate us could do this, they would be doing something real against us. So long, however, as they cannot do this, they are but pelting us with drops of water or striking us with the wind. (Nazianzen) 1309. Q: It is delightful how the truth changes us! Since studying mystical teachings I have completely reversed my idea of what it means to be a great person. A : The happy only are the truly great. (Young) 1310. Q: I have noticed that the more I study the more I want to study."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"MYSTIC GOOD NEWS FOR YOUR DAILY SUCCESS 265 A: The criterion of true beauty is that it increases on examination, of false, that it lessens. (Greville) 1311. Q: I view esoteric teachings as a vast sea, upon which we must bravely dare the voyage. What is the good news for whoever sails all the way to the other side? A: Nothing can trouble him more, nothing can move him, for he has cut all the thousand cords of will which hold us bound to the world . . . as desire, fear, envy, anger, drag us here and there in constant pain. He now looks back smiling and at rest on the delusions of the world, which once were able to move and agonize his spirit also. (Schopenhauer) 1312. Q: Can I personally achieve all this? A : If self to self be true. (Calderon de la Barca) Discover your inner miracle 1313. Q: Unless you have something to give other people, they seem cold and indifferent. I don't mean this as a com- plaint, but as a fact proven by personal experience. Obviously, only this new life of esoteric experience can deliver us from cold conditions. A: Come near to this fire and you will soon be more than warm enough. (Terence) 1314. Q: But must we not give credit to society for trying to make it a warmer world through the administration of justice? A: Love of justice in most men is only the fear of suffering from injustice. (La Rochefoucauld) 1315. Q: I have been helped enormously by hearing you say we must never be offended by the truth, no matter how badly it shakes our cherished beliefs about ourselves. A: The courage of truth is the first qualification lor philosophic studies. (Hegel)"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"266 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! 1316. Q: I notice that the authentic mystics have nothing to do with sensational psychic events, which attract crowds, and which are often praised as miracles. They prefer to speak of the miracle of a changed inner life. Please comment. A : Miracles are within us — natural facts which some call supernormal. (Balzac) 1317. Q: 1 think we all sense that an inner change to psychic health is all that really counts. A : The only miracle that can truly be called a miracle. (Buddha) 1318. Q: A teacher stated that all forms of shame and dis- grace are abolished through esoteric training. What did he mean? A : What is natural is never disgraceful. (Euripides) 1319. Q: So often we find ourselves in the wrong place doing the wrong thing. I would like to know something about find- ing our rightful place in life. A : A true man never frets about his place in the world, but just slides into it by the gravitation of his nature, and swings there as easily as a star. (Chapin) 1320. Q: With personal trueness we find ourselves where we should be, so now we must know how to become true. A : Paradise is still in the world, but man is not in Paradise unless he is born again of God; in that case he stands in his new birth. (Boehme) 1321. Q: As I understand it, esotericism teaches two main points — man is enslaved, but can free himself. Will you review these? A : We are free only so far as we are not dupes of ourselves, our pretexts, our instincts, our temperament. We are freed by energy and the critical spirit — that is to say, by detachment of soul, by self-government. So that we are en- slaved, but susceptible of freedom; we are bound, but capable"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"MYSTIC GOOD NEWS FOR YOUR DAILY SUCCESS 267 of shaking off our bonds. (Amiel) How truth becomes your own truth 1322. Q: For more effective self -work, I would like to con- firm a point. We hear the truth when it calls, but must then overcome our fault of hesitation, and answer the truth in the affirmative. Is that correct? A : Man stands in strict connection with a higher fact never yet manifested. There is power over and behind us, and we are the channels of its communications . . . This open channel to the highest life is the first and last reality, so subtle, so quiet, yet so tenacious, that although I have never expressed the truth, and although I have never heard the expression of it from any other, I know that the whole truth is here for me. (Emerson) 1323. Q: I have been remarkably stimulated by these ideas to ask questions I have never asked before. Perhaps this is a sign of self-awakening. A : Inspiration must find answering inspiration. (Alcott) 1324. Q: May we have a helpful fact about self-trans- formation? A: The man himself must become other than he was if he wants to comprehend truth — must become as true as truth itself. (Stirner) 1325. Q: From all we have heard, we need not make detailed plans for starting towards the richer life; we need only start whenever we like. A: The hour is not past. Why will you put off your resolution? Arise, begin this very moment, and say, 'Now is the time to do: now is the time to fight, now is the proper time for amendment.' (Kempis) 1326. Q: I believe it is correct to say that the teachings of mysticism and esotericism are open to all who truly want"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"268 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! self-liberty, to all who want to know for sure what life is all about. A : It is the religion of universal inspiration. (Hinduism) 1327. Q: It is satisfying to know that these higher principles are available to all who really want them. A : Like truths of science waiting to be caught. (Ten- nyson) 1328. Q: A group of us are now aware of how we were led down false spiritual paths, but also realize that our gullibility was our own fault. We want to be right,not seem right. A: One ounce of the practice of righteousness and of spiritual self-realization outweighs tons and tons of frothy talk and nonsensical sentiments. Show us one, but one, gigantic spiritual genius growing out of all this dry dust of ignorance and fanaticism . . . open the windows of your hearts to the clear light of truth, and sit like children at the feet of those who know what they are talking about . . . Let us then listen attentively to what they say. (Vivekananda) 1329. Q: Please give us a message from their higher world. A: With thinking we may be beside ourselves in a sane sense. By a conscious effort of the mind we can stand aloof from actions and their consequences, and all things, good and bad, go by us like a torrent. (Thoreau) 1330. Q: I am encouraged by realizing the existence of a few sell -liberated individuals who can show us the way. A : Really great minds seem to have . . . dissipated the clouds which concealed the heaven from our view, and they thus disclose to themselves and to us a clear and blissful world of everlasting repose. (Richter) Accept this magnificent invitation 1331. Q: In discussing self-change with friends, I find that many of them arc deeply discouraged over their faults. They"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"MYSTIC GOOD NEWS FOR YOUR DAILY SUCCESS 269 feel that their hostilities and deceits are too deeply rooted to ever be pulled out and replaced with flowers. A : Never let us be discouraged with ourselves. It is not when we are conscious of our faults that we are the most wicked, on the contrary, we are less so. We see by a brighter light, and let us remember for our consolation, that we never perceive our sins till we begin to cure them. (Fenelon) 1332. Q: What common weakness is removed by self- exploration? A : Individual character is in the right that is in strict consistence with itself. Self-contradiction is the onlv wrong. (Schiller) 1333. Q: Then absence of self-contradiction means the presence of mental prosperity and genuine goodness? A : Virtue is, like health, the harmony of the whole man. (Carlyle) 1334. Q: Then psychic health includes insight into the individual mind — its motives, its aspirations, its powers. A : Who knows the mind has the kev to all things else. (Alcott) 1335. Q: What is an example of a self-harming goal in a man? A : To be recognized by the world for that which he had chosen as his idea of himself . . . recognizing him as the genius he must contrive to believe himself. (MacDonald) 1336. Q: The mystics say we have given ourselves false identi- ties, that we tensely live from memorized selves, from which we must free ourselves. Please explain this. .1:1 call that mind free which resists bondage of habit, which does not mechanically repeat itself and copy the p which does not live on its old virtues, which does not enslave itself to precise rules, but which forgets what is behind, listens for new and higher monitions of conscience, and rejoices to pour itself forth in fresh and higher exertions. (Channing)"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"270 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! 1337. Q: Your teachings have freed me from the strain and the folly of trying to imitate goodness. I now see the differ- ence between acting good and being good. A : Rejoice in being yourself a beautiful work of nature, and help yourself to further growth; that's the best thing. (Auerbach) 1338. Q: I think I finally see where we go wrong in our spiritual building. We try to compromise, we try to build a castle on ground which is at present occupied by a haunted house, which is an impossible task. Am I correct in believing that our first task is to clear the ground by giving up our precious nonsense? A : Every step so downward, is a step upward. The man who renounces himself, comes to himself. (Emerson) 1339. Q: What does it mean to come to ourselves? A: There arises in us the dawn of a Knowledge of Truth. (Lotze) 1340. Q: A new realization has come to me. The invitations we receive from surrounding society have some kind of a hidden price tag on them. But esotericism's invitation asks only that we receive what is truly right for us. A : Come in! I will show thee that which will be profit- able to thee. (Bunyan) Be a student of esoteric facts 1341. Q: Members of our esoteric study group realize that truth alone is valuable, regardless of how it differs from our habitual ideas. Last night we discussed the pitiful thing which society calls friendship, which is really not much more than scared people huddling together against a threatening world. A : I have found that no exertion of the legs can bring two minds much nearer to one another. (Thoreau) 1342. Q: I am confident that the esoteric path is the only"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"MYSTIC GOOD NEWS FOR YOUR DAILY SUCCESS 27 1 way to rise above the human nightmare, but so many people think it is too far beyond them. A: It can nevertheless be found. (Spinoza) 1343. Q: Sensing this, I would like the boldness needed for success. A : Man, if you are anything at all, strive to walk alone and hold communion with yourself, instead of hiding in the chorus of men. Think, look around, arouse yourself, so that you will know who you are! (Epictetus) 1344. Q: I am becoming conscious of the harm in seeking approval from other human beings, but wish a scientific explanation of this false desire. A : If you let yourself be made out in the right by another, you must no less let yourself be made out in the wrong by him. If approval and reward come to you from another, you must also expect his disapproval and punish- ment. (Stirner) 1345. Q: How can we learn the difference between mere human opinion and universal truth? There must be a special sense by which we can separate truth from error. A: As the great ocean has only one taste, the taste of salt, so my doctrine has only one flavour, the flavour of emancipation. (Buddha) 1346. Q: You said that self-change also changes our attitude towards men of truth, that we newly value those who disturb us by giving us the blunt but life-saving truth about ourselves. Will you review this? A : Dear to us are those who love us . . . but dearer are those who reject us as unworthy, for they add another life: they build a heaven before us whereof we had not dreamed, and thereby supply to us new powers out of the recesses of the spirit, and urge us to new and unattempted pcrformai (Emerson)"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"272 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! 1347. Q: Will you say something about right attitudes to- wards an idea we may find difficult to understand? A : If you are a lover of instruction, you will be well instructed. (Isocrates) 1348. Q: What would be a favourable result of our studies? A : There is unspeakable pleasure attending the life of a voluntary student. (Goldsmith) 1349. Q: My question is about future conditions. What feel- ing should we have towards them? A: The mood of one who, seeing himself carried swiftly towards an event of mighty import, has nothing to do but wait — the mood in which philosophy vests an even- minded man with the utmost calm, and is ever so serviceable. (Wallace) 1350. Q: What encouraging thought can help us when we fall short of our inner aims? A : Begin wholly afresh. (Jefferies) A far richer life awaits you! 1351. Q: We are beginning to see the need for a constructive kind of self-influence, so will you please help us in this area? A : I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of a man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavour. It is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of art. (Thoreau) 1352. Q: We are told that goodness is its own reward, which I never used to believe, but now I am beginning to understand what it means. . J : What is virtue but repose of mind? (Thomson)"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"MYSTIC GOOD NEWS FOR YOUR DAILY SUCCESS 273 1353. Q: May we have a general rule for beneficial action? A : Nothing leads to good which is not natural. (Schil- ler) 1354. Q: I have recently solved an esoteric mystery. I now see that what is truly right for me is also truly right for everyone else. My false guilt about my duties towards others has fallen away. A : That is good news. (Bunyan) 1355. Q: These teachings reveal how we exhaust ourselves in useless tasks, like trying to impress others. Please tell us about a truly worthwhile task. A : The decrease of the general cause of suffering — illusion — is the only pleasant work which lies before a man, and gives him that true happiness in which his life consists. (Tolstoy) 1356. Q: Is it really true that a sudden flash of insight can instantly banish all misery and reveal perfect peace? It sounds too wonderful! A : Do you wish always to stray further? See, good lies as near; learn only to grasp happiness, for happiness is always here. (Goethe) 1357. Q: The mystics speak of the first dawning of under- standing which comes to the sincere seeker. Will you please discuss it? A: This sentiment is divine and deifying. It is the beatitude of man. It makes him illimitable. Through it, the soul first knows itself. It corrects the capital mistake of the infant man, who seeks to be great by following the great, and hopes to derive advantages from another - by showing the fountain of all good to be in himself, and that he, equally with every man, is an inlet into the deeps of Reason . . . then, deep melodies wander through his soul from Supreme- Wisdom. (Emerson)"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"274 THE MYSTIC MASTERS SPEAK! 1358. Q: You are saying that if a man will only take care of his garden he cannot fail to see the flowers. A : All is right with him. (Theologia Germanica) 1359. Q: How does a truth understood by the mind become a truth understood by the whole man? A: Like a dreamer who, in the midst of a well-known and ordinary landscape, comes without warning upon the mighty cone of a mountain. (MacDonald) 1360. Q: Please supply a supreme principle for constant guidance and encouragement. A : Higher, deeper, innermost, abides Another Life. (Bhagavad-Gita) Good news that remains good news a.

His inspiring books have sold more than 3,000,000 copies, and the figure mounts yearly. His simple but profound messages about human happiness have been translated into several foreign languages, including French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Japanese.
