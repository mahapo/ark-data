PahtminteJ Pantomime is a fascinating and basic form of dramatic art. Once a few rules are understood and applied, amusing panto- mimes can easily be staged for the enjoyment of both audience and actors. No words are spoken during a pantomime performance. All actions take place in total silence. To indicate that you are talking, you may freely move your lips as if speaking, though your lips should not form actual words. Use as many parts of your body as possible to express an action or a mood or an emotion. For indicating sleepiness you could stretch your arms, rub your eyes, cover a yawn, droop your shoulders, shuffle your feet, lie down, and so forth. When holding up an imaginary object, be sure to leave space between the fingers, just as if the object were actually in hand. For example, when holding a drinking glass, leave your fingers apart the actual distance of the glass. You can quickly grasp this by first holding a real glass and observing the spacing. The ability to create an illusion of space is aided by actually picking up and setting down the solid objects which you will use, such as a broom, potato, box, then doing the same thing with imaginary objects. Practice all pantomime movements with actual objects at first. For example, if you are to pantomime the act of removing"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"your coat, take off your own coat several times while observing the movements of your arms and body. Then proceed with the pantomimed version. A good pantomime actor is always conscious of imaginary scenery and stage properties, such as doors, lamps, tables. This will prevent you from \"walking through\" a closed door. Stage properties in pantomime acts are kept at a minimum. Objects such as a ball and a shovel should be imaginary. However, a few objects which are quite necessary to the act — perhaps a chair or table — may be used. Most pantomime acts can be performed on a bare stage. Backgrounds and scenery, if used at all, should be kept simple. A few flowers or shrubs are enough to indicate an outdoor setting. A sign or two will let the audience know that the scene takes place in a restaurant. Costumes may be as simple or as fancy as desired. Quite often a single item of dress will reveal the type of character you are playing, such as a feather for an Indian or a badge for a policeman. nnmAiuuiuii JL f<'6rAU»<4NT"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"SOME EASY GAMES FOR INTRODUCING PANTOMIME The following fun-filled games will serve several valuable purposes : 1. They will introduce the players to pantomime. 2. They will enable players to express themselves in a group where no one need feel shy or conspicuous. 3. They will give the players confidence in knowing what they can actually do. 4. They will broaden the players' self-expression through observation of the performance of others. 5. They will give players general experience which can be used in later performances."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"USE ALL THAT YOU HAVE! This amusing stunt will teach players to use all of their faculties for expressing a particular action or mood. Once they see that they need only to use freely those faculties which they already have^ there will be no stopping them ! Players stand in a circle. The leader or teacher then reads the following movements which express certain actions and attitudes. Players then act them out in pantomime. The leader can greatly assist by first showing them his own exaggerated version. 1. Say with your palm, \"Stop!\" (raise palm up and outward) 2. Say with your head, \"Yes.\" (nod head) 3. Say with your shoulder, \"I bumped the door.\" (bump shoulder vigorously against imaginary door) 4. Say with your eyes, \"I don't understand.\" (raise eye- brows and blink eyes in bewilderment)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"5. Say with your foot, \"I'm waiting.\" (keep heel down, tap toes against floor impatiently) 6. Say with your ear, \"I hear a songbird.\" (tilt ear upward and look up sideways) 7. Say with your waist, \"I'm dancing.\" (sway hips) 8. Say with your jaw, \"I'm surprised.\" (suddenly drop jaw) 9. Say with your tongue (no words), \"I like this cake.\" (roll tongue around lips) 10. Say with your finger, \"Come here.\" (beckon coyly with finger) 1 1. Say with your arms, \"I'm running.\" (wildly churn arms as if running) 12. Say with your fingertips, \"This potato is hot!\" (touch imaginary potato, jerk away from it) 13. Say with your nose, \"I smell fresh pie.\" (sniff in appre- ciation) 14. Say with your chest, \"I'm relaxed.\" (take a deep, relaxing breath) 15. Say with your legs, \"I'm slipping!\" (slip, but catch yourself before falling) 10"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"YOU ARE! Players should now have some idea how easy it is to express themselves without using their voice. Further encourage their understanding by having them pantomime these situations wordlessly. 1 . You are happy while playing catch. 2. You are hungry for lunch. 3. You are surprised at receiving a birthday present. 4. You are sad after dropping a glass. 5. You arc tired after playing hard. 6. You are puzzled over a strange sound. 7. You are cheerful as you sweep the floor. 8. You are peaceful as you see the blue sky. 9. You are not interested in a television program. 10. You are wondering at your dog's disappearance. 11. You are sleepy as you go to bed. 12. You are cold as you stand in the snow. 13. You are hot as you stand in the sun. 14. You are gay as you hear peppy music. 15. You are excited over a ball game. 11"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"^ /^V HANDY PANTOMIMES Players may now be assigned their first simple, individual pantomimes (really charades). Each player performs one of the listed actions while the others try to guess what is being done. Although hands and arms are the principal means of expression other faculties should also be used. The purpose of this first performance is clarity of action. The leader should explain that even though the players know what they are doing, they must also make the action clear to the viewers. It contributes to clarity to have players briefly bow their heads just before and just after their performances; otherwise the viewers will think that the exits and entrances are part of the act. 1. Paste stamp on letter. 2. Open and close door. 3. Pick up and dial telephone. 4. Feed crumbs to birds. 5. Sail a gUder. 6. Cut paper with scissors. 7. Clean a window. 8. Trim a hedge with large shears. 12"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"9. Open drawer, remove object, close drawer. 10. Play marbles. 1 1 . Balance a stick on palm. 12.

He does this in either of two ways: by actions and attitudes which are in keeping with his destination, or by wearing or carrying an object which is associated with his destination. For instance, a player going to bed could sleepily rub his eyes or carry a clock. The narrator may introduce a series of stunts by saying: \"We are about to see a number of folks who are going places. Let's try to find out where they are going.\" Players may then cross the stage one after another with only a brief pause between each. As soon as a player exits the narrator might say something like: \"That was Sleepyhead Sam — looks like he's going to bed.'''' Players can work out their own destinations or use the listed ones. 1. to bed (sleepily carry clock) 2. to work (briskly carry briefcase) 3. to the beach (gaily bounce beach ball) 4. to a wedding (mischievously open box of rice) 5. to a picnic (bouncily carry picnic basket) 6. to a fire (quickly drag hose) 7. to school (happily carry books) 8. to church (solemnly carry prayer book) 9. to a party (humorously wear comic hat) 10. to dinner (hungrily carry fork) 14"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PANTOMIME MARCH This march takes place without any of the marchers' moving far from the spot. As the directions are given by the leader, the marchers move their legs up and down, turning as directed, but never going more than a few feet from the assigned spot. Short and simple routines will be best for younger players, while older ones may work out longer and more complex movements. With a bit of practice this can be an unusually effective stunt — with or without accompanying music. Here are a few ideas for marching which will get the group off to a fine start. 1. March in step 13. Other alternate marchers 2. High step turn left, face partner, 3. Left foot only salute 4. Right foot only 14. Swing arms 5. Left turn 15. March in little circles 6. Right turn 16. March in one-step squares 7. About face 17. Dip knees every third step 8. March on every other beat 18. Alternate marchers circle 9. Stand at attention partners 10. Clap in rhythm 19. Single Une facing audience 11. Salute audience 20. Exit holding salute to 12. Alternate marchers turn audience right, salute 15"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PANTOMIME ANSWERS A player secretly thinks of an object of any kind. He then stands before the guessers and answers their questions about the object — not out loud, but with pantomime movements. The questions need not necessarily be of the kind that can be answered with a yes or no ; the audience can ask any question which the actor can answer with a pantomime movement. Here is how the questions and answers might go if the actor's secret object were a merry-go-round. \"Is it large or small?\" (player holds his hands out wide) \"Is it found in the house?\" (player shakes head) \"Does it have moving parts?\" (player nods) \"How does it move?\" (player spins forefinger in flat circle) \"Does it carry things?\" (player nods) \"What does it carry?\" (player indicates audience and himself) \"Is it a bus?\" (player shakes head) \"Where is it usually located?\" (player gestures in several directions) \"Is it used for amusement?\" (player nods) \"Is it a merry-go-round?\" (player nods) If desired, the audience may be required to guess the object within twenty questions. 16"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"YES AND NO PANTOMIMES The game leader asks a series of questions on a level with the knowledge of the players. (See samples below.) The questions should be of the kind that can be answered either yes or no. Before each question the leader gives instructions, such as, \"If the answer is yes, raise your left arm; if the answer is no, do nothing,\" or, \"If the answer is yes, pat your head; if the answer is no, do nothing.\" A different movement should be requested with each question. Players must answer questions quickly without stopping to puzzle out the answer. If a player acts when he should do nothing, or if he does nothing when he should act, he drops out of the play. The final player wins the stunt. Sample questions: 1. Is the dime smaller than a nickel? (yes) 2. Does the sun rise in the west? (no) 3. Is d the third letter of the alphabet? (no) 4. Is Nevada one of our fifty states ? (yes) 5. Is re a higher note than do ? (yes) 17"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ADD AND ACT Here is pantomime fun for the entire group. The play leader starts things off by making a movement of any kind, such as shaking his left knee. The group must imitate the movement. The leader then makes a second motion, perhaps that of nodding his head. The group then performs both movements in order. The leader continues new actions without repeating those that went before, and the players must add the new action to the series. The fun lasts for as long as players can remember the actions in the right order, beginning with the first one. 18"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MOVING AROUND Each performer is allowed about one minute in which to move around in a circle in as many different ways as possible. For instance, a player might skip, stumble, run. The player with the cleverest performance might be awarded a prize. The instructor can assist his group to get the idea by reading aloud the following types of movement : skip, stumble, run, fall, trip, walk slow motion, sUde, dance, tiptoe, stamp, hop, leap, jump backward, side-step, waddle, walk ape-like, walk stiff-legged, walk heel-to-toe, crawl on hands and knees. CHALLENGES Here is a stunt which helps actors to think quickly. Four or five volunteers sit on the stage. Members of the audience think up a pantomime act and challenge a volunteer to perform it. The challenges should not be too difficult. A volunteer might be asked to imitate an animal or to show how a pohceman directs traffic. The audience may call for a single performer or for several actors to perform at once. 19"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"LAUGH ACT The actor who performs this pantomime has but one thing to do — to laugh silently in as many ways as he can. The performer comes on stage, faces the audience, and takes a piece of paper from his pocket on which a joke is supposed to be written. He pretends to read the joke — and starts laughing at it! A clever actor can make the audience howl with delight by going through hilarious actions. Build up the laugh from a chuckle to a belly laugh and finish by collapsing from merri- ment, roUing on the floor, kicking your legs, drying your eyes or wringing out your handkerchief. The champion performer is one whose audience laughs more than he does ! 20"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"DESCRIPTIONS In this pantomime game, a player is to describe a famous person from history or fiction by one distinguishing character- istic. The viewers first try to guess the symbol of the pantomime (such as tallness) and then try to name the famous person who matches the description (such as tall Abraham Lincoln). Viewers may supply the name of any famous person who matches the description, not necessarily the example supplied below. The group may use these examples for thinking up their own descriptions. 1. A tall man. (Abraham Lincoln) 2. A soldier. (George Washington) 3. A sleepy man. (Rip Van Winkle) 4. An orator. (Patrick Henry) 5. A small man. (Napoleon) 6. A writer. (William Shakespeare) 7. A detective. (Sherlock Holmes) 8. A singer. (Jenny Lind) 9. A king. (King Arthur) 10. A strong man. (Samson) 21"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"MUSICAL MOODS Select a phonograph record (preferably a symphony) which includes several changes of mood and pace. Work out panto- mime movements that are in accord with the various moods. For example: 1. Opening mood: sit or lie about while reading, studying, quietly chatting. 2. Awakening mood: stand, stretch, look about for something active to do. 3. Lively mood: race about, play tag, laugh, shout. 4. Restful mood: grow tired, rub eyes, stretch, again he down. 5. Majestic mood: march about in step, exit. For other types of music, other actions are appropriate. Try to suit your movements to the rhythm and mood, to show that you understand the music. 22"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"ALL KINDS OF SONGS A player pantomimes the act of singing a certain type of song. He does everything he can to express silently the nature and the mood of his song. The stage properties may be real or imaginary, though in most cases they should be imaginary. The type of song may be announced beforehand to the viewers, or they may try to guess it. 1. Patriotic song (wave flag, express appreciation of countryside). 2. Love song (sing tenderly, kneel as if serenading sweet- heart, smile affectionately). 3. Indian song (whoop by clapping palm against mouth, dance in Indian fashion). 4. Sad song (sing slowly, weep, sadly gesture). 5. Cowboy song (sit astride chair as if riding horse, juggle reins about, twirl a rope). 6. Operatic song (sing grandly with deep dramatic ex- pression in imitation of an opera singer). 7. Comic song (leap about, grin, gaily gesture). 8. Sea song (steer ship, imitate a sailor). 9. Lullaby (rock baby in arms, gently sway, sing softly). 10. Christmas song (imitate Santa Claus, pretend to decor- ate Christmas tree). 11. MiUtary song (march, salute, stand at attention). 12. Sacred song (hold hymn book with both hands, sing reverently, bow head). 13. Hawaiian song (imitate Hawaiian dancer). 14. Winter song (skate on ice, throw snowballs). 15. Spanish song (imitate Spanish dancer, play guitar). 23"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"STRANGE SPEECHES This is always good for lots of fun. A player merely pantomimes the act of giving a rousing speech. The more bounce and en- thusiasm he puts into his act the better! He should make all sorts of wild gestures and exaggerated facial expressions. A performer should be given a brief spoken introduction, such as, \"And here is Jerry Wilson who will speak on the topic, How to Fly a Kite in a Closets The pantomimed actions need have little or nothing to do with the announced topic. A prize might be awarded to the best — that is, to the most enthusiastic — performer. Players may think up their own topics or may select a listed one. 1. How to Fly a Kite in a Closet 2. My Cold Trip to the North Pole 3. What I Think About Spaghetti 4. How to Stand on Your Head 5. Famous Cowboys of the West 6. Washing Dishes Can Be Fun 7. How to Blow Soap Bubbles 8.

In turn they act out the characteristic movements of these animals while the other players try to identify them. Players should be re- minded that they may act out the sounds — such as the barking of a dog or the roaring of a lion — but they must do so in silence. The listed animals (with suggested actions) are especially suitable for this stunt. 1. tiger (pace, growl) 2. beaver (swim, chew imaginary tree) 3. monkey (leap, scratch) 4. horse (gallop, buck) 5. bear (waddle, hug) 6. rabbit (hop, munch) 7. goat (charge, ram) 8. lion (roar, claw) 9. dog (bark, sit up) 10. kangaroo (hold limp paws, hop) 11. squirrel (dart, crack nuts) 12. seal (swim, flap fins) 13. wolf (howl, slink) 14. crocodile (swim, snap teeth) 15. gorilla (strut, beat chest) 16. bull (snort, paw ground) 17. cat (lap milk, curl up) 18. deer (tilt head, race lightly off) 25"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"BUY IT! A player pantomimes the act of buying something. With a little thought, you can create a funny act, for example, by testing the product, dropping it, losing it, and so on. The player who buys perfume could sniff in joy, apply it to her elbows, drink it, pour it on her head, and so on. Players should be allowed at least a few minutes to work out their acts. They should be announced something like, \"Let's watch Miss Lucy Parker as she buys a bottle of perfume.\" Here are some items that will be interesting to purchase : 1. typewriter 16. portable sewing machine 2. tall lamp 17. set of dishes 3. gasoHne-powered lawn- 18. diamond necklace mower 19. tank-type vacuum cleaner 4. bicycle 20. evening gown 5. trombone 21. house paint 6. television set 22. bouquet (corsage) 7. derby hat 23. bathroom scale 8. alarm clock 24. riding boots 9. dictionary 25. perfume 10. oil painting 26. roller skates 1 1 . small automobile 27. basketball 12. long gloves 28. fishing pole 13. umbrella or parasol 29. earrings 14. toothbrush 30. garden hose 15. automobile tire 26"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"ACT-OUT STORIES Two players perform this stunt together. One of them takes the part of the narrator, while the other is the actor. As they stand side by side onstage, the narrator tells (or reads) any kind of story, perhaps a children's classic such as \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" or a familiar poem which has lots of action. The narrator pauses every so often during the story to permit the player to act out an incident in pantomime. The story then resumes until the next good place for the player to demonstrate the narrator's lines. The actor can make any kind of movement which illustrates the story, such as leaping about, putting on a pained expression, and performing specific acts such as climbing or sleeping. An offstage phono- graph record playing suitable music will add much to the dramatic effect. Another way of playing is to have the narrator tell a funny or embarrassing experience which is acted out by his partner. An entire show can be presented with this idea. Allow several couples time to prepare act-out stories, which can be offered at intervals during the party. 27"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"OCCUPATIONS It would be a good idea to read aloud the listed occupations and permit each player to select the one he prefers. The more an occupation appeals to a player the more Hkely he is to succeed with it.

A performer pantomimes the act of making a vocal sound. He does not actually utter the sound, of course, but makes facial expressions and body movements which indicate it. The other players try to identify the sound he is making. After each player has performed, the teacher may make suggestions for improvement. The performer should be re- minded that inasmuch as view^ers cannot hear the sound, it must be revealed to them by means of sight. This can be accom- plished through exaggerating the movements that we normally make with the sound. 1. sigh 16. whisper 2. sneeze 17. gurgle 3. whistle 18. snore 4. choke 19. hum 5. shriek 20. snarl 6. growl 21. sniff 7. shout 22. chuckle 8. laugh 23. cry 9. breathe 24. groan 10. sing 25. pant 11. cough 26. gasp 12. smack 27. giggle 13. gulp 28. snort 14. swallow 29. bark 15. blow 30. sputter 31"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ALL SORTS OF SOUNDS Here is another fine stunt with sounds.

CkafadeS Charades is a fun-filled game in which a word or a series of words is acted out in pantomime for the audience to guess. The charade maker reveals his secret word in any way he can — by motioning or gesturing or posing. All his actions are done in silence; no words are spoken, nor does he form words with his hps. For example: a player could reveal the first part of the word watermelon by pretending to pour and drink a glass of water. The viewers might guess wrong at first by asking if he means glass or drink. When the actor shakes his head they keep guessing until they discover that he means water. The actor could then reveal the second part of the word (or the word as a whole) by pretending to slice and eat a piece of melon. If a single word (rather than a whole sentence) is to be guessed, you would first hold up the number of fingers equal to the number of syllables in your secret word. The word rainbow^ for instance, contains two syllables, so you would hold up two fingers to let the audience know this. You next hold up one finger to indicate that you will now act out the first syllable. When they have guessed rain^ you hold up two fingers to show that you will next act out the second syllable. If the charade consists of a whole sentence you would hold up as many fingers as there are words in your sentence. If the audience fails to guess the first word you can hold up two 38"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"fingers to show them that you will go on to the second word. You can later come back to the first word if necessary. To indicate small words in a sentence, hold your thumb and forefinger about one inch apart. This will help the audience to guess such small words as the, it, and, or. You need only reveal the sound of your secret word or syllable, not necessarily its correct spelling. So if you wish to reveal the word right, you could pretend to write. Let the audience know that you are giving them a word which rhymes with your secret word by first cupping your hand to your ear. This lets them know that the secret word sounds like the word that you want them to guess. You can then indicate an object which rhymes with your secret word. For the sound of sea, for example, you would give the audience a hint that it rhymes with knee by pointing to your knee. A game of charades usually consists of words with two syllables or more; however, words with just one syllable add variety to the play. Beginners may wish to act out one-syllable words such as tree, look, spin. The game may be played with teams or simply with individual performers. For team play, one side acts out several charades (one at a time) for the other side to guess. An umpire with a watch with a second-hand keeps time. The team completing its charades in the fewer number of minutes wins the game. For individual play, any volunteer may give several charades for the group to guess. A time limit of three minutes may be set in advance for the discovery of a difficult secret word or sentence. Or, you may prefer to play as long as it takes for the sentence to be guessed. 39"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"ABC CHARADES Each player is assigned a different letter of the alphabet. He is allowed one minute in which to act out as many objects as possible which begin with his letter. The performer having the letter A might act out apple, arm, automobile, ape, airplane. When the viewers guess an object the performer scores a point. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. If desired, a shorter or longer performance period may be set. THREE-LETTER CHARADES This is played somewhat as the above game, except that players try to act out as many objects as possible which are spelled with three letters. A player might try cat, ice, cup, rug, hoe. After a number of three-letter words, you might try four- letter or five-letter words. 40"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"FACTS ABOUT FOLKS Before playing this game the leader collects one interesting secret fact about everyone in the room.

WHAT'S IN THE NEWS? A few players pretend to read a newspaper heading, then together act out for the rest of the players or audience the event which they have \"read.\" The audience need only guess the general nature of the headline.

Half the players leave the room. They then return, one at a time, as fully disguised as possible. (A typical disguise might be an oversized coat, plus a paper sack — cut with eye-holes — over the head.) The actor performs any kind of a pantomime which will reveal his real identity. For instance, a boy who is known to have a paper route might pretend to deliver papers; a girl who plays a musical instrument might imitate a musician. The clues should not be too easy. When all the members of one group have been identified, they become the guessers of the other group. DOG NAMES Here is a charade with a humorous twist. A player acts out the name of his dog. However, his dog does not have a com- monplace name such as Fido or Rover, but the strangest name possible. He might be called Bonechew or Barkerboy or Catchase.

The players in the audience may shout as many guesses as they can as rapidly as they can. When a guesser shouts the word saw, the pantomimist nods to indicate that he has found the right word.

The pantomimists (either individuals taking turns or teams alternating), keeping the list secret, act out the listed words for an audience (or for the other team) to guess. When someone in the audience (or a member of the guessing team) thinks he knows the word being acted out, he must call out two words, synonyms (words meaning more or less the same thing) which should correspond to those on this list. However, it's best not to be too exact in the requirements, as there are many words meaning the same thing. For example, the Ust calls for quick and fast, but rapid and speedy would be just as acceptable. If the guess is wrong, the pantomimist continues until he hears two correct words. Then the game continues with the next synonyms. 1 . quick and fast 2. laugh and chuckle 3. strong and mighty 4. look and see 5. mystery and puzzle 6. drop and spill 7. fasten and tie 8.

For this charade the exact letters in the first word are used to build the second word. For instance, from the word swing the anagram of wings could be built. To begin, a player acts out the first word, and when this is guessed by one of the viewers, he (or his team) must rearrange its letters to find the secret word which contains the same letters. The first viewer (or team) to do this is awarded a point for himself (or for his team) . If a blackboard is handy the game director can write out the first word (once it is guessed) so as to make it easier for viewers to rearrange its letters. The first word in each of the following sets is the one to be acted out. The second word suggests an anagram answer, although in some cases there are several answers possible. 1. lamp (palm) 2. pear (reap) 3. stop (post) 4. read (dare) 5. stew (west) 6. eat (tea) 7. north (thorn) 8. petal (plate) 9. rope (pore) 10. sword (words) 11. taste (state) 12. throw (worth) 13. stab (bats) 14. race (care) 15. blow (bowl) 16. leap (peal) 17. grin (ring) 18. plum (lump) 19. tide (diet) 20. drop (prod) 21. shoe (hose) 22. golf (flog) 23. steam (meats) 24. wolf (flow) 25. smile (miles) 26. snap (naps) 27. stub (tubs) 28. owl (low) 29. heart (earth) 30. march (charm) 72"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"SECTION 3. Pahtmi'me ^kiU In this section you will find not only skits but also suggestions for creating your own skits. The rules of pantomime apply to all the skits here, and no lines need be memorized, but some rehearsal will be necessary for top performance. The narrator (when a narrator is called for) can read his lines. The following chart of stage positions will help you more clearly to direct the performance of others or to find your own stage positions. Use this guide whenever you need to establish or change a position on stage. All positions are given from the viewpoint of the actor as he faces the audience. It will help you to remember the difference between up stage and down stage by mentally picturing the stage as slanting downward toward the audience. Down stage is next to the audience. (Audience here) Left wing Down stage left Down stage center Down stage right Center stage left Center stage Center stage right Up stage left Up stage center Up stage right Right wing (Back of stage here) 73"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Add a few sound effects wherever possible. Have an off- stage sound man accompany the act with sounds such as bells, crashes, slammed doors, etc. The offstage sound should occur at exactly the same moment as the onstage action. A bit of practice will help your sound man to create effects that are just right. In some cases it is a good idea to give your skit a musical background. The music should harmonize with the mood of the onstage action; for instance, merry music should accompany a merry scene. The music should not play so loudly that it takes away the attention of the audience from the performers. A record player or a pianist will serve nicely. If you have no real stage or if your stage does not have a curtain, the players may show that their act has ended merely by bowing and exiting. Exaggerate all movements, gestures, and facial expressions. Remember, your audience is at a distance. If you smile, make it a wide smile, if you are gay, show that you are very gay. Make every mood clearly mean what it is supposed to mean. When one group of players is leading the action, the other players should more or less remain inactive. The audience can usually follow only one action at a time, so do not divide their attention. Do not look directly at the viewers. When glancing in their direction, keep your eyes on a level slightly above their heads. Watch your timing. Do not proceed with a second move- ment before the first movement is complete. Let each action tell its full story. Do not come onstage too early or too late. Do not permit an actor to interrupt the scene of another actor. Correct timing can be worked out during rehearsals. When working out your skit, try to put yourself in the place of the audience. Ask yourself such questions as, \"If I were out there, could I clearly see everything? . . . Would I know exactly what is supposed to be happening? . . . Could I 74"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"t^b? improve things by moving a bit faster or perhaps a bit slow^er?\" By answering your own questions you will surely build a popu- lar skit.

Each couple works out a pantomime skit centered about a telephone conversation. This skit may run from one to five minutes. Players should try to build a simple story with a beginning, a middle, and an amusing conclusion. For instance, the plot might be that player A tries to get player B to speak louder on the phone. Player A indicates this by straining his ear at the receiver and by motioning upward. Player B then speaks louder and louder until — at the finish — he bellows so loud that he knocks his partner off his chair. Partners may sit at tables or simply stand on opposite sides of the stage. The skit begins when one of the partners dials the phone and the other cups a hand to his ear and lifts the receiver. Here are a few typical ideas: 1 . Player A talks so long and so monotonously that player B drops his head and dozes. 2. Both talk excitedly and with sweeping gestures at the same time. 3. Player A wants to show player B something in a book, so player A holds an open book before the mouthpiece and points to the pages without speaking. Player B then nods as if seeing the pages. 4. Both open lunches and munch while conversing. They fumble awkwardly as they try to hold the phone while un- wrapping a sandwich or opening a bottle. Player A speaks into a sandwich as if it were the mouthpiece ; player B holds an apple to his ear as if it were the receiver. 5. Player A holds up a sheet of music and gaily sings, player B smacks his ear in pain and holds the receiver as far away from his ear as possible, then draws receiver close once 87"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"more, sways and smiles as he decides the singing is melodious after all. 6. Player A talks on and on without a single break, so player B yawns and rips pages off a calendar every few seconds. 7. Player A assumes a mischievous grin, tells player B to hold the hne a moment, picks up a cat which he permits to meow into the phone. Player B reacts with bewilderment at the change in player A's \"voice.\" (The cat can be real or imaginary. An imaginary cat can be indicated by gently picking it up from the floor with both hands and stroking it.) 8. Players chat for a while, rush off hurriedly and briefly to work — such as sweeping the floor — then rush back to phones. This can be repeated two or three times. MIRROR STUNT With a bit of practice this idea can be developed into a highly entertaining act. The idea is for two players to har- monize their pantomime movements so as to give the appear- ance of one player looking at his reflection in a full-length mirror. This means that both players comb their hair or brush their teeth in unison, just as if one player performed these movements in front of a mirror. Here are notes and suggestions for building a superior performance. 1. Players face each other, sideways to the audience. 2. The two players should be approximately the same height and dress alike. 3. Practice a single movement until it is harmonious, then go on to the next one. 88"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"4. Practice all movements in slow motion at first, then speed up slightly. It is best if all movements are done with only moderate speed. 5. Choose broad, sweeping movements that can be clearly seen by the audience. 6. Keep feet planted in one place except when making definite foot movements. 7. Do not smile or laugh. (This makes it even funnier!) 8. Some typically amusing movements are: (a) Lean for- ward and touch noses as if peering closely into mirror, (b) Gaze in fond admiration by passing hand over hair and tilting head in a dramatic pose, (c) Players push palms together and rotate arms as if polishing the mirror, (d) Twist face into comi- cal expressions, (e) Smile broadly. 9. The act may be given a funny finish by doing the fol- lowing: Player A waves good-by but player B beckons \"Come here.\" Player A then beckons \"Come here\" as player B waves good-by. They briefly stare in surprise at each other, shrug, face audience, bow in unison, exit. 89"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"BIRTHDAY SURPRISES The aim of this pantomime skit is for a player to show all sorts of reactions and emotions at receiving a birthday present. He starts off by eagerly opening the package. The package is a real one which has been previously filled with the present by the performer. For convenience, the package should consist of a box which is already open at the top, although the per- former pretends to unwrap and open it. After opening the package he lifts the present from the box and goes into an act which includes a broad variety of exag- gerated reactions such as joy, shock, bewilderment, amazement, gratitude, etc. To build a comedy show, additional actors and actresses can come onstage one after another, look at the present and go through a series of emotions, too. Here are twenty \"presents\" with suggestions for panto- mime. 1. A shoe (wonder at the single shoe, take off own shoes, put on shoe, limp offstage) 2. A dog collar and leash (hold them out, pretend to call a dog from several directions, shrug as no dog appears, place collar around own neck and lead self off by leash) 3. A comic drawing (peer at it from several angles, laugh lightly, increase laughter until you are hysterically roaring, show picture to audience. Note: the picture can be of any comical nature, perhaps a scrawled drawing of the actor with his name beneath it) 4. A tattered, oversized jacket (hold it up in admiration, put it on, brush it off, proudly strut around) 5. A small rug (scratch head and wonder what to do with it, lay it on floor, walk down its length, turn around and pick it up, again lay it in front of you, again walk its length, continue to do this until you have walked offstage) 90"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"6. A pillow (lie down, set pillow under head, adjust its position several times, stretch, peacefully sleep) 7. A whiskbroom (go through fancy and funny motions while brushing yourself off — such as brushing your sleeve with dramatic sweeps and brushing off the soles of your shoes, also your elbows and ears) 8. A rope (test it by tugging on it, tie yourself up, happily skip around the stage for a moment or two, skip offstage) 9. A book (read while expressing a wide variety of emotions at the story, grow more excited as you turn pages, close book and sigh with emotional exhaustion) 10. A pencil or some other commonplace and inexpensive object (throw up arms in rapture as you peer into box, lift pencil, hold it up in deep admiration, hug it to chest while swaying in breathless joy) 1 1 . A cube of wrapped butter (unwrap end of cube, take a slice of bread from pocket, rub butter over it, hungrily take a bite or two) 12. Ajar labeled GLUE (dip fingers into imaginary glue, frown at your sticky fingers, rub them off on hip, find that your fingers are stuck to hip, try to pull them off with other hand) 13. An unshelled peanut (eagerly open a large box, throw inner wrappings aside, reach excitedly inside, pull out and hold up the peanut, look shocked, shrug, shell and eat peanut) 14. A balloon (playfully toss balloon into air, kick and swat it around, chase it offstage) 15. A small can labeled OIL (grin, pretend to oil your joints, such as elbows, knees, ankles, freely move joints to indicate that they now bend much easier) 16. A glass of water (gaze doubtfully at it as if wondering what to do with it, take a sip, wash your hands, pull a flower from your pocket and place it in glass, exit while sniffing flower) 91"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"17. A monster mask (put it on, stalk about stage while imitating a monster by clawing, creeping, grabbing, pretend to chase someone offstage) 18. A tube of toothpaste (nod in appreciation, take tooth- brush from pocket, pretend to squeeze toothpaste onto tooth- brush, vigorously pretend to brush teeth as you exit) 19. A dish of candy (eat a piece, react with pleasure at its dehcious taste, eat another, suddenly become aware of viewers, pass dish down to them) 20. A large feather (playfully tickle your toes, chuckle, tickle your ear and laugh, quickly tickle yourself all over while silently roaring with merriment, exit while tickling and laughing) i 92"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"WAITER!

I'm sorry folks, but I just can't keep up with them any longer. Good-by. (Narrator waves to Hikers.) And a happy hike to you, Happy Hikers. (Narrator weakly exits at right.

A few bushes, buckets and similar items will help to indicate the period. A river, which splits the stage from upstage to downstage, is indi- cated by lengths of rippled rope set a few feet apart. Narrator : Many years ago some pioneer children journeyed to the West with their parents. One morning they ran from their covered wagons to play in the wide, lazy river. (Western Children rush in from the right, play between the right wing and their side of the river bank. They recognize the river by wading near the shore, drinking, splashing water on each other.)

Narrator : One little Western boy waded to the middle of the river to take a look. (Western boy wades to center of river, peers by raising palm to brow, throws up arms in fright, rushes back in alarm, tells others of Indians. The Western Children excitedly peer and chatter with each other while gesturing across the river.) Narrator : And a little Indian boy decided to see who was making all the noise on the other side of his river. (Indian boy dupUcates action of Western boy.

And the Indian Children were so frightened of the Western Children that they also scooted away! (Indian Child- ren run offstage.) Narrator : Now this was a very sad thing. None of the children could enjoy the wide, lazy river any more. It's too bad they were so scared of each other ! (sadly close book, shake head.) So I guess that is the end of the story . . .

This is a familiar situation which the players can develop into an entertaining pantomime running for 15 to 20 minutes. It is excellent for large groups, inasmuch as an endless number of passengers can enter and exit. The play director first gets the actors and actresses together to work out a series of incidents and happenings aboard the bus. The incidents are then acted out one after another to form the total pantomime play. Listed below are fifteen basic situations which can be easily developed into funny and surprising scenes. Players can think of others. The stage is set with rows of chairs representing bus seats, with a different type of chair at the front representing the driver's seat. Have two rows of chairs with an aisle between them. The play director should make sure that the chairs are so arranged that the audience can see the actions clearly. A good arrangement is to slant the chairs from upstage left to down- stage right. 1 . A lady passenger fumbles so awkwardly in her handbag for her fare that she spills packages all over the defense- less driver. 124"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"2. Three passengers scramble for a single scat. They end up trying to share it. 3. At one stop, all of the passengers get off at the rear door and immediately re-enter from the front. They do this casually, as if it were the normal thing to do. 4. The weary driver tries to explain directions to a lady passenger who just does not seem to understand. 5. Passengers bounce up and down as the bus hits a bumpy road. Some of them bounce across the aisle to exchange seats. 6. A beggar enters, pantomimes the fact that he has no money. He entertains the passengers with a brief dance, passes his hat for a collection, pays his fare and sits down. 7. A passenger insists on telling the driver how to drive. The driver finally gives up by placing the shocked passenger in the driver's seat while he, the driver, relaxes among the passengers. 8. A passenger enters with arms outstretched as if walking in his sleep. He pays his fare, walks to a seat and sleeps. After several other scenes have been performed by other players he rises and exits, still walking in his sleep. 9. The driver pulls to a halt, opens his lunch box, casually eats. An impatient passenger angrily protests while point- ing to his watch. The driver offers him a slice of cake which is so delicious the passenger forgets all about the time. 10. An actor in the costume and mask of a monkey boards the bus to cause all sorts of confusion. He tries to sit in the lap of a frightened lady or chases someone out of the rear door of the bus. 11. A pair of players dressed as swordsmen enter while dueling (with imaginary swords) . They halt long enough to pay their fares casually, then resume dueling down the aisle and out of the rear door. 125"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"12. A small child insists on offering his lollipop to the driver. When the driver frantically refuses, the child continues to insist by rubbing the imaginary lollipop into the driver's face and hair. 13. The bus driver makes wide turns and sudden halts. The passengers sway or fall forward or perform other movements according to the driver's actions. 14. The first man in Une at a bus stop is crowded onto the bus by those behind him. He is further crowded down the aisle and out of the rear door. 15. A lady standing in the aisle uses every trick possible to get the attention of a seated man (in hopes he will prove gallant), but he carefully avoids taking the hint.

Children can invent dramatic situations through the use of move- ment, facial expressions and gestures — all without talking, which is the essence of pantomime. Mr. Howard starts with simple pantomimes for individual and group acting, then builds up to more involved pantomimes — with and without scenery and props. Then, he shows how to play charades, and how young players can make each charade a skit! In the process, he gives meticulous directions and hints for beginners, as well as advice for everyone, including host, teacher, leader and director. This new, revised and updated, illustrated treasury includes over 1,000 clever pantomimes and charades. Even shy youngsters will want to come out from the \"wings\" and join in the fun. \"A wealth of ideas complete with acting-out directions.\" — A.L.A.
