Or perhaps not! Standing as we are on the threshold of a new era, the first dawning of a new age, there is an air of expectancy of things imminent and better. In a certain sense this has psychologically programmed us with a willingness to em brace new concepts, to inaugurate and accept far-reaching change. It is also a time to reflect upon the very foun- dations of what we call 'civilisation' and to reassess their validity and where they have led, taking the good thi ngs with us and leaving the bad ones behind. So it seems timely that the radi cal departure in energy concepts pre- sented here, should be made available now, when the tide of human develop- ment is turning and the impetus of this renewing flood can be harnessed to launch Viktor Schauberger's pioneering discoveries into a world more ready than ever before to implement them. At a time also, when the activities of humanity are increasingly seen to be on a head-on collision course with Nature's processes. An alarming increase in the scope and ferocity of so-called 'natural disasters' is forcing us to r ealise that the future is no longer secure; that other solutions to those presently proposed must quickly be found to remedy the present state of affairs. In my view, these will be largely ineffective unless Viktor Schauberger's important contributions towards the production of virtually free energy and high qua lity drinking water - the foundation of healthy life - are not taken into account a priori. What we are concerned with here is an inversion of all that has hitherto been held to be true scientifically and technologically. As obvious as it is true that one cannot wash one's clothes in the same water that soiled them, so too can no new ecotechnology be founded on existing 'laws' and dogma, which have so disastrously failed. While such new departures in thought are usually referred to as 'revolutions', what is invol ved here is an 'evolution'. This is no form of repetition, a re-cycling of outworn concepts and processes, but an upward movement to totally new and hi gher levels not only of perception, but also of application of systems of an entirely new dimension and order. It is a movement away from the ceasel ess round, the endless unproductive turn- ing or 'revolution' of the wheel, th e chief symbol of our technology and a derivative of the geometrical element of the circle. While progress of a sort is made as the wheel turns, the wheel it self does not evolve and always returns viii C"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Introduction ix upon itself. Having no in-built capacity for change and transformation it effectively contributes nothing to real evolutive progress. Implicit in this evolution towards higher perception and a new modus operandi is the necessity to think an oc tave higher, as Viktor Schauberger so often expresses it. Just how fundamentally we will have to ch ange our way of thinking and acting to achieve this we have yet to discover, although the infor- mation contained in this book will provide many of the necessary keys. Once inserted into the lock of evolution, new as yet unimagined vistas will unfold themselves and can become manifest, pr ovided the will and determination are present to enter upon them. But what it is that must change to pe rmit this to happen? Basically it is a question of the geometrical system so familiar to us. This is the geometry of Euclid and essentially involves the elements of the straight line, circle and point, all of which are perfect forms a nd therefore unchanging. Such perfection requires no further input from external factors, nor can it productively interact with them and therefore these elements ar e sterile 'closed' systems. In terms of their physical appearance, these are the cylinders, spheres, wheels, straight shafts, pipes, flat surfaces, etc. in common use today. As transcendental con- structs, i.e. belonging not to the physical world but to the realms of mental ideation, these geometrical elements are physically 'unreal' and in their appli- cation to the physical world are therefor e 'unnatural'. Consequently their use in the construction and operation of to day's machines and the energies they produce are in discordance with Nature's laws. Steeped in the grandeur of Euclidean edifices over the last two millennia and the apparent appropriateness and su itability of Euclidean geometry for all purposes, we must now reappraise our unqualified acceptance of it, for it lies at the very root of our troubles. On earlier European structures the straight lines and hard edges were softened and made pleasing to the eye through their often exuberant embellis hment. The Chinese on the other hand, versed in the art of geomancy, constr ucted their traditional buildings differ- ently, deliberately curving the profile of the roof. In their philosophy the straight line was the path preferred by dragons, the mythical personification of destructive power, whose violence could only be curbed by forcing it to move along curved paths. Intuitively the Chinese were aware that straight lines pro- voke and foster violent behaviour, a phenomenon on the increase world- wide. Since the beginning of the last century [1900s] there has been a rapid reduction of such visual complexity to one of virtual uniformity as this deco- ration has gradually been stripped away, reducing our built environment to a naked, stark and arid angularity. Concu rrent with this unfortunate develop- ment, and aided and abetted by the direct application of such geometry, the supremacy of rational straight-line thinking increased at the expense of the intuitive, the beaching from w i t h i n , increasingly crippling our perception of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"X The Energy Evolution Nature's subtle workings. Because of this the rational mind began to cut out important factors that were deemed extraneous, so as to achieve the most economically effective outcomes. Thus, fo r instance, the bends in rivers were truncated and the gradient steepened in order to 'improve' Nature's patterns of flow, without any account being take n of their contribution to the health and stability of the river. The result - violent discharges and inundations. Such simplicities of line not only disturb rivers, they also have a disturbing effect psychologically, because the eye, that most complex of organs requires an equal external visual complexity to ma intain its health, balance and stability, transferring such states to the brain and psyche of its host. While con- templation of the rich diversity in co lour and form of natural undisturbed forest - an apparent chaos but actually th e highest state of order - brings us a sense of peace and inner tranquillity, when we are confronted by plantation forests, planted out in rows of same-age, same-species, same-height, same- shape trees, we experience a certain inner discomfort. A higher state of order and complexity has been reduced to a lo wer one. While such a relatively small reduction produces such a reaction, what effect do more major reductions have on us psychologically? If we take the thrust and intention of Viktor Schauberger's inversion of our present reality to its logical conclusion, th en it also calls into question the valid- ity of the other artefacts we have pr oduced. If the design, shape and function of today's and earlier devices have produced such unwelcome repercussions on the external environment and our health, what effect has the design of our living spaces had on the internal e nvironment of our minds? As human beings, we are created according to Nature 's laws of organics and not those of mechanics. We therefore belong to the world of Nature, to the world of sentient, intelligent creatures. And yet, indoctrinated by history, we do not perceive that the form of our dwellings , our physically enclosing structures, is at odds with those of other creatur es; creatures whose sensitivity (which is also our birthright) is such that their intercommunion with the subtlest energies and response to the influences surrounding them is extremely inti- mate and of an order now almost totally alien to us. No natural creatures live in rigid rectangularities, but in roundnesses and curvilinear forms such as burrows, nests and shells, the latter the product of the most complex systems of curves. While Nature makes use of these forms everywhere, we do not, and through our constant use of unnatural ge ometry in all areas of endeavour, we have largely estranged ourselves from he r. We have never even thought to question the influence that continual exposure to unnatural straight lines may exert on our mental, intellectual and emotional processes, on the energies that motivate and animate us and cause us to behave in one way or another. Such is the de-sensitising effect that perh aps we will have entirely to change our"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Introduction XI living spaces in order to make possible the leap to the next higher state of awareness, to be able truly to appreciate Nature's processes and attune our- selves to them. No doubt it was for all of these reasons that Viktor Schauberger so joyfully declared: \"In the whole machine there is no straight line and no circle\". 1 By this he meant that the overall design and shape of his devices were founded on com- pletely different parameters to those of current design. Gone are the mortify- ing elements of Euclid. The effective functional surfaces and forms of these machines incorporate the swirling spirals and sinuosities, the open elements of non-Euclidean geometry so prevalent in Nature. By incorporating such organic spiral configurations and egg-shapes in such devices, energies are produced that are life-affirming in lieu of those generated by conventional machines that are presently inexorably destroying it . These energies and forces have the capacity not only to rehabilitate, enhan ce and stabilise Nature's energies, but also our own. As cooling revitalising energies, their widespread use would contribute much to the re-establishment of climatic equilibrium, which humanity's unthinking activities have so grossly thrown out of balance. Whereas in earlier days the technology to manufacture and mass-produce such devices cheaply and economically was not available, today this is no longer the case. With the advance in electronics, the only form of modern technology that emulates Nature's resonances and communicative processes, computer controlled machines can produce forms of virtually any curvilinear complexity. Coupled with the independence of movement, the freedom from hunger and want that Viktor Schaube rger's devices can provide and the present sophistication of global communi cation, humanity could be distrib- uted far more evenly over the surface of this planet. This would remove the environmentally harmful point-loads of c ities. Instead of being forced to live as human blood corpuscles, whose purpose is to maintain the flow of life- fluid in our machine-cities, we would be able to devote our energies to the evolvement of our innate creativity and to interact with Nature in the way that was always our birthright. Eventua lly wholly deserted, the deadly grid- iron conurbations of brick and aspha lt would be viewed as the cautionary relics of one of the dark ages of human history, albeit a necessary educative chapter in our evolution and without which this coming corner could not have been turned. To accomplish this, to swing wide the gateway to fresh fields of positive endeavour, all that is needed as Viktor Schauberger urges is the necessary will. 1 From Section 7.7.10: Report of Arnold Hohl's visit, 14th-17th August 1936 (Arnold Hohl) in the Special Edition of Mensch und Technik , Vol. 2, 1993. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"xii The Energy Evolution \"Our work is the embodiment of our will.

We must digest it in our inner being. The product of th is process of organic transformation is mental clarity (non-spacial energies) or the pure intuitive perception of the true reality (and the love of our Fa ther). What we formulate with our thoughts alone, consumes and destroys . For this reason today's purely con- structive technology has a consumptive effect. The machines of the future will not dest roy their fuel, but direct the energies inwardly. In this way a harmonious motion manifests itself externally, which transmutes the used material organically, exalts it and refashions it one octave higher. The residual material thus becomes endowed with the necessary potency and provided with the possibility to resurrect itself in the succeeding earthly form of life. Earth, water, air (and light) are organisms, and between them lie the organs of the most diverse nature in a constant state of readiness to act. If we bring these organs together harmoniously; if we place every inner potential opposite its outer harmonic form, then the thing begins to gyrate within and about itself and to evolve, because in rhythmical sequence every impulse is countered by an expulse, through which the harmonic motion gives way to the inflowing and diffusing counter-movement. The counter-reactive transverse electrical potentials have to be stationed opposite the strongest longitudinal magne tic potentials. Out of this normal state of opposition the harmonic transitional point is created in the golden middle. This golden middle is the organi c angle. It is the only true pathway upon which there is no upwards, no downwards, no sideways and no inwards, but only a movement in and about itself, which corresponds to the infinite will of God, the unity in the universality. Few will understand the meaning of the above! Some individuals, however, will obtain an indefinable inkling. Th is apprehension is none other than a dreamlike awakening and the incipient apotheosis of the hitherto animal mass. There is no birth without pain. Every death is followed by a birth. What we are experiencing today is a turning-point of time. Good luck to all those who understand it! Let them find one another as long as there is still time, for we are fast approaching a stupendous event. Viktor Schauberger, Vienna, May 1936 It has been proven psychologically that human beings can only appreciate or apprise, i.e. comprehend and understa nd, something new, if they can succeed in raising up the subconscious immured in their brain cells into their higher consciousness. If this cannot be achieve d, then all preaching is useless.

Viktor Schauberger in a letter to Hermann Jaeger, 31st October 1957, Implosion Magazine, No. 103, p. 20. From Special Edition Mensch und Technik, Vol. 2,1993, section 3.1 It has become clear to some that the or igins of all manifestations of life and motion lie in chemo-physical and electromagnetic causes, which on their part are triggered by plus and minus temperatures. Will and counterwill are functions of the temperatures that arise for one reason or another. Work is a function of the temperatures that lie above or below the turning point or point of intersection - the anomaly point - in which all life arises (zero-point). It is of similar nature to what we experience as the 'present', which is a function of an on-going extremely high velocity flow. This flow is an eternal motion-of-creation, which in turn gives rise to a constant creation-of-motion. 1 Thus we arrive at the fallacy and the explanation of the life that lies between birth and burial, which is the illusion that clothes evolution with reality. Temperature is thus the difference between differences, out of which the ceaseless movement of e volution arises, which is itself the product of tensions resulting from the c ontrasting directions of movement. The movement of the planets is mirrored in the movement of earthly bodies and thus the possibility also exists to order the course of such plane- tary systems by means of a particular physical motion. Conversely, it is also possible to exploit planetary motion to produce physical motion, which will enable us to harness a constantly waxing motive force for our own use. Opposites have their appointed direc tions of movement and find their expression in the mutual interaction of living and moving matter. If we can now succeed in dosing like-directional dynagens 2 and in bringing the groups of substances thus organised into mutually opposing motion, then 1 Motion of-creation and creation-of-motion: These terms relate to the German expressions 'Gestaltungsbewegung' and 'Bewegungs gestaltung', which encompass 'B ewegung' meaning 'motion' and the German concept of 'Gestalt' or 'Gestaltung', an expression that in English cannot be translated with a single word. The Collins English Dictionary defines 'G estalt' as \"a pattern or structure possessing qual- ities as a whole that cannot be described merely as a sum of its parts.\" As such it can also apply to physical, energetic and spiritual forms, matrices and structur es. 'Motion-of-creation' and 'creation-of-motion' could therefore also be respectively interpreted as 'f orm (or structure) -creating motion' and 'motion-cre- ating  form  (or  structure)'.  —  Ed.  2 Dynagen: This is one of three forms of Ethericity, a term that refers to those supra-normal, near non- dimensional, energetic, bio-electr ic, bio-magnetic, catalytic, high-fr equency, vibratory, super-potent entities of quasi-material, quasi-ether ic nature belonging to the 4th a nd 5th dimensions of being. As such these ethericities can be furt her categorised as fructigens', 'qualigens' and 'dynagens', which respectively represent those subtle energies, whos e function is the enhanc ement of fructification (fructigens), the generation of qua lity (quallgens) and the amp lification of immaterial energy (dynagens). According to their function or location these may be male or female in nature. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4 The Energy Evolution a maximal motion results, whose harmonic counterpart is the creation of the minimal form of motion, because the la tter represents the totality in a single point. This is the turning or anomaly point out of which is born the creation- of-motion from which in turn the self-enclothing motion-of-creation arises. This physical formation is the product of organic formative processes and it is obvious that in order to construct such physical forms, we must make use of certain basic shapes. This basic shape we find in the ellipse, which once set in motion, produces the mirror-image, opposite form. As the natural counterpart, the latter also creates the opposite temperament or reciprocal temperatures, which on their part give rise to the potentials and the form of motion associ- ated with them. Since we are here concerned with pur e morphological patterns, there can be no state of equilibrium and therefore that state cannot exist, which we under- stand as 'rest'. In reality this apparent rest is the very highest state of motion and at the same time the point of materi al transformation, of the ur-generation 3 of the most purely spiritual dimension, which is transformed at the speed of lightning into movement and formation, through which the thing is forcibly turned inside out and is thus energised from within. On the other hand, this two-fold motion is also the origin of life, which on its part continually trans- forms itself both without and within. If we should now succeed in maintaini ng any given substance - water, for instance - in constant state of change and transformation, then we are presented with the eternal, formative movement. This generates the creation- of-motion, which we can transform by indirect means into that which in today's terminology is described as 'energy'. With this we are well on the way to a technology that will usher in and order the coming bio-ecological age. The basic principle of this natural technology is the frictionless motion that naturally and necessarily results from the creation-of-motion innate in evo- lution, which as it evolves to a higher state of organisation, automatically 3 In Viktor Schauberger's writings in German, the pref ix 'Ur' is often separated from the rest of the word by a hyphen, e.g. 'Ur-sache' in lieu of 'Ursach e', when normally it would be joined. By this he intends to place a particular em phasis on the prefix, thus endowing it with a more profound meaning than the merely superficial. This prefix belongs not only to the German language, but in former times also to the English, a usage which has now lapsed. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, 'ur' denotes 'primitive', 'original', 'earliest', giving such examples as 'ur-Shakespear e' or 'ur-origin'. This begins to get to the root of Viktor's use of it and the deeper significance he placed upon it. If one expands upon the interpretation given in the Oxfo rd English Dictionary, then the concepts of 'primordial', 'primeval', 'primal', 'fundamental', 'e lementary', 'of first principle', come to mind, which further encompass such meanings as: — pertaini ng to the first age of the world, or of anything ancient; — pertaining to or existing from the earlie st beginnings;- constituti ng the earliest beginning or starting point;- from which something else is de rived, developed or depends ;- applying to parts or structures in their earliest or rudimentary stage; — th e first or earliest formed in the course of growth. To this can be added the concept of an 'ur-condition' or 'ur-state' of extremely high potential or potency, a latent evolutionary ripeness, which given the co rrect impulse can unloose all of Nature's innate creative forces. In the English text, th erefore, the prefix 'ur' will also be used wh erever it occurs in the original German and the reader is asked to b ear the above in mind when reading what follows. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Some Philosophical Aspects of Natural Energies 5 vacates the place it occupied and in this way gives rise to the counter-motion of the surplanting body. Conclusions From Spec. Ed. Mensch und Technik, Vol. 2,1993, section 10.0 (Notes from April 1941) \"We must look into unknown dimensions, into Nature, into that incalculable and imponder- able life, whose carrier and mediator, the blood of the Earth that accompanies us steadfastly from the cradle to the grave, is water.\" Viktor Schauberger, 1932, Implosion Magazine, No. 103, p. 28 \"Whoever accelerates the media of earth, water and air centrifug ally perishes unconditionally, for in so doing they reduce the Blood of the Earth (water) to a pathogenic state and make it the most dangerous enemy of all living and growing things.\" Viktor Schauberger, Implosion Magazine, No. 96, p. 4. In Nature there are only structures and orifices. From these arise all forms of materialisation and dematerialisation, if orifices and vessels are organised in an inversely symmetrical configuration and within them the reciprocal gaseous substances are correctly dose d. Pressure and suction, and most important of all, the temperature-gradient should be aligned in the right sense (+ not -), through which the desired energy is freed at the point of intersection. T his can be accumulated if the thing is cooled during its motion, becoming homogenously structured in the process. In this manner it is even possible to decompose ordinary air into animalistic electrical essences, or to produce an a r t i f i c i a l thunderstorm, whose transformative essences discharge into metal conductors, calling into being a physi cal vacuum with which a thunderstorm can be produced in the tube, whos e power exceeds that of a cyclone. While it is still necessary to use small quantities of earthly substances in the artificial production of petrol (gasoline), no fuels of any kind are needed to operate the air-turbine 4 . This will avert the crisis that will inevitably ensue if nature-alienated humanity continues to combust substances in its machines, which are preordained by Nature for the provision of food. The seemingly remarkable behaviour of liquids under the influence of light is the totally natural permanent condition of the eternal 'Arising' and 'Passing Away', of the evolution from small to large and vice versa, whose vital harmony Goethe has already explained to us so b eautifully that all we need to do is read his works so as to create the perp etual interaction required by all mole- cules in order to exist in a state of well-behaved order.

Today's technology mistakenly chose the former of the two processes and it is therefore no wonder that cancer is on the rampage here, there and everywhere. Goethe said, \"The driving wheels of Nature are polarity and intensification and whoever understands enough to untie also knows enough to bind.\" What is born in light, disintegrates in the coolness of the ground. It rises up and returns again as a ray of energy in order to quicken that which stands ready to become new life at the boundary between space and volume. Every leaf is an animalistic magnet in monoplanar form, which attracts and radiates, depending on whether the Sun shines on it or cold caresses it. This great law of reciprocity also operates in water, which constantly restructures itself by altering its space and volume. The space is shaped by light and heat. The volume is a product of darkness a nd coolness. If we understand how to apportion the opposing relation between sp ace and volume and how to organ- ise its intrinsic structure, then the s ubstance - water - will become 'The Space' and the formless volume its realisation, which is transformed instantaneously with heat-pressure, thereby creating the motion that fills the over-lying inter- space. If nature-alienated humanity, however, reverses this purposeful process and combusts precisely those substances that occasion life, then they should no longer be surprised when the Sun burns up that which serves it as an inter- mediate space, and which serves humankind for the maintenance of life. Life unfolds itself in three spheres: 1. in the Carbone 5 -sphere 2. in the Atmosphere 3. in the Stratosphere The connection between these spheres is created by water. Conversely, the various states of aggregation of water form the bridges for the formation and reconstitution of the basic elements carri ed by water, which succeed in reach- ing the Earth's interior from the stra tosphere and vice versa. The purely mechanical circulation of the physical form - water - operates in the opposite direction to the circulation of energy. The rising of the C-substances with their carrier - water - is countered by the sinking of the oxygen. Where these 5 Carbone: In contrast to the normal use and defin ition of 'carbon', Viktor Sc hauberger grouped all the known elements and their compounds, with the exception of oxygen and hydrogen, under the general classification of 'Mother Substances', which he described with the word 'Kohle-stoffe', normally spelt 'Kohlenstoffe' and meaning car bon. Apart from the above defin ition the hyphen also signifies a higher aspect of carbon, both physically and energeti cally or immaterially.

These energetic interactions can never reach a state of r est due to the constant variation in the length of night and day. Inevitably therefore, there is a continual shift in the individual microclimatic conditions, whic h further result in variations in the quantity and quality of the basic elements. The outcome of this incessant reciprocal activity on the one hand is the reconstitution of the various kinds of water present in the individual zones, and on the other, the constant transfor mation of the species of vegetation in which water makes its way, ceaselessly moved by this inner interplay of forces. This inner, energetic interaction, however, is opposed by the effect of the water's weight. The alternating magnitudes of these component forces inevitably lead to the constant rising a nd falling of the water particles - the so- called pulsation of water. Every new form ation and all growth is derived from the smallest beginnings. Continuing deve lopment in the early stages can only be accomplished if the circulation in the Earth's interior proceeds correctly. According to inner law, every higher form of vegetation is built up from the lower species preceding it. The carrier of the substances and the transmitter of the life-processes in the root-zone is the groundwater. The impulse for its movement is caused by a drop in temper ature, to which the inner metabolic processes of the here decisive groups of basic elements give rise. The impulse for the movement of water is thus a product of the interactions between the opposites contained within it, which find their necessary resist- ance in the water itself. Through the resistance arising from the interactions between carbone and oxygen, fluctuati ons in temperature again occur and with them the impulse to move - the pulsation of water, which in this way at times dissolves salts and at others deposits them, transports them, creates energies and transforms them. The sense and purpose of these perpetual transformation processes is the creation and maintenance of the various types of vegetation and physical forms, wh ich on their part again represent the bridges for the build-up and maintenance of the energies. The potential differences in constant existence between inner and outer temperatures are none other than forms of energy, which complete the cycle of water and at the same time kindle it anew. Evolutionary manifestations are therefore, 1, of material, and 2. of immaterial nature. Stone, plant, animal, human being, planet and Sun are organisms possessed of body and soul.

If they lose their place of abode with the decaying of the body, then they are willingly taken up by the water that eternally circulates in, on and above the Earth and which conducts them once more to a new life. Therefore wherever we look there is life, constant formation and transfor mation. Should we look into apparent emptiness, then a sea of spiritual life, passed and future generations, returns our gaze. Every material form of vegetation is always the reflection of an immaterial form consisting of light, heat and radiation. Every change in sphere changes the out er and inner relations of the whole, changes the weight and the intensity of the inner radiation of water and thus the direction in which this carrier of life moves. Disturbances to the inner and outer conformities with natural law lead to a disturbance in the organisation of the whole evolution of life. The di sappearance of water or its substantial transformation is a very serious warning sign, because the character of the water also changes with its inner com position, and with this the character of all forms of life, including human -beings. The qualitative decline of the vegetation and above all the deteriorati on of the highest plant-organism - the forest, the psychic and moral degeneration of humankind, are only the legiti- mate consequence of the disturbance of the physical composition of water and the disruption of the geosphere occasioned by humanity's subversive activity in the organism of the Earth. What we are experiencing today is no crisis, but rather the demise of the whole, i.e. the qualitative, physical degeneration of all organisms, brought into effect through the disturbance of Nature's water-balance. In step with this devolution goes the moral, mental and spiritual collapse of humanity, which has already reached such an adva nced state, that despite all warning signs people still do not recognise the seriousness of the situation. Worse than animals, they seek their final salvation in the decimation of humanity with weapons of war, that our priests ev en bless along with the banners under which our children are supposed to bleed to death. The decision, whether we take the latter path or whether at the final hour we can protect ourselves from our own self-mutilation, only lies with us, or with those men of science and the state, who take upon themselves an altogether appalling responsibility, when out of pers onal interest, with no consideration of the gravity of the situation and being incapable of bringing any effective help, they continue to adhere to their present point of view."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Some Philosophical Aspects of Natural Energies 9 The Biological Vacuum - The Optimal Driving Force for Machines An amalgam of articles from Implosion Magazine, Nos. 29 (pp 27-31), 53 (pp. 24-29) & 109 (pp 9-17), written 8th July 1954. \"The scientist states that pressure is exerted ou twards in all directions equally, whereas natural pressure (e.g. air pressure) is exerte d inwards from all directions equally.\" Viktor Schauberger, Implosion Magazine, No. 114, p.29. A few years ago my so-called pioneering patents were applied for in 26 coun- tries. In almost every country the pate nt assessors declared that I was mad and some of them even refused to eval uate the patent applications. Of these about half have been granted to date. The remainder are about to be granted, although their possible practical application has not been understood by a single patent assessor. The substantiation of these patent claims, however, could not be refuted in the preliminary assessment. During this period the German patent attorney, who had been preparing my foreign patent appli- cations, told me that all at once there had been second thoughts and that my patents had been granted one after the other. The truth of my observation had thus been recognised as correct. Th eir granting was therefore compulsory. This change of opinion had been provoked by very strenuous counter- arguments during the preliminary hearings as well as through the publication of various articles in so-called 'serious' scientific journals. As a case in point for example, the ma gazine 'Das Univer sum' reported that the smaller Swiss lakes were already as good as ruined, where contemporary turbine systems had been installed in the upper and lower reaches of their affluent streams. Indeed in many large Swiss lakes and in many German and other lakes, the mysterious deterioration of both lake and river water had been elected. In its issue of the 9th of June 1954, the Hamburg periodical 'Der Spiegel' reported that at present at least 10,000 million marks would have to be outlaid in Germany in order to rectify the most blatant depredations in the mismanagement of water resources. The German rivers are polluted to such an extent that even the best filtration pl ants are virtually useless.

The sicker the organism, the more agile its destroyers become. In the aforementioned patent applica tions it was stated in no uncertain terms, where the causes of these regressive symptoms, including cancer, were to be sought, which imperil all growth and highly evolved forms of life. In these applications I made the observation that it was the method of moving water techno-academically which in every respect is destructive and which is solely responsible for the economic declin e, the rise in social privation and the constant increase in political unrest. Techno-academic motion is so called, because it is taught in all academies and universities in the form of the cen- trifugence of medial structures (earth, water and air) and in every dictionary it is described as an 'unnatural' (unreal) fo rm of acceleration. In spite of this it is used today in all areas of industr y in its exceptionally centrifugating form, because no other method of acceleration is known. It will therefore continue to be used everywhere until a more rational source of power is discovered. Observations over many years of the almost motionless stationary trout in rushing mountain streams led to the discovery of the best and cheapest source of mechanical power. It is a form of energy that promotes healthy growth and will free humanity from the technology that presently enslaves it. Founded on a biological vacuum, it will provide the basis for a quantitative and qualitative increase in productivity, thereby solv ing the pressing problem of more and more people and less and less food. The political turmoil now apparent every- where can easily lead to the third and last World War, which if atom bombs are used, will mean the end of civilisation. This should certainly be reason enough to consider the following seriously even though it may appear utopian at first sight, an aspect that should offer no further impediment once the academic expertise derived from th e misinterpretation of fundamentals collapses like a house of cards. Nor should it be rejected because many occu- pations that are more or less parasitic will be eliminated in the process. We are here concerned with the existence or non- existence of millions of people in all countries of the world. For more than a century it has been known that water emits ionising radi- ation, if it is discharged through a syst em of straight jets under pressure (see figs. 1-3 6 ). Hitherto unknown, however, was the following: If these rays are braked by a filter composed of fatty substances (paraffin wax) and conducted in bundled form into a vacuum-tube , then they incandesce on the inner surfaces, producing a dark red, strongly pulsating glow when the tube is earthed. This effect is similar to sheet -lightning. If these rays are amplified in Leyden jars and then conducted into inflammable liquids or gases, they ignite the latter. This is how the fire starte d in the Hindenburg, which was filled with hydrogen and became earthed when its ballast-water was released.

W ith fire an approximately 1,800-fold increase in volume occurs, whereas the reverse metamo rphosis of helium into water is associated with an 1,800-fold reduction in volume. This reduced volume is the 'biological vacuum', which is the result of chain-reactions and is an ideal source of motive power. In biotechnical machines a vacuum is initially created through the volume-reducing function of the whorl-pipes through which, in a process of repulsion, energy can be drawn off.

Via a Viennese intermediary, my advice was sought as to whether this could explain the a pparently unstoppable increase in the infection and decay of water, sap and blood, which is also responsible for every kind of water catastrophe. The actual impetus for these enquiries arose as a result of Professor Otto Warburg's study of cancerous tumours under the microscope. He determined that they were nourished principally by oxygen 8 . Plants too are supposed to obtain up to 80% of their nutrients from the positively overcharged atmosphere. I reject this assertion, because oxygen is no nutrient, but the substance that fertilises the oppositely-charged (geosphe ric) fructigenic ethericities. These enter the plants via the protoplasm at the tips of the roots (see fig. 15). In more highly organised life-forms they enter the hermetically sealed blood- or sap-streams by way of the intestinal filtration systems; in other words, by way of diffusion. They then proceed through the diffusive orifices of the leaves, needles, gills and lungs and make possible the intermixtures upon whose character and capacity of accommodation the formation of pathogenic or animating entities depends, which at this time are in an atomic state. Animating energies come into being when etherealised (helium-like) ethericities of carbone and the condensed waste of solar energy in gaseous form, so-called oxygen, become bound together and emulsify. This happens when the intermixture of diffuse s ubstances takes place where a process of reduction occurs in lieu of oxidation. Whether animating or de-animating life -forces come into being is dependent on the way these substances intermix. The life-giving impulse can only be stimulated, if etherealised carbone (h elium-like) ethericities bind the waste products of solar energy that materialis e in the form of gas, i.e. so-called oxygen. On the other hand, decomposiv e, life-removing forces will be stimu- lated if the process of interaction proceeds in the reverse order. That is to say, if the oxygen ethericities bind the maternal ethericities of carbone. When heated, oxygen becomes aggressive, whereas with cold it becomes passive. 7 This patent is not to be confused with French patent No. 1.057.576, which relates to the double-spi- ral pipe described under 'Processes and Equipment fo r the Conveyance of Liquid, Gaseous or Aeriform Media', p. 107 of this book. It may thus apply to another patent, perhaps for a Repulsator or Repulsine. On the other hand , since both numbers are virtually the same except for one digit, it may also be a typographical error. — Ed. 8 See Gastons Naessens' research into the effect of nitrogen on cancer.

In the forest this is manifested in the enlargement of the annual rings in over-illuminated, shade-demanding species of timber. Thus is also revealed the cause of the huge spread of the scourge of the technical age - cancer, whose actuator comes to life in decadent cells through over-acidified food, in drinking and cooking water, a nd in air polluted by exhaust fumes. Here too we encounter tree-cancer, to which these decadent cells give rise and which is transferred to the tree by over-acidified nutrients. Iron molecules are particularly dangerous, if they are sw ept up into the atmosphere along with the fumes from iron-smelting blast-furnaces, for as catalysts they contribute to the interaction between low-grad e elements and inaugurate conditions conducive to lung-cancer.

For this reason the view that this relates to viral entities released by wa ter, sap and blood, is an error of the first order.

In response to the objections raised during the preliminary patent assessment, I then submitted the fo llowing supplementary explanation: 1. As inseparable trinities, the media of earth, water and air are the natural accumulators of biomagnetic and bioelectric dynagen concentrates. These are extremely sensitive to pressure and heat and may only be accelerated artificially in the original (primordial) way, i.e. planetarily, wherein cool- ing effects must predominate. Any abnormal increase in heat, no matter from what cause, triggers unnatural in teractions betwee n basic elements at the expense of the negatively surcharged, biomagnetic dynagen concentrates. 2.

In the tissues minute explosions occur, which result in their destruction.

In German the term for shear force is'Schubkraft', mean- ing 'to push, to shove' as well as 'to shear', wherea s Viktor Schauberger uses the word 'Schleppkraft'. The verb 'schleppen' means to drag, draw or pull. Vi ktor Schauberger's choice of 'Schleppkraft' here is quite specific, since in his view the movement of sedi ment is due to the suckin g action of fast flowing, dense cold water downstream, rather than to the mechanical impact of the water coming from upstream. In view of this subtle change in emphasi s, in lieu of the hydrauli cally correct term 'shear force', the term 'tractive fores' will be used.

I have named it 'Qualigen' 11 . This can only come into being, if all medial masses (water, earth, air, etc.) are accelerated 'originally' - planetarily and predominantly centripetally by me ans of patented devices designed to create this form of motion. The design and the alloys used in the construction of these devices, which are continually be ing improved, are the exact opposites of those used in all areas of industry fo r the techno-academic acceleration of mass. My allegations in this regard were c onstrued an as affront to the honour and prestige of the Establishment and I was requested to provide written proof of these provocative assertions to the uni versity professors I mentioned by name. This I also did and without excep tion they all had to capitulate. I could prove to them that as a result of techno-academic systems of motion - a pre- dominantly centrifugal form of mass-movement - an atomic (electrolytic) excess pressure builds up in the structure of the basic elements, thereby pro- ducing an increase in temperature; in other words, a feverish condition. In contrast, an atomic (magnetic) low or negative pressure is generated through a form of planetary mass-motion in which centripetence predominates. This gives rise to a concentrative, negativ e pressure, which functions as a biologi- cal vacuum. It was discovered as early as 1908 by Professor Ernst Ferdinand Sauerbruch, who recognised that neithe r breathing nor expansion of the lungs would be possible if the biological vacuum were not to exist. He was declared a fool all the same and dismissed without notice when he told his superior, Professor Mikolitsch, the following: \"Were there no vacuum between the surface of the lungs and the pleura, no intake of breath, nor resistanceless expansion of the lung s would be possible. Everything would suffocate were this bio- logical vacuity to be filled w ith normal, atmospheri c pressure through any form of perforation.\" Professor Sauerbruch was unaware that this vacuum comes into being through the planetary movement of the blood. Had he known, then medicine would have taken a completely different course. I was further able to prove that because contemporary machines operate using centrifugence, resistances to motion with a reactive 12 function are 11 Here the German word is 'Qualitatstoff', which litera lly means 'quality-matter, or substance'.

In a certain sense this can be interpreted as the application of a brake by a violated Nature. With the use of my patented suction-screws (see figs. 4 & 5) on the other hand, performance and efficiency are increased in the same ratio through molecular processes wherein quality is built up, with the result that over-unity energies can be generated. The product of this involuting motion, which always converges to a point while at the same time curling in upon it self, is biomagnetism. That it is also contingent on the presence of catalytic influences will not be further dis- cussed here. As such, biomagnetism exte nds itself longitudinally and radiates its surplus energies vertically and, for example, draws the trout along in its wake. The trout can so regulate this ups uctional force with its gills that even its motionless stance and equally well-known mastery of gravity becomes understandable in the light of the above. The weight of physical masses only exists in the atmospheric living space. Above this the force of levitation pre- vails as inverted gravitation. Consequent ly, all pressure- and heat-intensifying motion must inevitably function all the more irrationally uneconomically and development-impedingly, the more it is accelerated and strengthened. To this end raw materials are squandered to such a degree that a growing dearth of them is unavoidable. An exact chemical analysis revealed that over-acidified products of emulsion are created by present systems of mass-motion. In contrast, a 100% biomag- netically surcharged concentrate of qua ligen is produced by planetary forms of motion. When infused into drinki ng water, it greedily binds excessive agglomerations of oxygen and purg es the body. Cancerous tumours and growths become neutralised in the process and it is therefore the natural pre- ventive of cancer and indeed the means of healing it. Science was never able to discover these things as all it knew was the opposite form of mass-motion that has caused all the havoc in the worl d.

As a logical consequence, therefore, over-illuminated and / or overheated mountain springwaters must sink and their sources dry up. An investigation carried out with a mi croscope has confirmed that crystalline structures form under technical forms of motion; that planetary motion produces morphous structures (see fig. 6). These are the typical indicator of high-grade interactions of diffuse s ubstances, whose products of emulsion effortlessly overcome all physical weight and mental inertia. This heaviness will be increased, however, if any form of medial mass is made to move in the way that occurs today throughout the civilised world.

In the light of this, the deterioration of rivers and lakes beco mes quite understandable. Since bio- magnetism is quality, it follows that there is no constant conservation of energy in the presently accepted sense. There is likewise no equivalence between mass and energy and no insupe rable force of gravity within the atmospheric envelope. All there is, is a rhythmical interplay between bipolar component forces, which ultimately inaugurates the final degeneration. In their interactive function as atomic pressural or suctional forces and through the biological vacuum thereby created, they also produce the best and cheapest driving force for machines. As a result of all this the scales fell from the eyes of an ecclesiastical scholar, when I explained to him that the earthly remains of life (mineral and metallic trace-elements) were essential for the processes of reproduction, regeneration and upward evolution.

The Catalysts Sherman, Texas, 28th August 1958, from Implosion Magazine, No. 123, pp 12-17. When Robert Dormer's two representatives asked me to explain the essential nature of implosion, I told them that the correct choice of catalysts was one of the decisive preconditions for the success of a high-grade emulsion (the inner intermixture of bipolar basic elements). In this regard science defines a catalyst as a substance that alters th e speed of a reaction by acceleration or deceleration. For the chemis t catalysis signifies 'dissolution', whereas viewed bio-catalytically this is understood as the 'release' from inner urges and yearn- ing. As this explanation is unscientific and therefore of little 'use', various examples will be examined in order to explain the concept of 'bio-catalysts', while not exactly scientifically, nevertheless naturalesquely. It is known, for example, that for the liquefaction of brown coal (lignite) appropriate catalysts are required. Here there is no uniformi ty, because every- thing is bipolar and therefore it is necessary to make a clear distinction between positive and negative catalysts. The chemical reaction itself is of no interest biologically speaking, and the whole thing must be considered from a higher standpoint, otherwise it would be impossible, for example, to liquefy hard coal (anthracite), i.e. to transfer it to the next higher state of evolvement. This also applies to calcium (combusted marble) and other insoluble basic substances. That a falling temperature gr adient is of decisive importance for biological processes of development, has already been emphasised elsewhere. Since science, which thinks too mechanistically, has also failed to grasp this, it would unable to understand the naturale sque interpretation of the concept of 'reaction', which here is to be understood as a process of ur-genesis. Without this there would be no reproduction or further development, which is responsible for higher-grade emulsions, namely the inner fusion (marriage) of etherialised primary substances in the 4th spacial dimension. As long as the"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"22 The Energy Evolution precondition for development is not unde rstood, the biological regeneration and qualitative improvement of cont aminated and polluted drinking and domestic water will be impossible. This involves the retro-transformation of degenerate fresh water or undrinka ble seawater into high-grade high- mountain springwater. If such ennobled water is drunk, which accumulates normally insoluble trace-elements in a 'released' state and binds its oxygen content up to a maxi- mum of 4% 13 , then the dissolution of normally insoluble sediment accretions takes place, enabling sclerosis, encrus tation of the blood, sap and lymph vessels to be healed. The organisms thus treated regain their metabolic func- tions as well as their reproductive abilities. In this way senile men almost fully recover their virility. After extended consumption of regenerated drinking water, even people who wear glasses can use weaker ones, because the cap- illaries of the eye, which supply it with high quality nutrients, will be purged of deposits. Rheumatic disorders are cured within a short space of time, for through this general detoxification the joints move freely and painlessly again and are provided with a film of essential oils. Kidney and gall stones also dissolve after only a few weeks of drinki ng such healing water and are passed out in gravel-like form with the urine. All those suffering from cancer can get relief from their tearing pains almost immediately, because the almost oxygen- free water binds the excess oxygen in the blood 14 , thus eliminating dangerous hyperacidity. It is therefore not only possi ble to prevent cancer in this way, but even to cure this dreadful disease, if this all-healing water is drunk in good time. The healing of rheumy eyes with the aid of gold earrings also occurs in a similar way. Situated in the earlobes - the coolest location, they function bio- catalytically and make any form of water secretion impossible. If one burns one's finger, then almost intuitively one grasps the earlobe, where the relatively strongest falling temperature gradient prevails, and an almost instantaneous relief from the burning sensati on is felt. Catalysts in the form of the emanations from gold and silver no t only function oligodynamically (they kill pathogenic bacteria), but also bui ld up apathogenic bacteria, as happens in the vicinity of high springs. Having recognised this, a very open-minded doctor, the director of the old peoples' home at Lainz near Vienna, attempted to cure the sclerotic symptoms of ser iously rheumatic W.W.II soldiers by administering the finest gold and silver dust. He only achieved a partial cure, however, because this can only be done with the infusion of precious metals in an organic state. 13 This is slightly equivocal and can be interprete d in two ways: Either 4% of the 100% oxygen content is bound, or, up to 4% of the 100% oxygen content is bound, namely 96%.

Dr Zuckerkandl, a forensic scientist who presently lives in Paris, analysed organic metals that I had ur-produced as long as 20 years ago. To his huge astonishment, he confirmed my assertion that metals of all kinds actu- ally grow. This should be understood as the incarnation of ions, which for the first time correctly explains the gene rally accepted concept of 'growth'. This involves the solidification of stocks of bipolar dynagens under the influence of gentle and diffuse heat (viz. the high ly metalliferous egg-shaped stones, for example, which emit a golden yellow glow even when rubbed together under water - the legendary Rhinegold and Gold of the Nibelungs. This has nothing to do with flints, which in any case do not spark under water.) Therefore it is also a mistake to believe that plants breathe in carbones and breathe out oxygen, which can be proven as follows: If the tips of enclosed stands of conifers are observed on very warm and windless days at about noon, then delicate transparent wraith s of mist can be seen, which waft upwards and disintegrate on expos ure to excessive light and heat. 15 This is a sign that decentrating forms of emulsion are taking place. That is, the upwardly radiating carbones, which beco me passive (inactive) with strong light and heat, are being bound by th e aggressive oxygen influence, which happens under a negative (rising) temper ature gradient. In my own experi- ence this also leads to the drying up of high-lying true springs, which can only rise under conditions where the oxyge n is in a diffuse state. If these vapour formations appear above the tops of the trees, then it is certain to rain after about 4 hours. This prompted watchf ul foresters of old, who were close to Nature, to pack a raincloak in thei r rucksacks for the afternoon shift.

This happens, because di amagnetically charged levitational forces come into being in a similar wa y as occurs in natural mixed forests, whose temperature in winter and summer constantly remains close to the anomaly zone of the interspersed water (+4°C - 39.2°F). This healing zone is sought out by sick and wounded animals, which go there to regain their health or to die a painless death. These sick beds, or surgical beds as experi- enced huntsmen called them, are also to be found in the water immediately below high-grade springs to which wounded game comes and to which the naturalistic huntsman hurries by the shortest route, where he finds the wounded creature dying in the healing water and puts it out of its agony with a coup-de-grace. During early and late frosts experienced farmers protect their blossoming orchards by spraying water onto iron or steel plates through a system of para- magnetic 16 nozzles, which results in an imme diate rise in temperature of about 6°C (10.8°F) in the crown zone. This water cannot mix with the differently charged surrounding air and remains unchanged even under the severest frost. This works incomparably bette r than artificial smoke generators (smudge pots), which are also known to protect the delicate blooms against freezing. If the above process is carried out with copper nozzles, then a con- spicuous cooling occurs in the crown z one, which can be used to safeguard sensitive young shoots and protect them from scorching. This is especially necessary in the case of young light- and heat-sensitive seed-stock, which are often shielded from sunburn with leafy cuttings. The simplest effect of catalytic opposites, i.e. fine-structured opposites with inner interuniting properties, or more properly having a 'm arrying' tendency (ur-procreation), can best be observed in the generation of electric current, which is normally only successfully achieved with so-called dynamos in- corporating rotors made of paramagnetic metal. Conversely, if diamagnetic catalysts are used in dynamos constructed in exactly the opposite way (so-called Repulsators - see fig. 7 & figs. 24 ->26), then an upward flowing diamagnetism is pr oduced, which viewed biologically is to be understood as 'levitation' (resurr ective or upsuctional force), during which the follow-up pressure mentioned elsewhere plays a subordinate role. If the developmental process is initiated in reverse order, where the pressural components predominate, then super-strong gravitational forces are freed. 16 List of paramagnetic and diamagnetic elements: 1.

Modern intuitionless science has regulated the eternal flow of evolution (panta Rhei) in the wrong way and thus failed to notice the possibility of generating ur-forces. Instead of additional products of emulsion possessing development-enhancing f unctions, it had to make do with development- disturbing reactive forces and resist ances to motion that increase by the square of the reversed form of accelera tion. According to an age-old maxim, \"she half-pulled him down, he half-sank on her\". In this play on words there lies a far deeper meaning. It would take too lo ng here to enumerate all the catalysts with various functions, which as Goethe already recognised, form the 'con- necting' (emulsifying) bond. They are ray-forms, upon whose function the development-disturbing rising temperat ure gradient and the development- fostering falling temperature gradient depend. Paramagnetic catalysts act decentratingly diamagnetic catalysts con centratingly. This fact alone pin- points the incorrect form of development, which ultimately results in the destruction of atoms. Wise Nature, on the other hand, proceeds by way of atomic transformation, which from, a biological viewpoint is the exact oppo- site. Pressure and fire technology therefore produce retrogressive atomic energies, whereas implosion technology generates super-powerful, forward- thrusting atomic energies, i.e. an almo st 100% formative and levitative force. And so the question arises, what actually is a catalyst? The answer is simple. It is a condenser that has been galvan ically alloyed with oppositely-charged substances, which radiates predominan tly negatively potentiated ray-forms into the naturalesquely (inwindingly) moved medium. This then activates a flowing diamagnetism, the formative a nd levitative force that soars upwards and sucks the generating device up in its wake, and which can be regulated by the rate of rotation. With this, the force was rediscovered that enables air- craft to overcome gravity effortlessly and stationary machines to be powered for virtually nothing. According to accounts from earlier times, the high priests of ancient cultures had a commanding knowledge of this power, which they cherished and guarded like lif e itself so as to be venerated as Gods for their skill. By now it ought to be quite clear that the self-accelerating economic decline now taking place throughout the whole civilised world is the biological consequence of the pre-emptive regulatio n of the eternal flow of evolution, and that it is high time to rectify this grave error in motion against which humanity is lost.

The pressure turbine On the 16th of May 1913 Prof. Dr. Viktor Kaplan was able to inform the world's leading turbine manufacturers that he had succeeded in achieving rotational velocities and efficiencies with his newly designed impeller, which far exceeded existing norms. This was confirmed by Prof. Budau at the test stand on the 22nd of June 1922. With this Kaplan saw himself at the culmination of years-long experi- mental endeavours, when suddenly an unexpected setback occurred, causing a severe nervous breakdown which crippled his ability to work. When what had been achieved experimentally with the test model was implemented practically, mysterious cavitation phenomena appeared, which destroyed even steel turbine blad es within a short space of time. It was only after protracted and expens ive experiments with alloys that these decomposive phenomena could be sufficiently inhibited to enable the manu- facture of this turbine system to begin. This was believed and is still so believed today, to be of such great service to industry and the economy, that a few companies licensed by Kaplan (because of the lucrative business opportunities) spared no material expense or intellectual effort in order to eliminate these decomposive effects, wh ich according to measurements were equivalent to peak pressures of about 32,000 atmospheres (atm)."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Some Philosophical Aspects of Natural Energies 29 In this way this dangerous centrif ugence-machine was rescued from obliv- ion, which decomposes the geospheric and therefore negatively charged mother-water of the Earth (the true carri er of fructigens) in ever wider circles as the turbine's rate of rotation ri ses with increasing head of pressure. The cause of this groundwater decomposition is the emission of analysing substances, namely cadaverine poison in ray-form (ptomaine radiation), which arises from liquefied stocks of fatty-matter when mechanically-induced centrifugal pressure and physically dissociative energies trigger lower- grade (expansive) temperatures, i.e. lower-grade cell vibrations, in molecular structures. Here we are concerned with the consequences of a tragic error inasmuch as it is generally believed that the earthly remains of life, which relapse into the womb of the Earth, purposelessly decay into dust and ashes when the soul is supposedly separated from its former body after its physical vital functions have ceased. In reality there are two mutually opp osed fermentation processes (forms of inner motion) that determine what is to be created from these allotropic (poly- morphic) fat-concentrates entombed in the Earth along with the cadaver. Decomposive and retrogressive energies - the above ptomaine radiation - are active here, which are generated when the reversed fermentation process that produces positively charged acids is triggered by thermal influences which intensify internal (r upturing) pressures. This is further exacerbated by the disintegrative effect of mechanics, which bio-logic-ally speaking gives rise to reactivated centrifugal motion. It thus becomes clear that in Nature there are neither equivalencies, nor any consta nt conservation of energy or matter, but only differentiations, which mu tually potentiate one another. Robert Mayer, Isaac Newton and others devoid of intuition - therefore nature-alienated lawmakers - have seriously erred (exact proof of this exists) inasmuch as in an eternally changing Nature there are actually no rigid laws, no domas or absolutes, but only a rhythmical interplay of energies, which determine the fate of all existence. 17 This is because the products of this inter- play, already in an atomic state, have an in-built capacity to react, and are therefore products of bio-logical development. Just a slight positively surcharged motive or stimulative influence is enough to discharge the blood of the Earth, the extremely pressure-sensitive accumu- lator of the true life-forces in statu nascendi, which it accumulates in order to transform them into reactivated formativ e (levitative) or disintegrative (retro- gressive) energies.

However, if it is moved and churned up by high-speed pressure-turbines, hydraulic river regula tions or cascade-like torrent confine- ments, then lower-grade forms of char ge and potential give rise to positively supercharged effluxes of energy, which radiate in all directions (this can be proven exactly), pierce through and di scharge all resistances, and through internal rupture, loosen the water's st ructure, thus corrupting the character and the quality of this dynagen concentration (see fig. 6). As also happens with rapidly m oving tractor-drawn iron (steel) ploughs 18 , this gives rise to electrolytic dissocia tive effects and detonating-gas-like erup- tions (so-called earth-rumbles) over a wide area, which further enlarge the structures mechanically that have alread y been pre-loosened up through their inner excitation. That is to say, the above forms of inner motion and excitation mutually amplify one another by way of such chain-reactions, whose periodicity rises by the square of the ro tational velocity. On the one hand the products decisive for development are ur-created, i.e. the buoyant atomic forces (levitation) that effortlessly overcome all physical weight, and on the other, those retrogressive energies, which mortify all life through the enlarge- ment of the tissue-structure. Therefore either the cadaverine poison in ray-form or the life-elixir in an atomic state is created, which overcomes all disease. This explains why, for example, th e resistance to motion increases by the square of the unnatural (centrifugal) rotational velocity in all technical, hydraulic and dynamic pressure- and heat-increasing machines. This, how- ever, does not occur if medial masses (ear th, water & air) are accelerated 'orig- inally' in the manner of the natural mo tion of the Earth's mass (see fig. 9), namely centripetally along the longitudinal axis.

Undoubtedly known to the high-priests of ancient cultures, these con- centrates of noble matter (ethericities) ar e responsible for the legendary near- absolute abundance of food and the freedom of movement associated with it. Incidentally, these concentrates were also ultimately responsible for the disaster of Atlantis, referred to as the Flood by a circumspect Church, which was the result of the careless control of these elemental levitative energies. In this respect the Church was quite ri ght, because the negatively potentiated mother-water (amniotic fluid), the physically first-born, will be precipitated out by these formative and levitative energies (there is exact proof of this). It is in this ennobled carrier-substance, however, that the latent higher-grade atomic energies reside, which make na turally ordained locomotion possible. These energies, however, can be transformed into the most developmentally harmful forms of atomic energy if, for example, a cyclotron-like centrifugating device is employed as the supposedly correct means for producing energy. Hitherto it has not been known that vitamins, the concentrates of noble matter (perfectly developed fat-format ions fermented under the exclusion of light and heat, which are known to solidify at death) can be degraded through inferior (expansively-acting) influen ces of heat and light and are gradually transformed into the atomic ptomaine radiation mentioned at the beginning, Only recently has so-called vacuum-d istillation been applied to obtaining high-grade fat-concentrates from essential oils. For this, however, only atmospheric-gas-rarefying devices, air-suction or air-pressure pumps are used, which can never emulate the processes that wise Nature employs for specifically densifying these highest-grade concentrates of ennobled matter. This is the 'Organic' vacuum. Created by a centripetence-machine, it densities noble matter through the co-active influences of higher-grade motion and contractile stimuli. That is to say, the moved (accelerated) mass approaches the temperatureless and feverless anomal y state (+4°C - +39.2°F), which is only possible through mass-acceleration on the longitudinal axis. Nor can the resist- ance to motion mentioned earlier evolve during this process for the simple reason that this 'original' system of mass motion and acceleration, the dis- sociative, structure-loosening, positive temperature influences are missing, which would otherwise induce an increase in dangerous wall-pressures. It should be noted that it is entirely immaterial whether a molecular inter- action between basic elements is ini tiated by a physical or metaphysical motion-excitation combination.

For this reason the blood-of-the-Earth-centrifugating Kaplan tu rbine is one of the first machines that must be eliminated as fast as possible. If this is done, it will still be possible at the eleventh hour to arrest an economic and cultural decline with all its perilous political repercussions throughout the civilised world, which will have been caused by the generation of lower-grade atomic energies. The suction turbine The suction-turbine (see figs. 30-33) is the most suitable device for countering this event, for it can ur-produce th e most noble formative and levitative energies from water, which function at an atomic level. It builds up the Earth's amniotic fluid, which all t oday's technical, hydraulic and chemo- dynamic machines, conveyances and agri cultural implements, etc. decom- pose; in particular the high-speed, blood-of-the-Earth-centrifugating Kaplan turbines and Pelton wheels. Under the term 'suction turbine' is to be envisaged an inverted pressure tur- bine. It is an apparatus with which wa ter can be densified mechanically and physically, therefore 'specifically', at the same time. By being moved in this way, the anomaly state so vital to life, th e temperatureless and feverless condition of health, can be attained regardless of any positive temperature influences. This 'original' cooling of the flowing water takes place because the medium can be accelerated without being retarded by the direct action of wall- pressures. In this case, therefore, th e resistance to motion that normally increases by the square of the increase in velocity - the reactive effect of all centrifugal pressure - cannot develop. Specially constructed blade-systems are here involved, which swirl the draining water-masses about their own cen tre of rotation. Under these con- ditions neither positive, nor negative temperatures can arise. Therefore the water accelerated in this way approaches the anomaly point of +4°C (+39.2°F). It is thus temperatureless and feverless, i.e. it becomes healthy and capable of reproduction and further development. This form of water movement is theref ore the one ur-gener ated by the blood of the Earth, the liquid that pressure-t urbines decompose. This explains why water becomes increasingly scarce where pressure-turbines are operating. Not only do they trigger an x-ray-like emission of radiation (inner heat and light), which destroys the structure and quality of the most vital cell-tissue, but in addition they rob the draining old-water of any ability to reproduce and fur- ther develop = to increase and ennoble itself, due to the decomposition of its"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Some Philosophical Aspects of Natural Energies 33 vital subtle-matter concentrates. This is the reason for the deterioration and dying out of water, without which ther e would be no growth, no life and no restoration of living standards on this Earth, for diseased water = inferior quality life. In regard to the systems of motion outlined briefly above, this results when, via the indirect route of the structure enlargement and character deterioration mentioned earlier, the seed of decay is ur-fertilised in the ur-cell of life by the irradiating cadaverine poison, which arises from the allotropic fat- concentrates exposed to pressure-inten sifying forms of water movement. Precisely the opposite is achieved when water and its vital constituents are accelerated in a suction-intensifying and invigorating type of turbine con- structed with special alloys, which densities the water mechanically and physically, therefore 'specifically'. In ot her words, a concentrative, structure- reducing, and character-improving synthesising current evolves, which radiates in all directions and also ur-fertilises the substance that the emissions from pressure-turbines decomposes. The outbirth of this ur-fertilisation is the physically first-born. It is the geospherically negatively supe rcharged amniotic fluid of the Earth in which, as is the case with all physical forms of procreation, the co-originating spirit is bound, which is also ur-created through the above higher-grade processes of motion and excitation. In the opposite case the most dangerous dynagen concentrate results, which only recently , free of any constraint, is being generated with the aid of an ingenious ly designed centrifuge - the cyclotron - for the supposed purposes of national defence. Produced in suction-turbines, the negatively potentiated ur-product of the cycloidally-moving Earth is therefore the 'original' resurrected entity, which in accordance with Nature's laws must be braked by a corpuscular carrier- substance. Unless this happens it will accelerate out of control and drag everything along with it. (viz. the cataclysm of Atlantis in which the supposed Deluge was triggered by the precipitating out of ur-water at great heights - a process that can be copied experimentally.) For this reason the suction-turbine must also be braked by heavy operating loads, otherwise it would also over-accelerate and levitate. In this case, in lieu of the familiar resistances to motion, additional rotation and levitational forces evolve through the upsurging bio-ma gnetic rotary synthesising current. In both cases we are ther efore concerned with suppl ementary ur-forces having opposite functions, which inaugurate eith er a progressive economic decline or the opposite.

This fish, which is known to remain motionless in torrential flows, flees upstream like lightning when danger threatens and in the spawning season floats upwards in the centre of the falling water-masses, which gyrate in cycloid-spiral-space-curves. Possessed of the requisite aids to enhance the potential of the 'original' dynagens, the trout cannot only overcome its own weight, but also the specifically heavy water-masses flowing against it. In conclusion it is necessary to address in more detail the question: Whence do these gigantic levitational forces actua lly come? Taking a very large-scale example from Nature, these are the forces that maintain the whole Earth in a fragile state of equilibrium, because th ey also move in cycloid-spiral-space- curves like every falling filament of water. The raw material for these atomic developmental products are the earthly remains of former life. Above all, it is the concentrates of fatty-matter which, regardless of any external positive te mperature influences, solidify after death. These are subjected to fermentation processes similar to those taking place in the stocks of fatty-matter in plant juices from which, depending on the type of motion and excitation, various acids evolve that give further rise to essential and energetic concentrates. This only happens if no vessels are used, wherein annihilating fire robs these concentrates of their allotropic (polymorphic) trace-elements, namely their concentrates of essential oils, which in such high-grade fermentation processes act like yeasts. It thus follows that all today's technical, hydraulic and chemo-dynamic machines, conveyances, agricultural implements (ploughs, harrows, disc- tillers, cultivators), dynamos, turbines, propellers, pumps, etc. are develop- mentally harmful, for apart from their pressure-intensifying shape, they are almost entirely constructed with materials unsuited to Nature's processes. Their use triggers off lower-grade vibrations in molecular structures. To the catalogue of bio-logical, therefore reactivated, errors in motion and excitation committed by modern nature-a lienated science, which has inaugur- ated the 'other' reaction and which is responsible for the decay and death of everything in existence, the following are to be included: • The supposedly advantageous 'light-induced' growth in monocultivated plantation forest, which is none other than the incipient proliferation of cancer, triggered by the influences of excessive light and heat inaugurated by modern forestry science; 19 • The pressure-intensifying cascading of contemporary systems of torrent confinement; • The loss of tractive force and carry ing capacity, and the associated problem of sediment, which has become insoluble; 19 See references in The Fertile Earth, Vo l. III of the Ecotechnology series. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Some Philosophical Aspects of Natural Energies 35 • The silting up and dislocation of the heavy water-masses, which must breach their banks, because the forma tion and build-up of the refluent (upstream flowing) bio-magnetic produc ts of noble matter that ur-fertilise the water, have been arrested thro ugh elimination of the form of motion that produces it. This is how the hither to inexplicable steadiness in drain- ing water-masses down a variable gradient was lost. 20 In this fashion all growth was also inte rrupted due to the shape and material of unnaturally constructed and alloyed ploughs, etc., which resulted in the trig- gering of reversed reactions in the pressure-sensitive, negatively potentiated and therefore cool fertile nutrient substratum. Particularly serious mistakes were made through the spreading of blast- furnace slag (so-called artificial fertilisers), whose intensified combustion once again robs the soil of its essential en ergy concentrates, the congealed oily sweetness, which the de-energised and fi nely pulverised slag then drags to itself from the surrounding negatively potentiated groundwater. Artificial fertilisers therefore remove the blood of the Earth's formative substances, which it must supply to the plants indirectly for the purposes of further enno- blement. In this way too, those lev itational factors were eliminated which triable the specifically heavy groundwater to maintain its precarious sus- pension on steep slopes. From this it can be seen how dangerous are the influences of fire and the lower-grade, expansively and expl osively function- ing temperatures that arise from fire-affected masses. This vaporising heat-form, which gradua lly leads to the desiccation of the soil, is the best prerequisite for the development of parasitic bacteria, whose appearance should be taken as a warning sign that serious errors in motion and excitation have been made. If these e rrors can be rectified, then the para- sites disappear automatically, because in a cool (fresh) soil, only apathogenic (health-enhancing) bacteria can survive. It is therefore ridiculous, for exampl e, to try to treat polluted water with chlorine, or to eliminate all noxious life-forms with poisonous gases, which would otherwise disappear automati cally by changing the motive and stimulative influences. In the opposite case, the evil will on ly be reinforced, for through the influence of the above poisons even what is still healthy will become diseased. Assuming that from what has been stat ed the two principal causes of the progressive economic decline and its political repercussions are now clear, all thatt now remains to be done is to dem onstrate the origins and causes of this decline in quality to the competent authorities. In more specific terms, this unwelcome state of affairs involves the dis- turbance of the interchange of substances at a molecular level. In other words, 20 See references in The Water Wizard, Vol. I of the Ecotechnology series. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"36 The Energy Evolution the alteration of the above fermentation process at its most fundamental phase. To make this even clearer: Allo tropic oxygen conformations are liber- ated through pressure- and heat-intensifying dynamic effects or volume- enlarging thermal influences, because the fat-concentrates with opposite polarity become inactive and are mainta ined in a passive state under such influences. This results in the inner fi ssion (dissociation) of the previously internally interconnected and highly evolved, therefore extremely pressure- and heat-sensitive trace-elements, wh ich like yeasts initiate the process of raw-material transformation - the fermentation process described above. It thus becomes comprehensible that all motion gives rise to inner molecular excitation, and conversely, that strong excitation causes a reversal in the molecular vibrations (the inner form of motion). This explains why, for example, the hitherto incurable can suddenly be healed and the hitherto h ealthy can become incurably ill (e.g. suffer a stroke). It also explains the hitherto inexplicab le effect of the water long known to the ancients as healing, or more correctly all-healing water, which 'specifically' densifies to the highest degree. Such water carries within it the relatively highest-grade products of synthesis derived from the above higher-grade dissociation and therefore is able to reprogramme the molecular fermentation process and thus specifically to heal the condition of disease caused by the opposite primary metabolic processes. In the management of today's forestry, agriculture, water and energy resources, lower-grade interactions between basic substances are triggered exclusively and without exception. That is to say, molecular disturbances are caused through the influences of fire and expansively acting temperatures. These disturbances immediately intens ify into chain reactions, thereby weakening the interaction between basic substances in the whole organism or actually reverse it. Thus, in accordance with Nature's inner laws, the dis- ruptions to development will become a ll the more severe, the more modern science, which produces the reversed motive and stimulative influences, achieves its phoney successes. In lieu of the 'original' pressure-less and heat- less motion of the Earth's masses, it h as invented and applied the reversed methods of motion and excitation. Those who understand what has been wr itten here will have to agree that we will inevitably become the hopeless and hapless victims of the scourge of the technical machine age, if we do not eliminate the errors in motion and excitation made thus far as quickly as possible, which ur-produce cadaverine poison in ray-form the 'specific' means of decomposition, as the end-product."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"2.

A Brief Description of My Discovery Leonstein, 1945 (Sch auberger Archives). rising from an exhaustive and in-depth observation of Nature, my discovery consists in the fact that all life and growth is shaped and fashioned through vibration and movement. This naturalesque form of motion I finally discovered after decades of research and countless series of experiments. It is the creative curving form of motion found in Nature that I have come to describe as 'cycloid-space-curve-motion', which in more common language is perhaps more easily understandable as a 'life-curve', 'curve of Nature' or even as a 'bio-curve'. Furthermore, I have also devoted considerable time and effort to translating these forms of motion and dynamic shap es, faithfully copied from Nature, into terms of mechanics. In this I suc ceeded and it provided me with the basis for my bio-technology. Through the naturalesque movement of liquid or gaseous substances (e.g. water and air) the following arise in Nature as well as in my apparatuses (which are neither difficult nor expensive to mass-produce): (a) Two different forms of temperat ure, which I shall refer to as T 1 and T 2 . Conditioned by these temperatures and al so closely associated with them, there also arise: A"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38 The Energy Evolution (b) Two different types of flow, which we shall describe as F 1 and F 2 . Through these hitherto unknown forms of temperature and motion the sub- stance in question (i.e. water or air) is decomposed, transformed and built up. In this way, through appropriate re gulation, elemental energies are freed. Suctional and pressural forces come into being, which in my apparatuses evolve along a common developmental axis and represent an entirely new means of motion and propulsion. To contemporary technology, physics and chemistry the following are so far unknown: 1. The form of motion used by Nature he rself (i.e. the cycloid-space-curve as the creative form-originating motion); 2. The temperature-form T 2 ; 3. The flow-forms F 1 and F 2 and the phenomena of elemental transformation resulting from them. In Nature the purpose of temperature-form T 1 , which is associated with flow-form F 1 , is to transform the condensed (allotropic) inner elements of organisms into aethero-energetic 1 animating and kinetic energies. These T 1 temperature-forms gives rise to falling and concentrating heat and exhibits rising and expanding cold effects. T 2 triggers reduction processes and fosters apathogens. If T 1 predominates, then an incr ease in raw materials and the qualitative improvement of all products of growth result. Temperature-form T 2 , which is related to flow-form F 2 , is generally known to contemporary technology, physics and chemistry. Its purpose in Nature is to precipitate out what has been decomposed, but not decayed, through F 2 flow-forms, or what is unsuitable for the purposes of the next higher form of development. T 2 temperature-forms exhibit rising a nd expanding forms of heat and falling (decadent) and condensing (con centrating) forms of cold. T 2 furthers bacterial life. If T 2 temperatures predominate, then a reduction in raw materials coupled with a simultaneous thriving parasitic activity results, the effect of which again reinforces the removal for reprocessing of everything unsuitable for higher purposes.

Excerpt from Bio-Technology: Active & Reactive Temperatures Leonstein, Easter 1946, Schauberger Archives. Decades-long observations of Nature, innum erable trials and series of experi- ments led to the discovery that two fundamentally different temperature- groups exist in Nature, namely: (A) a group with life-creating functions, and (B) a group with life-destroying functions. All forms of heat that initiate rising and expanding effects, and all forms of cold which inaugurate falling and concen trating effects belong to group B and are therefore development-impeding (growth-destroying). All forms of heat that give rise to falling and concentrating effects and all forms of cold that exhibit rising and expanding functions belong to group A and  are  thus  development-promoting.  Both expressions of temperament - and all forms of temperature can be viewed as such - serve for the build-up of tension, charge and potential. On the one hand these give rise to life-a ffirming dynagen-currents, which come into being when naturalesquely ferm ented fatty-matter, which the chemist calls 'carbons' (sweet matter), consumes (binds) the oxygenes 3 in an allotropic (condensed) state. On the other hand, life-negating dynagen currents form if the oxygenic elements, which become free, unipolar and aggressive under the influence of usual forms of heat (B-group temperatures), consume (bind) the sweet-matter concentrates. Under such influence the latter become passive and increasingly dense as they inwardly contract. In solid, liquid and gaseous inorganic bodies these life-negating currents act in the same way as poisons do in living organisms, and provoke processes of decomposition, decay or com- bustion; in a word, they destroy everything ripe for development. In the form of a formative and upwardly impelling dynagen flow, the digest- ive product of the former metabolic process has development-furthering (growth-promoting) effects. 3 Oxygenes: In similar fashion to the previous expl anation and interpretation of 'carbones', this relates to all n ormal forms of oxygen as well as to its more meta physical provenances. — Ed"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"40 The Energy Evolution In Nature both temperature groups are active. Group A provides for the progressive build-up of what is suitable for higher development. Group B is responsible for the precipitating ou t, breaking down and disassembly of everything unfit for such purposes. This has to be removed and as a life-form must be annihilated, or expressed more correctly, reduced to the relatively lowest developmental state, prior to attempting a renewed ascent under entirely different influences. This temperature group also becomes active when any given life-form has fulfilled th e purpose of its existence, its duty to multiply itself physically or further develop itself. Withering away through decrepitude, and as an over-ripe product of raw material, it is then made available for the build-up of qualigen with the aid of A-group temperatures. However, if for any reason B-group temperatures become active in the deceased substance, it will be putrefied, combusted or otherwise destroyed. Temperature group A is entirely unknown in scientific circles today and is also missing in our conceptual and linguistic vocabulary. All that is known therefore are the so-called processes of ox idation, combustion or decomposition; the so-called reduction process being unde rstood only in part. And this only to the extent to which it is responsible for the separation of both stocks of primary substances, namely the disso ciation of the allotropic carbones and oxygenes present in deceased organic or inorganic structures. All analyses of whatever kind are fo llowed by a synthesising process, i.e. the manifestation of what has been evol ved to a higher level. This is initiated by A-group temperatures out of which the formative, reproductive, upwardly evolving and qualitatively improving synthesising current arises. Either this important, or more corr ectly, vitally important process and the products of development arising fro m it are wholly unknown, or the possibility has been suppressed, which, with the aid of that which 'radiates' formatively, would enable the enlight ening life-flame to be supplied with qualigen. Here we are concerned with the end-product of a life-affirming (reactive) metabolic process, the most hi ghly evolved fatty-matter already in a metaphysical state, without which no increase in intellectual activity (ability) of any kind would be possible. In other words, either it is believed in such circles that progress as an indi- vidual ceases with the cessation of vital physi cal functions, or there is a definite interest in ensuring that, by inhibiting the production of qualigen by deliber- ately eliminating A-group temperatures, the dull-brained can never die out. The fact of the matter is that all fo rms of heat applied and exploited by science today, however and wherever they occur, engender rising and expanding effects. Similarly, all the fo rms of cold it utilises have falling and concentrating (mortally solidifying) f unctions, which lead to degrading, life-destroying expressions of temper ament. These wise Nature employs to eliminate everything unfit for further development as well as for purposes of"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"New Forms of Temperature 41 decomposition, for evacuation of excrement, or for initiating combustion processes that almost completely annihilate almost everything. This means, no more and no less, that retrogressive development will occur everywhere the influence of science is activ e. Therefore, for lack of the supply of qualigen, mental abilities will constantly deteriorate in step with the progressive rise in the quantity of living flesh. People will become imbecilic, vegetative and the lower orders of life will atrophy and little by little will cease to exist, because the relatively high est energy-concentrate, the 'upwardly radiating', is missing, which manifests and declares itself as 'Life'. Apart from this, it is an indisputable and demonstrable fact that B-group temperatures are about 96% more expe nsive to produce than the reactive A- group temperatures responsible for form ation and uplift, for which natural development-facilitating devices and associated systems of motion are required. The necessity to work will th erefore become progressively less, and food and other necessities will increase quantitatively and qualitatively as formative and levitative power strengthens. The same applies to all natural means of producing light and power (viz. the natural increase in the Sun's heat, when the distance from the Sun increases in summer and the developmental path of its energies elongates, or according to the findings of Pickard's research, it gets all the colder and darker, the closer this supposedly fiery orb is approached.) When the Earth approaches the Sun in wi nter the intensity of light increases, because in this case the resisting power of the Earth's almost hermetically sealed pores (nozzles) becomes greater. If this natural reciprocity is copied naturalesquely, then the production of power, light, heat and cold will be virtually free. On the other hand, germ inating- and growth-energies will con- tinuously and progressively rise to about an average of 30% per annum, which roughly corresponds to the normal increase in the human population. The devices for practically implementing the generation of the bio-magnetic formative and levitative current with th e aid of reactive temperatures (natural- esque expressions of temperament) have now been invented and in principle can be mass-produced. The Life-Current in Air & Water Leonstein, May 1946, (Schauberger Archives). \"Equivalence signifies uniformity and thus immobility.\" Viktor Schauberger, Implosion Magazine, No. 113, p. 23. It is a well-known fact that what we call the temperature of a body is the result of the motion of its molecules. According to the speed of such motion,"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"42 The Energy Evolution higher or lower temperatures are produced. As the motion slows, the temperature drops until ultimately, w ith the cessation of all molecular motion, absolute zero is reached at -273.15°C (-459.67°F). Cold is therefore just as much the result of motion as is heat, and de facto is merely a lower level of heat. So much for the scientific point of view. Entirely unknown to contemporary science, however, is that apart from this familiar form of temperature, there are also 'higher' forms of heat and cold, which are equally attributable to molecular motion. These 'higher' temperature-forms are to be differentiate d from those referred to at the begin- ning in that the 'usual' forms of heat have a rising and expanding function and their associated cold-forms have a falling and concentrating function. The 'higher' heat-forms are characterised by the fact that they possess falling and concentrating functions , and their associated cold, or refreshing forms have rising and expanding properties. So much for the general appreciation of this bio-technical finding, which is essentially founded on 'higher' physics, or biophysics. This 'higher' practically implementable metaphysics has nothing in common with today's science. We are therefore here concerned with real 'knowledge' and in no way with the commonly held concept of 'science'. The formulation of all terminology c oncerning this 'higher' knowledge is uncommonly difficult for the simple reason that today's science has com- mandeered all the relevant terminology, and thus in the German vocabulary there is a lack of suitable words with which to formulate these new concepts in a meaningful way. 4 For this reason the only way to approach things is by way of circumlocution so that they can be half-way understood by scientists. A true understanding is only possible after appropriate observable demon- strations, whereupon all the rigid theorems, principles and dogmas of today will then be rendered untenable a nd quickly collapse upon themselves. Moreover, all present laws, regardless of whether they concern the laws of energy conservation, gravitation or so -called heat-equivalence, will likewise be invalidated. To make it quite clear at the outset, what is here involved is something entirely new, which is why any proper assessment by scientists would be impossible. For this reason the Austrian government was requested to dispense with the expert opinion of specialists. All that is required is practical proof for which certain prerequisites are necessary, such as the one requested in the memorandum of the 15th of March 1946. 5 Uncanny experiences in a high alpine reserve almost untouched by human hand and a perhaps extraordinary gift for observation of Nature led to the discovery that a mysterious current lies hidden in the media of air 4 This also applies to the English language. — Ed. 5 This relates to the provision of premises for re search and development mentioned later in this article. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"New Forms of Temperature 43 and water, which is freed when these aqueous or gaseous bodies are moved naturalesquely. In every respect, experiments with this formative and levitative (synthesis- ing) current produced surprising results. Thus, for example, 2,000,000 volts per drop of water, which were measurabl e, visible and palpable, and there- fore incontrovertible, could be freed with appropriate charge-releasing devices. With 50 pairs of needle-jets about 200 million volts can be produced for virtually nothing, for which today' s science requires giant machines. Even then it can only produce an exceptiona lly disintegrative (analysing) current, which has life-negating properties. Th is is to be differentiated from the formative and levitative, therefore life-a ffirming, functions of the synthesizing current mentioned elsewhere. A few examples of applications should explain in general terms the nature of this novelty, still wholly unknown to contemporary science. If this current is conducted into vacuum tubes, then they emit a strongly pulsating blood-red glow horizontally along the elongated transverse axis and a dazzling, motionless, colourless and temperatureless radiance vertically up the elongated longitudinal axis, which fills the whole space. If the horizontally emitted current is first accumulated in a Leyden jar and conducted thence into petrol, then a tongue of flame is produced and the higher the accumulated charge, the longer the flame. If this current is conducted through strongly insulated resistances, then cool, juvenile water, free of other i ngredients is produced, which exhibits an uncommonly high dissolving capacity and cohesive power. Conducted into a hinged lever, which hangs down, this current stands it upright. It also causes pendulums to gyrate in peculiar looping, twisting movements. If this current is introduced into ordi nary water, then the water becomes cool, dense and specifically heavy and its ion-count increases many thousand- fold. It such water is drunk, then every kind of pain ceases almost immediately. After prolonged consumption of such water both mental and sexual potency increases in a truly striking fashion. Even the impotent will regain their potency. Kidney stones, gallstones and accretions of similar nature are dissolved and expelled in the form of grains or mucous. Rheumatic pains disappear com- pletely after a few weeks. Venereal and malarial bacteria are eliminated and passed out of the body in bloodstained ur ine. In short, under the supervision of doctors, no affliction has yet been found which has been able to offer any resistance to this life-current. Even malignant cases of cancer improved quite remarkably. These experiments were di scontinued, because the secret state police intervened owing to rising indignation amongst the medical fraternity.

Haertel Wien, director of the State Water Resources department. This I declined, because it required my moving to America or Engla nd and I had no desire to leave my homeland. For the same reason I also d eclined an offer from the Russians. Other offers from France, Turkey and Italy were similarly rejected. If specifically heavy high-quality water is atomised and the resultant water- vapour is compressed by a descending piston with a simultaneous infusion of atmospheric oxygen, then this aqueous mixture of air is instantaneously transformed into increased and highly po tentiated stocks of new air. The expansive pressure produced in this wa y corresponds to the power of about 2,000 atmospheres per litre of water. If ordinary air is bio-centrifugated above the speed of sound in very specially contoured and suitably allo yed development-facilitating devices, for which an auxiliary mechanical force is required in the order of 0.08 kW per cubic metre of moved air, then the torque-producing current (synthesising current) mentioned above arises, which also accelerates the device that gen- erates it. This further accelerates the intake of air, which again intensifies the strength of the current, resulting in an even higher rate of rotation, which provokes yet a further increase in the torque-producing current, and so on. Ultimately a powerful and highly potent vacuum is created in front of the generating device, while at the same time the expansive pressure described above exerts a squeezing, wedging pressure along its teardrop-like body (see figs. 22 6 & 38). These suctional and pressural forces, which evolve along a common developmental axis in the form of a fully developed dynagen gradient can overcome any weight or form of anchorage. What is here involved are the colossal carrying and tractive forces that maintain the whole Earth in an unstable floating state and cause it to rotate in peculiar spiral space-curves (cycloid-sp ace-curve-motion). They are the same forces that maintain the delicate equilibrium of a trout in fast-flowing water and enable everything that crawls and flies on this dung-heap - Earth - to overcome their own physical weight. In opposition to this dualistic formativ e, levitative and life-affirming force, however, there is a counterforce, which comes into being in a similar manner. It is also a biotechnically producable current, but functions in a life-negating way and can thus be described as the 'd eath-current', since, with the exception of developmentally harmful bacterial life -forms, it slowly but surely destroys all life. It breaks down and decomposes every organism so that under very specific pre-conditions and with the ai d of a very peculiar movement it can ur-generate new life or death forces of increased and intensified power from the product. 6 In regard to fig. 22, while the diagrams depict a submarine, theoretically the same process should also apply to a similarl y shaped aircraft. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"New Forms of Temperature 45 Practically and factually we are thus presented with the unveiling of the seven enshrouding veils of Sais 7 . We stand before the secret of the genesis of all life and its unfoldment, which viewed objectively is none other than the perfection of all that is raw material. It is the eternal process of self-renewal out of which are born the forces of growth and formation, as well as those of renewed decomposition and reversion, which appear in the form of synthesising or analysing currents, depending on whether the medium of air or water is moved naturalesquely in specially constructed and alloyed development-facilitating devices, or unnaturally in unsuitable ones. As absolute opposites these two forces, which promote either progressive or regressive development, arise from different sources; the destructive forces evolving from the temperature-forms that today's science exploits to operate its various types of machine. The form ative and levitative forces on the other hand stem from the 'higher' temperature-forms which, as stated earlier, are unknown to contemporary science. Conventional science has so far only become acquainted with the forms of heat that exhibit fatiguing effect s, which however are those heat- forms through which the resistance to motion increases by the square of the velocity. This occurs for the simple re ason that they are precisely the forms of temperature that kill off all dynamism and vitality and which, after a suitable development, are transformed into th e condensing (falling and concentrat- i n g ) cold-forms in order to conduct the thing in question back onto or into the Earth, where under the exclusion of light and heat it is prepared for a renewed attempt to rise. The actual source of life - the 'higher' temperature-forms from which the life-affirming, formative and uplifting levitation-current evolves, is an absolute novelty to today's science. Whether such a science consciously or unconsciously exploited precisely the opposite means to achieve a desired build-up of culture - the build-up 7 To give a greater understanding of events at Sai's, that ancient Egyptian city in the Nile delta, The Secret Doctrine by H P Blavatsky relates: \"...And how little Herodotus could tell is confessed by himself when speaking of a mysterious tomb of an Initiate at Sai's, in the sacr ed precinct of Minerva. There, he says 'behind the chapel is the tomb of One, whose name I consider it impious to divulge... In the en- closure there are large obelisks and there is a lake near, surrounded with a stone wall in a circle. In this lake they perform, by night, that person's adventures, which they call mysteries. It is well to know that no secret was so well-preserved and so sacred with the ancients as th at of their cycles and computations. From the Egyptians do wn to the Jews it was held as the highest sin to divulge anything pertaining to the correct measure of time.

The fact of the matter, however, is that through these totally perverse procedures and all manner of unnatural activities, everything we are experi- encing today that is difficult, disgraceful and degrading of human dignity had inevitably to happen. Deductively th inking logicians have therefore over- looked the causes of the supposed eff ects, out of which, depending on whether the form of motion is natural or unnatural, the respective ancillary forces that either affirm life or negate it come into being. In this regard the life-denying forces increase, reproduce and advance themselves in exactly the same way as their counterparts, which promote the naturally ordained course of further development th rough increase and qualitative improve- ment. This would be impossible, howev er, were it not for the temperature- forms responsible for expelling what is inferior and for purging, purifying and detoxifying organisms. It is out of these temperature-forms that the decomposing, analysing cavitation current arises, which today's science uses in the widest variety of ways and without exception for a supposed build-up of culture. Clearly the misfortunes we sha ll have to reap will be all the greater, the more widespread and intensive the ac tivity of a science that makes use of these lower-grade temperature-forms. The first person, who had unconsciously to grapple with this disastrous development, was Galilei, whose disc overy that the Earth itself moved, caused an immense uproar in secular and religious scientific circles. Galilei was forced to recant, although he recan ted his recantation shortly before his death. This he did at a moment when he could no longer be harmed by those, who like past dictators used similar means to torture those whose opinion differed from theirs, believing they coul d re-instil faith through the agonies of torture. His opponents, however, who were just as dangerous as they were ruthless, had practically no alterna tive but to acknowledge this new fact. Curiously enough, since then apparently no scientifically trained individual has bothered about the causes of the mysterious motion of this dung-heap Earth, and the purpose of its exceptional form of motion. This disinterest, however, was only feigned. In reality, since Galilei's discovery, people were very much on their guard in order to avert the immeasurable repercussions resulting from the revelation of: 'Why' does the Earth ceaselessly rotate about her own peculiar system of axes in an unstable state of equilibrium in so- called free space in very particular loopi ng movements in defiance of the laws of gravity?

It is the latter forces that are at issue here. Today's science, which measures and weighs everything exactly, overlooked them, because the 'producer of measure and weight' can neither be measured with a yardstick, nor weighed with decimal scales. In a word, after decades-long observations , trials and series of experiments, I succeeded in getting to the bottom of this mysterious double-game of Nature's and in becoming aware of th e unspeakable ferocity and purest mother-love that are united behind her two eternally concealed faces. I came to recognise the scales of fate of all life upon which every action is scrupu- lously weighed after death and that whatever is no longer fit for the next higher evolutive progression is once more ruthlessly eliminated, it being of too inferior a quality for its metaphysical transformation into exalted entities in the form of the above formative a nd levitative current. It has to return to greater or lesser depths within the Earth to interact with those vibratory influences in such a way that out of these basic substances new formative and levitative energies evolve for a renewed attempt to rise. It is these revitalised substances, whose higher forms of cooling essences possess expanding and upwardly impelling functions , which make this resurrection possible. Falling and concentrating light- and heat-forms then subsequently ensure the inter- mediate solidification of 'what is destined to vegetate', namely the actual physical form of growth in which the counter-energies also reside, which initiate the further interactions that enable this in termediate assembly of raw materials to grow, to reproduce and further evolve itself. Now comes a brief description of Nature 's principal formative substance - metaphysical fatty-matter 8 - about which a thick book could be written. As a reactive or 'higher' temperature-form this comes into being with the aid of the Earth's 'cycloid-space-curve-motion' unde r the exclusion of light and ordinary heat in the cool germinating zone, the boundary zone between the negatively potentiated geo-atmosphere and the pos itively potentiated external atmos- phere. This then develops as a potentia l that propagates horizontally in a wavi-linear movement. 8 Fatty matter. In its association with what Viktor Schauberger calls 'sweet matter', a creative, forma- tive substance, this relates to compounds prin cipally containing carbon C and hydrogen H (carbohy- drates - CH) and all the elements under the collec tive term 'carbone' or 'mother-substances'. In this regard, despite its general 'neutrality' as a carri er substance (like a woma n with child), H is more inclined to the feminine than the masculine. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"48 The Energy Evolution The raw materials out of which this fine matter arises under very specific preconditions, consist of the naturales quely interred earthly remnants of former life. On no account are they senselessly and purposelessly reduced to dust and ashes, but once again, under particular preconditions, they develop into the 'peculiar' axis in the form of the formative and levitative current mentioned earlier. This spiritualisi ng and uplifting current, which inwinds, upwardly impels and whirls around like a tornado, is partially condensed by the above heat-forms and can be read ily measured and generated in any quantity and quality almost without cost. By means of this formative and levi- tative current all growth can be increased and qualitatively improved almost at will, and any weight can be lifted or moved indirectly at any desired speed rotationally and / or ver tically with a power that increases by the square. The source of this formative and levitativ e marvel is the 'higher' temperature- form that evolves through the previously described form of motion, which is produced in very specially contoure d and alloyed development-facilitating ur-forms (extreme egg-shapes). Naturally, this ur-powerfully-active prin cipal formative substance is barely perceptible in water or air, because th e naturalesque motion of the Earth has already transmuted it into a metaphysically potentiated state, where in a semi-free and semi-bound condition it characterises the 'goodness' and 'intrin- sic quality' of the aqueous or gaseous medium. Therefore if the media of water or air are moved naturalesquely (and the trick is how to do this) then the bipolar gases are initially transformed into aetheric and ultimately into energetic stocks of subtle matter. These are then bound in the self-evolving juvenile medi a (air and water) and what has been increased in this way is rendered homogenous and specifically densified. That is to say, they intensify the carry ing capacity and tractive force to such a degree that in such waters material with a higher specific weight than the transporting medium, even ore with a specific weight of 1.9, readily floats down the centre of the axis, where the strongest suctional force acts down- stream and the strongest reactive force acts upstream in the form of a dynagen gradient, but which, however, has no effect on raw material structures to the extent that these do not involve life-forms. This also explains why the very mo ment that watercourses were hydrauli- cally 9 regulated, i.e. when the natural system of flow was ruined, the calamity concerning the transport of sediment began. 10 The riverbanks were attacked, the riverbed silted up and the water ejected itself from its dislocated course with elemental ur-force in order to rega in its naturalesque form of motion, through which that something is also propagated and deployed to which 9 Hydraulically: The use of the term here relate s specifically to conventional hydraulics, — Ed. 10 See Viktor Schauberger's writings on river engineeri ng in The Water Wizard, Vol. I of the Ecotechnology series. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"New Forms of Temperature 49 everything that lives on this manure-h eap owes its independent movement, the 'original form of motion', and its own power to reproduce and further develop itself. This naturalesque form of motion will now be once more reinstated in those places where there are inaccessible stands of precious timber, which are apparently untransportable with oxen, horse-teams, tractors, cable or forest railways, etc. and, as occurred at Neuberg in Steyrling, will be floated to its destination as circumstances demand with about a 90% saving in transport costs compared to the best transport sy stems presently available. Therefore at a time when, according to radio and press reports about 800 million people, i.e. about 1/3rd of the world's present population, are threatened with starvation, those people can be saved, whose only assets are those valuable timbers spared by modern forestry, becau se they were deemed irrecoverable, and who for this reason will be repa id in gold by nations with a high exchange rate, or in what is of far gr eater value today - food. For today what- ever still stands in accessible forests - as every timber expert knows - is worth nothing, or precious little. Such products of forestry science are in any case unsuitable for export. After this brief pointer as to how th ese gigantic formative and levitative forces can be made use of in the national economy, it should also be ntioned that these 'original' tractive and transportive forces can be applied to the silent, odourless, smokeless, toxic-emission-free propulsion of all types of machine, all forms of conveyance on land, on water and in the air at any desired speed and at negligible cost, fo r in such machines, instead of resist- ance, the power increases by the squa re of the velocity. Now devoid of foundations, the crowning law of fire-spitting technology will therefore collapse upon itself. It would take too long here to d escribe the necessary preconditions through which it is possible to build up the ener gy-sources (the 'higher' temperature- forms) out of which the formative and le vitative current - characterised in the title as the 'life-creating current' - comes into being. A small error in motion therefore suffices to provoke a general susceptibility to cancer in what has created everything we can see around us or are other- wise aware of. It is really not immaterial whether motion must first be active in the pro- duction of a temperature, which on its part triggers a reactive increase in motion, or whether a temperature induced by physical, thermal or chemical means affects physical movement by way of the molecular motion. The matter first becomes complex, however, when the di fferent temperature-forms mentioned earlier are included in the equation, wherein it is also necessary in regard to the types of motion, to differentiate betw een those that produce the 'higher' or 'lower' temperature-forms."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"50 The Energy Evolution The former invigorate, the latter enervate. The development of high-grade products of potentiation is only possible via an exceptionally long course of developmen t - and what is decisive here - only if the mechanical motive impulse takes pl ace first, which then automatically gives rise to the reactive increase in power upon which the normal course of further development is founded. However, as is the case with all today's machines, if the physical, thermal or chemical starting impulse happens first, then the opposite reactive course of further development results. It thus becomes clear that with an increasing rate of rotation the resistance to motion in creases by the square of the enforced acceleration in the interchange of substances (metabolism). The crowning law of today's technology is therefore no natural law, but the biological consequence of a tragic error of contemporary science. For if the naturalesque metabolic process is in itiated through equa lly naturalesque impulses (il primo movere), then as the velocity increases owing to the addi- tional input from the inwinding rotary current, the power increases by the square. The outcome of this developmental process is an almost cost-free, development-promoting mechanical pow er - the evolving water (viz. the atomised water vapour). In the opposite case, annihilating fire and its cohorts, including toxic gases, are created, which in association with the debilitating temperature-forms from which rigor mortis develops, foster the proliferation of bacteria. It thus follows that all attempts to combat the source of disease of whatever kind, are senseless and futile as long as the formative metabolic processes are not controlled causatively at their root -level. This also explains why pains disappear and the most serious diseases improve markedly when water is drunk in which formative and levita tive substances have been bound and which further evolve at the expense of the developmentally harmful elements in the organism that consumes such water. As a result the organism auto- matically regains its capacities, i.e. it becomes physically and mentally potent - and therefore healthy. Fundamentally, therefore, we are dealing with two metabolic processes entirely different in nature and function, both of which are necessary, for without any purging and purifying process no more highly evolved forms could be built up. These two metabolic processes, which in every organism interact recipro- cally, are: (a) the process of oxidation, and (b) the process of reduction, which, while known to today's chemist, are initiated unnaturally, therefore in the wrong way, and carried out with th e use of ordinary temperature-forms."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"New Forms of Temperature 51 The product of the oxidising process is an analysing current. The product of the reducing process is a synthesising current. In the first case a form of molecular mo tion is inaugurated, which results in the principal primary formative s ubstance being bound, consumed and digested by the countervailing stocks of oxygen. This process is caused by the liberati on of this dangerous retrogressive substance, which has become unipolar and aggressive through a pre-active physical, thermal or chemical starting impulse, whereas the principal formative substance, the naturalesquely fermented fatty-matter, or so-called carbon (carbone), becomes passive and inactive under this influence. However, if the mechanical starting impulse is activated first, which must be produced in appropriately cont oured development-facilitating devices, then higher cold-forms arise through which the fatty-matter (carbone or sweet matter), which reacts to centrifugence, 11 becomes free, unipolar and highly active. In this situation the ox ygen, which becomes passive under this influence, is consumed (bound), providing it has been dosed (dispersed) mechanically and made palatable (t hinned out), (viz. the swaying and fluttering branches of plants). Every developmental or re developmental process therefore has its character- istic source, which gives rise to one or the other activity (function). This involves two temperature groups: (A) the formative, life-affirming (incremental), and (B) the disintegrative, life-negating (decremental). To group A belong all falling and con centrating heat-forms and all cold- forms, which initiate rising and expanding phenomena. To group B belong all rising and e xpanding heat-forms and all cold-forms having falling and concentrating effects. This latter temperature-form is applied by today's science universally, and hence it strives in vain to achieve the build-up of any form of culture (i.e. a naturalesque course of further developm ent). On the contrary, it must reap economic reversals, which will become a ll the more palpable, the more wide- spread and intensive this activity becomes. In Nature both temperature groups are active in every healthy organism. This is necessary because the forma tive and uplifting levitational essences evolve from the higher temperature group A and the purging dissociative 11 This seems to conflict with statements made el sewhere, which attribute intensified carbone activity to centripetence (outside—>inward motion), a nd intensified oxygen activity to centrifugence (inside->outward motion). In actu al fact for each of the two subs tances there are two opposite 'reac- tions' involving centripetence and centrifugence. Oxygen 'reacts' to centrifugence by becoming aggressive and 'reacts' to centripetence by beco ming passive. Conversely carbone 'reacts' to centrifu- gence by becoming passive and 'reacts' to centripeten ce by becoming highly active, as is also affirmed on the following page. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"52 The Energy Evolution forces from the lower temperature group B, which enforce the gravitation of all that cannot be uplifted. This duality therefore involves a rhythm within a rhythm - a sort of four-stroke motor, in which upward, downward, inward and outward impulses can rhythmically take place on a common develop- mental axis. A perpetual state of turmoil is constantly created in an epicentre of commotion, leading to continuous fi ssion and fusion (separation and com- bination), whereby what matters is which metabolic process predominates. In other words, in this primordial battle between the ur-feminine and the ur- masculine, whether the re-destructive or the re-creative is victorious. The one that triumphs is the one that is able to drag its opponent into the middle of this gigantic wrestling match, there to encircle, bind, consume and digest it. The very specific molecular motion mentioned in the opening paragraph is what is decisive here. More particul arly, a mechanically induced outside- inwardly directed impulsive force is required, through which, aided by supplementary influences, Nature's principal formative substance - naturalesquely fermented, etherised fatty-matter (carbones or sweet-matter) - becomes free unipolar and highly active a nd is able to overpower its opponent, which becomes passive under these influences. Here we are concerned above all with a conformity with a natural inner law of reciprocity today entirely unknown to science. That is to say, with very particular types of motion in specially formed and alloyed development- facilitating devices, the preconditions d escribed in the preceding paragraph are satisfied, and because of this the 'Ete rnally Feminine', as Goethe called this creative essence, can press its counterpart (oxygen) into the centrepoint of this battle and conquer it (see fig. 10).

Springing forth from 'higher' temperatures, it rationally and truthfully explains the in crease of what is corpuscular and its qualitative improvement - in a word, the transmutation and perfection of all that is raw material - the process of self-renewal, or to put it briefly, evolution and all growth, its coming into being and passing away. However, if a physical, thermal or chemical starting impulse is first active, which influences the molecular motion in such a way that the oxygen becomes free, unipolar and aggressive due to the resurgence of positive, group B temperatures, then having been forced into the centre of this combat, the principal formative matter will become passive and will be bound, consumed and digested. The product of this event is the developmentally harmful cavitation current - a variety of the so-called electric current - which as an exceptionally analysing current not only pits and corrodes steel turbine blades, but also decomposes and dissoci ates the blood of the Earth - water. In short, it robs everything and anything of its remaining formative and levitative energies in order to mortify th e thing itself and to dispatch what has deviated from its ordained path back into this eternally fermenting manure heap - Earth. There, thanks to her sp ecial motion and other prerequisites, the total transformation of what has sunk down ensues. Blood formation or blood decomposition - synthesising or analysing current - vitalisation or devitalisation - health in mind and body or disease, death and economic disaster, all these ar e decreed by what in the opening paragraph science calls molecular motio n whilst having no knowledge of the differences in the forms of motion, which not only determine existence or non-existence, but also all economic progress or decline. There is insufficient space here to explain the nature of biomagnetic and bio- electric currents or their origin and purpo se in more detail. They always come into being and operate simultaneously, b ecause everything is bipolar, i.e. in every man the feminine also exists, a nd in every woman the masculine. Here too it is merely a question of which type of molecular motion took place first, thus giving precedence to processes of oxidation or reduction. All it takes therefore is a small starting impulse to de termine the fate of all living things and whether they are dispatched on a downward or upward path.

This may truly appear to be the m onstrous invention of an unsound mind to those who have no inkling what co lossal energies are contained in a tiny drop of water, which are either bound or freed according to the type of motion. It may also seem just as utopian wh en it is stated that with the aid of these elemental ur-forces secreted in the medium of water and in the air (or the condensed Breath of God), the entire production of power, heat, cold and light can be reduced in cost by slight ly more than 90% and that with this formative synthesising current all growth can be increased by about 30% per annum and qualitatively improved. Today's forest, land, water and energy resources management and all branches of contemporary science - what ever the specialist discipline - are tragic mistakes, whose terrible conse quences will only become apparent when the irrefutable truth has been grasped through practical demonstrations; when people see and understand what is created when any thing - above all air and water - is moved unnaturally and therefore wrongly. Through this absurd form of motion precisely that temperat ure-form is produced which gives rise to the developmentally harmful cavitation current that wise Nature uses to remove everything from the path of evolution, which for one reason or another is unfit for the growth and formati on of the relatively highest quality.

Through the discovery that the good old Earth rotated - now recognised throughout the world - Galilei experienced all manner of difficulties, a case that is far from isolated, because all those who sift through ancient traditions and practices also have to suffer the full measure of unpleasant experiences and consequently have every reason to repay them with interest and compound interest when the right moment comes. Unfortunately Galilei could not explain why the Earth actually rotates and what actually should be understood by the term its 'own' or more correctly its 'peculiar' axis. Had he also been able to pass on this information, then we would have been unlikely to have experienced this disastrous machine age Nor would we have had to experience the lunacy of trying to build up a culture with the influences of fire and the usual forms of heat, which in Nature are used to decompose what is unsuitable for further development And so it came to pass that the forests were senselessly sacrificed in order to produce the usual rising and expanding heat-forms, which propels flies to the ceiling in a mad rush, while freezing those on th e floor.

Reacting to bio-centrifugen ce, these basic substances are liberated through the cycloid-space-curve-motion of the Earth and under the influence of reactive cooling substances, consum e (bind) the counter-weighing oxygen. Reactive differences in potential are cr eated in this way which express them- selves as reactive differences in temperature, which on their part, as all- penetrating inner outward<->inward , upward<->downward dynamic influ- ences, intensify the physical (external) form of movement. This leads to a renewed intensification of the inner dynamic processes, which once again act to stimulate additional motion. Thus it is absolutely no wonder that the good old Earth eternally rotates about her peculiarly unique axis, because in this special axis (viz. the shimmering shaft in a water vortex) that something ascends, which enables stationary trout to stand motionless amidst torrential flows and to flee upstream like lightning. A phenomenon inexplicable in terms of mechanics, because the trout must not only overcome its own weight, but also that of the counter-fl owing dense and heavy spring water. Indeed it can escape upstream all the more rapidly, the faster the cold specifi- cally heavier water-masses, which swir l about their own axes in exactly the same way that the Earth rotates about he rs, enter its jaws and flow out of its gills through a system of cycloid-space-cu rves. In this way the particular axis is formed in which that something re turns to its ur-source, which becomes free through this special rotating motion and the frictional motion produced by it. In becoming free in this way, it then draws the motion-generating form - in this case the trout - in its wake, because this counter-flowing energy-form is the force that enables everything th at crawls and flies on this manure-heap Earth to overcome its own weight. In other words, it is the 'levitational force', without which there would be no life, no movement, no growth and naturally no gravitation either. With this natural formative and levitative force, which only evolves through cycloid-space-curve-motion, machines of all kinds, both stationary and mobile, and even projectiles, can be operated at almost no cost and propelled at any desired speed on land, in and under water, and in the air. This tremendous power arises from cold oxidative processes, which take place when stocks of bio-centrifugated carbonic acid - as was stated above - react to bio-centrifugence, a nd under the effects of certain other co-factors attain their relatively highest state of expansion (ray-form state). In this freed (liberated) state they consume (bind) the oxygenic elements, which - still unknown to science - react to centripetence.

The vertically disposed forces of cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes, etc. ar e also founded on this developmental process and owe their kinetic energy to cold processes of oxidation. 'Conventional' science and fire-spitting technology naturally do this very differently, indeed in a diametrically opposed fashion. They exploit hot processes of oxidation as the developmental basis for the build-up of a de- composive and retrogressive force, which in Nature is employed for the recall for reconstitution of what is unfit for development. No wonder therefore that this type of force reacts, with resist ances that increase by the square, against the insanity of its wrongful exploitation for the purposes of the build-up of culture. Therefore the crowning law of today's technology, the conservation of energy law and the so-called heat e quivalent are founded on an unnatural developmental basis. To put it plainly, contemporary science and its tech- nology have backed the wrong horse and ha ve ridden it for so long, or have sacrificed the available raw materials to power precisely the opposite force to such an extent as to drag in an econom ic collapse by its head and shoulders. It has not understood how to copy the ideal method of generating power and formative energy, or through the natura lesque transformation of inferior raw materials into quality products, how to make the natural sources of energy available in unlimited quantity for a vi rtually free, silent and development furthering mechanical power.

For this reas on it is still necessary to take a small example as an aid, which every resp ectable Tyrolean knows, who loves a good wine, even if a little dry. It is known that a good, light and palatable old wine comes into being through fermentation in a cellar. This is none other than a form of digestive process in which cycloid-space-curve-motion naturally plays a part - a motion the naturalistic doctor calls the ' life-creating spiral' and the biotechni- cian 'double spiral wave motion' (viz. the cycloid movement of the blood, to which we owe the build-up of mental essences, the creation of thoughts, the formation of our bones and flesh, reproductive embryos and of course, the possibility of overcoming our own physical weight). When the fruit juices that have flourish ed in the Sun begin to ferment, it is a sign that reactive temperature differences have triggered the fermenting movement, which in the initial stages h as to separate the inferior from the superior. The former will be separated and centrifugated out through cycloid- space-curve-motion. The latter interconnect s with itself, as it were, and the product of this remarkable marriage process is that something, which also brings us out of the delicately balanced equilibrium that the Earth ceaselessly enjoys. Not being in a state of stable e quilibrium, she has constantly to rotate about her own axis in a form of move ment that declinates and oscillates in two directions. This is how she gene rates the inversely symmetrically- and inversely proportionally-acting force, which enables everything that crawls and flies on this dung-heap Earth to move 'originally' (autonomously) in order to seek out its food, which also cont ains allotropic energy-producing sub- stances. These are then broken down through the vibration of the organs, leading to the familiar development of physical strength and mental vigour, whose ur-causes have not been perceive d by physico-technical scientists, who calculate with common calories and me asure them with decimal scales and rulers. Moreover, they also believe they have captured everything with their tweezers that is proper to Nature. Un fortunately, however, this cannot be accomplished with such an instrument, because the producer of 'measure' and 'weight' is an imperceptible extra-ordina ry energy-form, which as the 'essential' is the 'reactivated' itself, which actively moves the ordinary.

For this reason all the more regrowth must occur, the greater the production of form- ative and levitative forces through cycloid-space-curve-motion. Conversely, because of this increase in raw materials, increased stocks of quality matter will subsequently be produced through which the levitational forces will again be intensified.

We, poor souls, to whom only a single, unique life is available in which we will also be forced to make use of cy cloid-space-curve- motion in order to alleviate almost in tolerable reactive energies through their abreaction, will have to behave more sensibly in order to become somewhat more blissful while still on this Earth th an has been the case due to the efforts of 'active' technicians. In other words, we must reverse the way things are done. Cycloid-space-curve-motion must therefore be given pride of place, which logically leads to the almost co st-free mechanical generation of reactive differences in potential, which in turn give rise to increased and intensified active differences in motion. Harnessed on ce more, these trigger further high- grade differences in potential of a reactive nature, and so on and so forth until temperatures and reactive forces of such a kind are triggered that it is a veritable art to devise an operating lo ad heavy enough to brake and contro these elemental suctional and pressural forces. At the right time, therefore, we must keep our eyes open for the specialists and experts, who function as super-brakes on development!! Most cer tainly, however, we must replace those, who today brake the normal cour se of development with the reversed interplay of forces, which they do in such a way as to increase and intensify precisely those kinds of energy that promote decomposition and the expul- sion of what is unsuitable for further de velopment. In so doing they trigger a form of perpetual motion, because here too the self-intensifying decomposive and repulsive forces also increase by the square owing to the cycloid-space- curve-motion of the Earth. Sadly they do not see what they have themselves created, namely boundless decline and disintegration instead of an equally"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"New Forms of Motion and Energy 61 boundless self-intensifying formative build-up, which also results from the universally operating cycloid-space-curv e-motion. This would happen merely by reversing the process that they and physico-technical science teach in school and church alike. Consequently - and one can believe it or not - there are two marvellously functioning forms of perpetual motion that direct and produce the eternal coming into being and passing away. For a change, it would be worth setting the other in motion, in order - as already stated - to become somewhat more blissful while actually on Earth than we are under the direction of those who, apart from heating our living spaces unnaturally, also commit all manner of other blunders, for which the present state of affairs is proof. And thus on the next and final page everyone can seek out for themselves what best pleases or appeals to them. The Practical Application of Cycloid-Space-Curve- Motion arising from Processes of Cold Oxidation Forestry This would involve the propagation and build-up of fast-growing species of valuable timber by restoring cycloi d-space-curve-motion through the re- establishment of naturalesque proportions in the intermixture of various crown and root systems. This will resuscitate the reactive temperature-differences (the reinstatement of microclimates through the graduated arrangement of over- and understoreys and juxtapositio n of species) through which the heat- consuming upflows of refreshing and cooling substances ascend like cycloid whirlwinds, which trigger cold pro cesses of oxidation enabling the propagation of species of fine timber on the forest floor (formation of the germinating zone). Agriculture Here the concern would be for the propagation and build-up fast-growing high-quality fruits and cereals through the selection and correct distribution of principal crops and intercrops through the supply of allotropic fat- concentrations in a liquid, vaporous or even an energetic state - the supply of noble water by underground means or the direct supply of noble elements by means of Repulsators (see figs. 24-26)."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"62 The Energy Evolution Water Supply The application of this form of motion would bring about the revivification of sluggish, stale, tired, fish deficient, bacterially polluted brooks, streams and rivers through the artificial reinstatement of cycloid-space-curve-motion in draining water. 3 In other words, the reconfiguration of truncated and straight- ened channels in which the more exalted formative and transformative processes can no longer occur, due to the absence of cycloid motion. Therefore the stocks of basic allotropic heat-imparting substances are no longer consumed (bound) and the improperl y regulated watercourses inevitably become warm, stale, devoid of fish an d infected with bacteria, because the revivifying form of motion is missing or has been disrupted or eliminated by smooth-walled bank rectification. Energy Supply Here such motion can be practically applied to the following: (a) To the liquefaction of coal or carbonic-acid-bearing minerals by way of cold (cycloid) systems of flow, e.g. the generation of incombustible, gas- deficient and highly expansive, dyna gen-rich 'explosive' water and drive water with the aid of Repulsators for the purpose of producing highly expansive pressures for driving machines of all kinds. (b) To the etherisation of ordinary air-masses through the re-pulsive precipi- tation of inferior waste matter (water-like carrier substances) and the enhancement of im-plosive suctiona l forces through the generation of an 'organic vacuum', the co-active c ounterforce to the above high-pressure expansion, by means of Repulsines (see figs. 30-33). (c) the fabrication of naturalesquely desi gned water turbines, pumps, etc. (see figs. 11-13) with about a 90-fold increase in output and performance under otherwise equal conditions through the combination of both components of motion (pressural and suctional forces in a reactive state) on a common developmental axis. (d) To the heating and cooling of living spaces with the aid of allotropic mineral elements through the intensifi cation of the re-pulsive power and performance of expansive substances (t he radiation of stocks of basic elements from selenium cells.

Today's science is not only founded on a false developmental basis, but also on too low a level of knowledge. It ignores the formative reaction and using combustion processes gives pride of 4 Excremental or faecal technology: This expression refl ects Viktor Schauberger's view that today's tech- nology is founded on the wrongful combustion of wast e matter, such as oil and coal. As the energy- deficient physical residues of former ly vital substances, i.e. the expe lled by-products of interactions of a purely energetic nature, he regards them as Nature's faecal matter — hence the term 'excremental'."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"64 The Energy Evolution place to an economy powered by excremental matter.

Even in the present situ- ation it is not an easy matter not to say too much, nor too little. In a certain sense, a golden middle way must be sought in order to identify clearly those things that which will determine the fu ture fate of humanity. A way out will aso be shown to those who have suffe red serious setbacks from every quarter, leaving many a bitter after-taste behind. In many instances, these were remi- niscent of the religious inquisitions, when it was also believed that a person's faith could be fortified with all manne r of instruments of torture. Similar torment had to be endured by the peopl e, which will be just as little forgotten as the satyr-like excesses of those who, as former dictators, should be held responsible for the most heinous offe nces. For the German people these will foreshadow a lasting shame, although throughout the ages there were people, who did precisely such things whenever their retention of power was threat- ened - a sign that there was no other solution to keeping their heads above water  a  little  longer.  In every case, however, it was always those who suffered either from too great a trust or from a belief in salvation already bordering on insanity, and therefore incapable of judging for them selves, who had to pay the penalty. Thus they became the victims of those, who already knew how to manipulate history so cleverly, that in the end a ll that was left for the unsuspecting co- travellers on this road, was to be hung along with the guilty. And thus they were doubtlessly sympathetic towards the present English Labour Party, when it no longer felt obliged to support those elements of British foreign policy of the preceding decade, which in the House of Commons had been criticised by the rank and file of the Labour movement. So much briefly for politics per se in regard to the universal analysis of day-to-day political decision-making, which plays such a majo r role in these present times that it is just as difficult to obtain an overview and assessment of it, as it is the con- tents of pastoral letters, or the quite uncanny silence of those, who as perhaps the most successful businessmen, have the keenest interest in the present state of affairs, but who say absolutely nothing about it for the time being. For many centuries my forefathers served as foresters under the bishop's crook and being in this particular prof ession, experienced things an outsider could never even imagine. This is becau se the forester's whole approach to life predisposes him to expect the full measure of certain human weaknesses."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"66 The Energy Evolution The behaviour of the timber merchants was therefore not totally unfamiliar to him, who in this regard and in ot her ways too would think nothing of thoroughly taking the next good fellow for a ride whenever the opportunity presented itself. As a former Master of the Wilderness and hunting guide to a princely house, I myself have had a profound insi ght into the customs and practices of those circles, who consider it a matter of course to exploit their underlings as a means to an end, so as to be able to enjoy their lives and occasionally to afford themselves pleasures, which, were it conceivably possible, would even bring a blush to the face of a lecherous ol d buck well versed in such affairs. In any event, charity has never yet been the motivating sentiment of those, who coined this beautiful word or who made all manner of promises on this account, which were impossible to keep fro m the very outset for reasons that will be elaborated in greater detail in what follows. This should not be viewed as a cheap critique, however, but rather as a necessity in order to expose the root of the evil and thus place a finger on the actual wound. With very few exceptions, this will be experienced as painful or at least as unpleasant. Unless this is done, however, the concept of an 'economy founded on reactive energies' cannot be explained. Without 'reaction' there would be no growth and further development, no increase of any kind, and no qualitative improvement. Similarly there would be no refined matter, no raw material, no motion and no life. What triggers this reaction is the well-known dynamics of the sexual urge, which re-establishes equilibrium betwee n intolerable differences in tension and potential. Because these differences are always present, this original form of movement will constantly be provoke d by a motivating force that never wanes. As a form of motion, we are here primarily concerned with the motion that the Earth has demonstrated to us since the beginning of time. Referred to as 'cycloid-space-curve-motion', it is s ynonymous with what the naturalistic doctor calls the 'life-creating life-spiral ', and the biotechnologist calls 'double screw-form wave motion'. It is common knowledge that Galilei discovered this motion and because of it, suffered a veritable martyrdom. Up to now nobody has been able to explain why secular and religious science were so hugely disturbed by this discovery. Since then there has no long er been any doubt that the Earth rotates about its own axis. Why it does so, and what purpose is served by this peculiar inclined, gyrating motion, wh ich oscillates to and fro along two different axes has so far never been explained. 5 Every attempt to provide an explanation was thwarted due to the strenuous resistance of those, who had already made Galilei's life difficult. This awoke in me such a interest in the true na ture of this peculiar and unique motion, 5 See figs. 6a, 6b & 7, Nature as 'Ieacher, Vol. II of the Ecotechnology series. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"New Forms of Motion and Energy 67 that I made it my life's work to investigate it down to the smallest details. In spite of the victimisation and harassment, this intention was also carried through to the point where, as perhaps the only one who really knew, I had the right to expose with ruthless clar ity, the reasons why even today this explanation is still so opposed and no stone left unturned to suppress it. Since there would be little point in pr oviding a long and detailed preliminary scientific explanation, a simple exam ple that can be understood by everyone will suffice to explain the nature of this form of motion, which we all have to thank for all we see around us or are otherwise aware of. Only one thing remains hidden from us and that is the 'reactive' temperature-form. This actu- ally involves higher undetectable temp erature differences, which reveal the presence of two opposing 'ur-primordial' primary substances, which explain the profound mystery of the genesis of a ll life or inner motion. Since this will invalidate all forms of contemporary belief and science, it seems to be the real reason why an explanation is shunned in such circles. Whether this is intentional or unintentional will not and cannot be addressed here. One thing should be emph asised at the outset, namely, that it is futile to continue to oppose this explan ation, which is in the interest of all humanity, because widespread interest in this mysterious form of motion has already been so aroused that no power on Earth is in a position to frustrate it. But now to the example mentioned earlier: In the 'normal' course of cellar fermentation two different (reactive and active) temperature differences (this two-fold concept will be described later) tr igger off that special form of motion which, after the expulsion of the less valuable in two opposite directions, gives rise to ethereal energetic matrices that also operate in the same two directions. A destructive force that self-i ntensifies by the square is activated, whose function is to return to the Earth as quickly as possible, everything that would inflict damage on that which explains all life and movement, and which moves in the other direction (vertically) towards its objective. This self-generating force, which also intensifies by the square, not only refutes above all the conservation of energy law, the law of gravity and the Second Law of Thermodynamics; in short, all rigid laws of whatever kind, but also renders just as invalid, all those basic tenets and principles impossible in Nature, such as the dogmatic axioms of theology. By enshrining these so- called laws, both science and theology have committed several blunders, and through this identification of their intentionally or unintentionally pro- mulgated fallacies, have made fools of themselves for all time. In any event, they gained an advantage in this way, the loss of which will now for the first time reveal the unholy consequences of the greatest deception, although it could merely be self-deceit. For if the pr ocess is reversed, i.e. if the form of motion actuated by the above temperature differences is given first place in naturalesquely constructed and sh aped development-facilitating devices,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"68 The Energy Evolution then even higher forms of temperature influence evolve with which all that we so commonly call 'growth' can be regulat ed at will. In addition, we are pro- vided with waxing, self-generating mo tive forces, which intensify by the square, making mechanical power of every kind virtually free of cost and therefore worthless according to today's values. According to higher con- cepts, however, they become valuable fo r the first time, for in comparison the motive forces in use today are not only as good as worthless, but are also responsible for the fact that things are deteriorating all the more rapidly, the wider the scope of today's technology, or its intensification. This realisation is consistent with the fact that this excr emental technology, which exploits these perverted energies for propulsion, is virtually at an end, because oil is already in short supply and the stocks of wood and coal are quite unable to cover the demand. As things now stand, nobody knows what is to replace them. We shall now address what is encompassed by the title of this article. Rather than present a long and detailed descrip tion or explanation, the only proper course of action would simply be to de monstrate the new source of energy, as most people would suggest. Certainly that would be the right thing to do. However, various reasons argue against this, which should and must be taken into account. Firstly, in the present times [immediately post-WW II] it is not at all easy to obtain the necessary materials, suitable skilled labour, machines, etc., all of which are required to fabricate these bio-machines. Moreover, and under- standably so, a justifiable disbelief also prevails when such Utopian things are to be produced and also have to be e xplained in order to begin the laborious creation of a first prototype, because t oday nobody can be motivated to work on frivolities. Over the last few years extremely hard work was done under almost impossible conditions and the mo st extraordinary results achieved, all of which seemed ordained to arou se a zest for further work. However, the desire to work is by no means overwhelming and entirely justifiable suspicion is everywhere. This is compounded by the fact that in spite of all the curiosity, nobody wants to be ridiculed for being taken for a ride by a supposed visionary. All this is more or less irrelevant, however, because the preliminary work has now reached a point where these difficulties will somehow yet be over- come, because the whole thing can be looked at from many angles. Moreover, because no responsibility must be carried for this indubitably fantastic affair, some will therefore participate when not hing is risked by doing so, because everything will be honestly and properly paid for, which even these days, when money is nothing more than a scrap of more or less beautifully printed paper, is a normal incentive for those, who gladly accumulate funds for their future leisure or out of sheer passion to succeed. The second reason why one cannot merely blurt out the news about the Repulsine (see figs. 30-33) and the Repu lsator (see figs. 24-26) is because the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"New Forms of Motion and Energy 69 already very shaky scientific edifice would come tumbling down, if the full scope of the reactive energy economy should become known too quickly. An upheaval of such a kind would then ar ise, which could not be endured in these days of food shortages, and the baby would be thrown out with the bath-water by those, who have only one idea left: somehow to struggle through life and to be free of all prob lems. Were this implemented, however, then the most marvellous things woul d come to life again, which compared to the present world situation would be a paradise. The trick therefore is - how do I tell the innocent children that the e nd has come for all manner of lusts for power, because a natural power is now a ppearing, before which everything else must unconditionally capitulate. Today this new power rejoices over the victory, which was brought about by the fact that the Germans - and this can be examined from any desired viewpoint - were unfortunately the best ex- ponents of a technology founded on faecal matter. Unhappily they exploited precisely those expulsive energies that enable us, for example, to rid ourselves of those substances so vital to the Eart h for maintaining the eternal renewal of her motive forces. With the aid of these earthly and other waste materials she recreates everything anew, which our evolutionally older descendants absolutely require for their various n ecessities of life. For this reason wise Nature will not hesitate much longer before she clears everything off the green dissection-table with a single sweep of the hand, as it were, upon which, using decimal scales and an inch ruler, attempts were made to discover the 'essence', namely, that which provides for the weight and measure of all things. And thus, instead of specific el ements they found absolutely heavy remnants, which they then declared to be 'atoms'. That these remnants of a former organic whole, which have b een artificially rendered potential-less (stripped of life-force, so to speak), interact in a lively fashion, is quite obvious. Under no circumstances, however, do the products of synthesis that produce higher quality products come into being in this way, but only active forms of heat and cold. These promote the process of decay through further interactions, which in turn give rise to the decomposive and retrogressive factors that promote an accelerated disintegration as well as the annihilating energies that intensify by the square. That these energy-forms, which foster decomposition and are possessed of a force of resistance that increases by the square, contradict the ir rational assumption that they actually further the build-up of culture, is perhaps only incomprehensible to those who know nothing of the specific counter-elements and who, because of a tragic error, established the crowning law of contem porary technology, such that under all circumstances the resistance must incr ease by the square of the velocity. The specific counter-form, the upward falling weight as it were, comes into being when etherialised substances are transferred to the 4th d i m e n s i o n . This happens, due to the fact that negatively potentiated constituents of carbonic"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"70 The Energy Evolution acid are bio-centrifugated with the aid of cycloid space-curve motion and so strongly expanded by mechanical means, that they become free, unipolar, cool and highly active in a kind of ray-form. They consume (bind) the oxygenes which become inactive due to th e effect of this reactive temperature influence, when these seminal substances 6 , which concentrate around the longitudinal axis are dispersed mechanically. In this way they are made palat- able as it were, in a manner similar to branches which, swayed up and down by the wind, prepare or pre-masticate the food for the young saplings growing under the protection of the mother-trees. The ultimate products of this digestive process are the high-grad e forms of fructigen which, through a progressive series of transformative and formative processes, are produced in similar fashion, when one entity is cons umed buy a higher one, which in turn falls victim to an even higher lover. The fructigens thus produced are finally consumed by the Earth herself, who gives upward birth to primary products of synthesis, which are created through a progressive series of interactions involving the etherealisation of former fatty-matter derived, for example, from naturalesquely broken down and tr ansformed worm-fat. This ethereal- ising process then ur-produces the more highly influential substances in an energetic state, which the community of worm descendants once more brings to life and moves 'originally'. However, to return once more to th e cellar fermentation mentioned earlier, no combustible essential oils (alcohol formations) are formed, when through self-intensifying cooling influences, cold oxidising processes take place, which give rise to increased and qualitatively enhanced energy-forms, providing the metabolic process is reversed. That is to say, cycloid motion has to be initiated first. As a result, precisely those high-grade energy products arise, which influence the way in which the end-pr oducts and their later derivatives are created, and which then endow them with multiplying and quality improving potencies. This perpetuum mobile is also invol ved when the developmental process is intensified with Repulsines and, for ex ample, the substances contained in the air are subjected to the fermentation process outlined above. In this way the same thing is achieved practically and fact ually, but in a slightly different active form. In the same way that the end-prod ucts influence the more basic factors and cause them to move, they also cause them to be displaced upwards at cyclonic speeds; a process that also giv es rise to reactive forms of temperature at the same time. Using these reactive temperature-forms the floor can be made warm in a rational way. In spite of the forces that help us to overcome our own body-weight so effortlessly, providing both metabolic processes 6 Seminal or fertilising substances: This relates to oxygen in all its forms.

These methods will also almost completely exhaust the reserves of coal, which is no longer available in sufficient quantity, or is im possible to deliver to the point of use with the present means of transport (the true energy-gluttons), even if suffi- cient quantities were available for this coming catastrophic winter [1945-46]. It is therefore understandable that t hose who are threatened with freezing to death and starvation will fall upon this new method of heating and trans- port like beasts of prey, unless the matter is put in hand with extreme caution. This is the principal reason why heati ng with mineral substances, with which reactive temperature-forms can be pr oduced virtually without cost, must be inaugurated with great care. The se reactive temperatur es are activated merely when various allotropic substa nces are gently stimulated by active heat influences. To say more about this here would be pointless, because up to now nobody knew anything about the ur-causal ener gies that dwell in every substance, and especially in very ordinary pebbles. When these are rubbed together under water they produce a gleam of cold light. This is an indication that the bipolar basic elements are mature, ready for release and can be used to gener- ate those forms of temperature, which maintain us and all we see around us in the unstable thermal equilib rium that maintains health. In an already higher form as invisible suspensions, these same substances are contained in the carrier of life-substances - water - and can be made free and active with the use of Repulsators. In their relatively highest evolved form these bacteriophagous threshold stocks are to be found in the air. These indifferent elements of intermediate substances can be liberated by means of cycloid-space-curve-motion in so-called Repulsines, resulting in the intimate fusing of the former carrier-substances, which exit from the lower end of the apparatus, and immediately interact with the surrounding difference-matter, namely substances of a highly polarised nature. This leads to the formation of new juvenile air, which strives to displace itself upwards, because this increased, qualitatively-improved, evol utionally-older air cannot mix with the surrounding older air-masses, which have a different potential. Conversely, similar formative and levita tive energies are created in front of the intake through primary processes of sy nthesis. These, for example, enable the trout to stand motionless in torrential streams, or to flee like lightning upstream when danger threatens. Th is is a phenomenon that cannot be explained mechanically, because the fr ee-standing trout must not only over- come its own body-weight, but also the weight of the oncoming water. It overcomes this all the more easily, the mo re rapidly and torrentially the water containing these valuable threshold susp ensions flows, which are reactivated"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"72 The Energy Evolution by the cycloid-space-curve systems of th e trout's gills. In consort with the above supplementary energies, which squeeze the tear-shaped body of the trout forwards (see fig. 38(a), they then give rise to the above phenomenon. In a similar manner, naturalesquely cons tructed aeroplanes, submarines, or long-range weapons (air and water torped oes) can be made to move silently through the air or water at any desired speed and almost without cost. Stationary machines of all kinds can al so be powered by reactive fuels, which require neither mining nor other forms of extraction, because they are already present in superfluity. These are the allotropic bacteriophagous elements, which merely await the cycloid motive impulse in order to function as miniature dynamos and which through their translatory energies automatically produce the power that intensifies by the square. This explains the tremendously high velocities characteristic of those most highly developed expansive forces - ray formations. In order to throw more light on their origins, there are two types of seeds: 1. Those responsible for all physical forms of growth, which according to their degree of maturity fall down and upon returning into the earth, germinate and produce the increased and qualitatively ennobled forms of growth. These are the provenances of sweet-matter (carbones), or the 2. Seminal fruits, which having fulfilled their reproductive function, become dormant, die off and become the seminal substances, as it were, for the creation of quality matter, which after decomposition are then transmuted through 'cycloid-space-curve-motion'. By means of progressive interactions with reactive forms of potential, this results in the segregation of those elem ents, which in the form of allotropic intermediate substances were left untouc hed, whereas the more inferior sub- stances descend even further under even stronger influences of heat and are even further broken down. Once again what is still useful will be precipitated out and deposited, until the most inferi or substances of all attain their relatively lowest state of evolvement and thereby their greatest degree of sep- aration from the most noble, which on the other side has risen to the highest state. In terms of its height and dept h, this is how the above threshold- element depot comes into being. Therefore through a graduated process of deposition according to quality, the variously potentiated indifferent elements have different developmen tal periods. Those with a smaller separation inter- act earlier than the others, and logically , have to cover shorter developmental paths in order to reach the next higher evolved state. The trick was then to discover the appropriate development-facilitating forms in which, through intensified cy cloid motion, oven the relatively low- quality seminal-fruits sucked in by Re pulsines together with their carrier"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"New Forms of Motion and Energy 73 substances of water or air, could al so be whirled around at high speed in cycloid-space-curves. At the same time oligodynamic (decay-promoting) and catalytic (growth promoting) secondary influences also evolve and in this way the process of formation and transformation can take place within seconds due to the slip-pressures and suc tional forces, which intensify by the square. This is how it is possible to bu ild up the 'ur-primordial' levitative and supplementary forces in the form of metaphysical suctional and pressural forces almost without cost, in other word s the creation of an energy-gradient, which 'ur-originates', as it were, from dynamic elements in a latent state. This opens the way for practically exploita ble atom-transformation, or expressed otherwise, for the transubstantiation of former matter (fatty-matter) into negatively potentiated dynagens, tho se spiritual animating and dynamising rnergies; a transmutation that has been demonstrated many times over two millennia by the priest when making the symbolic sign of the cross over the Holy Grail - the extreme egg-shape (the calyx). All that hitherto was lacking was the practical design - the model - that proves what is actually obvious, namely, that with annihilating fire and decay-promoting forms of heat, no form of culture can develop. These models, which are now operational and available, merely await the 'extreme uncti on', as it were, in order to set them in motion and thus inaugurate a new age of development, wherein all privation and other problems will come to a natural end.

With explosions vorticity (turbu- lence) always occurs, resulting in a reduction in the velocity of the through-flowing substance, leading in turn to cavitation, viz. the corrosion on ships propeller or pressure screws in turbines. In particular when snow meltwater or glacier water is centrifugated. In such cases radar-like retroactive re-actions takes place, which as detonating events, have a shattering effect. The detonation velocity can be a thousand times greater than the normal combustion velocity, which explains, for example, why the resistance to motion increases by the square in all explosion and expansion machines, which also increases by the square of the velocity of an increase in heat. It therefore acts to impede motion. The cause of an implosion is the sudden binding (emulsion) of oxygen, which becomes passive (inactive) with a decrease in heat and in this state is con- sumed by the sweet substances, which attain their charged state at +4°C (39.2°F). The mechanical atomisation of the oxygen is necessary, however. With implosions a molecular ordering takes places in a radial->axial direction and therefore a suctional effect takes place in the axis, where the most vigor- ous decrease in heat and pressure occurs. This attracts, indraws, concen- trates and binds (emulsifies) the oxygen, which gives rise to diamagnetism. This is precisely the opposite of the atomic pressural force, generally known as elec- tricity. With implosion, detonationless retro-suctional effect s occur in the core zone, which promote a higher grade emulsive process, namely the binding of the oxygen, which becomes increasingly passive the closer it is to the centre of flow. This results in the collapse of the peripheral masses, the release of the through-flowing substance from the walls, and thereby to an almost friction- less increase in the ve locity of the self- inwinding through-flowing material, which accelerates by the square of the velocity of a falling heat gradient."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"4. New Views of Electromagnetism Magnetism - Electricism 14th June 1948, Implosion Magazine, No. 123, pp 18-23 agnetism and electricism are the two opposing metaphysical energy-forms, which regulate life and death and which dwell in every solid, liquid and gaseous (aeriform) mass (matter) in an allotropic and latent transitional state. They await the all-important develop- mental impulse in order to be transforme d into higher-grade (life-affirming) or lower-grade (life-negating) forms of energy. In the former case a magnetolytic dissociation process plays the mediatory ro le and in the latter an electrolytic. The belief that magnetism was a passive and uninteresting by-product of electricism arose merely because nobody was aware of the type of motion that gives rise to higher-grade energy-forms. Nor were they aware of the associated dynamic shapes with which latent bipolar dynagens and their carrier- substance can be accelerated in such a way naturalesquely that, in accordance with the equation F = ma, the force res ponsible for the increase in substance and qualitative improvement (ennoblement) arises with whose aid the relatively highest grade energy-form can come into being. This special form of motion, still unknown to conventional science, can magnetise a tripolar mass of air or water up to a maximum of 36% virtually without cost. To do this a particular ly constructed, profiled and suitably alloyed form is required, which promot es the evolvement of a development- ally progressive energy, the power of which increases in proportion to the centripetating rotational velocity. In this process it is possible to overcome physical weight and mental torpor effortlessly at almost no expense. Accordingly, magnetism is therefore levitism, the creative (metaphysical) counterforce to electricism, the latter being the decomposive energy-form that actuates gravitism, or physical and mental relapse (the death state). M"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"76 The Energy Evolution In this regard the following must be explained: Viewed as a whole, all matter is a tripolar product of motion in which lower-grade dynagen concen- trations, i.e. higher-grade qualigen in a pre-developmental embryonic state (here referred to as vitamin molecules), are present in an allotropic (poly- morphic - solid, liquid, gaseous) state. These concentrations of subtle matter are bacteriophagous threshold conformations (being neither corpuscular, nor metaphysical embryos) in which the opposing energy-forms mentioned at the beginning are suspended, which oscillate gently in liquid or gaseous media in a wavering state of equilibrium. That is to say, they possess too much levitational force to gravi- tate and too much lower-grade mass to levitate autonomously. Their inner processes of motion are sustained by the ambient differences in temperature. These, however, are insufficient to de termine the fate of these threshold substances as they vacilla te at this cross-roads. The decisive factor here is il primo movere. This is the mysterious motive impulse that Leonardo da Vinci sought in vain during his whole life in order to activate il primo motore, the organic m achine, in such a way that the intent of the original mobility-enabler - Life - could take its natural course. This can be achieved when the rhythmi cal process of motion - an interplay between components (sub-forces) of suc tion and pressure - is activated in a manner in accord with natural development. That is to say, the suctional component, which builds up the invigorating motive influence prevails and outweighs the fatigue-inducing pressural component. In this case magnetism, the levitating, life-affirming and relatively highest grade energy-form, springs forth from the above dynagen capsules - the vitamin molecules. This is to be compared with the tragic error in motion made by today's tech- nologists, hydraulicists and dynamicist s inasmuch as they produced the reversed motive impulse in all machines, whether for systems of conveyance or for the generation of light and temperature. In place of the invigorating suctional component they allowed the pressural component to prevail and predominate, which has a fatiguing effect on the moved mass. In order to give the reader some idea of the far-reaching repercussions of this disastrous misunderstanding of mo tion, the following will explain how energies that function in different ways can be built up. Energy in its almost purest state is produced when any given mass (e.g. airj or water) is propelled above the speed of sound in order to separate the lower from the higher grade and to ennoble the latter through magnetolytic (formative) chain reactions. This gives rise to the substance-increasing retro- influent 1 energy-form, which endows what has been increased with repro- ductive and evolutive potency. 1 retro-influent, refers to the energy form that revert s to physical substance in contrast to that which exalts to metaphysical dimensions oi energy. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"New Views of Electromagnetism 77 All systems of technical, hydraulic and dynamic motion cause the axial->radial dissociation of the tripolar masses of air and water, through which pressure, which generates lower-g rade heat-forms, increases by the square of the centrifugating rotational velocity. This results in electrolytic dis- sociative processes, wherein the oxyge n becomes free, unipolar and highly aggressive, and consumes and digests th e carbones (fermented fatty-matter), which become passive under this heat influence. Precisely the opposite dissociation is inaugurated when the suctional component prevails or is dominant. Th is is because suction, which produces higher-grade coolness, increases in propor tion to the centripetating rotational velocity. This invigorating (quality-enha ncing) suctional effect can only be created when a tripolar mass of water or air is radially->axially rotated at high speed about its own axis. This biotechnical system of mass acceleration produces upwardly flowing magnetism, whose formative and levitative force increases by the square of the radial->axial rotational velocity (see fig. 14) in a naturalesquely constructed, contoured and alloyed generating devi ce. This system is still unknown to today's purely mechanistic science, which is founded on too low a level of knowledge. For this reason any expert opinion from this quarter is totally uninteresting, because the scientists, who failed to per ceive the natural process of develop- ment, formulated rigid laws and dogma that do not exist in Nature's rhythmical interplay of forces.

This is the colossal force that maintains the whole Earth-ball in unstable equilibrium and whose revolution in cycloid- spiral-space-curves is caused and sustained by the above rotary (torque- producing) levitating current. By means of magnetolytic dissociative processes, this motion ur-produces the enlivening and originally moving (form-creating) retro-influent energy out of deceased fatt y-matter; an energy that gives rise to the hitherto mysterious processes of ge nesis and increase, and the qualitative improvement (ennoblement) of what h as been naturalesquely increased. In other words, it is responsible for the natural self-renewal and evolvement of everything that crawls and flies on this Earth. Up to now this formative, levitative, multiplying and ennobling natural force has not only been inhibited, but through the reversed form of mass acceleration has been transformed into the decomposive energy-form that destroys development-ripe raw-materi al. All this happened for the sole reason that air and water were moved axially->radially (= technically, hydraulically or even dynamically) inst ead of radially->axially, because it was generally believed that the earthly resi dues of former life decayed to dust and ashes! And so it came to pass that these vital formative substances were thoughtlessly decomposed or combuste d in order to produce lower-grade light, temperature and power. In so doing people literally condemned them- selves to death by the very sweat of their brows. The consequences of this defective moti on are so great that there is only one thing left to do, namely to reveal the truth with brutal frankness; a truth which, as a Roman poet declared, has been so cleverly concealed that only the sages understood it. Those who think naively, however, continue to go astray. As the mentally castrated so to speak, they do not perceive that they mis-earn their daily bread all the more rapidly by the sweat of their brows, the more conscientiously they carry out the processes and procedures expounded from lecture-chairs and pulpits. They have become the victims of an over-enfeebled mind and only after the most difficult experiences will they be able to re- acquire their innate intuition and repentfully return to Nature. To put it briefly and simply: We have been taught to wind up the ur-works like a clock, i.e. axially->radially. Howe ver, the ur-works that maintain the clock-springs of hunger and love in constant motion must be wound up radially->axially, because only thus is it possible to enable the suctional com- ponents to prevail, which produce lev itism = upwardly streaming magnetism. In reality, for the last 2000 years the opposite has happened. Only the Catholic Church, even if merely symbo lically, has indicated the naturalesque way to transform matter into spirit. On the other hand, in all areas of the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"New Views of Electromagnetism 79 economy and industry secular science inst ructed and taught the opposite 'wind- ing'. Therefore, in lieu of the evolution-fostering (ennobling) spirit, it raised and reinforced the demon in the form of development-impeding electricism, as if by conveyor belt, to such an extent that the magnetism-generating Earth, which moves in cycloid-spiral-space-cur ves, is now incapable of neutralising the decomposive energies and their effects produced by millions upon millions of human beings. It was therefore inevitable that we should be assailed by the catastrophes of Nature that we are presently experienci ng. They are exactly the opposite of those experienced by the Atlanteans, who realised the danger of over-stimulating formative and levitative energies only when whole sections of the Earth were wrenched skywards by these elemental (metaphysical) suctional forces. All today's machines, all methods of conveyance and the production of light and heat enable the lower-grade h eat-, light- and temperature-producing pressured components to prevail and predominate. Since no heat or kinetic equivalence exis t, but only the reactive intensification of development-fostering or development-impeding energies, an economic, social, moral and cultural decline had to take place as the scope of pressure- inducing machines and other such devices increased and intensified. Accordingly we have to learn the lesson from both extremes and balance out both forms of motion and acceleration in such a way that in accordance with the well-known equation F = ma, the desired force F in the form of a pre- dominantly magnetic ion constantly possesses enough levitational superiority to ensure that natural increase and qu alitative improvement can keep pace with the unavoidable increase in the populatio n. That is to say, the standard of l i v i n g must be regulated through the use of higher-grade (quality-increasing) retro-influent dynagens, which come into being when bipolar threshold masses are centripetated in acco rdance with the equation E = mc 2 . In other words, when they are accelerated by ra dially->axially in-winding forces to a speed exceeding that of sound under th e simultaneous effect of a falling temperature gradient, i.e. accelerated al ong the longitudinal axis above their boundary velocities. This gives rise to th e higher-grade factors of temperature, light and energy out of which upwardly streaming magnetism springs forth from the spiritual embryos, the vitamin-molecules mentioned at the begin- ning. These are suspended in a delicately balanced state of equilibrium in the media of air and water and await the naturalesque motive impulse in order, as refined subtle matter, to transform themselves into formative, multiplying and ennobling retro-in fluent energies. This will signify the end of the present shortages of food, raw material, ge rminating substances and fuels, and instead of capitalism and bolshevism a tr ue socialism will arise about which Christ preached 2,000 years ago, who taught of the transformation of matter i nto spirit with the aid of the above form of motion."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"80 The Energy Evolution Magnetism = the Function of Levitism and Electricism = the Function of Gravitism June 1948 (Schauberger Archives) Magnetism and electricism are the subordi nate functions of two metaphysical energetic magnitudes, 'levitism' and 'gravitism' which reign supreme over coming into being and passing away. These opposing executive forces are to be found in statu nascendi in every solid, liquid and gaseous (air) medium and in the highest-grade transitional state in the vitamin-molecules of the air and water, where they await the liberating motive impulse so as to be transformed into life-affirming magnetic or predominantly life-negating electric fuel concentrates (ions). The forces involved in these metaphysical transformation processes are in the ratio of 96% : 4%. The predominant force in this process can either be the up-building, formative motive force or its decompos ive counterpart. Whichever force is subordinate, down to a minimum of 4%, provides the resistance required for all types of motion. Everything is ordered through the agency of 'magnetolyt- ic' or 'electrolytic' processes of dissoci ation. Both energetic processes are of almost equal value, but differ only in function. If it has so far been believed that magnetism is a quiescent and more or less passive secondary effect of 'flowing' electricism, this was due to the fact that the type of motion fostering the creation of this higher-grade energy-form was unknown. Equally unknown was the associated shape in which this motion takes place, the so-called 'normal profile'. Up to now we have therefore been for ced to use flowing electricism for the purposes of generating low-grade power, light and temperature (heat). As a result, the essential formative and upliftin g force - magnetism - was relegated to the subordinate role of providing th e resistance necessary for all motion. That this resistance to motion must increase by the square of the initiating rotational velocity that produces it, is readily understandable because it con- cerns the development of metaphysical fuels, for which the force of resistance required for the acceleration must incr ease concurrently a nd proporti onally. For this reason the 'crowning law\" (the Conservation of Energy Law) of today's technology is fallacious inasmuch as the supposedly quiescent magnetic resistance to motion can be transformed into a 'flowing' magnetic motive force and conversely, pernicious electricism can be transformed into the aforesaid supportive force (resistance) . The means to achieve this is the Repulsator {see figs. 24-26) or the Repulsine (see figs. 30-33), which have hitherto remained unknown. The decisive factor in the generation of 'flowing magnetism is radial->axial motion and the associated development-facilitating shape. With this it is"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"New Views of Electromagnetism 81 possible to split up a tripolar mass (matter) by accelerating it along the longi- tudinal axis in such a way that, in accordance with the equation F (force) = m (mass) x a (acceleration), the formative, uplifting fuel-concentrate consisting of ions magnetically surcharged by up to 96% is created. Only by means of this concentrate is it first possible to generate energy in accordance with the equally well-known equation E (energy) = m (mass) x c 2 (speed of light squared), which promotes the naturall y ordained processes of formation and higher development. In this formative process the electrical fi eld-resistance is also responsible for the condensing of the higher-grade medium, which in the process of synthesis described earlier is essential for the physical encasement and insulation of every energy-form. The most important aspect of the magnetolytic (formative) dissociative process is that no low-grade heat-forms should develop during in this restructuring process in which, on the contrary, a cooling (freshening) temperature influence evolves. This higher-grade dissociative process was previously unknown and there- fore the reversed process was used to generate energy. Consequently the relatively most destructive form of energy was produced by very expensive systems of generation and used for the build-up of industry and the economy!!! Precisely the opposite can be achieved through magnetolytic dissociation. The naturalesque process of decomposition is one in which the moved and decomposing matter is cooled all the more rapidly, the greater the rate of acceleration along the longitudinal axis, leading to a corresponding rise in the periodicity of the rhythmical dissociative motion (viz. the rise in periodicity associated with the well-known explosive effect, which produces recoil velocities of up to 5,000 m/sec [16,404 ft/sec]) To be able to appreciate contemporary science's tragic error concerning motion, the following must be stated: No present-day scientist can explain or understand the quintessential nature of 'motion'. From a naturales que standpoint, this should be viewed as a rhythmical metabolic interplay between the components of refreshing (cooling) suction and fatiguing (paralys ing) pressure; in other words, two constituent forces which as reactive oppos ites, alternately (rhythmically) act mechanically (materially) and temperature-relatedly (physically). Therefore, depending on the predominance of either the suction or the pressure com- ponent (whether the active force is materi al or physical is unimportant), the metaphysical formative force, or the mo st elemental destructive force on this planet, comes into being. As the end product of a natural or unnatural sequence of motion, it will be accelerated along either the longitudinal or the transverse axis. In the naturalesque - formative - dire ction of acceleration, which must take place along the longitudinal axis (centripetally), so-called electricism acts as"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"82 The Energy Evolution the absolutely indispensable resistan ce for all motion. As the formative velocity rises, the resistance increases commensurately in order to provide the additional frictional (resisting) surfaces required by the accelerating matter. The actual loss of formative energy associ ated with this amounts to about 4%, i.e. in this case approximately 96% of the formative energy (= magnetism streaming upwards at enormous speed = levitism) is freed, which sucks up its generating device and a portion of its immediate environs in its wake. In other words, the 'all attracting' co mes into being and becomes active with elemental ur-force. In the unnatural, degenerative dir ection of acceleration, which operates along the transverse axis (centrifugally), i.e. in an axial->radial mode, the magnetism (= levitism) here acts as the resistance. Compared to the counter- flowing electricism, it appears to be in a certain state of rest, the magnitude of its resistance or support increasing commensurately with the acceleration of the downwardly flowing electricism (= gr avitism). This is the origin of the tragic misconception that in all motion the resistance increases by the square of the starting velocity. However, in reality this only happens when any given mass (matter) is made to move t echnically, hydraulically or dynamically 2 , i.e. axially->radally(centrifugaHy), therefore unnaturally. For if any given mass (matter) is made to move radially->axia lly (centripetally), then the upwardly flowing magnetism (levitism ) increases at the expense of the disintegrative (destructive) electricism (g ravitism) and thus the naturally ordained formative and levitative forces intensify in prop ortion to the starting (radial->axial) rotational velocity. With this type of motion, which is of course only possible with very special motion-inducing sh apes (profiles), the effective perform- ance amounts to about 96%. In this case only about 4% of the original forma- tive energies are lost in producing the resistance to motion required by Nature. In technical, hydraulic and dyna mic motion precisely the opposite is the case and this is how the enormous consumption of fuel came about, which is exclusively expended in a manner destructive of Nature. It cannot be disputed that contempor ary science, which is founded on far too low a level of basic knowledge, has made exclusive use of pressure-inten- sifying (development-crippling) motion an d arbitrary dynamic shapes that in no way correspond to those required by Nature. The formative components of suctional force, which act in an en livening (cooling) way, were completely neglected. Hence science created even more dangerous degenerative forces as purported successes were achieved to the detriment of the reactive formative forces. A more rapid economic decline w as therefore inevitable, the more wide- spread and more intensive technology, hydraulics and dynamics became.

In order to round off this understanding , the concept of 'mass' (matter) must also be explained in greater detail. Mass is here to be understood as the product of tripolar motion. It represents the partial solidification, as it were, of a motive force that is latent in a neutral carrier-substance and which to a certain extent acts as the resistance to possible inner morion (vibration). The interaction - or the inner motion, is only possible by way of the seem- ingly 'dormant' resistance to motion, whose resisting force also intensifies in proportion to the increase in the speed of the interaction. Were this otherwise, then the greatly amplified product of this interaction could not be concen- trated in this atomic prison (lattice) - (viz. the increasingly consolidated resistance to motion associated with physical acceleration, without which the latter could not happen.) The following is a brief clarification of these internal interactions: If a tri- polar mass (plus, minus and neutral) moving in an axial->radial direction is split up by pressure-intensifying and therefore temperature-increasing dynamic influences, then oxygen in a developmentally dangerous form becomes free, unipolar and so aggressive that it consumes (binds) and digests the sweet-matter (carbone), which beco mes passive (inactive) under such influences. 'Sweet-matter' is here to be understood as the essential creative (fertile) substance. The end product of this dissociative process is the electri- cally supercharged ion, whose initial decomposive force can be intensified through high-speed centrifugal axial- >radial velocity by up to 96%. If on the other hand a tripolar mass is split up by suction-intensifying and temperature-reducing dynamic influences , then the true creative substance (sweet matter) will be exposed to revita lising (cooling) temperatures. In this case the formative (levitative) sweet-matter becomes free, unipolar and so highly active that it binds, consumes a nd digests the oxygen (fertilising sub- stance), which has become passive under this other dynamic influence. The end product of this magnetolytic disso ciation is the predominantly magneti- cally charged ion, whose original form ative and levitative force, which as everything else in Nature is to be understood as an indirect effect, can be intensified by up to 96%. Imbued with le vitative force, these ions suck up the inferior matter and the generating device in their wake with elemental ur-force and encounter the natural and theref ore higher-grade forms of inwardly falling (impanding) and concentrating (con densing) heat and light moving in the opposite direction. The product of this partial concen tration, which has been solidified through these higher-gra de counter-influences is what is known as 'growth', (see fig. 15) Mass (matter) is thus a product of precipitation, whose quality increases in step with the essential produd of dissociation (the product of the interaction"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"84 The Energy Evolution between two basic substances). This is how the highest-grade element of matter, the floating vitamin-molecule, is created. While it contains too much raw material to be able to float up wards of its own accord (autonomously), it nevertheless does not gravitate, becau se it is already endowed with strong levitational forces. Indeed in this state, and after the loss of the higher-grade heat- and light-creating forces, it only requires a slight invigorating (cooling) impulse to transform such a mass of ennobled matter into the relatively highest light- and temperature-less state. Fig. 15 The manifestation of physical growth A small, temperature-increasing, material or physical axial->radial impulse suffices to transform such a concentration of highly critical threshold matter in a latent state into the relatively most powerful, destructive energy, whose decomposive force increases in proportio n to the strength of the impulse. Thus, for example, a lightning-like reco il in the form of a descending ion is triggered, which with elemental ur-fo rce disintegrates the resistance that brakes its lightning descent. Contemporary science (technology, hydraulics and dynamics) exclusively and without exception employs the motive impulse which unleashes this"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"New Views of Electromagnetism 85 destructive force. That is to say, there is no machine, no transport system, temperature or light generating plant, which does not make use of develop- mentally dangerous axial->radial impul ses. The same applies to all the operational procedures of forestry, agriculture, water and energy supply. All the watercourses and drinking-water pl ants are being systematically destroyed not only by this development-disrupting motion, which activates electrolytic dissociative processes, but also by official rules and regulations. And if this were not enough, this nation-destroying motion and way of thinking is being enforced by law! The more strongly the attracting forces become active in the developmental process, the greater the quantity of ennobled magnetolytes (ascended and magnetically supercharged ions) that so ar upwards with their adherents and the greater the quantity of less valuab le substances expelled by the highest- grade elements which have to solidify un der the effect of the counter-influences described earlier. And thus through th e proper regulation of these magne- tolytic dissociative processe s, the increase and qualitative improvement of the aforesaid product of solidification, or growth, can be enhanced at will. It is hardly worth elaborating further about the opposite case in which the components of pressural force that produce decomposive energies pre- dominate by almost 100%, i.e. the formative (cooling) components of suction- al force have been totally disregarded. Therefore with the best will in the world, no flowing magnetism (levitism) can come into being, due to the almost complete lack of the most fundamental prerequisites for growth and increase. On the contrary, everything that now grows (solidifies) already contains the germ of decay, so that in every seed, whether or not it serves an increase in raw or subtle (energetic) ma tter or even in energy itself, the fiendish demon must rise again. The decisive factor here is \"il primo movere\" - the powerful motive impulse of suction or pressure, which will dete rmine the fate of millions upon millions of people. No scientist can or will dispute the fact that up to now the axial->radial motive impulse, the seed-of-decay-developing impulse, has been exploited everywhere without exclusion or exception. The situation has thus arisen where those forced to work in the wrong way, the enormous host of working people, have had to mis-earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brows. In a manner of speaking, the Devil incarnate has emerged from the seeds of the Spirit, from these mysterious capsules, the vitamin-molecules mentioned at the beginning, and taking these development-ready raw-material con- centrates with him, has descended into the depths. Thus, through a retrogressive impulse at almost the final hour, the most elemental destructive force that ever existed on this fermenting manure-heap was generated from development-ripe ma tter, as if on a production line.

This O has H and C in tow, which have been drawn along with it due to cen tripetence. What is important here, is whether this process is permitted to proceed, 1. via warm, or 2., via cold oxidation. In the first case a surplus of water is produced. In the second case a surplus of air results. In both cases, however, bot h products have e volved and grown, and hence the product of growth is a multiple of the original seed-form. The better the earth, the stronger the growth and the greater the abundance of the substance. If air is produced, then water is in th e minority. The increase in this case is the air mixture and the 4th dimension that emerges from it - motion as matter. Out of this motion the 5th dimension ultimately comes into being, i.e. the radiant product, the spirit. This spir it can materialise itself. Conversely, a solid, liquid or gaseous substance can of course be spiritualised as well. Whether one desires to produce one or the other intermediate product is merely a question of the dosing of the intermediate process. The dosing of either heat or cold. The organ that com es into being either in this way or the other is a result of the organisation. Every organ is an aid or a means to an end that requires various supple- mentary energies in order to evolve. In its highest form, the developed product is a multiple of the ur-form, because th e potencies in it have developed them- selves. Potencies are nothing more than bipolar tensions, which de-stress one another and synthesise their desired form . This is the reason for the phenom- enon of multiplication. The function of tensioning or de-stressing is heat and cold. The product is therefore a product of heat or cold. The impulse is produced by either a cold or warm me diatory process. The place of birth is the egg and the orifice. The fertilised e ggs create orifices and conversely, eggs come into being from orifices. Radiation is the bipolar unity, the ur-information, which metamorphoses itself into proteins. Since information is also bipolar, then the space, the irtter- space and the shell come into being in this way. The energy evolving within the shell is space-energy, which like everything else is also bipolar. The heat-potential gives birth to the form and the cold-potential gives rise to dematerialisation.

This is especially true of water. It is therefore important to study the nature of water, its inner propensities and its capacity for onward transmission so that general and individual progress can be fostered through the possibility of its ennoblement. What actually is water? Whence does it come? And where does it go? Countless individuals have already attempted to answer these questions. Not long ago, Professor Gerlach from M unich declared that water was an unfathomable enigma, whose origins and reasons for disappearance remained a mystery. An old maxim states: \"All life springs forth from water.\" Water is thus the true source of life, which is reason enough for studying it in detail. Another maxim states: \"All life arises from motion.\" Since it known that with- out death there would be no life, there must be two forms of motion. One that produces the life-state and another that creates the preconditions for this to happen. In other words, there must be two completely different types of motion, which function in equally diffe rent ways. One of them produces the 'physical' life-state, whereas the other the prerequisites for it 4 by initiating the 'metaphysical' transformation and actu ating the processes through which the products of this form of motion can be brought into being. All birth requires fertilisation. Fertili sation, however, necessitates the dis- integration of the original ur-form. All of which brings us to the fundamental question: What actually is motion? This question is answered by a free-falling droplet of water, from which a horizontal ly and vertically radiating energy- form springs forth, the power of the horizontal emission corresponding to about 12,000 seed-volts as measured with an electrometer. These are referred to as seed-volts here, because in this case we are concerned with a charge- bundle which contains about 12,000 water embryos in an energetic state These are freed when a drop of water merely falls about 20 cm (8 inches). Naturally, special equipment is required to measure this capacity. To describe it in more detail here, would stray too far from the present theme, therefore clarification of the 'essentials' will have to suffice. If the horizontally radiating energy-f orm is conducted into vacuum tubed then on the inner periphery a strongly pulsating, blood-red glow appears. It 4 Viz.

With this we are already presented with the birth of water and the form of motion that induces it. The motion of a free-falling water-droplet is characterised by the 'cycloid- space-curve', which the droplet describes as it falls. To describe this form of motion, which gives rise to the metaphysical preconditions for life, in greater detail, which one or two doctors have called the 'life-creating curve', would take too long here. It is therefore here only to be noted that the horizontal emission of dynagens is associated with a spiral configuration of curves, whose transverse radius of action broa dens down the longitudinal fall-path. The vertically propagating energy-form, which in a vacuum-tube produces an intense and dazzling light - or a Sun in statu nascendi as it were - likewise describes a cycloid-space-curve path, but one in which the transverse radius reduces. The faster the water-droplet fa lls and the higher the vacuum-bulb is positioned on the longitudinal axis, the more dazzling and intense the light becomes. The further the vacuum bulb is removed from the source of the horizontally emitted energy-form, the darker the strongly pulsating blood- red glow becomes. If heavily insulated shields (such as paraffin wax), which have a braking effect, are interposed around this radiant energy-bundle, then under the influence of atmospheric light and heat, positively charged water is produced. However, if the same process is repeated with the exclusion of light and heat, then negatively charged water results. We are therefore not only faced with th e birth of water, but also with the determination of the gender of the birth product. From the sum total of these experiments arose a discovery, whose im plications first become evident, when we consider that it opens the way to produce water - the blood of the Earth- in any desired quantity and qualit y naturalesquely and in addition to pass on the desired properties to the evol utionally-older new-born entity. Water pipelines are therefore no longer necessary in order make what is nothing less than the most noble water available in the middle of treeless deserts or salt- water wastes. This not only ingeniousl y solves the problem of living space for a constantly increasing population, bu t also that of food shortages. Good water - good life: Bad water - bad lif e; No water - no life. This funda- mental axiom, simple as it is true, ma kes any further comment superfluous.

The possibility for uninterrupted further work is now the only prerequisite for finally solving the core-problem - food shortages.

The Transport of Ore in Double-Spiral-Flow Pipes Vienna, July 1939 (Schauberger Archives) In 1933 a proposal was presented to the Alpine-Montan company stating that the ore from iron ore deposits could be delivered to Donawitz, not at the current price of about 3.50 schillings per to nne by rail, but at a cost of about 0.30 schillings per tonne by means of a patented double-spiral-flow pipe (see fig. 16 5 ). At first this proposal was ridiculed, because according to expert opinion either the ore, having a specific weight of 1.9 and therefore heavier than water (= 1.0), would be left lying on the botto m or the pipe-walls would be heavily scoured within a short space of time, a nd therefore the proposal would not be commercially viable. In order to counter these opposing view s practically, test pipes 64 metres long with an internal diameter of 27.5 cm (11 inches) were fabricated. At a gradient of 1%, ore and pebbles with a grai n-size of about 10 cm (4 inches) in cross-section were transported down th e pipe. The experiments were carried out at Kohlleben. The steeper the geological gradient was, the more effi- cacious the transport. The experts from Alpine-Montan and the then Ministry of Agriculture were forced to admit that ore, stones, minera l coal - in short, bodies heavier than water, were in fact transported down th e flow-axis of the pipe without touch- ing the walls. The speed of the ore, which moved silently along the pipe-axis, was so great that the passage of lumps of ore larger th an fist-size could not even be observed in the crystal-clear water through the observation windows. Even at the point of discharge, the speed was too great to be able to discern the stones, etc. In order to ascertain the uninhibited motion of the transported material, small wire baskets were placed at the end of the pipe in order to determine the flow velocity and the actual position and motion of the heavy bodies down the axis of the pipe. 5 See also figs. 8 & 9 and associated patent descrip tions in The Water Wizard, Vol I of the Ecotechnology series. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The Nature of Water, Its Conduction and Use for Transport 93 Fig. 16: Pipe cross-section showing double spiral flows 6 After this practical demonstration, it was announced that the quantity of ore available for transport was falling by the month and that it would no longer be profitable to build a second such pipe-line alongside the existing railway, because it might be necessary to shut do wn the blast-furnaces altogether and to close the business temporarily. The whole affair was no longer pursued owing to the deteriorating eco- nomic situation. 6 In regard to the carrying capacity of wooden pipe s, the following passage from a book 'The Australian Wood Pipe Company' (p. 21, publ. circa 1910) provides in teresting insights. \"It is conceded that smooth- ly-planed timber has the lowest coefficient of fricti on of all materials ordinarily employed for conveying water. Many extensive experiments have been made on the flow of water in va rious kinds of pipe oper- ating under many conditions. Within the last few years, the United States Department of Agriculture has carried on a very extensive series of experiments on the flow of wate r in Wood-Stave Pipe, and attention is called to their Bulletin No. 376, and in particular to the conclusions therein: Conclusions. 'That the data now existing does not show that the Capacity of Wood-Stave pipe either increases or decreases with age. That wood pipe will convey about 15 per cent more water than a ten- year-old cast iron pipe or a new riveted pipe, and about 25 per cent more than a cast iron pipe 20 years old, or a riveted pipe ten years old.' The conclusion of Government experiments, as give n above, definitely prove that the carrying capacity of Wood-Stave Pipe is from 15 percent to 25 per cent greater than metal pipe, with the additional advantage that Wood- Stave Pipe will remain smooth and clean in ternally throughout its entire life.\"- Ed."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"94 The Energy Evolution Since interest in this ore-transport h as now been revived by a third party, the following description of the met hod of transporting bodies heavier than water, which contradicts known scien tific opinion, is still relevant. It is known that a few rivers not only transport their heavy sediment to the sea, but despite the resistance of the h eavy sea-water, actually carry it far out and form promontories (haff formation). Rivers that warm up along their course, deposit their sediment, silt up the channel and form deltas, so that instead of the formation of new dry land, marsh- and swampland have created. The secret of the dwindling and disappearance of the tractive force and carrying capacity in a naturally flowing stream lies in the way it moves. The origins of all motion are differen ces in potential. If these differences cannot be maintained during flow, the water's kinetic energy wanes and the sediment is deposited in the wrong place. New bends are formed in this way, which have a greater significance than has hitherto been assumed. The river-bend or curve is the cradle of water. Due to the water's swaying and swirling motion, processes of atomic transformation take place within the inner structure of the water, which have escaped the notice of the world of experts. The straightening of a watercourse in order to shorten it and steepen the geological gradient results in an even stronger deposition of sediment and even greater flattening of the geological gradient, a widening of the channel, the warming of the water and its even more rapid disappearance. 7 The amount of energy lost when a river discharging about 500 m 3 /sec is warmed to about +22°C (+72°F) amounts to about 45 million kilowatts or 57 million horsepower per second. This energy loss should be viewed as a form of latent energy, which is lost with a dynamic form of motion, but can be gained by a bio-dynamic form 8 , for which experimental proof is available. The energy that can be gained through bio-dynamic motion manifests itself in an increase in tractive force and ca rrying capacity, which appear primarily in the pipe-axis. Here the water is densified inhomogenously, because its contained gases are transformed into non-spacial dynagens. 9 As a result the core-water surges ahead like a ball of energy with increasing velocity. Dynamically conducted water, on the other hand, generates motion- impeding gases. 7 This is due to the abnormal evaporation rate caus ed by extended surface expos ure and excessive infil- tration into the ground due to the downward displace ment of the +4°C (+39.2°F) anomaly zone. — Ed. 8 Dynamic — Bio-dynamic: Here Viktor Schauberg er differentiates between conventional hydraulics and naturalesque water flows. — Ed. 9 Inhomogenously: Since some of the water's gases are transformed into a non-spacial state through densation and the remaining water is densified through cooling, two diffe rent states of densation exist and therefore the water is densified inhomogenously . Similarly, despite the overall cooling of the water, the peripheral flow are always warmer than the central core. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"The Nature of Water, Its Conduction and Use for Transport 95 In patented double-spiral-flow pip es the peripheral water-masses are caused to swirl within and about themselves and around the central pipe- axis. This produces differences in potentia l between the peripheral and core waters, which lead to an accelerated flow resulting from the energising and ennobling of the bio-dynamically moved water. The bio-dynamic movement of water is thus the form of motion that leads to culture per se or the inner culture of the water. If the concept of 'culture' were to be defined naturalesquely then it should be interpreted as \"the protection of Nature's pre-acting fundamental processes\". This is only possible by taking care of what it is that is moved, for as mentioned earlier, naturalesque motion leads to the vivification of the life-carrier - water - and unnatural motion to its mortification, or its death and disappearance. The open secret of water consists in the fact that processes of organic synthesis take place in the naturalesque conduction of water, whereas processes of organic analysis occur when it is conducted unnaturally. In the former case, the growth of water and an increase in la tent energy occurs, hence a qualitative improvement. In the latter case, it results in the disappearance of water, to losses in latent energy and logi cally to a decline in quality. It would deviate too far from the theme at hand to elaborate the inner processes of motion of naturally or unnaturally conducted water in greater detail. It is worth mentioning briefly, however, that the water discharged from such an ore transportation system is the most ideal regulator of the down- stream flow regime of a river below it, because the enormous energies generated through double-spiral conduction restore the river's kinetic energies, which to a certain extent we re lost through its unnatural regulation. Compared with current methods of transporting the present 3 million tonnes of ore by rail, not only can 9 million Marks be saved, but the large rivers can be reinvigorated at the same time, thus becoming dynamic, fresh and healthy through an unimaginable boost of energy from the double- spiral-flow pipe installation. Fresh and healthy water is the first priority for the culture of any country.

People who are mentally lim ited or who have no natural creative ability as a rule are said to be bird-brain ed. This is a bird, however, that can grow into a veritable bird of prey, whic h here is to be interpreted as mindless greed, idiocy or other similar traits. To the latter breed belong those, for ex ample, who bore holes into the organ- ism - Earth - in order to obtain oil, wh ich they then distil so as to make use of the distilled product, petrol (gaso line) to fuel conveyances on land, water and in the air. Crude oils belong to the genus of physi cal manifestations that are incapable of reproduction. They are formations that missed their way on evolution's developmental path and rightly belong to the genus of mules, in which connection the donkey is also known to have made a mess of the normal progress of development. Seen from this angle, distilled crude oil is to be considered as a kind of super-mule, produced by humans who think they can cleverly outsmart Nature. Apart from those who are happy to extract Nature's failed products such as oil, directly from the ground, there are others who make it their life's work, so to speak, to earn their living by meddli ng in wise Nature's affairs. These species of human being are commonly called chemists, who are known to pro- duce products of fermentation without taking Nature's dynamic processes into account. Without this there is no possibility for reproduction and further development of any kind, because things possessing these properties have come into being through movement, during which differences in temperature arise that initiate intermediate metabo lic processes. These then give rise to flow-alternating processes that engender products of organic synthesis, which is what concerns us here. The last paragraph is already rather difficult to understand, because today nobody knows the true meaning of the expr ession 'product of organic synthesis'. Such a person is therefore unable to un derstand that here too, as elsewhere, differences also exist. Differences are very noteworthy things, and for this reason: Without differ- ences in charge or potential, for example, there would be no motion of any kind, and therefore in terms of the above interpretation, there would be no reproduction or further development; in a word, there would be no evolution. Conversely, this means that the generation or ur-procreation of natural- esque differences actuates naturalesque forms of motion through which, for example, 'evolution' can be formed and fashioned in countless ways. At this point the creation or ur-gener ation of naturalesque potential differ ences should be examined in more detail in order to wr-create the driving forces and propellants, which neither burn, nor stink or make a loud noise.

If one looks at the matter very closely, however, they are actu- ally poor wretches, who put their existence, their heads and their necessities for life at risk, because it is dangerous, particularly in time of war, to attempt to lead persons in authority around by the nose. After this introduction we shall now attempt to describe the enormous difference between differences in poten tial in the only way possible for an unscientific observer of Nature. There are two observations that afford an insight into natural processes, which if taken to their proper conc lusion, open up unimaginable possibilities. 1. It is a known fact that in high-pr essure boilers a reflux from high to medi- um pressure takes place under certain circumstances without the hermetic seal being broken 10 . Up to now this occurrence could not be explained and because of it the manufacture of miniature pressurised boilers was aban- doned, which meant, of course, that veritable mechanical monsters had to be put up with, which consumed a great deal of space and material. 2. It is also known that minute bubbles of carbon-dioxide (carbonic acid gas) appear in good high-spring water, if the water is exposed to the influence of light and heat. If the water is again cooled under the exclusion of light, then the bubbles disappear. The crystal-clear water, however, tastes empty and insipid even when cool. Its former full-bodied wholesomeness has therefore vanished without trace. A third case will be mentioned here, albe it briefly. If under very particular external influences good high-spring water is rotated at high speed in turbines with blades inclined at a certa in angle, then on occasion the effective force rises exceptionally high; by calculati on to peak pressures of about 32,000 atmospheres, leading to corrosive da mage to the turbine blades. More detail ed elaboration would take too long here, and therefore it should be enough to point out that these three phenomena are known facts. 10 T he following excerpt from \"Pregnant Water\" (S chwangeres Wasser) in Implosion Magazine, No. 117, pp. 60-61, explains this process: \"It is a known fact that no free oxygen is present at normal temperatures, but that in the form of ozone it is loosely bound to nitrogen in the ratio of 3O 2 to 6N 6 . Were it otherwise, then it would not be beneficial to living things. It is only at +40°C (+104°F) that the individual O 2 molecules appear, which trigger life-threat ening chemical reactions in the human body and are the cause of heat-stroke for example. At about 1,000°C (1,832°F) single-atom molecules of O, identical to the oxygen atom, appear , which naturally have very specifi c effects. This is why, despite the hermetic seal, the high pressure in high-pressu re boilers drops to medium pressure once the above atomic transformation has taken place. Similarly, it is a fact that N (= nitrogen) is not a uniform basic element, but in reality is CH 2 , i.e. a carbone composed of He 3 (helium), wherein two atoms of hydrogen play the role of carrier-substan ce as it were. Furthermore, it is known that gaseous water and liquid water are quite diffe rent things. Gaseous water is OH 2 and liquid water (OH 2 ) 6 The strong action of gaseous water, for example, follo ws from this, because two free action quantities or points become active, whereas liquid water has no action quantities, because all the action points are filled with H.\" Viktor Schauberger. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"98 The Energy Evolution What science cannot measure or weigh exactly, exists just as little as what the farmer cannot grasp, see or feel. Because of this curious attitude, conven tional science has made a serious mis- take, which we have to thank for the ge neral economic decline, the world-wide unease and unrest, and not least, the constant wars. As long as this mistake remains uncorrected, any lasting peace is unthinkable, for owing to the serious disruption of natural development, the quality of the soil is declining, the shortage in raw materials is increasing and the various sources of food and fodder are dwindling in the same ratio that the population is increasing. It is therefore obvious that under such circumstances no lasting peace can come about. Viewed from a naturalesque standpoi nt, evolution or reproduction and further development should be seen as a sexual process. Only thus can the truth be established and practical progress made. Truth is an approach towards probability . The closer we come to the truth, the more bitter the realisation that today's science is a fallacy with serious consequences, because it operates with values that are no values, but utter worthlessnesses. Nature is careful and operates with r eal values, and the more valuable they are, the less they manifest themselves. Let us consider, for example, a fully-developed ovum in the body of a fertile woman. The reproductive product, the child, can only be woken to life through a particular forward motion, which takes place first. This leads to the influx of the fertilising substance, to i ndependent life and thus to autonomous movement. For this process wise Nature made provision for certain changes in shape associated with aroused or excited states without which the coming to life of a child is impossible. The actual formative instrumentalities are always present and only come into play under very particular pr econditions. Any human with the organic capacity can make use of one or the other attribute in order to beget the 'crown of creation', a young child for example, provided he or she is at all capable of becoming aroused and surrender themselves to the particular motion ordained by Nature for reproduction and further development. We have to follow precisely the same modus operandi if we wish to reproduce or further develop a given water, so as to ur-produce qualities and properties that can be applied to the widest vari ety of purposes. Naturally the same is true for other organisms, amongst wh ich air is also to be included. These two organisms (air and water) cont ain various ingredients that differ both in nature and kind. It is common knowledge that science regards these interstitial substances as the impurities of a substance, which it considers to be just as chemically inert as it does the carrier-substance itself. These supposed impurities are the carriers of bipolar energetic factors, which in their interaction with other factors in their environs manifest themselves as reproduced and evolved ethericities. These always appear as"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The Nature of Water, Its Conduction and Use for Transport 99 individualities and while similarities occur, identicalities never do. This fact alone suffices to show that any rigi d conformity to law or dogma-derived process is just as impossible as an iden tically formed product, for the form and type of the product of synthesis is determined by a process of constantly changing change. It was Heraclitus, who long ago stated that one cannot bathe in the same water twice, becau se it is in continual motion even when apparently still, and is thus in a constant state of metamorphosis. What could be more desirable than to move water or air in such a way naturalesquely that the beneficial and valuable inner factors attain their relatively highest state as ethericities, which on their part lead to the most beneficial processes of reproduction and further development. In order to clarify what has been stated in the last paragraph, books would need to be written. Here we are especi ally concerned with the production or ur-creation of higher formative and dynamic agencies (dynagens), whose essential nature will be described here to the extent necessary to enable mini- ature machines to function more naturalesquely and therefore better than is presently the case. Everyone has a fr ee choice either to adopt these new methods or to continue to believe that the scientific system, devised by rationally-minded individuals, is the very last word in mechanical motion. The practical aim of this explanation is the production or ur-creation of a hydrocarbon that neither burns, nor sme lls or makes noise, the essential point here being that it is of a much higher grade and therefore functions far more efficiently as a propellant than oil, which has been cleverly manipulated, or the synthesised product that the chemist calls synthetic petrol (gasoline). Everyone knows that so-called petrol (g asoline) is an explosive substance. That the creation of precisely the opposite is what is intended here, stems from the fact that we wish to proceed im -scientifically. With this tm-scientific product of synthesis we are therefore concerned with no ex-plosive product, but only with an im-plosive factor. If we study the inner processes involved in synthetic fuel production, then we can establish that, together with supplementary catalytic factors, strong pressure and high temperature play the leading role. Just a small heat-influence is enough to separate the higher factors from more inferior ones contained in good wa ter. As the condensing reversionary elements of retro-development, the la tter appear and become visible in the form of substantial physical matter. It should therefore be quite obvious that with the high temperatures known to be necessary for contemporary methods of coal liquefaction, the identical processes of separation and concentration must take place in increased measure. At this point it should be noted that this always involves a law of reciprocity, or that the bipolar basic substances are inversely related both symmetrically and proportionally."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"100 The Energy Evolution The inner ingredients contained in carbon (carbone) can be compared to the unfertilised reproductive or forma tive substances of a mature woman immediately after menstruation. Like the beads of carbon-dioxide in water that has been warmed, through the strong influence of heat the r esidual substances shrivel up after the separation and precipitation of the higher quality constituents 11 . Due to the high pressure the outer envelope or the carrier substance will be crushed and in this way the de-energised elements released. The opposite primary elements, the vari eties of so-called oxygen, will be physically released at higher temperat ures, i.e. they attain the so-called charged state that enables them to cons ume, or as the scientist says, to bind their as it were 'devoted' condensed counterparts. Through this metabolic process a transf ormation takes place that ultimately gives rise to a motion leading to a higher and a lower product of synthesis. This further results in two different current flows and the products associated with them. In the first case, this logica lly leads to the formation of a higher energy-form, which pierces through any enclosing walls and expresses itself as an emitted charge. In the second case, a marriage takes place between the residual substances. In short, the inferior product of synthesis that science calls synthetic petrol (gaso- line) is produced. The moment this second, inferior synthesising process happens, a pressure recoil (cavitation) takes place due to the emission or discharge of the higher constituents (viz. the pressure reflux in high-pressure boilers). Further examination of this uninteres ting process will be discontinued here, because the naturalesque and hitherto entirely unknown process is far more interesting than this scientific derailment of natural processes. When two people do the same thing, it is never exactly the same, and all the more so, if something is initiated un der completely different preconditions, which is here the case in a practical sense. The two bipolar inner constituents, whic h appear in a nascent state in every organic substance, should be viewed as latent energy-compounds, which require appropriate prior preparation in order to be combined (married) naturalesquely. As a result a product of synthesis is produced that is sub- stantially different from what science d escribes as 'synthetic petrol (gasoline)'.

This pipe should be laid to a particul ar gradient and oriented in certain direction 13 . It should then be charged with water - the best kind being sea- water thoroughly irradiated by the Sun - to which coal dust, carbonic acid and other things have been added. Together with its ingredients, the onrushing water proceeds along two com- pletely different paths. The peripheral water-masses follow a centrifugal developmental path, while the core water-masses take a centripetal one. Bodies heavier than water move down the centre. Bodies lighter than the carrier-substance migrate towards the peri phery, where they are thrust against the wedge-shaped guide-vanes, which de flect them towards the pipe-walls 14 . These guide-vanes are placed at certain intervals so that mechanical pres- sure is alternately increased and decr eased continuously. This results in the cooling of the whole water-mass, similar to the Linde process 15 , only that here 13 See description of the north-south a nd west-east orientation of pipes on p. 175 of Nature as Teacher, Vol. II and in \"Increase In Soil Productivity\", in The Fertile Earth, Vol. III of the Ecotechnology series. — Ed. 14 See explanatory figures Nos. 10 & 11 on p.4 of The Water Wizard, Vol. I of the Ecotechnology series. — Ed. 15 Linde process: (1) \"A high-pressure process for the production of liquid oxygen and nitrogen by com- pression to about 200 bar (20 MN/m 2 ) followed by refrigeration and fractionation in a double column. - Penguin Dictionary of Ch emistry, Penguin Books, Great Britain, 1983, p.399).

Through the indirectly engendered c ooling the density increases, whereby the frictional pressure is intensified by the mechanically-induced increase in velocity. The arrangement of the guide -vanes causes a spiral circumvolution, so that the bipolar ingredients, which rub against one another flow all the faster as their volume is reduced by the constant abrasion. Apart from the circumfluent motion another form of motion is also active which causes the bodies of the ingredients to swirl about their own axes and ensures their abrasion on all sides. Here it should be noted that experime nts established that all substances of terrestrial origin 16 react to centrifugence, whereas the higher refluent or inward-falling substances, namely all fo rms of so-called oxygen, react to centripetence. This results in the spacial separation of the two bipolar substances, i.e. the oxygen proceeds down the centre and the carbones along the sides, where with increasing slip-pressure against th e resistances (guide-vanes) and rotat- ing about their own axes, they continue to be ground off. As a result the inner constituents are freed and separated out according to their centrifugal or centripetal characteristics. We therefore arrive at the following transformative phenomena: 1. The inner constituents freed through mechanical abrasion (removal of the outer envelope) are transferred into two different states due to the cooling of the carrier substance. Through th is increasing cooling the terrestrial substances or carbones attain thei r relatively highest potential. 2. The stocks of all forms of so-ca lled oxygen travel down the middle and with increasing cooling become inactive and shrivel up like their counter- parts, the beads of carbon-dioxide in wa rmed water. At the same time these increasingly indifferent 17 fertilising substances (oxygen) are accelerated mechanically along the unrestricted ( no guide-vanes) and shorter central axial path and are thereby dispersed, or dosed as it were. (see fig. 16) 3. Through the rising acceleration of the ax ially moving core-water-masses, the centrifugence of the swirling periphera l water-masses intensifies. This in turn increases the slip-pressu re exerted by the suspended ingredients on the naruralesquely shaped and alloyed potential-increasing slip-resistances (guide-vanes). Due to the rising velocities the oligodynamic effect also increases, i.e. more and more supplementary influences are freed by the potential-intensifying frictional resistan ces and due to the water's careful 16 Terrestrial: In relation to oxygen, which Viktor Scha uberger viewed as a lower form of sunlight, this refers to substances that specifically belong to the Earth (carbones). - Ed. 17 indifferent: relates in this instance to a condition similar to lethargy. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"The Nature of Water, Its Conduction and Use for Transport 103 insulation against heat are bound into the water, which is swirled in towards the central axis by the inclined a ngle of the resistances - guide-vanes. 4. Having been drawn there by the increase in axial velocity, the water- masses inwinding towards the central axis now bind the highly active dynagens, which have been released through the mutual abrasion of the carbones. No longer reacting to any mechanical centrifugence, these energised terrestrial elements then begin to encircle the centrally moving oxygenes. Through the continuous approach of the through-flowing water-masses towards the anomaly poi nt of +4°C (+39.2°F), on the one hand the terrestrial elements attain their relatively highest energetic state and on the other, the oxygenes become increasingly indifferent and more dispersed, thus reaching the condition pr oper to a fertilising substance. If this state is reached at the anom aly point, then the highly energised terrestrial residues (the former car bones) bind their fertilising counter- parts, and the naturalesque pr oduct of synthesis is complete. This product of synthesis is characterised by the fact that the ratio between oxygen and its carbone counterpart is 4% : 96%, because all the remaining oxygen has been transformed into fertilising substances and then bound. Therefore the new product of synthesis has the highest negative valency and is  of  geospheric  character.  Certain factors relating to these processe s should be noted: In the scientific synthesising process heat has a shrivelli ng effect on the decisive formative substance in its nascent state, while ph ysical pressure ruptures its outer enve- lope. In the case of coal liquefaction by means of cold flows the increasing cooling on the developmental path acts to increase the potential. However, since the increase in the potential of the true formative substance is of a purely energetic nature, it would be unable to break through the outer envelope had this not been mechanically abraded through the circumvolution and inner rotation (about itself and its own axis) caused by the increasing frictional pres- surre arising from the doubly increased velocity of the whole water-body. These differences demand the closest attention and consideration. The product of synthesis obtained by means of cold flows, binds itself into its own waste product (juvenile water). Therefore apart from a new, fresh and more highly cultured energy, an associated carrier-substance of the highest order is also created at the expense of the gradually transforming (internally reconstituted) stocks of old water. Th is two-fold transformation represents the increase and the qualitative improveme nt of what has been quantitatively increased (the growth of water).  The finished product is a crystal-clear wa ter that has neither taste, nor smell, nor colour, because in this product of s ynthesis all kinds of things are on the loose or have been loosed ( e m a n c i p a t e d ) , i.e. they have been raised to the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"104 The Energy Evolution relatively highest evolved state, which is of energetic nature and therefore non-spacial.

If this product of synthesis, almost exclusively composed of geospheric energies, is atomised and atmospheri c oxygen simultaneously infused through nozzles (viz. other forms of fertilisation), thus charging it with fertilising sub- stances (these become passive at high centripetal velocity) and if this whole mixture is lightly compressed (warmed) by a descending piston, then the mixture is instantaneously transformed into the next higher state of develop- ment or aggregation, namely into air. Due to this new organism's roughly 1,700-fold increase in volume, an exploitable expansive pressure equal to about 2,000 atmospheres per litre (0.264 gal. 19 ) of such water is produced. 20 That this tremendous pressure expresses itself silently requires no special comment. That, as a high-grade air, this product of transformation has a more beneficial effect on the environment and development generally than the waste matter of explosive processes, also goes without saying. That this high- grade product of transformed air does not smell, is without doubt. In this way what was striven for has been achieve d, namely a far higher exploitable pressure than is produced by any form of petrol (gasoline). Moreover, it is an incombustible pressure-creating substan ce that neither stinks nor creates a din, and its beneficial effect can be raised to any desired level, so that in practice the smallest quantities are enough to achieve any desired effects. This ideal pressure-producing substan ce is the driving medium for power- ing the centrifugal Repulsators, which ur-generate the bio-electromagnetic vacuum, the most powerful suctional for ce of Nature's that could ever be imagined.

VIKTOR SCHAUBERGER IN LINZ PIPE FOR LIQUID AND GASEOUS MEDIA Application date: 30th May 1951 - Pa tent applies from: 15th August 1957 The named Co-inventor is Dipl. I ng. Walter Schauberger of Lauffen (Upper Austria) Many suggestions have already been made as to how losses in energy, pres- sure or velocity arising in the transp ort of liquids or gaseous media can be reduced. Thus for the purposes of inhibiting the formation of air-bubbles, which provoke an increase in the resist ance to flow, a British Patent No. 409,528 for a pipe has been published, which is wound in a screw-form manner and its cross-sectional surfaces are formed by two arcs of a circle. From the British Patent No. 28,5343 of 19 13 AD, the application of a pipe with an egg-shaped cross-section was made known, which was provided with flow-directing slats to inhibit the forma tion of vortices. In the U.S. Patent No. 1,655,197 as well as in the Swiss Patent No. 126637, cylindrical or conical pipes were proposed with the object of reducing friction by converting it into rotation, for which the pipe axis ser ved as the rotational axis. Lastly, the Austrian Patent No. 28099 depicts the use of indented and twisted pipes. This invention (see fig. 17) relates to a conduit or pipe for liquid or gaseous media, which is intended to prevent en crustation and to reduce flow losses, wherein the pipe cross-section is formed of several curved arcs of a circle and the pipe is coiled in a screw-form manner. The invention also consists in the fact that the cross-section is egg-shap ed with an indentation on one side adjacent to the pointed end of the egg and that the pipe is first twisted upon itself before the whole is formed into a coil. With the aid of such a pipe, the conveying capacity and efficiency is improved due the reduction of frictional losses and the prevention of encrustation. In order to increase the conveying capacity, the coiling of the pipe around an imaginary cylinder has proved to be particularly effective. For the same reason, the pipe can be rotated in a normal manner, whereby the central axis of the coiled pipe arrangement is also the axis of rotation. It is also advantageous to narrow the cross-section of the twisted pipe. In the attached drawing the cross-sectional form and the coiling of the pipe are depicted schematically. Figure 1 shows the cross-section of the pipe and Figures 2-4 the pipe in its coiled configuration. In Figure 1 the cross-section of the pipe in question is shown with a curved indentation on one side adjacent to the smaller end of the egg-shape.

If the pipe is wound around an imaginary, circular cone corresponding to Figures 3 & 4, then pipe cross-section can be narrowed either towards the point or towards th e base of the cone. Furthermore, for purposes of reducing frictional losses and the avoidance of encrustation, the whole arrangement can be rotated by suitable means, wherein the central axis of the coiled arrangement is also the axis of rotation. Patent Claims 1. The invention of a pipe for liquid and gaseous media for the prevention of encrustation and the reduction of fl ow losses, whereby the pipe cross- section consists of several arcs of a circ le and the pipe is wound in a screw- form shape, is characterised by the fact that the cross-section of the pipe is egg-shaped with a curved indentation on one side adjacent to the pointed end, and that before being coiled, the pipe itself is first twisted. 2. In accordance with Claim 1, the pipe is characterised by being wound around an imaginary cone. 3. In accordance with Claims 1 & 2, the pi pe is characterised by the fact that the coiled arrangement as a whole can be rotated about the central axis of the same. 4. In accordance with Claims 1 to 3, the i nvention is characterised by the fact that the pipe cross-section narrows in one direction.

Portugal: No. 29,729 - 1953 - France : No. 1.057.576 - 1953 - Brazil: No. 43,431 -1953 T his invention (see fig. 18) relates to a process for the conveyance of media in a liquid, vaporous, gaseous or aeriform state and which can be described, for example, as emulsions or suspensions, et c. Moreover, it also relates to the equipment required to carry out such processes. The invention also concerns processes for controlling molecular separation or reduction, transformation and synthesis with or in the media moved in accordance with the invention. It further relates to the procedur es for achieving increases in mechanical efficiency and output as well as equi pment for the carrying out of such processes. 22 Pursuant to the invention itself, it is essential that the media to be conveyed are imparted a movement which conducts them inward towards the centre, in the course of which the media are conveyed through grooves, pipes, etc. By means of such laminar, inwinding, and especially a multiple inwinding motion, significant advantages can be achieved in comparison with the methods of conveying such media in use today. This occurs through the transport of the media in channels, grooves, fluting, pipes or vessels with a cross-section in th e form of an egg, or more accurately part of an egg, having a curved indentation, which is twisted like a screw in the direction of flow. If pipes are used, then these should take the form of the long- itudinal cross-section of an egg, but with a curved indentation incorporated on one side at the more pointed end and which encompasses a quarter or less 22 Where the word Figure occurs in the following text in italics, this refers to the various numbered figures shown on the actual patent drawing shown in fig. 18 and not to those elsewhere in the book. - Ed"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"108 The Energy Evolution of the total circumference. In open conduits, the cross-section corresponds to a portion of such an indented egg-section. Under the term 'egg-shape' is to be understood the classical egg-shape or an approximative egg-shape. The imparting of an inwinding motion can also be induced through conduction along appropriately shaped surfaces. The conduits, pipes and vessels as well as the guiding surfaces can have a straight axis, although a meandering or screw-form axis is preferable. Through the combined orbital and rotational motion thus imparted, the conveyance of the media is facilitated a nd improved, and in this way a series of specific effects are achieved. Thus it wa s, that Professor Dr. Ing. habil. Franz Popel of the Institute of Hygiene at Stu ttgart Technical University was able to establish through comparative experiments, that in an indented or fluted, egg-shaped profile, wherein the indentation is twisted like a screw in the direction of flow, the level of friction did not increase with increased volume and velocity of flow. On the contrary, at certain velocities the friction diminished and overall it was significantly less than in conventional pipes of circular profile. 23 In liquids conveyed by this invention, the frictional resistance of the liquids on the inner wall-surfaces of the conductin g pipe is reduced to a remarkable degree. It has also become evident th at any variety of copper enhances or facilitates the inwinding motion catalytically. Instead of being wholly made out of copper, copper facings can also be used, which are affixed to the inside of the pipe. The desired results are achieved simply because the liquid comes in contact with the copper from time to time, the more frequently the better. Alloys of copper can also be used to equal advantage. Instead of copper, other metals belonging to the same electromotiv e series can be used, such as silver or gold. The best effect corresponding to the intent of the invention, is achieved with the use of doubly twisted pipes. These are pipes in which the indented, egg- shaped, cross-section is first twisted along the length of the pipe and the whole then wound into a coil. Apart from this, the desired effect can al so be intensified by the application of magnets. These are either laid conti nuously or spaced at certain intervals along the length of the pipe. To date it has not been known that it is possible to move liquid, gaseous or aeriform media in such a way that molecu lar activity can be controlled at will. With today's conventional systems of movement, e.g. in straight-drawn, smooth pipes, the through-flowing media will indeed be transported. However, a reactive, structure-loo sening tendency evolves as a secondary effect, which provokes further molecu lar disintegration. This cannot be controlled. These disintegrative events increase quite considerably with an 23 See the Popel Report on p. 219 of this book. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The Nature of Water, Its Conduction and Use for Transport 109 increase in velocity caused by increased pressure, additional warming or mechanical centrifugating, etc. If the molecular structure of a moving liquid, gaseous or aeriform medium is to be maintained or a process of mo lecular synthesis actually inaugurated, then the aforesaid structure-loosening tendency must be prevented as a first priority. The aim of the invention includes pr ocesses and appliances, which not only prevent unwanted molecular disintegration and the de-energising of the moving liquid and gaseous media, but also enable the achievement of molecular synthesis and a build-up of energy. These also l ead to increases in mechanical efficiency and output. In certain cases these molecular processes have to take place in a certain, special, rhythmical interplay of forces, in which expansion and contraction alternate with each other. By preven ting molecular disintegration or separ- ation, a condition can be achieved in which encrustations and sedimentation in the moving water or other liquid can be eliminated. In accordance with the invention, the d esired effect is achieved through a particular process, as a result of which the medium is primarily imparted a definite laminar, multiple-inwinding moti on. It is the special construction of these pipes, conduits or vessels that makes this form of motion possible. The molecular synthesis, recombination and transformation, energetic up- grading, bio-catalytic reduction, etc. is achieved with the processes associated with this invention: (a) through the laminar, multiple inwi nding of the media to be moved in these involution enhancing forms, fabricated with certain materials, and if necessary, (b) through the addition of substances of diverse molecular and atomic struc- ture or if need be, of trace-elemen ts, active substances and the like, and (c) through the energetic bonding (coupling) of the media and the added material by means of catalysts. This can also be effected by directly or indirectly incident rays of light of different frequencies, e.g. blue, ultra- violet light, etc. The stimulation of pulsation or vibration by means of ultra-sound is also possible. Excessive structure-loosening influences of light of certain frequency bands must be reduced to the minimum value prescribed for each medium. By way of example, the design of a conduit producing a multiple-inwinding flow-motion, which at least maintains the molecular structure of media to be moved, is to be provided with an ' open profile' and must exhibit the following features:"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"110 The Energy Evolution (a) it must have a variable cross-sectiona l profile, which is envisaged as having been derived from the pointed end of an egg-shaped form, whereby in one of its longitudinal halves the near-i dentical profile is incorporated as a concavity. (see Figure 1 - 'open profile') (b) It must have a longitudinal profile that is so shaped as to take the form of a wave, or meander, as shown in Figure 2a. The form of the conduit itself must be so constructed that along the length of the meandering longitudinal profile the convex portion of the 1/2 egg- shaped profile migrates from th e right-hand of Section A-A 1 , via the neutral point of Section B-B 1 , rising to its extreme value again on the left-hand side of Section C-C 1 . In this process of migration the size of the indentation gradually reduces and displaces laterally. In natural channels (streams, rivers, etc.) the previously described channel shape is the prerequisite for inwinding motion. Natural channels are therefore the prerequisite for the regeneration of the watercourse and for the main- tenance of the biological laws of bio-hydraulics. If the previously described, partia l egg-profile containing the convex indentation is supplemented by fully rounded, longitudinal portion on the opposite side, then the cross-sectional fo rm of the 'closed profile' is produced (Figure 3 ). In Figure 4, by way of example, an arrangement is depicted in which a pipe with a closed profile is wound around the outer face of an imaginary cylinder. This design can be usefully applied, for example, to drinking water pipe- lines, the reticulation of industrial water and for pipelines of all kinds. If in addition an acceleration of the fl ow is desired, i.e. for purposes of reducing the cross-sectional area and th e resultant savings in costs of the pipes themselves, then these specially prof iled, closed pipes, either singly or severally, can be wound around and attached to a cylindrical core (Figure 4), which is then made to rotate. Th e volume conveyed and the increase in mechanical efficiency and output can be regulated by varying the rate of rotation. This arrangement is particularly suited to the conveyance of liquid, gaseous and aeriform media. A further example of the design, which serves for certain syntheses (trans- formative, recombinant and upgrading processes), is depicted in Figure 5a, 5b, In these configurations the closed profile shown in Figure 3 can also be used. In this design a pipe possessing the said profile is wound around a conical, rotating core. Depending on the desired purpose, the cro ss-sectional profile either reduces in size towards the point of the cone (Figure 5b), for example, for the con- veyance and transformation of seawater in to freshwater, or towards the base of the cone-shaped core (Figure 5a), for example, for the separation of mixtures."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"The Nature of Water, Its Conduction and Use for Transport 111 For particular applications, several such pipes can be connected top to top, or bottom to bottom (for example, in the stimulation of pulsations for processes of synthesis). Likewise several such twisted pipes can be grouped about a common axis. Open, slotted, perforated or partia lly open and closed pipes and pipe systems of the above type can also be used, for example, to achieve diffusive or filtering effects. With the possibility of regulating the ro tational velocity of such pipes or pipelines, not only can the discharge ve locity of the media be increased and with it an increase in mechanical effici ency and output, but also the speed of the molecular transformation can be controlled. On the other hand, with a non-rotating pi pe configuration of similar nature, the process of molecular transformation takes place over a correspondingly longer pathway. Experiments have shown that a particularly useful shape of vessel can be developed from the egg-shape and is especially suited to the mixing, stirring, etc., of media, or the carrying out of biochemical processes and fermentation processes. This shape can also be developed from rotating egg-shaped or ovoid bodies or if necessary from paraboloi d or hyperboloid, rotating bodies and the like, whereby these vessels can lik ewise be set in regulable rotation as the case demands. The driving mechanism for all these ro tating bodies can also be designed in such a way, that these bodies are imparted a rhythmically alternating direction of rotation. Drives of this nature re quire no further elaboration here, since they are already well-known to technology.

The intrinsic qualities of the material required to upgrade the water must be introduced in doses in accord ance with the findings of the analyses of the said drinking, medicinal and /or mineral water. The energetic coupling, the actual bonding of these additives to the media, is achieved through the interaction between the aforesaid types of motion. The bonding takes place by way of bio-catalysts inter alia through the appropriate c h o i c e of materials from which the previously described pipes, channels or vessels are made. In such applications, copper, silver and gold and their alloys have proved to be particularly suitable. However, synthetic resins (plastics) with or without mineral or metallic incl usions or crystals, or natural stone, woods such as larch, fir, etc. and comb inations of such materials can also be used. For example, in a vessel made with an appropriate copper alloy, water with a corresponding valency (healing property) can be produced."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"112 The Energy Evolution Catalysts and materials, elements, etc. to be incorporated must naturally have a specific, energetic proportional re lation, which in any event is suffici- ently well understood in the field of catalysts and their application. In addition, the energetic coupling (bonding) can take place through direct irradiation by light of various frequencies (blue, ultra-violet, etc.) or through the mechanical stimulation of vibr ation, as has already been stated. The distinctive, multiple-inwinding motion, characterised above by the orbital and rotational, inwinding te ndency of the moving medium (water, earth, air, etc.) leads to a drop in temperature towards the anomaly point of +4°C (39.2°F) and its specific den sation, which is the case with water in particular. These effects are integral to the po ssibility of controlling the induced molecular processes and to the achievem ent of a substantia lly higher output and performance. They can be applied to drive turbines, propel ships, loco- motive devices, aircraft, the conveyance of all kinds of media, to the raising of the carrying capacity and tractive for ce of the water in small, artificial channels, conduits or flumes, etc. The increase in performance itself is to be attributed inter alia to the substan- tial elimination of the centrifugally-acting, reactive wall-pressures. In all systems of motion of this nature, the speed of motion is increased. The process of molecular syntheses is strengthened through the increase in specific density. In the case of rotating pipes, pipes sy stems and vessels, a regulable reversed flow and/or counter-rotation occurs between the rotating forms and the media moving through them, which accel erates and augments the aforesaid processes as well as the mechanical in crease in output and efficiency. Accordingly, the areas of application of the invention are manifold and of extremely wide scope. The implementation of this process and the associated appliances has proved to be particularly effective in the prevention of encrus- tation in pipes, sedimentation in channels, the transformation of seawater into freshwater with a range of properties, the biological purification of polluted drinking water and general purpose wa ter, and in high-grade molecular syntheses.

On the 22nd of January (1936) I was granted a patent (No. 145,141) for an air-turbine (a breathing machine) (see fig. 19). The principle of this vacuum-turbine consists in the fact th at an artificial thunderstorm, or high- tension electrical charge develops in a capillary tube and a double-spiral pipe in which electromagnets have been inco rporated, which transforms the sub- stances of the air into electrical energi es. These discharge into the sidewalls and from there, through diffusion, ar e ducted away downwards as heat. Through the transmutation of aeriform matter into energies, a self-intensifying physical vacuum is created in an upward direction and through the recurrent development of a heat gradient in a downward direction, a powerful upcurrent of air evolves, which after a few minutes intensifies to cyclonic force. Because the air-pressure in an upward direction can be progressively reduced in this extremely simple way, the counterflow of air can be raised to over 200 kph (124 mph), producing about 10,000 brake horsepower on the inclined surfaces of the propeller (turbine). This opens the way to the development of fuel-less, silently moving aircraft, because the physical vacuum evolving in side the machine at the forward end creates an airless space immediately in front of the machine into which the machine itself is drawn. Through the ap propriate adjustment of the internal system of lungs or gills, the intensity of this suction can be varied. In this way the motive force and the speed of the a pparatus can be increased as desired, A"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"116 The Energy Evolution because the repulsing reverse-thrusting pi ston-like columns of air are them- selves the fuel. Once this fu el has been decomposed an alytically, it triggers the physical counter-current through which the suctional forces arise. With this invention I have finally ach ieved what I have been striving for these last 20 years, namely to make th e use of coal, oil and hydro-power no longer viable. These substances are predestined for the production of food Their increasing extraction from the organism of the Earth will inevitably lead to problems of food supply, because the constantly rising world population increasingly robs the Earth of those substances that support life. Since no combustion processes are involved, the aeriform substances transformed in the machine create very high-grade nitrogenous material, which increases the vitality and germinating capacity of the ve getation. Thus I have struck a blow against the technologists, who utilise the substances required for food production to create motion by means of hot combustion and hence bring the natural processes of growth to a complete standstill. Air-masses super-saturated with oxygen will become the sole fuel of the future. This will reduce the mechanical and physical air pressure on the Earth and even in low-lying areas, mountain air-conditions conducive to increasing the vegetation will prevail and at the same time tropical changes of climate will eventuate, which will counteract th e coming ice-age. These machines will completely change the whole of the world economy and make wars, etc. unnecessary, because a superfluity of vegeta ble matter will automatically arise. Of necessity this will have to be c onsumed, if the creation of excess negative energies, as happens today, and therefore the development of elemental catas- trophes are to be avoided. In this wa y charity and tolerance will become the dictates of reason, because the increasi ng turnover will be transformed into prosperity. That is to say, that love of one's neighbour, which cannot be instilled with threats of hell and damna tion, will become established in this way and indeed will actually become an object of speculation for humanity. I am now working feverishly on the completion of this highly simple and cheap breathing-machine and I hope to be able to show you the finished work at the end of the month. Then your work begins, namely the work of the Sermon on the Mount, the call to reason, whose purpose is the turning inside out of contemporary economics and falsities. It is fate that has brought us together. I reiterate emphatically that you can rely on me 100%, because I am in a position to furnish you with material that will make the whole world sit up and take notice and will create such a stir, that people will come to you from all corners of the Earth once you begin to preach. It is my job to research to seek and to unveil. Your job is to speak and explain and in this way your circle of business acquaintances will become what it should be; the focus of power that spreads like a wave and e nvelopes whatever is still possessed of a spark of reason."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"The Air Turbine 117 The Vacuum Turbine From Spec. Ed. Mensch und Technik, Vol. 2, 1993, section 7.6. The principle of this vacuum turbine consis ts in the fact that in a capillary tube and a double-spiral pipe in which elect romagnets have been incorporated, an artificial thunderstorm or high electrical atmospheric charge develops, which transmutes the elements of the air in to electrical energies. These discharge themselves into the sidewalls and fro m there are conducted downwards as heat by way of diffusion. Through the re-formation of aeriform substances into energies, a self-intensifying physical vacuum is created in a forward or upward direction and owing to the succession of downwardly directed heat-gradients, a strong upcurrent of air develops, which after a few seconds intensifies  to  cyclonic  force.  This provides the basis for silent, fuel-less aircraft, for through the physical vacuum created inside the machine, an airless space develops in front of it into which the machine itself is sucked. This suction can be intensified at will through the appropriate adjustment of the system of gills and lungs in the machine's interior, so that the motive force and the speed of the apparatus can be likewise increased as desired, because the repulsing air-piston is the actual propellant which, decomposed analytically, unleashes the physical counterflow. The Formation and Composition of Riverwater A reply by Viktor Schauberger to a newspaper report - Implosion Magazine, No. 84. I thank you for your last letter and encl osures, which interested me particu- larly, because this is the fourth instan ce of rivers flowing uphill. These cases cannot be explained purely mechanically. In the Tatra mountains of Czechoslovakia there is a river, which over a distance of about 15 km (9.3 miles), overcomes a reverse-gradient of 64 metres (210 ft). These phenomena are painstakingly kept secret, because it is feared that an exhaustive analysis of them would bring about the collapse of the Law of Gravity. These state- ments are closely related to my own discoveries, which can be exploited practically and perhaps will change contemporary technology completely. Tackled correctly, power will cost virt ually nothing. Science made a gross error in defining water with the chemical formula H 2 0. Should there be any formula for water at all, it should look like this: Water is the most ideal accumulator a nd transformer in which the direction of movement alone determines whether magnetic or electric currents are pro- duced. These are of organic origin and decompose either air and water, so that"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"118 The Energy Evolution the three primary elements hydrogen H, carbon C and oxygen O are released. Under the appropriate arrangements C and O combine to become organic electricity. The freed H streams upwar ds at great speed and, through a double-spiral motion (a secondary spiral flow about a primary spiral path), attracts to itself the difference-matter (variously potentiated elements) of the air, resulting in the recreation of water and air. If the vortical current streaming upwards in a specially constructed tube is braked against a propeller, then at a rate of 4,000 litres (141.25 ft 3 ) of air per second, which rise at a velocity of 200 kmh (124 mph), this produces an active force on the shaft amounting to 996 hp. To analyse 4,000 litres of air only 3 - 4 hp are required, so that the above 996 hp represent free, usable energy. This kinetic principle is founded on thermo -electric processes that we can observe in Nature in the formation of cyclones, storms, etc. These implosive processes can be simulated artificially and enable tremendous energies to be unleashed in the smallest machines, when organic catalysts, similar to those in the lungs and gills, are agitated and which dissociate either water or air into its basic constituents. The dissociated H is th e attracting magnet for the surrounding air-masses, which in the process become so condensed, that inside the machine the potential pressure of the air falls by over 100 mm (4 in.), provoking a powerful influx of the air-masses lying immediately in front of the air-intake, which in turn creates a zone of rarefac tion into which the machine is impelled. This actually represents the discovery of the silent and fuel-less aircraft, which correctly simulates the flight of birds organically. Our work here progresses only slowly, because the people are heavily over- worked and we have been waiting for the components for months. We are here concerned with a machine, whic h should deliver 1,000 hp, requiring a driving force of only 4 hp to do so. What you have represented as a phe nomenon in your newspaper report will be a self-evident phenomenon once th is machine has b een built, because with it one can lift water to any height without effort and almost without any input of power. The Hindenburg accident in those days is to be attributed to similar processes of dissociation, or more precisely, to synthetic reversed metamorphoses. The crash of the American airship, the Akron, which was filled with helium, is equally attributable to short circuits . With hydrogen, fire is created, and with a filling of helium - water. Th e analogous counterpart to the helium synthesis we find in the natural formation of rain. One day it would be very interesting to clear up the question, whether humanity consciously or unconsciously lo st these simple processes of Nature. In my opinion, it happened unwittingly, because in earlier times people had no conception of analyti cal or synthetical processes and 50 years ago the science of radiation physics was virtually unknown."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The Air Turbine 119 It is beyond doubt, however, that the Atlanteans possessed silent aircraft (vimanas). It is at any rate possible th at at the time the priesthood preserved the secrets of catalysis, which in the course of time were simply lost. I arrived at the whole affair through observations of the motionless trout in torrential currents and throu gh the accurate observation of bird-flight, which without physical exertion takes place entirely through processes of diffusion 1 . I am convinced that we now stand before an upheaval, which will fundamentally change all realms of knowledge and belief, for in my opinion the discovery of the way to produce an abundance of food will provide the basis for all manner of political development. This abundance first has to be lost with the continuing development of our present technology, because it is only in this way that humanity will bring about its own ruin through its own handiwork and come to realise the stupidity of its activities. Re: The Air Turbine (Austrian Patent No. 145141 - 15.03.1935) Excerpt from The Discovery of Levitational Force, Salzburg, 1949, Implosion No. 115, pp 36-37 With high frequencies, which can be regulated as desired, this patented device produces an almost absolute void (vacuum), causing air to move at such high velocities per unit of time that any desired power can be obtained by means of a propeller- like resistance to motion. This patent is founded on the discovery that constant pressure or suction, whether generated by mechanical or phys ical means is immaterial, triggers a resistance that increases by the square of the velocity generated by either of them. This happens for the simple reason that under abnormally high pres- sure, for example, the state of aggregation (not to be confused with the natural variation in developmental states) of air is transformed instantaneously into water, and under strong suctional velocity, water into air. In the first case, by way of a reactive intensification, an almost absolute vacuum (or more properly, an almo st 100% air-less vacuity) is created. In the second case, a coun ter-pressure of such magnitude evolves, that any further attempt to achieve a greater reactive reduction in volume would be futile. The above patent (No. 145141 - 15th March 1935), however, has long been superceded and is therefore only of hi storic interest, because incomparably more powerful reactive forces can be generated, which increase performance 1 See how is a bird able to become temporarily independent of the ground ?' on p. 14 of The Fertile Earth, Vol. III of the Ecotechnology series. - Ed"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"120 The Energy Evolution] instead of reducing it. In the case of the above patent, if this process is merely reversed, then the following happens: The so-called oxygen of the air is co mbusted by two periodically pulsing electric (therefore decomposive) flame-arcs. This creates an exhaust gas, which can only be extracted by strong centrifugal pressure. To this end a very specially constructe d egg-shape is required, which rotates at high speed. This particularly shaped and alloyed e gg-form contains an equally specially shaped and alloyed system of curves, which only produces a reaction in the exhaust gases, but not in the renewed in flow of oxygen or any small quantities of combustible gases or liquids. In this way an expulsion of exhaust g as occurs, whose velocity can be effort- lessly increased to 10,000 m/sec (32,800 ft/sec). The velocity of this exhaust emission is inhibited by the full-throttle velocity, which can be raised by the square of the exhaust velocity easily and cheaply. The interposed brake-propeller transf orms these powerful suctional vel- ocities into useful power that can be regulated and increased at will. Modern science on the other hand uses this brak ing-propeller for forward propulsion, despite the fact that its use produ ces pressure- and heat-intensifying and therefore reversed reactions - and is thus a resistance-triggering device. 2 This fact should put an end to today's science (technology, hydraulics and dynamics), which without exception triggers the reversed force that produces braking reactions. For this reason it can no longer be claimed that annihilating fire and the temperatures, etc. arising from this epi centre of destruction are still necessary, if a process was researched and put in pl ace that enables the ur-generation of the highest-grade forces of pressure a nd suction that exist on this planet, which like the energised effects of urge and yearning, function at the speed of thought. This process, which involves the natura l acceleration of mass without com- bustion or heat, is therefore not founded on fire. 2 \"As best demonstrated by Nature in the case of the aerofoil maple-seed, today's propeller is a pres- sure-screw and therefore a braking screw, whose purpos e is to allow the heavy maple-seed to fall para- chute-like slowly towards the ground and to be carried away sideways by the wind in the process. No bird has such a whirling thing on its head, nor a fish on its tail. Only man made use of this natural brake-screw for forward propulsion. As the propeller rotates, so does the resistance rise by the square of the rotational velocity. This is also a sign t h a t this supposed propulsive device is unnaturally constructed and therefore out of place.\" Viktor Schauberger, Implosion Magazine, No. 112, p. 52. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Air Turbine 121 An Air-Turbine Patent AUSTRIAN PATENT OFFICE SPECIFICATION OF PATENT No. 145141 Class 46f. Issued 10th April 1936 VIKTOR SCHAUBERGER IN HADERSDORF-WEIDLINGEN, LOWER AUSTRIA. AN AIR-TURBINE. Application date: 7th March 1935 - Pa tent applies from: 15th November 1935 It is known that impellers can be caused to rotate by moving air. It is equally known that an air current can be gene rated through evacuation. The present invention, however, makes use of mechanical and physical forces. In the accompanying diagram (see fig. 19), the object of the invention is portrayed in Sections A-A and B-B. A snailshell-shaped housing a in which the impeller b is mounted is connected to a double-spiral pipe c by means of a hollow shaft d. The double-spiral pipe c is joined to an egg-shaped, hollow body e at f, which is divided into two spaces by means of a wire mesh g. In the inner chamber of e gas-burners or electric arc-throwers are incorporated that combust the inflowing gas at about 2,000°C (3,632°F). The inner chamber is connected to an exhauster via a heatable double-spiral pipe h. To this exhauster, streamlined, egg-shaped nozzles i are attached and the whole arrangement is activated by an external force. The impeller incorporated inside th e snailshell housing is constructed in such a way that fresh air can only ente r the hollow shaft d when the impeller- blade k passes over the slot j incorporat ed in the hollow shaft. The flywheel l, whose cross-sections are egg-shaped and which is mounted on the hollow shaft d, is installed in an externally ai rtight housing m. The air present in the hollow space n is sucked out through a c onnecting passage o, so that in the highly rarefied space n the flywheel is of fered very little resistance to rotation. To maintain the combustion process, a combustible gas is introduced at p. The double-spiral pipe c mentioned at the beginning has been granted an Austrian patent, No. 138296. This pipe consists of an external pipe made of wooden staves and an asbestos sleeve. W ithin the latter there is a metal sleeve, which has wood-shaving-like metal elements bent out from the periphery, whose axis is inclined toward s the pipe-axis at an angle of 30° to 45°. 3 These metal elements are aligned along several spiral pathways.

The inner metal sleeve is heated electrically. In addition, the heat arising from friction on the outer walls leads to the warming of the outer air-masses, through which in particular all the oxyg en contained in the air expands, con- centrates itself at the pipe-walls, b ecoming even warmer on its multi-spiral path along the pipe-walls. The remaining gases contained in the air pass down the centre of the pipe and rise through the agency of the gas introduced at p. Because the warmer and therefore more aggressive oxygen brushes along the outer pipe-walls and the colder residual components of the air flow through the inner region of the pipe, inner tensi ons arise between the materials due to the temperature differences obtaining, which become more pronounced the longer the distance travelled, until inte ractions ultimately occur. These inter- actions proceed in the form of small explosions and assist the reaction that takes place through the combustion of th e highly energised gases within the egg-shaped safety mesh g. In the egg-shaped body e a sieve (safet y mesh) g is incorporated, outside of which the separated oxygen mentioned earlier accumulates, passes through the sieve into the centre, wherein, with the aid of the electric or gas arcs, it contributes to the almost complete combustion of the centrally conducted combustible gases. As a result a much greater vacuum evolves than has hitherto been achieved using currently known methods. At the same time the exhaust gases are reduced to a minimu m and extracted mechanically via h and i. Through the creation of the vacuum in e, the air will be sucked in with even greater force, setting the impeller in motion in the process. Patent Claims 1. The air-turbine is characterised by the fact that the air-masses in a double- spiral pipe can be so strongly moved, that due to frictional heat and externally supplied heat between the peripheral air-masses and those streaming down the pipe-axis, differences in temperature arise, which lead to cold interactions in the air flowing through the double-spiral pipe, whose end-product is an almost total vacuum. 2. In accordance with Claim 1 the air-turbi ne is further characterised by the complete combustion that takes place in a partitioned chamber by means of a safety mesh having a pipe-shaped extension towards its base. 3. In accordance with Claims 1 & 2, the air-turbine is characterised by the fact that the attached flywheel is cau sed to rotate in a rarefied space. 4.

The body is merely an antenna, whereas the transmitter is responsible for the phenomenon we call 'motion'.

Fully operational, the machine must be remote-controlled, for either a violent thunderstorm or a cyclone will develop; If the organic H discharges itself downwards, then there is a short- circuit - a thunderstorm, whereas an upward discharge of H produces the celestial electromagnet, which is actua ted at about 40,000 milli-amps, and with it the charging up of the celestia l Plus + Minus, i.e. the cyclone. The physicist Renault produced a short-circ uit, which incinerated him and his colleague in a matter of seconds 2 . Perish the thought that it should first ignite 2 There follow some short extracts pertinent to the above. Here is an interesting extract from one of Schauberger's writings (TAU 145, page 18), concerning th e extraction of energy from water: — Ed. \"...and thus I succeeded not only in producing petrol-like explosiv e aqueous substances and the most noble high springwa- ter from dirty water, but also in recreating an invention, which the well-known physicist Gerard Renault had appar- ently made in his day (1926), and to which he and his assistant fell victim at the Paris Academy because he failed to recognise the enormous energies la tent in water and in the air.\" T he following extract from the periodical Der Weg (7 /11/1946,1st year, no 48, p. 12) gives a fuller indi- cation of what Renault was working with: The French physicist Gerard Renault had already occ upied himself with the problem of obtaining elec- tricity from the air. In his laboratory in Grenoble he worked night and day on his invention and even the scant information that emerged publicly created a sens ation in scientific circles. One day a machine stood in his workshop which was held to be a wonder. Da y after day its wheels turned without any observer being able to determine whence the driving force or iginated. Neither steam, nor combustion gases, nor electrical motive forces could be detected. The mach ine stood on its base, completely insulated from the ground, and ran independently like a perpetuum mobile . For a while Renault enjoyed the general wonder- ment, and then one day he said, \"This machine is in fact driven by electricity, but with electricity from the air! I have solved the problem. With its practical application, in a few years we shall achieve a paradise on Earth.\" The French Academy requested Renau lt to come to Paris so that he could demonstrate his invention there. The inventor agreed, hasten ing to the capital with his assistant, setting up his machine in the e x p e r i m e n t theatre. Just before the beginning of th e demonstration, he wanted to explain how it worked. His assistant was present. Suddenly there was a trem endous explosion, flames shot out of the doors and windows, and once the fire brigade had succeeded in extinguishing the fire, the machine was a heap of wreckage.

The first trial demonstrated an important law, namely that the Sun's rays decrease in capacity with an increase in heat. This gives rise to the possibility of producing cold light or cold fire ar tificially and in further consequence, the absolute cure of cancerous diseases. Through the organic arrangement of the cathode and anode systems, I achieve planetary motion in the machin e by adjusting the potential angle of +4°C (+39.2°F), whereby either light - th e primary ur-structure, or motion - the primary ur-dematerialisation, is initiated. If I set cold light and warm motion in a harmonic rhythm, then I obtain a growing motion, or the living force of the Almighty. So-called short-wave radiation is none other than hard unprocessed un- demodulated radiant energy, which can be generated to any intensity with the organic machine. From this ari ses the mutation, the inversion of the creation-of-motion, that is, the waxing motion-of-creation or free energy. For this reason I require an initial inward -moving force in order to set the machine in dynamic motion. Once the required revolutions per minute have been reached, then the warm motion begins to grow. If this waxing mass-motion in the double-spiral pipe is now slowly cooled, then absolute dematerialisation is achiev ed; that is, pure heat or cold energy and with it the separation of the Ur. This H is the organic polarity or the earthly motive impulse, which as a result of the relaxation of its inner tension now displaces itself and streams upwards. On its way to the pole, this nega- tive impulse sucks the aeriform substa nces towards itself, thereby producing a vertical vacuum or a cyclone in the air. 7.7.3: Notes from 25th July 1936 This week I checked over the machine, which intentionally or unintentionally had many faulty components.

It seems as though Nature refuses to reveal her final secret of bio-motion to me. Everything was other than I had imagined. Something was always missing and I really began to doubt.

With this machine, which can do almost anything, it would be a simple matter to create my own monopoly and peddle both heat and cold-producing devices, thereby raising funds for further research in other fields. The secret of this machine lies in the mirror-image inversion of what today is held to be true. Because of these misconceptions neither the economics, nor the results add up. In the sacred waters lie the eternal forces of the Earth and the air.

The princi ple has been copied from Nature, wherein decomposition (analysis) - (creation-of-motion) - and synthesis - (motion-of-creation) - take place by way of bio-dynamic movement.

The decomposition of fresh water or seawater produces the same effect, and the upward streaming hydrogen gas can eith er be made to flow through suit- able carbones or precious metals and mine rals, whereby in the first instance a petroleum-like substance is created and in the second, depending on the absorptive mass, a more or less hi gh-grade fuel-water is produced. The petrol-like substance can be made com bustible or incombus tible. In the latter case we are concerned with a nitro-glycerine-like substance, which can be dosed as desired. The nature of this s ubstance may be similar to the so-called 'Greek Fire' 3 . The raising of the liquid and the cooling to +4°C (+39.2°F) results spontaneously from the decomposive process and the ethereal structure of the product of decomposition. 7.7.7 : Notes from 13th of August 1936 After 20 years of effort, I have arrived at the almost absolute 'nothing', namely the near-absolute 'vacuum'. A vacuum-mach ine is a machine that is specifically designed to function with planetary motion and only requires an impulse in order to run for as long as the machine's organic components are capable of life or movement. A drive-motor is not absolutely essential, because the initial impulse can be given with the hand or by means of foot-pedals. The whole secret lies in the organic creation-of-motion and motion-of-creation, through which the bi-polar development evol ves spontaneously, namely the de- materialisation of the material and th e overcoming of gravity on the one hand and the densation of matter and physical growth on the other. 7.7.8 : Notes from 14th of August 1936 I stand face to face with the apparent 'void', the compression of dematerial- isation that we are wont to call a 'vacu um'. I can now see that we are able to create anything we wish for ourselves out of this 'nothing'. The agent is water, the blood of the Earth and the most universal organism. 3 Greek fire: 1: A Byzantine weapon employed in naval warfare from 672 or 673 AD.

Every whorl-pipe is a tornado, a vortex. The flow-through material creates a space-spiral. From the starting point movement is both inwards and downwards at the same time. The whor l-pipe must be cone-shaped on its longitudinal axis. In experiments with cylindrical pipes few noteworthy effects were achieved. In addition, there is also a third direction of movement, which seems to be the most important. It is a rotation about itself, which in regard to the electrons in atoms we call 'spin', or which we can see with couples when dancing the waltz. 5 Viktor Schauberger sought to achieve this rotation about its own axis with the ova l (egg-shaped, not elliptical) profile of a pipe with a rotating indentation on th e longitudinal axis. For this design he also applied for patents (see fig. 18), which were only partially successful. The acceleration of the in-rollment of th e flow-through material depends on four factors: 1. The length of the pipe, 2. The size of the intake cross-section in relation to the outlet nozzles, 3. The rotational velocity of the rotor, 4. The diameter of the conical rotor, because it is upon this that the centrifugal force depends. The rotor is a conical bell. The whorl-pi pes are attached either to the outside or inside of a collector. Due to the centrifugal load it is advisable to mount them on the inside. From the collector a suction-pipe extends vertically down- wards into the water reservoir of the machine. 5 In 3/4 time, like the heart-beat, the waltz is one of the most natural, dynamic, energy-producing, rotating planetary movements. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Early Developments in Implosion Machines 131 The rotor is driven by an electric motor, which is connected to the alternator or generator that produces an electric current. To begin with the drive-motor is powered from any available current source in order to set the rotor in motion. When the rotor produces more pow er than the drive-motor requires, electricity can be ducted off for other purposes. According to estimates, the proportion is in the ratio or 1 : 9, namely 1/10th of the output for running the drive-motor and 9/10ths as surplus power. The implosion machine is a there- fore more than just form of perpetual motion. The power of the machine results from four impulses: 1. As connected to the suction-pipe, every whorl-pipe is a siphon, whose function we know from school physics. As a fall-pipe, the whorl-pipe is longer than the vertical suction-pipe . Its exit nozzles are at the same height as the lower end of the suction-pipe. Only a slight impulse is there- fore required to trigger the flow of water. 2. As soon as the rotor reaches top speed the water is centrifugated against a fluted outer wall with enormous force. As it impacts a dense electrical force-field evolves, in which the wei ght of the water is neutralised. This electric charge can be increased by th e rotor's rate of rotation. The water rises, without being lifted, in the suction-pipe and passes into the whorl- pipes from the collector. The fall-weight is the impulse that enables the ducting off of surplus power. From time to time the water should be changed. The electric charge must al so be ducted away otherwise it can act as a brake in front of the nozzles. 3. A further gain in power results from the removal of frictional losses in the whorl-pipes. If the water is in-rolled through the special profile of the whorl-pipe, it is released from the pi pe-walls and forms a water plait like and inward-screwing water column. E xperiments of this nature were carried out under Viktor Schauberger's direction at the Technical University of Stuttgart. 6 4. Due to the rapid rotation of the roto r, centrifugal forces arise. The acceler- ated water in the whorl-pipes is thrust against the fluted outer wall of the machine. The ends of the whorl-pipes are curved in the opposite direction to the actual direction of rotation. A r ecoil is created similar to that in the abundance-producing wheel. This recoil develops energies similar to those in tornadoes. It should be mentioned that cooling takes place during the densation process in the whorl-pip es, and the 'cool eye' of the water- tornado sucks up water as tornad oes do cars, houses and locomotives. 7 Aloys Kokaly, Implosion Magazine, No. 57, pp 28-30 6 See Popel Report and Preamble on p. 219 of this book. — Ed. 7 In a letter Viktor Schauberger wrote that every tornado would collapse into itself, if one could manage to warm up its 'cold eye', i.e. the ti p of th e tornado.

For the generation of free energy in any quantity, whereby the water used to fill it is converted into noble water. 2. As a generator for the achievement of manifold increase in growth. If embedded in the ground, the energetically charged water radiates growth-enhancing forces down into the earth. 3. For obtaining individually constituted noble waters, which charge up the body cells, dissolve deposits and reduce inflammation. 4. For the propulsion of aircraft, which can never malfunction and crash. The great difficulty thus far was the manufacture of the whorl-pipes them- selves and the dynamic balancing of the rotor for the necessarily high rate of rotation. The machine consists of a cylindrical pi pe (see figs. 20 & 21), whose diameter and wall strength must be suited to the desired performance. The bottom plate, which also has a stable base f itted, is welded or riveted onto the cylinder. The plate carrying the motor, the dynamo and the whorl-pipe rotor is fixed to the top end of the cylinder with angle brackets. All three components rotate on a single, common axle. Because the carrying plate is mounted on rubber vibration pads, the axle takes up all the vibration and permits both high and highest rotational speeds. The rotor itself is hollow and houses the real heart of the machine. In the upper part of this hollow body a hub is attached from which the whorl-pipes pr oject. This hub is an enclosed hollow form. It is attached to th e rotor and turns with it. On its underside there is a opening for the intake of the suction-pipe . It extends deep into the lower part of the machine where the drive-water is present. The whorl-pipes are conical and various t ypes of jet-nozzles can be fitted to the ends (see figs. 29a & 29b) The tips of these nozzles are turned towards the direction of rotation. Opposite the exit openings and attached to the periphery of the cylinder, a harmonica-like sheet-metal band is attached. It is against this that the water jets are impelled at a wide angle. The rotor is then forced to move in the direction of rotation through the re sulting recoil and is thus set in rotation. As soon as the motor has set the genera tor and rotor in motion, the air or water will be sucked up the suction or rising pipe and into the rotor hub and centrifugated down the whorl-pipes. A v acuum is thereby created, which lifts the drive-water like any pump. The centrifugally impelled water, on impact with the sidewalls, would begin to flow in a circular path and all the water would remain at the outer wall. To prevent this, radial baffles mu st be installed to calm the water and conduct it back to the suction-pipe. 8 Either as a Repulsator or a Repulsine. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Early Developments in Implosion Machines 133 The Water-driven Implosion Machine (design principle) This machine produces additional torque, whic h relieves the load on the electric drive- motor and drives the generator.

These have an egg-shaped cross-section, narrowing c onically towards their ends and which have an impressed indentation over thei r whole length, by means of which the 'in-rolling' of air or water is enabled {see fig. 18). The narrowing of the cross-section occurs harmonically (proportionally), the exit nozzles can be of any size and the pipes of any length. In the implosion machine, several pipes are mounted on a conical rotor and radiate outwards from a common inlet. Through the rotor's rotation, the medium in the pipes (water or air) is subjected to centrifugal acceleration, r esulting in its split-second in-rollment, which leads to its cooling and densation. Through the discharge of this condensed and twisted water-plait, powe rful repulsive forces are generated, if the water-plait is centrifugated agains t the fluted outer walls. This recoil is the driving force. The principle involved in this process is that, due to the cooling during the reduction process, the oxygen becomes bound by the fuel (water or air) in the implosion machine, which produces a reduction in volume. The water and air then sink resistancelessly into the resulta nt suction. This implosive process is the exact opposite of explosion, today utilised everywhere. Aloys Kokaly, Implosion Magazine, No. 83, p. 15. In this machine an additional rotati onal force is created, which reduces the load on the electric drive-motor and driv es the generator. Since the generator produces more power than the drive-moto r requires, the drive-motor can be powered by the generator. According to Schauberger's concepts, the generator ought to produce ten times more power than the drive-motor needs. In other words, there should be a nine-fold surplu s of electric current. This occurs due to the fact that in specially constr ucted and (copper) alloyed devices protect- ed by patents (inverted propellers - whor l-pipes), ordinary air is caused to move above the speed of sound almost silently and virtually without cost. This results in the total collapse of the st ructure of the air, leading to a so far unknown energy-form, and through this, to any desired intensifiable form of heat or cold, or it is possible in this way, with the aid of the above form of energy, to generate silent, fire-less, mechanical power.

(c) The procurement of the secondary ra diation of energetic essences from involuted (inwinding) whorl-pipes c onstructed with bipolar alloys. These generate suction-vortices in the moving mass, whose narrow ends projects downwards. Upwardly whir ling pressure-vortices then evolve, which flow back into the suction-vortex. It is a metabolic cycle moving in cycloid-spiral-space-curves in an endless screw-form motion. Expressed even more clearly, it is a motion within and about itself. Once again it is to be stressed that all this has to take place in a geospheric environment. This first results in a c ondition of indifference, in a transitional state from which what is to be regenerated can be raised one stage higher in the process of synthesis. A preponderance of bases is created, which restores the over-acidified and the regenerated to a state of health. As a result, they can then reproduce and upwardly evolve with their own forces and energies, i.e. increase and ennoble themselves. The products of this implosive process have no spacial magnitude and thus create a biological vacuum in the fermentation vessel. A biological vacuum is the function of a mass of earth, water or air having a predominantly magnet- ic charge. It is the metaphysical ur-force of life. This primordial, yet new form of life, which overcomes all physical weight and mental inertia, can be produced for virtually nothing in every natural- esquely designed and alloyed liquid-manure pit within a week. 9 When these energies ascending autonomously from th e vegetation intermix with direct rays of light and heat, they coalesce into further physical growth. Viktor Schauberger, Implosi on Magazine, No. 45, pp 6-7 In Nature everything is reversible. If a metabolic interaction is triggered off implosively, it produces the relatively highest-grade upsuctional forces (levita- tion), which alleviate all mental torpor and negate all physical weight, as they also do in the case of the stationary trout. This can all be achieved with th e implosion-machine, which unwinds, rewinds and converts excess atmospheric pressure into a concentrative negative pressure. With these naturally engineered differences in potential it is possible not only to produce the dr iving forces for all growth, but also for powering these properly constructe d, alloyed and insulated machines. 9 See figs. 10 & 12 in The Fertile Earth, Vol. III of the Ecotechnology series. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Early Developments in Implosion Machines 137 themselves almost free of cost. These implosion-machines can also generate those energies on a large scale that come into being when we breathe, the result of which is etherealised food. Viktor Schauberger, Implosi on Magazine, No. 57, p. 5. In this case biomagnetism, the attrac ting and indrawing breathing force, evolves by up to 90%. It supplies the life-motor as well as the implosion- machine with atomic suctional and pr essural forces of the relatively highest efficiency. The 90% concentrative reactive forces serve creation and growth. The remaining 10% of decentrative surplus en ergies serve to expel waste and faecal matter, which in this process of reduction and purification, must quickly be ejected in order to prevent self-toxification. Viktor Schauberger, Implosi on Magazine, No. 56, p. 30. All power-generating machines, regardl ess of the system with which they operate, must conform to this principle: Useful energy can only be obtained from a system, if the mach ine triggers off a change in the temperature of the through- flowing substance. Started by an impulse-giving motor, the implosion machine sucks in the surounding air and water masses and reverses their polarity through a tangential, predominantly radial->axial, in-winding motion. In this way the diamagnetic, negative pressure comes into being. It is this negative pressure, that forces us to inhale positively supercharged air. This negative pressure produces a drop in temperature, resulting in the densation of the introduced water or ai r masses, which in turn results in a significant reduction in volume. This acts so strongly that, for example, the inducted air is transformed into water. The process is induced through the special shape of the spiral suction device, in which the through-flowing material is accelerated towards the bo ttom, in which process the special alloy also plays a role. The indrawn water- masses instantaneously attain the anom- aly point of +4°C (39.2°F). They beco me specifically densified. Homogenised by the spiral suction systems, the th rough-flowing material separates itself from the walls of the whorl-pipe. Through the intensification of the inwind- ing force and the simultaneous narrowing of the flow-through profile, the contents will be accelerated to such a degree, that the water or the air is screwed together into an almost homogenous jet and shoots out of the special system of nozzles as if from a gun. The through-flowing material attains an intrinsic velocity of 1,290 metres (4,232 ft ) per second. This is about four times the speed of sound. The discharge opening has a diameter of 1 mm (0.04 in.). This jet of water or air is as solid and as hard as steel wire, and is braked periodically by means of fixed, flat (angled) resistances, which results in a reactive recoil in the direction of the turbine's rotation. With a 1 mm (0.0394"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"138 The Energy Evolution in.) diameter jet outlet, energy is produced in the order of 17.9 horse power (hp) per jet, which maintains the turbine at 1,200 revolutions per minute (rpm). Every nozzle has 2 or 4 exit openings and in one system up to 100 nozzles are possible. If each opening discharges 1 litre (0.264 gal) of water - within a fraction of a second - in the opposite direction to the ab ove direction of braking, then atomic repulsive forces become free and active. With a total quantity of 10 litres (2.64 gal) of water, which circulates in this system with- out any resistance in cycloid spiral sp ace-curves at supersonic speeds, then forces of almost astronomical power beco me active. If the air is liquefied, then the efficiency is considerably increase d, because the reduc tion in volume is even greater than with the densation of water. The difference in potential increases with the number of rpm. By altering the rpm, the output can be changed significantly. For example, in order to achieve an output of between 50 and 100 hp, a turbine measuring 60 cm x 60 cm (24 in x 24 in) with a total weight of 30 kg - 50 kg (66 lbs - 110 lbs) and a rotational rate of 1,200 rpm would be required. For this neither pressure gradient nor pressure pipe is nec- essary. The turbine extracts its driving water from the surrounding air itself. Since the effective output increases with an increasing rate of rotation, which in addition necessitates an en larged radius, all that is needed is to increase the starting velocity in order to produce upwards of 1,000 hp from a turbine nor- mally producing 100 hp. Letter to Prof. Dr. h.c. Werner Zimmermann circa 1950, Viktor Schauberger, Implosion Magazine, No. 56, p. 4. If water or air are moved centripetally, i. e. radially->axially, then not only is there no resistance, but th e output increases by the square of the velocity. Viktor Schauberger, Implosion Magazine, No. 83, p. 15 In his theories, Viktor Schauberger proceeds on the basis that the spiral- shaped suction whorl-pipe itself can generate any amount of energy auto- matically. The implosion machine is supposed to generate so-called 'diamag- netism', and in this way is simultaneously stimulated into a sort of 'breathing', through which its uninterrupted operation is achieved. A. Khammas, Implosion Magazine, No. 83, p. 15. Schauberger applied this perception to all his deliberations and conceived flying discs, submarines, gas purifying and energy-generating systems. The component of his bio-technical submarine (see fig. 22) consisted of bundled 'whorl-pipes', which narrowed and in-rolle d the water, the combined effect of which produced a powerful repulsive vortex. What made Schauberger's principle so problematic, was 'the skill' of finding those curves wherein the water separa ted itself from its conducting walls,"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Early Developments in Implosion Machines 139 Probably the first sketch showing the design principle for a biotechnical submarine powered by a trout turbine (undated) The Bio-techncial Submarine (Design principle) Fig. 22: Bio-technical submarine"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"140 The Energy Evolution thereby becoming increasingly dense, but without any resistance, centri- petalised and thereby cooled. During this process the moving water evolves into a 'suction piston', resulting in an increasing densation from winding to winding, which proves the energetic function of the spiral. The spiral is hence the symbol of increasing force, and also the centre-piece of any machine that functions according to bio-logical laws. Professor Ehrenhaft is said to have calculated that on average implosive forces were 127 times more powerful than explosive forces. Aloys Kokaly, Implosion Magazine, No. 83, p. 14. If water or air is moved centripetally from outside inwards, i.e. radially->axially, no resistance evolves, but the performance increases by the square of the velocity, resulting in a peaceful transformation of the atom without explosion and therefore to a refinement, a process of formation and no destruction. In this way it is possible to prove not only mathematically, but practically, that a small implosion machine with a diameter of 20 cm (8 in) and rotating at 10,000 rpm, can lift 57 tonnes, and at 20,000 rpm, 228 tonnes. Normally, however, one would use smaller rotational forces and enlarge the radius. Leopold Brandstatter, Implosion Magazine, No. 60, p. 23. The  Space-Energy  Turbine  Water-powered space-energy generator Leonstein, August 1945 (Schauberger Archives) The space-energy turbine is not a turb ine in the conventional sense, which merely produces mechanical torque by exploiting the water's momentum arising from its head of pressure. Rather, it is a bio-dynamo (see figs. 30->33), which generates a hitherto unknown synthesising current, to differentiate from the cavitating, analysing current that now and then manifests itself in high-speed hydro-turbines and destroys even st eel turbine blades within a short time. The peak performance of the latter type of current corresponds to a pressure of 32,000 atmospheres. We are therefor e here concerned with hitherto un- researched reactive elements with cap acities far greater than those developed in conventional hydro-turbines through the forces arising from the water's mass-momentum. The types of current first mentioned arise from the bio-centrifugated inner constituents of water or air and are therefore space-energies. These are freed, for example, when high-grade (metal and/or quartz bearing) pebbles rub against one another, or manifest themselves as strong light effects in vacuum tubes, when a drop of water free-falls in an appropriate apparatus. These"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Early Developments in Implosion Machines 141 energies can act destructively or creatively and can be produced almost with- out cost and developed to any desired magnitude by means of mechanical impulsive forces derived, for example, from the mass-momenta of water in miniature machines. The purpose of this practically exploita ble atomic transformation, which is what concerns us here, is to set free the inner energies that dwell within the bodies (space-lattices) of water and air, a nd to apply them indirectly towards the generation of reactive temperatures or physical motive forces. In terms of the practical exploitati on of this synthesising current, which arises through the bio-centrifugence of water or air masses, we are here concerned with the peak performances of reactive suctional or pressural forces, whose generation makes use of minimal mass-momenta of water or air in order to achieve a many thousand-fold increase in capacity in comparison with contemporary methods of power production. Apart from their cheap- ness, these energies also foster natura l development. In terms of the way power is presently produced, today's t echnology is therefore founded on an unnatural basis and because of this, increasingly disastrous economic reces- sions must inevitably occur, the broader the scope of this totally unnatural method of generating energy. In other words, this must happen due to the extent to which the intensity of this development-inhibiting and expensive system of power production is magnified in wrongly designed and constructed apparatuses and through equally unnatural forms of motion. Apart from a rather uninteresting rotary m echanical effect applied directly to turbine propulsion, which can result in the immediate or subsequent appear- ance of the cavitating current (this can al so attack or demolish the banks in the vicinity of the discharge from such tu rbines), today's turbines also rapidly discharge the groundwater. In short, the intensity of their power constantly increases, thus provoking an almost unstoppable economic collapse. Space-energy turbines only make use of the physical momentum of the water as an impulsive force to enable the space-energies contained in these liquid dynagen concentrations to become free and active. How this happens in prac- tice is that, through centripetal inwinding (im-pulsive) processes, which are immediately followed by centrifugal outwinding (ex-pulsive) processes, flow- through velocities are achieved, which ha ve never before been attained. These far exceed the speed of sound and result in the total collapse of the aqueous flow-through substance, leading to pro cesses of atomic formation and trans- formation, which evolve on a comm on longitudinal developmental axis. This involves an upflowing bio-magnetic current with formative and levitative functions. It is thus a mean s of enhancing the whole spectrum of growth and increasing the upwardly impelling (levitative) force associated with it. In other words, it is the mean s to foster the evolution and increase of the 'ur-powerfully creative' motive force and to intensify its power to such a"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"142 The Energy Evolution degree that free and independent move ment can be achieved on land, on and under water and in the air at any desired speed virtually free of cost.

Wires are arranged around the outer periphery, which are cross-connected. They become charged with the animal- istic currents emanating from the water and conduct them to an electroscope (see fig. 23 & figs. 1->3). 1 One litre of water has to pass through this apparatus about 150 times before the flapping of the electroscope's foils weakens. Neon tubes glow with a rich, dark red initially, only to become brighter and brighter until the water begins to die and the light finally flickers and goes out. Consequently we imbibe hundreds of thousands of volts when we drink this healthy water, which can in no way be differentiated from a high-grade mountain-springwater. It was in this way that I discovered how to transform stale stream-water, rainwater or dis tilled water into high-quality drinking water. The process is very simple. A little light, a little darkness, a little heat and a little cold, rhythmically sequenced, is e nough to charge the vilest water with high quality as it flows through the mutators, a process that could also perhaps be described as 'ionisation'. To this I add the elements that chemical analysis has shown to be deficient, but which are present in all springwater and therefore the waters of any given spring, even the most famous spa-waters, can easily be emulated just as Nature does it. In this regard a cubic metre of water (35.315 ft 3 ) only costs about 10-12 Austrian grosschen and the apparatus itself about 100 schillings if mass-produced. Therefore anyone can install their own spa or mountain spring in their attic at very little cost. The essential nature of this concerns th e achievement of an absolute solu- tion and the freeing of the energies concentrated in the metals and minerals by means of a cold process of combustion. By virtue of this, all substances are dissolved, or expressed more accurately , fall out of the mother-stone or mother-metal in the form of freed ener gies, which can be incorporated into the water without undergoing any change. To achieve this, the water must be brought down to a temperature of +4°C (+39.2°F) in darkness, which takes place in interconnected mixing vessels through indirect oxygen pressures. The added salts are of such minimal qua ntity that it is inconceivable to anyone that effects of such a kind can be produced. An essential aspect in this regard are the solutions of the meta llic substances, which are accumulated in the water and thus in the simplest way these contrasting metals are 1 This also relates to the effects of Lord Kelvin's influence machine ca. 1880. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Ennoblement of Water 145 Schematic Arrangement of the Nuremberg Water-Jet Experiment- 1938 This was set up to determine the charge in falling water as well as water quality.

In later consequence these processes of ur-generation cause the cancerous decay of the tissues, because the calcar eous basic elements are missing, which as mentioned earlier, are precisely those which as a result of vacuum-like phenomena, enable the maintenance of cool blood. The best evidence for this we find in shade-demanding timbers over-exposed to light, which as a result of the intrusions of modern forestry , leads to organic disturbances and to cancerous symptoms of decay in the hi gh forest, as is also the case with humans and animals. The same thing we find in all other species of vege- tation, where the same symptoms can be detected everywhere. In consort with technologists, our doc tors have overlooked the fact that fertilising substances come from above and that the substances to be fertilised come from below. Energy is released at the point of intersection of both ray- pathways, which generates cold light or what we call life. My aim was to obtain the energy-rays only by their release from the various energy-concentrations (elements) and to precipitate the leached waste matter. In this very simple way I succeeded in binding only the noblest substances in the water and in sparing the human body the function of a sludge-sack. The first logical result was the purging of the organism, because the highly active water even dissolves crystalline accretions and flushes them from the body. The second logical outcome was the high-grade organic transformation of emanations and therewith the synthesis of those high-grade thoughts with which all other natural processes can be comprehended. The main point, however, is that no high-quality ideas can emerge from a messy sludge-sack and therefore it is no wonder that humanity is not only putrefying healthwise, but also morally. Mutilation of the mind is a further logical result of contemporary deductive methods and even here too, out- siders must dare to venture in order to make the specialists and experts aware of ur-simple, natural phenomena. No process is of one-sided nature. All progress also involves wastage. The wast e material produced by the formu- lation of thoughts are seeds. Therefore with their present view of life, people will not only become mentally impotent, but sexually impotent too.

The binding of ur-substances in water brings about a harmonious state of equilibrium in every organism. Letter to Dr W. Busselberg From Implosion Magazine, No. 71, written in Nuremberg 18-24/11/1937. Dear Dr Busselberg, In the periodical TAU you will see the treatise on water resources manage- ment. 4 Your desire for further articles I am unable to satisfy, because these writings have been suppressed everywhere. I have only one copy of each, and in any case they are all in Vienna. The publication or the manuscripts concerning the decomposition of drink- ing water, domestic water, blood, and the cause of cancer are so alarming that it is unwise to speak of them here in Germany. The whole secret of all scourges is to be ascribed to over-oxygenated water - water that has been treated with chlorine, quartz lamps, or subjected to oligodynamic processes. When combined with anodic substances (artificial fertilisers), such water pro- duces bacteria in a very short time. I have furnished doctors with evidence and set down the necessary interrelations in writing, because nobody has dared to publish the true causes, otherwise almost all drinking water supply- pipes would have to be rebuilt. Equall y inevitable would be the prohibition of the fertiliser industry by law. In other areas of industry drastic changes will also have to take place. For this reas on there will hardly be any possibility to discuss this openly in the foreseeable future. My discoveries are so far-reaching, that everybody would be reduced to a state of terror. I have therefore no other choice, but to bide my time and continue my research eventually to be able to provide information and advice, when those in authority no longer see any other way out. In my estimation this moment will already come early next year. I am ready at any time to furnish free information, proo fs and means of assistance to competent persons. Naturally in doing so I cannot afford any large outlays, because as a foreigner I have none or only a few marks to my name. These are just suffi- cient to allow me to finish the work I started here. In any event, I have to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to listen to what I have to say. When I find such individuals, then it will be possible to provide effective assistance. If not, then there will be much vexation. At the moment I am building an apparatus with which I will demonstrate the processes of growth and in particular, the enormous importance of the 4 See series of articles on r i v e r engineering written by Viktor Schauberger for 'DieWasserwirtschaft', the Austrian Journal of Hydrology, which appear in The Wa ter Wizard, Vol. I of the Ecotechnology series. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"148 The Energy Evolution, growth-zones in the Earth. Moreover, I w ill provide proof that the cause of all cancerous diseases is due to the direct influences of atmospheric oxygen. Atmospheric organisms can only obtain oxygen by way of diffusion (indi- rectly by passing through another medi um), otherwise pressure, combustion, inflammation of the tissues, blood- , water- or sap-decomposition ensues. Bacteria are only of secondary importan ce. Every type of blood, water and sap has its own individual bacteria. In Na ture there are indeed similarities, but no identicalities, for in Nature there is no state of equilibrium. Water is not H 2 O, but the first substance arising from the harmonious inter- action between plus and minus (quantity and quality). The ur-cause of natural motion is the interchange of substan ce (metabolism). Whoever causes sub- stance to move without taking the metabolism into account will also have to accept the associated resistances to motion. A motion triggered through metabolic processes is natural and therefore resistance-less. Here too we stand before an upheaval with technological ramifications. The associated proofs, apparatuses, etc. are now complete. Present practices in land, forest, water and energy resources management are absolutely wrong. Germany stands before a catastrophe in the foreseeable future, because the water is disappear- ing and the groundwater is sinking. Atmospheric water has nothing whatever to do with geospheric water. The scarcity of rainwater is not the reason for the disappearance of springwater, because the latter is produced through geospheric metabolic processes. You must apply all your influence to this, for it concerns the fate of Germany. I stand completely behind my assertions and can prove all that is stated above. I honestly mean what I say and have the best of intentions. I know Nature and her secrets, more pe rhaps than any other person alive. Blood & Sap Circulation as a Model for the Ennoblement of Water Leonstein, 28th May 1945, - Implos ion Magazine, No. 124, pp 56-58. Up to now no-one has succeeded in discovering the origins of blood and sap circulation, or in explai ning the purpose of this metabolic cycle. The assertion that the heart is a blood-pump is in adequate for the si mple reason that the primary question still remains unanswered, namely, what forces keep the heart muscle pulsating? A trifling infection of the blood is enough to alter the heart's activity, to make the pulse-beat irregular and to disturb the state of health with feverish c onditions. For this reason alone it becomes clear that it is not the heart that mov es the blood, bul the blood that activates the heart."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The Ennoblement of Water 149 To understand this, the nature of the blood, the causes of its coming into being and the reason for its passing away must be examined more closely. The cause of its formation is 'cycloid -space-curve-motion', which is to be understood as inwardly and upwardly inwinding spiral cyclical motion. This is characterised by the fact that, with even the smallest impulses the substance rotates about its own axis, which gives rise to the rhythmical alternation between centrifugal and centripetal pulsations on a common developmental axis, resulting in the creation of an alte rnating current flow. This organic alter- nating current is the actual motivating force behind the movement of blood and the activity of the heart caused by such movement. An analogous proof of this is the emergence of pulsa tion in naturalesquely moved water. The heart is therefore a kind of compensating valve into which the dis- charged (venal) blood flows back and satiates itself with products of digestive processes. This mixture is then supplie d with fertilising substances (oxygen) through breathing; in other words, the fo rmer consumes (binds) the latter. The products of the repulsive further move ment of the blood are conformations that have been developed to the i mmediately higher aetheric and energetic state. Due in part to the influences of heat and diffuse light, these agglomerate as new blood masses and subsequently solid ify into the physical substances of growth. It is out of these secondary products of synthesis that the build-up of primary synthesising substances takes place, namely, forms of energy which interact with the surrounding potentials and in this way generate the body's physical energies - its capacity to carry its own weight and its ability to move. In principle it is the same process that can be observed in all plants, where the root-protoplasm is the source of negative potential through which fertilis- ing interactions with positively charge d atmospheric substances occur. Again, through the direct influences of light and heat, this leads to the inner con- densing of the lower-grade products of these interactions and therefore to the layer-by-layer formation of the solid forms of plant bodies - in other words, to physical growth. The motion arising from physical impulses therefore leads to metaphysical formative motion, and in further consequence to an increase in performance. Provided the appropriate temperature influences, namely the oligodynamic (dissociative) and catalytic (formative) ancillary influences, can take effect, then a small impulse triggered off in a naturalesquely contoured and alloyed vessel will suffice to enable droppable 5 liquid or gaseous mixtures to be trans- formed and built up into the next highest state of evolvement (aetheric and energetic forms). On their part, these are responsible for further processes of reproduction and development, the in crease in physical substance and the enhancement of metaphysical qualities. 5 D r o p p a b l e : refers to liquids or gases capable of agglomerating into dr ops when falling. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"150 The Energy Evolution In principle the same transformative and formative processes take place in the human and animal organism. These stimulate respiration which in turn provides for the supply of fertilising substances, and once again the next higher products of development, aether ic and energetic, are created, which are the actual source of energy for the physical and metaphysical motive forces. It is upon this finding that the ennoblement of the blood of the Earth - the negatively charged groundwater - is founded. This cannot only be produced in unlimited quantity, but also increased and qualitatively ennobled, provided the developmental processes described above are copied naturalesquely. Once again, the true secret of evolution lies in the cycloid motive impulse triggered off in naturalesquely formed vessels - extreme egg-shapes. Following from the above, it is obvious that the proper proportion in the mixture between the substances of the Earth and the Sun (carbones and oxygenes) is also decisive. This system of blood and sap circul ation, faithfully copied from nature, enabled the high priests of bygone cultures to produce artificial high-springs in which water rose exuberantly to the highest mountain peaks, where the sacred groves were to be found. In these groves the holy or healing water gushed forth - the higher up it discharged, the greater its wholesomeness. The lengthening of the developmental path along the longitudinal axis was one of the most closely guarded secrets of the nature-attuned high priests, who were regarded by the populace as miracle-workers. They increased the growth of high quality cereals and fruits and enhanced harvest yields simply by moving water rhythmically about the transverse and longitudinal axis and about its own axis cycloidally in na turalesque development-facilitating vessels under the exclusion of light and heat. Moreover, they knew the recipes for the mixtures, which similar to those in human or animal bodies, are the products of inorganic digestion. As in wardly and outwardly oscillating form- ative essences arising from the 'cycloid movement of the Earth-masses', these products are respirated and supplied with fertilising substances (oxygen) on their formative path and explain the profound secret of genesis and growth, as well as the latter's ennoblement. In this way it is therefore possible not only to produce large quantities of water, but also to ennoble it. Therefore the possibility now exists not only to transform seawater into drinking and domestic water at an atomic level, but also to establish new and almost limitless cultural communities even in waterless wastelands. That 'spe- cific' healing is also possible with this noble water will be addressed in another chapter and explained in greater detail. The devices for demonstrating these processes are located at the moment at Rudolf Zeitlinger's scythe factory.

Petrol (Gasoline) From Water From Spec. Ed. of Mensch und Technik, Vol. 2, 1993, Section 9.0 (Notes from January 1936). Take a well-insulated, preferably egg- shaped vessel made of clay or failing this, an oak-barrel, which as far as possible shields against the influences of external temperatures, but which neither impedes the respiration of the vessel, nor disturbs its diffusive functions. A three-element jet-impeller is rotated (screwed into the water) inside the vessel, the upper portion being made of copper and the lower of a metal of opposite polarity, such as silver. The openings themselves must of as small a bore as possible and of a screw- form configuration, so that on the one hand the mechanical coherence of the gases forced through under the highest practicable pressure is guaranteed and on the other, a very strong atomis ation takes place, when the gas exiting from the lower nozzle enters the upward -curving egg-profile under a strong drop in temperature. The surfaces of the systems of jet-nozzles are reciprocally configured dimensionally. The three nozzle-openings narrow towards the exit-opening in the same ratio. 6 The lower series of nozzles is half the size of the upper. Immediately above and below the two thrust-pro ducing elements, which must be well-insulated externally, adjustable thrust deflectors are mounted inside the egg-form, which can be set closer together or further apart in order to be able to regulate the evolving differences in potential. These thrust-emitters are also to be insu lated externally, so that the direction of their respective electrons is safeguard ed. They must also be made of bi- polar metals; the simplest solution being to silver-plate the copper elements or to put a layer of copper-oxide on the silver components. 7 The most essential aspect in this regard is that these elements begin to emit rays under the reciprocal influence of temperature and that an animalistic current flows. This ionisation, wherein hydrolysis 8 plays a decisive role by means of high-tension and complex absorptive processes, is of crucial importance for it is during these processes that the analysing and synthesis- ing electro-osmotic events have to take place. 6 The ratio here is probably that of the 'Golde n Mean' or 'Fibonacci ratio' = 1 :1.618033988. — Ed. 7 This appears to describe an early model of the Repulsator for which there are no accompanying diagrams.    —    Ed.    8 Hydrolysis signifies the decomposition of a substan ce by the combination of one of its elements with one of those in water. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"152 The Energy Evolution The barrel or unglazed, earthenware vessel 9 , which should be as egg-shaped as possible, will now be filled with well- insolated seawater or thoroughly inso- lated or acidified fresh water, preferably rainwater. The successful outcome depends on the degree of solar irradiation and acidification. Lack of sunshine can be remedied by the addition of hydrogen peroxide, etc., but this does necessitate irradiation with a quartz lamp. The simplest is solar irradiation. The starting temperature of the water should be between +12°C (+53.6°F) and +17°C (+62.6°F). Into this insolated water very small quantities of silver or zinc, or copper filings should now be added. Eventually these can also be applied to the nozzle lining and around which the entering gas will flow. In this case, the particles or laminates must be sma ll enough not to block the nozzle-openings. The relative proportions between these tw o metals of contrasting polarity has to be determined empirically. In addition small quantities of brown-coal in the form of cubes, phosphates of salt, a little magnesium or other sub- stances, such as can be found in all springwater, must be introduced into the water. These salts, however, should not ha ve been overly exposed to daylight. As additives, sulphurated water and th e addition of a little nitrate of potash increase the performance of the end pro duct. The more varied the additives, the better and the higher th e quality of the final mixture. Because the chang- ing seasons often have a decisive effect on the whole, the relative proportions of these additives must also be determined empirically. Once all this has been done, the vessel is then closed and sealed against the entry of light and air. Then a dash of carbon-dioxide and a dash of air or oxygen are introduced alternately, the former from above and the latter from below, but in such a way that no pr essure is created in the interior. The C-acid gas 10 introduced from above lowers its temperature and will be rapidly absorbed by the cooling water. Once this ionised gas mixture has been inhaled by the water, as it were, then a dash of oxygen is injected, whose dispersal must be confined within the water only, concentrating itself in the upper strata of the water. This results the development of a stratified, self- densifying, spacial structure from the bottom upwards, through which the carbone gases coming from above have to diffuse. If the process proceeds 9 This shape is akin to the gulla, which Viktor Schauberger describes as follows: \"The people of ancient cultures made use of the so-called 'gulla' for stor ing their liquids. This mysterious vessel maintains the freshness and vitality of every li quid, be it water, milk, etc. Fabr icated under very curious ritual- istic practices, the gulla was formed out of clay w ith a high aluminium content The basic shape of the gulla was the pentagon, the ur-form into which the lump of clay was shaped before being turned on the potting wheel into the naturales quely shaped vessel. If such a basic clay form is stood on its natural base, then the naturalesque egg-shape is creat ed, in which the bi-fifth triangle plays a decisive role in respect to its hypotenuse and side in rela tion to the radius, whereby the rpm of the wheel and the resistance to oscillation of the shaping hand has also to be taken into co nsideration. The function of the finished vessel, with which it is known the ancients cooled luke-warm water in hot sand under the rays of the midday Sun, depends on the skill applie d to these internal and external influences as the naturalesque egg-shape was rotating.\" Implosion Magazine, No. 115, pp 62-63. — Ed. 10 C-acid gas: Carbonic acid gas othe rwise known as carbon-dioxide. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The Ennoblement of Water 153 correctly, then an extremely strong vacuum forms in the space above the water, which atomises and cools the follow-up CO 2 even more, giving rise to the necessary intensification on the on e hand and the creation of the polarity between the gas and the water on the other. Under this reciprocal intensification th e introduced substances begin to dis- sociate, during which process the water temperature slowly drops to +4°C (39.2°F). This temperature level must be maintained by injecting the gases alter- nately during which the pressure-gauge fl uctuates slightly. This is a sign that the water has begun to breathe and pul sate properly. Should over-pressure occur, it is indicative of a progressive development of heat, whereas an under- pressure signifies a strong increase in CO 2 . Here the danger of an explosion is incipient, which can be averted if the temperature of the water can be main- tained at +4°C (+39.2°F). This can be re gulated simply by adjusting the inflow of oxygen. The addition of very small quantities of oil or other fatty-matter increases the valence of the mixture, but also the danger of explosion. For this reason the introduction of these substances is not advisable at the beginning. If no reactions of any kind are evident, and if all the ingredients have been completely dissolved, then the mixture should be allowed to stand for about two hours, during which time the temperature must always be maintained at +4°C (+39.2°F). This is most easily achieved in a cellar where such temperatures prevail. Where a good cellar is available, however, the whole thing can be simplified, because the process described above need only be inaugurated with a few alternating injections of O and CO 2 . The whole can then be left to ferment, a process sufficiently well-understood in the preparation of wine or cider. In this instance, however, in th e initial stages of the process, the contents should be stirred around gently with a well-insulated mixing-device on which a zinc or silver scoop has been mounted on one side and a copper one on the other. The external closure can be effected with a mercury seal or by the insertion of a compression ring. The content of introduced CO 2 , however, must exceed 90% and proportions similar to those found in the water of all good mountain springs must exist in the end-mixture, although here we are concerned with substantially different products of solution than those found in springwater. In principle, however, there is no difference between them. In this regard it is necessary for those substances that have evolved under the influences of light to be decomposed in darkness and a drop in temperature or vice versa. Through these alternating processes of decomposition, structures of alternate character are formed by mutually opposing influences. This arising and passing away is triggered artificially and reciprocally intensif ied until a complete solution results, ultimately arriving at the synthesis intended. With warming and having undergone an end-reaction, the finished mixture has a slight smell of petrol, but does not burn. However, if this mixture is"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"154 The Energy Evolution atomised in a needle-jet or inject or and only lightly compressed by the descending piston, then an explosion o ccurs. We have thereby achieved what we wanted, namely a mixture of explosive water, which is an exceptionally stable and safe substance, but which produces a higher dynamic effect in the piston- engine than the product obtained through the distillation of crude oil we call 'petrol' (gasoline). Electromagnetic ignition is superfluous and by means of this process we have produced a substan ce that can be used in diesel-engines. For large-scale production, this mixture is best produced in special tubes, which cool and move the seawater bio- dynamically as it flows. In this way any desired quantity can be mass-produced. Since any kind of agricultural or forestry waste can be decomposed in these tubes, this process is by far the simplest and best, for no work of any ki nd is required. All that is necessary is for predigested waste-matter to be t horoughly and completely fermented in seawater or salinated fresh water durin g the self-cooling flowing motion. The addition of turnip slices, fruit-waste, le mon peel, etc., increases the valence of the mixture, because we are here concerned with a very simple natural process, which is essentially always the same, namely that everything that has once grown, that has lived and moved, pulsates, ferments and reconstitutes and builds itself up, if the thing is merely moved morphologically and the anomaly point or life-point is approached as a result. With every degree Celsius (1.8°F) drop in temperature, all gases cool at the expense of their volume and in this extr emely simple way the dematerialisation- volume, or the 4th dimension, or the condition of pure energy is ultimately reached. In this respect it is important to differentiate clearly between the spacial structure and the volumetric stru cture; that is to say, that neither formative entities, nor dematerialising entities should be allowed to appear, 11 if one wishes to accumulate positive or negative intensifications of energy in any given liquid. This takes place at th e anomaly point or point of neutrality, in which space and volume dematerialise and hence manifest themselves non-spacially as energy. 11 Here the word 'spacial' can also be taken to mean 'd imensional' in that here it is necessary to achieve an intermediate state of equilibrium at the ha lfway point between other-d imensionality and physical volume. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"9.

The Production and Advantages of Implosion Machines Linz, 27th March 1955, From Implosion Magazine, No. 61. he Suction-turbine (see fig. 20), generally known as an Implosion machine, is as different from a pressu re-turbine as night is from day. Both machines are reactors or devices which trigger off reactive forces. The suction-turbine is water-producing, whereas the pressure-turbine is water-destroying. The pressure-turbine utilises the forces resulting from the weight of water and its efficiency rises as the availabl e head of water or steam increases. The suction-turbine requires no head of pressure and therefore can be installed in still water. This saves expensive pressu re resistant pipes primarily because it sucks in its own drive-water. In order to do this, however, it has to be set it motion by conventional means. The higher the speed of the starter motor, the grater the quantity of drive-water screwed upwards and the higher the performance. The indrawn water becomes densified mechanically and phys- ically. The rotation of the many whorl-pipes generates centrifugal force along their longitudinal axes, which expresses itself as an evolving reactive force. The generation of these reactive, ro tational forces, and therefore the performance of the suction-turbine, is dependent on the initial velocity at which the mass of drive-water is su cked upwards, densified and accelerated. This can be regulated at will according to the setting of the starter motor, which merely provides the initial impulse for the frictionless, rotational acceleration.

Forces are active in the suction-turbine, which cannot be compared with those in a pressure-turbine. The suction-turbine is also a machine for ennobling water, in which polluted freshwater can be reactivated, or seawater reconverted into mountain-spring- quality drinking water and otherwise us eful water. Suction-turbines are therefore development-enhancing reactors. The output of the suction-turbine is about nine times greater than a pressure- turbine, because no resistance is created in its system of pipes. This eliminates all competition from the pressure-turbine industry. At school everyone learnt that the Earth has a magnetic longitudinal axis about which it rotates. In every physics book or even a dictionary it is stated that there is a form of magnetism which attracts iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese, etc. The counterpart to this form of magnetism is the organic vacuum, which draws in oxygen and supplies organic processes with it. Also known as diamagnetism, this form of magnetism evolves when a medium with a loose-knit structure, su ch as air or water, is moved in an inwinding motion about its own axis. This motion leads to the cooling and reduction of the volume. The reduction in spaciality is indicative of the initiation of the adsuctional or attractive effect. This axis is not like the shafts in all contemporary machines. The suction- turbine (implosion-machine) has no shaft, but only a hub onto which the log- arithmical 1 whorl-pipes are attached. It is an inverted (inside-out) propeller, which centripetates the indrawn masses of air or water about their own axis and therefore inwinds them radially->ax ially. They trigger off the mysterious negative pressure, which Professor Sauerbruch discovered in the thorax. In 1908 his superior, Professor Mikolitsch, declared that Professor Sauerbruch was out of his mind, when the latter asserted that without this negative pressure it would be impossible to breathe. Nor would any uptake of nutri- ents be possible. However, Professor Sauerbruch failed to appreciate that this concerned the development of diamagne tic, reactive forces, which evolve in the self-inwinding blood and sap vessels. New findings of research have indicated that the Earth rotates in spiral space-curves about its diamagnetic axis. This axis is no axle, but a negatively potentiated concentration of dynagen, which arises through this inwinding motion. The axis itself is something ak in to a hole into which seminal sub- stances are sucked. Had science percei ved this earlier, then the suffocating death of water would never have happened. It must also be mentioned in this regard, that over-illuminated and warmed water inevitably decays. 1 Logarithmical: Viktor also makes use of the 'Golde n Mean' or 'Fibonacci ratio' in the construction of such pipes and their graduated attenuation in the ratio 1:0.618033988. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Machines of the Genus — Repulsator 157 Every river regulation is a crime, because the water migrates towards the riverbank owing to the cessation of its complex, curvilinear, flow pattern.

The Production of Noble Water & Drinking Water An Assembly of Pertinent Data from Implosion Magazine The whole problem lies in the creation of breathing water using a technical appliance. First of all the water must actually be alive. For this it has to be made to in-roll and then out-roll again. If one wishes to achieve the desired potentiation of the noble water, then its previous potential must be eliminated. This happens by starting off with disti lled water into which the trace elements are introduced, that are to be found in certain medicinal springs. The starting temperature is about +20°C (+68°F) a nd the end temperature +4°C (+39.2°F). Aloys Kokaly, Implosion Magazine, No. 51, p. 12. If the temperature in the (springwater producing) apparatus reaches +4°C (39.2°F), the 'process of cold oxidation' is inaugurated, whereby the oxygen, which becomes passive in this condition, is bound or emulsified by the hydro- gen, which has become aggressive. Th e 'Eternally Feminine' winds the 'Masculine' into herself and allows herself to be fertilised. Viktor Schauberger, Implosion Magazine, No. 21, p. 5. For this purpose a little ice must be adde d. The apparatus holds about 11 litres (2.9 gal.) (see figs. 24-26) It is filled to the brim with water so that all air is excluded. It is then sealed, about 4 litres (1.06 gal) of carbon-dioxide impressed and about 4 litres of water drained. The appliance is then set in motion. The sucking function of the vortex evolving in the device, entrains the carbon-dioxide into the water very quickly and a vacuum develops. Under the effect of this vacuum, the various mineral and metallic trace ele- ments become incorporated in the wate r. With the drop in temperature from +17°C (+62.6°F) to +4°C (+39.2°F) th e oxygen becomes inactive, whereas the carbones and hydrogen become highly active.

The Treatment of Water in the Preparation of Noble Water 1. Before treatment the water must be boiled in order to remove any dirt and its intrinsic potential. For medical purposes, distilled water should always be used. Such water is then ready an d in an appropriate condition for use. 2. Into the opened, egg-shaped vessel, the desired additives are placed, such as cooking salt, silicon, calcium, etc., which were lost in the previous process. The addition of essential oils is also permitted. 3. At a water temperature of +17°C (+62.6°F), the vessel is to be filled to the brim to exclude all air. 4. The apparatus is then sealed and th e valve on the bottom opened. With the subsequent introduction of carbon- dioxide, 4 litres (1.06 gal) of water will be displaced from the bottom, so that 7 litres (1.85 gal) of water remain. The apparatus is then closed and checked for leak s, so that the evolving vacuum cannot be neutralised. 5. The device is then placed in a refrigerator, or may be wound with refrig- erating coils (see fig. 26) in an insu lated jacket, because the contents must be cooled to +4°C (39.2°F), in wh ich process the residual oxygen becomes passive. It is known that in every cooling process where temperatures reach +4°C (39.2°F) and below, no ox idation or rotting takes place. The now inactive oxygen will be bound (emu lsified) by the activated hydro- gen and carbon-dioxide. 6. Meanwhile the motor is switched on a nd the contents of water will be propelled upwards along a centrifugating spiral column. In a certain sense, this represents the breathing of the water. The water is moved by a motor-driven rotating concave copper disc. 7. In the upper half of the appara tus a rotating copper dome-shaped enclosure is incorporated. The rotating water will be pressed inwards by this and flows downwards in the form of an in-rolling spiral. The point of this vortex, similar to a tornado, lands on the lower rotating copper disc and the whole process begins anew. 8. The automatic control of the motor's alternating direction of rotation to right and left is intended to copy the right-hand<->left-hand curvilinear flow of water in natural, untouched watercourses, where the water will always swing from one side to the other.

An egg should be filled to the brim with springwater (under no circum- stances should it contain any chlorine) or aqua destillata or carbonated water (soda siphon water).

The two bottles are then shaken thoroughly for a few minutes until the water in both has become milky. The bottle containing the three sediments should be poured into the egg first, followed by the bottle containing calcium. The latter should be handled with care and should be stored in the dark. At first the water appears milky, but clears itself during the inwinding process. 3. Sufficient carbon-dioxide should then be introduced in order to expel the last traces of air. This is best done with a vacuum pump, whereby any desired quantity of carbon-dioxide can be admixed, or whose addition can thereby be regulated. Regulation is also possible with the reduction valve. The right quantity of carbon-dioxide can only be determined by experiment, which is possible by tasting the finished water. If the carbon- dioxide is noticeable, then too much has been added. If the water is too hard, then the amount of calcium is excessive. Whatever ingredient or sediment comes to the fore must be reduced in quantity. If the water is insufficiently refreshing, then th e magnesium should be increased. The mixture is correct if no sediment or carbon-dioxide is particularly notice- able in the water. If the water is insu fficiently invigorating, then there is not enough carbon-dioxide. 4. After the cover of the egg has been sealed, then it should be allowed to operate for about 3/4 of an hour. The best time to do this is before 9.00 am. During thunderstorms or immediately prior to them, attempts to produce good water are unsuccessful. All smelly, aromatic or odorous material should be removed from the vicinity of the egg, because the fermenting water attracts and absorbs all aromas, particularly those of onions, garlic, soap, etc. The vacuum must be allowed to develop slowly (about 300 rpm should suffice). Rapid vacuum deve lopment is unproductive and should be avoided. It is enough if 0.8 - 0.96 absolute atmospheres have been achieved by the end of the process. 5.

Cold and Hot Machines - Cooling-Heating Machines From Spec. Ed.

The breath-like regulation of oxygen between interconnected vessels (containing copper and zinc plates) is enough to eliminate thousands of heat- calories in a few seconds, or convert them into cold substances. These simple, natural processes are valid for temperature fluctuations in excess of 60°C (108°F). This involves the atomic dissociation of air or aqueous substances.

Central heating with reactive forms of heat In exactly the same way as happened afte r World War I, there is no other solu- tion to the present shortage of coal than to cut down the forest in order to heal our houses over the coming winter. As a result: 1. A valuable national asset will be further destroyed. 2. A whole string of new economic disasters will ensue. 3. Nothing will be achieved of any practical value. Assuming that we are able to fell such a large number of trees, then, as also happened after World War I, it will be impossible to transport the green and heavy fire-wood logs to the railways and on to further destinations, due to the lack of draft-animals and fuel. What is actually delivered, can barely be burned for at least six months, because firewood must first be dried out. At the same time the generation of an unhealthy form of heat, conducive to the propaga- tion of bacteria will result. People should send me a few sheets of copper (Cu), brass (Cu 5 Zn 8 , Cu 9 Al 4 , Cu 3 Sn 8 ) or aluminium (Al), which should be 0.8-1.0 mm (0.0315-0.0394 in.) thick. Steel sheet is hard to bend, alt hough it is also very suitable. It is not worth having a press-die specially made merely to build a prototype to demonstrate how this problem can be solved naturally and inexpensively. Hardly anyone will be able to unders tand the essential nature of this new system of heating. Nevertheless, the attempt should be made in order to create interest. It is a well-known fact that it is wa rm below the ground-surface in winter and cool in summer. These variations in temperature originate from material changes in the raw materials present in the ground and in part are are also effected through the 'cycloid-s piral-space-curve motion' of the Earth. These inter- nal and external changes in motion are brought about as Nature increases the intensity of the Sun's rays in summe r by lengthening their developmental path 2 and weakens them in winter through the earthward approach of the Sun at perihelion. In very general term s this enables dense agglomerations of 2 In the northern hemisphere summer the distance be tween Sun and Earth increases to a maximum at aphelion about the 1st of June. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Klimator 167 oxygen to enter the ground. It is the same process that happens in a motor in cool weather or at night. The oxygen then consumes the residual matter, which the Earth created during the summer out of the earthly remains of deceased life-forms with the aid of her cycloid-spiral-space-curve motion. The movement of sap in summer and its state of rest in winter are the bio- logical sequel to the above variations in intensity. These are the cause of the different motions, which in turn contri bute towards the intensification of the Earth's new processes. It is only in this way that qualigen is to be understood, whose waste-matter is also involved in the generation of reactive, falling and therefore concentrating influences of heat. Without these influences no growth is possible. It is these falling an d concentrating forms of heat that are of interest to us at the moment, since they can solve the most urgent problems of fuel and heating quickly and simply. They are about 90% more efficient than normal methods of heating for the simple reason that they are produced from the waste-products of qualigen and hence will function equally efficiently in large, medium or very small heating appliances. A great deal of time, effort and expe nse can thus be spared using this naturalesque method of heating. Wood and coal will become as good as obso- lete. In Nature nothing happens direc tly, but only indirectly. Without waste- matter, therefore, no growth and no gain is possible. As far as present heating problems are concerned, the trick is to learn how to make use of those waste- products that generate fa lling and concentrating heat rays. These heat from above downwards in the same way that the Sun heats the surface of the Earth. For this purpose a Klimator is required. Wh at is a Klimator? It is merely a type of dynamo that generates natural forms of temperature, or more accurately, falling and concentrating heat rays as well as naturally rising and expanding forms of cold. The latter are health -promoting and lethal to bacteria. The Klimator essentially consists of three special components (see fig. 28) and: 1. Is a small, conventional heating el ement, which is incorporated in the middle of a sort of selenium cell 3 , which is surrounded by a material mass. As in a natural living cell (similar to a protoplasm), all major and secondary basic elements are present in an allotropic state. Herein are contained all stocks of allotropic fructigens and seminal substances, oligodynamic (decay-promoting) and catalytic (g rowth-accelerating), exciting sub- stances. 2. Is a diminutive, but faithful copy of the Earth itself, within which an agi- tator rotates, which is attached to the end of the vertical shaft. In addition, 3 Selenium's electrical resi stance increases with exposure to light and a selenium cell is a type of photo- electric cell comprising a thin coating of selenium a pplied to a metal disc and covered with a layer of gold or platinum thin enough to allow the passage of light. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"168 The Energy Evolutio the Klimator consists of a series of nested, rilled, calyx-like 4 vanes, which are so constructed that the through-fl owing masses, such as water and air, can be bio-centrifugated. Through th e increase in centripetating and cen- trifugating velocities, which have hith erto never been achieved anywhere, increases in pressure and suction are produced, which reciprocally amplify each other exponentially. This results in the decomposition of the water and air due to the thorough trituration of the smallest molecules of sediment, leading to the development of a h itherto unknown process of synthesis. This gives rise to two longitudinally oriented types of inward flowing, spiral-like currents, one flowing upwards and the other downwards. 3. A small generator is also incorporat ed in the Klimator, whose armature is fixed and about which the stator rotates. Fig. 28: The Klimator The primary product of synthesis, a biomagnetic formative and levitative current, will not be elaborated in more detail here, since we are primarily interested in the solution of the problem of heating, namely, with the function 4 Calyx = the sepals of a flower collectively forming the outer floral envelope, protective of the bud. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Klimator 169 of the secondary or reflux current. This is a potential with which it is possible to heat up a space from the ceiling downwar ds, like the Sun does. It is a radi- ant form of heat, which heats the whol e space evenly. If th e intensity of the small heating resistance (element) is reduced, however, for which the rate of rotation of the agitator must be incr eased, then the living space is suffused with an evenly dispersed, rising, expa nding and high-altitude-like fresh air. In this way the natural, reactive form s of temperature are produced nearly free of cost, through which the natura l warmth of the valley-climate comes into being. It is a mountain micro-climate. The Klimator represents the most basic developmental form in which the natural, primary motive forces can evolve, whose two components are to be differentiated as: (a) The metaphysical, which acts from the inside outwards, and (b) The physical, which acts from the outside inwards. Both these higher forms of pressure and suction together produce the 'original' form of motion through wh ich the higher influence arises, which in turn generates the increased and qualitatively improved, primary life-energy. This original way of generating natu ral formative and levitative essences is exploited by the stationary trout, which stands motionless in fast-flowing torrents and darts upstream like lightning when danger threatens, wherein it cannot only overcome its own body-weight, but also, swimming freely and without other assistance, overcomes the weight of the oncoming water. This was previously inexplicable as far as science was concerned. The secret of this mysterious overcoming of gravity solves the problem of the aforementioned, hitherto unknown synthesising current, which is trig- gered off through the cold metabolic process. Contemporary science knows nothing about it, because it only uses warm processes of oxidation, which triggers the counter-current to the above current. This, however, is the most dangerous current of all. This annihilating current science uses for mechanical power and to heat living spaces. The suppression of the life-current means the gradual elimin- ation of the life-force leading to disease and premature death. Progress can only be made in the search for the synthesising current and quality of life when all substances ar e moved inwindingly. The cyloidally moving Earth demonstrates this to us daily. It was a trout that showed it to me. With the Klimator, the Repulsator and the Repulsine the first atom-bomb that rises can be produced instead of one that falls.

The no longer mysterious secret of the naturalesque generation of power, heat, cold and light lies hidden in th e substance that today's technologists combust, from which the so-called 'calories' arise, and which understandably disappear when we drive our machines with Nature's principal formative substance (fatty-matter), or use it for heating or for generating low-grade light. Derived from the ancient Greek word 'technao', technology means 'self-cheat- ing' or 'self-deception'. Actually it ought to be called 'stupidity', because all we have to do is merely to move what actually 'moves, heats and illuminates' naturalesquely in order to be able to set every kind of machine in motion 'originally' or to produce heat and light naturalesquely. For this reason the ancient Greeks also rejected 'technology' in any form. Instead they captured slaves so as to have the more demeaning and demand- ing tasks carried out by these natural machines, which run on metaphysical fatty-matter. In order to eat today the wretched slav es scramble for work, burrowing into the earth for coal, felling the forests and extracting oil from the ground, in order, so they believe, to alleviate their lot, but achieve precisely the opposite. More and more people have to work and the more diligently they slave away, the more keenly the hung er they will have to experience, because without coal, timber and oil no growth of vegetation is possible. In other words, there will be an increasing dearth of all that is most vital to life, if by the sweat of our brows we inhibit the build-up of quality matter and exploit Nature's most important formative substance - fatty-matter - for every possible and impossible purpose, i.e. to drive machines and for ridiculous methods of lighting and heating: All this in the belief that these earthly residues of fatty- matter would in any case be reduced to dust and ashes if left in the ground, and therefore it does not matter whether we make soap or something else out of them, or merely combust them. Today this is totally unnecessary. Naturally there will be a hue and cry from all the well-camouflaged slave-masters, who earn fat sums through those they lead around by the no se, once the bio-technical secret is revealed and the mentally castrated work-oxen are show n the way to move this mysterious fatty-matter naturalesquely.

To learn this art it is necessary above a ll to explain two fundamental concepts. Firstly, what actually is 'substance' a nd secondly what actually is 'motion' ? From a naturalesque viewpoint, the term 'substance' is to be envisaged as a more or less highly developed energy-concentrate; a lattice of atoms, as it were, or as the word 'lattice' implies, a sort of prison, in which Nature's prin- cipal formative substance - the fatty-matter in the process of change and formation - also resides in an allotrop ic (naturally congealed or condensed) state. This only awaits the naturalesque motive impulse in order to be elevated to a 'freely moving' atomic state, which happens all the more rapidly, the faster this energy-concentrate in a latent tran sitional state is rotated in inwinding space-spiral-curves about its own axis by means of so-called venal-motion. Immediately thereafter, what has come into being in this way is moved further in so-called arterial-motion in order to distribute what has been 'freely formed' by way of naturalesque rhythmical motion through the surrounding body (the soil) in order to bring it to life. With this the secret of biotechnical motion stands revealed and all that remains is to explain the mysterious m achine with which it is possible to ur- generate the 'originally moving and resu scitating', i.e. a hi gher-grade potential. With its use all machines can be powered and our homes heated and illuminated independently. Mo reover, all growth - which is none other than the natural solidification of energy-concentrates - can be stimulated and increased as well as qualitatively improved. In short, our every wish can be fulfilled with very little effort. Naturally all this will be described as Utopian, as the product of a deranged mind intent on creating all kinds of confusion amidst the present economic chaos caused by the insanity of com busting Nature's most vital primary substances. Consequently, great concer n for the continuing supply of fatty- matter will inevitably arise; a substance that nowadays not only every house- wife lacks 5 , but one that is also lacking in the form of what might be called 'cerebral lubricant'. For it is from the brain that all healthy thoughts arise, and above all the idea of doing things in acco rdance with Nature in the future; something the director of an institute for commodity studies naturally cannot immediately appreciate. Therefore a number of other things must be explained in greater detail in order to make it clear to the various ministers of government departments as well. This is necessary so as to enable an increased production of commodities and above all a faster growth of calories, which under the present circumstances are not only being increasingly wasted, but ultimately would go to waste entirely were such individuals not 5 This relates to the severe food shortages and ra tioning in Austria in the immediate post-war period. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"172 The Energy Evolution to be enlightened by an outsider. That is, were the fundamental concepts of 'biotechnology' not explained in a generally understandable way. Under the concept 'motion' we have to visualise a rhythmical combination of pressure and suction, wherein it is of crucial importance whether pressure or suction predominates. If the former prevails, then a decadent potential or expressed more scientifically, an oxidati on, takes place, which should generally be understood as a highly combustive process that inhibits development. In contrast, if suction prevails during a naturalesque course of motion, then a reduction process occurs, which is here to be generally understood as the aforesaid higher-grade transformation of an already high-grade material into spirit, or expressed more scientifically, into the above form of higher-grade potential. Naturally, this is also the source of higher-grade temperature and light phenomena, which as development -furthering instrumentalities, foster the development of naturalesque motive forces, high-grade heat and cold as well as light. In this formative process il primo m overe, the initial motive impulse, also plays a decisive role. If any motion is actuated by a pressure-induced axial->radial (see fig. 14) impulse and pr essure prevails, then the decadent form of potential results, because in this case the atom lattice ruptures due to the release of its content of unipolar and highly aggressive allotropic oxygen. In other words, when the oxygen has attain ed the energetic state that enables it to encircle the fatty-matter (carbone). The latter having become passive and coincident (internally collapsed) under th is lower-grade heat influence, the oxygen loops around it in spiral-space- curves, and engulfs, consumes and digests it. The offspring of this outbirth of d ecadent energies are lower-grade temper- atures, i.e. rising heat-forms and falli ng cold-forms, which foster the decay process. Subsequently, with the aid of these solidifying cold-forms, the relape into the earth of what has missed its way on evolution's upward path ensues. However, if a motion is initiated by a radial->axial impulse, i.e. if the initiat- ing upward suction and inward impulsi on are triggered simultaneously, then firstly the atom lattice of basic elem ents is disassembled naturalesquely, because under this centripetal motion it is only the oxygen that reacts and contracts into itself. Secondly, due to the developing coolness that occurs with all sucking action, the fatty-matter (carbones), which become free, unipolar and highly active then encircles the oxygen, also loops around it in inwinding spiral curves, and engulfs and digests it. The product of this metabolic process is the higher-grade potential, which i mmediately gives rise to higher-grade temperature-forms, i.e. falling and concentrating heat-forms and rising and expanding invigorative cold-forms. These combine the highest-grade elements into a new atom lattice and propel the product of this high-grade synthesis, which already has a desire to rise, into even higher zones of evolvement."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Klimator 173 To restate the process briefly: axial->r adial ex-pulsion results in ex-plosion, decay and combustion. Ira-pulsion, or a radial->axial impetus results in im-plosion, ennoblement and autonomous upward displacement (levitation). In this case reactive suctional forces opera te first during the ascent and are then reinforced by supplementary reactive forces. This is how physical weight is overcome naturalesquely, during which process the already higher-grade energetic ballasting elements are precipitated out and manifest themselves as falling and concentrating heat-forms. If this formative process is copied naturalesquely in a so-called Klimator (see figs. 27 and 28), which is suspe nded from the ceiling and moved bio- centrifugally then a falling and concen trating heat-form is produced with which the living space can be natu ralesquely heated in winter. If these invigorative cold-forms with their rising and expanding properties are introduced into an evacuated glass bulb, then the energy-concentrates, which in any case move exceptionally rapidl y, exceed their highest velocity in this resistance-less space. In the pro cess they eject high-grade ballast material which interacts with the residual oxygen still present in an extremely rarefied state. The product of this renewed uni on is atmospheric space-light, natural- esquely copied sunlight as it were. This evolves and lights up the vacuum bulb when the bulb, which has no other connections apart from the earth- wire, is merely earthed. All that is required therefore is to connect the earth- wire in order to make the living space as bright as day. To extinguish this natural light, which is of course temperatureless, the earth-wire is simply disconnected. If virtually free mechanical power is required, then the above higher-grade heating effects merely need to be sw itched off, thus converting them into formative and levitative invigorative fo rms (cold-forms). This immediately reactivates the ' ur-powerfully-waxing' buoyant motion, which here should be envisaged as a bio-magnetic up-current (a synthesising current). With elemental force arising from an energy gradient that evolves along a common developmental axis, this up-current sucks up the generating device in its wake, i.e. it effortlessly overcomes its own weight. Aircraft, submarines or heavy projectiles can be propelled like lightning in this way at negligible cost. In stationary machines on the other hand, which must be well anchored to the ground, the indrawn air will be almost instantaneously decomposed, trans- formed and built up as described earlie r by passing through a curviform pipe. The concurrently coincident water, i.e. the discharged and inwardly collapsed medium, will be expelled at the same time, resulting in the ur-generation of a high-grade high-quality space - the 'organic' vacuum. This is the opposite of atmospheric air pressure and is the best and cheapest attractional force to be found anywhere on this planet. It is also the 'space' that produces ray-like forms which penetrate through al l enclosures and stream upwards."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"174 The Energy Evolution If a communicating pipe is interposed between this naturalesquely evacu- ated highly potent vacuity imbued with qualigens and the outer pressure of atmospheric space, and if a propeller or tu rbine is installed inside it, then the external atmospheric pressure exerts a force of 1 atm/cm 2 on the inclined blades of the propeller (turbine). Since any desired volume of air can be reduced (transformed into formations of qualigen) in a fraction of a second with a naturalesquely constructed Repulsine (see figs. 30-33), for which at most a driving force of 0.8 kW is required, the levitative torque-producing force generated, or more correctly ur-generated, in this way is as good as free. For here, with increasing velocity due to the upward activation of the a bove bio-synthesising torque-producing force, the Repulsine's power increases by the square of the ur-generative motion. This is to be compared with the increase in the resistance to motion in all 'technical' machines, where understa ndably, due to the reversed direction of motion the forces of recoil increase in the same ratio as described above. That is to say, today's technology strives to move forwards with forces that operate backwards. Logically what has b een achieved is not only a reversal of motion, but also of the economy; an economic decline resulting from the mechanical build-up of decadent repulsi ve pressures, which naturally have a decadent or destructive effect economic ally. Consequently, the economy will become increasingly unhealthy, the mo re widespread and intensive such technology, this self-deception becomes, or to put it mildly, the more the abysmal stupidity of generating decadent energies mechanically takes effect. This tragic aberration was inaugurated by the foolish belief that the progress of evolution comes to a halt wh en the life-functions are apparently extinguished and that the so-called s oul escapes after the cessation of vital activity. In reality the true resurrection only begins after the proper decompo- sition of an atom lattice (fatty-matter con centrate) that has fallen back into the earth with the aid of and because of the cycloid-space-curve motion of the Earth itself, which provides the radial->axial im-pulse. In contrast, all 'technical' machines, i.e. all dynamos, turbines, pressure pumps, propellers, explosion and steam driven engines, all furnaces, gas and electric heating appliances, all soil-tilling and harvesting machinery, etc. provide a developmentally harmful ex-pulse to initiate motion. Because of this and without exception, the atom lattice thus moved ruptures, resulting in the disintegration of the molecular (bacteriophagous) formations in suspension. In unnaturally moved air or water decadent stresses appear , causing the decay of the decivise energy-concentrates (as a graphic example, see hydraulic river regulation and torrent confinement 6 ). This leads to the build-up of decadent potential and the decomposition of the blood of the Earth, and thus to a total economic collapse along the whole course of development. 6 See sections on river engineering in The Water Wizard, Vol. I of the Ecotechnology series. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"I'he Klimator 175 The possibility of ur-generating virtua lly free mechanical power, heat, cold and temperature-less light, however, is only the first step towards cultural (economic) reconstruction.

With this water not only can reactive expansive pressures be gene rated and all petroleum fuels, etc. replaced, but all cancerous decay can also be healed naturally, which would revolutionise medicine, i.e. put it back on the right track. In a word, the naturalesque movement of any given medium and the atom lattice it contains, signifies a social rec onstruction in every sense, because all slave-labour will cease with the restora tion of natural abundance and free- dom of movement. Everyone will be fr ee and independent, and healthy once more in mind and body. This will happen for the sole reason that any given atom lattice - like the body of a dead animal or plant - can be transformed and built up with the aid of venal-mo tion, whereupon the subtle physical energies - the so-called life-forces - then come into being, which through this revitalising process move our bod ies originally (autonomously). Precisely the same thing happens at a large scale if we transform and build up bacteriophagous threshold structures (minute molecular atom lattices of water or air) mechanically through ve nal-motion, and thereafter distribute these specifically densified higher-grade energy-concentrates where required by way of arterial-motion. This will reimbue the surrounding body or geosphere - the macro atom lattice - with life and restore its inner vibration. We have only to intensify this formativ e oscillating motion in order to stimu- late the macro-climate or higher-grade potential out of which displacement, namely physical movement, reproduction and further development, arises as the biological sequel to a naturalesque motive impulse.

The Repulsine is a germinal-matter generator with which humanity can once more be returned to Paradise an d whence all wearers of mitre-boards, gowns, cassocks and cowls will have been expelled by fire and sword. Science and its berobed representatives would no longer be asked for their opinion and they will all be indicted regardless of whether they are knowingly or unknowingly guilty - questions they will have to decide for themselves. They will be accused of being accessories to th e crime against the germinating force.

The suppression of qualigen was therefore the precondition for the filthiest traffic there ever was, is or will be. In order to power its machines, today's science gives priority to an oxidising or metabolic process, wherein oxygen (atmospheric oxygen) - the natural stuff of breath - consumes the lower oxide or protoxide 1 (a type of metallic calc or calx 2 ) 1 Protoxide: The oxide of an element that contains the smallest amount of oxygen of any of its oxides.

This interchange of subs tance (metabolism,) is referred to as the 'normal' combustion process and people are of the mistaken opinion, that it gives rise to those carrying, shifting and orien ting forces that move and animate our bodies. This 'normal' process of combustion, whose dynamic product Nature uses to break down, decompose and eliminate the evolutionally unfit, is triggered in such a way that at about +40°C (+104°f), through the application of heat or fire, the oxygen becomes aggr essive and belligerent. If it is heated further, then it becomes even freer and more dangerous, leading to the decomposition of blood, water and sap. At this point all life-functions of whatever kind cease in all growing, li ving and autonomously moving things. The reason for this is the growing inactivity of the protoxide, which becomes less and less active as the above-normal temperature rises. The end- product of this immobilising process is annihilating fire. The dynamic product of this metabolic process is an increase in the 'normal' ri sing, expanding, and braking form of heat. This heat-form is alone responsible for the decomposition and elimination of the genetically a nd physically unsound as well as every- thing else that has failed to contribute to the progress of evolution. The antithesis of this growth-inhibiting form of heat is a. falling and concen- trating heat-form, which gives life to a ll those things destined to vegetate, reproduce and separate. It ensures growth and improves the condition of raw materials. The purpose of these cold or cooling substances is to separate the low-grade from the high-grade in the highe r realms of evolution and to trans- mute the latter into that, which the mysterious life- and motive-force gives to all living things.

It accords them physical and spiritual growth, repr oduction and upward evolvement and the increase in the quantity of raw materials and their ennoblement. This organic product of synthesis was hitherto unknown. For this reason it is so named, because it endows all living things with the power to raise them- selves up autonomously. It has remained unknown, because the form of motion was not perceived through which everything comes into being that we are able to see or become aware of all around us. This special form of motion will be called 'cycloid motion'. Blood makes use of it in the blood vessels, salts make use of it in plants and natural, untouche d rivers avail themselves of it as they flow through the countryside. It is the ur-origin of the fount of qualigen. It is both cause and criterion of all emergent life.

On the other hand, if the 'normal' metabolic process is inverted, th en the opposite dynamic product comes into being with the aid of'cycloid motion'. It is the initiator of health, which serves a higher form of development. It is the primal activator that Leonardo da Vinci called 'il primo motore'. It is vitalisin g force that Paracelsus named the 'life- elixir'; in short, it is the secret of all life and movement to which everything on Earth owes its life and mobility. Therefore every living thing and all that moves and has its being of its own free will, owes its very existence to this 'cycloid motion'. If it tires and wanes, then physical life comes to an end. Once ended, the period of metaphysical development, the unfolding of the evolutionally older life 5 , the build-up of qualigen or the formation of 'higher influences' begins. Science and technology scorn and scoff at anyone closely connected to Nature, who does something differently and more correctly and in so doing, reverses the metabolic process so harmfu l to growth. Quite logically therefore such individuals create the product of sy nthesis that promotes the build-up of qualigen. Today's science has no inkling that the formative fructigens react to centrifugence and that the seminal substances required for the development of more highly evolved products, react to centripetence. With the aid of cycloid motion and its analysing function, the smothered (de-animated) fructigen is separated from the anima ting oxygen (for in cycloid motion centripetence and centrifugence operate simultaneously). Science likewise has no idea that 'higher temperature influences' are able to change the characteristic inner properti es completely (inversion of charge or potential) and reverse the polarities. In this connection it is to be noted that the formative fructigens become highly activ e and the debilitated oxygen inactive, due to the simultaneous action of catalytic and oligodynamic factors. With the simultaneous precipitating out of the erstwhile carrier-substance, the opposite product of synthesis comes into existence. It is quality itself in statu nascendi - the procreative em bryo. This now consumes the counter- weighing resistance to weightlessness and in this way develops into the primordial, formative force or the true stu ff of levitation. Against this there is no gravity, i.e. everything will be carried aloft with elemental ur-force. Those scientists and technologists, who inaugurate the reversed metabolic process, therefore create the annihilating energy-form by the sweat of their brows.

Although there are very minor fluctuations, this im pulsive and propulsive force always remains constant. As the motive force increases, more and more seminal sub- stances (motion-impeding substances) are generated, whose polarity has been reversed in the process. In conseque nce the counter-active resistance they would otherwise offer is neutralised. This diametrically opposed metabolic process or reversal of polarity is conditional on the inactivity of the oxygen and the highly active state of the protoxide. It is achieved through the effe cts of reactive temperatures, or more accurately, through the action of falling and concentrating heat and rising and expanding cold. The more intense the effect of these 'higher' influences, the moire inactive the oxygen and the more aggr essive and ravening the protoxide becomes. The crucial factor in the mechanical propagation of formative embryos is the naturalesque conversion of normal temperatures, whose effects are oppo- site in nature, into reactive functions. The exploitation of this discovery will completely revolutionise economic activity. It is therefore the machine, which makes the creation of these embryos of qualigen possible by reversing the polarities and functions of the component forces. It is the organ that provides the growth-promoting metabolic process in the organic raw material required for development. If this concept is taken to its logi cal conclusion and these mechanically produced, formative embryos are combined with the various media of water, earth, sap and air, then the resultant productivity is truly staggering. From this moment on, everything into which qualigen has been incorporated, starts to reproduce itself and upwardly evolve. It begins to multiply itself qualitatively and to improve itself qualitatively. Logically therefore, the physical and mental condition of all humanity will also be raised indirectly and the standard of living rapidl y improved, because the beneficial effects of incor- porating additional levitative material into the various foodstuffs in this way, will be transferred to the human consum er.

The Suction Turbine Viktor Schauberger, April 1958, Implosion Magazine, No.114, pp 54-57 The abundance-producing water wheel, which functions using centrifugal pressure, principally consists of a double membrane (see plan and cross-section in fig. 30), which rotates anti-clockwise about a vertical axis with the aid of a low-power drive motor. The so-called whorl-pipe is wound around the vertical shaft centred on this axis. Viewed from below, the whorl-pipe rotates in a clockwise direction and without any resistance, sucks up the centripetally compressed drive-water. The faster the drive motor propels th e water (which is orbiting about and rotating within itself) through the double-membrane, the greater the quantity of water scooped up by the intake at the lower end of the whorl-pipe, which swirls inwards and upwards in a clockw ise direction only to be centrifugated outwards and downwards in rhythmically alternating horizontal and vertical currves, and then centripetated inwindingly again in systems of nozzles. That is to say: Continuous (= one-s ided) rotation has a braking effect. Therefore: Ascent of the water in the whorl-pipe clockwise. This is followed by the swirling expulsion of the water in the double-membrane right out to the egg-shaped nozzle opening 6 in which, under enormous centrifugal pres- sure, the drive-water is once again moved centripetally. It then flows at a very high exit velocity into the lower herme tically sealed pressure chamber, which, under hydraulic excess pressure, then im pels the water originally drawn up by the suction whorl-pipe back towards the whorl-pipe intake. 7 This means: The suctional force must be and so remain the predominant force throughout the whole sequence of motion.

Here the oxygen is cooled (falling [positive] temperature-gradient) a nd in this condition is encircled and bound (emulsified = consumed and dig ested) by the hydrogen of opposite polarity, which actually has an upward velocity of about 2 m/sec. The product of this emulsive process (t he ur-procreative act) is diamagnet- ism. Functioning as levitational force (autonomous resurrective energy), it raises naturalesquely moved water to the highest mountain peaks (viz. true high-mountain springs). The movement of blood and sap is equally the prod- uct of the above emulsion = the inne r combination (marriage) of opposing bipolar basic substances in order to re-create a unity (individuality) comprised of opposites. Today's technology operates exclusiv ely with excess pressure and dis- regards the developmentally important suctional components. What is achieved, therefore, is an increase in pressure, friction and heat. These result in the reversed emulsive effects, which in turn produce predominantly dielectric forms of flow-motion. Since heat is the lowest form of electricity and electricity decomposes water, sap and blood, retrogressive development (= cancer) must ensue all down the line. Whereas excess pressure oppresses all growth, under-pressure (slight suction or vacuum) - the upwardly impelling diamagnetic force - fosters it. The faster the double-membrane's driv e-motor rotates, the more drive- water is uptaken and the higher the cen tripetal compression becomes, which then discharges through the pressure nozzl es. This intensifies the rotary force in the opposite direction, which must be braked with a dynamo (electric current generator) in order to prevent the rupture of the suction turbine and its disintegration due to constantly increasing centrifugal pressure. The centripetal compression in the nozzles is regulated by the rate of rotation of the drive-motor. Acting together the two magnitudes of compression and rotation determine the overall power output which, produced by the nozzle pressure, acts in the opposite direction to that of the discharge.

The suction turbine is the first machine that operates with reciprocally inter- active reactive forces. The immensity of the forces released through a properly constructed and precisely calculated suction turbine is attested by the well-known equation for centrifugal force. If 1 litre (0.264 gal) = 1 kg (2.2 lbs) of water is centrifugated at 10,000 rpm at a radius of 10 cm (4 in.) and suddenl y centripetated in the compression nozzles (see sketch - fig. 29), then at a dischar ge velocity of about 40 m/sec (130 ft / sec), which corresponds to a geological head of pressure of about 400 metres (1,312 ft), repulsive forces ar e freed, which are equivalent to an increase in pressure of 57,000 kg (125,400 lbs). This solves the great problem of energy supply simply and cheaply, and what is more, naturalesquely. What is and remains remarkable is that no-one understands how to trans- form the cheapest and most powerful r eactive force - centrifugal force - into centripetal force (a reactive suctional force), through which the resistance to motion in all today's machines can be transformed into additional power. That is, instead of an efficiency of rou ghly 10% -12% as has been the case thus for, an efficiency of up 96% can be exploited.

For decades medical science has sought th e so-called 'life-curve' in which the two reciprocally interactive component forces of suction and pressure inter- sect one another in such a way that at the point of intersection an energetic interplay of different emulsions takes place. Pressure- and fire-technology produces and exploits the rising (negativ e) temperature gradient exclusively and consequently creates excessively str ong repulsive forces, which logically act to inhibit development. While it is true that the falling temperature gradient is known to science, up to now it has not been in a position to activate it. Science has therefore had to put up with braking reactive forces, which become free and active when the medium of water or air is moved along straight paths by physical excess pres- sures of whatever kind (gradient or pressure-pump). The same also applies to rotary motion, where meanders and sinuosities are absent and in which over- strong frictional, thermal and expansiv e forces become active. By way of products of reversed emulsions they enforce the emergence of exceptionally decomposive energies. The resistance to motion, th e result of an unnatural increase in velocity which rises by the s quare, is the biological consequence of an unnatural and therefore false type of mo tion. This is particularly true in the case of all contemporary turbines, which centrifugate the driving medium - water. Moreover; science uses paramagnetic material (steel, etc.), which with an increase in heat (heat is the lowest form of electricity) gives birth to additional decomposive energy (electricity). As a result of this finding experiments were also made to rotate water in meander-forms made of diamagnetic mate rial (copper, bronze, etc.). Even diamagnetic wood can be used. Out of these experiments arose the double- membrane, which with increasing radius automatically increases the flow-through velocity, if the angle of th e alternately disposed slip-surfaces is flattened out towards the periphery. Fig. 30 (Diagram 1) depicts such a double-membrane (a rotating meander) in which the water is partly sucked, part ly propelled upwards by means of a counter-rotating whorl-pipe (= cycloid-sp ace-spiral). The wate r is then evenly dispersed in the opposite direction, rota ted within and about its own axis and in this way the centre of gravity of the flow-through material is displaced towards the centre of the axis. Here there are two possibilities for incr easing the exit velocity relative to the intake velocity as desired and to rai se its carrying capacity and tractive force at the same time through specific den sation. As already mentioned earlier, this naturally presupposes an improvement quality."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Machines of the Genus — Repulsine 185 Either an inwinding water movement , therefore the centripetence of the draining water will be achieved with appropriately designed spiral-forms that make use of an existing geological gradient, or the suction-turbine will be rotated by the drive-motor while still empty and once the desired rpm have been reached, the drive-water will then be introduced and sucked from inside towards the periphery with increasing ve locity. A suction th at extends back- wards is thus created, which is produced by the faster outward moving, specifically densitying plug of water. This exits at a velocity, which can be regulated as desired and activates a recoil, which in kinetic terms is the same as the exit velocity. In order to move air above its bou ndary velocity, which under a falling (positive) temperature gradient results in its retro-formation into a watery substance, special spiral-helical shapes must be used in order to achieve the same effect described earlier. This spir al-helical form is like a hollow pro- peller, which once again partly sucks in and partly impresses the surrounding air masses. Here again, the suction components must predominate in order to prevent any pressure and heat stresses. In this manner biologically-correct emulsions occur, whose products are diamagnetically supercharged energies, which levitate and draw up their gene rating device in their wake (viz. the behaviour of the trout, which cannot be explained mechanically, but only atomically). To emphasise the point once more: Everything is reversible in Nature and hence there are also atomic energies that are not life-destroying, but life-creating. The latter cannot be produced in a cyclotron and so atomic physicists must also be taught that two different things happen, depending on whether a medium, to which ultimately the primary building blocks of Nature - the atoms - belong, is initially subjected to pressure or sucked up to a higher valency. The attached sketch-diagram is actua lly extremely primitive. It is enough, however, to enable a halfway naturalisti c viewer to get an inkling of what serious and fateful errors are being ma de by today's atomic experts, for apparently not one of them has ever c onsidered what 'motion' actually is and what biological role it plays. Namely, that death and life depend on the way a medial structure or entity moves and thus vast differences exist between atomic destruction and atomic transformation, for an incorrect motion begets the embryos of death. It is, and was always so, that he who makes a mistake fails to see it, whereas to an outsider, or to a 'layman' as is so often said, it immedi- ately springs to the eye. For a sharp-eyed observer of Nature it is simply incomprehensible that science does not recognise the interconnections that exist between forest and water; that through the disturbance of this bipolarity the differences in potential between th e negatively charged geosphere and the positively supercharged atmosphere diminish, causing the groundwater table to sink and the high-grade mountain springs to dry up as a result."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"186 The Energy Evolution If water is recharged with geospherical en ergies, then it begins to rise again autonomously and supplies all the vege tation, including man and beast, with aetheric nutritive substances.

For this reason all today's expansion- explosion machines, pressure turbines, etc. destroy life and must be replaced by implosive devices and apparatuses if all humanity is not to perish unc onditionally through the mass-murder of every prerequisite for life of whatever kind. For whoever disturbs Nature's household is irretrievably lost. Un-Natural Motion - Embryonic Death Sherman, Texas, USA, 23rd/24th August 1958 (Schauberger Archives). Suction Turbine: The essential difference between suction and pressure turbines is as follows: (a) The rotation of pressure turbines is i nduced by the pressure of falling water, (b) The rotation of suction turbines is initiated by an auxiliary motor. In the suction-turbine, the drive-wa ter is introduced once the rotational velocity has been reached sufficient to meet the desired power requirement. Conducted centripetally, this water screws upwards all the more rapidly, the faster the suction-turbine rotates. The upwardly screwed drive-water is then passed through a double mem- brane and moved in such a way as to rotate in an anticlockwise direction while simultaneously rotating about its ow n a x i s (i.e. about and within itself orbitally and axially), its velocity increasing towards the periphery."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Machines of the Genus — Repulsine 187 This motion between membranes can be likened to the path of a skier, who transfers his body-weight rhythmically from one foot to the other during his descent, thereby augmenting the speed of descent. The faster the alternation in the displacement of body-weight, the faster the rate of travel (see fig. 36). The same thing takes place in the sucti on-turbine, whereby in the course of the above inwinding and by way of almost frictionless motion and accelera- tion, the drive-water becomes specifically denser as it approaches its anomaly point - 'the biological zero-point'. Now in an almost homogenous condition owing to this particular form of motion, this water is subsequently collected and accumulated in an annular pressure zone (see fig. 33e). A ring of jet-nozzles is incorporated around the periphery of this pressure ring in which pressures arise, whose intensity increases as the machine is rotated by the auxiliary motor (impulse motor). The apertures of these jet- nozzles must be of small enough size to permit the release of the accumulated excess pressure only. The exiting high velo city 'jet-water' then impacts with high pressure onto a system of specially constructed blades (these have a certain similarity to the blade-system of a Pelton wheel). In contrast to those of the Pelton wheel, however, these are arranged in inverted form and in wreath-like manner. Once again in a manner akin to the Pelton wheel, the water is expressed laterally virtually free of pressure, and further accelerated by means of a rotat- ing egg-shaped form due to the fact th at in this form the radius increases towards the base. This newly accelerated water is then inwound once more, becoming specifically denser in the pro cess, and at high velocity enters an hermetically sealed, but stationary pressure-chamber from the periphery (tangentially). In so doing a hydraulic excess pressure is created, which dis- charges towards the lower suction whorl-pipe opening - once again in the opposite direction -, the upward angle of which is engineered in such a way that the above excess pressure also rema ins constant. In other words no more water can be screwed upwards than is desired and because of this a constant rotational velocity is achieved. If the above rotational velocity is incr eased by means of the impulse motor, then the quantity of upwardly screwed water also increases, whose naturally induced excess pressure increases by the square in contrast to artificially created pressures using conventional m eans. In this case the output increases analogously, but without any excessive demand for more material (fuel), for due to the increasing centripetence of th e drive-water, the centrifugal pressure also increases commensurately. The drive-water, which frees itself from the conducting wall-surfaces during flow - see Prof. Popel's expert opinion 9 - descends almost without friction as a result and, because it seeks a straight passage between the meander-like 9 This appears on p. 219 of this book. - E d ."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"188 The Energy Evolution membranes, is impelled by a succession of thrusting, rotational impulses and exits at the closely-spaced wreath of turbine blades (see figs. 33d & 33e 10 ) When the drive-water enters the herm etically sealed pressure-chamber, an atomic retro-pulsive force is additiona lly created, which is equal in magni- tude to the velocity of the exiting wa ter above, because the levitational force mentioned in the previous chapter, discharges in the same anticlockwise direction as the rotating machine. Here too the same counterforce appears, which maintains the steadiness of flow over constantly varying gradients characteristic of naturalesquely regulated riverwaters. This effect is wholly unknown to conventional science and hence the above motive principle is likewise as good as in comprehensible to any pressure- and fire-engineer, who hitherto has been incap able of triggering the 'falling heat- gradient'. Through the agency of this gradient water can be specifically densi- fied by being inwound in cycloid-spiral-space-curves - like the movement of blood and sap, and in this way can be accel erated to any desi red velocity with- out the need to make allowance for th e effect of centrifugal braking pressures, In this regard it is to he noted that the movement of blood and sap is not the result of hydraulic pressure (the suppo sed pumping action of the heart), but is caused to move orbitally, axially an d predominantly centripetally due to the evolution of potential differences. In emulation of this, the suction turbine therefore faithfully copies the original , natural circulation of blood and sap. The pressure- and fire-technologist generates kinetic energy by expansive and explosive means exclusively. In contrast, the bio-ecotechnologist does this by indirect means - and in this lies th e crucial difference between natural and unnatural and therefore false methods of acceleration. Today's technologist achieves an increase in resistance to mo tion that rises by the square, whereas the bio-ecotechnologist achieves a reactive effect, which is evolution- promoting, virtually cost-free and increasable at will to any desired intensity. More precise details can only be explai ned with the aid of an actual model. These clarifications and supplementary information will be given to the atomic scientists, Chief Engineer, Eric. A. Boerner and my contract partner Mr. Robert Dormer of Colorado Springs at the meeting in Sherman in 14 days' time (this date was set for me by Mr Robert Dormer's representative, Herrn Karl Gerchsheimer).

Incidentally it should also be noted here, that the ennoblement of water takes place according to the very same principle.

Please note that the carrying capacity, increase in tractive force and the amelioration in quality of mixtures of solid, liquid and gaseous or aeriform substances, which carry bipolar charges, are only possible with the aid of the 'falling heat-gradient', i.e. with the fo rm of motion that causes the substance to approach the anomaly point (+4°C - + 39.2°F).

Application for Patent No. 146 141 Viktor Schauberger at Wien-Hadersdorf, Austria, 4th March 1940. Processes and Equipment for the Atomic Transformation of Droppable Liquids or Gaseous Substances. It is known that atomic transformation has been carried out by way of atomic destruction without having achieved any useful economic or commercial results in the process. It is also known that dissociation and recombination, therefore the rearrangement of the atoms, can be effected in the substrate with the aid of catalytic processes. In this regard it has been observed that these processes take place in a characteristic cycle or oscillating rhythm until a new state of equilibrium is established. The process for the atomic transformation of liquid or gaseous bodies associated with this invention takes this rhythmical tendency during the course of such processes into account from the very beginning. Namely, in accordance with the invention, the afor esaid substances will be subjected to an increasingly rapid flow-motion, during which these substances will be exposed to alternating strong suctional and pressural forces, which results in significant changes to their surface tension. Furthermore, this invention also ma kes use of the fact that the presence of certain substances, especially metals such as copper, silver or gold, for example, or those substances collectively termed synthetic resins (plastics), which are decisive for the progress of the vital functions in liquids or gases (air) and whose effect can in part be described as oligodynamic."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"190 The Energy Evolution Therefore if the said course of motion of the substances to be dissociated is also allowed to proceed oligodynamically , then the severing of the atom it- bonds can be successfully achieved to a la rge extent and considerable energies freed. These freed energies can readily be brought into new combinations, such as for the further development of the atoms of primary gaseous sub- stances into liquid or even solid form ations, or these energies may be drawn off or diverted in some other way. An example of the device for implementing this process is depicted on the drawing. Diagram 1 shows a section taken through a - b on the top view, Diagram 2 (see figs. 30 & 31). Two circular sheet-metal plates (1 & 2) made of silver-plated or amalgamated copper are press-formed in such a way that they are endowed with a waviform shape and are superimposed on one another in such a way as to create a waviform inte rsticial space (3). Both plates are main- tained at a distance from one another by already known methods. The lower plate (2) is attached to the backing plat es (4 & 5), which are insulated from one another by a hard-rubber plate (6). On the upper plate (1) two (three or more) cover-plates are mounted in such a way that they initially rest on the wave- crests of such plate before gradually tapering downwards into the wave- troughs. In this way the narrowing pressure-chambers (8) are formed, whose longitudinal axes run parallel to the circ umference. On the inner inclined sur- faces of the upper plate (2), narrow slits (9) are incised. The central component (10) incorporates a spacer-ring (22). Sp acer-rings incorporating nozzles can be provided in the intersticial space (3). Furthermore, the hollow shaft (22) opens into the cup-shaped component (23), whose inner surface is advantageously fluted, and which has exit openings (2 4) into the intersticial space (3). If the device is caused to rotate rapidly in the direction of the arrow (see Diagram 2), then the liquid or gase ous substances entering the pressure- chambers (8) at (25) will be impre ssed downwards and sideways through the slits (9) into the intersticial space (3), in which a considerable suction evolves, so that the space (3) acts as a suction-chamber. The whole device therefore represents a kind of multi-stage centrifuge, each concentric wave being regarded as a stage. It can readily be understood that the liquid or gaseous substance present in the pressure-chamber (8), having been subjected to strong pressural forces here, immediately passes through the slits (9) in the pressure-chamb er walls and partially expands. At an appropriate rate of rotation a maximum pressure will be reached, under which a bio-electrical energy evolves, with whose aid the primary combinations of the through-flowing liquid or gaseous substances will split up, whereupon these freed energies can be synthesised into any desired form or be drawn off.

Excerpt from Patent Letter to Munich Patent Office From Implosion Magazine, No. 87, written in Linz, September 1955. y reason of research work carried out over more than 30 years, I can provide irrefutable proof that centrifugal acceleration triggers off decentrating, reactive fo rces. Through the hither to unnoticed, instant- aneous pole-reversal in the lower world of bipolar basic elements, decomposive forces evolve in the media of water and air. This results in the killing off of noble bacteria. In the dying water symp toms of decay appear and pathogenic bacteria come to life, leading to the de velopment of cancer. For this reason the unreal systems of motion taught in a ll universities are the true cause of cancer. Plasmic disturbances occur, whic h for lack of adequate replenishment of qualigen, lead to the death of the cells, if metallic toxins form on the cell- membrane. This happens as a result of the accumulation of certain metal ions, to which the oligodynamic extermination of pathogenic bacteria by silver ions is also attributable. These do inde ed disinfect the contaminated water, although further possibilities for re-infestation are not removed. On the contrary, if the causes are not correctly combatted biologically, then increas- ingly developmentally harmful parasites gradually propagate in the further degenerating water, resulting in its total contamination. The same applies to chlorinated water, since in both cases processes of elec- trolytic decomposition occur. Georg Krause of Munich was able to control this B"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Last Letters from Viktor Schauberger 197 so accurately with his electro-catadyn e process that the water thus treated was apparently purified bacteriall y and hence became potable drinking water. In reality, however, water thus treat ed is not immune to the toxic effects resulting from the formation of increasingly dangerous bacteria. As is the case with agriculture, these have to be combatted with even stronger poisonous sprays. However, if water or air is moved predominantly centripetally in specially constructed and alloyed sucti on-screw systems (my principal patent claim), then a negative ion concentration ev olves of up to 90%, which emulsifies the attendant oxygen. This results in a drop in pressure and heat, due to the specific densation of the naturally moving, through-flowing material. In this case concentrative reactive forces are active. Their products become densified along the longitudinal axis and propagate in a predominantly vertical direc- tion. On account of their enormous velocity, they draw up the device that produces them in their wake. Seen from this point of view, the assertion by a nuclear physicist in the USSR is correct. He stated that all the available information in classical physics textbooks concerning the attracti on of mass is a stupendous mistake, since there is no such thing as an attracting force or mass-attraction. With increasing distance from the Earth, the ve locity of the self-purifying, emanat- ing substances becomes so great that an atomic vacuum or vacuity is created behind them. As is known, this also develops behind a fast-moving vehicle and draws a closely-following motorcyclist along with it. This forward and upward suction also evolves in naturally inwound water, to which the stationary trout owe their motionless stance in fast-flowing water. Even the uplifting of the trout in waterfalls is founded on this action of suction, if the falling water-masses flow naturalesquely and inwind. In all cyclones, typhoons and hurricanes forces are active, albeit hitherto unknown reactive forces, which are the causal agents of this catastrophic upward- wrenching effect. Conversely, every propeller (the archimedean pressure- screw) functions like a dynamo and because of this the mysterious air-crashes over particularly charged or potentiated areas of water and high-grade forests can be correctly understood for the first time, due to the fact that these areas send pressure-sensitive ions aloft. When the bankers, who were financi ng conventional hydroelectric power stations and the manufacture of aircraft fitted with propellers or other forms of pressure screw, began to understand my fairly detailed explanations, it was no wonder that such financial institutions and their patent attorneys lost all interest in the granting of patent rights. As an old-age pensioner, I am not in a position to take up arms successfully against the whole scientific establish- ment. For this reason I have to remain silent, keeping the most pertinent and crucial details from the public until I ha ve managed to find other financiers."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"198 The Energy Evolution Excerpts from Letter No. 1 to Josef Brunnader Written in Linz, 25 /12 /1955 Many thanks for the two letters I fo und upon my return from the turbine works where my suction-turbine, whic h has already reached an advanced stage, is being built. Without these prac tical results, every attempt to return humanity to Nature would be a wasted effort. The booklet 'Implosion instead of Explosion' 1 prompted the director of a major European turbine-works to ask me whether I would be prepared to receive his scientific adviser and to explain the essential nature of the naturalesque build-up of potential to him, which viewed biologically is the build-up of quality-matter. Shortly thereafter I was sent a book entitled Fundamental Principles of Potentisation Research. From th is it was apparent that despite very expensive experiments in this complex matter, no-one had yet been able to arrive at a solution and even the information provided by the anthro- posophist L. Kolisko, based on Rudolf Stei ner's instructions, was to no avail, Apart from me, no one has yet succeeded in the resistance-free acceleration of medial masses by means of a falling thermal gradient. In the turbine-works, where my suction-turbine is being built, it was admitted that the effects of all contemporary pressure-turbine systems, which trigger a rise in the temperature of the through-flow material, become all the more dangerous, the more the supposed efficiency or output is increased. With this it can be seen what is here i nvolved, i.e. as follows: In order to heal up 1 litre (0.264 gal) or 1 kilogram (2.2 lbs) of water by 1°C (1.8°F) from +14°C to +15°C (+57.2°F - +59.0°F), 1 kilo-calor ie = 5.4 horsepower is necessary. If for example, 1 m 3 (35.3 ft 3 ) of steam = 1 kg (2.2 lbs), is cooled from about +90°C to +4°C (+194°F - 39.2°F) by moving it in a planetary system of curves, then 86 kcal/sec are freed, which provide a dditional power in the order of 466.4 hp / sec, discounting minor frictional losses. With a diameter of 300 mm (1.0 ft) and at 1,000 rpm, a peripheral velocity of 50 m/sec (164 ft/sec) and hence a 50 m/sec exit velocity is produced in my suction-turbine, which corresponds to a geological head of pressure of 500 metres (1,640 ft). At 1 litre (0.264 gal) of water/sec, QxH/100 = 5.4 hp/ sec per nozzle and second, where Q = quantity of heat and H = mech anical equivalent of heat. With 10 nozzles = 10 litres /sec (2 .64 gal/sec), 54 hp / sec are produced, if these 10 litres (2.64 gal) of water are merely cooled by l°C/sec (1.8°F/sec), for which only about 0.25 hp are required to provide the required impulse. In this suction- turbine any desired quantity of water ca n be cooled in a matter of seconds by 1 Implosion statt Explosion, a book about Schauberger's theories, self- published by Leopold Brandstatter circa 1954. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Last Letters from Viktor Schauberger 199 at least 10°C (18°F), say from +15°C (+59°F) down to +4°C (+39.2°F). In this way on average a drop in temperature is produced in the same order of magnitude as the rise in temperature in an ordinary vacuum cleaner, which is driven by archimedean pressure-propellers. Using a radius of 50 cm (20 in) and a circumference of about 315 cm (126 in) for calculation, then already at 1,000 rpm an effective force is produced equivalent to that required to drive a modern express train. To accelerate it to 80 kph (50 mph), for which about 6,000 hp are required today, I only need about 3 hp/sec as an impulsive force. In my water or air suction-turbine neither air-resistance (sound barrier), nor a thermal barrier exists, because the forelying air-masses are sucked in at th e speed of lightning and re-converted into water. The effectiv e power therefore rises quite astronomically, if for example about 30,000 litres (1,059.44 ft 3 ) of fore-lying air are screwed inwards in seconds and re-converted into about 30 litr es (7.92 gal) of water. For all this about 3 hp are necessary. By examining the relevant tables showing the reduction in volume that occurs with the conversion of air into water, one can get an idea of the magnitude of the negative pressure that evolves when about 30,000 litres (30 m 3 - 1,059.44 ft 3 ) of air are re-converted into a homogenous water precipitate within seconds. If the reverse calculation is made, then it can be seen what force is needed to transform 30 litres (7.92 gal.) of water into a gaseous, aeri- form state within seconds. In this regard, if the additional air-resistance encountered by a train at 80 kph (50 mph) is taken into account, then it can be seen how stupidly we deceive ourselves and uselessly squander a vast number of kilocalories to produce the re quisite steam pressure to drive such a train at 80 kph (50 mph). With my system, however, only about 3-6 hp would be needed to transform air into water. About a third of the 27 patents I have been applied for have been granted. The other countries have been assessing them for about 4 years, and will have to capitulate once I demonstrate the im proved suction-turbine to them, for owing to their techno-academic educa tion they simply cannot understand the differences. And the same also applies to you, since you too learnt precisely the opposite at school. You must therefore also be patient until you have seen how media of all kinds can be accelerat ed naturalesquely without resistance, wherein the resistance to motion pr oduced by all technical machines is converted into additional power. It would therefore serve no purpose were you to act against established science prematurely, because science will become ridiculous once the exact opposite has been proven. I therefore sugg est that you continue to be patient for the short time that I require in or der to place a fully functional suction- turbine on the lecture table at the next series of lectures to trained bio- ecotechnologists."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"200 The Energy Evolution At the moment I also have no time for any more detailed theoretical ex- planations, because work on the turbin e, which is proceeding apace, demands my full attention. Very soon the moment awaited with much excitement will come, when turbine manufacturers will have been initiated to the point where they will reproach themselves for having made such a stupid mistake, namely for having produced a rising temp erature-gradient in lieu of a falling one, and therefore recognise the self-deception that lies rooted in today's flawed teaching methods. Please understand that it is for these reasons that I must decline any further theoretical explanations. I wish you a good New Year, which will bring the turning point that everyone has so anxi ously awaited, because things simply cannot continue the way they have thus far. As a result there will no longer be any need to fight against those who so far believed they could build up a healthy economy or even a culture with the use of fire. Such a turning point I experienced during the days at the above turbine-works, when the director capitulated completely once he underst ood the difference between falling and rising temperature-gradients. Excerpts from Letter No. 2 to Josef Brunnader Written in Linz, 15/6/1956 Thank you for your nice letter. That you haven't heard from me for a while was because I've been extremely busy with the construction of an improved home-power generator. (see fig. 34) As a result of experiments with the first two models, possibilities for their improvement and simplification emerged which were quite surprising, which I will tell you about in more detail in the near future. This will be from Germany, where I am making more rapid progress, because there water scarcity is looming increasingly threateningly and therefore the authorities will be forced to make drastic changes. Indeed, in this whole sphere little can be done without compulsion. Future home-power generators will use a falling (regenerating) thermal gradient entirely. Interestingly enough , in scientific circles nobody knows of the vast differences that exist between regenerating (refreshing, cooling), and rising and degenerating thermal gradients. By means of the latter, decent rul- ing reactive forces are activated from the true sediments which contain bipolar trace-elements. These act to decompose water.

The factor that has been overlooked is the bipolarity - the potential differences - through which the origin al, causal motion or stimulus is triggered off. If one now considers that today coal, oil, wood, pressure-turbines, etc., exploit the rising, degenerating ther mal gradient and therefore unwittingly generate atomic decomposive forces from the above trace-elements, then it becomes quite evident that throughout the whole chain of evolution cancerous regression will gain sway. The true trace-elements function like fever- reducing medicines, if they are regenerated with the aid of a falling thermal gradient. However, if in any form of motion the rising, degenerating temperature-gradient prevails owing to the supremacy of centrifugence, (e.g, pressure-turbines, expansion and expl osion machines), then the above concentrates of reduced matter act as a poison. 3 As this finding can be proven, the very foundation of modern science has been completely undermined, since from this point of view science is the true instigator of cancer. You can imagine what effect this realisation had in Germany, the ever-alert land of the best technologists. Major in dustries sent their best specialists and experts, who were unconditionally forced to admit the tragic error, and to realise that techno-academic methods of motion must be immediately prohibited by law, otherwise no recovery is possible. For if the last remnants of water are decomposed due to the e ffect of degenerative reactive forces, then the consequences are truly unforeseeable. Recently the Daily Sketch reported that the first English atomic powerstation had to be shut down because of an im pending lack of water. Similar reports have come from America, where whole areas a drying out and dust-storms are transforming thousands of farms into wasteland. For the first time it is now being realised that the practical implementation of Einstein's atomic energies for peaceful purposes is even more dangerous that the enormous consumption of wa ter for today's industrial purposes. And now, as the best hope for a recovery, the League for Human Rights is going to champion my all-revolutionising discove ry of how to generate a falling, regenerating thermal gradient. To aid in this recovery, regenerated carbonic acid - the best mountain springwater - can be produced in exactly the same way that it happens in Nature, provided the thermal gradient is present that builds up the concentrating reactive fo rces prevailing in naturalesquely conserved forests.

Excerpts from Letter No. 3 to Josef Brunnader Written in Linz 20 /10 /1956 Thank you for your letter of the 18th a nd many thanks too for the wine you sent me for my 71st birthday. I was not able to thank you earlier, because I had lost your address. What I already foretold 30 years ago has now come to pass. If humanity does not come to its senses at this fina l hour, then the ve ry next generation will have to dig for water as hitherto has been dug for gold. The same applies to the realm of energy resources. After a 6-year battle for Patents, the officials at the Patent Office have finally had to give in. Meanwhile I have built the 4th model of the suction-turbine (see fig. 34) and have developed the air-turbine (see fig. 35) to the extent that in prin ciple no further basic development work is necessary. On the whole I can state after 40 year s of research that modern science, founded on precepts and principles going back as far as Moses, was either a tragic error or a deliberate falsificati on in order to keep the broad mass of humanity in a state of virtual ignorance, for only the stupid or uncondition- ally dependent are easily governed. I have now reached the point where with the aid of a falling - regenerative - thermal gradient, I can achieve a nine -fold increase in performance compared to equivalent conventional mechanical systems. The latter make use of a rising - degenerative - thermal gradient exclusively, thereby reaping a resist- ance to motion, which increases by the s quare of the velocity at which the above temperature rises."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"204 The Energy Evolution Fig. 35: Possible air-turbine design If the process is reversed - centripetal forces predominate instead of centri- fugal - then per kilocalorie and second about 5.7 hp in additional output is obtained, because in this case the calorific elements inhering in the media of"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Last Letters from Viktor Schauberger 205 water and air - so-called 'chromosomes' 4 - are transformed into mechanical power, or in the former case into reactive resistances to motion.

If things are carried out unnaturally therefore back to front, then in accordance with inner na tural law no advance is possible, but only cancerous regression. It is the evolutionally older, the risi ng generation, who will have to pay for the consequences of the fatal miscon ception of a science founded on rigid, morbid logic. They will never perceive the error, however, because it will only take effect indirectly in the 2nd or 3rd links in Nature's biological chain. I have often been reproached for not having made implosion technology freely available. Many believe that I know much, but cannot implement what I know practically. In this assumption they err. The reason for my withholding this information goes far deeper. I am convinced that today's leaders of humanity are not stupid enough to ha ve failed to understand how medial masses should be accelerated in order to inhibit the build-up of heat and pressure and hence resistance to motion, which are the obvious result of the expansion of the unnaturall y and inversely moved mass. Without doubt, therefore, there is a definite intention to teach young people upside down methods of working with wh ich they have to mis-earn their daily bread. That is to say, instead of moving forwards, they go backwards all the more rapidly in step with the im provements in the contrary methods of motion. For only thus can today's teaching principles flourish. Were I to make the naturalesque system of mass motion known prematurely and with it a naturalesque and ec onomic (development-enhancing) modus operandi, then the first to get hold of th is implosion principle would be those who have no interest whatsoever in any improved social conditions. They would either be held to to tal ridicule for their hitherto contrary practices, or they would be recognised by their victims as those to blame for this complete economic collapse and therefore punished. In such case, precautionary meas- ures would be taken to ensure that my discovery once again disappeared without trace. There is only one thing that can be done and that is to explain everything to the victims of this self-deceit or general deception for as long as it takes until 4 Chromosomes: Since the 'calorific elements' consis t of substances whose interaction produces heat, i.e. carbone (female) and oxygen (male), the charact eristics of homologous chromosomes seems most likely to be what is intended here; These are de fined as: \"Chromosomes having the same structural features.

It is actually vi a the agency of counter-polarities, which so regulate the differences in potentia l, that an increase or decrease in temperature results. The success or failure of any effectiv e endeavour depends on the possibility of regulating the temperature or thermal gradient. For if with the aid of a falling thermal gradient, 1 kcal is tran sformed into mechanical power in 1 second, then about 5.7 hp in additional power is obtained from the store of so- called 'chromosomes' contained in the above media. On the other hand, if a medial mass is moved techno-academically so as to increase pressure and heat, then decentr ating reactive energies are released from these dynagen concentrates a nd act as resistances to motion. Excerpts from Letter No. 4 to Josef Brunnader Written in Linz, 10/8/1957 Please tell those who are harassing you the following: In 1934 I was subjected to an extremely searching investigation when I told Hitler, who had summoned me by telegramme, that today's heat- and pressure-intensifying technology was the greatest self-deceit of all times and that Germany would be finished if the medial structures of earth, water and air continued to be moved techno-academically, i.e. predominantly centrifugally. In this I was confronted by Privy Counsellor Max Plan ck and other leading lights from the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute to whom I stated the following: In the medial structures of earth, water and air there are trillions of reduced fossils - minute planetary systems. These science calls atoms and trace- elements. Doctors call them chromosom es, but I collectively term them 'ur- cells'. If their carrier (medium) is move d axially->radially by means of a 'tech- nical' shaft or axle, then the pressure in creases by the square of the speed at which heat increases, in other words, by the square of the increase in friction, This heat-form is the lowest form of so-called electricity, which for example decomposes water. If the products of th is dissociation, hydrogen and oxygen, are recombined, then an explosion of oxyhydrogen gas occurs, resulting in a renewed increase in heat. For this very reason progressively intensifying elec- trolyses are continually produced in exactly the same way - even if barely detectable - as occurs when an electri cal current is conducted into water. Water is only the carrier of the above ur-cel l s wherein the real process of decomposition actually takes place."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Last Letters from Viktor Schauberger 207 In the first place the inhalation, th e attraction and insuction of diffuse oxygen is prevented by the increase in pressure. Having a bipolar charge, the ur-cells therefore suffocate, resulting in a reversal of polarity - the so-called Lenard effect 5 - at the level of the basic elem ents. This ultimately leads to the rupture of the cells (miniature explosi ons) and thus to the total disintegration of the ur-source of reproductive, regene rative and multiplying life-forces. As a result trillions of ur-cells putrefy and ultimately whole rivers and seas become polluted due to the emergence of pathogenic life-forms, all of which has been accurately recorded by numerous researchers. All pressure-, friction- and heat-increasing machines, pressure-turbines, agricultural implements, etc. made of paramagnetic materials only are there- fore atom-smashing devices of the first or der. Their effectiveness in this regard intensifies in step with the predominan tly axial->radial (centrifugal) increase in rotational velocity. This also explai ns the nascent resistance to motion in all the above machines, which once again incr eases by the square of the velocity of the above expansive increase in heat. On the other hand, if the media and their ur-cells are moved predominantly centripetally in a radial->axial directi on, then precisely the opposite effects of pole-reversals (naturalesque Lenard effects) occur. These can be measured exactly and trigger an atomic negative pr essure in the vicinity of the ur-cells. Equally capable of accurate measurement, this biological vacuum attracts and in-draws the surrounding stores of oxygen and internally binds (marries) it to the unsaturated nitrogen. The product of this in-spire-ation (ur-procreation) - this emulsion-is a diamagnetic formativ e and uplifting energy. In other words, it is precisely the opposite product of emulsion achieved by contemporary pressure- and fire-engineers. In this case the reduction in the above resistance to motion reduces in inverse proportion to the increase in reproductive and upwardly evoluting energies, which occurs when a falling ther mal gradient is triggered instead of the heat-increasing degenerative rising te mperature-gradient.

Therefore nothing c ould be more stupid than to move planetary systems techno-academically, which increases heat and friction! Is this now clear to you? For with atom-disintegrating devices no further development can be expected, whereas with my atom-transforming machines this is a matter of course. To find ou t how to make the Ur-works function prop- erly again, please study the Austrian patent application over which I have fought a 6-year battle with the sharpest scrutineers of the Patent Office 6 . Like their counterparts in other countries, who took an average of 21 years to make their assessment, they were forced to capitulate and grant me the patents. Excerpts from Letter No. 5 to Josef Brunnader Written in Linz, 5/10/1957 Recently some Englishmen came to visit me in order to make a closer study of the natural production of life-force that arises through the agency of the digestive process. In principle, this bui ld-up of force, which serves to over- come physical and mental heaviness, is the same force that causes the Earth to float in space and provides for its perpetual motion about its diamagnetic longitudinal axis. If the planetary motion of the Earth, water or air is copied, then the build-up of levitational for ces proceeds correctly. This form of motion is also exploited by all types of blood and sap. The ancients called it the 'Eternal Flow' (panta Rhei), th e eternal, cycloid-spiral-space-curve circulation, which is a circular motion within a circle,. The ur-sources of energy are those en ergy-concentrates that modern science calls atoms, trace-elements or chromoso mes. Viewed biologically and accord- ing to their state of being, these are to be understood as the reduced remains of former manifestations of life of all kinds and are also in suspension (float) in water and air in their trillions. According to the type of motion, these are transformed either into pathoge nic or apathogenic life-forms, which collectively are encompassed in the concepts of 'life-affirming' or 'life-negating' forces. The fertilisation of these indifferent - neutrally disposed - ur-cells is engendered by the Sun. In terms of the production of mechani cal force from a biological standpoint, what is important about this primordial metabolic process - the 'Eternal Flow' 6 See description of Austrian Patent No. 196680, p. 105 and \"Processes and Equipment for the Conveyance of Liquid, Gaseous or Aeriform Media\", p. 107 of this book. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Last Letters from Viktor Schauberger 209 - is whether predominantly dia-magnetically or di-electrically supercharged concentrates of dynagen become fr ee and active. This reconstitution of inorganic (reduced) residues of former life into reproductive and upwardly evolving repositories of energy is akin to the manner in which the digestion of undecayed food - fresh cadavers - pr oceeds. This is not only a process of cold combustion, but also one in which the normal build-up of life-force occurs, which is also diamagnetically super-charged and serves to overcome our own physical and mental ponderousness. The important factor in this mechanical production of power is whether the media (carrier substances) containing the inorganic sources of energy - the 'ur-cells' - are made to move predominan tly planetarily or anti-planetarily. By this is meant techno-academically and th erefore pressure-, friction- and heat- intensifyingly. Nature moves the above ur-sources of all life planetarily there- by attaining the 'Golden Middle Way' - a sine-like curve that propagates itself as a (3-dimensional) wave. It is produ ced when centrifugence and centripe- tence mutually amplify one another. U nder such conditions the above 'Eternal Flow of Evolution' is able to take pl ace naturalesquely, because in this process the relatively highest velocity is produ ced. This is akin to the high speed attained by a skier, when making stem turns during the descent. Through such tangential impulses, the centrifugence a ppearing in all motion is continually redirected into the straightest possible direction of travel (see fig. 36). Thus the development of the force here in question is brought about in accordance with the equation - mass x velocity 2 = energy. This is like a river, which makes similar stem turns along its meandering course. Its natural developmental path , however, the modern river-engineer truncates, steepens and shortens, thus ach ieving the opposite effect - excess pressure. This results in a loss of su spended (nutritive) sediment, because it weakens the suctional force. Through the negative pressure associated with this force the provisions for the river's journey - the small particles of The tangential impulses of the stem -turns of skiers and bends in rivers during descent assist in their straight, forward acceleration.

This is because in the advancing tip of the suction- vortex swirling about its own axis, the relatively strongest centripetal forces prev ail, which act to bore out the path in front of it. If any given flow - a flow of electrical current for example - is natural- esquely regulated, then the so-called 'Ohms Law' 7 no longer applies, because such a flow inwinds almost without an y generation of heat (super-conductors) and follows the almost loss-less path of the 'Golden Middle Way'. If such a current flow - water for example - is braked by the resistance from the inclined blade of a pressure-turbine, who se angle of attack can be varied to maximise the effect of centrifugal force, then the resistance to flow increases by the square of the expansive increase in h eat thus arising. This occurs precisely because the braking blade is made of paramagnetic alloys. In this case di- electric, decomposive energies evolve from the aforementioned trace- elements (ur-cells). These ur-cells are su spended in their trillions in water and air and await the motive in-pulse in or der to transform themselves into an octave higher, 4th or 5th dimensional im plosive force, which is nevertheless of corpuscular nature. In this instan ce the levitational, formative and up- suctional, atomic force develops, which the medium accumulates and elevates in order to conduct these reproductive and evolutionally uplifting atomic energies into the interior of th e plants by way of diffusion. Through the subsequent interaction of these ener gies with atmospheric influences, pre- cisely that product of emulsion comes in to being, which also endows plants with increased driving force or growth energies. However, if instead of negative pressu re, positive pressure prevails through the implementation of light-induced grow th (the exposure of heat-sensitive, shade-loving trees to light and heat), th en the structure becomes enlarged due to the abnormally high di-electri c forces. Spongy heart-wood and hence genetically defective - red- and white-rot ridden wood - wood cancer is the biological and hence obvious sequel, because heat is the lowest form of the electrical decomposive force. The same mistake is made throughout the whole chain of evolution through the disturbance of the 'Eternal Flow'. It is therefore really and truly no wonder that the whole process of growth and development will fall victim to cancerous regression, if any medium is moved unnaturalesquely - techno-academically = pressure-, friction- and heat- intensifyingly. This insane form of mass- motion is therefore the true instigator of cancer, because it is itself the seed of 7 Ohm's law: \"The statement due to G. S. Ohm in 1827 that the electr ical potential difference across a conductor is proportional to the current flowing through it, the constant proportionality being known as the resistance of the conductor.

This seed is then transferred to all more highly evolved forms of life through the consumption of contaminated water, food and polluted air. Here too, therefore, all that is needed is an additional mechanical, physical or mental (di-electric) motive or stimulating impulse to raise the scourge of this abortive techno-academic age to an acute condition. Excerpts from Letter No. 6 to Josef Brunnader Written in Linz, 15 /1 /1958 Your letters and activities always give me a great deal of pleasure. What I cannot understand, however, is that you are trying to teach four professorial assistants from the Technical University in Vienna how to do things better. You overlook the fact that implosi on-technology will signal the end of pressure- and fire-technology upon which the existence of these four young academics is founded. These fire-apostles would lose their livelihoods if this self-deceit and betrayal of the public we re to be replaced by meta-technology. Recently I had a very disturbing experience. As you know the blind, deaf and arm-less physicist, Burghard Heim, has been occupied for years with the problem of propelling rockets with light-rays. Not long ago I had a visit from his co-worker, Dipl. Ing. Peter Goslich, an aircraft designer - a very sympathetic and intelligent young man of about 30. For years and very unselfishly he has supported his frie nd Heim's efforts unpaid and he sought my advice as to whether these efforts coul d be expected to be successful in the future. I said the same thing to him that I said to Dr. Martin, namely, that light-rays act more and more diffractively and motion-impedingly, the further they are from their source - the cl oser they approach the Earth. It is upon this property that growth is actually based. Seen from a natural- esque point of view, this is to be unders tood as the re-solidification of what is unsuitable or unusable for the purposes of the next, higher and further develop- ment. This has to be expelled and is cond emned to vegetate further, so that no genetically harmful matter is incorporated in the further evolution of the fit. These 'fit' entities, which are capable of resurrection, are products of re- duction, i.e. earthly remains of former lif e. Purified by the planetary motion of the Earth, these are forms of emanation - those diamagnetically supercharged earth-rays called 'Od rays' 8 - which become bound by geospheric water. 8 Od rays: \"Od was a hypothetical force held by Baron von Reichenbach (1788-1869) to pervade all Nature, manifesting itself in persons of sensitive temperament (streaming from their fingertips), and exhibited specially by magnets, crystals, heat, light and chemical action; it has been held to explain the phenomenon of mesmerism and animal magnetism.

It is the separation of the carrier of these formative and uplifting energies, which cannot exist without a certain physical corporeality, that supplies the root-tip protoplasms (see fig. 15). These only permit the entry of the highest qualities to the interior of the plant as happens in similar fashion in our own bodies through the diffusion of digested, nutritive ethericities into the bloodstream. In this instance as in the other, the supply of diffuse ethericities of the air takes place, the so-called re- spire-ation of those geospherically super-charged microzymes, which the doctor defines as red blood cells. These smallest concentrates of dynagen interact with the oppositely-charged cells - the so-called white blood cells, Everything in Nature happens indirectly . The product of this ultimate inter- action between fundamental elements, is life itself, which arises anew with every intake of breath by way of naturalesque molecular interaction. However, if the media (the carriers of life) of water and/or air are moved techno-academically - pressure-, friction- and heat-intensifyingly - then pre- cisely the opposite molecular recombination occurs and with it an unnatural process of emulsion. The product of this is a repulsive (regressively developing) de-centrating (dispersing) and therefor e a decidedly destructive energy, which becomes bound in the weakest organisms and inaugurates malformed growth, or the loosening or coarsening of the st ructure. This is more commonly called cancer, or in a narrower sense, 'leukaemia' or 'anaemia', which quickly promotes the decay of the red blood cells - diam agnetically supercharged energy con- centrates - to the benefit of the carriers of decomposive energy. The same thing happens in over-illu minated, shade-demanding timbers and other forms of growth, and above all in the physically first-born - water, which contains trillions of microzymes. Considered from a more universal standpoint, it is in this way that the d ecay of water, sap and blood is triggered off, whose germs are transferred to the next higher forms of evolution through the consumption of genetically impaired water and food. After this a slight mechanical, physical or psychic stimulating impulse is all that is required to bring the scourge of this techno-academically, developmentally deformed age to an acute state. Therefore any over-illumination or over- heating of the blood, sap or blood of the Earth - water, causes the relapse of the same and from this point of view the techno-academic movement of medial entities is the true cause of cancer.

For this reason one cannot make use of what serves to shape the Vegetative fo r purposes of primordial motion. In a word, in an upward direction a falling thermal gradient prevails (positive temperature-gradient) and in a downward direction a rising thermal gradient predominates (negative temperature-gradient). Hence in conformity with inner natural law, cancerous regression must ensue, if the rising thermal gradient is used to create forces that are supposedly uplifting. Dr Martin makes the same mistake, substituting th e primary for the secondary. Hence he is also chasing a phantom although from another point of view he is right. Electricity, whose lowest form is heat, comes into being when the microzymes of the air, or their carrier, are moved predominantly centrifugally (see dynamo - fig. 37). If this medium is moved in exactly the opposite way, i.e. predominantly centripetally, then diamagnetism comes into being, because in this case the falling thermal gradient is activated.

They have to chirrup to the same old tunes or go to the dogs. How therefore can you expect any successful outcome to your efforts from such mentally castrateted individuals, where their very existence is in question? Electricity and magnetism are higher octaves of pressure and suction respect- ively, and symbolise bipolarity as such. The interplay between these two polarities determines the life and death of what has been imbued by either. Excerpts from Letter No. 7 to Josef Brunnader Written in Linz, 1/4/1958 For years the Austrian Patent Office has disputed the novelty of a system of pipes that eliminates pressure, friction a nd an increase in heat almost entirely. This movement and the simultaneous coo ling of medial structures at equally high velocities can be achieved, thr ough which the introduced gases can also be liquefied. Up to now this could on ly be done with extremely expensive high-pressure (viz. liquid air). The product of such liquefaction - liquid air - is highly explosive. Precisely the opposite can be achieved through the displacement of the centre of gravity into the axis. In the process a suctional force evolves, whose suction-tip accelerates ahead, producing a cooling effect. For every 1°C (1 .8°F) cooled the volume of the moved mass is reduced by 1/273rd. The result of this specific densation of medial structures or introduced gases, is a water-like liquid, which functions implosively and generates an atomic negative pressure. This effect can be intens ified at will and is also the best and cheapest form of mechanical power. I have called it a 'biological vacuum', which is unknown to science. This utterly new principle for generating mechanical power has therefore remained incomprehe nsible. It is a principle that serves the build-up of the levitational force, which counteracts gravitation and enables the force of gravity to be overcome naturalesquely. Since every body loses weight in proportion to the degree to which it is displaced by a specifically densifying medium, it is to this phenomenon that the true stationary trout owes its almo st absolute freedom of movemen, and is accelerated forward and upwards like a plum-stone, when squeezed between index finger and thumb.

This results in the forward and upward squeezi ng of a tear-drop-shaped foreign body through the sudden densation (liquefaction of the bipolar gas content) of the medium surrounding it. This is to be contrasted with the specific de-d ensation (rarefaction) that occurs, when medial structures are moved in a pressure-, heat- and friction-increasing fashion - techno-acad emically. In this case the medium surrounding the foreign body expands and the body falls through it (see fig. 38b). From this not only can the effects pr oduced by a rising thermal gradient now be understood, but also why tremendous forces are required to counter- act this specific de-densation of the surrounding medium. In other words, counter-forces nearly nine times as strong have to be produced in order to overcome the effects of this erroneous form of motion, which increases the heaviness of a foreign body such as an aeroplane for example. \"If the 'surrounding' has the same density as the 'surrounded', then there is neither gravitation nor levitation.

Letter to Mr 'R' From Implosion Magazine, No. 82, written in Linz, 4th February 1958. Dear Mr R, Thank you for your two letters and en closures. You conceive the matter to be much simpler than it actually is. Above all, you overlook the fact that it concerns the whole of contemporary, t echnological science, which believes it can correct Nature and without exception exploits a rising energy gradient. In so doing, it triggers reversed processes of molecular transformation and fosters the build-up of decomposive ener gies, instead of generating the repro- ductive and ennobling products of emulsion. The culmination of this tragic, abortive development was the fissile atomic energy of Einstein. Thirty eight years ago as I was building the first log-flume and mixed and moved the water in such manner as to trigger a falling thermal gradient, I had no inkling that this was the initial stag e in the build-up of a concentrating form of atomic energy. Acting purely intuitively I proceeded further along this course. In 1921 I built the first su ction-turbine to provide and light my remote forest-homestead with electricity. 10 With it I achieved an almost nine- fold increase in output. This I deemed to be the most natural thing in the world and once again took the next further step. I utilised this falling thermal gradient for the purposes of re-converti ng polluted water into noble water - akin to that of high-altitude springs.

As time went by I took out over 70 patents, but not being much of a businessman, I was unable to exploit them 10 See Jet Turbine Patent (No. 117749) in The Water Wizar d, Vol. I of the Ecotechnology series, p. 206. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Last Letters from Viktor Schauberger 217 commercially. Eventually the doctors and pharmacists became aware of these mysterious healing successes. Just as they did Priessnitz and Kneipp, they accused me of charlatanry and one day the Austrian State Police appeared and confiscated my apparatus. I then went to Nuremberg, where a laboratory had been placed at my disposal. There I discovered that what I was actually concerned with were emanations with different functions. Th ere are pure rays, which animate and enliven. There are also types of rays that debilitate, and lastly there are indifferent rays, which serve to build up or decompose water (see fig. 23 & figs. 2-3). The first are released from so-called microzymes when water moves under a falling thermal gradient. The second are activated when water moves under a rising thermal gradient, wherea s the former build up the corporeal elements, which bind one thing with another. From that moment I recognised the erroneous form of motion employed by the whole of science and exposed it for wh at it was. On doing so, I stumbled into a veritable hornet's nest and began to feel the full force of the omni- potence of my scientific adversaries. I was challenged to provide proof. Whenever I did this, I was robbed to such an extent that there was no other course was open to me other than to remain silent once more. In the February issue of 'Weltgewissen' you will be able to read that these devices, which the Austrian State Police took from me, ar e now being manufactured in Germany with enormous success. This has happened to me twelve times. Every time I had something fabricated, all I was give n were the leftovers, while the best part was retained and exploited comme rcially by others. Or the apparatus was never made public (see the suction-tu rbine), although I had paid all the agreed development costs myself. S ubsequently such large sums were demanded of me, which lay far beyond my capacity to pay, and the machines I was struggling to build were withheld as security against payment. I then began to work covertly and in this way succeeded in producing workable machines. I then first beca me aware of what I had discovered, namely higher-grade atomic energies. At this stage \"Demonstrate it!\", \"Prove it!\", \"Let it be examined!\" was and is al ways demanded. If I concur, then all is lost. If I do not, however, then I am a fraud. 'M' requested that I show the gadget to him and some of his friends and that I hand over the patents to the VSB, otherwise he would cancel the public demonstration. \"Do it then !\", I replied. Whereupon he withdrew his threats. Then along came a major German industr ialist with his scientific advisors. He investigated the process and found it in order. Statements were made expressing readiness to proceed with fa brication and cost evaluation and then, yes, then one will just have to wait and see. All they are, are empty promises, never kept.

My dear Mr R, I have now reached the point where they can all kiss the place where my spinal column terminates. I am old and seriously ill. My only concern now is for all the poor children, who are faced with a grisly future.

All power-politics will collapse once the truth emerges that science is the actual causative agent of cancer.

I intend to return to the forest once more, there to die in peace. The whole of science and all its hangers-on, are nothing but a band of thieves, who are suspended like marionettes and must dance to whatever tune their well-camouflaged slave-masters deem necessary. In this situation only a frightful catastrophe may perhaps bring about order. In the achieve- ment of such generalised order at least 90% of humanity will fall victim. They will perish because of water and blood decomposition (cancer). The final victory will be achieved by the Russians, who are closer to Nature and who, according to the Pfalzer Tageblatt of th e 14th January 1957, are nearest to the overcoming of gravity. This, however, will only be understood by the West when it is already too late. You, Mr R, are still young and will live to see this. I know it, but can do nothing to change it myself.

Ing. Walter SCHAUBERGER, Bad Ischl, Engleithen, Austria. 2.0 The object of the negotiations was th e comprehensive complex of themes and questions concerning:- 2.1 Water supply and its scientific and technical problems. 2.2 A paper of Viktor Schauberger's, with particular reference to his previous research findings, developments, projects and the performance oi completed projects in the sphere of near-natural hydraulic engineering, including a number of observations, e xplanations and assertions concern- ing agriculture, forestry, water and energy supply. 2.3 A short paper of Walter Schauberger's concerning non-Euclidean (Gauss) concepts in Nature, the basic assertions of quantum physics, and facts incorporated in the Theory of Relativity, which taken altogether, emphasise the centripetal dynamics of Nature's energetic and resonant processes with their universal sphere of action. 2.4 Professor Popel made a statement opposing Viktor and Walter Schauberger's statements and opinions. He expressed the view that the crucial areas of technology were founded on the legitimacy of classical mechanics and hence the laws govern ing the flow of liquids and gases should also be dealt with from this point of view. Moreover, it had like- wise been determined that in hydrau lic engineering optimal results had been achieved with Euclidean elements . He could therefore state at the outset that Schauberger's desired investigation of such pipes, would achieve no useful results for technolo gy. Also, in view of the relatively high costs to Schauberger arising fr om such investigations, he asked permission to withdraw from this task. 2.5 Kumpf agreed unreservedly with Pr ofessor Popel's opi nion and added that Bonn was interested in this scientific inves tigation inasmuch as it would at last put a stop to Viktor Schauberger's unqualified attacks, which were directed primarily agai nst the sphere of water resources management. Bonn would therefore ma ke some financial contribution towards the costs of the investigation. 2.6 Thereupon Professor Popel declared that his institute would carry out the various investigations on straight a nd rifled helical pipes and that the results of the investigations could be expected in about two month's time, Viktor Schauberger's request that his son, Dipl. Ing. Walter Schauberger, be present at these important series of tests, was accepted by Professor Popel. 2.7 The scope of the investigation and its subsection concerning the format of the series of experiments and the catal ogue of questions to be settled, was fixed. This referred, with significant reductions however to the complex of questions, namely points 1 to 5 quoted in the investigation report. 2.8 In point 6, the crucial area which Scha uberger stressed and wished to be settled, namely 'Technical hydraulic engineering and its destructive"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"The Popel Report 221 consequences', was on the one hand de ferred by Prof. Popel, and on the other, rejected by Kumpf as serving no purpose. Point 6 was concerned not only with the specifically targetted formulation of questions, attempts at interpretation and facts, but also empirically substantiated findings. These concerned such aspects as:- (a) That to the most massive intrusions into Nature's biological balance, must be added the purely mechanical correction of river embank- ments. (Proof: The regulation of the Rhine, Danube and other 'hard- edged' rivers and streams. (b) That despite the consequential dama ge occurring everywhere due to this unnatural and therefore incorrect regulation of watercourses, why is this practice still continued? (c) That indisputable evidence (and these are not merely assertions or opinions) show unmistakably, that the execution of such erroneous corrective measures in relation to em bankment works, i.e. mechanical methods of regulation, results in an even more drastic sinking of the watertable, a far more widespread drying up of springs and the increasing disappearance of water. (d) That a farm report (Third Reich) dated 4th of February 1939 indicated that the repercussions due to the vanishing of the watertable had become so evident, that development of steppe-land over large areas was greatly to be feared. The already projected re-routing of rivers mentioned in this report and their attendant dams for the storage of irrigation water, would only accelerate steppe-development and desertification. (e) The smallest causes have unforeseen effects in Nature. (f) The warming up of water through unnatural motion and containment leads to the loss of its carrying capacity and tractive force, and in further consequence, to its disappearance. (g) Despite its slow rate of flow (mea nder), naturally flowing water has a greater carrying capacity and tractiv e force, which decrease, however, with steep, technically contrived gradients. (h) Nothing is more absurd than to intensify the geological gradient by a shortcut, because in such instances, due to its own weight, the water throws itself out of its course and the preconditions for natural motion diminish. (i) Hydraulic engineers have neglected: • the interplay between the tractiv e force and the carrying capacity of water • the normal profile arising spontaneously from a bio-dynamic form of motion"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"222 The Energy Evolution • the rotation of water about its own axis, which again is the result of a normal profile. • the proper insulation (from heat, Sun, etc.) through the natural placement and deposition of the layers of sediment. (j) The natural regulation of a wate rcourse is never possible through mechanistic restructuring or realignment of the riverbank. (k) Water, sap and blood are all accumulators and transformers in which analyses and syntheses constantly take place. These further intensify, the more water, sap and blood are cau sed to move in a natural way. In the course of this, the outer velocity has almost no effect, whereas the inner balancing velocity plays a very important role. (1) The origins of carrying and tractive power, at otherwise equal velocities, lie in the water's inner metabolic processes. (m) Quantity can be transformed into quality. This requires a corres- ponding organisation of the material, in form as well as in qualitative relationship. Dipl. Ing. Walter SCHAUBERGER Report Concerning the Prelimi nary Investigation of Helicoid Pipes with Various Shapes of Pipe-Wall carried out at the Institute of Hygiene at the Stuttgart University of Technology, Germany. Director: Prof. Dr. - Ing. habil. Franz Popel. During negotiations on the 9th of Febr uary 1952 the Biotechnical Study Group made various prototypes of straight and spiral helicoid pipes of different materials available to the Institute of Hygiene at the Stuttgart University of Technology in order to clarify fundamentally the following problems: 1. Can water be brought into a multiple in-winding, convoluting, spiral motion when flowing through pipes? 2. Does the form of the conducting pipe play a decisive role in the attain- ment of this convoluting motion? 3. Does the material of the pipe play a decisive role in achieving this in- winding spiral motion? 4. Do changes in the molecular structur e of the water occur during this in- winding flow process? 5. Could these in-winding flow processes be u t i l i s e d in the prevention of pipe-encrustation?"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"The Popel Report 223 To Question 1: The Multiple In-Winding, Convoluting Flow Process. If water containing coarse suspended matter is first stirred around in a glass beaker and afterwards left to rotate by itself, then the su spensions concentrate themselves in the axis of the rotating cy linder of water caused by the stirring. This well-known natural phenomenon is al ready being evaluated technically in the circular sand-capture machine by the Geiger Company, Karlsruhe and in the 'Hydro-Cyclone' of the Stami-Carbon Company for the separation of suspensions from water. In both cases the contents of the circular containers is caused to rotate by the tangential s upply of the liquid, which can be con- sidered to be the cause of the self-ord ered concentration of suspended matter in the axis of the vertically rotating cylinder of liquid. However if water is conducted from a large container into an inlet pipe and is set in a faster or slower rotation above this, a suction f unnel is formed, which is deeper or shallower according to the velocity of flow prevailing in the outlet pipe. Attentive observers can often watch the fo rmation of such vortexial funnels at the outlets of basins and baths. The spiralling of the water in the pipe, evolving from the inlet in the direction of the outlet pipe and the forward motion of the water in the outlet pipe itself, now generate as a result of these reciprocal influences, a flow-through process composed of the simultaneously combined effects of several 3-dimensional space-curves, which can be made visible in the following manner. Water flows from a vessel with a co nstantly maintained water level (levelling vessel) into a glass pipe of 40 mmOID 1 and onwards by means of a rubber hose of 19 mmOID to an overflow. Whereas in Test Stand 1 (Diagram 1) the levelling vessel and the water suppl y were so arranged that only a very weak spiralling motion at the inlet of the observation pipe was able to develop, in the case of Test Stand 2 (Dia gram 2) the build-up of spiral motion was intentionally assisted by the trumpe t-like form and a tangential inflow of water. The 40 mmOID test pipe with a flow section of 0.125 dcm 2 was supplied with a quantity of water between 0.2 and 0.21 litres/sec, so that this would flow through at a calculated velo city of 1.6 to 1.68 dcm/sec. This already lies within the region of turbulen t flow. A thin silk thread, weighted at the end, hanging straight down into the test pipe at a state of rest, was set 1 To aid readers unfamiliar with the metric system of measurement and to avoid over-complicating an already complex text by inserting Imperial or US equivalents, the following correspondences have been provided by the editor: 1 litre (1) = 0.22 imp. gallons = 0.26 US gallon 1 millimetre (mm) = 0.03937 inches 1mm 2 = 0.00155 in 2 1mm 3 = 0.00006102 in 3 1centimetre (cm) = 0.3937 inches 1 cm 2 = 0.155 in 2 1 cm 3 = 0.06102 in 3 1 decimetre (dcm) = 3.937 inches 1 dcm 2 = 15.5 in 2 1 dcm 3 = 61.02 in 3 1 metre (m) = 39.37 inches (3.28ft) 1 m 2 =10.764 ft 2 1 m 3 = 35.315 ft 3 "},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"224 The Energy Evolution Diagram 1"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"The Popel Report 225 in a slow rotation corresponding to a slightly convoluted 3-dimensional space- curve by the flow of water through the pipe. In Test Stand 2 the curvature of the thread was greater than in Test St and 1, due to the greater spiral motion at the inlet. Since apart from this, it was observed that fine hydrophobic suspensions, very evenly dispersed ove r the water surface with the aid of a finely meshed sieve, were concentrated into little clusters along the 3- dimensional space-curve denoted by the th read, it is thus demonstrated that a flow in the pipe is developed, whic h follows a 3-dimensional spiral curve and simultaneously rotates about the axis of this space-spiral. (Proof: Curvature and rotation of the silk thr ead.) This is also confirmed by the fact that the air entrained by the water becomes concentrated along the 3- dimensional space-spiral in the pipe a nd which, according to the size of the air bubbles in the rotating flow of the water about the space-spiral, either accompanies the water or rises upwards again. In order to be able to examine this multiple in-winding flow more closely, the behaviour of three silk threads, each suspended from the corner of an equilateral triangular spacer-block, w as investigated. Although the position of these threads was fixed by spacers at the middle and at the lower end as well, an entwining of the three threads could be observed, when water flowed through the pipe. In addition, the th reads in this new arrangement were always forced into the region of the 3-dimensional space-spiral axis, despite their weighting and spacers. Due to the greater combined stiffness of the three entwined threads, which were even mo re encumbered than the single thread by their spacers and three end-weights, their curvature was naturally some- what less than in the case of the single thread. In order to check whether the entwining of the three threads was not me rely attributable to the rotation of the spacers caused by the rotation of the water at the inlet, the spacers were removed from the middle and the bottom. In this instance too, the entwining of the three threads and their alignment along a slightly curved space-spiral was achieved. It is thus clearly demonstrated, that the entwining of the threads cannot be ascribed to the rotation of the uppermost spacer, but only to the multiple in-winding flowing motion of the water. This multiple in-winding flow process inside the pipe is superimposed by a second equally space-spiral-like, curvin g, peripheral motion as well. This phenomenon was made visible with the aid of iron filings. It was noticeable, that during the flow-through of the water in the pipe, the pitch of the strongly curved space-spiral is not constant, but gradually becomes greater and at the same time a concentration in larger agglomerations takes place. These flow processes, which superimpo se each other in pipes and which have been detected for the first time with the aid of the demonstrative experi- ments described above, must still be thoroughly investigated in relation to their formation and effect."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"226 The Energy Evolution Diagram 2"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"The Popel Report 227 Were only centrifugal forces here active, then the silk thread hanging down the centre ought to have been drawn to wards the exterior. Also such forces could never bring about an entwining of the threads along the weakly curved space-spiral. Moreover it would be impossible for centrifugally acting forces to twist the three silk threads suspended in the outer zones of the pipe into a single thread, which then further accomm odates itself to the space-spiral-like curved axis. These phenomena can only be brought about by centripetally acting forces greater than the centrifugal force. The multiple in-winding flow can therefore only be attributed to these centripetally directed forces initiated by the system of flow itself and which have been observed and clearly detected for the first time. In addition, it can be concluded from the variable pitch of the strongly curved space-spiral and by the observed flocculation and migration of the particles of matter in the centre, that the centrifugal forces decrease with the flow-through of water in the pipes a nd the centripetal forces which overcome them are always of the same magnitude and accordingly increase their effect gradually in relation to the centrifugal forces. The detected flocculative processes, how ever, cannot be attributed to the influence of mechanical forces alone. According to prevailing ideas concern- ing the coagulation of solids, it can be assumed with the greatest certainty, that the agglomeration of solid partic les occurring in the course of the flow process, is triggered off by the effects of electro-physical forces. The flowing motion of water in straight pipes, made visible in various ways, thus clearly proves that at the inlet of these pipes a greater or lesser spiralling motion develops, which in turn triggers off an in-winding flow along a space- spiral and which is additionally supe rimposed by flows along more strongly curved space-spirals. To Questions 2 & 3: The Influence of the Form and the Material of the Pipe on the Development of In-Winding Flow Processes. The superimposing flow processes detectable along either a weakly or a strongly curved space-spiral must strongly impede each other through the formation of vortices in the fringe areas of both motions, which differ in direction and velocity of flow. Therefore as a logical conclusion arising from this observation, an increase in the output of the pipe could thus be antici- pated in the instance of a favourable limitation of the mutually impeding flow processes due to vortex formation. Since in their rhythmically oscillating form the helicoid pipes are aligned to the course of the strongly curved space-spirals automatically evolving during"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"228 The Energy Evolution "},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"The Popel Report 229 "},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"230 The Energy Evolution the flow through the pipe, these must therefore have a greater capacity than straight pipes of equal flow section under otherwise identical conditions. If the processes of motion, above and beyond those initiated by the spiral form of the helicoid pipe, are also s ynchronous with the momentum arising from the velocity of the through-flow, then, as in the case of the strongly curved space-spiral in the glass pipe, th e water ought actually to flow through the helicoid pipe in a freely oscillating manner, i.e. without touching the pipe walls and without the formation of flow -impeding and separating vortices. In this case, as a result of the multiple in-winding flow motion, the pipe wall would then hardly be touched by the wa ter at all. From this it would appear as yet a further step towards hypotheti cal conclusions, that under very specific preconditions the frictional losses usually occurring in straight pipes could be reduced to zero in the case of the helicoid pipe. The same hypotheses, however, could also be put forward for the helicoid pipes, which in shape correspond to th e weakly curved space-spirals formed inside the straight pipes and with which the spiralling motion of the water is created by a particular configuration of the pipe walls. This screw-shaped indentation in the pipe walls of the st raight and curved helicoid pipes, how- ever, by virtue of the flow patterns, will not only aid the formation of the in-winding flow process itself, but will also stabilise its actual configuration - as for example in the case of the rifled barrel of a gun. The hypothetical conclusions arising from the flow experiments described under Question 1 above, were checked as to their formal logic by measure- ments of the friction losses and outputs of seven straight or spiral pipes of various cross-section and wall configuration. From the levelling vessel of Test Sta nd 1, the water was conducted to the pipes to be tested by a rubber hose of 19 mmOID. A rubber hose of the same diameter served to further conduct the water towards the measuring outlet. This essentially consists of an outle t pipe, enlarging conically from 20 mmOID to 40 mmOID, with two connections for measuring the drop in pressure (Diagrams 3 & 4). The outlet pipe is positioned centrally in a drain catchment. A stopwatch was used to measure the quantity of water flowing through the pipe by the time required to fill a 15 litre measuring vessel. The head of pres- sure thereby expended, was determined with the aid of three measuring pipes arranged directly adjacent to the measuring outlet. The difference in height h between the water level of the levelling vessel and the outlet pipe were constantly measured. In addition the pressure gradient h was measured, arising from the flow through the outlet pipe itself. The ascertained outputs q are based on the amount of friction and in Diagram 5 are plotted in the form of a graph using a double logarithmical co-ordinate system. In consideration of the various flow sections f of the different test pipes, in this case it w as not the flow-trough velocityv that was"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"The Popel Report 231 graphically depicted in double logarithmical form, but the measured output q based on the measured difference in the heights h of the water levels. The connecting lines of the mutually rela ted measured values, which could be described briefly as q - h lines, would then have to be straight, taking the Weissbach formulation as a basis, for which the relation According to this basic equation the measured values of the pipes of equal flow section and equal roughness of pipe wall must therefore lie along a straight line. In the case of unequal cr oss-sections, however, the values would certainly be displaced by a factor dependent upon 1/f 2 . As is shown in Diagram 5, the q - h lin es of the different test pipes actually deviate very considerably from the stra ight line and exhibit a characteristic oscillating course, as for example in the case of the spiral helicoid copper pipe (Test Pipe 2), concerning which the possibility cannot be ruled out that, as determined, the measured values may not have been ascertained with suffi- cient care. The smooth, straight copper pipes with constant (Test Pipe 3) and conical (Test Pipe 5) flow sections are those wh ich best follow the hydraulic postulate h = c x q 2 . With the other test pipes, apar t from the oscillating course of the curves, the direction of the connecting lines are characterised by a relation in which the exponent of the output q is smaller than 2. For the Test Stand (Test Pipe 1) itself, as well as Test Pipe 2 (spiral helicoid pipe), Test Pipe 4 (straight glass pipe) and Test Pipe 7 (straight conical helicoid pipe - larger cross- section) the exponent would be reduced to 1.67. In the case of Test Pipe 6 (con- ical spiral helicoid pipe) it actually decreases to 1.57 and with Test Pipe 8 (straight, conical helicoid pipe - smaller cross-section) attains the lowest value of 1.51. This permits the conclusi on that the winding and twisting of the pipes can exert either a favourable or an unfavourable influence on the flow- through processes according to the prevailing flow-through velocities. If for example, Test Pipes 6 and 5 are considered, which have the same length and conically shaped flow section, but which differ in relation to their winding and twisting, then the measured value arising from the position of the connecting lines is such, that the winding and twisting of Test Pipe 6 in the area under measurement has an unfavourable effect on its output. The straight, conical copper pipe with smooth walls (No. 5) at equal difference in height of the water levels, delivers mo re water than the helicoid pipe. The difference in the output, however, cons tantly decreases with increasing difference in height and at a value of h = 28 cm, is completely cancelled out. With greater differences in height the helicoid pipe (No. 6) delivers a greater"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"232 The Energy Evolution Diagram 5"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"The Popel Report 233 volume of water than the straight copper pipe (No. 5). The same would also apply to Test Pipe 7, since it would have overtaken the straight, smooth copper pipe (No. 5) at the point where ft = 30 cm with a value of q = 0.17 litres/s. This hypothesis can now be confirmed by the thorough analysis of the measured values of Test Pipes 2, 3 and 4 as corresponding to the facts. The straight glass pipe (No. 4) at an equal difference in height h always has a smaller output than the straight copper pipe (No. 3) and the spiral helicoid copper pipe (No. 2), but up to a difference in height of 10.5 cm Test Pipe 3 delivers more than the spiral helicoi d pipe (No. 2). From here onwards, however, the performance of the spiral helicoid pipe is always superior. The conclusion, which is derived from the direction of the connecting lines of the measured values of Test Pipes 5, 6 and 7 and concerning the favourable effect of the winding and t w i s t i n g of these pipes on the flow-through process lying outside the area of measurement, is therefore proven to be correct in the cases of Test Pipes 2, 3 and 4 by the ascertained measured values. The change from the unfavourable to the favourable effects of the winding and twisting of the pipes on the flow-through process to be anticipated beyond the area of measurement of Test Pipes 5, 6 and 7 in comparison to the straight, smooth pipes, already took place in the case of T est Pipes 2, 3 and 4 within the area of measurement. It is therefore appropriate to submit these test pipes to a thorough analysis. It emerges from the values in Table 1, that the pressure gradients, the dh values at the outlet of the test stand, exhibit no uniform tendency. In order to determine whether the observed deviations are to be attributed to inaccuracies in measurement, the dh values based on the output were plotted in graph form (Diagram 6) in a double logarithmi cal system of co-ordinates. Whereas the connecting lines of the measured values of the straight copper pipe (No. 3) and the straight glass pipe (No. 4) have an even course, those of the spiral helicoid pipe (No. 2) and also of the test stand (No. 1), on the other hand, display characteristic oscillations. The results of these measurements thus prove that the test stand itself, due to its semi-circular, downwardly pendent configuration, triggers off a similar effect to a coiling of the pipe, which however is completely or to the greatest extent annulled by the intervening incorp oration of sections of straight pipe. In the case of the inclusion of the spiral helicoid pipe (No. 2), it is not assumed that the effect of the downward hanging test pipe (No. 1) has been neutralised, but perhaps even further enhanced. Hence, in order to maintain the requisite friction loss in the test pipes required maintain the output q, it is necessary further to reduce the differences in height of the water levels around the pressure gradients present at the ou tlet. In Diagram 7 the outputs q dependent upon the (h - dh) values are plotted on a double logarithmical co- ordinate system."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"234 The Energy Evolution Diagram 6"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"The Pdpel Report 235 TABLE 1 Output of straight and spiral pipes "},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"236 The Energy Evolution The connecting lines of the mutually re lated measured values of the inlet and outlet of the test stand (No. 1), as well as those of the straight glass and copper pipes, now have a more even c ourse than before.

The results of measurement evened out in this way are then used to determine the friction losses of the 1.45 m long test pipes.

It is to be noticed that all the connecting lines exhibit a characteristic oscillating course, which is most clearly pronounced in the case of the spiral helicoid pipe (No. 2). From the configuration of the three curves, it indisputably emerges that with equal amounts of friction, the spir al helicoid copper pipe has a greater output than a straight copper pipe of equal length and flow cross-section. These findings, not to be an ticipated in relation to th e turbulent flow processes currently considered to be correct, how ever can be considered as a confirm- ation of the hypotheses put forward on the basis of the flowing processes evolving in straight pipes, due to th e screw-shaped form of the water inflow and which were addressed in detail in Question 1. With the synchronisation of the speed a nd form of flow of the water with the space-spiral of the spiral helicoid pipe, a decrease down to zero in the amount of friction was factually observed. The total disappearance of friction, how ever, can only then occur, when the kinetic energy of the water flowing in the spiral helicoid pipe and co-acting with the spiralling motion of the same, induced at the inlet or by the rifling of the pipe walls, generates a free spacial oscillation of the water precisely attuned to the coiled configuration of the test pipe. In this connection, however, the cen tripetally directed suctional force arising from the in-winding flowing pro cess also contributes decisively. In relation to the experimental models examined under Question 1, this is actually so strong, that the end-weighted silk threads were formed into a 3- dimensional space-spiral corresponding to the flow process, against the gravitational attraction acting upon them. Whereas the self-same weakly curved flow processes with strong, centr ipetally directed in-winding motion and the strongly curved flow processes with slighter in-winding action, observed in the vertical glass pipe in T est Stand 1, were superimposed in a mutually impeding fashion, both of these centrifugally acting oscillating forces and centripetally acting in-windi ng forces in the spiral helicoid pipe could become united in a mutually supporting harmonic action, when the kinetic energy of the water corresponds to the combined form of the helix and the rifling, through the conduction of the water along a 3-dimensional space- spiral and a screw-shaped pipe wall. In the instance of the spiral helicoid pi pe (No. 2), this was the case with the following outputs and flow velocities. The amount of friction in the spiral helicoid pipe approaches zero when q = 0.14 l/s  or v = 0.28 m/s and when q = 0.19 l/s  or v = 0.39 m/s and when q = 0.38 1/s  or v = 0.60 m/s and when q = 0.46 1/s or v = 0.92 m/s"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"The Popel Report 241 and it reached its highest values when q = 0.127 1/s or v = 0.254 m/s and when q = 0.165 1/s or v = 0.330 m/s and when q = 0.225 1/s or v = 0.430 m / s and when q = 0.360 1/s or v = ...... In Diagram 9, which is a more compre hensive complement to Diagram 8, it is noticeable that the output of both smooth and straight pipes are subjected to a rhythmical oscillation very similar to that of the spiral helicoid pipe. This is presumably to be put down to the spir alling of the water at the inlet of the test stand and to its U-shaped formation. The course of the connecting lines conforming to the measured values even permits the presumption that we are here concerned with two output-related oscillations lying one over the other, which probably arise from the combined action of the torsional motion and the configuration of the test stand. Furthermore it is to be noted, that the q-h line of the straight glass pipe (No. 4) in the output range of 0.13 to 0.20 1/s, fairly precisely follows the curve, which in accordance with the Weissbach pr inciple is satisfied by the relation H=118 x q 2 In the immediately following zone of greater output, though, the q-h line of the glass pipe deviates very marked ly from this fundamental Weissbach equation. The outputs increase much faster with increasing amounts of friction than could be anticipated acco rding to Weissbach's basic law, as a consequence of the in-winding flow pr ocess generated by the spiralling at the inlet and the pendent U-shaped form of the test stand. The lower section of the q - h line for the straight copper pipe runs exactly parallel to that of the glass pipe; it is therefore displaced downwards in relation to the friction level h = 2.5 cm. The friction loss of the copper pipe in the area where q = 0.13 to 0.20 1/s th erefore amounts to only h = 118 x q 2 - 2.5, despite a greater roughness of the pipe walls than the glass pipe,. This reduction in the level of friction when the water flows through the copper pipes can only be explained by the fact, that copper is more favourable to the formation of the in -winding flow process than glass. As was already detected earlier, suctional forces are exerted on the water through this in- winding motion, which lead to the observed reduction in friction. The mag- nitude of this suctional force, theref ore, can now be determined provisionally by means of the very closely associated decrease in friction that must attach itself to the water in the areas of redu ced friction. The in-winding flowing motion generated in the copper pipe produces an adsuctional capacity A, where A = 2,5 q in cm g/s in the lower region of the q - h line and which rises even further with increasing output from 325 to 500 cm g/s."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"242 The Energy Evolution Diagram 10"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"The Popel Report 243 Without erring, it can furthermore be assumed that the Weissbach basic equation for frictional loss in pipes should also apply with outputs greater than 0.2 1/s, if at the inlet to the t est pipes the formation of torsional motion could be prevented. Hence it is possible further to extend the parabola for the friction levels of the form h = 118 x q = 0.2 l/s. The differences in the ordinates between these parabolas and the q - h li nes of the three test pipes, then represent the reduction in the amounts of friction normally applicable and as a consequence of this, can also be defi ned as the amounts of suction that the in-winding flowing motion of the water creates and which, as described above, form the basis for the calculation of the suction capacity. To illustrate these trains of thought, the amounts of suction based on the output were plotted in graph form in Diagram 10. With their aid the suction capacities A were determined, which in Diagram 11 were likewise plotted as q - A curves based on the output. In the case of the glass pipe, the su ction capacity constantly increases towards A = 850 cm g/s up to an output of q = 300 cm 3 /s. The copper pipe, however, under the same delivery volume, now develops a suction capacity of A = 1860 cm g/s. The material of the pipe has thus intensified the suction capacity exerted on the water by 1860 - 850 = 1010 cm g/s. With an output of 310 cm 3 /s the suction capacity of the spir al helicoid pipe reaches its maxi- mum value in the examined area of measurement, where A = 310 x 11.1 = 3450 cm g/s. It is therefore 4.05 times as large as that of the glass pipe and 1.85 times larger than that of the straight copper pipe. The course of the q - h and q - A lines in respect of the three test pipes shown in Diagrams 10 and 11 makes the rhythmical fluctuation of increasing, constant and decreasing amounts of suction with increasing output clearly apparent. In the zones of increasing amounts of suction and suction capacity, the amount of suction arising from the multip le in-winding flowing motion of the water is always greater than the amount of friction to which, according to the Weissbach principle, the normal turbulent flow processes in pipes would give rise. The interpretation and evaluati on of the observations selected above hence also permit the hypothetical conclusion, that the synchronisation of the kinetic energy of the flowing water gene rates more energy due to the spiralling and twisting of the pipes than is re quired to overcome the frictional losses obtaining. A constantly increasing acceleration of the motion of the water would therefore have to occur. This acceleration, however, cannot assume unlimited proportions, since the zones of increasing amounts of suction and suction capacity are repeatedly interrupted by those of constant and decreasing suction capacity. These inter- ruptions only occur, when the optimum synchronisation of all the flow processes is exceeded, leading to the accentuation of the dynamic translatory"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"244 The Energy Evolution Diagram 11"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"The Popel Report 245 component at the expense of the rota tional and oscillatory motions, whereby an asynchronous combined action of the various superimposed kinetic processes comes about. The course of th e curves demonstrates that in the investigated area of measurement, th ese consist of relatively long sections of increasing suction capacity, interrupted by shorter sections of constant and decreasing suction capacity. In the areas of constant amounts of suction and suction capacity, the gain in energy arising from the in-winding flowing motion of the water - corresponding to the observation in the glass pipe - is just as large as the consumption of ener gy, which the normal turbulent flow would cause. The gain in energy however, as in the case of the copper pipe, can also be of a greater constant amount than the normal consumption of energy in turbulent flow processes. In the zones of decreasing amounts of suction and suction capacity, the kinetic energy of the flowing and rota ting water is not synchronised with its oscillating motion. Through this the turbulence of the currents is intensified to the extent that the consumption of energy required to convey the water in the pipes is much greater than the en ergy gain arising from the in-winding motion of the water. Therefore the fact cannot be disregarded, that the representation of the observations in the above form may not reflect reality. It was employed first and foremost in order to obtain an initial overview of the magnitude of the forces capable of giving rise to the phenomenon of the in-winding flowing motion. It must be left to further experiments to understand their magnitude, form and effect more precisely. Sin ce their existence has now become known and their conscious technical applicati on lies within the bounds of possibility, they will be awarded a revolutionising importance in the areas of the han- dling and conveyance of liquid and gaseous media. Since the courses of the q - h, q - H and q - A lines permit the recognition of the superiority of the spiral helicoid pipe vis-a-vis the straight copper pipe and the inferiority of the glass pipe with respect to the latter, Questions 2 and 3 can be collectively answered as follows: The form and the material of the pipes are of decisive importance for the formation of the in-winding flow motion and the suction capacity and amount of suction generated by it. To Question 4: The Structural Change in the Water as a Consequence of the Multiple In-Winding Flowing Motion. Even if no exact measurements can be undertaken concerning the structural changes in the water as a result of the in-winding flow motion, it is very clear"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"246 The Energy Evolution from the experimental models under Question 1, that in straight pipes - even those with flow processes still flowing synchronously - this in-winding flow motion is already capable of giving rise to flocculations, which apart from the mechanical agglomeration of solid matter, must also be attributed to electro- physical effects. The fact established under 2 and 3, that the material of the pipe exerts an extraordinarily large influence on the formation of the in-winding flowing motion of the water, cannot rest on purely hydrodynamic effects alone, but presumably will also have to be ascribed above all to electro-physical effects arising from a greater reactive capacity of copper in its interaction with the water. These conclusions are also confirmed by the observations made in con- nection with the flow process, where silk threads with transverse copper filaments were incorporated and whic h was reported in 1. The darkening effects of the copper filaments, which were not present at a state of rest and which first appeared in the immediate vicinity of the copper filaments under the full motion of the water, indicate a slightly reduced light transmittance of the water at these locations. This decreased light transmittance, however, probably cannot be ascribed to the form of the flow caused by the copper filaments alone. It is to be assumed that here too electro-physical effects co- act, which lead to a localised change in the light transmittance of the water. It is hence quite conceivable that the electro-physical processes detected through the flocculation and increase in the in-winding flow as well as the reduction of light transmittance, are also able to cause structural changes in the water itself. To Question 5: The Prevention of Encrustation. In the answering of Questions 2 and 3, it was determined that water moves itself in a freely oscillating manner in the spiral helicoid pipe, if the kinetic energy of the flowing water is synchronised with the meander of the space- spiral. It can hence be assumed with th e greatest probability, that under these conditions no encrustation of the pipe walls will occur. This should not necessarily also apply in the case wh ere the liquid conducted through the pipe would normally have a tendenc y towards the precipitation of its dissolved salts."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"The Popel Report 247 Stuttgart, the 15th of March 1952 Signed: Popel, Dr. Honoris Causa, Full Professor, Dr. - Eng. habilitatus.
