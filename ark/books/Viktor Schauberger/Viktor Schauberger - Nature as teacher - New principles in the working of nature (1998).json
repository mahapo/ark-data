From reports received almost daily, both nationally and from around the world, we are increasingly forced to become aware of certain life-threateni ng irregularities in the functioning of Nature's household. Record catastrophe s of increasing violence and extent are being reported in almost every count ry; tornadoes, deluges, widespread flooding, searing drought, earthqua kes, unseasonabl e snowfalls and extremes of temperature, all of which ar e associated with huge loss and suf- fering. Strife and starvation are on th e increase, coupled with a seemingly endless emergence of hitherto unheard of diseases. The majority of these existence-threatening events, these so-called 'natural disasters', are not of Nature's making. On the contrary, they are directly attributable to the mis- demeanours of humanity, the result of it s arrogant repudiation or even total ignorance of Nature's sublime laws a nd the subtle interactions between the all-permeating interdependencie s upon which all life is founded. To this catalogue of climatic irregular ity must be added the more directly apparent man-made factors. The world' s river systems and oceans are grad- ually collapsing through pollution with chemicals. Fish and other aquatic life are dying. Other creatures are bei ng threatened with extinction or have already become extinct. The environmental overload is being increased at a precipitous rate through excessive land cl earing, uncontrollable forest fires, the reduction in the quality of light reaching the Earth's surface due to atmospheric pollution, and the saturati on of all living things, down to the smallest cellular organisms, by the cocktail of electromagnetic emissions known as electrosmog. Th is undoubtedly has a disturbing effect on the bio- electric and biomagnetic information th at controls the proper functioning of the cells' delicate metabolism, which in aggregate leads to physical disorder and abnormality. Not only does this affe ct our physical well-being, but also our behaviour and mental abilities, thus inaugurating a decline in morals and the capacity to think creatively. According to Viktor Schauberger a brain, whose physical constitution and intellectual power has thus been"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"corrupted, would be incapable of co mprehending Nature's causal dynamic interdependencies. As a result of humanity's misguided activity, the Earth is becoming increasingly unstable; an instability that is also reflected in the growing instability of human institutions. These alarming events, however, will con- tinue to increase in scope and magnitude in a manner presently inconceiv- able, unless effective remedial measur es are instituted on a large scale as soon as possible. Since Nature's processes are interdepende nt, the total synergetic effect of the present disruptive activities can reach a magnitude out of all apparent propor- tion to the strength of the individual contributive stimuli. If the Earth is viewed as a sphere with a diameter of 1 metre (1,000 millimetres), for example, then the mesosphere, which largely defines our liv ing space, would extend to a height of about 10mm. As a living organism, the Earth breathes and pulsates. In common with other living creatures, and sympto matic of a sick or diseased condition, physical convulsions cannot be ruled out. Therefore, viewed at this scale, even a barely perceptible ripple 1 mm high swirling around the globe is not inconceiv- able. In real terms, however, this wo uld signify a tidal wave about 6.5km (4 miles) high. Such a tsunami would mean oblivion. It is necessary to write this down to emphasise the precarious position in which we find ourselves today, so as to provoke a greater interest in rectifying matters urgently. If we wish to reverse th is downward course, and to do so sus- tainably, then we must learn to feel Nature once more; to harken to her voice and to take heed of her subtle movement s. Some of this natural awareness, now long forgotten, we must learn from the very beginning. We need, as Viktor says \"to perceive the world not as an action, but as a reaction\" 1 , for only thus will we be able to arrive at the true causes of things and the reasons for the present parlous state of the world. While some causes ar e slowly being discovered, the underly- ing reasons, which are the most important and have the greatest influence on outcomes, have so far not been addressed. But how have we arrived at this precar ious situation? In the 16th century, before the development of science a nd technology, people were generally more attuned to the cycles, pulsations and subtler movements of Nature's energies. With few technical aids and ar tefacts, it was a more organic society and more intimately embedded in the natural world than modern humani- ty. People had a far more sensitive awareness for the events and movements of natural energies. With the gradual rise of science, this close connection with natural phenomena and their perceived causes was increasingly lost as the materialistically based methodology of science grew in scope and appli- cation. Science only interested itself in what it deemed to be the physical 1 From \"Return to Culture\" in the Schauberger archives. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"causes of a phenomenon, in what coul d be observed directly. It attributed causes to events which were actually the effects of causes unseen. As the sophistcation of science increased, so too was its widening estrangement from Nature and lack of real appreciation of her underlying patterns. In pursuit of this rational, materialistic approach, a language and technical ter- minology gradually evolved, which, while able to describe with great preci- sion the mechanical and physical effects being studied, was incapable of describing the true inner conformities of natural law. Science was thus able to describe the outer effects, but not the real inner causes of natural phe- nomena. One of the principal victims of this inability is the lack of under- standing of the essential nature of water - as the Giver of Life - and how it should be treated. Through all the disasters mentioned earlier, however, public attention is being drawn more and more towards the importance of water, its availability an d above all its quality. The purely economic paradigm, the offspr ing of a materialistic science, that governs us a l l humanity's present activities is untenable in the long term, for no economy of whatever kind is sustainable unless there is an abundance of clear, clean water and thriving vegetation. This is, and has always been, the bottom line of existence and evolutionary development. The thrust of the eco- nomic paradigm, while expanding and making communication more instan- taneous, which has made people aware of global events as they happen, has its downside in the rising fascination and belief in the power of technology. The increasing pursuit of 'hard-edged' technology and science led to our increasing obliviousness of natural energies and processes. Therefore our language never developed expressions for natural things intuited, sensed or otherwise experienced by those more naturally attuned. Despite our much vaunted, yet one-sided technical soph istication, we have in effect become more primitive than the so-called 'primitive' peoples who live in close con- tact and harmony with Nature in primeval forests. This inadequacy of lan- guage presented Viktor Schauberger with considerable problems in accurately describing all he perceived, for as he said \" ..... it is exceedingly diffi- cult to differentiate contempor ary concepts from those required here, for which there are no technical terms ..... Since no exact terminology exists, complicated paraphras- ing is required to describe the higher origins and causes of motion and formation. ....Therefore modern (and frequently inappropriate) terminology will have to be used. By placing them between quotation marks a different sense or meaning is intended. This I can do nothing about. Later on, other and fresh words will have to be coined to describe these new concepts.\" 2 Despite his attempts at the greatest possible clarity in his explanations, he was the first to admit, however, that \"Few will understand the meaning of what 2 From \"Organic Syntheses\", Impl osion Magazine, No.22. — Ed"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I have stated! Some individuals, however, will obtain an indefinable inkling. 3 ....Only those with exceptio nal intuitive abilities, and thus of an artistic turn of mind, will actually be able to gr apple with this extremely difficult way of thinking.\" 4 Some of these new words have been coined and where they occur in the text their meaning is explained. There is now an increasing urgency to rehabilitate this planet while there is still time. For this, a new and far pr ofounder knowledge of Nature is nec- essary, so that whatever is implemented by way of remedial measures, will be in harmonious accordance with Nature's laws. Fortunately, a large part of this fascinating new path has al ready been trodden and in the following pages we will be able to accompany Viktor Schauberger on his voyage of discovery into realms of energy and natural phenomena that hitherto have escaped our senses. The greater the numbe r of people who become aware of these new possibilities and actively pursue them, the greater will be the force to bring about their urgent pract ical implementation, now more than at any other time so desperately needed. And so in the pages that follow we will obtain entirely new insights into Nature's mysterious inner workings. These will open up a plethora of new possibilities for understanding how to reor ganise our activities, so that they harmonise with natural law. We will see how it was that Viktor Schauberger seems to have been guided unerringly to being at the right place and the right time to see otherwise unimaginabl e events unfold. In witnessing them, he gradually became able to perceive and understand the higher formative and controlling energies that organise and dynamise physical existence. In this way he was able to put together, piece by piece, an entirely new envi- ronmental paradigm, which will do much to help extricate ourselves from an otherwise irreversible decline. It was the gradual revelation of thes e new concepts as I was translating them that continually motivated me to translate as much material as I could lay my hands on. I felt that all was not irretrievably lost; that there was a way out of the global predicament. Here at last, there seemed to be answers to many problems that confronted huma n existence. The desire to discover more, constantly fired my enthusiasm . I developed a thirst for this new knowledge which I sincerely hope will also galvanise the reader as much as it did me.

Volume 2, 1993, is devoted entir ely to the recently discovered (early 1990's) transcript of a notebook compiled in 1941 by a Swiss, Arnold Hohl, which reports on his visits to Viktor Schauberger in 1936 and 1937.

They must obtain the necessities of lif e by scavenging from refuse heaps like animals, by begging, robbery, fraud or even murder. Having lost faith in current methods and customs, and viewing education as an exercise in futil- ity, our children are banding together, arming themselves and preparing to secure their rightful place in society by force. Under conditions where hospitals and refuges for the homeless are over- crowded, where the clientele of drug ad diction clinics and lunatic asylums is increasing and where cases of suicide are growing; it is understandable that no sane-minded person any longer gives credence to the empty promises of our leaders. It has long been apparent to thinking people that, if no radical departure in current economic doctrines and practices occurs, then only an enforced deci- mation of the overlarge population, a we ll-organised mass-mur der or, expressed more aesthetically, a modern war, mi ght perhaps cut this Gordian Knot. The most remarkable aspect of the matter is that neither the instigators of this apparently inevitable war (who seem c oncerned only for their own skins) nor our young people (who seem determined to fling away what they perceive as 5 \"Our Senseless Toil\" is the longest of Viktor Sc hauberger's published writings.

In other words, the ghastly , almost suicidal annihilation of the despairing masses with poison gas or ot her weapons is absolutely unnecessary. Both parties are unable to perceive that this scenario, which is impossible to equate with any cultural development, is only the entirely natural secondary effect of the intervention of a much higher power; a power with completely different means at its disposal. Means that are more fundamental, and more importantly, work much more drastically than all the weapons of war human brains have ever devised. If we were being honest, these were the very brains that we all had hoped would find a way out of this chaos. Let members of the older generation philosophise, drawing attention to their reductionist knowledge and its hollow cl iches. Let them ra nt and rave over these developments, for in the final anal ysis, the rising generation is absolutely right no longer to place any trust in the ability of its foreb ears, who have borne such bitter fruits. They are right to refuse to follow the false dictates of our intel- lectual leaders, who have brought such wretchedness upon us. Despite its sup- posedly high technological culture, the civilised world has reached such an ethical nadir that it has become incapabl e of perceiving that this physical and moral decline is none other than a progressive cultural dissolution. Humanity's most sacred possession, its freedom of subjective thought, action and feeling, will be literally trodden underfoot by people who were never really in a position to intervene in a positive way. In such a situation the colours under which these leaders c hoose to march is quite immaterial, because the same oppressive drive exists everywhere. Generally, the inner perception of the true causes has been lost, and consequently, the last chance of really effective help. More over, those in positions of power, who are incapable of forming their own opinion, must constantly rely on the advice of so-called experts who are them selves victims of a universally infe- rior education. As a result, they are unable to realise that it is precisely their advice, and the actions arising from it, which will inevitably transform this Earth into a hell, when it could be a paradise. If humanity does not soon come to its senses, and realise that it has been misled and misinformed by its intellectual leaders, the prevailing laws of Nature (with poetic justice) will reliabl y act to bring about a fitting end to this ineptly contrived culture. Unfort unately the most frightful catastrophes or scandalous disclosures will have to happen before people realise that it is their own mistakes that have led to their undoing. These can only be recti- fied with great difficulty precisely because they were principally committed by the authorities. Rather than pass judgement upon themselves, these insti- tutions and individuals, who are ever protective of their own interests, would allow millions of their fellow human beings to perish before they would ever admit to their mistakes."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"In discovering the causes, however, onl y one small step has been taken, because a host of so-called experts is a rrayed against any systematic attempt to put these errors right. These experts are ob liged to advocate the course they have championed, because it is their livelihood and they wish to be looked after until the end of their days. Yet, even this obs tacle might be overcome, if the mistakes could at least be restricted to a particular branch of industry. A thorough inves- tigation into the most common mistakes made over the centuries reveals the enormous spread of the malaise aris ing from fallacious precepts and perverse practices. It reveals such grave cultural, technological and economic transgres- sions that no branch of industry is left untouched. Not even a partially unaware expert, can absolve himself of his co mplicity, whatever his chosen field. At the outset a powerful opposition mu st be reckoned with. It will be quite futile to expect any support from experts when, under these circum- stances, it becomes evident that nearly every one of them would be threat- ened. But this obstacle should cause no al arm, for we are not concerned here with the livelihood of a few, but with the existence or non-existence of the whole of hoodwinked humanity. The behaviour of our young people today certainly provides clear evidence that humanity is still morally healthy. They militate vehemently against the signs of decay emerging everywhere and refuse to continue to trot mindlessl y down the road to war that has led us into an economic and cultural cul-de-sac. Opposition alone, however, achiev es nothing. Our youth will only achieve any practical success in their struggle when the causes are identified and the errors are revealed that we and previous generations made, so plunging the world into misfortune. For this reason it will become a sacred duty for all those who perceive the full extent of what has happened, to put aside all personal advantage and enlist for the final putting-to-rights of these many errors. The same is also the duty of everyone whose inner feel- ings admit the mere possibility of wrong-doing. The most effective way of righting these wrongs is to inform the general pub- lic of the great dangers of defective reas oning, and the futility of pursuing the present goals. Rich and poor, high and lo w alike, must beco me seized by doubt and well-founded mistrust. Affecting ever widening circles, this will ultimately kindle an inner sense of self-preservati on in the broad mass of people. Once awakened, this inner sense must not be allowed to rest until the people (and therefore God) have made their verdict known. They will then begin to work at a grass-roots level and bring about the n ecessary change for the better. It may indeed be a thankless task to inform the broad mass of people of the coming dangers which it neither sees nor wishes to see. However, regardless of the possible futility of revealing the fearful Menetekel 6 hovering above them, the 6 'Menetekel': Doomsday vision or portent of doom. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"attempt should still be made. At least our children and those dying helpless- ly in hospital should be made aware th at they are the victims of history and the present culture arising from it. Therefore the purpose of the following discourse is to arouse this inner sense of self-preservation in the public. If an instinctive premonition of the enormous dangers ahead, coupled with the mistrust latent in every human being, can be successfully awakened; then neither the proble ms affecting the Establishment's prestige nor its fears for its future will significantly impede humanity's final rescue from self-destr uction. It is not the purpose of these general explanations to el aborate on the many indicators brought to light in a review spanning a thousand years. These are referred to briefly only where they have a profound significanc e and their correct understanding is necessary for comprehension of the whol e. Naturally with such understand- ing, much will also have to be discar ded. Once humanity perceives the won- derful conformity in natural law, and the uniformity prevailing throughout Nature, it will gain ethically an d renounce any over-reliance on outward appearances. If we want to influence the course of our own existence positively, an exis- tence now constantly imperilled by the re-emergence of alien life-forms, and if we wish to safeguard it against further degeneration, we must allow Nature to take command. Or, if we do wish to intervene, we must first become conversant with the simplest pr inciples of Life. Every living thing is ultimately a bridge towards the build-up of the whole. Similarly the various religions and world-views merely repres ent spiritual bridges (often in prim- itive form) and so must make way for better ones, once the ethical upswing of humanity has overtaken them. Indisput ably the mightiest bridge of all for the evolution of life is represented by the entity WATER. Science views the blood-building an d character-influencing ur-organism 7 , 7 'Ur-organism': In Viktor Schauberger's writings in German, the prefix 'Ur' is often separated from the rest of the word by a hyphen, e.g. 'Ur-sache' in lieu of 'Ursache', when normally it would be joined. By this he in tends to place a partic ular emphasis on the prefix, thus endowing it with a more profound meaning than the merely superficial. This prefix belongs not only to the German language, but in former times also to the E nglish, a usage which has now lapsed. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, 'ur' denotes 'primitive', 'original', 'earliest', giving such examples as 'ur-Shakespeare' or 'ur-origin'. This begins to get to the root of Viktor's use of it and the deeper significance he placed upon it. If one expands upon the interpre- tation given in the Oxford English Dictionary, then the concepts of 'primordial', 'primeval', 'primal', 'fundamental', 'elementary', 'of first pr inciple', come to mind, which further encompass such meanings as: - pertaining to the first age of th e world, or of anything ancient; - pertaining to or existing from the earliest beginnings;- constituti ng the earliest beginning or starting point;- from which something else is derived, developed or depends;- applying to parts or structures in their ear- liest or rudimentary stage; - the first or earliest form ed in the course of growth. To this can be added the concept of an 'ur-condition' or 'ur-state' of ex tremely high potential or potency, a latent evolu- tionary ripeness, which given the correct impulse can unloose all of Nature's innate creative forces. In the English text, therefore, the prefix 'ur' will also be used wherever it occurs in the original German and the reader is aske d to bear the above in mind when reading what follows. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"water, as a chemical compound, and su pplies millions of people with a liq- uid prepared from this standpoints which is everything but healthy water. All efforts to make science acknowledge the serious errors it has made are useless from the start, because for it to make such an admission would sure- ly be to condemn itself. Of necessity, th erefore, it must adhere to its present doctrines. All those still possessed of h ealthy common-sense should categor- ically refuse to continue to drink wate r prepared in this way. By continuing to consume such water they will in evitably degenerate into cancer-prone, mentally and physically decrepit, physi cally and morally inferior individu- als. Let the experts and scientists, who are heavily attacked in what follows here, examine everything objectively and refute, if they will, the many criti- cisms presented. Those best placed to judge whether these assertions ar e well-intentioned or not, are the farmers, already struggling so hard for their native soil. Let all those who are forced to work in the great cities seriously contem- plate what would happen if, in addition to their bread becoming increasingly scarce, expensive and of worsening quality, their water also disappeared. This danger will be all the more dr eadful because the remaining reserves of water will become an unquenchable sour ce of that most frightful disease, cancer. Cancer is constantly on the incr ease and, if too far advanced, has no really effective cure. Therefore let all those not fortunate enough to enjoy a cooling drink directly from a healthy spring consider where their water comes from, how it is distributed, and what artificial additives are used to make it drinkable. Those unfortunates who are forced year-in and year-out to drink ster- ilised water should earnestly consider ho w an organism will be affected by water whose naturally-ordained ability to create life has been forcibly removed by chemical compounds. Sterilised and physically-destroyed water not only brings about physical de cay, but also gives rise to mental deterioration and hence to the systematic degeneration of humanity and other life-forms. The same is equally a pplicable to all forms of vegetation and all other preconditions for life in Nature. The reason people mistake their cultural and economic decline for a pa ssing crisis and strive in vain to master the increasingly widespread mise ry, lies mainly in the intellectual deterioration of humanity. Conforming to natural law this deterioration is followed or preceded by physical de generation. Only a penetrating study by intuitively gifted people can fathom the innermost nature of the life-giv- ing substance, water. Only through a painstaking investigation of the mate- rialised ur-substance, water, will it become possible to show a mentally and physically degenerating humanity the ways which will once more lead us upwards."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Progress through Transformation of the Atom - Not its Destruction! By means of only slight variations in temperature I have succeeded in decomposing various substances (ele ments and their compounds, minerals, metals, etc.) into their constituent parts, and subsequently to rearrange and recombine them. At present the scope for practical application of this dis- covery cannot be assessed, but it woul d undoubtedly imply a total reorien- tation in all areas of science and technology. Using this newly-discovered conformity with natural law I have alr eady constructed fairly large installa- tions in the fields of log-rafting and river regulation. They have functioned faultlessly for a decade and today still present insoluble enigmas to the vari- ous scientific disciplines concerned. Present management systems of forestry, agriculture, water and energy resources, as well as many theories and tenets of physics, chemistry, bota ny and geology will have to undergo a radical departure from basic principles. Even medical science will not be left unscathed by this discovery. In this way it is possible to generate any amount of energy in and from water itself and to regulate watercour ses over any given distance without embankment works. It is possible to transport timber and other materials down the central axis of flow, even if these materials (ore, stones, etc.) are heavier than water. It is possible to ra ise the height of the water table over a whole region and to endow the groundwater with the full spectrum of ele- ments required for the prevailing vegetation. Furthermore, timber and other materi als can be rendered incombustible and rot-resistant. Drinking water and spa-water of any desired composition and therapeutic effect can be artificiall y produced for man, beast and soil, in the same way that this occurs naturally . Water can be raised vertically in pipes without pumps. Electricity and ra diant energies of any magnitude can be generated almost wit hout cost. Soil quality can be improved and cancer, tuberculosis and nervous disorders healed. The Disrupted Cycle - The Cause of the Crisis Today a yearning for living naturally is on the increase. This craving for a strong, peaceful and healthy Nature is an inevitable symptom of the present age and the counterbalance to the inorganic civilisation we erroneously describe as culture. This ci vilisation is the creation of humanity, who high-handedly and without consideration for the true workings of Nature, has created a world devoid of meaning and foundation. Now Nature threatens to destroy humanity, for through his behaviour and his"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"activities he, who should be her mast er, has disturbed Nature's inherent unity. Today we are standing helpless and perp lexed before all that we have cre- ated; increasingly forced to recognise that our work, with all its problems, merely serves our own self-destructi on. With no glimmer of improvement anywhere in sight we feel hopelessly propelled towards a forlorn future. It is quite understandable therefore that an increasing number of people are sick and tired of this insane activity and now seeking ways to return to Mother Nature. The human is a being created according to Nature's laws and is therefore dependent upon them. In the course of time our magnum opus, our self-cre- ated pseudo-culture, 8 has become a meaningless and incoherent monstrosi- ty. Through the immense power of technology it has reached such gargantuan proportions that it almost equals the power of Nature herself. At the very least it is already able to interfere destructively with her great life-giving functions. Humanity represents but a small spark, a mere micro- organism in Nature's great panoply of Life. Encouraged by a short-lived, illusory success, humanity has embark ed on a course that is beginning to disrupt the great coherence of Life. Not only this, but it is also about to put an end to all high-quality growth a nd production on our macro-organism, Earth. Despite our accumulation of material wealth, humanity is now engulfed by a widespread economic collapse. Many areas of production exhibit regressive trends so that visible epicentres of decay are increasing on all sides and threatening humanity itself. Despite all the research no means can be found to prevent humanity from decaying alive. This is no more than the just and legitimate consequence of human activity. Knowing nothing of Nature's omnipotent laws, and with mindless greed, humanity claws into the life-giving organism of Mother Earth. She is now, with elemental power, beginning to paralyse the wanton hand that dared disturb the forces that serve all Creation. This unique law, which reigns supreme throughout Nature's vastness and one- ness, expresses itself in every creature and organism.

The causative force is our mind 9 and the soulless technology it has spawned, including our lawless and mind-destroying technological culture. These are jointly responsible for disr upting the circulation of the Earth's water and blood. Moreover, if everythi ng this mechanistic civilisation has created should perish in step with such development, then the breakdown is in no way a passing crisis. It is the inevitable collapse of a dizzily-high, foundationless cultural edifice, whereby whatever is left of genuine culture will also be swept away. Nature Protects Herself Nature's most effective protection is the frailty of humanity, its work and its activities. The consequences of its activities must sooner or later bring about its own demise because the greater part of its present endeavours contravenes every principle of Nature.

Within this constant metamorphosis lies hidden the pro- found secret of all evolution. Man alon e clings to rigid and seemingly incon- trovertible formulae and dogmas, and these are bringing about his undoing. Our origin and our future are shrouded in an almost impenetrable secret that we are unable to unveil. That we cannot do so is because we do not believe in the eternal transmutation and reincarnation of all living things. We do not perceive that all development must cease if we fail to respect the inner stillness and seclusion of Mother Earth and continue to exploit the sunken residues of former life (coal, oil, etc.) for purposes other than those wise Nature ordained. Nothing in Nature ever happens directly. One extreme always triggers off the other. Nature's Rhythmical Processes From Implosion Magazine, No.18 Nature is not served by rigid laws, but by rhythmical, reciprocal processes. Nature uses none of the preconditions of the chemist or the physicist for the purposes of evolution. Nature excludes all fire for purposes of growth on principle; therefore all contemporary ma chines are unnatural and construct- ed according to false premises. Nature avails herself of the biodynamic form of motion, which provides the biological pr erequisite for the emergence of life. Its purpose is to ur-procreate 'higher' conditions of matter out of the originally inferior raw materials. This gives the evolutionally older, or the numerically greater rising generation, the possibility of a constant capacity to evolve. Without any growing and increasing reserves of energy there would be no evolution or development. This results first and foremost in the collapse of the so-called Law of the Conservation of Energy and consequently the Law of Gravity and all other dogma lose any rational or practical basis. The solid, liquid, gaseous, etheric and energetic content of the organism - water, are not impurities as contemporary science would have us believe, but should be considered as aspiring (latent) energetic substances.

The so-called carrying capacity and tractive force 11 of water are not derived from any mechanical thrust. They are the biological consequence of self- evolving life-forms, which are built up through a hitherto unknown form of tension or potential. As an energetic nucleus it is the product of the organic syntheses that occur after the atoms of the basic elements have been dissoci- ated. The most interesting aspect in this regard is that the inner carrying and tractive forces in naturally flowing wa ter can be separated, enabling their use as a natural, formative force or as a natural, motive force. The biological outcome of the exploitable inner force of this organism - water, on the one hand is almost unlimited abundance of f ood, and on the other, if the formative component of this natural force is swit ched off, absolute freedom of motion can be achieved. In short, the result is free and unlimited mechanical power. Contemporary agricultural and econom ic practices are the cause of the decline in the quality of soil produce. From a more naturalesque 12 stand- point this concerns the suppression of all biological and indirect intermedi- ate processes. In order to prevent this it is necessary to ensure that agricultural equipment for biological farming is suited to Nature's purpos- es. If we wish to continue to exist, we shall have to become accustomed to substantially different ways of worki ng or adapt ourselves to natural forms of motion, whose patterns we can find in Nature. Then everything that we can see around us or are otherwise aware of will be provided in superfluity. What I have stated above is absolutely no product of wild fantasy, but is a fact that can be proven in every case. No scientist can deny this, because the devices have already been built that produce these organic products of syn- thesis. With the aid of these 'higher' creative forces produced by biochemi- cal motion, the fundamental Law of Mechanics (that resistance to motion increases with greater velocity) is rendered null and void. The resistance decreases with the naturalesque movement of the apparently lifeless con- tents of those organisms — air and water. 11 'Tractive force': This refers to the force described hydraulically as 'shear force' - the force that dredges and dislodges sediment. In German the term for shear force is 'Schubkraft', whereas Viktor Schauberger uses the word 'Schleppkraft'. The verb 'schleppen' means to drag, draw or pull. Viktor Schauberger's choice of 'Schleppkraft' here is quite specific, since in his view the movement of sedi- ment is due to the sucking action of fast flowing, dense cold water downstream, rather than to the mechanical impact of the water coming from upstream. In view of this subtle change in emphasis, in lieu if the hydraulically correct term 'shear forc e', the term 'tractive force' will be used. This dynamic is similar to the effect of wind on roofs, where a roof is blown off not by force from the windward side, but rather by the sucking effect of vortices created on the leeward side. - Ed. 12 'Naturalesque': As adjective or adverb, in the Oxford English Dictionary this is defined as \"Having the characteristics of Nature or natural obj ects.\" and \"Imitation or adherence to nature.\" Its use here and elsewhere is to differentiate between processes and objects that occur naturally and similar objects and processes that are technically c ontrived so as to accord with Nature's own func- tions. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Estranged from Nature, humanity does not understand water from which all life emerges.

Humanity!"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Your will is paramount! You can comma nd Nature if you but obey her. Do not complain if you must become her slave! Concerning Micro-Organisms Let us look at some situations in wh ich bacteria are produced. House floors were traditionally constructe d of softwood such as pine or fir. These were frequently washed and lasted for de cades, even when the gravel under- neath was permanently wet. As new st yles of interior decoration became fashionable, people wanted hardwood parquet flooring, which was laid directly over the softwood sub-floor. When these parquet floors were washed, micro-organisms sometimes de veloped and multiplied so that the superimposed flooring disintegrated in the space of a few years. In such cases our experts maintain that the timber employed was already infected. The true facts are substantially differe nt. The structure of fine hardwood is of a higher quality than the more coar sely-grained softwood. Fine-grained wood contains qualitatively higher-grade proteins which metabolise only wry slowly with a normal supply of oxygen. If there is sufficient space between the old lower floor and the parquet floor, so that no air-tight intermediate layer can develop between the materi- al l y different types of wooden flooring, then these floors can last for decades, provided the wood is of suita ble quality. If however the upper floor is washed and the intervening sp ace is sealed off as the wood swells, then between both floors a warm, humid layer is created. Owing to defec- tive water-proofing this now obtains its air and oxygen supply from the ris- ing groundwater in the walls. This is water that has not been exposed to the Sun. The concentrated oxygen rising with the uninsolated groundwater will expand in this moist, warm, intermedia te zone and become aggressive. In this condition, this highly-organised oxygen first of all combines with the less-complex proteins of the sub-floor. The energies resulting from these metabolic processes provide the impul se for the development of certain micro-organisms, which begin their v ital activity at appropriate ambient temperatures and eat away the parquet floor from the bottom upwards. Different types of food and micro-climate propagate different strains of these micro-organisms. They eventua lly infest the wider environment once their original breeding ground has been destroyed. It is therefore obvious that sickening trees in the forest will also be invaded by parasites. This especially affects shade-demanding sp ecies planted by modern foresters in the open; their sap becomes highly oxygenated and exhibits a much coarser structure. These phenomena ar e only the secondary and subsidiary"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"after-effects of clear felling operations practised over the last hundred years or so. The primary cause of the seri ous damage ensuing from clear-felling will be addressed later. 14 The question of how the microbe world comes i n t o being and all i t s vari- ous preconditions cannot be usefully a ddressed as long as water continues to be viewed as a lifeless substance and its inner metabolic processes are not taken into account. It is always the incessant metabolic activity of and with- in water that generates a particular life-form. Regardless of whether it is beneficial or harmful to humanity this life-form will ultimately serve the build-up of the whole. Another instructive example concerns the living conditions of the grotto- olm, a blind, cave-dwelling salamander of the genus proteus (fig. 1). If we study the water in subterranean lakes, where the influence of light is totally excluded, then in such water we find an extremely peculiar atmosphere and no microbial activity. Apart from olms, present in thes e lakes in great num- ber, there are no other living things. On what, then, do the olms live? The heavy concentration of oxygen in such water requires only a slight warming and a consequent increase in aggressiveness in order to transform highly complex carbones 15 into an even higher quality, which the olm then ingests with the atmosphe re contained in the wate r. The olm's respiratory processes and bodily heat trigger strong oxidising phenomena, leading to the development of increased heat. Together these are sufficient to trans- form highly complex carbones in the olm's body into the kind of food it requires to sustain life. On the other hand if the olm is removed from the cave and exposed to increased oxygen, the surface of its body begins to discolour and the olm dies. However if the olm is immediately placed in a container at the place where it was caught and if it is not exposed to the light of day, and if warm rainwater is poured into the container, then the identical phenomena occur. Again we encounter the same principle which for example also explains the mountain trout's peaceful stan ce amidst rushing water. The above examples, however, are insufficient to clarify the true nature of autogenesis (spontaneous generati on), which was acknowledged in the Middle Ages, but is rejected in mode rn times. Anothe r simple example 14 These phenomena, damage to timber and underfloor decay, are discussed in greater detail in The Fertile Earth — Vol. 3 of th e Ecotechnology series. - Ed. 15 'Carbones': In contrast to the normal use and de finition of 'carbon', Viktor Schauberger grouped all the known elemen ts and their compounds, with the exception of oxygen and hydrogen, under the general classification of 'Mother Substances', which he described with the word 'Kohle-stoffe', normally spelt 'Kohlenstoffe' and meaning carbon. Apart from the above definition the hyphen also signifies a higher aspect of carbon, both physically and energetically or immaterially. The additional 'e' in the English word is therefore intended to rede fine and enlarge the scope of the usual term 'car- bon' in accordance with Vi ktor's concepts. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"brings us even closer to the facts of the matter. Chose places where very dark and glistening water streams out ol the Ear t h ' s surface are the spawn- ing-grounds of fish for good reason. If we examine such water at the very limit of light penetration (at the place where it first encounters incident light) a noticeable change can be detected in the matter found in such water and, the first beginnings of bacterial li fe. The closer we approach the zone shielded from light, the more highly evolved the bacterial life in the water becomes. Conversely bacteria are incr easingly less complex the longer water flows in the light. If we observe the fish living there the same picture emerges. The closer the fish to the spring, the tastier they are. Ev ery fisherman knows that the powerful, stationary trout which live close to the spring, spurn every type of lure. Another remarkable fact is that these fish can live for months in caverns, to which they migrate when the water subsides during the hot summer months. The feeding habits of these creatures, which spend half their lives in daylight and half underground, are substantially different to those of fish living in the lower reaches of rivers and are similar to the lifestyle of the olm. A fact well known to alpine hunters is that the consumption of these almost-blind fish leads to higher sexual potency. Another very interesting phenomenon is demonstrated by the emergence of mealworms. If a vessel containing meal is placed in a dry, warm spot, then only a few worms come alive, or none at all. In order to obtain a greater quantity and better quality of worms, an old woollen cloth or a bone is placed in the meal and the lid closed. The increase in the worm population is caused by the introduced third category of carbone whose origin stems from a group of vegetable matter more complex than the meal. 16 While on the subject, a few interesting experiments can be described. If we pour a dilute solution of potassium chromate, or iron or copper sul- phate, onto a moist gelatinous film, beautiful patterns of deliquescence appear which under the magnifying glass exhibit a delicate, strongly branched structure. If river water is used to make the gelatine and the whole experimental arrangement is pl aced at the interface between a posi- tive and a negative temperature gradient , after a certain time various fungi, algae and mosses can be detected unde r the microscope. On the other hand if fresh seawater is used instead of fresh water, then different flora and fauna of this microbe kingdom will appear whic h are characterised by more worm-like, wriggling organism s.

The results of this experiment are particularly clear if the procedure is carried out in a well sealed glass vessel, insulated externally in order to maintain the correct temperature gradient (in this instance created artificially) and to prevent any transfer of energy to the outside. Apart from an atmosphere conducive to the formation of the desired micro-organisms or worms, th e presence of a third, more highly- organised substance is necessary in order to activate the energies and to cre- ate the conditions: for example, a drop of oil in water of the appropriate composition. Whether the propagation of these micr o-organisms is caused by their own physical energy or through the effect of an artificially-created temperature gradient, is quite immaterial. The most important factor in both cases is the necessary alternation of the climate over short periods of time. This frees the life-generating energy at the point of in tersection between the individual cli- matic zones (at the interface between two complementary temperature-gra- dients). Once again the prerequisite for the success of this experiment is the correct proportion of basic elements , the oxygen and carbone groups con- tained in the water. An appropriately-shaped vessel with a suitable air-tight seal is also required, in which the i nner climate can be produced and main- tained which is suited to the respectiv e creature and therefore necessary for i t s life activity. Another example can be mentioned to clarify a natural phenomenon which science has so far been unable to explain, but which can be clari- fied easily if we observe the circumstances that give rise to these remark- able events. These are the so-called 'worm rains' in Lapland which now and then happen in spring, during wh ich it rains living white worms about 3cm (1\") long. The usual, but incorrect assumption is that these worms, which fall from the heavens under the blood-red light of the midnight Sun, are somehow, somewhere caught up by wind, gathered together into a worm-cloud and at a particular location fall back to Earth in their thousands. A similar curious phenomenon is the so-c alled 'rotting season' that starts in Lapland towards the end of July and lasts about four weeks. Trees should not be felled during this period because after a few days fungus appears in such profusion that all the work is in vain. Even heavily salted bacon is tinged with all manner of colours. Th e smallest wound festers and can only heal after the rotting season has passed. The same applies to animals, since any wounds they suffer during this period are also incurable.

It is well-known that varying intensit ies and qualities of sunlight peculiar to each season play a major role in growth. For example, if light is directed into a room through window-pane s of a particular colour then the flies begin to die off. However, if the colour of the glass is changed they can revive. The decrease in tuberculosis since radio waves first vibrated through the ether is also no accident. These emissions cause an unbalanced and excessive concentration of oxygen both in water and the atmosphere which goes a long way towards explaining why human beings have become faster-living, more hot-tempered, but regrettably less intelligent in the process. Studies of earth rays and the appearance of symptoms of cancerous decay frequently associated with them, reveal that these can also be traced back to interactive processes in the interior of the Earth which have been impaired locally. These have been unfavour ably affected by shifts in the dis- tribution of groups of basic elements, for which groundwater acts as a con- veyor, distributing them to all life via the soil's capillaries. All these phenomena, so mystifying to science, can be duplicated or prevented once the nature of the primal substance of all life, the nature of water, is under- stood. Water in Ritual, in Life and in Medicine The following section is about the deeper implications of water in the life and ritual of our ancestors, and takes the form of an investigation of histori- cal symbolism, borrowed in part from the works of Martin Ninck, Norden, Weinhold and others. Having little or no time for inner composure, or the contemplation of human developmental hist ory, modern people naturally see water as a purely chemical substance, adequate for our physical needs as bathing water and possessing a purely practical value as the driving force for our power stations. Our ancestors viewed water from a completely different standpoint, seeing it as the source of al l life. Many legends and transmis- sions from the mythology of various earlier peoples conceal a much more profound meaning than is usually ascrib ed to them by their more rational but less deep-thinking descendants."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The point of view expressed in my explanations, that water is to be considered the blood of the Earth, finds its parallel at many points in our ancestor- worship 17 . Various sayings and depictions make reference to mother's blood, mother's milk and the maternal tears of our ancient Mother Earth. Even modern linguistics owe much to the symbolism of earlier epochs. It is therefore no accident that the word 'spring' has a feminine connotation. 18 The figures of the water-goddesses, the nymphs, are always coupled with stor ies of love. Nymphs are ready at all times to give birth, as Goethe also said of the spring in Faust: \"For a spring abrim with songs of love is constantly reborn.\" Wuttke-Meyer also cites the followi ng old German custom in connection with the fertility of springs. When going to a spring for the first time, every pregnant woman had to 'silver' it by throwing in a coin, otherwise it would dry up. Apart from the springs, rivers and lakes were also highly venerated in the rituals of the ancients. Even today we find that the distinguishing characteristics of the principal rivers are allegorically portrayed by their tutelary deities. According to whether the water is in motion or at rest, it w i l l be ascribed either a male or female fertility potency. In The History of Religion by Chant de la Sauss, we discover that the ancient Egyptians believed the ur-water Nun to be possessed of a dual potency. In his lyrical ode, 'God, Nature and Cosmos', Goethe writes: There, where water splits in twain, Life is e'er set free, unfolding its domain, And in emerging from its source, Water's blessed with vital, living force. There flock beasts, a-thirst for flowers, 'Midst thrusting boughs and leafy bowers. And in Faust, the same German prince of poetry declared: You sources of all life, upon whom hang Heaven and Earth, you spring forth, you overflow! 17 Schauberger wrote elsewhere (TAU, 137, p.16.): \"Similar things are reported by the priests of antiquity. In their rivers, such as the Nile , they constructed sluices in the form of temples. The religious populace believed it was the Gods who brought fertility to their fields in such a manner. In reality it was the knowledgeable and shrewd high-priests of the waters, who in this simple fashion maintained and looked after the primordial energy, the ur-life of the water, from which the legendary fertility and proverbial prosperity developed.\" -Ed. 18 In German, the word 'spring' Quelle, is preceded by the feminine article (die), and is therefore con- strued as being of feminine nature.

While in no way denying the necessity for redressing the long-standing imbalan ce between the sexes, this lack of differention in English may in some way have contributed to the apparently greater force of the feminist movement in the English-speaking world than in countries, where the natural male-female balance is to a large extent provided for and supported by the structure of the language itself. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"In order explain the important of water in medicine, it would be best to per- mit a doctor still c onnected with Nature to speak lor himself. Dr Schew writes: \"In the nature of things, water is the gr eat bestower of energy. It is the most invigorating, and at the same time, the most powerful of all tonics. In this regard, there is nothing else like it in the whole world.\" In his book on natural methods of heali ng, F. E. Bilz le ts the great poet himself express this point: \"This vast expanse of water - the ocean - is the condensed breath of God, without which all would be but a cold and barren mass of rock. It is a breath that has endowed the Earth with fertility, beauty and life.\" The role played by water in the cons titution of the human body resides in the fact that the body consists of up to 90% water. It is much easier for human beings and animals to go without food for a long period than to go without water. The average person can survive for about three weeks with- out food and water. However, if water containing a certain quantity of nutri- ents in material and ener getic form is drunk, then such a person can last for considerably longer. A Dr McNaughton tells of a madman who was able to survive for 53 days on water alone. Today, modern civilised people drink predominantly bad water. As a result they have to a large extent given up drinking any water at all, thereby inflicting serious damage on the body. Dr Munde writes: \"Recent investigations by Genth, Bequerel and others reveal that an increased discharge of moults follows from an increased intake of water in the body, whereas a reduced intake of water results in a great er condensation of the same, and a greater quantity of uric acid in the urine - a fact of which those stricken with gout should take heed. As can be determined by comparing various medical experiments, there is a certain optimum quantity of water for ev ery individual, which very significantly raises the quota of solid matter in the urine.\" Finally, attention should be drawn to the fact that people who consistently drink good, healthy water also ha ve a good appetite a nd consequently probably stay healthier.

There is absolutely no time to be lost. It is understandable that our hydraulic experts take no delight in the ruth- less revelation of this deplorable state of affairs. However, t h i s does not alter the facts of the matter. Numerous attemp ts in recent times to withhold my many informative dissertations from the public by removing relevant arti- cles from books, newspapers and periodic als are childish. By so doing, they will ensure that I make even greater e fforts to place these expositions before the public. Such attempts only demonstrate a certain weakness, and in any case are merely proof of the irrefutability of what I have stated. Frequent protestations that 'contemporary met hods are being practised world-wide and hence cannot be wrong' mean absolutely nothing. At best, they serve o n l y to explain why the whole world is in such an appalling state. In this situation the best strategy can only be a ruthless attack, in which all parties are at all times entitled to the right of defence and rebuttal. All those who wish to perpetuate the status quo for fe ar of losing their jobs should bear in mind that an existence built on false fo undations cannot in the long run be maintained. That is, even when it appears guaranteed by security of tenure, because an impoverished people pays no taxes and therefore cannot afford and expensive bureaucracy. When they become ill, let those who con tinue to believe that water is a life- less substance to be controlled by mathematical formulae alone, then sum- mon a mathematical genius to their si ckbed instead of a doctor. Their fellow men will then be rid of such narrow-minded thinkers as fast as possible. Unfortunately the catchword 'systematisation', which all too frequently governs our methods of working nowadays, has found greater favour than is good. Today, the expression 'logical thinking' or 'mathematically-trained thought' conceals sheer intellectual inca pacity or mental in ertia. By far the largest number of discoveries and i nventions have not been made on the paths trodden by scientists, often to their astonishment, if not to their great dismay. The overall progress of the worl d is caused by a certain measure of discontent, the characteristic phases of which are revolutions or wars. Similarly great advances in the real m of the intellect are brought about by revolutionary thinkers. A certain myopia has gained ground even in the empirical methods practised in contemporary hydraulic research institutes. People still cling desperately to the external appearance of a given phenomenon, thereby failing to study the far more important nature of its inner processes. Indeed, amongst those in this field who are responsible there are some who have already recognised the limited value of such purely superficial observations.

Concerned only for their own well-being, they are quite prepared to create a black market not only in foods, but even in the water destined for rich and poor alike. Such persons should be warned that the despair of the great mass of the people will bring about a much earlier end to their selfish endeavours than they could ever foresee. Everyone else, especially our young people, should cooperate as a first priority in the rebuilding of our former indigenous forest, and with this the restoration of healthy water to the Earth. Then we shall all be able to survive and humanity will continue to exist. This year (1933) is to be remember ed as the hundredth anniversary of Alfred Nobel (1833-1896), the Swedish chemist and engineer, who became a millionaire through the invention of dynamite in 1866. Becoming aware of the tragic consequences of his invention a few years before his death, he established the Nobel Foundation, no doubt in the desire to make amends for the frightful harm he had caused. Millions of human lives have since fallen victim to this fearful device of destruction and war. Further millions, perhaps even whole races, will yet be r obbed of their lives, of their very existence, if humanity continues to avail itself of such inventions. It is not unique for humanity to have to traverse tortuous and often dangerous routes before arriving at a better understanding of a matter. If we study Gilbhart's article, which appeared in the business section of the Deutsche Zeitung (no.242, 1933), we see that the German government is now in the process of rectifying a serious mistake committed about a hun- dred years ago. It caused perhaps even greater harm than the use of explo- sives in modern warfare. This article was entitled 'New Forestry'. Scientists have long been aware that many practic es in modern forestry are unsound and that our forests have declined in quality since the introduction of scien- tific forestry methods in about the middle of the last century. Yet they have so far failed to show the necessary courage to own up manfully to their mis- takes. With the prohibition against cl ear-felling much has been achieved, but not all that is necessary. This was done merely to gain time in order to safeguard their employment, or at leas t to make provision for their old age at the expense of the general public. It will not succeed however, because a terrible evil has been foisted on the en tire human race by forestry's sup- posed science, will be studied in such detail that every schoolchild will understand the result of its ignorance of the true facts. The same applies equally to modern agriculture a nd other contemporary achievements.

For this reason, equal care will also have to be taken to ensure that everyone learns how to use these forces. For if humanity is truly intent on self-destruction through the use of force, then it should have the requisite means placed at its disposal, so that it can fulfil this desire as q u i c k l y as possible. T h i s should leave the reader with mixed feelings. It should be quite apparent that, in view of many un doubtedly correct observations and well- founded clues, it should not be necessary to attack science and technology as fiercely as they have been attack ed here. However, because it would be utterly futile to seek any other worthwhile contact in this direction, unfortu- nately, attack is absolutely necessary. The following explanations, which will be elaborated further in later pub- lications, should furnish sufficient proof of the impossibility of a compro- mise or of the incorporation into the ex isting scientific edifice of discoveries only touched upon here. The errors of contemporary science and the dam- age wrought by today's technology are too great. With the present (1933) consumption of coal and oil at a leve l of two thousand million tonnes per annum, the moment when this importa nt source of energy will be exhaust- ed is coming disturbingly closer. Within a few centuries, as science has cal- culated, the last reserves of oil will ha ve been extracted from the Earth. If we continue to busy ourselves in the same old way, we will have to search for other sources of energy since the loss of these energies would signal the end of our civilisation. Science earnestly endeavours to disc over new forms of energy and also believes these can be obtained through research into cosmic energies. However this pursuit demonstrates not only an almo st boundless bias in thinking, but also furnishes irrefutable proof of the untenabili ty of scientific endeavours and objectives. To put it mildly, they can only be described as Utopian. A science possessed of such goal s cannot possibly be taken serious- ly, and cannot claim the right to a leading role in the fate of humanity. The direction indicated earlier is fa r from being the only correct one. Nevertheless it is closer to the truth an d is thus able to throw a revealing light on these misconceptions, since the ascertainment of the purest truth is an unattainable goal for humanity and will probably ever remain so. The very idea of using alternative (cosmic) energies once all th e reserves of coal, oil and timber have been exhausted is so absurd that this alone condemns the whole of science. Temperatures prevailing in the interior of the Earth are the product of interactions that take place betwee n carbones contained in the Earth and oxygen entrained by infiltrating water. Were the last reserves of highly- organised carbones eventually to be to tally stripped from the Earth, these"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"interactive processes could no longer take place and the Earth would cool off. Since it is practically impossible to remove all carbones from the Earth however, these cooling phenomena can on ly occur to an extent commensu- rate with the severity of disturbance to these inner interactions. These dis- turbances are caused by the removal of carbones, or by ventilating the Earth. Conforming to natural law, th e effects of today's technological and industrial intrusions into the Earth must therefore lead to the following results: If various external influences such as bore-holes, deep wells, shafts and open-cut mines, excessive extraction of coal, metals and minerals, all act to inhibit these interactions, they will pr ovoke a cooling of the Earth's crust. The atmosphere will also cool off as a further consequence. These causes, which ensure an excessive accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere, must also result in its concentration due to the influence of cold. In the course of time air strata normally subjected to low atmospheric pressure will become heavier in the absence of upward-stream ing groups of carbones. These stra- ta will sink downwards, over-saturati ng both the vaporous and the fluid hydrosphere with oxygen. If, having now become over-saturated with oxy- gen and heavy, this water succeeds in in filtrating into deeper strata of the geosphere, into the car bonesphere for example, then under the prevailing high temperatures the accompanying oxygen will trigger off lively oxidative events. The cumulative effect of these will resu lt initially in localised explosions, eruptions or earthquakes, and subsequent ly in ruptures of the Earth's sur- face. This will provoke the sudden rel ease and elevation of gaseous carbone groups. These relatively elementary s ubstances will first interact with atmospheric oxygen only at great altit udes, and in various hot zones will trigger off a regional redistribution, causing sudden cold spells and the movement of stronger or weaker air currents. In equatorial zones the ascent of these carbones will be enhanced by the stronger reflection of heat. Under certain circumstances the reciprocal effects thus provoked can become so large and so aggressive that the zone of inter- action in the lower levels of the atmosphere extends downwards in the form of funnel-shaped clouds. This leads to the general formation of tornadoes and the violent cyclonic storms which have long been known in equatorial regions. Through these powerful interac tions, water-vapour will be forced into localised concentrations, result ing in the formation of heavy thunder- storms and the occurrence of cloudbur sts. Apart from large quantities of carbones, substantial amounts of water-v apour are also e xpelled into the atmosphere during strong eruptions, offering increased resistance to the Sun's radiant energy, and hence to an increase in heat (through the heat- absorbing function of atmospheric water-vapour)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The sequel to this phenomenon is a short-lived, luxuriant profusion of vegetation (a phoney agricultura l success) in which co nsumption of gaseous carbones (carbon dioxide) is intensified. These substances, however, can no longer he produced from the Earth's interior in the necessary and regular proportions. This leads to a qualitative decline in various forms of vegeta- tion, and to a decomposition of the dynagens 20 reflected back by the Sun, namely to a systematic cooling-off, and therefore to the inauguration of a new ice age. 21 These developments will soon be brought about by the devas- tat i n g activities of those involved in fo restry, agriculture, water and energy- resources management because, as a result of their predominantly one-sided way of looking at things, the regularity of the water cycle will be inhibited, and with it the energy cycl e and the upward flow of carbones. As alre a d y mentioned, it is inevitable th at humanity's present absurd practices will bring about a drop in the quality of dynagens reflected back by the Sun. Ultimately, by arresting the oxidative processes in the atmosphere, the gen- eration of heat will also be reduced. It can thus reasonably be asserted th at the next ice age will be virtually dragged in by contemporary science and technology. For this reason the manifestations of economic decline, familiar the whole world over, must logically keep pace with the advance of technology. This state of affairs will worsen at the same tempo as the sour ces of energy required to maintain technological progress are removed from the Earth. The gr eater the progress we achieve in technology, the deeper we will and must sink culturally and economically. However, this is not the end of the matter!! With the curtail- ment of the absolutely essential oxidative processes in the Earth, enormous amounts of water must make their appe arance, initially in the atmosphere and subsequently in the Earth, because in neither case can it be assimilated or reconstituted. Now heavily over-satur ated with oxygen and poor in car- hones, this water, which either infiltra tes into the Earth or quickly re-evapo- rates and streams upwards into the atmo sphere, will reach its freezing point due to the absence of its partner, the carbones. This results in an unavoid- able and fundamental change in general climatic conditions. Furthermore, when the potential of the groundwater, now possessing a uni-polar charge, has been reduced thoug h lack of carbones, it is forced to 20 'Dynagen': Belongs to the higher formations of energy described elsewhere as Ethericities: The term 'ethericity' refers to a supra-normal, near non- dimensional, energetic, bio-electric, bio-magnet- ic, catalytic, high-frequency, vibratory, super-poten t entity of quasi-materia l, quasi-etheric nature belonging to the 4th and 5th dimensi ons of being. As such it can be further categorised as a fructi- gen, qualigen and dynagen, which respectively represent those subtle energies, whose function is the enhancement of fecundity or fructification (fructigen), the ge neration of quality (qualigen) and the amplification of immaterial energy (dynagen).

There it shifts its boiling point, oxidises prematurely and giv es rise to violent erup- tions. With the final subsidence of the water, all vegetation will gradually disappear in the same way that it once appeared. After the occurrence of immense catastrophes, which will manifest themselves in the form of earth- quakes, cloudbursts, whirlwinds and so on, the vegetation zone, in confor- mity with natural law, will slowly but su rely be covered with ice. Deluges and catastrophic inundations are already on th e increase everywhere today, to which approximately 20 million human lives will fall victim. Presently these are only harmless events compared to the disasters which can be expected in the future. These must inevitably occur if humanity continues to allow itself to be guided and controlled by contemporary science. As a case in point, the present explana tion for the formation of rain is so incomplete that it is hard to believe how such a hypothesis could have been upheld for so many centuries. Science expl ains the origin of rain as the con- densation of atmos pheric water-vapour due to the presence of cold. This explanation is approximately true in its widest sense, but in the final analy- sis it actually describes only a very unimportant secondary effect. Even the formation of rain, as elementary experi ments prove, must be attributed pri- marily to the above interactions. These can only arise when ascending car- bones intersect with descending oxygen groups attached to microscopic particles of ice. 22 Were the scientific view correct, then in the higher strata of the atmos- phere it ought to rain in winter and snow in summer, since it is well known that air and ground temperatures swap places with each other with the alternation of the seasons. In consideration of the events describe d only in broad outline here, there is only one practical option left. That is to make humanity either suspicious or rebellious. Only thus, at the eleventh hour , will it still be possible, perhaps, to trigger off the necessary impulse towards recognition of the unimaginable danger that exists. This is a dang er which today threatens a hoodwinked humanity regardless of race or nation. There are people, endowed with an almost God-given cluelessn ess, who have brought us to this terrible impasse and would lead us on into chaos also. Th ose apart, there ought to be people with enough humanitarian sensitivity to prevent our children from being led unawares into such frightful cataclysms. The possibility still remains to rip the blindfold from the eyes of sensible individuals and with their help, to undertake a rescue attempt. Our young people would doubtless energetical- ly support this because it is their future that is at stake. There is no herbal remedy for stupidity, and therefore the unconsciously insane can hardly be 22 See \"The Learned Scientist and the Star in the Hailstone\" in The Water Wizard, vol. 1 of the Ecotechnology series.- Ed."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"called to account. However, if the causes of decline appearing everywhere are recognised for what they really are, then any continuation of these per- verse practices, which are consciously leading all humanity towards disaster, would unquestionably be deemed a criminal act. Conforming to natural law, the systematic disturbance of the water bal- ance will reliably happen as a consequence of current industrial, tech- nological and economic practices, leading to the increasingly extensive suppression of interactions that condition all life in Nature. The logical out- come of the cessation of oxidative processes occurring between basic forma- tive substances is an increasingly widespread cooling and desolation of the all-nourishing vegetation zone. If the present modi operandi continue to be applied, then apart from the emergence of disease and degeneration, world- wide famine must inevitably follow. The insights gained from the precedin g explanations must force us to a decision. We renounce the grievously damaging achievements of contempo- rary science and technology and we strip our reigning intellectual masters of their power. Alternatively we allow th em, little by little, to strip us of ours, and by every trick in the book to put us on ice (in the true meaning of the term). In this scientifically contrived, conserved form, we will be preserved for as long as conceivably possible. At the very least we will eventually pro- vide a future humanity with the cautionary end-product of a bygone 'culture'. Vienna, November 1933. Let The Upheaval Begin! From Implosion Magazine, No.67. Even in earliest youth my fondest desire was to understand Nature and through such understanding to come closer to truth; a truth I was unable to discover either at school or in church. In this quest I was thus drawn time and time again into the forest. I could sit for hours on end and watch the water flowing by without ever becoming tired or bored. At the time I was still unaware that in water lay hidden the greatest secret. Nor did I know that water was the carrier of life or the ur-source of what we call conscious- ness. Without any preconceptions, I simply let my gaze fall on the water as it flowed past. Only years later did I come to realise that running water attracts our consciousness like a magnet and draws a small part of it along in its wake. It is a force that can act so powerfully that one temporarily loses consciousness and involuntarily falls asleep. Gradually I began to play a game with water's secret powers; surrender- ing my free consciousness and allowing the water to take possession of it for a while. Little by little this game turn ed into a profoundly earnest venture, "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"because I realised that one could de tach one's own consciousness from the body and attach it to th at of the water. When my own consciousness eventu- ally returned, the water's most deeply concealed psyche often revealed the most extraordinary things to me. As a result of this investigation a researcher was born who could dispat ch his consciousness on a voyage of discovery. I was thus able to experience things that had escaped other peo- ple's notice, because they were unawar e that a human being is able to send forth his free consciousness into those pl aces the eyes cannot see. By practis- ing this blindfold vision, I eventua lly developed a bond with mysterious Nature, whose essential being I slowly learnt to perceive and understand. In the process it gradually became mo re and more apparent that we human beings are accustomed to se e everything upside down and back-to- front. The greatest surprise was the wa y we allow our most valuable asset, this great spiritual gift, to flow away unused and retain only the rubbish. This wasteful tendency we owe principa lly to books that were originally the product of an intuition, but which subs equently became merely the reposi- tories of residual understanding. Books seldom had any connection with their original spirituality. As a result I became an enemy of the so-called eru- dite, the scientists and scholars, who set down their intellectual dross in black and white. The unsuspecting masse s had to accept this garbage as gospel truth and became perverted by it. As a huntsman I gradually developed a great respect for the instinct of supposedly inferior creatures. In thei r close connection with Nature, they manifest the unadulterate d thoughts that Nature has impressed into their animal brains. It became clear to me that consciousness, which has been given to humanity as the final link in Nature's evolving chain, represents a great danger to a capriciously-minded hum anity and its habitat. Free con- sciousness is least free as long as an yone attuned to Na ture fails to under- stand how to make intelligent use of this divine gift. Everything in Nature is built up sequentially, step by step. Therefore as a rule the intellect is some thing of an outlaw. It runs the gauntlet of a thou- sand dangers and is subjected to peri ls more hazardous than unsuspecting humans can imagine. It is therefore inevitable that so much deceit abounds in our societies and that humanity is sinking deeper and deeper into a mire of depravity. This is due to the fact th at humanity followed the false dictates propounded by our great philosophers, who then speculatively translated their pseudo-knowledge into a logic ge nerally referred to as mathematics. Kant made the fallacious assertion th at any knowledge to which mathemat- ics cannot be applied cannot be describe d as science. Instead of becoming a creator on Earth, humanity became a vulgar speculator, more and more estranged from truth and reality. Consequently, we lost all connection with Nature and became outlaws in the truest sense of the word."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Humanity has become accustomed to re late everything to itself (anthro- pocentrism). In the process we have failed to see that real truth is a slippery thing upon which the perpetually re formulating mind passes judgement almost imperceptibly. In the main all that is then left behind is whatever was drilled into our brain with much trouble and effort, and to which we cling. To give rein to free thought, to allow our minds to flow freely and unimped- ed, is too fraught with complications . For this reason the activity arising from these notions inevitably becomes a tr affic in excreta that stinks to high heaven, because its foundations were already decayed and rotten from the very beginning. It is no wonder, therefore, that everywhere everything is going wrong. Truth only resides in all-knowing Nature. In the course of all this, the mass of humanity unwittingly became the advo- cate of a pseudo-knowledge that stationed itself either between humanity and Earth or between humanity and heaven, effectively removing whatever quali- ty and value there was at the outset. Some people bound their hands to a futile labour that merely resulted in destru ction, while others imprisoned their minds with the absurd shackles of dogma, itself an invention of a humanity that has gone astray. In Nature there is no such dogma, because here only con- stant flow, constant movement and he nce constant reciprocity prevails. Whether those leaders, who led the broad mass of humanity astray, invol- untarily deceived themselves and therefore others, can never be properly established. In any case, the time is no t far off when people will become free and learn to understand the ur-purpose of life through their own percep- tions. The means is already at ha nd to free humanity from the accursed greed and material enslavement to which the vast majority fell victim and in which we became ensnared because we unconditionally believed every- thing. The wherewithal is a machine that has nothing whatsoever in com- mon with the nature of contemporary machines. This machine is organised Nature. It is able to transform various substances in a form-building sense, and to ennoble all materi als of whatever kind. The products of this ennoblement are pu re ethereal substances possessed of a higher quality, which animate and increase all things. The ensuing superabundance of everything will rele ase humanity from bondage. In this way humanity, now a robber and a glutton, will slowly divest itself of mate- rial needs and become again what it once was, the crown of Creation. It is the final link in this organically interwoven structure, the organiser and rep- resentative of Creation on Earth. Acco rding to an old saying, originally everything was already here, but it all had to happen twice, precisely because humanity, born as a duality, is both good and bad, wise and unspeakably stupid.

Such a state of"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"unemployment has nothing to do with th e present world affliction. Instead of work (in its present sense) a se nse of service will evolve for which humanity was destined since the beginning of time; service to Nature. Such a service encompasses the organisation and dispensing of substances that have materialised into the world, wh ich humanity must then fairly and evenly distribute. These concentrations of energy increasing to the point of superfluity, will be equally active ever ywhere. They will thereby create an equality which, in our dim recollecti ons, we recognise as true kinship and mutual compatibility. Pseudo-communism will pa ss away and in its place the true communism will arise, of which Christ taught two thousand years ago. It could not come about earlier because at the time all knowledge of the laws of Nature was kept secret by the elite of society, and because the broad mass of the people were too immature fully to comprehend the true teachings. For this reason humanity had to travel the bitter ro ad of suffering and devise a technology which, as everything else that humanity does for the first time, is one-sided, incomplete and hence of no real value. On the brink of suicide, which in all certainty today's technology will mete out to us if we continue to make use of it, humanity has rediscovered the means to save itself from oblivion. This machine will reduce the air-pressure that presently presses down on the Earth. In consequence abundan ce will be produced automatically, because a rebirth will occur of those things which first had to die because they were products of humanity's first efforts and therefore were one-sided. Through the rebirth of spirit, humanity will become accustomed to revere and care for all life arising anew out of the Earth. We will emulate the bees, who are known to dispense and to give whenever they take. Since we already know how to take a nd steal, we will have to learn how to give. In all our doings we will shun inorganic compounds (such as artifi- cial fertiliser) and abandon the stupid ity of obtaining energy and power by combusting the building-blocks of Nature. The organ-machine* will fulfil every wish that a person who desires to foster growth can conceive. It will, however, destroy everything that is untrue, speculative and deceitful. It was my duty to find this machine. The might y task that now awaits is to find those people who understand how to organise everything in readiness for the coming upheaval of this era. But before these people have been found no human eye will ever see this machin e in full operation, because I am fully aware of the awesome responsibility involved. It forces me to keep silent until I am convinced that this machine will serve only one purpose: Nature. *Paved with extraordinary insights into Nature's deeper workings, Viktor Schauberger's long and arduous road through Nature's living laboratory toward s the discovery of this machine will slowly be revealed in the pages that follow. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Nature as Teacher Nature as Teacher From the combined texts from Implosio n Magazine, No.7, No.19, No. 111 and TAU Magazine, No.146 (June 1936). Nature moves everything and creates this movement through various differences in temper-ature and potential. Where these intersect the primordial life-force is born. Ther e are only a very few people who really know how to observe Nature a nd to notice these small and almost imperceptible differences in motion, temperature, tension and potential. With them it is possible to overcom e physical weight, to switch off the uni- versally recognised Law of Gravity and to demonstrate that the same appar- ently irrefutable Law of Conservation of Energy is a fallacy. If these two laws, so fundamental to contemporary science and technology, are invali- dated, then the crowning law of the la tter, in which resistance to motion increases by the square of the increase in the speed of motion, can no longer be upheld. It goes without saying that the collapse of these conformities with law automatically negates the law of heat-equivalence and the law of gravity. Nobody with a scientific ed ucation believes that these are real possibili- ties and will consider it all to be Utopian nonsense. It is precisely these dif- ferences, however, that enable them to overcome their body-weight and makes possible their spiritual and intellectual development, growth, and ability to reproduce. For this reason it is necessary to give a few examples of these decisive differences in motion, temperature and potential. At their point of intersection il primo movere, the animating impulse, is awakened in any material which is m oved naturalesquely.

The Odsee Rumbles From Implosion Magazine, No.7, p.21 \"Nature as Teacher\" Below the Ring in the Hetzau lie the Odseen (Od lakes). After a long period of hot weather they begin to rumble. This is the local expression for the thunder-like noise that wells up from the bottom of the Od lakes, when water-spouts as high as a house rise out of the middle of them. I will describe the event as I witnessed it. One hot summer's day I sat at the edge of the lake, debating whether I would go for a cooling swim. I had decided to do so when I noticed that the lake water had begun to swirl about in strange whorls. Trees, which had been carried down into the lake by av alanches, branches and all, freed themselves from being stuck in the sand and began to perform a spiral dance, which swept them faster and faster towards the centre of the lake. There they suddenly stood up on end and were dragged down into the depths by such a powerful suctional force that their bark was stripped off. This is similar to instances where people have been carried aloft by torna- does fully clothed, only to be cast down to Earth again stark naked. Not a single tree ever reappeared from the depths of the lake. Shortly thereafter the lake was calm again as if its hunger had been satis- fied by the victims it had sucked into its maw. This, however, was merely the calm before the actual storm. Suddenly the lake-bottom began to bellow. All at once a water-spout as tall as a house shot up into the air from the middle of the lake. This turning, twisting, funnel-shaped, up-surge of water was accompanied by a thunderous roar. Then it collapsed. Waves struck the "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"shore, which I had to leave as quickly as possible because the water-level in the lake suddenly began to rise uncannily. What I had just witnessed was the 'primordial' growth of water, th e renewal of water in lakes without affluent streams. For the first time 1 began to understand what was happen- ing, though not all was completely clea r to me, and another experience was necessary to clarify this intriguing question. The Fish-Eagle From Implosion Magazine, No.7, p.21 \"Nature as Teacher\" As a young apprentice fore ster I spent every free mo ment I could in a sleek rowing boat on a mountain lake near th e forester's house. I caught fish and hunted ducks and other aquatic game. 23 My dearest wish was to shoot a mighty fish-eagle. This magnificent bird appeared every evening above the so-called salmon holes, circled in peculiar curves and then fell like a stone, only to soar upwards again with a large salmon in its talons. What always puzzled me was how the fish-eagle managed to catch fish in the salmon-holes without actually diving into the water, because the salmon never came to the surface. It was a puzzl e that took me a lo ng time to solve. The only solution, I thought to myself, was to observe the predator and its victims very carefully. A steep outcrop of rock on top of which there was a tall spruce tree provided an ideal vant age point. Equipped with a good spy- glass and well concealed by upper foliage, I sat in the top of this tree alter- nately watching the eagle and the sa lmon swimming in the hole, which lay at an angle below me. I was careful not to make the slightest movement. Punctual almost to the minute, the mighty fish-eagle made its appearance and flew over the salmon holes just above the water, emitting a shrill cry and flapping its wings particularly vigor ously. It was as though it wanted to tell its victims that it was now there a nd that they should prepare a suitable offering. The eagle then rose almost vertically in smaller and smaller spiralling circles, altering its course w ith an occasional flap of the wings. Then like a block of stone, with wings furled and talons tight against its body, it plummeted down onto one of the salmon-holes. Just above the water-surface it braked its fall with a flap of the wings and a large salmon was already wriggling in it claws. Heav ily laden, it flew towards the forest in a wide curve and disappeared. Quite logically, my immediate attention was drawn to the behaviour of the fi sh-eagle. I totally forgot about the 23 Schauberger wrote this and later hunting referen ces in a time when hunting was not ecologically disapproved of in the way it is now. In his day it was still conceivable simultaneously to love Nature and to hunt. Species were not then so rare or threatened as now, and old rural traditions, now dead, still survived. Valu es have changed! - Ed."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"behaviour of the apparently well-pr otected and largely motionless salmon in the deep holes. The next time I determined to obser ve everything very closely indeed. The eagle arrived, made its presence known as before and soared aloft in the now familiar, increasingly tight spiral curves. The spectacle was so fasci- nating that I nearly fell over backwards, because my body was unconscious- ly following the movements of the fish below. I only just managed to catch myself in time. All the salmon were copy ing the upward-spiralling, swirling movements of the fish-eagle above them. As though joined together with a string, they followed each other towa rds the surface, describing narrower and narrower spiral turns in their circular ascent. The fish swimming in the middle were pressed so closely together that their fins stuck out of the water. There it was again? The dark shadow of the eagle and the miniature mael- strom. The eagle had one of the largest salmon in its clutches and sailed off. As often as I was able, I watched this performance, which always followed the same sequence. Every time I was surprised at my own reactions while sitting on my perch high up in the air. As if hypnotised, I faithfully copied the movements of the fish like a transf ixed child watching a swing or the grimaces of a clown. I then decided to sh oot the fish-eagle. The next time it swooped down on the salmon-holes I fired at it with my shotgun. The eagle floated, wings outstretched, on the surface of the water and I quickly reached it in my boat. When I looked at it sitting there so helplessly, I decid- ed then and there to catch the majestic bird alive and keep it in a large chick- en coop. It was not as easy as it looked, however. I drew closer and touched it with the tip of an oar from which splinters were already flying. Finally I got out my short leather jacket, buttoned it up carefully and dropped it over the eagle's head. Dripping with sweat and bleeding from many scratches, I returned home, where it took a combined effort to encage this exhausted eagle. After a few days it began to take food again. Fish and water-snakes were in ample supply and the wounded wi ng healed quickly. Eventually we became good friends and later on I let it go. The Swing From Implosion Magazine, No.l ll, p.24 \"The Trout Motor\" One day a spoilt and stubborn child went for a walk in the garden with her over-anxious father. The bored child saw the long-forgotten swing and wanted to get on it. Hurrying after the running child, the anxious father sat her carefully on the seat and told his moody offspring how to sit on it prop-"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"erly. He then swung his little daughter carefully backwards and forwards, while she just sat there stiffly and unbendingly like some figure from a tragicomedy. After a short time both had enough of t h i s unrewarding activi- ly and side by side they continued their unhappy walk, if nothing more than to stimulate their appetites by the movement. They had scarcely disappeared before a poor, wild little girl, entirely left to her own devices, who had watched the uninspired goings-on, stood in front of the forbidden and therefore mu ch envied swing. After a quick look around that the coast was clear, the tomboy was instantly astride the mechanically well-built swing. She pu lled her feet in and arched her body far back, swung forwards, shifted her weight, swung backwards and after a few swings stood up on the brown polished seat with legs wide apart and as she swung to and fro allowed her sunburnt hands to slide up and down the ropes. In so doing the point was soon reached where the ropes were par- allel to the ground. She then changed her position again. She brought her feet together and spread he r arms so as to rotate herself rhythmically about the longitudinal axis of her body, to the right on the foreswing and to the left on the backswing, all the while remembering to shift her weight for- wards and backwards. In this way the swinging action turned into a round dance. The length of each swing becam e longer and longer and she swung higher and higher. A few moments late r the ropes were almost vertical, backwards again one last time and just before the point of culmination was reached, the child quickly flung herself in the opposite direction about the longitudinal axis, 24 thereby abruptly braking her body, which wanted to continue its original path about this axis. The effect of this purely intuitive manoeuvre was amazing. Her body hurtled fo rwards and, as occurs when a last-sliding toboggan collides with an obstacle, was thrown in a high curve over the top rail of the swing, i.e. the earlier back and forth motion had become circular. In this faster and faster circular flight the backwards and forwards motion of the body become smaller and smalle r and ultimately only a slight swaying back and forth c ould be observed. This took place at longer and longer intervals, finally resulting in a rhythmical looping motion, the difference between height and width of swing becoming almost indistinguishable, because the body now winds itself like a snake about the longitudinal axis. Eventually the child grew tired of this activity which was so fascinating to the onlooker. A stiff jerk went th rough the child's body. The whole swing shook from the sudden braking recoil . The cycles became noticeably slower. Now the second critical moment arrived, namely the necessary damping of 24 Here is some difficulty in describing this process accurately since there are no accompanying dia- grams. Here the longitudinal axis would appear to be the one about which the swing rotates, name- ly the top rail from which it is suspended. - Ed"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"the momentum before the 'dead' point of culmination was reached. At the actual moment all that could be noticed was a twitching, somewhat angular movement of the body. Even the effect of this rhythm-destroying movement is astonishing. For a moment the seat of the swing hung motionless in the air almost a whole metre below the culmination point before swinging downwards once more. In the same inst ant the child returned to the seat and allowed the swing to move without influencing it further, until with shorter and shorter swings , alternately to the right and then to the left, 25 it eventually came to rest. The child gave the impression that she had come back to Earth from another world. Slowly brushing her hair back, she looked about rather nervously, tilted her head from one side to the other and listened with lowered eyebrows, thereby unconsciously intercepting all vital sound waves through the slightly inclined attitude of her head. A moment later she stood in front of the swing and remembered to bring it to a complete standstill. In a few leaps and bounds she reached the hedge and bending down, slipped through it like an eel. Apart from the slight swaying of the swing, nothing remained to betr ay the fact that this nature-attuned child had solved a problem over which countless astute thinkers had racked their brains in vain. This concerns the curve or curved path with which it is possible to over- come the 'dead' point. This curve has been particularly well mastered by the millipede, which would hardly be able to walk at all were it ever to reflect on how and when to move its 1,000 feet at the right time. Even the slow snail would barely be able to move were it to ponder the problem of setting its caterpillar-like locomotive works in motion such that movement in a straight line would result from the si nuous movement of its underbelly. The same sort of movement also enables the pike, with a looping flick of its tail, to dart forwards like an arrow to seize its prey. And now to a second example, which elucidates the pro-cess 26 in a some- what different light. The Trout From Implosion Magazine, No.19, \"Our Mo tion is Wrong\" & No.7, \"Nature as Teacher\" I would like to explain, in a very uns cientific way, how the old foresters, huntsmen and fishermen and their wive s at the spinning-wheel, recounted old fairy-tales as they sought to explai n the mysterious perseverence of the 25 This would appear to confirm the interpretation that the obs erver was looking at the swing from the side and that the longitudinal axis of the sw ing is therefore centred along the top rail. - Ed. 26 Sometimes Viktor separat es prefixes with a hyphen through which the function of the prefix is accentuated - Ed"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"trout standing motionless in the axis of flowing springwater. It was rumoured that in such springs the soul s of the departed were to be found. They were supposed to be slowly re leased from their decomposing earthly remains in the cool womb of Mother Earth. Gradually coming together in desceending streams and migrating ups tream along them, the souls became charged with a purifying ascending cu rrent upon reaching the spring. This current also draws up a little springwater in its wake, which then enables it to rise heavenwards. As a four-year old, I wanted to have a close look at this migration of souls and in the process fe ll into the ice-cold water. The maid- servant fished me out and administered stout blows, and in doing so she shook the water out of my lungs and stomach. She then took me into the kitchen and angrily sat me down on the kitchen sideboard, where my shocked mother took over. While my clothes were being changed, she deliv- ered an unforgettable lecture. \"You silly boy! How dare you go to the water! The poor souls of the departed migrate through the water towards the m ountains and are resurrected at the springs and carried up to Heaven by the ur-force of all life. They entrance you, pull you in, you drown and die, and then you have to go with them. When you are grown up, but not before, you can go to the water's edge. When you're older, and you have pressing problems and no l onger know what to do or how to help yourself, go to the waters of mountain springs. There you will find me again, for there my soul will be. I will then give you moth erly advice and help you when I am no longer on this Earth.\" Thirty years later, as a young forester, I was going to lose my job due to the inexploitability of the timber in re mote stands of the forest reserve. The forest was to be administered by a cheaper game-keeper instead. Standing near a crystal-clear mountain stream, I remembered my mother's words. Ruminatively I gazed into the fast-flo wing water, which rose from a crack in the rocks a few hundred metres higher up. I murmured into it. Disappointed because my mother's spirit did not answer, I sought to cross over the metre-wide stream using my st aff as a vaulting pole. I tried to find a secure purchase for the end of my staff on the smooth, rocky stream-bed. In the process I flushed a stationary trout from its lair, which fled upstream like lightning. Two questions shot through my mind. Firstly, how do trout reach this high location, because a kilometre downs tream the water plunges 60 metres (180ft) and is atomised into a veil of mist? Secondly, just how was it possible that there, right in the axis of the current, a large number of fish were able to stand so effortlessly motionless. They steered themselves with but slight movements of their tail-fins, both ove rcoming their own weight and the specific weight of the heavy water flowing against them? On closer inspec- tion this became clearer. Was this movement of the trout the mysterious"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"pointer given by my mother in relation to what she had once said? Was this the sign she promised me? Was it th e souls migrating towards the moun- tains that drew the fish along in their wake? Or did an axial, biomagnetic force prevail which also prevented the downstream acceleration of heavy logs, and yet which, through mysterious counter-forces of suction, made their transport down the central axial po ssible? Suddenly I had a vision of a machine that woul d overcome gravity. In this way I discovered the animalistic magnetism of earth, sap and blood, which enables the naturally fl owing, planetarily inward-spiralling water-masses to maintain their steadiness of flow in variable gradients. This steadying force is rendered inoperative if the watercourse is regulated and straightened out. It is also extinguished if springwater is centrifuged in high-speed, steel pressure-turbines. It was during the spawning season on a bright moonlit night in the early part of the year. I was sitting near a waterfall on the lookout for a dangerous fish poacher who used to throw bottle s of unslaked lime into ponds imme- diately below the waterfalls. These ponds were always full of fish. The result of this was that whole streams were emptied of fish due to lime- explosions and the cauterising of the fishes' gills. What occurred that night happened so fast that there was hardly any time to register what actually took place. In the bright moonlight, which fell on the water at the right angle, every movement of the numerous fish could be discerned in the crys- tal-clear water. Suddenly the fish scattered in all directions. The reason for their flight was the appearance of a particularly large trout which came up from below, made for the base of the waterfall and immediately began to swim around it. These movements, which seemed to describe the shape of an egg, were akin to those of the child mentioned previously, who swung on the swing in a naturalesque way. It seemed as t hough the trout was rocking itself to and fro in strongly pronounced looping movements. It was dancing a sort of reel in the swirling water. All at once it disappeared under the fall of water, which fell like liquid metal into the pond. The trout suddenly stood up on its tail and in the conically convergi ng stream of water I perceived a wild movement like a spinning top, the cause of which wa s not immediately apparent. Having temporarily disappear ed, the trout then re-emerged from this spinning movement and floate d motionlessly upwards. Upon reaching the underside of the topmost curve of the waterfall it did a quick somersault in a high curve upstream (backwards like that of the child) and with a loud smack was thrown beyond the upper curvat ure. With a powerful flick of its tail-fins it disappeared. My head full of thoughts, I filled my pipe and smoked it until it went out. All concern for the expected arrival of the poacher was forgotten. In deep"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"thought I returned home. Later on I often saw how trout playfully sur- mounted high waterfalls, in this case 6 metres (19ft) high. How and why they were able to do this, however, I only discovered years later as a result of other observations which happened one after the other like a string of pearls. No scientist was ever able to explain this phenomenon to me. The Ox From TAXI Magazine, No.146 (June 1939), p. 30 \"The Ox & the Chamois\" Anyone, who has observed the appalli ng cruelty suffered by wretched draught-animals in the difficult and dangerous transport of logs in the mountains, will understand why I have concentrated my whole mind and thoughts on the possibility of bringing this, in any case worthless timber, down into the valley without the brains of oxen. My many suggestions for transporting timber by water were always rejected because this traditional system of transport usually causes such damage to streams that it is more economic to build forest roads and railways. They are excessively expensive to operate but nevertheless are cheaper than the subsequent damage which becomes evident in any stream-channel after a short time. Reference was always made to Archimedes' famous principle: heavy beech-logs do not float and so on scientific grounds alone it would be Utopian to take into account such foolish suggestions for water-transport. My father had transported hundreds of thousands of solid cubic metres of beech over large distances. He never allowed this work to be carried out by day but as a rule on moonlit nights. As my father always explained, water irradiated by the Sun becomes tired an d lazy, rolls itself up and sleeps. Whereas, during the night and especial ly in moonlight, it becomes fresh and lively so that it is able to carry pine and beech logs heavier than water. All my arguments for water transport were dismissed as ridiculous fantasies. Thus one day I found myself once again behind a heavily-overloaded log- sledge, which, under a torrent of abuse and cracks of the whip, the wretched team of oxen had to drag over the moun tain,. The poor beasts careered down- hill, spreading wide their four legs, eyes bulging with fear, because the teamster did not wish to apply brake-chai ns and spoil the good snow-track. No friendly suggestions helped to alleviate the lot of the poor oxen under the yoke. Due to his paltry wages, the man was barely able to cover his expenses. What now happened I chalk up to a kindly fate with which wise Nature came to my assistance, without my having an inkling of its ramifica- tions at the time. As a rule, the oxen, cringing with fear on the descent into the valley under withering whip-cracks, ha d to approach the next rise at the gallop, and on this occasion one of the oxen collapsed. Having become "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"thoroughly entangled, all attempts to ge t this ox back on its feet failed. \"Shame you fell down! Now you'll just have to learn how to get up again!\" fumed the bemused peasant, and in a fury he began to strike the poor beast. The more I yelled at the angry man, the more he flailed at the animal. Finally the ox convulsed, dropping its foaming mouth onto the hard-packed snow. Out of its crushed eyes the last of its spirit glistened like tears. The very next moment the man got out a halter with numerous silver clappers, which he passed over the standing oxen, sliding it over the humped back of the recumbent ox. Whereupon the blinded ox took such fright that with one heave it stood up on its four quivering legs again and in doing so tossed the peasant head over heels. The man took a long time to stand up again. Once this stalwart fe llow had recovered his balance, he rubbed his nose backwards and forwards, ri ght and left with the back of his hand. Quietly taking a sledge-hammer, he knocked away the retaining chains so that the logs tumbled th underingly down the slop e. \"Mr Forester, our agreement is at an end\", he declar ed. Taking his oxen by the yoke-strap and grinning sardonically, he returned to the cabin to inform his colleagues of the happy end to hi s misbegotten contract. A few hours later all the ox-teams left and I stood utterly alone in the for- est, pondering on how I could get the al ready-sold timber down to the val- ley. Forced to act quickly, I had an improvised weir and sluice-gate erected, and without the slightest hesitation I had the logs thrown into the forest stream, which was beginning to rise ow ing to the meltwater. In the early morning the logs floated downstream without difficulty. The Sun had hard- ly blinked on the water before the logs sank and would not be budged from the spot. It was only in the late evening that the water came alive again, and in this way, avoiding certain times of day, I brought the logs, with only a few exceptions, down into the valley by night. Only in a deep ravine, where no ray of sunlight fell on the water, did the 'sinkers' 27 remain lying. No surge of water was able to stir these waterlogged timbers from where they lay. Curiously enough, in the followi ng summer, however, on the occasion of a warm rain these stragglers turned up, whereupon I noticed that they no longer lay flat, but were floating half upright. Accustomed to observe all natural phenomena very keenly, it quickly became clear to me that the Sun's rays are able to produce many effects undreamt of by our learned scientists. At any rate, the good Archimedes had overlooked many things in this re gard so even in those days I had already lost faith in the ancient Gree ks. It only became clear to me later on that old Isaac Newton, the deified Mayer 28 with his law of the conservation 27 'Sinkers': Colloquial term for logs heavier than water - Ed, 28 This refers to the German phys icist, Julius Robert von Mayer (1814-1878), who contributed to the formulation of the Law of Conservation of Energy. - Ed ."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"of energy, and the botanists with their law of heliotropism, had all erred. Once again, kind Fate came to my aid, and I will relate how this was mani- fested in a practical way. Dancing Logs and Stones From Implosion Magazine, No.7, \"Dancing Stones\" & TAU Magazine, No.146, \"The Chamois\" On a particularly cold December morning after the above event had occurred, I was stalking a very powerful buck in the ravine where the logs always came to rest. It was a loner a nd seldom seen. I was just about to abandon the fruitless hunt when a small trickle of snow on the steeply- inclined walls caught my eye. Imme diately afterwards the shrill warning call of the concealed chamois reached my ears, and at last I espied the much sought-after beast standing behind a dw arf pine. The situation was extreme- ly tricky, because once shot, the cham ois would inevitably plunge into the almost inaccessible ravine and in all probability smash its magnificent horns. In the end the hunting spirit got the upper hand. Under fire the good buck collapsed, slipped and fell head over heels over the edge. A moment later I heard it hit the ice-sheet at the bottom of the ravine far below with a dull thud. \"Damn!\" I thought to myself, \"Now the horns will be broken and the beard will freeze and lose its beautiful symmetry!\". It was hard to know what to do next. For hours I tried to find somewh ere to climb down. Suddenly I slipped and tumbled into the ravine down the ic y path of an avalanche. Using my staff as a brake, I landed luckily on a heap of snow. Overjoyed, I caught sight of the chamois, which fortunate ly had not fallen through the ice and into the water. A minute later I stood over it, and, admiring its horns and beard, I began to remove them. I lifte d up its body and attached it securely to the carrying strap, taking its entrails over to an area of open water which lay a short way upstream, in order to repay the fish for my having disturbed their night's peace. Having slit open the entrails with a knife to release the gases, I watched them sink slowly towards the bottom until they finally lay on the sandy riverbed. At this point the water was several metres deep, crystal-clear and totally still. While washing my sweaty hands, I noticed many 'sinkers' about 4m (13ft) below. They were performing a remarkable dance. It was as though the logs lying in the absolutely still water had become magnetic. Now and then the bu tt of one log lifted, floated upwards slightly, laying itself a few feet over another log, only to recoil in the oppo- site direction the very next moment as if in fright. Ch amois, horns and beard were forgotten! H our upon hour passed. I was un able to drag myself away from this extraordinary spectacle. Gradually evening fell and with it"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"came an even keener chill. Suddenly a heavy log stood straight up, paused for a moment, and with a lurch shot out of the water, to be encircled imme- diately with an Elizabethan-style ruff of ice. Soon the other logs began to perform the same witches' dance. Fo r a few minutes several logs, girdled with an ice necklace and projecting a bout 10cm (4 in.) above the surface, swayed to and fro in the water as if alive. Indeed, even more marvellous events were about totake place! For a long time I lay on the ice and observed the action at the bottom of the icy-cold stream. There! I couldn't believe my eyes! There was a strange activity amongst the variously-sized stones lying on the bed. A few were as large as a hu man head and began to come to life. For a long time they played the same game as the logs did earlier, first approaching each other only immediately to recoil. Flouting all the laws of gravity they drifted about, attracting and repelling each other. At first I thought that the stones might be electrically charged. I remembered the phe- nomenal luminescence 29 given off by such milky-coloured stones which leave yellowish-gold comet-tails behi nd them when rubbed together under water. This phenomenon is what had ap parently given rise to the legendary Rhinegold in the 'Song of the Nibelungs'. All of a sudden a large, head-sized stone began to gyrate slowly in circles like the trout at the waterfall before it begins to float upw ards. It was egg- shaped. The very next moment the stone was at the surface right before my very eyes. It was quickly encircled by a visibly-growing collar of ice and this apparently-possessed, gently rocking stone, floated on the full-moonlit sur- face of the water, just as the heavy beech-logs had done earlier on. Soon a second, then a third, and still more stones, all making the same manoeuvres, rose to the surface of the water. The water soon looked like a cake bespeck- led with raisins. Eventually almost all the milky-white stones that had been smoothed and rounded rose to the surf ace. The remaining rough, angular stones which had fallen in from the ba nks were left motionless on the bed of the stream. At the time I took no account of the precise angle of the incident moon- beams, which make lunatics walk about on roofs. Naturally I had no idea that this involved a concentrative proce ss, nor did I realise the significance of the oxygen-concentrating effects of the chill on this bitterly cold night of the full Moon. This cold concentration giv es rise to the emission of expansive emanations, which lead to the creation of the 'original' 30 form of motion. It is this form of movement that overcomes gravity and raises the specifically 29 This refers to triboluminescence, which is the energy, expressed as light, given off by electrons returning to their rest-orbits after having been excited due to the pressure arising when stones are rubbed together. This emis sion of energy is a nett gain to the overall energy-content of water.

As a huntsman I was well aware that female physical masses, charged w ith negative ions, become fiery when handled coolly. 1 also knew that in their hunger for reactive substances (semen or fertilisation) these female bodies, known to triumph over the male when they succumb, were able to overcome not only their own weight, but also that of their superi mposed load. What I found ha rd to believe was that, apart from negating their own weight, th ese stones were also able to over- power the watery resistance to motion pressing down upon them. Although at the time I was unaware that this process was the starting- point for the explanation of atomic tran sformation, it nevertheless made me decide to be even more observant in the future. As a result further events unfolded which, understandably, appear highly mystical to scientists, but which in reality are completely natu ral manifestations of the forces of Nature. Without them there would be no life and movement in this fascinat- ing world. My main concern of the moment, however, was how to remove the chamois, which by this time had become firmly frozen in the ice, and how to climb out of the ravine in the middle of the night together with my buck. Luckily it was a glorious full Moon lit night. I turned my steps home- ward over an ice-bridge that had formed. Many years later I learned that this natural phenomenon, which has still not been explained scientifically, was an everyday occurrence on the River Angara, the outflow from Lake Baikal, and enabled the farmers to cross this bridgeless river in winter. In any event, I was fundamentally cu red of whatever school knowledge I had left. On this day the relentless battle with established scientists began. I had unfortunately greatly underestimated these scient ists, because I had no idea how dangerous is this species of human being. Without the faithful support of several women and the fighting comradeship of Werner Zimmermann I might perhaps have pe rished, as had many other discover- ers before me. Thus this enquirer after truth, Zimmermann, also became part of my destiny. His Tau magazine brought me much joy and I am ever grateful to him for his constant encouragement. It greatly helped me to close the circle in order to show people previously unknown processes that Nature employs in her technology. Goethe was perhaps the only person who perceived these true processes of Nature. I quote: All things into one are woven, each in each doth act and dwell As cosmic forces, rising, falli ng, charging up this golden bell With heaven-scented undulations, piercing Earth from powers sublime. Harmonious all and all-resounding, fill they universe and time! 31 This refers to the specific weight of the stones relative to the specific weight of the water, which equals 1 and is the base value fo r all definition of specific weight. In Viktor Schauberger's view it also refers to the difference between the weight of mattered imbued with life (specific weight) and dead matter (absolute weight). - Ed."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Amidst life's tides in raging motion I ebb and flood - I waft to and fro!

The Interchange of Substances in Nature From Implosion Magazine, No.7, p. 6 \"Nature as Teacher\" Most people have heard of the phenome non of St Elmo's fire. It consists of bright flashes of light which emerge from the tips of treetops and give off a fiery glow. Why and how it occu rs has so far not been explained. A similar phenomenon was shown to me, and again it was when I was hunting. As a newly-fledged Wildme ister I was given permission to shoot my first game-cock. Naturally it would have to be the largest in the 30,000 acre forest-Eldorado and I became more a nd more excited at the prospect. The old forest warden, who often gave me advice, had explained to me that there was a legendary mountain cock, an age- old campaigner, that lived in an almost inaccessible hidden valley. No im perial highness, no serene duke, no degenerate prince and no doddery old ba ron had ever managed to enter this valley. The entrance to this gorge had b een sealed off by a rock-slide. Access was extremely dangerous and only possible with a climbing rope. One afternoon I stood for a while in front of this sheer, insuperable barri- er. To the right there was an almost vertical wall of rock and to the left a 100m (328ft) waterfall, with flat areas of rock-face on each side, as slippery as an eel. One slip and my earthly rema ins could be carried home in a hand- kerchief. I spent a long ti me throwing up the grappling hook before it final- ly became lodged at a height ot herwise inaccessible from the ground. Whether it would hold or not in the crumbling, weather-beaten spur of rock was a matter of conjecture. After one or two attempts to tear it loose, the"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"ascent began, step by step, and with trembling knees I finally reached the top. After a short rest I pressed on into the virginal high-mountain gorge in which no-one had set fool perhaps for decades. The chamois I encountered during my climb eyed me warily, but did not see fi t to give their piping, warning call. Apparently they were still unaware of the danger this huntsman represente d, but they avoided this two-legged monster all the same. Indeed they we re hardly bothered at all by their Wildmeister, which I found quite infuria ting and because of this I struck out at a dwarf-pine bush from behind which an old chamois doe emerged with a flyi n g leap. Instead of running away, ho wever, it came closer out of curiosity and to have a better look at the odd creature that had disturbed its light feed- ing. Eventually I entered a small primev al forest, which spread over the few acres at the foot of the sheer north f ace of the crags and in which old spruce, large larches and other species of overs torey and understorey were growing. It was exactly what a proper primeval forest should be. After a brief search, I found the courtship display-ground and saw by the droppings that the old warrior perched on a gnarled branch every morning to sing his lovesong. I carefully circled the roosting tree in order to find the right place to ambush the cock the following morning. By evening all I wanted to do was to bring the mountain-cock down with a not so harmonious and silent ball of shot. Meanwhile evening had come a nd darkness quickly fell. It was the night of the new Moon and was darker than I had ever experienced before. Half-sitting, I leant up against my bivou ac tree, wrapped up in my weather- proof cloak and kept as still as a mouse, lest I frighten the cock away. A quite eerie silence descended. In the raven-black night it was almost impos- sible to see my outstretched hand. It was chilly and shivering, I huddled even further into the broad folds of my cloak. From time to time I dozed off and lost all sense of time and place. It could well have been towards midnight that it all began. A small reddish flame flared up from the floor of the forest in front of me. At first I thought I had been careless when lighting my pipe a nd had set fire to the forest. However, I had been nowhere near the place where the fire started. It must be a will- o'-the-wisp, I thought, and continued to watch it. But when a fiery egg arose from the ground, I thought my eyes were playing tricks. With its narrower end pointing downwards, it stood quite immobile on a mound-like rise and gave off a pale yellow glow. I was already on my feet and stared at this uncanny spectacle, shaking with fright and cold. It grew larger and larger and eventually was about two metres high and a metre wide. It was a mag- nificent, but unearthly sight. I wanted to run away as fast as I could, remembering the stories of the supernatural told at the spinning wheel on the winter nights of childhood. Having listened to them, the pretty or not so pretty farmer's daughters no"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"longer dared to return home alone and were absolutely delighted whenever the young men accompanied them. It was not without ulteri or motives that the latter recounted these horror stories, for in so doing they received their well-earned reward. Had these maidens not been willing, and this one can- not know, they might have impaled th emselves on the horn of a different more awesome devil. Thus it was that the terrified girls generally chose the lesser of the two evils. But where was I to run? All I could do w as to take a firm grip on my shot- gun and warily approach this glowing light. The closer I came, and I cannot deny it, the more my knees shook. And then I actually stood right next to this colourless light. It floated a fe w centimetres above a small mound cov- ered with snow-white flowers. Carefully I held my steel-tipped staff in the flame. I smelled nothing and felt no h eat. Becoming curious, I then held my hand in this glowing egg, but felt nothi ng, nor did I see the shadow of my hand. I then lifted the turf under the egg with the end of my staff. Nothing moved. Slowly I retreated to my tree, keeping my eyes fixed on the flame. Eventually it began to fade and go out . All at once the spook was over. It was replaced by a conspicuous warmth and gradually the dawn began to break. When I saw the mountain-cock in the broad daylight, I lost all desire to shoot it. The old battler with his sp arse tail-feathers and bedraggled plumage, looked thoroughly worn out. If stuffed it wouldn't have been much of a trophy and because of this I spared its life. A few days later I shot another cock, which to this day ador ns my wall. Still pondering the events of the night before, I returned to th e mound above which the night fire had flared. Delicate flowers of unparalleled beauty covered the whole mound, upon whose petals extra-large dewdrops stood. I had yet another experi- ence, for when I touched them, they fell to the ground as though they had been struck by a blow. I then investigated the ground underneat h, lifting the sod with my staff. There was nothing to be se en and I was just about to cease my examination, when I felt a resistance. What I found was a large chamois horn. As I opened up the earth further, I found my self standing over a chamois grave- site filled with many, we ll-preserved horns. Fr om old foresters I had already heard that the chamois, when they sense their impending death, seek out a common grave in out of the way places. Before leaving, I covered the grave up again. It might have been an act of piety. Why I didn't dig up the rest of the almost undecomposed horns, I still don't know. But, I was enriched by an experience, however, which would later help to explain the secret of th e transmutation of ma tter.

(Implosion Magazine, No.51, p.23) The coat-of-arms of the Schauberger family consists of a broken tree- trunk entwined by a wild dog-rose. The family motto is \"Fidus in Silvis Silentibus\" (Be faithful to the silent forests). Once upon a time there was a castle on the Schauberg. Betrayed, the last sons of this robber-baron were impr isoned by the Archbishop of Passau. The eldest was beheaded and the youngest pardoned and sent into exile. This last remaining Schauberger was ba nished to the prim eval forests sur- rounding the Dreisesselberg. He settled on the shores of Lake Plockenstein and led the life of a forest bailiff in charge of law and order in the area under his jurisdiction. It was from him that the Schaubergers are descended, who uninterruptedly dwelt in this forest isolation as forest wardens and game- keepers, fishermen and foresters for almost a 1,000 years. The wild dog-rose that wound itself about the broken trunk, from which it drew its life-force, symbolically depi cted the more beautiful form of new life, which supports itself by entwining about the dead life-form. No doubt those who looked down from the mountain (schau = look; berg = mountain) were able to perceive the origins and causes of this eternal becoming and passing away, and with its blossom also inherited the gift of seeing into the most secret of Nature's processes. Although they served under the bishop's crook for 1,000 years, they had just as little time for religious doctrine as they had for scientific facts. They relied on their own eyes and their inborn, intuitive abilities. Above all they knew of the inner healing power of water and understood how to achieve a striking increase in the yield of adjacen t fields and pastures with the special 49"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"shape of their irrigation channels, which however, were only operated at night. Their principal preoccupation, however, was directed towards the conservation of the forest and wild game. From time to time floodwaters uncovered the very special bank structures of the mountain streams, which in these forest districts were used to raft timber. These constructions forced the water to rotate to right and left in ser- pentine, spiral curves. The concept of the 'cycloid-spiral space-curve' was naturally unknown to them. Strangely however, they used it ably enough in the construction of so-called timber or water chutes. Through the rhythmi- cal alternation of these flow-directi ng devices both water and logs were endowed with such grace, that in certain sections of the flumes they even flowed uphill, flouting the laws of gravity. We only need to cast our minds back to the symbolic snake of Asclepius or the biblical 'Tree of Knowledge'. Again and again we come across the coiling of a snake about a staff, a rod or a tree as the symbol of the particular type of movement associated with, and conducive to, cognitive power. From earliest youth, all I wanted to do was to become a forester or a hunter, as my father, grandfather, grea t grandfather and great, great grand- father had been before me. My father wanted to force me to follow the high- er career of a public servant. My mother on the other hand secretly supported me and always urged, \"Stay in the calling of your forebears, who in their day honoured the family motto, 'Be fa ithful to the silent forests'\". When I was introduced to the forest reserve by an old forester, my dream began to turn into reality in a way that I could not have imagined better. After the end of the First World War I was able to take over the manage- ment of a hunting reserve because an old forester had been pensioned off. It was an extremely remote hunting estate, and because of this it was most beautiful. Although I didn't see eye to ey e with my superior - a forestry commissioner who treated me very c ondescendingly - I quickly gained the confidence of Prince Adolf zu Schaumburg-Lippe, to whom the hunting estate belonged. He married shortly thereafter and I won the appreciation of the beautiful young Princess when, on her birthday she shot her first buck, a mighty twelve-pointer, which I had summ oned for her with a conch-shell in true hunting tradition. One day while out stalking, the Princess confided to me that her husband was worried about losing his estate due to the changed circumstances of the post-war period. The Prince had had to forfeit much of his capital and could only keep his estat e if it could be made to return a profit. A long time before this happened, I had submitted my plan to the Estate Administration for reducing the cost of transporting timber by 90%. However, it had been rejected by my superiors as unfeasible, for they believed that in accordance with Archimedes' Law it would be impossible to float the heavy"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"beech and oak logs, which were heavier than water. Coming from a middle- class background, the Princess had a more open mind. She had heard about my plan for a log-flume and intuitively felt that it might possibly be the sav- ing of the hunting estate. She had also heard of the timber merchant's attempt to bribe me to reveal my plan to th em. Quite out of the blue she asked me, \"How much did the timber merchant offer you?\" \"Three times my annual salary,\" I answered. Suddenly she stood still and asked me directly, \"What is your esti- mate of the savings in costs that could be achieved with your log-flume? Today it costs about 12 schillings per solid cubic metre to bring the logs down to the sawmill. 30,000 cubic metres are felled every year. This amounts to 360,000 schillings per annum. What would it cost if your installation were to be built?\" I replied, \"One schilling per cubic metre, including the cost of amortising the installation\". The Prince's annual contribution towards the upkeep of the hunting estate amounted to 80,000 schillings, and the Princess had quickly calculated the cost- savings, and with them the saving of th e property. \"Great!\" she declared, \"It will be done!\". My only stipulation, howeve r, was that I was to have total free- dom to act and negotiate the constructi on of the log-flume, for which I would also assume full responsibility. The Prin cess kept her word. I had no idea of the risk I had taken on. However, luck never failed me even in the trickiest situa- tions. At the right moment I was able to make an observation, the far-reaching effects of which I was able to appreciate in their entirety only years later. About four months later the flume was finished. The large logs were stacked in readiness. One day I made a preliminary test. An average-sized log was introduced into the mouth of the flume. It floated down about 100m and sud- denly stuck on the bottom. The oncoming water backed up and the flume overflowed. I saw the faces full of scor n and malicious glee. I perceived the implications of this fail ure at once and was totally aghast. I had the stranded log removed. My diagnosis was that ther e was too little water and that the gra- dient was too steep. I was at a complete loss and sent all my workers home in order to ponder the problem in peace and quiet. The curves were properly arranged, of that there was no doubt. What was to blame for this malfunction? Those were my thoughts as I slowly walked alongside the flume until I reached the weir further down, where the logs were snigged and sorted and to which another flume was connected. The weir was full. I sat down on a pro- jecting rock in the warm sunlight and looked down into the water. Through my leather breeches I suddenly felt something scrabbling under- neath me. I sprang up and saw a snake that had been coiled up on the spot where I had chosen to sit. I flung it away from me and it flew into the water, whereupon it swam straight towards the bank and tried to get out. It was unable to do so, however, because the ro ck face was too steep. In its search for a way out it cast about hither an d thither and eventually swam right across the dam. I watched it and was suddenly struck by the thought: how"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"can the snake swim as fast as an arrow without any fins? I took out my spy- glass and observed the peculiar looping movement of the snake's body under the crystal-clear water. A moment later it reached the far side and was gone. For quite a while I stood there as though turned to stone. In my mind's eye I reviewed the snake's every movement, which had twisted about in such a curious fashion under the water. It consisted of a wave-like combina- tion of vertical and horizontal curves. In a flash I understood the process. It was the snake that had showed me double spiral motion. An hour later I had reached my workers in the hut just as they were cook- ing their meal. I gave them specific inst ructions. \"Finish your meal as quickly as you can! Three men are to go to the sawmill. Ask the manager for a wagon and bring about 300 larch slats to the upper weir!\" The men looked at me askance. The foreman, a Tyrolean, interjected, \"Wha t do you want to do with the slats?\". I cut him short and told him just to do what I had ordered. I took the mas- ter-builder with me and we went up to the induction weir. I told him, \"You will receive double your wages, and together with your men you will nail the slats to the walls of the flume in the way that I will show you, even if you have to work through the night by torch-light. I will be there myself all th e while.\" The master- builder shrugged his shoulders and nodded. A few hours later the wagon arrived, and also the man who had been sent to the forester's house to fetch the nails. The whole night was filled w ith the sound of hammers. I carefully inspected the counter-curves in the bends of the flume, which were to force the water to twist in the flume in the same way as the snake in the weir. Towards midnight I returned home. There was a memorandum from the inspecting Chief Forestry Commissioner, to the effect that tomorrow at ten in the morning the Prince, Princess and several experts and specialists would be present to observe the trial run. I slowly laid the note aside and pondered what to do next. At eight in the morning the men could have fin- ished their work, if they worked right through the night. I took my staff and gun and reached the site in an hour. While still some distance off I heard the sound of hammers and saw the glow of the forest workers' bicycle lamps, used for riding to work in the early hours of the morning. \"When will you be finished?\", I called out to them from so me distance. The master-builder esti- mated that it could be done by nine in the morning. I promised everyone that they would all receive three times their hourly rate of pay if they could finish by eight. They did it by 7.30. I then said to them, \"Go and have your breakfast now, because I'll need you at the induction sluice at 9.30. There is still an hour's work to be done, and then you'll all have a day off on double pay.\" The mast er-builder suggested that I also rest awhile, because I wouldn't be able to hold out much longer. I declined all further conversation with a wave of my hand and went over to the induc-"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"lion sluice. There I waited until my people returned, and shortly thereafter the Prince and Princess arrived together with my bitter adversaries, the experts and specialists. I greeted the royal couple and the chief forestry commissioner. I never even gave the others a glance. The Princess looked at me with a worried air and the old rafting-master lolled against a post with a sardonic grin. I ordered the sluice-gate to be opened . Behind me my workers prodded sev- eral slender logs into the water, shov ing a 90cm diameter log unobtrusively aside. \"No! No!\" the old rafting mast er suddenly yelled out, \"Put the heavy one in the water too!\". I gave a quick nod and slowly the log floated towards me, barely sticking out of the water. Soon it reached the flume intake and dammed the water, causing the water-l evel in the weir slowly to rise. Nobody uttered a word. Everyone was staring at the log as it rose up with the water. The very next instant the flume would have to overflow. All at once a gurgling sound erupted; the heavy log swung slightly to the right and to the left, and twisting like a snake, it then sped off down the flume, head high, like an arrow. Having described an elegant curve, a few seconds later it was out of sight. Ev erybody stood looking after it. Shaking his head, the old rafting-master spat in to the flume in a high, arching curve, fished his tobacco plug from his toothl ess mouth with his forefinger, threw it into the water and grunted, \"Goddammit, it actually works!\". Not having understood, the Prince enquired what th e rafting-master had said. I stam- mered that it was only a quotation from Gotz of Berlichingen. 32 \"Yes indeed, it certainly was!\" agreed the chief forestry commissioner quickly. Grabbing my staff and gun, I quickly took my leave and climbed up into the forest and was away. Once out of sight I sat down on a rock with gun and staff between my knees and mopped the cold sweat from my brow. \"Once only and never again!\" I thought to myself. Ha d I not sat on the sn ake at that cru- cial moment, my life would now not have been worth living. A few days later the decree arrived making me the director of the large hunting and forest reserve. This was s oon followed with visits by experts and other specialists from all over th e world - even government ministers made their appearance. Shortly thereafter I was summoned to the Ministry of Agriculture in Vienna. It was then that the battle really started, which has continued to this very day. It was of ten very ugly and dirty. In any event, from the day that I promised the Princess that I would build the log-flume, I was never left in peace again. Galileo Galilei discovered the rotation of the Earth about the Sun, to the great agitation of the scientific and religious worlds. The Pope threatened the discoverer with excommunication.

Finally he was made to retr act and forswear by his colleagues. \"Whatever you say, it still rotates!\" were supposed to have been his last words before he died. I never paid any attention to such as Galilei, Archimedes, Robert Mayer, Isaac Newton, Pythagoras or any other formulator of energetic laws. I sim- ply observed logs or other floating bodies, which, although heavier than water, under certain conditions swam like fish. I also observed those places where these same bodies sank to the bo ttom and stayed there, even where powerful tractive forces were active in water flowing as straight as an arrow. It was the curious movements of th e swimming snake that first demon- strated the double spiral movement to me and helped me to achieve major successes. Hundreds of thousands of the heaviest logs followed the first one, as if there was no difference in their specific weight. 33 By this time it was quite clear to me why my forebe ars had organised th e rafting streams in such a way. They had formulated the rule of thumb that the timber must be floated and the wate r guided in the same way that a boar urinates. In fact the completion of the whole timber flotation system was almost prevented. One day the chief forestry commissioner, who, absolutely deter- mined to exert his authority, appeared on the site in company with the polit- ical director of the Forestry Administration. He forbade any further work, thereby placing the completion of the whol e, well-conceived project at risk. I was forced to explain my whole concep t and plan to a large investigating commission. The commission was made up of senior forestry officials under the chairmanship of the chief officer of local government, all of whom were antagonistic towards me. These gentlemen maintained that an 18m high dam wall I had designed and built would not be able to withstand the pressure of water. It would col- lapse when the mass of water exerted pressure on this far too flimsy dam wall. The danger therefore arose that a disaster of unimaginable proportions would befall the villages lying below it. I watched and listened to the uncompromising attitude of the inves tigating commissioners. I was aware of the purpose of the investigation a nd had duly taken th e appropriate pre- cautionary measures. They wanted to bring about my downfall and put an end to the entire log-flume installati on. Because of this I never responded, even to the chief officer himself, but quickly descended the steps leading to 33 \"In the 2km long, constant, half-egg (point dow nwards) profiled, wooden log flume at Neuberg (Steiermark), equipped with wooden, rib-like, current guides, the temperature and velocity of the water were measured.

I took a shotgun with me and fired both barrels upstream. This was the signal for the huntsman positioned at the fully-charged upper weir, who was loyal to me, to open the large sluice-gate and let the water out. Because my only response to the chief officer's questions was to fire two shots, the commission apparently thought that I had gone mad. They demanded that I put the gun down immediately and to come up to the plat- form on which the wildly gesticulating members of the commission were standing. Suddenly a roaring noise could be hear d getting closer and closer. I point- ed upstream and around the bend a 6m high churning wall of muddy water was approaching, in which a motley assortment of logs, tree-trunks and tufts of grass were floating. \"For God's sake, get up here at once!\", yelled the chief officer. The commissioners waved th eir arms about madly, shouting at each other. From where I stood, they all looked like lunatics. I glanced side- ways at these agitated people, and standing at the centre of the dam wall, leant over it, apparently extremely interested in the height and supposed instability of the wall onto which the flood of water was about to impact. At least, that is what the commissi oners thought, who were standing above me with bated breath. The wate r did not do this. On the contrary, it hit the wall very gently and, turni ng around, thrust itself with enormous force against the wild onsl aught of the flood water. In the process the accom- panying logs were stood up almost vertically and leapt out of the mael- strom like fish (fig. 2). The dam's mill ion cubic metre storage capacity was quickly filled and the dam-wall held . Nobody dared to come down to where I was standing. The huntsman who had let the water go at my signal then appeared and, staring at the motionless figures of the commission, jumped down the steps and asked, \"Well, did it work?\". I nodded briefly, took out the empty cartridges, reloaded the gun and slowly climbed back up the steps. \"Well\", declared the chief officer, \"M ore luck than good sense!\". I looked at him from the side, allowing my gaze to follow the contours of his body and remarked, \"Sir, I believe that the lack of good sense lies on the other side\". Turning quickly, I retraced my steps. The commissioners followed, talking rapidly amongst themselves, and when th ey had finished their discussion, the chief officer called after me to say that experts would be on their way from the head office in Vienna in or der to examine the dam wall, and to determine its stability by exact static ca lculation, for although the wall actu- ally held, it was not strong enough. The experts and commissioners came again a week later. They duly carried out their investigation, made their cal- culations and came to the conclusion that because of its ingenious construc- tion, it had a safety factor of twelve - it was twelve times stronger than it need be."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Fig. 2: The dynamics of the egg-shaped holding basin. 34 34 This figure has been reproduced from the editor's own book, Living Energies, for greater clarification. - Ed.

Experience is Only Gained the Hard Way From Implosion Magazine, No.7, p.21 - \"Nature as Teacher\" It was a few years later, and another flume-weir had been built. During par- ticularly heavy rain, a sluice-gate I had designed with a particular profile was being tested for the first time an d the volume of flow carefully mea- sured. A double-spiral pipe was attached to this special gate, in which the water was made to twist around itself like a stream of urine. With this I was able to increase the flow-velocity as the head of pressure reduced. This was made possible through the generation of a spiral suction-vortex, at the cen- tre of which a white, shimmering reflux funnel 35 developed, for which there is a special cause. In this refluent can al [reflux funnel], clearly visible in almost all vortices in water, qualigenic formations 36 (ions) of an etheric and energetic nature move upstream. If these refluent substances encounter a cooler external temperature lying above them, then what I experienced at the time results. It was raining in sheets. I lay on the float, looking down into the powerful vortex. As though falling from a gutte r, the rainwater flowed from the upturned brim of my hat and into th e hole. According to the conventional theory of gravity it ought to have fallen into the vortex. However, it did not. As it fell it widened out into a cone, br oader at the base, and in this way a hat-shaped funnel formed above the lower vortex, the latter narrowing towards the bottom (fig. 3). I observed this extraordinary phenomenon very intently. But not for long, because sudde nly an ice-cold jet of water struck me right in the face. The reason was soon evident. If the water-forming ethericities flowing backwards up the refluent canal encounter an air 35 'Reflux funnel': a channel or cavity in water in which the energies move in the opposite direction to the flow of the water (as seen when flowing down a drain), and into which water can be sucked up . -Ed. 36 'Qualigenic formations': agglomerations of quality-generating substances of an ethereal nature. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" Fig. 3: The reflux jet. 37 37 This illustration has been produced by the editor for better comprehension of the phenomenon. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"temperature lower than that of the water, then the substances in which neg- ative ions are concentrated radiate expansively and prevent the entry of the water falling in the opposite direction.

I was supposed to have been officially certified as insane and sent to the lunatic asylum in Mauer- Ohling at a relatively young age because of a dare-devil stunt I perpetrated on certain esteemed members of the Ins titute of Hydraulics. I was spared this fate however, because somethin g actually worked that no one had thought remotely possible and undoubted ly baffled many intelligent minds. 38 The dam-wall I designed and buil t which, according to calculation ought to have burst, actually held . In my log-flumes heavy timbers floated which, according to Archimedes' principle, ought to have sunk to the bottom, or at least to have become stranded on the sides. Despite this the logs in my flume floated down the centre. Flouting all the laws of centrif ugal force, they described elegant inner curves when they ought to ha ve followed the outer curve of the flume-walls.

Owing to the levitational forces pre- vailing in this world of ours, that sp ecial quasi-material, quasi-immaterial substance has to float. As atomic fall out or reverting matter, it is actually heavier than its own medium. At higher altitudes this reverting matter no longer exists, for up there it is consumed by another force which, after such refreshment, becomes what I sought fo r decades as the 'specific and reactive counterforce to ever-active gravity'. Through this I came to understand why we actually have to live. I also became aware of the purpose of our mysteri- ous journey through life. It is an inte resting question that I feel reasonably equipped to answer, because my approa ch to the problem is different from other people's. For this reason some think me crazy. One day I said to myself, \"If there is a fo rce of gravity, then indubitably there has to be a force of levitation\". Since then I have been obsessed with this mys- terious prior force, remembering a familiar remonstration from childhood, \"If you hadn't climbed up, you wouldn't ha ve fallen down!\" If it were possible to discover this pre-active, antecedent fo rce, I mused further, one would only have to switch it off at the right mome nt. After a brief counteraction by the familiar force of gravity, it would have to be switched on again. At that very instant the most marvellous of marvels, perpetual motion, would be accom- plished and ready for use. Long years spent observing what we commonly call 'growth' led to the realisation that Nature ha s operated in this levity -gravity alternating way since time began. Nature directs the warm rays of the Sun onto whatever is 39 'Reversionary': Describes the pr ocess of either reverting from the physical to the purely energetic or spiritual, or vice versa. - Ed. 40 'Autarchical': In this sense also self-organisi ng, form- or structure- originating or form- or structure-bestowing motion - Ed "},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"resurrected from the Earth, whereupon all that is of too inferior a quality solidifies under the influence of fal ling and concentrating light and heat. These solidified residues then manifest themselves as a net gain, which we need as food or as the driving force lor our own bodies. From the residues t h u s bequeathed to us, we have to extract, root out or otherwise break down and ingest our own life-force in order effortlessly to overcome our own body-weight. True growth, expressed as ripeni ng, mating, reproducing, ageing and growing colder, extinguishing the life -force and relapsing into the great abdomen of the Earth, people consider a matter of course. Up to now, how- ever, no one has ever taken the trouble to investigate wh at our dear old Earth then does in order to remain et ernally young, and to be so burgeoning every spring. I was then able to pond er about the entity to wh ich the reactive rays of the Sun could do no harm, because it was the 'more sublime'. Goethe called it the 'Eternally Female'. This was of particular interest to me because he also called it the 'All-Uplifting'. It builds up everything around us that arch- es over our heads and into which day by day the Sun smiles. Perhaps it does so because physicists and technologis ts are quite incapable of conceiv- ing how our Lord ever managed to create the ever new and blossoming splendour of springtime. Ha ving ripened, whatever is too heavy wilts back into the womb of Mother Earth, only to smile at us anew in exalted form the following spring. It augments and amelio rates all that arches above us, into which the Sun roars with laughter. Up there etheric forms and even highe r entities abound. I just about man- aged to learn this while still at sch ool. These higher embodiments of evolu- tion not only rise upwards autarchically, but also draw a column of mercury up with them, which is otherwise known to sink wh en air-masses become heavy. Thus it was that this peculiar suction-force, whic h comes into being through a special form of motion calle d 'cycloid spiral space-curve motion', gave me much food for thought. Because of all this I gradually began to be filled with doubts. I could no longer fully believe in everything I was taught at school and in church. I therefore became accustomed to regard each and every small event, even if apparently quite insignificant, as a perhaps not entirely accidental clue. Accordingly, each venture into the hun ting reserve was no longer just a trip for its own sake, or undertaken to ca tch a poacher red-handed. On the con- trary, every excursion became a voyage of discovery into almost hermetical- ly-sealed and remote hunting areas, where hardly anyone had set foot before me. Much of what I saw, he ard or otherwise perceived I did not immediately understand. Ne vertheless, over the cour se of the years I was able to put the final polish on a completely new experiential paradigm."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"One day, and this w i l l be elaborated more closely later, I had two experi- ences in quick succession. I never forgot them and I can still see them very clearly in my mind. They set me many more puzzles to so lve. I was on the point of jumping over a high mountain stream with the aid of my staff. While seeking a secure hold on the smooth and slippery rock bed for its tip, I scared a large trout from its lair where it is able to feed and rest without effort. As if no law of gravity existed and as though shot from a bow, the trout darted upstream like lightning. Two questions flashed into my mind just as quickly as the trout sped upstream. One: How did this trout actually get to this spot (later I saw dozens of them in the same stream) which was cu t off by a waterfall about 100 metres high roughly a kilometre downstream? Two: What forces enabled the trout , not only to overcome its own body- weight so effortlessly and quickly, but also to overcome the weight of the water flowing against it? Many years later I finally understood the cause of this phenomenon. It is the 'cycloid-spiral space-curve'. In conj unction with reactive differences in temperature it achieves th e incredible; the overcoming of all weight through the creation of a reactive counterweigh t, generally known as the 'specific weight'. It is necessary to understand th is concept as a condition of densation pertaining to higher, more etherealised and more energetic formative enti- ties, already in a metaph ysical state of being. Having realised this, however, a great many more observations would have to be made of all th e interactions before the true causes of this levita- tion could be appreciated. It was far more difficult, however, to construct the appropriate apparatus and to determine the proper alloys with which to build it. This had first to be done in order to establish the innumerable pre- conditions that were eventually crowned with success. My obsession with this levitational force, would have remained fruitless had I not come to understand the wh ole reason for the creation of the human body. Through continual study of the processes taking place after death, I also realised that present religious ideas and world-views were either the perpetration of fraud on a gr and scale, or self-deception to which we had become accustomed ove r the course of millennia. I say this because anyone who is convi nced that metaphysical growth is possible without continual decomposition and restructuring of earthly remains through 'cycloid-spiral space-curve motion', will never get any closer to the truth; to the nature of the genuine spiritually awakening force brought about by higher reversionary infl uences. Thus it was that one day I came to understand the 'hereafter'. It is the great vault arching above us that a famous poet once called the 'Living Breath of God', which is no empty phrase.

Anyone who ca nnot receive these higher, refluent inspirations has no intuition, is aba ndoned by all benign spirits, and falls victim to these demoniac forces. Such a person is then simply a ponderer, an after-thinker, and not a fore-seer or so meone who intuits far into the future. Such a person will never understand what forces come into being when the paths of the 'disappearing' a nd the 'reappearing' intersect. One breath of air, produced through th e interaction of ac tive and reactive forms of temperature, can bowl over an elephant that has merely become slightly overheated. This is because small changes in its metabolic processes interfere with the elephant's build up of its tremendous physical strength. This not only stems from the calorie s contained in active energy-concen- trates, but in particular from reactive fi elds of qualigen. Moreover, the forces in question endow not only the elephant, but all that crawls and flies, with the original life-force. This includes the Earth itself which feeds all that it has created. This experiential mystery ride is therefore only a means to an end, its pur- pose to lay the foundations for the real build-up of energetic matter. The body's forces are on short-term loan and required for mobility. They have to assemble, transform and accumulate all that is required for the build-up of higher quality substances from the remnants of this earlier organisation of raw materials. The fundamental proposition that nothi ng can be created out of nothing was formulated by science. However, it failed to recognise the form of motion through which a densified produc t of concentrati on becomes mani- fest through the agency of the relativ ely highest-grade expansive motion. From every pore of this cycloidally-moving Earth a new entity ascends to take its place. It unfolds itself in the ante-chamber of the 'hereafter'. With the stimulating assistance of oligo-dynamic 41 , decay-furthering and catalytic recombination-enhancing influences, this negatively charged, dynamite-like formative substance consumes the fertil ising precipitates of solar energies. These solar energies must be further dissociated and dispersed by wind and other physical and mechanical dynamic impulses, becoming over-cooled in the process, in order to become the sustenance of growth and activity. 41 'Oligo-dynamic': Refers to energetic processes or physical products produced or triggered by small or subtle forces, which despite their appare nt magnitude may also be extremely powerful. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"It would take too long to describe here the marvellous processes and roundabout routes throu gh which the appropriate, nutrient-seeking e n t i t y must pass before attaining the condition generally referred to as a 'latent energy state'.

Through the cycloid circulation of the blood, the dissociated products of digestion in an anti-normal state of being will then be consumed, whereupon that which we commonly call 'life' unfolds like lightning.

Excommunication - and Little Wandering Springs From TAU Magazine, No.147 (July 1936). Today I received a warning from friendly quarters that many exposes of mine were provoking a great deal of ir ritation in certain circles which would not permit themselves to be exposed to ridicule in such a manner and would in no way take it lying down. I re plied that it was far from my inten- tion to expose anyone to ridicule: I considered the present state of affairs much too serious. That the articles I have written to date have seriously harmed me financially, I freely admit and I do not think the worse of any- body who may feel affected, when they defend themselves as best they can. When I say \"as best they can\", in no way do I sanction the exploitation of positions of authority for unfair me ans of defence as has frequently occurred, but that any defence should be so formulated that scientific circles should have no difficulty in refuting th ese attacks factually or at least in mit- igating them. Should this be impossible then even deceit will serve no pur- pose.

It these often totall y perverse practices continue to be applied, it will very soon thoroughly wipe the smiles off all our faces. As Zimmermann 42 so aptly informed rowdy stud ents at the time....\"things have already gone so far today that the will is missing even to listen to another point of view, so then those of us, who for purely personal reasons, try to suppress essential solutions vital to our existence, ar e able to cause even more harm.\" In my opinion my adversaries get so annoyed because in many instances we are concerned here with things which are so simple and natural. One has to scratch one's head as to why those, w ho devote their whole lives to the clar- ification of these natural phenomena and who are supported by the public purse to the end of their days, were themselves not aware of them. One- sided activity apparently produces me ntal sterility and thus the very expression, 'an opinion lacking any scien tific basis' provides grounds for gravest concern. It is really quite unnecessary to go right back to Noah, who became the first marine officer from sheer horror of water, in order to establish that there may be other sources of meaningf ul, economic and social facts, apart from qualified authorities. In many inst ances it can actually be an impedi- ment to be possessed of too much so-called knowledge. The Maid of Orleans succeeded in winning battles rega rdless of the entrenched theories of strategy and tactics. In the same way it should be possible, despite the resistance of feudal knowledge, to solv e the enormous natural, scientific and technical problem, which indubitabl y is waiting in the wings. All the elements were always there although much has been covered up, by people who believed they could step outside the natural order of things. The remarkable aspect of the course of my life is that it was the disputes themselves, indeed the positive attempts at my elimination, which always look matters a gigantic step forward. Therefore I will mention two conversa- tions that occurred at the time of my defensive battle. The first conversation was with the former Minister for Agriculture, Andreas Thaler, and the sec- ond with the now deceased Prime Minister, Dr Ignaz Seipel. When I was the duly appointed, albeit unenviable, water-wizard of the Federal Austrian Forestry Department , no week passed without an uproar in one province or another only later to subside in some minister's office. Thus one evening I was summoned to th e ministry in order to give an account about some incident or other. At the time, as far as I recall, it was about a general attack by all the forest administrators who demanded my most expeditious removal from government service. 42 Professor Werner Zimmermann, publisher and editor of the ecologically oriented magazine TAU, who published a number of articles by Viktor Schaube rger and was also Viktor's stalwart friend in adversity.- Ed."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Prime Minister, Dr Seip el, greeted me with the words, \"Tell me, what is actually the matter with you! Every week you are brought to my attention. What weighty matters did you discuss with my Minister of Agriculture today which made him send you over to me immediately?\" \"Prime Minister, perhaps yo u may still recall that without any action on my part, I was urged by Mr Loew, the head of department, and Mr Buchinger, the then Minister of Agriculture, to leave pr ivate employment and enter government service. The reason for the appointment was a l og-flume I built a few years ago which, against all expectations, achieved extrao rdinary savings in running costs. These savings were made possible only becaus e I had come to understand the true nature of water. In my view the current practi ces of modern water-resources management should be prohibited by law as quickly as possible. Not only will all the waterways be ruined, but agriculture as well, the groundwater table will sink and the time will soon come when the whole production of high-quality food in Central Europe will be jeopardised. \"The forest will also die if all clear-felling operations are not forbidden immedi- ately, for through the denudation of the forest floor, ecologically-essential differences in temperature will be lost, which enable vital calciferous substances 43 to enter the interior of the tree. What contemporary forestry regards as light-induced growth is in reality one of the symptoms of cancer-promoting disease, because the enlargement of capillaries disrupts the processes of diffusion necessary for the organic growth of the tree. Owing to the resulting increase in oxygen pressure, symptoms of inflam- mation must appear which in my view are precursors to the emergence of cancerous decay and the qualitative demise of the high forest. \"The present system of artificial fertil isation is extremely dangerous because the soil will be ruined and the infiltrating sl ag-residues will block up soil capillaries, resulting in the cessation of interactions between geosphere and cosmos. Terrestrial earth-rays are bound by these energetically -leached residues and only draw inflam- mation-enhancing calcific 44 substances from the soil, leaving inflammation-imped- ing calciferous substances behind to form hard-pans. Prime Minister! Earth, water and air ar e organisms with mutually contrasting potentials and are able to transform and bu ild each other up reci procally only as long as humanity does not disturb these natu rally-ordained reciprocities that have functioned for millions of years, reciproc ities which actually order life itself.\" \"Are you Catholic?\" Seipel then ask ed. \"Yes, Excellency, although I must men- tion that according to the information p assed down to me by my father, our family is still burdened by a 12th century papal excommunication.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Seipel. \"My ancestor, so the story goes, was a man of long-standing nobility who revolted against the temporal seat of the Archbishop of Passau. He was cap- tured and shortly thereafter his height was shortened by a head in accordance with 43 'Calciferous': Calcium-forming or -producing substances, especially calcium carbonate. - Ed. 44 'Calcific': Forming lime or chalk. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"the decrees of a papal bull.\" Seipel star ed at me for a long time and dismissed me with the request that I should spea k further with Minister Thaler. Thus I soon found myself once more in th e presence of t h i s illustrious peasant Minister, who amongst other things, related the following experience to me. \"In the vicinity of my farmhouse in Tyrol runs a spring, which I always observed with much anxiety during hot weather because this little spring was the be-all and end-all for myself and my farm. In this way, year after year, I was able to establish that this little spring discharged higher and higher up as everything around it began to dry up and turn brown. The hotte r it was, the colder the water became, and eventually during an extremely dr y summer it emerged about twenty paces higher up. The water became better and there was more of it. Water really harbours so many secrets\", stated the intelligent mi nister, \"and I fear that in many things you are perhaps quite right. However, po werful forces are arrayed against you because you hold completely differen t views and are not easily overcome.\" Many efforts by way of anonymous documents failed to compensate me for the unpleasantnesses I suffered. S hortly thereafter my employment as water-wizard came to an end. To some God gives in sleep, while others must learn with greater difficulty th rough the fickle fortunes of life The course of my later life took me to many nations and thus I came to the bar- ren mountains of Montenegro, a region of particular interest to a water researcher. One day my thirsty mount le d me to a remarkable spring at an altitude of about 1,200m. After a protracted time communicating in sign lan- guage, the accompanying Muslim explai ned that this spring constantly wandered. In hot weather it emerges high up on the mountain, and in the cold season it flows in the valley where, apart from other related phenome- na, its discharge diminishes. At the point of entry into the light, this spring was exactly +4°C (+39.2°F). About 15m downstream it was already about +8°C (+46.4°F). The most remarkable aspect of all was that at this lower point I could measure an almost threefold quantity of water, al though the channel fell almost vertical- ly and any possible inflow did not exis t. Any kind of braking of the water was also impossible because the water flowed over completely smooth rock. For the first time I was confronted with a practical example of water-growth and also with a wandering spring simila r to the one that Minister Thaler had described to me. Apart from the growth of the water itsel f and the striking increase in tem- perature, no other form of growth was evident at the higher position, whereas at the place where the spring flowed during the cooler times of year a burgeoning profusion of all manner of aquatic plants was to be found. If at the upper position water was drunk directly through the lips, then I experienced a conspicuously str ong dizziness, almost akin to an ine- briated state, whereas the water at the lower point, which I also repeatedly"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"visited at other times of year, produced no ill-effects. The fact that the spring stemmed from one and the same source w as proven by the drying up in the lower position at which, despite the lo wer external temperature, the spring was warmer than it was when it emerged higher up on very hot days. I was able to establish the reason fo r the peculiar behaviour of the water only years later. Air and water are th e products of inte rmediate spaces, space-lattices, 45 in which a large variety of diffusive functions take place, wherein the effects of heat or cold are significantly altered. The greater the resistance offered to the Sun's rays, th e finer the space-lattice mesh becomes and the colder the water and vice versa. If the pores in the stones lying on the bottom of the spring are closed as a result of cold influences exerted externally, then in spite of very low external temperatures the water will become warmer. Springs which exhibit te mperatures of about +4°C (39.2°F) during the hottest periods warm up to about +7°C to +8°C (+44.6°F - +46.4°F) at cold external temperatures of about -32°C (-25.6°F). Alpine huntsmen call these springs 'warm waters' and they set their fox-traps near them, because these springs never freeze; on the contrary, they become increasingly warmer the colder it is outside. For a long time I was unable to understa nd why the rock in the vicinity of the spring was so homogeneous, despite direct irradiation by the Sun. Eventually this mystery too was explained. In a certain sense, such rock not only grows with direct sunlight but it also contracts its pores mechanically, in order to protect itself from the effect of the Sun's rays 46 . The smaller the pores, the cooler the emerging water. Th is is because only the most ethereal, high-frequency rays 47 are able to penetrate the rock. It is this quantitatively- reduced but qualitatively-in creased solar pressure which cools the warmest water by many degrees within a few seconds. However, if the pores of a stone lying in a good spring contract, due to the physical influence of cold then, as mentioned earlier, the water wi ll become warmer since in this case only the most noble [refined] geospheric rays are able to emerge and com- bine with concentrated oxygenes 48 . All growth is founded on this wonderful Law of Reciprocity, 49 and thus we find that in contrast to shade-demanding species of timber, light-demanding timbers have a complete ly different bark structure. The latter rely on thick bark as a means of protection whereas the former pro- duce a dense crown-closure in order to flourish. It is therefore quite self- 45 'Space-lattice': An energetic atomic matr ix or structural configuration. - Ed 46 'Ethereal high-frequency rays': The higher the frequency of the radiation, the less its expansive, heating effect.

The skin-colour of different human r aces, and the various types of animal fur are also to be attributed to this phenomenon, which reflects the indirect processes of growth 50 . This alteration of the pore morphology gives rise to changes in general metabolic activity, wherein lie the origins of the scourge of the twentieth century - cancer. In orde r to make this terrible plague dis- appear again we must take heed of the intermediate processes of growth which are directly connected with th ese phenomena, wherein energies are diffused indirectly. For this reason the simplest remedy for cancer is water infused with the most highly refined ethericities of a geospheric nature. 51 Above all, this water possesses a remarkab le property. Shortly after drink- ing, it warms up, and about two hours later it generates a singular coolness in the body which no ticeably refreshes the whole or ganism. Apart from rais- ing sexual potency, it also has quite a re markable effect mentally, and there- fore after a longish period of consumption even thoughts that are able to penetrate these secrets are produced. In this way the veils concealing Nature's many secrets automatically begin to fall away. The Sun's rays, falling on surrounding protective rock, will homogenise its fabric through the deposition of tran sitional substances. The same sort of deposition occurs in the body when s un-drenched water is drunk constant- ly. Conversely, when we drink water that has been correctly constituted geospherically, or if we take in foodstu ffs that have evolved under this nat- ural inner protection, then dissolution of the transitional substances takes place. A phenomenon of particular not e is that under the influence of light, good springwater produces only bacteria es sential to life. High-quality fish are attracted to it in the spawning season in order to provide their young with the noblest of fare. These processes of ur-genesis are indire ctly connected with the rock formation surrounding the spring because the peak eff ects of the mutually opposed terres- trial and solar rays can only give birth to the most highly evolved entities. This explains why high-grade bact eria are present only in water in which inferior substances are incarcerated, as it were, in the surrounding material. This is con- stantly patrolled by policemen (free, di ssolved oxygenes) in order to prevent the emergence of the above lower-grade life-forms. Thus in all water or blood-supply vess els in which the c ontents are con- ducted in an organically-correct fash ion, we find that dangerous opposites 50 In the case of human skin colour, this relates to the different ways in which sunlight, for example, is diffused through the variously coloured pigments as a result of the differences in colour. - Ed. 51 'Geospheric': Belonging to the Geosphere and originating from within the Earth, be it of material or immaterial nature. - Ed "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"are separated from each other in one and the same profile. This enables interactions between individual peak -effects to take place incessantly. These are responsible for the grow th of water or the quantitative increase of blood, provided the necessary sterilising mech anisms are present and the external tissues are in a healthy condition. Nature does marvellous things when ever she decides to unveil her mysterious ways to humanity, the crown of creation. She directs and protects those who honour and faithfully serve her, and for this reason I have cast to the four winds even the most well-intentioned warnings of concerned friends. Life is a remarkable illusion. It is ever in the service of one form of metamorphosis or another, and therefore even a papal excom- munication can be transformed into a blessing if omniscient Nature so desires. Return to Culture Part of an article written in 1932, th e remainder unfortunately being lost. Our accustomed way of thinking, in many ways and perhaps without exception, is opposed to the true work ings of Nature. According to our way of thinking it is inexplicable why cold water is unable to accelerate when flowing down an unobstructed sloping c ourse into a valley. Science does indeed provide explanations for th is which, however, do not apply. Likewise, how is the warm, lighter water of the Gulf Stream able to displace cold, heavier, surrounding water, and in a broad, deep current travel across thousands of kilometres, even in a reverse (uphill) gradient? 52 Equally incomprehensible is why cold, heavy groundwater high up in the mountains does not sink downwards, and under certain circumstances it even rises. Or conversely, why is it cold in the stratosphere and why is warm, light air unable to rise upwar ds? Here the resistances against its rising appear to be significantly less than inside the Earth, where water, despite its own weight and at times with difficulty, can still wend its upward way. No-one who has ever seen a riverbed in the Sahara (a Qued), which in times of drought is a gigantic flat, yellow trough full of gravel, could imagine that in the event of a sudden rainstorm cold water cannot penetrate 52 'Gradient': In terms of Viktor Schauberger's concep ts, a gradient refers principally to temperature. Temperature is seen as a conditi on of energy, and with a decrease in temperature (positive tempera- ture gradient), water gains in density, dynamics, potential and energy content as it approaches a maximum at +4° Celsius, its so-called anomaly point. In the present instance the gradient can also be interpreted in a topographical sense, in that the seabed under the Gulf Stream slopes upwards from the Caribbean Deep to the Dogger Bank, so in a fash ion the Gulf Stream is actually flowing uphill. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"into the hot earth. This can happen with such severity that shepherds with their whole flocks, and troops of so ldiers, man and horse alike, can be drowned. More puzzling still is the phenomenon that when approaching the Sun it becomes colder, and conversely, that th e temperature rises with increasing distance from the Sun. If the Sun is at its zenith (perihelion), when we expe- rience its greatest heat, the explanation is again lacking as to why, when the Sun is furthest away (aphelion), the most intense radiant energy is encoun- tered. As it flows down a steep incline, even a cold, clear forest stream presents us with an apparently almost insolu ble enigma. The more precipitately it flows down a steep slope, the less it damages its bed and banks. If the same stream becomes exposed due to deforesta tion, and if its water is warmed by the direct light of the Sun, it becomes lighter and less dense. It then immedi- ately begins to destroy its ba nks and becomes a raging torrent. Mosses demonstrate a law to us, which is initially incomprehensible to our accustomed way of thinking. In th e cold, fast-flowing water the tips of mosses growing on the stream-bed an d on the slippery stones play a remarkable game amidst this rushing turmoil. Should the temperature of the water approach +4°C, when it becomes heavier and more solid, its flow taster and more torrential, then the tips of the moss point upstream. Curiously enough, if the water is warmer and therefore lighter, and its rela- tive forward motion is slowed down, then these same moss-tips point down- stream. However, not only do these moss-tips seem to defy known laws, but so does other life natural to this environment. The fish, the mountain trout which lives in such rushing forest str eams, reveals to us wonder upon won- der. The colder, heavier, swifter and clearer the water becomes, the more motionless the trout's stance and the faster it is able to flee upstream when danger threatens. If however water is exposed (through removal of the pro- tective tree-cover) and warmed up by the now unobstructed incident rays of the Sun, it becomes lighter, more tur bulent and its forward motion is imped- ed. Under such conditions it is impossible for the trout to maintain its sta- tion in the flowing water without physical effort. The trout is unable to maintain its former almost motionless, tranquil stance - its characteristic and natural right, but through activity b ecomes visible and sw iftly falls vic- tim to its enemies. The tr out now begins an ever harder struggle for its very existence. As the water warms its f ood is ejected from its formerly pre- scribed path where once, without any effort on the part of the trout, it was swept into its jaws. In exactly the same way that our thoughtless interference has made the trout's existence more precarious, our incorrect way of th inking has also"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"made the struggle for our own survival more difficult. Our thinking is inconsistent with what we actually see. The eye is a perfect, natural organ. The seen image is a reaction phenomenon. Using an artificial optical appa- ratus, the same effect can only be obtained in a roundabout way, by means of a negative. The eye, on the other ha nd, immediately presents us with the diapositive, which is the true image. Our sight constitutes an unconscious, automatic transformation process. Our thinking however is really a purely individual, conscious and, under certain circumstances therefore, a learnable process. If our thinking is to attain the same perfection as our seeing, then we must change our way of thinking and learn to see realit y not as an action, but as a reaction. Perfect thought lies in the apprehension of the correct reaction, for before the eye can show us the positive, it must first transform the negative. In effect it must break up what it records. What we see therefore, is the turning inside out of what we receiv e. What our mind grasps in this way must be re-formed and re-thought if we wish to attain that for which we strive. 53 There are many contradictions which appear to lie between our thinking, our action and what exists in reality. One, however, on closer examination threatens the whole edifice of scientific development. As we shall see later, this phenomenon is proof that even a stone should be viewed as an organic structure, a living system, and that what we call 'the Sun' is also the same as the Northern Lights. Both are phenomena arising from cold oxidation precipitat- ed by low temperatures, and have nothing in common with the concept of fire and of direct heat. Two completely identical pebbles or two identical, organically grown and flawlessly structured high-grade tim bers, when rubbed together under water, can produce a clearly perceptible fiery glow or ray of light. It is indeed curious as to how two complete ly identical objects can produce fire when rubbed together, and the question arises: what is actually burning! Why isn't this fire extinguished by the surrounding water? For on the contrary, the radiance actually intensifies when the water approaches its anomalistic temperature of +4°C. We cannot be concerned here with he at due to friction in the commonly accepted sense, since frictional heat cannot be created or maintained under 53 \"It has been proven psychologically that human bei ngs can only appreciate or apprise, i.e. com- prehend and understand, something new, if they can succeed in raising into their higher conscious- ness the subconscious immured in their brain cells.

And even the eye has first to learn how to see everything new; it too must therefore be aroused from its latency before it can grasp the seen.

We are therefore confronted with a phenomenon which is impossible to explain terms of current scientific theory. De facto, no branch of science, with its present makeshift concepts, is in a position to explain the cause of this effect. Not only this phenomenon but many other surprises arise out of a closer examination when viewed from our accustomed standpoint. These inevitably lead us closer to the rea lisation that our way of thinking, and thereby our way of acting, stand in opposition to the workings of Nature and are therefore against Nature. In fact, on closer inspection it can be shown that our increasingly wide- spread impoverishment is principally to be traced back to gross flaws in logic; to errors which in part had th eir beginnings thousands of years ago, and to which the wealth of whole nations have already fallen victim. Thus we increasingly come face to face with the conscious realisation that in many cases we have built on false th eorems and principles. Unfortunately, these false principles can neither be removed from the biological catalogue, nor from humanity's memory. Passed on as they are from generation to gen- eration, they always remain the basis fo r our economic legislation. Since it is tounded on false premises, it must inev itably lead to the economic decline of those nations deemed highly cultured by today's concepts. In the following, as a typical exampl e from school will demonstrate, one of the greatest errors in thinking whic h has, astonishingly enough, been able to persist for decades, leading a whole world astray. When the farmer clear- ly understands what water actually is a nd what role water and its habitat, the forest, play in the whole economy of life then the present activities of our forest and water industries would be forbidden by law. As our chemists tell us, water is H 2 O. The fact that water can be decom- posed into its component parts, H 2 and O, with the aid of an electric current has served as proof of this for decades. Practical experiment demonstrates, however, that distilled or chemically-pure water, pure H 2 O, cannot be decomposed by an electric current. That is unless acid has first been added to it, in order, it is said, to be able to conduct the current. After the electroly- sis 54 has been completed, what remains behind is once again water, H 2 O. If the experiment with electrolysis is to be repeated successfully, then acid must again be added to the water. This is a sure sign that acid is no longer present in the residual water, in other words, that it has been used up in the process. Should one of the products of decomp osition, so-called hydrogen, now be burnt (hot oxidation), then the obligatory residue, water, is again present, and in addition, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which is associated with all combus- tion processes. The remain ing water, or the hydrog en that was 'burnt' to 54 See Viktor Schauberger's ar ticle \"Electrolysis\" in The Fertile Earth, vol. 3 of the Ecotechnology series. — Ed."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"water, was therefore only the carrier of carbones (fig. 4), which were restruc- tured (gasified) by the electric current . Such carbones, for example, are pre- sent in household well-water, and in the case of distilled water are introduced into the water by the addition of acid. Fig. 4: Hydrogen, the carrier of oxygen and carbone. In practical terms, we are not concerne d here with the combustion of hydro- gen gas, but with the combustion of carbones present in the hydrogen (the carrier H), from which ultimately all acids are formed. These carbones com- bust with the aid of higher temperatures, or at appropriate low tempera- tures undergo a process of cold oxidation. The essential, crucial and previously unknown aspect of the matter, however, is that it does not involve any chemical bond between O a nd H. Instead, under certain move- ments of temperature (temperature gr adients) oxidation occurs between O and the carbones concealed in the carrier H, which leads to the carbones' remodelling, enhancement, or transformation. Quite apart from other natural conform ities with law associated with it, this process of qualitatively up-grad ing (ennobling) the carbone totally departs from accepted theory. It must ta ke place, however, for the very rea- son that the immediately-following oxidation always happens under a lower temperature than the preceding one. This occurs if the process is allowed to proceed in the proper way and is not de railed by the interference of people and other disturbances. If this oxidation takes place under the right temper- ature gradient, then apart from the reconstitution (qualitative ennoblement) of the carbones, there is a simultaneous charging of energetic potential, which increases the level of energy in the material itself. This leads to increased potential and tension in a nd between the new substances. The increased build-up in energetic charge and potential always occurs in pro- portion to the work done through the oxidation. The stronger and hence more naturalesque the oxidation, the higher is the quality of the product of this process, namely the substance. We are therefore confronted by the fact that up to now our view of energy and the way it is maintained is incorrect, and that as a result action and reac- tion do not represent a balanced system . The reaction is a multiple of the action, provided the preconditions for the reaction or oxidation take place according to law, i.e. if O and C are correctly distributed in the carrier H, and the oxidation can take place under the right temperature gradient. With this realisation alone all our economic concepts to date are truly turned"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"upside down, since our present economic thinking is ionised on 'taking' and pure mechanics (direct action). It is thus unsuitable for any practical economic activity. All the real phenomena of Nature, for example, the increased growth of vegetation, which is ultimately all we strive to emulate, ar e only reactions (indirect effects). The present economic situation is the logical result of this serious error in thinking. The apparently unavoidable economic decline, however, is only the thoroughly befitting consequence of a total failure to perceive the laws prevailing in Nature. It is a result of completely erroneous interpretations which, quite logically, lead to furthe r mistaken activities. These mistaken activities (our work) must legitimately lead to increasingly widespread unemployment, because our present methods of working have a purely mechanical basis. They are already destroying not only all of Nature's for- mative processes, but also the growth of vegetation itself, which is being damaged even as it grows. The logical outcome of the disturbance of Nature's most fundamental cre- ative processes can only be impoverish ment due to our meddling. This decline, the only tangible effect of our utterly misdirected work, however, is a necessary precursor for reconstruc tion. Without grinding poverty and a solemn warning sign we shall never come to our senses and learn to under- stand that Nature has no sense of hum our, when we clutch at her innards with greedy, clumsy hands. Nature, di sturbed in her development by our mindless endeavours, will only then relia bly and legitimately permit us a rehabilitation and reconstruction, the da y we break with the present system and its concepts. Instead, with our G od-given eyes, we need to base our future actions on more thoroughly considered notions which are seen to have their foundation in reality. The following practical examples will demonstrate that we shall have to accustom ourselves to fundamentally different attitudes. We will have to base our present way of looking at thin gs, our scientific and economic laws and as a priority our whole educati onal system, on completely different principles. This is imperative if we wish to halt the total economic collapse steadily gaining ground, and find our way back to culture. The sum of the various forms of mechanical and metaphysical 55 energy is not con- stant. If we view matter as concentrated energy 56 in accordance with Einstein, and make the logical assumpti on that matter will be of a higher order the more energy appears to be c oncentrated in it, then the purpose of 55 'Metaphysical': here the German word is psychisch, which can be interpreted as psychic, metaphysi- cal or of the nature of the mind.

All increase in the creation of ma tter is initiated by thermal motion. As is well known to us through scientific experiments, every process of trans- formation is associated with differences in pressure as a function of thermal motion in the carrier of the process. It is impossible for like to beget like. The above transformation can there- fore only be brought about through the in teraction of opposites. We are thus compelled to assume that this th ermal motion was itself the opposite of another motion, for otherwise neither motion nor transformation could occur. The picture of motion is some what relative, for it is immaterial whether the displacement of two points in relation to each other is due to a change in the position of ei ther one or the other (like the motion of the land- scape passing by the window of a travelling train). This thermal motion, however, requir es a carrier, which must be some- thing indivisible, i.e. an element (though not in a chemical sense). The causal agent of thermal motion can th us only be the product of other oppo- sites which are present in a common carrier - the element hydrogen, to which the general role of carrier of the process of transformation has already been attributed. Heat is not identical with energy, but only a manifestation of its function. Once again it is impossible for energy to arise from itself, from its like, for energy is the external result of the inne r potential or charge between mutually repellent elements of carbone and oxyge n particles in the common carrier hydrogen. Upon closer examination both these elements cannot in the long term remain hostile to each other, b ecause they seek to unite with each other in matter, and thereby to shape the matte r into a more highly developed form. This union once more generates a mutual impulse to separate, and through such separation arises the w ill to reunite (tension). This interplay of reciprocal separation and reunion now leads to th e increased accumulation of energy. Through this more highly organised ma tter develops, which represents a resultant energy incorporating a higher number of interacting oscillations. If in this way the will for reunion is proven through the fact of separation, then it is impossible for these opposites to effect a state of absolute inactivi- ty. However, they do provide our sense of perception with an apparent pic- ture of peace, in which their indi vidual phases are no longer visible to us due to the high rate of vibration or os cillation. (The number of cycles per second required to maintain a steady incandescent electric light amounts to roughly 50 hertz). Here we have the concept of higher development. If the purpose of the development of higher structures is not to be negated by the highest exponent of evolution, namely humanity itself, then it is impossible for Mayer's 'Law of the Conservation of Energy' to continue to exist in its present generally accepted form."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"In accordance with the way in wh ich physical processes are presently studied, only the process itself and i t s various stages are observed. It is assumed that the carrier of the proc ess remains unchanging, whereas in reality it also changes. This also relates to Mayer's principle of energy. Where only the conditions for equilibri um in mechanical forms of energy are considered, it is doubtlessly correct . Silence, however, is maintained about metaphysical forms of energy. If Mayer's Law of Energy proves the conservation of mechanical forms of energy, then when considering meta- physical energy the conclusion is reache d that there must be a further devel- opment, a continuously evolving growth that we can actually see in Nature. Therefore, if we include metaphysical forms of energy in our consideration of equilibrium, then we recognise that in this case action and reaction do not remain equal. Rather, that under certai n circumstances, the latter may be a multiple of the former, even though we have as yet no yardstick for the pos- sible comparison of both processes in terms of units of measurement. The collapse of our present world-vi ew permits the thought to surface that our whole way of working, even in its conceptual development, is incorrect. To influence the less highly organised natural pr ocesses in agricul- ture, forestry and water resources, the bases for increased growth, in the right way (and not to 'correct' them wilfu lly as we have done thus far), it is necessary to acquaint ourselves with the most fundament al mechanism for initiating activity. In other words, our thought processes and how they come into being. As we know from scientif ic research, every thought process is associated with differences in heat a nd blood pressure in the various parts of the body, as well as with other processes of which we are currently unaware. Through differences in temper ature and the differences in blood pressure thus created, the heart activat es the blood circulation and the deliv- ery of those formative substances re quired for the growth of the body. Naturally, it must also supply the br ain with nutrients, which are trans- formed there into higher grade pr oducts in order to produce thoughts. This transformation, however, can only occur when, after the accumula- tion of sufficient energy, the brain itself becomes an epicentre of energy. It is then able to transform energy from one form into another independently, in order ultimately to be able to emit it as a ray, radiance or information. This epicentre is then itself a source of energy in which oxidations can occur. A thought process, whose manner of coming into being has so far remained unknown to us, is the creation of a th inking apparatus that extracts its transformative substances from the blood circulated by the action of the heart. The process of thinking is thus a form of oxidation which, through the appropriate accumulation of a minu s charge (oxygen), permits the brain to become a secondary focus of energy that is in a position to transform energy into th oughts and to radiate them. Th is activity takes place in the"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"convolution of the brain, which have the structure of capillaries and thus act as resistances. The steeper and more tightly wound th e convolutions of the brain and the more numerous the capillaries, the gr eater the transformation of the nutri- tive substances and thus the higher th e quality of thought. The energies emitted from the brain in the form of radiation actually have no carrier; they are carrier-less. The proof that radiation is carrier-less is demonstrated by the way that radiation in a vacuum is not perceptible, whereas it is percepti- ble in a body due to the presence of the carrier H. Here the radiation experi- ences resistance and is transformed either into light or heat, in order finally to reproduce itself in wave form. These transformation processes create the structure of the brain. Similar transformation processes are also decisi ve in the creation of the remainder of the animate and inanimate world - for example, that of the tree and the stone, which for the following reaso ns primarily interest us here. 57 Agriculture and all the ot her politico-economic factors related to it, are dependent upon the correct growth of fo rest. In trees too, the higher the charging and radiation of matter, the smaller the capillaries in which the oxidation takes place. These important capillaries have been destroyed by humanity's interference through the li ght-induced stimulation of growth in shade-demanding timbers. This will inaugurate the decline of the forest industry, a decline that will be hallmarked by a degeneration in quality. 57 Since it relates to fo restry, the final section of \"Return to Culture\", entitled \"Forestry Agriculture     and     Wood Production\", has been included in The Fertile Earth, vol. 3 of the Ecotechnology series. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Genesis of Water The Genesis of Water From the Schauberger Archives - Viktor Schauberger, Linz, January 1952 In the French monastery of Arles-sur-Tech there stands in a cool crypt a great sarcophagus, made of the finest marble. For the last 700 years or so, there has been a fresh and powerful healing water in this sarcophagus, with which thousands of people with in curable diseases have been able to regain their health. It is a healing spring of a type similar to the world- famous healing source of Mary of L ourdes, which after much discussion and investigation was pronounced a w onder by the Church. The monks of this Pyrenean monastery offered a priz e of 1000 gold francs for the solution of this enigma, and were the mystery to remain unsolved, then without doubt, the water springing from this sarcophagus would receive a halo. Every high-quality spring that arises from the gigantic sarcophagus of the Earth is the greatest wonder; a wonder, how ever, which is known to dry up if the mouth of the spring is exposed to the direct light of the Sun. Under these cir- cumstances up-welling water becomes specifically lighter, and because of this it ought to spring much higher above th e ground were it dependent on pressure alone, which is the conventional scien tific explanation of this phenomenon. We, however, will attempt to unveil perhaps the most profound of Nature's secrets, the ur-gen esis of the Blood of the Earth. In so doing scientif- ic knowledge, which lies an octave too low, will be raised, thereby attaining a level on a par with that of the ur-ancient Religio, with the higher order of knowledge of earlier more highly-civil ised cultures.

Undoubtedly they also made use of them as the almost cost-free drive for powering specially construc ted machines. Ancient people were of such high spiritual standing that they also succeeded in overcoming physi- cal gravity with the aid of th e original motion of water.

This marvel, the true perpetual motion of Nature cannot be explained purely speculatively so here we must take examples from Nature. One of the most informative is the dewdrop, which is supposed to stand on the tips of grass. It also explains the apparent wonder in the Pyrenean cloister of Arles-sur- Tech and above and beyond this, the marv el of the creation of all that we see around us. The dewdrop is the physically first-born, which the indirect light of the Sun imbues with new life, and whose direct rays endow it with ur-form (prototype), with body and soul. T hus the foundation stone for develop- ment of new life is laid, without wh ich there would be no reproduction and propagation, no multiplying and ennoblin g of older forms of evolution. There would be no development on this terrestrial manure-heap Earth, in whose interior high-grade fermentati on processes take place, unless the owners of forest, farm, water and energy were as cautious as the doctor, who carefully ensures that no free oxygen enters the veins through his hypodermic needle. The reason for this precaution is best explained by the doctor, who has become wiser through unf ortunate experiences (as far as he is capable of doing so), for even the most naturally aware of doctors is unaware of how sap, juices an d blood are actually created. Early in the morning when the dawn begins to break, the atmosphere becomes noticeably chillier; the temperature approaches the anomaly point 58 of +4°C (+39°F). When the extern al temperature reaches this condi- tion of neutral stability and the state of indifference, there appears on the tips of the grass a very delicate protoplasm-like tensile form, which similar to a soap bubble or a small air-balloon, st ands motionless on each tip. When the rising Sun shines upon this primal, elemental and untra mmelled form, the protoplasm fills itself up to two-thirds with water. With, and because of, increasing heat from the Sun, the intensity of the light decreases 59 and the grass tips supporting the increasing weight of the dewdrop succumb to the law of gravity and bend down towards the ground. Finally the little womb- like sack bursts and the juvenile, ur-begotten water trickles into the Earth, accelerated by the blade of grass as it straightens up. 58 'Anomaly point': The behaviour of water differs from other liquids. While all liquids become con- sistently and steadily denser with cooling, water, alone reaches its densest state at a temperature of +4°C (+39.2°F). This is the so-called 'anomaly point'. This Viktor Schauberger termed its state of 'indifference', which in his view is decisive in terms of its potency and its influence on quality. It is also the temperature at which water has its greatest energy content, least spacial volume and is vir- tually incompressible. Above and below this temperature water expands, hence its anomalous nature vis-a-vis other liquids. - Ed. 59 Blue light is high-frequency, high intensity cold light, therefore greater warmth is manifested as light frequencies reduce towards infra-red. - Ed.

For once the water is born, the intensifying life-force in this minute sarcophagus is already committed to this physical first-birth; in other words, the new water-body has been unite d with its soul. This materialisa- tion only ensues when, in the anomaly state, the fertilisation of a negatively- charged concentration of dynagen by a bipolar counterpart can take place through a process of diffusion. Even then, it can only take place when the soil is metalliferous and trace elements with a specific charge or valency are able to play their part. These trace el ements serve as a spiritual-energetic connecting bond or a catalyst for the resu ltant emulsion (the intimate and intense union between bi polar counterparts). Were the catalyst - the copper pipe - in the sarcophagus at Arles-sur-Tech to be removed, then this would proba bly signal the end of all genesis of juvenile blood of the Earth within those marble walls. This pipe apparently displays no trace of oxidation whatsoev er, despite hundreds of years of stor- age, due to the absence of free oxygen in this hermetically-sealed container. The pipe would oxidise and the water would vanish, however, if the crypt was heated and if atmospheric oxygen, by this means becoming aggressive, was permitted to penetrate into the interior. Just how crucial is the anomaly state, not only for the crypt itself, but also for the interior of the coffin, is demonstrated by any wrought iron nail. For exam- ple, when embedded in a wooden sole-plate immersed within the anomaly zone of the groundwater, it exhibits no signs of decay (rust) whatsoever. Here too there is no release nor an increase in the aggressive behaviour of oxygen, which ur-generates either creative, uplifting energy or decomposive energy. In such a manner, even a grain of corn can maintain its fertility over thou- sands of years if it has lain in correctly and naturally acclimatised burial chambers or royal sepulchres in which it is protected from the influences of free oxygen. This protecti on is afforded by the artificially created anomaly zone present in these tombs or burial mounds, which have been constructed in a naturalesque way which inhibit putrefaction. This proves that those prominent in religion and society, who ar ranged to be buried in cool vaults within coffins made of certain alloys, were well aware of the difference between putrefaction and decomposition. The decomposition of the blood and bodily fluids takes place immedi ately when free atmospheric oxygen succeeds in entering a vein. It also ha ppens when latent oxygen in a sap- duct becomes aggressive through over-e xposure to light or overheating (in the case where shade-demanding timbers are planted out in the open) and binds the fructigens, which become passive under these temperature influ- ences. The origin of fruc tigens will be more pr ecisely explained later."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"We are therefore concerned with fundamentally different fermentation processes, which, con trolled by temperature, generate development-enhanc- ing or development-impeding forms of en ergy. The former lead to the pre- cipitation of amniotic fluid and subseq uently to im-plosion, which functions in a cell-building way. In the latter, the decomposition and decay of the physically first-born results. The conc erted effect of such decomposition leads to reflected radiation of emanat ory essences (horizontal ground rays), which, like an electric current, also decompose the surrounding groundwa- ter. This leads to oxyhydrogen gas-like ex-plosions, once the bipolar basic elements have been separated. More de tails about this will be given later. Incidentally, the levitational current, arising from the preceding im-plosion event, possesses contractive, biomagnetic forces. In exactly the same way as the Earth's magnetism, these act along th e longitudinal axis, and in natural- ly-flowing water, flow against the direction of the current towards the origin or source of the water. For example, an y trout standing in this high-grade concentration of dynagen is drawn along in their wake. By means of its adjustable gill system, this fish is in a position to manipulate this levitative force so that it either stands motio nless amidst the rushing springwater, accelerates upstream, or floats upwards in the middle of freely-falling watermasses. This happens if the falli ng watermasses, whos e flow is deter- mined by suction-curves developed prio r to the actual waterfall, can rotate around themselves, within themselves and about their own axes in cycloid- spiral curves. In the pro cess an ideal (subtle-spiritu al) axis can come into being, out of which, as occurs in our blood stream, the hitherto unre- searched emanatory essences 60 flow, which imbue the body with life. To the extent required for its freedom of m ovement, a trout makes use of these essences to overcome its body-weight effo rtlessly. This is conditional on its blood maintaining the requisite anomal y state, which is the condition of indifference (neutral potential) and t hus freedom from fever. In other words, the trout is healthy and thus capab le of reproduction and deployment. All formation of water, sap, juice and blood takes place by way of diffu- sion. This is the reason why a doctor is careful when giving an injection, so that under no circumstances may free atmospheric oxygen enter a vein. In such an event, conditioned by the bl ood temperature alone, decomposition of the blood can occur. With this the supposed wonder of the genesis of ur-water in the sarcophagus mentioned earlier now becomes understandable.

I ndeed they view such advanced thinkers as madmen. In actual fact the spiritual dimwits are the real 'lunatics', having created this fool's pa radise of ours in which we can just about manage to vegetate. In our degenerative way of working, we not only devalue our food but also saw off the ve ry branch of Life on which we sit. Of itself, this can overcome not only physical, but also spiritual gravity. After this digression, these suppose d wonders should be objectively and matter-of-factly described. Whereupon ev ery kind of hypocrisy will become superfluous, indeed ridiculous. A decade of observing the trout standing motionless in up-welling spring water has given me an insight into the deepest of Nature's secrets, so the theme of this apparent mastery of gravity should be more closely discussed. The first and most important condition for this phenomenon is that downward-flowing masses of springwa ter are able to in-wind themselves mechanically. At the same time, through a decrease in temperature towards +4°C (39°F), these watermasses are able to become specifically and physical- ly denser. For this a particular confi guration of curves is necessary. These we find especially well-por trayed in glacier moulins, 61 which even in the hardest rock are shaped by correctly adducting water 62 . In a similar fashion such water can also form blood and sa p vessels. If the surrounding rocks are alloyed with the appropriate minera ls, becoming metalliferous, then the first two preconditions have been satisf ied. The falling water can then con- volute in cycloid-spiral space-curves about itself, within itself and around its own ideal axis in opposite directions in the original manner of planetary motion. Thus a biomagnetic (contractiv e) dynagen concentration is created in the middle of the flow. In exactly the same way the metaphysical (physi- cally imperceptible) Tree of Life, w hose branches grow out into physical reality, comes into being along the biomagnetic axis of the Earth. Only by means of the interplay of mechanical and physical in-winding, which causes freely-falling water to approach the anomaly point, are bio- chemical products of reaction made po ssible. Viewed purely functionally, here we are referring to 'levitational' force, the opposite to that of physical 'gravitational' force'. Under naturalesque preconditions, these two forces are so balanced that gravitational force predominates. But only to the extent necessary for accelerated motion (speed of fall) of masses due to specific 61 Vertical shafts in a glaci er maintained by a constant descending stream of water and debris. - Ed. 62 The process of drawing or swirling inwa rd into the centra l axis of its own wake. - Ed. "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"densification (approaching the anomaly point). However, in the opposite direction, the intensity of levitational force thus triggered off increases to the extent required to maintain (at an al m o s t constant level) the steadiness in pace of free-falling watermasses or wate rmasses flowing do wn a variety of gradients. In other words, the specifically heavier the naturalesquely falling or flow- ing water, the greater the levitationa l counter-current. Through the interac- tion of counter-flowing emanatory essen ces, this counter-current projects itself upstream and manifests itself as new water. This explains why natura- lesquely falling or flowing watermasse s can grow or increase. At the same time the watermasses are also qualitatively improved due to a heightened generation of levitation energy. In all processes of growth, heat-substances (latent oxygen = solidified solar energy) are consumed, so the additional new water masses thus created are also caused to approach the anomaly point. This produces additional format ive and uplifting energies, which also undergo a quantitative and qualitative inte nsification. The intensification of these levitational energies in the l ongitudinal stream-axis becomes so pow- erful that the heaviest trout is sucked into their wake and is then drawn upwards. Due to this effect these fish , inwardly aroused, can climb at full speed on their nuptial path towards the source-spring every spawning sea- son. This explains the phenomenon of the stationary trout, which over- comes not only its own bodyweight, but al so simultaneously, the gravity of the water flowing against it. But we must return to the discussion of water itself in order to unveil the secret of what is actually to be unders tood by the expression 'binding the Sun's energies', through which the implosive force evolves. Implosive forces will make all present atomic energies (the lower grade explosive forces) completely uninteresting. The ove r-exploitation of coal, timber and oil will then cease automatically. In terms of the concept of 'energy', we need to understand the finely balanced self-equilibrating action of a bipolar dynagenic structure, which, depending on the imparted impulse, precipitates either fire or water. Since long-term economic growth, let alone a higher level of culture, can- not be achieved using the first ,of the two dynagen emulsions, explosion is excluded at the outset. In this case oxygen is consumed (burnt). Under the influence of heat oxygen is freed and becomes aggressive, whereas the fructigen of opposite polarity, a latent fatty substance, becomes passive (inac- tive) under the influence of higher temp eratures. This subject will be dis- cussed in more precise detail later. Here we are primarily concerned with the description of a higher-grade fermentation process, which becomes active when falling or flowing water be comes specifically denser during its descent, thereby accelerating and simu ltaneously approaching its anomaly state."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Water Mowing or falling in in-windi ng (involuting) cycloid-spiral space- curves never freezes. It bores almost s ilently into the p ool below and in order to wind itself upwards again, it ex tends its radius of action by rotating about itself, within itself and about its own axis. Viewed as a whole, an ur- works comes into being which, like a clock spring, is driven by an increase in weight (water-increase plus specific dens ation). The eternal state of rest- lessness, the panta rhei, is thus attained . It is the original transformation-serv- ing reproductive and propagative motion, the same type of motion of sap and blood, which is divorced from any pressure-gradient. In this system of circulation which takes place in cycloid-spiral space- curves, it is the tempo-curves, w hose shape induces frictionless motion, which are responsible for the constant acceleration of descending water. Again, by means of contradirectiona l brake-curves, the steadiness in the flow of such water is achieved, regardless of the geological gradient; its individual boundary velociti es can neither be exceeded nor decreased. The essential aspect of this original flowing motion is that, where the continuous- ly alternating temperature gradients in tersect, whose nature is determined by the type of motion, the development-enhancing energies are freed and the counterforce responsible for st eadiness of flow becomes active. In this way the standing or flowing blood of the Earth - water - becomes a sort of sarcophagus. Out of this a bi polar pattern of em anations streams forth in all directions (precisely dete rminable), penetrating everything in the surroundings. Through the influence of high-grade dynagens, it animates and energises the environs. At the sam e time however, retroactive, repulsive forces become free and active, eliminating everything capable of impeding or otherwise harming this process of further development. In naturally flowing, simultaneously increasing and qualitatively improv- ing water, regardless of external te mperature influences or changing condi- tions of gradient, implosive as well as explosive processes take place. These ran be so ordered that the formative and levitative products of reaction are principally employed in bringing the surroundings to life. This inner meta- bolic cycle is therefore the life-motor - a four-stroke motor in which actively impanding and expanding, repelling and thrusting motions rhythmically alternate. A pulse-beat arises here, which is not the ur-cause, but the outer effect of an inner reciprocating process. If one throws a piece of wood into a properly functioning ur-works (such the pool at the base of a waterfall), then one can clearly perceive cycloid-spi- ral space-curve water-mixing processes taking place. Here we are concerned with a peculiar swaying movement, an 'elfin dance', which proceeds in the same way as a dance in which bipolar sexes (man and woman) move around in an irregular circle, while si multaneously gyrating in waltz-like fashion about their common axis. This peculiar round dance is also perfored"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"by spawning trout coining up from below as the) prepare to float upwards w i t h i n the middle of the waterfall. In the same way that a human dancing, ample take the floor and seek the moving beat of the music, the trout also orientates and adjusts itself to the pulse-beat of the upward-circulating water in the pool. Suddenly it begins to sway in snake-like fashion at the edge of the pool and in-winds itself towards up-winding watermasses. It finally reaches the place where the waterfall flunges into the pool. It then dives in the direction of the axis of the falling water and begins its run-up for the intended ascent. In powerful looping movements it seeks and finds the source of the levitation force, which begins at the interface between the falling and upw elling water. It is now drawn into the vortex of the reactive up-current , which it assists through strong move- ment of the gills, like a pike before lunging like lightning at its prey. With good illumination, the path of the levitational currents is visible now and then. It appears as a tube, appare ntly empty of water, which we can perceive when falling water circulates with a gurgling sound above a drain, forming a downwardly-directed whirlpool which, with increasing suction, drags everything with it into the de pths. Were we now to imagine this whirlpool or water-cyclone operating in the opposite direction, then we have a picture of the reactive upsuctional effect. The phenomenon of the trout floating upward in the axis of fall, which has so far been a puzzle, has thus been solved. This floating upwards by the trout is connected with very particular dynamic processes in falling water. In just the same way the activation of a water-spout or a cyclone is also associated with very pronounced differ- ences in potential which can only occur in the tropics. If falling water cannot in-wind itself mechanically and physically, then the biochemical products of reactive substances cannot come into being either. The forces they produce possess a superordinate (metaphysical) upsuctional power, which in the above case draws the trout upward in its wake. The original cause of this cyclonic force is a high-grade fermentation process, which can occur only under quite specific types of water flow. These are types of flow which trigger im plosion, the binding of the stock of latent oxygen by naturalesquely-fer mented fatty substances (carbones). With regard to the term 'oxygen', it ha s to be understood here as solidified solar energy. It becomes so inactive at +4°C, the anomaly state of water, that in a mechanically atomised (dopey, drowsy) state it can be bound (con- sumed) by its counterpart, which in th e anomaly state has become free and monopolar. This reactive product of dyna gen has an implosive formative and levitative function. In this way it is possible to increase the ur-production, which will lead us out of the fool's paradise into which we came by way of unnatural methods of in creasing productivity."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Increase in Ur-Production Today there is constant talk of in creasing production and productivity. Productivity of this kind is achieved at the cost of ur-produced biomass. Th i s declines both in quality and quantity if the preconditions for Mr-pro- duction and growth are disturbed through destruction of the nutrient-pro- cessing zones of the soil and through unnatural and incorrect methods of water-retention and supply. Instead of procreative (high-grade) fermentation processes, warm interacti ons are triggered off. In an over-heated or over- illuminated cellar, for example, these give rise to fundamentally different products of fermentation compared to th ose that arise in a fresh (cool) cellar. In the latter a high-grade product is developed through the interaction of emanatory essences (reduction processes), as happens in the crypt of the monastery mentioned earlier. The anomal y zone, so crucial here, also occurs in watercourses whose motion is te chnically contrive d naturalesquely, regardless of constantly changing atmo spheric influences. This means that the anomaly state, so decisive for all growth and for the 'fever-free', healthy reproductive and propagative status of water, can be al most constantly maintained in winter and summer. To make this clearer, this will now be explained in more detail. When the upwelling watermasses in the waterfall pool overfl ow the crest of the con- taining sandbank, they again flow in a geological gradient and will continue to inwind if two space-curve flow- guides are placed immediately down- stream. These impart a naturalesque impulse to the current, the effect of which is maintained for at least 10km (6 miles). Despite these precautions, since the dr aining water is usually exposed to strong solar irradiation, it exhibits a noticeable reduction in the carrying capacity and tractive force. These are instilled into it in the vicinity of the spring and cannot be maintained unless 'cooling stones' are placed in it or are already present. When draining water collides with well-formed, metal- liferous riverbed stones, the laterally-deflected water-masses are imparted an additional rotation about their own axes. This again induces a cooling towards the anomaly point (+4°C/+39°F) , which is so important for growth and development. Measured at right angl es to the axis of flow, the reduction of temperature varies from 0.1°C - 0.4°C (0.18°F - 0.72°F). If it is taken into account that an expenditure of energy in the order of 42,700kgm is required to heat up one cubic metre of water by 0.1°C (0.18°F), then per stone, this represents an increase in bio-energe tic potential of about 85,000 kilo- gramme-metres (kgm). Therefore enormous constructive energies are lost if incorrectly regulated watercourses are warmed up to normal bathing tem- perature (about 20°C / 68°F)) in high summer, or freeze in winter. Due to the original flow-motion, which maintains the anomaly condition, both of these"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"conditions are impossible in naturales quely regulated waterways, despite the influence of high external temperatures. In those places where stones resist motion, the additional forces men- tioned earlier are freed and become ac tive. Moving three-dimensionally in the original way, the wate r also becomes denser. The suctional force centred in the axis is also intensified, produc ing an increase in tractive force and car- rying capacity by which sediment is transported and gradually rubbed together without heat. Bodies heavier than water are drawn into the loca- tions where suction vortices arise. Trout also stand here, for their food swims effortlessly into their jaws. Only on very sultry and thundery days does the latent oxygen beco me warm. The condition of flow also deterio- rates, resulting in a slight reduction in the tractive force and transportive capacity of the water thus expanded. In this instance trout are also forced to hunt for their irregularly distribute d food, now mostly stranded on the banks as flotsam and jetsam . Because of this the fish, as anglers say, 'begin to bite', for they are becoming hungry. Prof. Dr. Forchheimer's surprise was proof of the extent to which this is still unknown. Through his careful mea- surements of temperature, this world-famous hydrologist became con- vinced of the significance of the effect that resistances in the shape of well-formed and alloyed ston es have on flowing water. A temperature change of only 0.2°C (0. 36°F) in a fertilised chicken's egg is enough to inhibit the quickening of th e living embryo within, resulting in the generation of rotten gas. Similarly, a few tenths of a degree difference in the temperature of flowing water de termines its capacity for reproduction and improvement in quality. It also determines the possibility for the increase and ennoblement of the physi cally first-born - water. No wonder that, as a result of a complete disreg ard for original flow-motion, today's hydraulically regulated water decays and dies. Instead of non-pathogenic bacteria, pathogenic bacteria which are dangerous to health come to life. Naturally-flowing water is therefore a carrier of health, whereas when beginning to stagnate, it becomes the epicentre of an epidemic and a lethal danger to human and beast. It is also to be noted that temperature influ- ences arising from moving water are more powerful than those of the sur- rounding water and air temperatures. Wh ether an increase or decrease in temperature occurs in the course of fl ow, is therefore dependent solely upon the type of water motion. This determ ines which process of fermentation, warm or cold, will prevail, which in turn determines whether a formative or destructive dynagen-concentration is brought into being. The basic princi- ples and fundamental precepts to wh ich every water supplier should seri- ously pay heed, follow from this. Every form of water movement that tr iggers an increase in temperature (fever) in the accelerated watermass is just as developmentally dangerous as"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"a motion triggered by temperatures. It is immaterial whether the motion- inducing temperature influence lies above or below the anomaly point. Therefore only those types of water movement which accelerate water- masses artificially come into question. Wh ether this is in a river, turbine, pump or canal is unimportant. What is needed is water movement which approaches the condition of health (+4°C/+39°F), for only then is economic growth possible. The natural, legiti mate and progressive consequence of today's customary methods for mass -movement of water (conventional hydraulics), for tilling earth (by plough) , pumping water (by pressure tur- bine and pressure pump) or air-move ment (propeller and pressure screw), are pressure and heat-increasing proc esses of retrogressive development (cancer). This will debase all growth, ur-production, the more intensive and widespread the present me thods of working become. Temperature and the Movement of Water Every movement of water will trigger off reactions if it contains the bipolar (counter-potentiated) basic building bloc ks of life in a latent transitional state. An equivalence (transformation of motion into equal values of heat or vice versa) is therefore just as impossible as a constant maintenance of dyna- gen. Which type of dynagen concentr ation arises is dependent upon fer- mentation processes previously tri ggered by the gentlest of motive impulses. According to the type of fe rmentation, the dyna gen emits life-giv- ing or life-taking matrices of emanator y essences in the form of radiation. When, for example, a life-giving dynagen concentration produced by orig- inal mass-motion (where the temperature approaches +4°C, the anomaly state of health) emits ra diation, high-grade fermen tation processes are gen- erated in the surrounding body of groundwater affected by such radiation. Through these fermentation processes, higher-grade products of reactive substances are also created, simultaneous ly leading to the formation of juve- nile (new) water, in which the freed en ergies are accumulated and bound. In other words the dynagen concentrate, this higher-grade emanatory sub- stance transmitter, comes into being, which functions at a level one octave higher. This then gives rise to new chain-reactions in the surroundings, which have a life-giving function. If, by comparison, water is made to move hydraulically (pressure- increasing and heat-inducing), then precisely the reversed course of development occurs. For in this case water-decomposing radiation is emitted, which functions in exactly the same way as electricity when conducted through water. That is to say, a decay of basic substances takes place, whose synthesis results in de tonating-gas explos ion and a reactive"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"development of heat. This explains how a river or a current that descends at a rate of 800m 3 (28,250 cu ft ) of w a t e r per second can heat up to bathing temperature (about 20°C or 68°F) in high summer. In order to heat up one cubic metre of water by only 0.1°C, an input of energy in the order of about 42,700 kgm is required. If this amount of water is heated to bathing te mperature, it can only happen through the agency of the reactive development of heat men tioned above. In this way the higher- grade, superior-quality energies are lost, which serve to build up the vegetation. In the above case of 800m 3 of water per second (the average flow of the Danube or the Rhine), this signifies an energy loss of about 60,000,000 hp/sec or 45,000,000 kW/sec. Were water moved in the opposite way to that prescribed by today's authorities, all this lost energy could be harnessed towards building up the vegetation. This simple calculation shows just how far-reaching are the mistakes of such people as Robert Mayer. Mayer, ignorant of the reactive consequences of every type of water motion, postulated the concept of equivalence and the Law of the Conservation of Energy arising from it. The same is also true of Isaac Newton's Law of Gravity, 63 which failed to take into account the development of levitational power. Without this there could be no build-up of weight (no growth) and therefore no constantly increasing body-weight. The combined effect of these two laws would mean that there would be absolutely no motion, but rather an eternal developmental standstill and therefore no life on this terre strial dung-heap, Earth. The Earth's own original motion is triggered off by a higher-grade interac- tion between basic elements, which can only happen through the potential differences arising where light and heat are excluded. For this reason alone all over-illumination and over-heati ng triggers over-acidification, and through this the processes of decay and retrogressive development (cancer), all of which are the result of excess oxygen. This oxygen becomes all the more aggressive as the Earth's root zone (anomaly zone) is heated up through reversed reactive effects. An epicentre of epidemics is created, resulting in the impregnation of the Mr -production with the seeds of decay, which it then transfers to human and beast by way of polluted foodstuffs. Only a small mechanical, physical or psychic impulse or agitation is all that is required to trigger off the appalling scourge of this technical, hydraulic or dynamic age amongst flora and fauna. Present day researchers of cancer have also overlooked this communicative process. Consequently and in accordance with Nature's laws, more animals and human beings must prematurely decay alive, the greater the successes achieved by tech- 63 Viktor Schauberger commented wryly on the subject of Newton's discovery of the Law of Gravity: \"I think it would have been much better, had Newton contemplated how the apple got up there in the first place!\" (Implosion Magazine, No.35, p.16). — Ed."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"nology, hydraulics, dynamics and chem istry. These disciplines have jointly overlooked the degenerative and reactiv e consequences of all forms of accel- erated motion which deviate from the original form of motion in earth, air and water. But to return to the actual matter in hand; any water caused to move unnaturally or stimulated by temperature expands both in summer and winter. Only in very rare cases does it attain its anomaly and healthy state, where it is can reproduce and build its elf up (increase and improve itself qualitatively) and is once more able to release evolutive emanatory etherici- ties into the environment; so to breathe life into it and cause it to move in the original manner. Water forced into unnatural motion lose s its specific density and thus its carrying capacity and tractive force. It deposits its sediment in which are secreted latent stocks of raw materials and basic elements. Under natural conditions of flow these elements rub against one another without heat and by the indirect route of further fermentation and germination processes, they furnish the increasing watermasses with the nutrients contained in this water-sarcophagus. This cannot happen unless the anomaly state (+4°C to +9°C/+39°F to +48°F) of the water is maintained by the mechanical and physical in-winding motion of the dr aining water. Above and beyond this, and as a consequence of warm fermen tation processes, the build-up of a decomposing form of dynagen throughout the entire ur-production already begins. This manifests itself in erosion of the riverbank, pot-holes, one-sided deposition of sediment, silting up of the watercourse, flooding and droughts, in the degeneration and d eath of both water and more highly organised creatures; and lastly in th e emergence of pathogenic parasites. If the foundation stone of evolution de generates and dies, then through- out the whole course of development a process of regressive development (cancer) is set in motion. In forestry its beginnings are exhibited in 'light- induced growth', the coarsening of the molecular structure of the ur-pro- duction throughout the whole spectru m of growth. Therefore what the forest owner, that artificially-fertilis ing, clear-felling and excessive exploiter of forests, regards as a scientif ic achievement: supposedly accelerated growth, is none other than a rank prolif eration of cancer. The roots of this cancer lie in already-degenerated cell- space through which it receives con- tinuously-increasing and intensifying decomposive forces. Hence the incur- ability of cancer; small ur-causes, but gr eat effects. For all life arises out of the original motion of water, which is characterised by a decrease in temper- ature in the direction of the anomaly poi nt. In no single case has this so far been achieved with cont emporary methods of conduc ting water, whether in open spaces, artificial channels, pumps or turbines. Indeed, precisely the opposite has actually been achieved."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Flowing Biomagnetism In terms of this so far unknown concept, one has to imagine the exact opposite of so-called 'electricism'. Up to now it has not been recognised that electricity is the reactivated (and physically imperceptible) pressural force which arises out of over-illum inated and overheate d cell structures through the agency of warm fermentation processes. This pressure- imparting electrical force is the origin of the rank cancerous growth and coarsening of tissues mentioned above. The counter-concept of biomagnetism, representing cell-forming, fabric-conde nsing (contractive), for- mative and levitational forces, must also be more closely defined. At the same time the principal building block of Nature (the vital, finely dispersed residues of earthly fatty matter) will be examined. Its natural reaction-prod- uct demonstrates the essence of all gr owth and, coincidentally, the wrong track that modern science has so fa r trodden and which we have to thank for causing the constantly increa sing mass-misery throughout the whole civilised world. It was a forester, ambushed and kille d by poachers, who showed a living forester the way in which flowing ma gnetism could be generated mechani- cally. In the Frankfurter Illustrierter on the 6th of May 1951 (No 18) a short article appeared, stating that after four years the body of a forester, who had disappeared without trace, had been di scovered in a potato patch near the edge of a forest. An observant police officer had come across a place about 1 metre wide, where the potato plants were noticeably darker and their growth more luxuriant. Here they dug and found the body of the murdered forester in which the bullet, the cata lyst, was still embedded (viz. the copper pipe in the sarcophagus at the monast ery of Arles-sur-Tech). Many years ago in the region of Nuremberg, the grave of a murder victim was also dis- covered in whose pockets there were a few coins, and whose corpse was interred under a large and very leafy tree. Over thirty years ago I came across a flatfish mound in a virgin, alpine forest, upon whose rich greenness flower s of superb colours blossomed that strikingly did not belong to the surroundings. I once spent the night in this remote spot, in order to be close at da ybreak to a gamecock's courtship dis- play ground. Towards midnight, just where this curious mound was situat- ed, a bluish-white flame licked upwar ds. My first thought was that I had thrown an unextinguished match onto this moor-like spot and sprang up in order to put out the incipient forest fire. In the meantime the flame had grown a metre high and took on an egg-shaped form, similar to those that now and again issue from rock fis- sures and like shining dewdrops, sta nd on the point of a rock. Many years ago a chief forester from Vienna, Wa lter Hackel, photographed just such a"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"strange light over a metre high. A c opy of the photograph was unfortunate- ly lost at the end of the war, or rather was stolen by looters of my apart- ment. However, at that time I knew nothing of these things and so I backed away in horror, as I stood in this pitc h-black darkness before an ever more powerfully flaring and heat less flame, which threw a pale glimmer into the surroundings. At first, like a man possessed, with my heavy mountain staff, I hit at the place from where tongue after tongue of this mysterious egg- light sprang up. When I noticed that th is shaft of light only sprang from the rock at one point, I ceased to flail away at the supposed forest fire and loos- ened the surrounding soil. This, however, changed nothing. Then I held my hand in this egg-light and instead of feeling the anticipated heat, experi- enced an icy coldness and saw the bones standing out on my hand. An icy chill ran down my back. I returned to the tree where my gun lay, released the safety catch and sat down in my fo rmer bivouac and waited to see what else would happen. After about two hours the sky at last began to grey. A few hundred metres away the gamecock be gan his courtship, the actual rea- son for my early visit. I didn't m ove from my position, watching how this uncanny glow slowly extinguished, a nd suddenly the whole spectre was over. When at last daylight came, I return ed again to the source of the flame and on every tip of the lush green leav es I saw oversize dewdrops, again in egg-shaped form, standing motionless li ke glittering candle flames. As the first rays of the Sun pierced the tangle of leaves, the grass-tips bent under the weight of the ur-water, which visibl y grew as the Sun's heat increased. One by one, the now finished dewdrops fell down. Now I began to dig into the hillock with the tip of my mountain staff and underneath a peculiarly smelling layer of humus, I felt a resistance, which after further digging, turned out to be the almost undecomposed corpse of a chamois buck, which had a clearly di stinguishable bullet entry hole above the left foreleg. There was, however, no exit hole. According to the time of year, it could only have been shot by poachers, since the hunting season was long past. It was only later that it beca me clear to me that the buck must already have lain underneath this m ound for a longish period, because it was covered with a thick layer of humus upon which vegetation had doubt- less sprouted from time to time. On even closer inspection, I found a sort of mass-grave before me. The old hunters used to insist that chamois (as also happens with ele- phants) seek out special pl aces to die where slow decomposition rather than putrefaction takes place. Sick wild animals are attracted to such places which remain equally warm or cold in winter and in summer, seeking either a cure or a painless death.

This is why, as a particu- larly sly old forester explained, the high clergymen had themselves buried in a constantly cool church crypt, or why the more common priests at least had a little roof built over their graves along the cemetery wall at the east- ern side in order to protect them fro m rainwater. I realised later that, because of its free oxygen content, whic h activates decomposive forces, rain- water actually promotes decay or rusting. Eerie lights also dance over such gr aves from time to time and on nights of the full moon, upwelling skeins of mist are now and again visible. Only about 40 years ago in the Aigner Cemetery (Muhlviertel), this triggered sheer panic amongst the populace who sa w the dead priests doing an elfin round dance. These strange wafts of mist that occasionally ascend from close stands of mixed conifers at about 11 o'clock in the morning are known to every forester and are a reliable sign that there will be a heavy thunderstorm the same afternoon. Above the Nuremberg gravemounds on the eastern side of a thickly wooded slope, simila r phenomena are well known. At exca- vated grave-sites the bodies exhibit so -called 'soul-holes' above the chest. These are always missing, however, where the bodies have been burnt before burial, as indicated by smoke blackened stones surrounding the skeleton. A geologist and well known gravemound investigator by the name of Kerl explained that the latter cases related to those people whose physical and spiritual energies were consider ed undesirable for the afterworld and therefore received neither a soul-hole, no r a cool burial place. This geologist also contributed to the discovery of the above murder victim, because one night on his way home he saw a light eerily dancing over a cool shaded spot. In the Wiener Erzahler a longi sh article by the physicist Lormand appeared under the heading \"Mysterious lights demystified!\", in which he referred to the physicist Mestelle and his forer unner Dumas, whose experi- ments in part explained this phenomenon. \"At certain places on the moor stra nge lights (will-o'-the-wisps) suddenly began to dance, seriously alarming the people. Excavation demonstrated that in these places a wild animal had been slaughtered. Mestelle then had about 30 cow skulls systematically buried in which decay had al ready set in, for in his opinion the brain mass, which is especially rich in phos phorus, was the source of these uncanny lights. About 11 months later weird lights began to dance over these burial spots, convincing Mestelle that he had finally unveiled this mysterious spook. He let it be known that right up until the Last judgement , when their verdicts would be pro- nounced, the souls of the dead would rest in peace. 'Honest people would not be per- mitted to incandesce as they decay', hence we are here concerned merely with the self-ignition of decomposive gases.\""},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"That which burns, heats, and what he ats has its origin in annihilating fire, which arises through the agency of a warm ferm entation process. Genuine will-o'-the-wisps radiate no heat, but a conspicuous coolness. They only occur where the anomaly zo ne prevails beneath the surface of the ground. Proceeding with this line of t hought, and after many observations of naturally flowing rivers, I recognised the origin of the well-known gleaming of the so-called 'Nibelungen' or 'Rhinegold'. Only occur- ring in naturally flowing streams, this glow is emitted by mature limestones as they rub together in the coldest possible water. This ultimately led to the discovery of a mechanical wa y to generate upwardly-flowing bio- magnetism, or levitational force, along the longitudinal axis of a river, which effortlessly overcomes all we ight and manifest s itself outwardly as temperature-less light. Such light is also known to be generated by certain types of fish deep in the ocean, merely by moving their bodies in cycloid-spiral space-curves. This takes place in the negatively- charged abyssal anomaly zone, which fo r thousands of years has imparted the quickening impulse to the source of all life and the whole manifested world. And what does science have to say about future developments? In fifty years' time the atom bomb wi ll be uninteresting for the technolo- gist. The sources of coal and oil, which by then will also have been exhaust- ed, will likewise be totally uninteresting, for power and light will then be generated by solar energy. It will not be possible to do without fermentation processes altogether, however, even if they are used merely to improve the taste of alcoholic drinks! Without ferm entation processes there is no bipolar- ity, no potential difference, no motion and no life. Of course there would also be no water, no Blood of the Eart h, the ur-source of all we can see around us or otherwise perceive. Modern science seems to have misconstrued caus e and effect, otherwise scientists could neither speak of just one type of energy, nor could they exclusively consider it to be the only existing functional source of the bipo- lar concept of motion. Motion, howeve r, is an interplay between opposing bipolar elements, upon whose influence th e type of motion that comes into being depends. Every motion consists of components of kinetic energies. In scientific terminology these are called compressive and tensile components. It is the components of the pre-active and / or predominant motive force operat- ing in a given motion which determine whether life-giving or life-taking dynagenic effects result. These effects are always initiated by either warm or invigorating (revitalising) fermentation processes, since a dynagen concen- trate is only a limited conglomerate of raw material, whose effect can only be triggered by a motive impulse."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Gunpowder is another such amalgam of raw materials. Its explosive effect stems from its latent dynagen concentrates and is caused by some motive impulse. The same also applies In the case of very fine flour or coal dust, which due to the presence of at mospheric oxygen, explodes when it is stepped on with a metal-studdied shoe . For this reason, only felt slippers may be worn in gunpowder and explosiv e factories. Desp ite this, several powder factories have already blown up! This provokes the question: what theref ore is solar energy? It is doubtless only the heat generated when super-positively charged oxygen consumes (binds) its counterpart, the reflected ra diation of the terrestrial dynagen con- centrate. The counter-question arises: what happens when this emulsion, which arises from the intermixing of counter-polar emanatory essences, takes place in reversed order? What happe ns when naturalesquely-fermented carbone (mistakenly called hydrogen), which in the anomaly state becomes free and monopolar, binds (naturesquely consumes) the mechanically most finely dispersed, sluggish oxygen? The an swer to this is missing in modern scientific encyclopaed ias, because it is still un known that such a thing as a (predominantly) negatively-charged dynagen concentrate also exists. Here yawns a great gaping hole in our knowledge which first has to be closed through the study of natu ralesque processes before solar energy can be exploited on a large scale technically or more correctly , eco-technically. If bipolar emanations of dynagen ar e therefore intermixed under condi- tions hermetically sealed from extern al influences, then a predominantly implosive effect results, as occurs for example in sap and blood vessels. However, the explosive effect is also present as it has a role to play in the necessary excretion of faec al matter. Exactly the oppos ite occurs in the case of a purely technical, hydraulic or ch emical generation of motive power. Here, without exception, the reactive oxidising effect is always uppermost, which is dangerous for all forms of evol ution. Conforming to natural law, a retrogressive development is thus inaugurated due to the lack of counteract- ing reductive effects, the result of which is cancer. If the wonder of the Pyrenean mona stery mentioned earlier cannot be explained, then it is simply because the origins of the build-up of higher- grade juices and of the formation of bl ood, have so far not been recognised. Today it is still believed that the hear t is a hydraulic pressure pump driven by muscular contractions. Every body of whatever kind, whether mineral, metal, plant, animal or human being, is none other than a sort of sarcopha- gus, a diffuse resistance, required for the intermixing of emanatory essences. If one lays a stone or a board on th e ground, moisture develops under- neath it. When this resistance is co rrectly diminished, then between earth and stone or board a negatively charged anomaly condition is created,"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"which even denies atmospherically-influenced rainwater access to the Holy of Holies (the anomaly sone). It th e weather becomes sultry and excessive heat is exerted on the snow well developed anomaly zone under the hot stone, then earthworms be gin to migrate by the thousand. As do these earthworms, the stationary trout in rivers also perish, because the precondi- tions for the existence of these noble fish can only be found in a well-devel- oped anomaly zone. A general rise in sea temperature is also responsible for the migration to cooler zones of some sea-fish; a fact already recognised by science. Were the crypt in the monastery at Arles-sur-Tech to be heated, or the interior of the sarcophagus altered through the influence of atmospheric light or heat, then the marvel of the growth of water would cease. Indeed all that would perhaps be required to end it would be to allo w free atmospher- ic oxygen constant and unimpeded access to the interior of the sarcophagus, or to remove the copper pipe, which would very soon show signs of oxida- tion. Today's technology, hydraulics and dynamics utilise degenerative forms of light and heat in mass-produce d, unnaturally shaped and alloyed mechanical monsters, which necessitate the combustion of stocks of raw materials (crucial for natural processes of evolutionary development). Moreover, the resistances associated with these processes also have to be overcome; resistances that increase by th e square of the increase in velocity. As a result one must ask in all seri ousness whether one is not here con- cerned with exceptional fools. If in contrast, one considers the al most silent operation of implosion machines, which transform existing resistances into additional power, then one understands how a multiplicity of reactivated matter can be transformed into a higher quality life -form by means of additional reactive forces. These reactive forces are available in almost unlimited quantity, due to higher-grade fermentation pro cesses produced by the naturally- fermented fatty residues of deceased life-forms in the anomaly zone. This also explains how, from the minutest seed, a gigantic tree can arise, which itself creates a thousand million seeds. A properly planted potato can pro- duce up to 20kg (441bs) of high-quality potatoes within half a year if one merely remembers to incorporate the type of negatively-charged catalyst required for every process of transfor mation. In other words, the catalyst must be present that produces an em ulsion made up of combinations of emanatory essences of c ontrasting nature, through which water is precipi- tated. Thanks to the discovery of the implosion process, such water can be ur-created mechanically in any amount and of the best quality almost cost- free.

Handed down to us from antiquity, they preach that a healthy and happy existence is dependent on the na turalesque inter- mixture of the stuff of Heaven and Earth. The progeny of this marriage between exalted atmospheric and geospher ic ethericities is water, the blood of the Earth. This ur-source of life comes into being when the ethericities of the Earth bind those of Heaven. For this the maternal forces and energies must be more powerful than the incident fertilising substances, for if the process takes place in reverse order, then fire is created. The art of increasing and qualitativel y improving water has been so thor- oughly lost over the millennia that toda y no one knows what water actually is. How it comes into being, how it dete riorates or how it dies and subsides is still a mystery. If the degeneration and disappearance of water cannot be successfully halted, the Earth will turn into a treeless desert. The whole of civilisation is threatened! The survival or disappearance of humanity is thus at stake. We are concerned here with neither politics, nor racism, nor an invention in the usual sense of the word, but with the question: what is more important for evolution and development, wa ter or fire? This is what it is all about, and nothing else! Everything else must retreat far into the back- ground. Without water there is no habitat and no life! Most people know that machines are indirectly driven by fire. Entirely unknown, however, is that energy can be achieved far more simply and cheaply through the artificial production of water. Furthermore, growth can be promot- ed, increased and ennobled in the process. Therefore not only will the problem of an independent existence be solved, but in the future there will be no short- age of raw materials provided the mixt ure of heavenly and earthly essences can be naturalesquely fostered. This involves the industrial duplication of 'photo- synthesis', which is conditional on the possibility of energising the hydrocar- bones. With this discovery (which the Un iversity of California has so far sought in vain) all armed conflict will be unnece ssary. In future no sane individual will allow himself to be drawn into a war merely to satisfy power-mongers. All robbery will likewise cease once everyt hing is available in superabun- dance, for with the artificial production of water, vast tracts of desert can be restored to their former fertility and to provode living space for the ever- increasing mass of humanity. There will also no longer be the need to exploit this ancient art for purposes of war. Whether the disturbance of the water-balance happened out of ignoran ce or to maintain the economic status quo, through the iniquitous world-wide traffic in foodstuffs and raw materi- als, cannot be addressed here."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The fact is that, as today's technolog y has progressed, the point has been reached when the proliferation of can cer is not only universal, but appar- ent l y unstoppable. Fo r this reason the only solution is to put an end to the self-deception by reintroducing practice s that promote the natural treatment and care of water. All th is has nothing to do with science for it involves the diametric reversal of th e methods applied by today' s fire-spitting technolo- gy, a technology that should be consider ed the true causative agent of can- cer. Perhaps it is necessary for the miser y and privation of humanity to become so intense, before it is finally recognised that science, as the guiding force of humanity, has made a disastro us blunder by implementing reversed energetic interactions between basic elements. In consequence, any possibil- ity of resuscitating Nature's principal formative substance, reduced protein, was brought to a halt. It was thus inevitable that the processes of decay would become so rife in both air and water. This exemplifies the disastrous errors in motion and excitation made by a science founded on unnatural prin- ciples. The Nobel prize winner, Otto Warburg, proposed in a scientific journal that the formation of cancer cells w as caused by a deficiency of oxygen. A healthy cell is supplied with oxygen by the blood and uses it to process nutrients, thereby acquiring life-energy. However, Warburg has now assert- ed that the cell receives too little ox ygen. As a result the metabolism is reversed and the lactic acid become s thoroughly fermented, the cell grows and divides more rapidly and in the proc ess turns into a cancer cell. This is also confirmed by Profes sor Domagk. Both researchers, however, made a crucial mistake. They failed to see that it makes a considerable difference whether modified or unmodified oxygen enters the blood. Modified oxygen is formed when it is filtered by the lu ngs. Only then can it be taken up by fructigenic ethericities via the bloodstr eam, which on their part have been purified by the filters of the intestines. If this process of purification is in any way disturbed, then an oxygen deficiency results, leading to suffocati on and putrefaction of the unfertilised ethericities of protein. This is the answ er to the riddle. This is where a yawn- ing gap in scientific knowledge lies and without its closure cancer cannot be cured. Nature precludes the use of one and the same form of energy for dif- ferent purposes. Hence the report continues: \"Those a fflicted by cancer and whose lives are threatened by this terrible disease will read of Warburg's findings with resignation. Moreover, they will demand to know why this oxygen deficiency has not been pre- vented. According to Warburg, in this way the incidence of cancer could be reduced to a fraction of its present state if the cells of the body could be protected from chron- ic damage. How this was supposed to ha ppen, however, he was unable to say.\""},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Dr Liebmann, director of the Biological Research Institute in Munich, held that t h i s involved the disturbance of thi biological equilibrium. He over- looked the fact, however, that a stat e of equilibrium would necessarily imply a developmental standstill. In reality, it is a question of the disturbance of animating rhythm. There is no such thing as a rigid conformity with nat- ural law, but only a constantly self-c hanging interaction triggered off by constant fluctuations in temperature. If these are regulated so as to ensure that a predominance of recreative (ref reshing) influences of temperature is maintained, then the enormous proble m of more and more people and less and less food will also be solved. There are two fundamentally different types of motion, both in principle and nature, which respectively initiate different kinds of excitation in bipo- lar mixtures of basic elements. In this connection, water, th e physically first- born and the very blood of the Earth, plays the role of the mediator in both natural and unnatural energetic syntheses. At the same time it is also the recorder of the changes in potential that have already occurred. From this it can be determined what form of energy prevails in this natural accumulator. The decisive factor here is that cont emporary technology is only aware of and only uses those methods of conveying or moving various media which initiate a reactive in crease in pressure and heat . These methods will here be termed 'techno-academic', 64 because they are ta ught in all academies, universities, high schools a nd technical colleges. Albert Einstein used them to create a form of energy destructiv e of all Creation. With this, modern technology has achieved the peak of pe rformance in self-annihilation and turned itself into an absurdity. From transmissions from ancient times, it is quite clear that those peoples of Indo-Germanic origin or Aryan cu lture favoured a different form of mass-motion. They overstimulated it, however, and disturbed the unstable state of equilibrium in the other direction. This resu lted in whole sections of the Earth being torn upwards (the cataclysm of Atlantis). They strayed from the golden middle way. Existence or non-existence is dependent on the rhythmical dynamics of bipolar forces. We can see this in the alternation of night and day which serves the consta nt improvement and perfection of the processes of reproduction and higher evolution. Formative forms of motion are hallmarked by the development of an atomic negative pressure. Professor Ernst Ferdinand Sauerbruch, a surgeon, discovered it in 1908. He realised th at without the existence of negative pressure between the lung-surfaces and the pleura, any inhalation and exhalation of diffuse (purified and ex alted) precipitates of solar energy (chemically termed oxygen) would be impossible. In other words, there 64 The ancient Greek word Technao means remote from life, unreal, therefore unnatural and contrary to Nature. - VS."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"would be no re-spire-ation (fertilising) of digested, nutritive ethericities, which in exalted form en t e r the hermetic ally sealed blood or sap by way of diffusion. Unfortunately Professor Sauerbruch failed to see that this force, which internally bonds (emulsifies) the ethericities of fructigenic and semi- nal matter, is the diamagnetism discovered by Michael Faraday in 1845. Diamagnetism is also known as heal ing magnetism, animal magnetism or mesmerism — an ism that science views w ith disfavour. It manifests itself in a similar fashion to the pressural atomic forces that move a dowsing rod. Like the previously mentioned magnetism, this latter force can neither be mea- sured nor weighed exactly and is hence rejected by science. 65 There are some forms of energy that are known to alter the values indicat- ed by measuring instruments and on occasion actually to contradict them. Thus it would appear, for example, that the speed of light is constant and therefore invariable. The same also holds true for the so-called acceleration of free fall, because there is no m easuring device that can differentiate between specific and absolute weight. In terms of physical mass, the former is to be construed as breathing (animated) , whereas the latter is to be under- stood as less-breathing, the almost-lifeless. Before Galileo arrived on the scene with his discoveries, the theories of Aristotle held sway and it was believed that providing there were no disturbing influences, heavier bodies fell fa ster than lighter ones. That this was actually related to the different fa ll-velocities of bodies having either specific or absolute weights was completely disregarded. These constantly vary according to the state of their intrinsic qualities. If sufficient qualigen is concentrated in water, for example, then gravity can be partially overcome. Speculative thinkers will be unable to understand this, however, unless they observe Nature's instructive examples very closely. It must be stated at the outset that in this case the decisive but previously overlooked concentration of qualigen is only possible with the aid of radial->axial motion. Every medium becomes heavier if it is unable to breathe and its life is removed. This occurs immediately if excessive influ- ences of heat and pressure are brought to bear by the opposite form of motion. In this case the diamagnetic, or adsuctional and insuctional force (namely Professor Warburg's life-energy ) and otherwise known as levitation- al force by people of ancient cultures, is lost. 65 In his book, The Pattern of the Past (1969), Guy Underwood writes that: \"Observation of the influence which affects the water diviner suggests that a principle of Nature exists which is unknown to, or unidentified by science. Its main characteristics are that it appears to be generated within the Earth, and to cause wave- motion perpendicular to the Earth's surface; that it has gr eat penetrative power; that it affects the nerve cells of animals; that it forms spiral patterns; and that it is controlled by mathematical laws involving principally the numbers 3 and 7. Until it can be otherwise identified, I shall refer to it as the Earth Force. It could be an unknown principle, but it seems more lik ely that it is an unrecogni sed effect of some already-established force, such as magnetism or gravity.\" — Ed."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"If the importance of this formative, sy nthesising and levi tating force, pro- duced by centripetal motion only, had been recognised for what it is, then the tragic error made by Newton and Leibni tz would have been avoided. They believed that life could be comprehended with great precision through the met- hodology of mathematics (integral and differe ntial calculus). It is this erroneous reasoning that the whole world has to thank for the evil that Albert Einstein foisted upon us through the exploitation of an all-destroying atomic energy. A simple experiment demonstrates that a predominantly axially->radially moved (and therefore de-animated) water begins to breathe again and to rise upwards autonomously, when under certai n preconditions it is simply made to move planetarily. All forms of growth and more highly-evolved forms of life draw in diffuse (purified and exalted) oxygen. Where unpurified oxygen is impressed from without, disorder a nd cancer come into being, because cancer is an entity that has been expelled from a state of order. If pure, nitrogen-free oxygen is forced into the lungs of a child over too long a period, then it goes blind. Adults are threatened with an incurable lung inflammation. At hi gh altitudes the more th oroughly the Sun in-presses the body with unpurified energies, the sooner blood and sap begin to decompose. The same also applies in forestry, when for the sake of greater quantity and rapidity of rotation, shade-demanding trees, which have far too thin a protective bark, are exposed to direct sunlight, producing unhealthy, 'light-induced' growth. This also happens if forests are excessive- ly thinned. However, if a forest floor th at has lain for cent uries in protective shade, is warmed above +9°C by exces sive clear-felling and thinning, then reafforestation is only possible with deep-rooted, light-demanding species. Such reafforestation is fraught with enormous problems. The young plants have first to grow with difficulty unde r the scalding light of the Sun until they are large enough to provide the ground with new protective shade. Wholesale karst development (erosion) can only be prevented where the slope is not too steep and the pressure of solar radiation is not excessive. 66 Almost all monocultivated, plantation forests originate from this igno- rance. They can therefore quite prope rly be described as cancer-prone. They lack diamagnetic, adsuctional and in suctional force and can no longer pro- duce fertile seeds. As is the case with the remaining, over-cleared, old- growth forests, they too can be consid ered lost if the present methods of forestry are not drastically and quickly altered. Today's fertile soils and whatever water still rema ins are already over-acidifi ed and polluted to such a degree that there can be no recove ry without radical remedial measures. In Nature everything is reversible. Th e last hope for restoring the natural order of things lies in the mechanical production of diamagnetism which 66 While not encompassing the full import of the use of the word 'pressure' here, the physical pres- sure of sunlight = 4kg/km 2 (22.8 lbs/sq mile) = 0.004g/m 2 . - Ed."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"comes about in the opposite way to the present generation of electricity. The idea of generating life-giving energy mechanically and restoring water's life-force and ability to breathe may so und fantastic. Yet, the behaviour of water itself shows us how this comes a bout, as it sinks lifelessly back into the womb of the Earth only to rise upwards again as nobl e water in moun- tain springs. The reason why it has b een impossible to copy this natural process so far is simply because the enabling form of motion was unknown. People mistakenly belie ve the Earth's rotation to be circular. W ith circular motion, however, no negative pressure or drop in temperature can be achieved. Since the present way of looking at th ings is founded on a false world- view, humanity has set foot on the road of an unstoppable, regressive prolif- eration of cancer. As long as the mediative substances of water and air continue to be moved incorrectly with the exclusive use of centrifugence, any production of qualigen or in crease and improvement of water and growth will be impossible. Qualigen can only be produced with cold systems of flow, in which the more thoroughly atomised the substances (sediments) contained in the water become, the more powerful the life-energies. Here it should again be stressed that if the media of earth, air and water are moved centrifugally, th en reactive, decentrating forces evolve from the resultant unnatural intermixture of bi polar concentrates. These also develop if any medium is over-illuminated and/or overwarmed by unpurified (unfiltered) solar radiation. It can theref ore be stated that in this case the pressure and heat associated with it increase by the square of the speed of motion. In both cases, however, the resist ance to motion also increases — that is, a retroactive force evolves which, viewed ecologically, represents a decomposive energy or its other form, cancer. In this instance matter is ren- dered lifeless. Oxidising processes fo llow, and since the levitative forces have been reduced, matter becomes specifically heavier. Red-hot iron, for example, is heavier than cold iron. Ei nstein was right in his deduction that mass - the concentrate of basic elements - was dependent on velocity. However, it is the type of motion th at determines whether decentrating or concentrating forces arise. In the firs t case pressure and heat are produced and in the second, a negative pressu re (vacuum), which intensifies by the square of the centripetally-in-winding orbital velocity. In this way it is therefore possible to transform ordinary air at room- temperature into chemica lly pure water in a fraction of a second. This is associated with a 1,700-fold 67 decrease in volume, through which an atomic negative pressure evolves, whos e attractive force is stronger than 67 Water = 1 g/cm 3 . Air = 0.001226g/cm 3 .

Such wa ter can then be converted into the noblest mountain springwater, provided it is moved planetarily for a short period, as happens in the womb of Mother Earth. The technologist of today has been taught how to think logically, but not bio- ecologically. Therefore it is particularly difficult for him to appreciate the possi- bilities that ecotechnology offers toward s the re-establishment of the proper and natural order of things, which has been disturbed at its most fundamental level. The time has come to free humanit y from its dependence on coal and oil by creating those differen ces in potential that can be converted in to kinetic energy. Since coal and oil will be exhausted in the foreseeable future, nuclear fission will be all that remains to banish the spectre of energy-shortages. This is the greatest delusion of all, however, because the radiation and waste accruing from atomic energy will gradually contaminate the air we breathe to such an extent that the mere inhaling of it will be lethal. Humanity therefore stands at an historical crossroad - but in all pr obability it will continue to develop its present technology and dig its own grave. Then one day, thousands of years hence, the perhaps few remaining survivor s will speak of the technical stupidity of their forebears and shake their heads over the artefacts of a godforsaken sci- ence in whose programme destruction took first place. Science can still be dethroned, however, through the reversal of present principles. Instead of air pollution, eco technical air purification. Instead of the collapse of quality, the rise of quality.

Water can only be rendered gas-free through electrolysis, which decom- poses it into hydrogen and oxygen. If a catalyst is introduced, then all that is left is heavy water. On closer exam ination this discovery, which created a sensation a few years ago, proved to be developmentally harmful, and is therefore worthless cult urally and economically. Expensive experiments with oxyhydrogen gas to assess its suitability as a fuel were equally unproductive. The only remaining option, therefore, is the primitive, but expensive generation of steam, which nevertheless is a reli- able source of power. It is known that atmospheric pressure plays a role in the generation of steam. The less the pressure, the more quickly the water boils. Excessive extraction of positively charged air pressure causes water to freeze. Even these two findings produced no useful effect of any kind. In the first instance the potential force was lacking. In the second, the production of ice was too complicated and too expensive. Even in the raising of water there has been no major advance, apart from purely mechanical improvements to old systems of pumping. The water rais ed by suction or pressure was none the better for it. On the contrary, it became worse and worse. It was full of gas and stale. This process is also expensive and unprofitable. The same applies to contemporary rive r regulation, to the raising and lowering of the water table and to the installation of turbines for generating electricity. The water cons tantly deteriorates. Ignor ing this evidence, all attempts to provide suitable water for agricultural purposes failed. Compared to all other systems of ag ricultural fertilisation, the age-old methods of irrigating the land still prov e to be the best. However, this is only true to the extent that good water is still available. Today an untouched natural forest is the only supplier of good water. Its quality declines very rapidly, however, if the forest is turned into a monocultural plantation. This calamity was further aggravated when, for purely technical reasons, clear- felling and over-thinning operations became the preferred practice. The dry- ing up of springs and the sinking of the groundwater table were the solid results. Higher-quality timbers di sappeared. Mountains streams went beserk. Rivers became silted up thr ough the excessive deposition of sedi- ment, and further sinking of the groundwater table followed. Science failed totally wherever and however it laid hands on the ur- source of evolution and whatever evolve d from this carrier and mediator of life. Under such circumstances it is no wonder that water was described as an enigma whose solution lay as far away as the stars, and thus a riddle no human brain could ever fathom.

All they ever do is stabilise the riverbanks first in one way and then another. They take no account of the water itself, which obeys the same laws as the blood in our arteries and the sap in plants. The asse rtion that water should be viewed as the blood of the Earth and the soil that feeds us is completely justified. At all events it is a curious fact that those most sensitive to criticism are those most in need of in struction. No other profes sion has failed as miser- ably as that of the regulators of water and water-resources management. Those who cannot stand criti cism already feel guilty .

Unfit for truly public -spirited activities, they are anti-social parasites who should be removed from their positions, and the sooner the better! The Shattering of Quality The generation of steam is contrary to Nature. It is unnatural and therefore wrong. In Nature water is not vaporis ed, but evaporated. Evaporation should be viewed as a natural process of gr owth and transformation, of reproduc- tion and higher evolution, and of incr easing and raising water quality. The frequency of atmospheric water is higher than that of groundwater. Groundwater first has to be suitably swirled around in order to build up its inner potential energy. This can also be interpreted as the frequency of water. It is Mother-Water's creativ e capacity that gives birth to the Earth. Rain or precipitation is merely the product of a reduction in potential. It is not a product of condensation. It is a manifestation resulting from a concentration of up-flowing energies, which subse quently are downgrad ed into matter through the influences of heat and light . The cooling of the atmosphere after a fall of rain is therefore the result of a reduction in potential or a loss of internal frequency. Naturalesque evaporation is the prerequisite for the ege- nesis or upward outbirth of the parent-energies of water. Whatever falls earthwards as rain has failed to achieve its full evolutionary potential. It must return to Mother-Earth to be swirled by her again cycloidal- ly, and thus infused with new levitational energies, before it is able to repeat its earlier attempt to rise. If it succeeds at the second or third attempt, then it is not water that comes into being.

The so- called 'climate' is nothing more than the retroactive effect or the inversi on of a cultivable evolutive power, which has its beginnings in the Earth. The sa me applies to natural transformative processes within the Earth it self. This has its own special sphere, the forma- tion of which is associated w ith very specific preconditions. Without any inter-exchange between s pheres there would be no alternating potential. Nothing in Nature ever happens directly or in any logical sequence, Every transformation results in a complete change in the type of inner poten- tial. This is why mechanistic river regulation is inevitably doomed to failure. It is rhythm that orders transformation a nd it is only in this way that the 'trans- mutable' (water) can retain its natural properties. It will become the most dan- gerous enemy of every living thing, how ever, if it is no longer able peacefully to pursue its way of life and to rege nerate its power of reproduction and upward evolution. In the light of this, the present state of the world and all contemporary world-views, including all existing doctrines, axioms and dog- mas, will have to be changed equally fundamentally. Even air-pressure is subjected to constant change. The higher the altitude, we are told, the more rarefied the air becomes. At the very highest levels there is supposed to be an absolute voi d, a no-thingness. This is where fun- damental error and nonsense, and the dangerous influences of religious belief begin. These would be viewed qu ite differently toda y, had the natural processes of evolution been allowed to continue. This belief would then be just as impossible as belief in the Law of Constant Conservation of Energy and the absolute omnipotence of God. Without the build-up of potencies, without the increase of potentiated matt er and without an intensification of these potentialities, even Lord God would be powerless. All these things are entirely dependent on the cycloidal movement of water and air. Nothing can reproduce a nd upwardly evolve itself of itself, nor can it increase and qualitatively im prove itself exclusively with its own internal resources. We are therefore confronted by the greatest crime and stupidity of all time: the elimination of the cycloidal movement of water. This has buried alive the source of all synthesis of quality. Had a little more attention been paid to the inner behaviour of water after the mechanical extraction of its gas-content, which immediately changes the freezing and boiling points, the conclusi on could then have been drawn that opposites react differently to suction a nd pressure. The same is true for the changes that occur when water is boile d and subsequently re-cooled, which also alters its freezing and boiling points. It should also have been possible to understand why water cannot be raised higher than 10m (33ft) with suc- tion pumps. If water is moved naturale squely, however, then it rises to any desired height almost without any mechanical inducement. Consequently"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"all contemporary systems of pumping lose their validity, which in any case are very expensive to operate, quite apart from degrading the water itself. Naturally-moving water multiplies itself. It raises its own quality and wells up autonomously. It changes its freezing and boiling points. Wise Nature makes use of this phenomenon to raise water to the highest moun- tain peaks without pumps, as in the case of high mountain springs. The term 'raise' should not be taken litera lly, since here it concerns a natural process of reproduction and higher development. This further serves the egenesis of the air, the upward outbirth or creation of an aeriform envelope, which in turn enables the evolut ion of higher forms of life. When the increased, ennobled, specifica lly heavier, dense and cool water springs forth from a spring, it surrenders its surplus levita tional substances. In consequence it charges itself with gravitational substances and flows downwards. Starting from the very smal lest beginnings, it gradually devel- ops into a mighty river. If a spring is divested of its natura l protection (shade-g iving trees, cool rocks, etc.) then the cool spring-water becomes warm and absolutely (not specifically) lighter. Shortly thereafter it loses its natural power to rise and in consequence disappears. No water - no life. Here springs - there life. The Energetic Phenomenon above the Zone of Air What lies above the atmosphe ric envelope is neither rarefied air, nor is it a vacuum. It is a phenomenon of negative energy, the opposite of positive air- pressure. This very special kind of low or negative pressure comes into being when geospheric, levitational ma tter atomically consumes (binds) substances, creating positive air-pressure. Thereupon what Goethe called the 'Eternally Female', comes into be ing. It draws everything upwards and to itself and also maintains the heavy Earth-masses in unstable equilibrium. The tremendous weight of the Earth-ma sses, therefore, has the task of restraining the levitational forces. Th e weight of these masses alone would not be enough if the physically-ponderou s air-pressure, or more accurately, the most finely-dispersed varieties and masses of atmospheric water bear- ing down on the Earth, did not reinforce the Earth's weight. The Earth's force of gravity, therefore, is insu fficient to prevent the Earth-masses from floating upwards. In order to overcome this so-called gravity, all that is nec- essary is to bind the over-burdening air pressure atomically, in the way that wise Nature shows us in every vortex of air.

In other words, the propellent must first be generated in the atmos phere, which geospheric surpluses can then consume. The outcome of this is the true levitational force that holds the Cosmos together. The almost cost- free possibility of overcoming the so- called force of gravity depends upon the naturalesque binding and genera- tion of the essential propellent. Without gravitation there would be no levitation, and conversely, no down-fall without a prior up-rise. And now to the question: which of these is more important or takes precedence? The answer is not all that simple, because both processes have to take place simultaneously. The egg, so to speak, has to be born at the same time as the hen. In this context Goethe writes: \"Nature is neither core nor coveri ng; she is both at once\". In practical terms this means that there are fructig ens, fertilising substances and carrier substances. These are distinct opposite s and move in different directions. However, all of them have to operate on a common axis, whereby fertilising substances have to be moved by centr ifugence, and fructigens by centripe- tence. In addition they must all rotate about each other. This art is called the cycloid form of motion - where care must be taken to ensure that the fructigens move at a speed corresponding to the sum of both speeds squared. This speed is necessar y and central to the aim of building up qualigen, from where the Goddess 'quality', the immortalised 'Eternally Female', the marvel of levitation, is ultimately born. This involves the rebirth of a mysterious ur-force, wh ich comes into being when the power- supplying medium (oxygen) pressing dow n on the Earth is consumed in the realm of the atmosphere, or becomes bound in an atomic (diffuse) state. World Domination through the Destruction of Quality If humanity is to be controlled, quality has to be destroyed. If the excellence of water and the wholesomeness of food is destroyed, then the quality of human thought-processes deteriorates. Th e simplest way of achieving this was to eliminate the cycloid movement of water. Science was established and launched on its misguided path in order to develop a technology and mechanical power that exploited a form of energy which, in Nature, leads to degradation and destruction. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that under such circ umstances few or no elements of quality could evolve. This resulted in a spiritual and mental tor- por, the prerequisite for mastery over th e broad mass of the people. Science invented the Law of Constant Conser vation of Energy and in addition for- bade any questioning of it. Against th is background of increasing intellectu- al apathy, science then undertook the de plorable task of \"leading all mankind"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"around by the nose on an ever more barren heath\", as Goethe so aptly put it. For lack of quality and substance the st ruggle for survival became more and more difficult and beyond all endurance. Was it thus such a surprise that the poor wretches of humanity had to be promised eternal salvation in another realm? A poet once wrote: Into thy daily occupation, Transience needs interpolation. Yearly thou'llst have confirmation, Nought's more true than transformation. Naturally it requires a certain courage to tell the truth! There would, howev- er, be no point, if it did not arouse curiosity as to how the 'transmutable' water could be produced with the ai d of a suitable device. The only way these can be built is by emulating Na ture's processes. Mechanical power will then be free as no intelligent person will still continue to build an explo- sion motor. It is equally obvious that once the unholy trinity of business, sci- ence and religion have disappeared w ithout trace, all humanity will once more awaken to a life worthy of human beings. This can be achieved by such machines as the Repulsator and the Repulsine. 69 The former is used to create a superabundance of food, and the latter to create the almost absolute and continually renewable freedom of movement. How the Repulsator can lib erate the world from hunger will now be addressed. The Repulsator and the Superabundance of Food The Repulsator is a faithful copy of the Earth and its functions. In order to be moved cycloidally, warm and stale wa ter sinks into the Earth where it is subjected to the influence of geospher ic energy. In binding this positively charged propellent the water becomes negatively charged, reconstitutes itself, and bursts of energy stream upw ards to great heights. Some of these will be absorbed by the roots of vegetation and transformed into matter. The remainder rise into the atmosphere, there to be forced to interact with cos- mic energy. In the Repulsator the same process of growth and transformation takes place. However, the products of re valuation (non-spacial, formless, structuring forces) are not able to escape, because the containing vessel is well insulated and sealed. In this way unlimited quantities of levitating 69 These two devices are described in The Energy Revolution, vol.4 of the Ecotechnology Series. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"mother-elements can be successfully in corporated into stale water.

If such water is sipped slowly, then an impotent man will regain his po tency. This water restores youth and rebuilds uplifting energies. It gives th e human, animal and plant organism renewed potency, life-force and mobility. Paracelsus called this elixir of life, the ur-stuff of love. He was unable to discover it himself because he used fire when trying to prepare it. Leonardo da Vinci named this primary energiser of life 'II Primo Motore' (the prime mover). Its distillation tormented him al l his life. Goethe referred to this uplifting substance as the 'Eternally Fe male'. More precisely, it should be called the 'Immortalised Feminine As pect', the growth-promoting Goddess of Quality. It is She that enfolds the Earth and maintains it in a gyrating, unstable state of equilibrium, and it is only through cycloidal motion that quantity can be transformed into levitational or uplifting force. In Nature this process takes place c ontinuously which, expressed as life- energy, is the reason for the progressiv e intensification and increase of true ur-potency. Coming from the Beyond, it is a higher influence that activates growth. Growth is none other than the waste-product of qualigenic ener- gies, which as they rise upwards are solidified by the direct influences of light and heat. This also explains th e extraordinarily vigorous growth when plants are watered with such mother-water. The true process of noble fertili- sation takes place according to a principle similar to the one Sven Hedin describes in his book The Flight of the Great Horse. 70 Called 'Holy Water' by the ancients (a variety being genuine Greek fire-water 71 ), this extremely potent mother-water is incombustible. It does ignite in the light of the Sun, however, if it is overcharged with phosphorus compounds. If such water is atomised in a cylinder and a modicum of atmospheric oxygen is introduced, then all that is need ed is the slight heating pressure of a descending piston to transform, in a split second, the highly potent moth- er-water into an aeriform state. What happens is that an instantaneous egen- esis (upward outbirth) of air occurs, leading to a 1,700-fold increase in volume. This potential pressure can be intensified at will by repeating the process, because the decisive ethericities are almost non-spacial and without form. Therefore they can be incorporated into this natural dynagen accumu- lator in unlimited quantity, the accumulator itself becoming a reservoir of 70 See references in 'Organic Syntheses', p. 153 of this book, and 'Natural Farm Husbandry' in The Fertile Earth, vol. 3 of the Ecotechnology series. - Ed. 71 'Greek fire': Is a combustible, highly ignitable composition, which caught alight when wetted, for setting fire to an enemy's ships, also known as St Elmo's fire, elixir vitae or corposant fire.

(Implosion Magazine, No.19) Dear Dr M G, thank you for your interesting letter and I would like to answer your questions in a very unscientific way thus. The old foresters, huntsmen and fishermen and their wives at th e spinning wheel, sought through old fairy-tales, to explain the mysterious steadfastness of trout standing motion- less in the axis of flowing springwater. It was rumoured that the souls of the departed were to be found in such springs. They were supposed to be slowly released from their decomposing earthly remains in the cool womb of Mother Earth. Gradually coming together in tumbling streams and migrating upstream, where upon reaching the spring they became charged with a purifying ascending current. This current also draws a certain quantity of springwater with it in order then to be able to rise heavenwards. As a four-year old, I wanted to have a close look at this migration of souls and in the process fell into the ice-co ld water. The maid-servant fished me out and administered stout blows, shaking the water out of my lungs and stomach. She then took me into the kitchen and angrily sat me down on the kitchen sideboard, where my shocked mother took over. While my clothes were being changed, she delive red an unforgettable lecture. \"You silly boy! How on earth can you go to that water, where the poor souls journey towards the mountains. They will attract you, pull you in, drown you, and then you die and have to go with them. When you are grown up and not before, if one day have pressing problems, then, my young man, go to the springbrook, where my soul will also be and which will then give you motherly advice and help you when I am no longer on this Earth.\" Thirty years later as a young forester, I was going to lose my job due to the inexploitability of the timber in remote stands of a forest reserve. It was due to be administered by a cheaper gamekeeper instead.

My mother's spirit did not answer and, disappoint- ed, I wanted to cross over the stream, using my staff as a vaulting pole. Trying to find a secure purchase for the end of my staff on the smooth, rocky stream-bed, I flushed a stationa ry trout from its lair, which fled upstream like lightning. Two questions shot into my head: firstly, how do trout reach these high places? Secondly, just how was it possible th at there, right in the axis of the current, a large number of fish were able to stand almost motionless? Steering themselves with only slight movements of their tail-fins, how were they able so effortlessly to overcom e their own weight and the specific weight of the heavy water flowing against them? Was it the souls migrating towards the mountains that drew the fish along in their wake? Or did an axial, biomagnetic force prevail which also prevented the downstream acceleration of heavy logs, and yet which, through mysterious counter-forces of suction, made their transport down the central axis possible? To cut a long story short, this is how I dis- covered animalistic earth-sap-blood magnetism, which enables the naturally flowing, planetarily inward-spiralling water-masses to maintain their steadiness of flow in variable gradie nts. This steadying force is rendered inoperative if the watercourse is regulated and straightened out. It is also extinguished if springwater is centr ifuged in high-spee d, iron (steel) pressure-turbines. Professor Ernst Ferdinand Sauerbruch discovered the organic low-pres- sure chamber that lies between the pleura and the surface of the lungs, which functions as a biological vacuum and enables the inhalation of breathable matter and the resistance-free expansion of the lungs. Professor Sauerbruch was not aware, however, th at this phenomenon is only possible through planetary motion. In this pro cess positive atmosphe ric pressure is countered by a negative pressure, vari able at will, whose power increases by the square of the in-winding rota tional velocity. Moreover, if water is centrifuged, positive pressure increase s in precisely the same measure, resulting in the lateral ejection of bipol ar sediments. The naturalesque way, however, is to centripetalise them along the central axis. Otherwise a bio- electric nuclear axis surrounded by a decadent magnetic field will develop (as with electromagnets) at the same time as a diamagnetic, oxygen- repelling, but nonetheless iron-attracting magnetic f unction. In this case a pole-reversal occurs, i.e. an atomic excess pressure evolves in the longitudi- nal axis of a watercourse, which makes all respiration and insuction of dif- fuse, atmospheric oxygen impossible. Th e water inevitably suffocates, and with further direct or indirect ove r-illumination it decomposes due to the increasingly aggressive concentration of oxygen."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"If water is made to move in a pre dominantly centrifugal manner, an X- ray-like radiation is pro duced, which is me result of warm processes of dis- tillat i o n (fermentation) in the zone where the raw materials and basic substances are present. This mainly emanates in a horizontal direction, drawing decomposing matter into its wake and encrusting the wall-sur- faces, as occurs in sclerosis. It triggers off add itional heating effects which naturally are at the expense of formativ e and levitative atomic energies. This occurs when the temperature of a river is raised to bathing temperature in summer, which, if the rate of flow approximates 800 million cubic metres (1,046 million cu yds) of water per second, requires a further expenditure of energy of about 60 million horsepower (to heat up l m 3 of water by only 0.1°C, requires an additional heat i nput in the order of 42,700 kilogram metres). The fact that energies are also bi polar has therefore been overlooked; which form of energy is activated is solely dependent on the type of motion of the medium in question (be it earth, air or water). Through the agency of warm or cold fermentation processes in the raw material zone, it is either the bioelectric, decomposive or biomagnetic, levitative energy-form that in the end prevails. In an unnaturally-regula ted waterway or a river channelled through steel pressure turbin es, increases in heat oc cur, which are identical to those in atomic piles when uraniu m (which is actually represented in every cell as a form of sediment) is bombarded with neutrons. Every leaf, every pi ne-needle, every eggshell, gill, lung, or piece of bark is a diffusion system that possesses the same accommodating capacity as the pupil of the eye. It dilates or cons tricts, permitting only the passage of regenerative, refreshing and almost heatless oxygenic elements. It also absorbs those elements that are develo pmentally harmful. More precisely, it ejects them centrifugally, because they are endowed with enormous veloci- ties. An indirect centrifugal effect is activated in this way, which purifies the entraining, half sucked-in, half pre ssed-in seminal matter. Any motion of bipolar entities always evolves through the agency of two components of motion - and what really matters here is which of the two components, suc- tion or pressure, predominates. The regul ation of this rhythmical (intrinsi- cally dynamic) interplay of forces so that the suction component prevails is an art, which is only possible through a predominantly planetary form of mass-movement. All over-illumination or over-heating, whether this takes place directly or techno-academically, weakens the biomagnetism that attracts and draws in animalistic oxygen. The same also occurs when toxic fumes are inhaled. Asthma and blood circulation disorders are the biological consequences of the type of motion that intensifies heat and reverses the polarity of the biomagnetic, axial force."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"I could write you a book showing the errors committed by those in acade- mies, universities and schools of high er education, who only know how to move bipolar masses when centrifuge nce predominates and pressure and heat intensify. They are ignorant of the life-curves which are made possible through a predominantly centripetal, planetary system of moving earth, blood, water and sap that re duces heat and pressure. With the latter, giving due attention to the number of revolutions, it is possible to approach the anomaly point; the temperature zero-point of every manifestation of life. At this point the negatively supercharged inner ele- ments of a seed, sediment or a cell beco me highly active, whereas positively supercharged energy-concentrates b ecome passive. They become con- densed, and after being atomised mechanically, are bound by negatively supercharged energy-concentrates. The end-product of this interaction is biomagnetism. It emanates its sur- plus energy mainly in a vertical direction. If conducted through vacuum tubes, the tubes radiate a bluish-green shimmer of light. In contrast, the other forces exhibit a dark red, str ongly pulsating light-effect at the periph- ery of a vacuum bulb. The former are the spiritual (atomic), biomagnetic and animating ethericities, which on th eir upward path attract and draw in surrounding atmospheric oxygen in its diff used state. In the process a torna- do-like, upwardly-widening and water-precipitating ur-cyclone is triggered off, which draws up the whole mass of th e Earth. This force is encircled by an expanding development of solidifying entities, which prevent the rup- ture of the Earth. The peoples of an cient cultures, who made excessive use of planetary motion, must therefore inadvertently have brought about the break-up of Atlantis. However, gravitation and levitation can be regulated by mechanically- produced motion. With this comes liberation, independence from physical and spiritual ponderousness. Gravita tion really only reigns in our atmospheric living space, for above th is weightlessness prevails. Using this insight, I built the Repulsine in Mauthausen concentration camp. At the end of the war the models, prototypes and working drawings fell into Russian hands, and as so-called 'flying saucers' they will soon flit around the world like phantoms. Th ese craft do not stem from higher beings, but rather from a forester who merely turned the Ressel pressure-screw inside out.

The same applies to pres sure-turbines used in hydroelectric power gener- ation and hence with its soul removed, the groundwater must sink over wider and wider areas as the rate of rotation increases through the steepening of the intake gradient.

The best fuel is air which, when decomposed organically in ca pillary tubes (doub le-spiral pipes), enables the indirect metamorphosis of spacial substances (gases) into non- spacial matter (electrozoic energies). Through this rearrangement of atoms (atomic transformation — not atomic disint egration) it is possible to generate heat and cold organically in the same way that Nature shows us every- where. As a further consequence, the possibility presents itself not only of producing the other transitional energies of light and dark artificially, but also the ur-produced intermediate co mpounds in Nature, which we com- monly describe as proteins. These substances are pr oduced through concentration of the three spacial dime nsions of solid, liquid and gaseous + cosmic radiation. The result of these five-dimensional interactive influences is: Juvenile earth - juvenile water - juvenile air.

The form and function of these remains are reversed through their transformation in the Earth and become the dynamic substances in th e immediately following life-phase, which re-animate those still at a lower st ate of organisation. In this eternal flow, in this uninterrupted process of form-generating motion and motion-gen- erating form, 74 one organ plays a decisive role, which we can observe every- where. This organ is the pulsating double-spiral tube (whorl-pipe), the capillary (or the capillary system), wh ich is to be understood as something entirely different from contemporary science's conception of a capillary tube. Air and water are intermediate organisms whose task is to connect the above and below. These intermedia te substances are always enclosed within a third, neutral substance a nd as 'opposites' move themselves in different ways and directions. To enable this co-active motion a mediator is therefore required, which has two different axes in one and the same profile (egg). Out of this inversely dime nsional (morphological) motion, longitudinal potential (magnetism) and latitudinal potential (electricity) develop. As mechanical and physi cal opposites, pressure and suction are functional dynamic phenomena, which necessarily encounter each other rhythmically and continually through which, according to their proportion and organisation, the indi vidual pattern of motion-generating form or form-generating motion aris es. Every manifestation of life of whatever kind is always a chemico-physical or an electromagnetic process triggered by the cathode and anode system of Sun and Moon. If we are able to trigger this impulse in th e proper way, then further development occurs automatically and we are thus in a position not only to engender growth of a purely physical nature at w ill, but also to potentiate (cause the growth of) pure incorporeal essences (k inetic energies). Accordingly we are already thoroughly embroiled in an entirely new technology which only exploits peak energies and which ha s virtually nothing to do with the over- exploitation of Nature.

It requires a profound per- ception and study of the unified inte rdependencies in Nature through which what we call the Universe, the All, the Whole is created. Life is not an end in itself, but only a means to an end, a Fata Morgana in thousandfold shape and form. It is always the same preconditions that give rise to any given manifestation of life.

The great art is to orga nise and apportion the wonderful inter- relationships in such a way that pract ical means to an end will result. Call them machines if you will.

Their purpose is to accomplish all that we desire to achieve today without making use of our entirely pervert- ed and contrary technology.

In ev ery respect my discoveries bear the hallmarks of the knowledge of bi o-ecological formation possessed by ancient Asian cultures, because th ey already knew these secrets many thousands of years ago and possessed silent aircraft (vimanas), which were able to overcome gravity by a ve ry simple process. Unfortunately, however, contemporary Germans appear to cling to their technical delu- sions and do not seem to want to relinquish them. It is therefore to be feared that they will miss the opport unity, because even now people of other tongues, who are already aware of this inner degeneration in Nature, are more flexible and ar e becoming increasingly interested. Here too we are concerned with impul ses which evolve at lightning speed once the thought ignites. This has happened, because today it is no longer a question of fantasies, but of facts. These are anchored in causes, which were relegated to secondary importan ce while spurious concepts were pursued, whose relevance is everywhere beginning to pale into insignifi- cance.

Will and counter-will are functions of the temperatures that arise for one reason or another. Work is a fu nction of the temperatures that lie above or below the turning point or point of intersection - the anomaly point - in which all life arises (zero-po int). It is of similar nature to what we experience as the 'present', wh ich is a function of an on-going, extremely high velocity flow. This flow is an eternal form-generating motion, which in turn gives rise to the continuous motion-generating form. Thus we arrive at both the fallacious concepts and the explanation of the life that lies between birth and burial, which is the illusion that clothes evolution with reality. Te mperature is thus the difference between differ- ences, out of which the ceaseless movement of evolution arises. This in turn is the product of tensions resulting from the contrasting directions of movement. The movement of the planets is mirrored in the movement of earthly bodies and so the possibility also exists to order the cour se of planetary systems by means of a particular phy sical motion. Conversely, it is also possible to exploit planetary motion to produce physical motion, which will enable us to harness a constantly waxing motive force for our own use. Opposites have their appointed directions of movement and find their expression in the interchangeab ility of the substances that live and move. If we can now succeed in dosing like-di rectional dynagens and in bring- ing the groups of substances thus or ganised into mutually opposing motion, then a maximal motion will result. Its harmonic counterpart is the creation of the minimal form of motion, because the latter represents the totality in a single point. This is the turning or an omaly point out of which is born the physically self-embodying form-generating motion arising from the motion- generating form. This physical formation is the product of organic formative processes and it is obvious that in order to construct such physical forms, we must make use of certain basic shapes. This basic shape we find in the ellipse, which once set in motion, pro- duces the mirror-image, opposite form. As the natural counterpart, the latter also creates the opposite temperament or reciprocal temperatures, which on their part give rise to the tensions and the form of motion associated with them."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Since we are concerned here with pure morphological patterns, there can be no state of equilibrium and therefore that state cannot exist, which we understand as 'rest'. In reality this apparent rest is the very highest state of motion and at the same time it is the point of material transformation. It is also the point of ur-generation of the most purely spiritual dimension, which transforms itself at the speed of lightning into movement or form, through which the thing in question f unctions independently and is thus energised from within. Conversely, this two-fold motion is also the origin of life, which on its part continually transforms itself both without and within. If we should now succeed in maintaining any given substance, for instance water, in a constant state of change and transformation, then we are presented with the eternal growth-g enerating motion. This produces the motion-generating form, which we can tran sform by indirect means into that which is described as 'energy' in today's terminology. With this we are well on the way to a technology that will usher in and order the coming biological age. The basic principle of this natural technology is the resistanceless motion that naturally and necessarily result s from the evolutionary motion- generating form. As this form evolves to a higher state of organisation, it automatically vacates the place it occupied as it moves upward as form- generating motion. Bio-Ecological Technology From the Special Edition of Mensch und Technik Vol. 2,1993, section 3.3. The picture of the world and its motion, sketched here in broad outline, are the foundations for the future which is biological technology. Essentially this is founded on the possibility of sh ifting the subjective centre of gravity. Through inner-atomic restructuring with the aid of mutators, the centre of gravity within an inversely dimensional plane begins to wander within and about itself, i.e. it always manifests itself at different points as a subjec- tive present. The precondition for this self-moving, spiralling motion is the planetary construction of elliptical bodies of certain interrelated magni- tudes. Their contrasting directions of motion give rise to two inversely pro- portional energy-fields of opposite poten tial. This results in the formation of a nucleus that rotates about its own axis and which, like the yolk of an egg, floats freely in the organic centre -point, in the life-point or anomaly point. This organic anomaly point is the zero-point, as it were, of the elliptical formative body, or the point of rotation of the mutually inversely-moving"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"organic and inorganic masses. This organic motion is the origin of the eter- nal creation-of-motion and the cause of the ceaselessly changing pattern of day and night, heat and cold, life and death, livery substance of whatever kind has come into being naturally. Henc e it is of divine nature, immortal and thus in constantly transmuting form. Whatever appears as spacially vis- ible bodies in the present, reconstitu ted itself in the past and returns in exalted form as transformed future. Between the purely spiritual and purely physical dimensions of transformation lie the metamorphic and non-spacial intermediate dimensions, which are inst rumental in the pr ocesses of trans- position. Heat and cold, light and dark are likewise intermediate dimensions of these perpetually self-reconstituting magnitudes. For this reason and with the aid of these wonderful inte rmediate forms, we human beings are also in a position to move masses with unlimited power. Providing that is, we understand how to organise the special interrelati onships harmoni- cally. All motion is a function of so-cal led temperatures, which begin to structure themselves, if we place th e thing in the organic life-point (the anomaly point of water is +4°C). For this reason the only true and proper work of god-like and thus creative humanity is the organisation of the planetary drive-mechanism. This we must be able to order spacially and energetically (non-s pacially) in such a wa y that an autonomous, organised cycle comes into being through which a constantly self- evolving motion arises, which as so-called 'power' we can then make use of. This type of use is no ruinous exploitation, but rather the reinforcement of the all-prevailing and moving will (of God). To serve Nature means to com- mand her wisely, and for this reason t hose who humbly revere Nature, will perceive her mysterious processes and in response will give substance to the will of that which moves and animates everything. The Age-Old Secret of the Atom From Implosion Magazine, No.74 The physics of today will collapse like an uninteresting house of cards once the age-old secret of the atom has been revealed. Then it will at last be realised that apart from life-destroy ing atomic energies, which kill off all growth and other forms of life, there are also life-giving energies with a multiplying and ennobling function.

In Nature all life springs from so-called transi- tional bacteriophagous essences. 75 These should be regarded as the ur-origin of all physical existence, and more im portantly as the source of the physical- ly first-born - water. Life is recitative - that is to say, all deceased life reverts to the metaphysical. Forces therefore also exist whose functi on is to mortify, and which come into being after the animating forces have been extin- guished. The former have been a bone of contention between secular and religious leaders for years. Each threatens the other, having no conception of the true nature and purpose of the recipe or the formula that was given long ago, which having been disregarded, has heralded in the universal decline of all Life. Atomic energies are primordial - even more ancient than life on Earth. Without them there would be no quickening, animating energies. They come into being when solid, liquid and gaseous masses are accelerated in accordance with Einstein's equation: Strangely enough, it has never been st ated that the acceleration inherent in this equation could equally be app lied to functions that are in-rolling, formative and concentrative, as it has to those that are out-rolling, destructive and decentrative. If it is borne in mind that these two forms of motion are associated with two different types of atomic energy, then we begin to approach, or we are directly confronted by, the pro- found and veiled knowledge of Sais, whose disclosure according to ancient legend, was punished by death 76 . However, prophecies must be interpreted relatively. The death-ray can just as easily hit those who had 75 According to Collins Englis h Dictionary a bacteriophag e is \"a virus that is parasitic in a bacterium and multiplies within its host, which is destroye d when the new viruses are released.\" Here the meaning of bacterio phagous has little to do with bacteria as such, but tries to express the notion of highly subtle, autonomous entities within entities endowed with the potential to impart life- or death-decisive influences. - Ed. 76 To give a greater understanding of events at Sais, that ancient Egyptian city in the Nile delta, the Secret Doctrine by H P Blavatsky relates: \"...And how little Herodotus could tell is confessed by him- self when speaking of a mysterious tomb of an In itiate at Sais, in the sacr ed precinct of Minerva. There, he says 'behind the chapel is the tomb of One, whose name I consider it impious to divulge... In the enclosure there are large obe lisks and there is a lake near, surrounded with a stone wall in a circle. In this lake they perform, by night, that person's adventur es, which they call mysteries. It is well to know that no secret was so well-preserved and so sacred w ith the ancients as that of their cycles and computations. From the Egyptians down to the Jews it was held as the highest sin to divulge anything pertaining to the correct measure of time. It was for divulging the secrets of the Gods, that Tantalus was plunged into the infernal regions; the keepers of the sacred Sybilline Books were threatened with the death pe nalty for revealing a word of them .\" The Secret Do ctrine, Vol II, p.396. - Ed.

In consequence, all the nuclear physics and the methodology con- cerning work and motion presently taught in a l l technical colleges and uni- versities will no longer be valid, and indeed should even be prohibited by law. For every action there is a reaction. Therefore a rapid succession of activat- ing impulses or chain reactions arise, whose characteristic effect solely depends on whether a given mass-motio n is initiated by pressure or suction. It is a known fact that all motion is conditioned by different forms of kinetic energy (pressure and suc tion). Hitherto unknown, however, is that a motion triggered by pressure gives rise to reactive, decomposive radiation. Its effect is to increase th ermal activity, which in all machines is commonly referred to as resistance. In motion of this kind, the resistance to motion increases by the square of the centrifugal acceleration of the rotational velocity. Such motion is therefore not only irrational, but it also impedes growth and developmen t. Moreover all centrifugal systems of motion of masses, where pressure and heat increase, results in the molec- ular dissociation of the masses moved in this unnatural manner. This explains why biological, ecological a nd economic decline is occurring in those countries where academic (technical) methods of mass-motion prevail. On the other hand: if movement is tr iggered by traction or suction, then an increase in power and efficiency results. This is due to the cooling, reac- tive forces evolving during this dyna mic process, which manifest them- selves as levitation. Levitation is a forward and upward surge which is intensified by reactions and founded on processes of molecular revalorisa- tion. The resultant product is qualigen, which is the basis of all natural repro- duction and higher evolvement, and th e increase and ennoblement of all growth. There can be no doubt that th e type of motion inaugurated, and the reactive forces (dynamic, atomic functi ons) associated with it, determine whether economic growth or decline, progress or regressi on, happiness or misery, war or peace, are to follow. According to ancient knowledge, the world can be turned upside down and the natural course of evolution totally perverted if a retroactive motive impulse is given. However, if the correct, opposite impulse is imparted and the resultant motion is allowed to proceed unchecked, then equally devastating catastrophes will occu r. Referred to in the Bible as 'The Flood', the Atlantean cataclysm was proba bly triggered off in just such a way through the over-stimulation of levitational forces (atomic, upsuctional forces), which ripped whole sections of the Earth skywards and atomised them."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The action of atomic energies that unleash the sacred fire in aqueous bodily fluids are substantially diffe rent. The ancient Jews called it 'Greek Fire' with which they set fire to sacrificial animals by sprinkling them with this energy concentrate before sunrise. According to the age-old scriptures, as the Sun rose, an almighty fire flared up that consumed the sacrificial beasts. The primitive people then sank to their knees and stammered out prayers of thanksgiving, for the fire was a sign that Jehovah had accepted their sacrifice. With these supposedly magic arts the high priests of both Indo-Germ anic and Mosaic cultures ruled over the masses in order to force them to work and pay taxes. Just how the tax- raising financial power-structures came into being will be apparent to all who can read between the lines of what has so far been stated and what fol- lows. In bygone eras secular and religi ous knowledge resided in the same hands, because in those days savants were thoroughly versed in the art of controlling both kinds of atomic energy. They were thus able to regulate the supply of food and raw materials with the use of reproductive and upward- ly evoluting forces. However, they di d not let them get out of hand. These erudite men were likewise aware of th e necessity for purifying forces. They knew that without a natural, healthy stockpile of bio-ecological residues and their naturalesque interment, none of the vital forces could be brought forth that enable the constant increa se and qualitative improvement of pos- terity. Without intuition (that extraordinar y connection with Nature) this sublime art of controlling atomic forc es is impossible. For this reason the final effect of bio-ecological di sturbances could not be foreseen and we are now experiencing the consequences. In other words, this is simply the foregone bio-ecological conclusion of an intentional or unintentional suppression of life-giving forms of atomic energy. Because no one knew of the essential nature and th e genesis of low-grade, pressure- creating, atomic forces i.e. decomposive energies, grave errors in motion could not be appreciated fo r what they were, and therefore continued to be made by the whole of science. Like a team of horses, science was used to bring about the intended developmental standstill in order to facilitate the regulation of supply and demand, and thereby the value of money, as desired. This import and export trade in basi c commodities, coupled with occa- sional shortages in other necessities of life, could only be manipulated as long as there were sufficient surpluse s of goods in high demand. Therefore the need arose for a variable monetary value and rate of exchange.

They took great sati sfaction, even if unconsciously, in the progressive vitality of their various kinds of produce. Like wild game on the free and open prairie, they knew ne ither hardship nor stimulants of any kind. In order to open up new markets in these regions too, what could have been simpler than to reco mmend these supposedly labour-saving machines to these 'primitive' peoples? From then on, the faster the heat and pressure-sensitive me dia of earth, water and air were forced to move unnat- urally, the more dangerous the cell and tissue-rupturing, de-animating forces became. These then triggered off all-consuming fire and cold inflam- mation. Nobody seems to have known or had an y idea that if everything is rela- tive, then motion must also be bipolar in nature. In view of this, Einstein's Law of Equivalence between Mass and Energy is an error of the gravest consequence, because it entirely depe nds on the type of motion, whether life-affirming or life-negating atomic energies, surplus growth or mass pri- vation ultimately prevail. The energies that have been produced so far are the same as those that physicists genera te in a split second in nuclear bombs, except they work far more slowly. The delayed effect of these decomposive energies only manifests itself much later, and as a result will perhaps no longer be explicable to futu re generations. It would appear that both Eastern and Western leaders are still ignorant of these two different forms of atomic energy. They are theref ore forced to struggle for supremacy, threatening to make use of the weapons of annihilation that science has made available to them. The spread of centrifugal methods of exploiting atomic energies will have even further unforeseen conseq uences. Even the lives of the high and mighty will be in doubt, when one day hydrogen bombs begin to rain down from radar-controlled aircraft and rockets. The point of this undoubtedly bad joke is that up to now nobody had any idea who the real joker is. He kept well out of the limeli ght and simply discredited laws that were held to be sacred by the ancient oracles, because they can be interpret- ed in two different ways. This joker even went as far as to negate the validi- ty of Nature's immutable laws by d eclaring the opposite - relativity - to be a conformity with natural law. Ind eed on more than one occasion he sup- pressed the fact that the motion of all the constellations in the cosmos is planetary. In doing so, however, he also made a blunder which, on closer examination, could bring about the coll apse of the whole edifice of science and academia. As a spherical shape, were the Earth de facto to move centrifugally, then there would be no biomagnetic, longitudina l axis and no attractive or gravi-"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"tational force. Without exception, these would have been fallacies for the simple reason that, due to the uncontrollable interactions arising from con- stantly-fluctuating temperatures, no state of equilibrium is possible. These interactions can only be controlled by lowering the temperature through the centripetal movement of mass. A state of equilibrium can then be main- tained, and although not wholly consta nt, it nevertheless produces a steady succession of chain-reactions which serve the build-up of higher quality atomic energies. The fact that centrifuga l systems of motion of ma sses provoke a feverish, diseased condition in all living organism s is today beyond dispute. Modern technology and its perverted, unnatura l processes therefore represent the deliberate applicatio n of a deception designed to make the working popula- tion unconditionally dependent on financ ial power-brokers. Moreover it has produced such an estrangement from Na ture that the point has now been reached where students in technical colleges and universities are taught laws that neither exist nor apply in Nature. Professor Hahn's achievement of splitting the atom follows the same sequence of events that occurs in every process of physical disintegration. A negative concentration of ma tter is bombarded with unfiltered positive rays, during which negative fructig ens release more energy than the radiation or electron-guns are able to use. According to the type of radiation, these can penetrate all resistance and pierce right through to the cell-nucleus (atomic nucleus) and split it apart, triggering an unstoppable process of regressive development. The Implosive Process of Breathing All life breathes. It can also be said that all that breathes is alive. Breathing is controlled not physically, but me taphysically. When breathing ceases it means that the functional force, here called life-force, has been extin- guished - upon whose continuing existe nce all respirati on depends. Life- force is synonymous with the higher-grade, animating atomic energy that serves life. All this and the following would be easier to understand if the process of breathing were to be described as th e pulsebeat of a life-energising motor. If preceded by an explosion, a powerfu l vacuum develops and fresh fuel rushes into the void thus created. Exactly the same thing happens with implosion, which arises when a reduced fructigen originat ing from the Earth (negatively-charged) binds or emulsi fies the seminal substances of the atmosphere. The product of this emulsi on is an energy which animates all things."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Without an implosive process al l breat hing is impossible, and an air- pump would be required instead. Every living thing has its own individual body-temperature, which in humans lies at about +36.6°C (97.9°F). Any change foreshadows the onset of disease. At +36.6°C the body is able to emulsify in-drawn atmospheric oxyge n and build up its vitalising forces. The significance of the Indian art of breathing (prana-yoga) therefore becomes quite apparent. This process of inner evolution or internalisation (implosion) can be produced mechanically and signals the nemesis of the greatest self-deception and betrayal of humanity, the technology that exploits retroactive reactions. Processes of respiration that were previously unknown will now be briefly described. Through th e intake of food and th e consumption of water, predominantly negatively-charged s ubstances stemming from the Earth reach the digestive system. Here they are purified and exalted, and enter the hermetically sealed blood and sap circulation systems by way of diffusion. Under no circumstances do blood or sap ever move centrifugally in the body, as any observation of the blood a nd sap streams will reveal. This is further enhanced by the presence of trace-elements in the walls of all high- grade vessels which, as catalysts, play a decisive role in the emulsion of the transported media. It is therefore quite apparent that the relative proportions and activity of bipolar pressure-inducing substan ces determine whether a drop or a feverish rise in temperature ensues ; the latter leading to sickening and degenerative after-effects. If the characteristic temperature level suited to the continuing existence of the respective organism alters, then the vacuum, the prerequisite for breathi ng, no longer functions. Here lies the great yawning gap in contemporary physics. Nuclear physicists are thoroughly conversant with the hot a nd cold conflagration leading to inflammation, but they are unaware of the heatless, formative processes for producing progressive, repr oductive and upwardly-evoluting (multiplying and ennobling) atomic energies. Everything breathes, even earth, air and water. All will inevitab ly asphyxiate if reduced fructigenic ethericities (food) are unable to bind (e mulsify) diffuse seminal ethericities, so creating the vital biological vacuum which produces hunger in the digestive tract and a demand for air in the respiratory system (lungs, gills, etc.). This is all conditional on the presence of the necessary basic elements. Had humanity not provoked a fever-stricken condition in them, these would still be available in sufficient quantity and optimal quality. Today we are faced with a situation where those in charge of forestry, water, land and energy resources continue to prolifer ate these destructive forces, and with them the spread of cancer.

By moving water centrifugally, abnormally high reactive pressures, as well as infra- and ultra-red radiation, are pro- duced. These are invisible and undetect able and contrary to Nature. All solid, liquid and gaseous ba sic elements should therefore be moved in the same way that Mother-Ear th gyrates about and within herself along her ideal axis. Higher-grade concentrates of atomic energy radiate their surplus energies mainly in a vertical direc tion. Since negatively-overcharged, bio- magnetic resurrective (ascending) forces are active here, many other things are also drawn up in their wake. This is the case with high-quality fish, for example, which are able to regulate th ese levitational forces with their gills in such a way that they can stand motionless in torrential mountain streams or suddenly dart upstream. In waterfall s they can even float up vertically, if the falling water is able to in-wind natu rally. This also applies to us, for we are not aware of the weight of our bodies if they are healthy and are under the influence of the right temperature-gradient. Only in old age, when levi- tational forces begin to diminish, do we seek warmth and have need of a stick. Divine Service attains its fullest meaning when Nature's formative forces are strengthened by supportive activit y. Humanity will fulfil its ordained purpose when each individual makes a small part of this Earth fruitful and creates the right conditions for persona l and general evolution. The key to healthy and prolific growth is to incr ease the range and quantity of forma- tive forces. People who are healthy, contented and free are peaceable, and peace itself will come about of its own accord, because such people will refuse to take up arms for the sake of the plutocracy. Secret of the Atom - (Conclusion) In the preceding discourse 'the ag e-old secret of atomic energy' was explained in the simplest terms. It was pointed out that, whether reproduc- tive and upwardly-evoluting atomic ener gies evolve from bipolar elements, or whether degenerative carcinogenic energies are produced instead, simply depends on the type of mass-motion of the media of earth, water and air. It was also mentioned that in technical colleges and universities, laws, theo- ries and principles are taught which are founded on the centrifugal, Einsteinian law of energy-generation. On the basis of knowledge acquired in this way, forestry altered the natural methods of planting, conser vation and felling; at the same"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"time transforming shade-giving and shade-demanding mixed forests into mono-cultures. En agriculture, farm machinery was introduced which was not only improperly designed, but unsuitable alloys were also used. Methods of fertilisation were also in troduced which destroyed life in the soil. In science too, mistake was heaped on mistake. Rivers were hydraulically (centrifugally) regulated and mountain streams made to cas- cade in straight channels, thus eliminating any possibility for in-winding motion. Waste-water was discharged in to these regulated waterways with- out first being decontaminated. Even in the power industry they are only aware of the explosive and expansive motive principle. Due to the rapid increase in chain reactions triggered by the action of acceleration-induced pressure, the more developmentally da ngerous its repulsi ve forces will become. All of which justifies the following question: Why has all this happened? The fact cannot be ruled out that huma nity was led astray for speculative reasons. Despite the enormous damage that already leaps to our very eyes, this deceitful behaviour w ill not be discontinued without a struggle. Life-Force and Animating Energies From Implosion Magazine, No.71. \"Atomic energy is freed at the intersection of two temperature-gradients. Whether it has a formative or destructive nature is determined by the form of motion and the alloys used in the manufacture of any mo tion-producing apparatus. The character of each individual is determined by its particular inner climate. Every life-form has its prescribed anomalous condition of health, which enables the orderly reproduction of the species in question. For this reason the world of parasites increases with fever.\" V. S. - (Implosion Magazine, No.71, p.12) This discovery is founded on the know ledge that, from a bio-ecological standpoint, there are two different typ es of mass-motion and hence two dif- ferent forms of atomic energy. The firs t is of an animating nature, and is therefore not only regenerative and evolut ionally up-lifting, but also multi- plying and ennobling. The second form of energy is de-animating, destruc- tive and hence regressive. Both fo rms of motion operate along a common developmental axis and do so simultaneously. The form of atomic energy that ultimately predominates depends on the type of impulse this rhythmi- cal, dynamic process receives. Thes e two types of motion encompass the whole panoply and spectrum of life. This newly-discovered art of regulati on was known to the high priests of ancient cultures and practised by them. They understood how to control the"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"eternal metamorphic flow (panta rhei) in such a way that supply of food and raw materials kept pace with growing pop ulation. It was to this skilful con- trol that the then peaceful progress and high level of culture are to be ascribed. It was all lost thousands of years ago, however, because it was restricted to a small circle for powe r-political reasons, and therefore with- held from the public at large. As a r esult its vitalising effect constantly declined. This ancient knowledge and art of control was rediscovered through observations of the stationary trout over many years, which floats motionlessly amidst torrential flows. At this juncture, an explanation will be attempted. Regenerative atomic energies come into being wh en the media (carriers of bipolar basic elements) of earth, air and water are made to move planetarily. In this case the various sedimentary substances inhere nt in air and water bind the basic element, chemically termed oxygen (solidified solar energy), which carries an opposite charge. Here the principal requirement is the creation of an hermetic seal which excludes all light, heat and air, and the movement of the above media in an in-winding way. In addition, a higher excitation takes place by means of special catalysts. During the process of purification / exaltation, destructive forces of evolution are also released. However, these should only be released in sufficient measure to remove any waste products. As faec al matter and such like, these must be expelled if unwelcome deposits (crystallisations) are to be avoided, or if the decay of residues themselves, while s till in the respective body, is to be prevented. This marvellous reduction-exaltation pr ocess has been disrupted by contem- porary technocrats, because they were only aware of centrifugal methods of mass-movement whose nature is degradi ng and destructive. For this reason, and in conformity with natural inner law, the constant acceleration of a regressive form of development is inev itable in all branches of industry, forestry, agriculture, water and energy resources management. Those princi- pally to blame for this are the lecturers in technical colleges and universities, because they show their students how to achieve apparently lasting results by activating Nature's dissociative en ergies. Having thus been wrongly pro- grammed, these aspiring academics then develop engines and machines, locomotive or otherwise, which serve destruction. These lecturers, who have ignorantly inaugurat ed a social decline enco mpassing the environ- ment and all fields of human endeavour, are therefore to be described as the true brake-appliers of evolution, or as the long sought-after causal agents of cancer. Indeed, if one considers that thro ugh the use of unnatural systems of mass-motion, millions of their unsusp ecting fellow human beings are being denied their most fundamental right-to-life, ultimately to perish w i t h"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"unspeakable suffering (even rotting aliv e), then no word is harsh enough publicly to castigate this fraudulent motion. Life-force can only be maintained through the input of supplementary animating energies. These become arous ed and activated in transformations that take place on in-rolling spiral pa ths. During this process a cooling occurs, which acts as a brake on the destructive effects of oxidation and heat, because it neutralises them. An anomaly state (+4°C for water) is also created which varies from organism to organism and presides over its exis- tence or non-existence. The high prie sts of earlier cultures knew how to manipulate this 'climate' so ably that the anomaly state, the condition of temperaturelessness and feverlessness, was maintained in all forms of life or growth. The variability of temperature stamps every manifestation of life with its individual hallmark. Whenever anyone falls ill, it is an infallible sign that their natural state of indifference or metabolic equilibrium can no longer be maintained. The departure from this normal condition is caused by unde r-cooling or over- heating, by genetica lly-impaired food, feverish water or polluted air. In a word, over-acidic energy-concentrates have been ingested. If a still, station- ary body of water, for example, is too heavily bombarded by unshielded (unbraked) solar rays, or if flowing wa ter is subjected to pressure as it moves, then it becomes over-acidic and develops an unhealthy potency which the organism cannot tolerate. The organism becomes sick, begins to rot and slowly dies as regression takes its course. In the same way that to date no one has managed to produce artificial seawater in which sea fish can survive, nobody else (apart from me) has yet succeeded in producing the nutritive liquid, correctly-cons tituted physiologically , otherwise known as springwater. Nor has anyone so far noticed that mountain springwater can only come into being with the aid of planetary motion. Here various other contributing factors are also involved which create the particular environment necessary for the oxygen component to be bound or emulsified by activated sedimen- tary material. Emulsion signifies that the ethericities (or emanations) of raw materials with opposite poten tial are so intimately intermixed that a third entity is born; as happens in any other procreative event. In practical terms, a child is born which is either male or female, according to the way in which fertilisation occurs. It can also be a hermaphrodite, wh ich through later influences of various kinds can metamorphose into a predominantly male or female life-form. Mountain springwater comes into being when, under diffuse influences of light and heat and the presence of catalytic secondary radiation, geospheric and atmospheri c forms of radiation are thoroughly intermixed. In this way the child, the physically fi rst-born and blood of the Earth, water,"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"is ur-procreated. This physically firs t-born decays and dies if the spring becomes over-illuminated and overheated (when exposed to direct radia- tion and sunlight) in othe r words, over-acidified. If the blood of the Earth is moved in a predominantly centrifugal manner - in an unwinding movement from the central axis towards the periphery - then hitherto-unknown ultrared radiati on evolve which trigger off addition- al heating effects and make oxygen bo th aggressive and destructive. The final effect of this is the creation of a devitalisi ng energy-form which radi- ates in all directions, penetrates all resistances and invades the negatively- charged cell-nucleus. Having been warmed in this way the formerly healthy living cell ruptures and turns into an epicentre of decay, infecting all forms of growth and life in its vicinity, until they too become genetically diseased (impregnated with cancer). An apparently harmless mechanical, physical or psychic excess pressure is therefore able to trigger off localis ed processes of decay in the form of tumorous growths. We can observe these phenomena clearly in over- illuminated and overheated species of shade-demanding timber. The enlargement of the annual rings, the increasingly spongy structure of the wood ('light-induced growth') will then be praised as a 'major achieve- ment of forestry'. This is how the qualigen in monocultures is forcibly degenerated, and how young trees are in fested with cancer. Having thereby been deprived of its reproductive and upwardly-evolving force, the follow- ing generation produces infertile seeds and makes the groundwater cancerous. If we wish to transform seawater or over-acidic fresh water into genetical- ly-healthy drinking water, then this most valuable national asset must be conducted in such a way as to enable water itself to build up new energies again. This relatively simple regenera tive process produces not only geneti- cally-sound drinking and domestic water, but also high-grade healing water that inhibits cancer. In fresh water t hus produced even sea fish are able to exist. If we wish to safeguard humanity and above all our children from a horrible future, today's technology must be replaced by an environ- mentally-friendly bio-ecotechnology a sustainable ec 2 otechnology. 77 The principle has already been established for which pioneering patent applica- tions have been made world-wide, a nd which in part have already been granted.

In a scientific journal, the German Pr ofessor Otto Warburg asserted that he had solved the problem of cancerous growths. According to him, the cancer cell lacked oxygen. A healthy cell is provided with oxygen via the blood. It uses this oxygen to process nutrients. In this way it is supplied with life- energy - in other words, with animating energy. Professor Warburg then made the surprising claim that the cancer cell uses little oxygen. Instead, it ferments nutritive substances into lactic acid. It thereby obtains a great deal of energy and as a result grows faster and divides more rapidly than do ot her cells. No further progress has been made in the treatment and cure of cancer, because no one realised that in accordance with the Law of Bipolarity, there are two forms of energy, the decomposive and the format ive. For this reason the following questions remain unanswered: why does the cell-body suddenly use less oxygen?, and why, with the lack of it, does the cell begin to ferment nutrients, thereby losing some of its life-force a nd turning into a cancer cell? Even Nobel prize winner Professor Gerhard Domagk (1895-1946) failed to answer these questions. As a result it was concluded that there is no causal agent of cancer. Why and under what circumstances does the cell receive too little oxygen? No contemporary science lecturer can answer this crucial question. Because of this and desp ite the millions invested in cancer research, cancer has remained incurable and continues to proliferate and attack it victims. Which form of energy leads to life and which leads to death? The cancer spectre will be laid to rest once the timely provision of sufficient oxygen to the cell has been successfully achieved. The metabolic process will then be altered in favour of the build-up of life itself. This force will then work equally as incessantly as does the destructive force in the opposite case. This concerns the existence or non-existence of all humanity. Cancer caus- es living decay. Unspeakable suffering is concealed behind the walls of clin- ics and hospitals. A cure for cancer is thus of major concern to all humanity, and above and beyond this, the concern of every single human being, rich or poor, minister or street-sweeper alike. The curing and prevention of cancer should under no circumstances be left to science alone. Science has failed right up to the present day. Despite its privileged position, it has not only permitted the spread of cancer in all levels of society, but by using the force of destruction in the field of physics it has actually provoked the development of cancer. On these grounds science "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"is no longer entitled to any furthe r monopoly. The same chances and the same ch al leng es mu st b e giv en to outsiders, and the value of any claims should be judged by results. The final de cision must ultimately rest with the citizen, who has to meet the costs through taxation, and therefore should also have a say in any application of treatments. Why can we, or why must we breathe? Professor Ernst Ferdinand Sauerbruch answered this vital question in 1908. The term 'breathing' is to be under- stood as an attraction or an insuction of diffuse oxygen. This is only possible if a vacuum or a negative pressure exists in the thorax between the pleura and the surface of the lungs. If this negative pressure is lost, due to the effect of excess atmospheric pressure or in flammation, then breathing becomes impossible, and the afflicted life-form inevitably suffocates. Before explaining how this negative pressure evolves, which rules over life or death, we must examine oxygen. Everything that appears in Nature and is perceptible to our eyes and senses, is the waste-product of subtle, exalted energies - left behind, foot-sore and weary on evolution's upward path, it manifests itself as physical matter. All growth should be seen in this light, which as far as pr esent concepts are concerned only occurs through the influence of heat. To put it more succinctly, oxygen is the waste-matter or fallout of solar energy in gaseous form. It is waste-material simi- lar to the one we commonly call nitrogen. Together they form a mixture of gases - the atmosphere - in which, despite their unequal proportions and weights, a labile state of equilibri um prevails. This is controlled by constant fluctuations in temperature in such a way that a periodic drop in pressure and heat occurs and a low or negative pressure is created. The biological consequence of this constant alternation of potentials is a continuous equilibrating motion, whose causes are indiscernible. What is perceptible, however, is the way these causes manifest themselves through up- and down-draughts, whose roles are therefore already of a subordinate nature. It is known that physically-detecta ble motion can be initiated through differences in potential. Hitherto unknown, however, was that motion can also be used to create differences in potential. The decisive factor in this regard is that the resultant e quilibrating motion can not only be con- trolled, but also intensified at will. It can therefore be regulated mechanical- ly in such a way that an upward suction-force evolves which draws everything in its wake, thus negating gravity. One day we will probably be able to explain the cataclysm of Atlant is in this way, of which we have a foretaste in cyclones. These originate through potential differences in the strata of the atmosphere and in the pr ocess of in-winding, intensifying reac- tive forces develop energies, whose co mbined power is equal to 150 hydro- gen bombs."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"An invincible force of gravity therefore does not exist, and solid, liquid and gaseous masses can actually become almost weightless if they are sim- ply moved in a naturalesque manner, i.e. planetarily. This motion is in no way circular, but must take place in cycloid-spiral space-curves. In this instance a mysterious and precisely measurable negative pressure comes into being, which attracts and draws in so-called atmospheric oxygen with inconceivable force, processes it into nutritive material, and in this way, what Professor Warburg called life-energy evolves. This life-energy immediately subsides if any medium (air, water, earth) is accelerated axially-> radially by means of a drive-shaft. This unnatural form of motion can be described as life-negating or life-energy-destroying. With it all parasites are given carte blanche, for in Creation their function is to demolish all that is no l onger evolutionally viable. With an increase in heat and pressu re, the vacuum or insuctional force is lost. This manifests itself first in the more highly-evolved genital organs and in the brain as tumours. Whatever can no longer breathe, suffocates, and if its immediate environment is abnormally warm it begins to decay. Contemporary science is oblivious to all this, because it knows nothing of the processes and equipment required to move any given medium centripetally or along involuti ng spiral paths. The insuctional force thus created not only draws in higher-gra de elements in trace form, but also generates energies that serve the vital fu nctions. This emulsion also requires the co-action of catalysts. Without these binding energetic influences, no union between the counter-polar etheri cities of the basic elements is possible. Is there a machine with which life-energy can be created or -produced? According to press reports, a university in Calif ornia has been making progress with research into photosynthesis. Thr ough photosynthesis, however, original (form-originating) potential differenc es between the positively-overcharged atmosphere and the negatively-surcharg ed geosphere can be created artifi- cially, thus obviating the use of coal and oil for producing mechanical power. In order to achieve this, oxy gen has to be bound by nitrogen by a cold process, which is to the benefit of the latter. This would result in the artificial production of natural protei n concentrates, which are the principal building-blocks of Nature. Just where would all this lead? It wo uld enable the manufacture of breath- ing machines which rhythmically impregnate and artificially respirate all formative substances created in the pr ocess, and which generate primordial life-energy mechanically. It would also ensure humanity's freedom of move- ment on Earth, on and under water and in the air, for all time. These elementary forces manifest them selves as catastrophes of all kinds, as thunderstorms and deluges, and in the tropics as cyclones and typhoons."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The task of up-and-coming scientists is to harness these forces for the ser- vice of humanity. The example most suited to explaining them is that of the stationary trout in a torr ential mountain stream. Wi thout practical examples and suitable illustrative material it is difficult to describe the vast differ- ences between implosion and explosion. Were it otherwise, then the sense and purpose of breathing could also be e xplained biologically, which makes this negative pressure possible, provided the intermixture of the products of diffu- sion proceeds correctly. In principle Professor Warburg is right wh en he states that it is the lack of oxygen that triggers off reversed meta bolic interaction, whose products of emulsion rupture the cells. However, ev en this scholar, educated according to an old school of thought, overlooks the fact that children go blind and adults succumb to an incurable lung- inflammation, if nitrogen-less oxygen is introduced into the lungs under pressure. It makes a tremendous differ- ence whether this gaseous waste-produc t of solar energy is drawn into the lungs or whether it is pressed into them. This could be compared, for exam- ple, to the difference in tone-quality between a suction- or pressure-driven harmonium. The tone of the latter is hars h, whereas the tone of the former is ethereal (of the spheres). Today's technology has subverted th e eternal river of transmutation (panta rhei) into a river of death, w hose products of emulsion are forms of energy akin to those produced mechan ically by today's nuclear scientists and engineers. In Nature everything is reversible. If a metabolic interaction is triggered off implosivel y, it produces the highest-g rade upsuctional forces (levitation), which alleviate all intellectual torpor and negate all physical weight - as they also do in the case of the stationary trout. The age-old Aryan testament, the Tabula Smaragdina urges: \"Mix the stuff of the Heavens with the stuff of the Earth naturalesquely, then throughout life you will have inde- pendence and happiness.\" This can all be achieved with th e implosion-machine, which unwinds, inwinds and converts excess atmospheric pressure in to a concentrative neg- ative pressure. With these naturalesquely engineered differences in potential it is possible not only to produce driv ing forces for all growth, but also to generate them in properly construc ted, alloyed and insulated machines almost free of cost. With this discovery humanity now stands before a choice: to take leave of a purely phy sical developmental paradigm, which threatens life with increasingly destruct ive forces; or, unconditionally to fall victim to the cancerous scourge of the 20th century.

Written by Viktor Schauberger at Leonstein, July 1945. \"Every movement consists of two compone nts. One component serves inwardness (intensification), the other serves outwardness (dispersion). These two pre-requi- sites alone regulate the eternal river of metamorphosis (panta rhei).\" V.S. - (Implosion Magazine, No.57, p.5) Merely posing the question, is there perp etual motion ? exposes one to the risk of losing the respect of one's fellow men. People have become accustomed to thinking that such a form of motion is impossible. It is raised here in order to examine it in connection with a variety of experiences, which point to the fact that perpetual motion does indeed exist. Not in the sense, how- ever, that science has hitherto considered it, which logically has led to rejec- tion of this often-debated question. Above all we are concerned here with the question, why does Earth rotate about its own axis? The choice of words is actually not quite correct. The term own should be replaced by the word pecu liar, stressing the uniquely particular axis about which Earth rotates. Even th e meaning of the word rotate must be qualified, for the simple reason that everything that turns in circles goes nowhere and makes no headway. There is no change of position, which in the case of the Earth's motion is impossible. It is precisely this making headway that is the purpose of this strangely-m oving Earth. This process of movement could be far better described in terms of a pumping action, through which our hearts are also made to 'beat', so it is said. The movement of blood, however, is not the result of the so-called b eating of the heart - it is the cause. If these fundamentals, which hitherto have been taken for granted, are reversed or inverted, then the scorne d expression perpetual motion takes on a substantially different meaning. My opening question is then no longer absurd, but actually becomes highly inte resting. In this connection other questions come to the fore: what actually is life and how does life come into being? A whole complex of questions th us attains a proper perspective and its final clarification is attempted here. When Galileo discovered that the Ea rth rotated, it sent shock-waves through the secular, religious and scien tific worlds, which resulted in his enforced retraction of this assertion. It is known, however, that before he died, Galileo retracted his retraction, and since then it has become obvious to all that the world rotates about its own axis. So far nobody has made the effort, however, to reflect upon why the world-sphere actually turns. For various reasons even the word sphere con- veniently conceals the function of Earth' s distinctive motion. In two respects the organisation of variously weighted masses within the Earth in no way permit the formation of a true sphere .

All of this has been proven unequivocally by experi- ment. This fact alone demands an eccentric form of motion, which in turn is mir- rored by the asymmetrical shape of the Earth. The form in question is the egg-shape, and more particularly, the 'extreme' egg-shape, which can only be derived from the five-sided symbol of the pentagon (fig. 5). It provides the basic structural framework to deal logi cally and self-evidently with all the peculiarities to be presented. Considering this peculiar type of motion, this peculiar moving body and above all its pe culiar axis, we can ask the ques- tion, why does Earth move in such a singularly distinctive manner? This whole affair is akin to one that led to the most serious errors in the field of scientific experiment. A give n experiment is carried out a thousand times and always produces the same re sult. The reason for this irrefutable result is the repeated use of an iden tical precondition under which the experi- ment is conducted. If this is changed, then obviously a different result is obtained, which may have been neither sought nor desired. In this case there are absolutely no gro unds to be able to speak of a regularity, but rather of a fluctuating conformity with natura l law. This is understandable, because the extremely crucial influences of li ght and temperature, and indeed all other types of influence, are constantly changing. In Nature therefore, the preconditions for such expe riments are totally absent , whereas in a labora- tory in which specific preconditions can be artificially arranged, this or another experiment may be successful. From this point of view, any such experiment is misleading, as is Archimedes' Law of Displacement. If wa ter is moved naturalesquely (in the way that healthy water has to move, analogous to the form of Earth motion above) before Archimedes' specific-weig ht determining experiment is car- ried out, then its specific weight cha nges so markedly that the laws govern- ing the definition of specific and absolute weight are thrown to the four winds. In this case ores, which woul d normally sink to the bottom at once, actually float in the central core-water of a river. Even more amazing is the behaviour of heavy stones in still wa ter, which under particular conditions of temperature no longer obey the law of absolute gravity and rise to the surface. However, this only happens if the water has previously been moved according to this natural (pecu liar) pattern of movement. All of which means, no more and no less, that the law of gravity exists only under certain preconditions. If we continue further in this direction, always mindful of the question of preconditions, then through the particular form of motion described in gen- eral terms above, the law of gravity can be eliminated. A completely new law"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"of levitation becomes operative. This throws the whole of science and tech- nology overboard, because up to now th ese two fields of human endeavour only knew and applied the law of gravity. Gravitation, however, is only a secondary effect of this principal force. Were there no levitation, then gravita tion could never exist, because in the final analysis everything would remain flat on the ground. By using this levitational force, the energy to power machines will be virtually free and therefore of little worth by today's ethical standards. From an environmental point of view this makes good sense, because it serves the will of Nature and furthers evolution. In contrast, present systems of ener- gy-generation using the forces of grav ity and pressure are environmentally dangerous, and the more they are exploited the more hazardous the dangers. Having said all this, however, we are still just at the beginning of the introductory description of this peculiar form of motion. We are also at the initial phase of the question, Why does the Earth move itself? In answering these questions we inevitably get closer to the resolution of the question, Is there perpetual motion? Certainly there is, but in a completely different sense to the one that has so far persuaded science to dismiss the matter a priori, because at the very outset nobody should concern themselves with such nonsensical things. All of this, despite the accepted fact that, in ecological consequence of the above 'peculiar' fo rm of motion, the whole Earth floats in free space without an axis and hence without friction. This is due to its movement along a cycloid-spiral space-curve. This singularly unusual axis of the Earth is therefore no axis at all in the accepted sense, but an infinitely sma ll hollow space or, more accurately, a concatenation of an immense number of hollow spaces akin to pores. In these spaces not only are the products of levitation to be found, which come into being through this curious motion, but also gravitati onal products aris- ing from the planetary counter-motion of the Sun. When viewed from the same vantage point these two forces rotate in mutually-reversed order with- in and without this remarkable evolu tionary form (Earth). Even the words 'reversed order' are not quite correct, because the end-effect results in their moving in opposite directions (upwar ds or downwards, inwards or out- wards) owing to their mutually-inverted direction of rotation. Apart from these differences account must be taken of differences between active and reactive forms of temperature, of the different directions taken by the actively-reactively functioni ng products of temperature, and also, the various types and directions of light (which again produce various dif- ferences in potential). The outcome of the deliberations highlighted here will be of such diverse nature that we stand before an entirely new world. Contemporary ways of looking at thi ngs thus become totally unworthy of"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"consideration. The ramifications are of such a staggering nature that we have to start again at the very beginning in order to arrive, in roundabout ways, at the point where life is once more worth living. It is in this sense that what follows should be considered. However, this is not so simple because bipolarities have to be considered. On closer inspection we must also ta ke reactions into account, so that we must speak of a tri-polarity. Then we can differenti ate between the products of spacial organisation and those which in effect do not manifest themselves as pure bipolarities, alt hough they are the cause of this regenerative and upwardly-evoluting form of motion. The end-products of this phenomenon are specifically-densified forms of the structures of raw and refined matter, which rhythmically reinforce and ra ise each other up and qualitatively enhance each other. New in teractions take place, re sulting in an eternal, unceasing motion. This leads to the realisation that there would be absolute- ly no life or movement were there no perpetual motion in Nature. It is difficult to find words to describe this 'peculiar' evolutionary produc- tion line upon which the quadratures of this 'original' metabolic process arise, and the cubatures of the raw materials take form . These should be visualised as looping skeins of endlessn ess akin to the mathematical sign for infinity - oo.They rotate about and along the longitudinal axis in such a remarkable way that the centre of gr avity of a through-flowing mass is so guided along the axis that the 'disap pearing' encounters the 'returning'. They become so entangled with each ot her in the process that the disap- pearing entwines (binds) the returning, or vice versa. In the first case a process of specific densation and an autonomous upsurge or upward impulse takes place, which happen s with all good mountain springwater. The opposite case results in a process of increasing absolute density in a gravitating fall a nd repulsive recoil. It is upon these differences that the ge nders of various entities or forma- tions depend. For this reason, whatever has been created in this way has to interact continually. Through the agen cy of a special impulse-and-repulse generating motion, the crude material cannot disappear, but by being moved implosively it is continually reborn in the production of refined mat- ter (ethericities). Owing to its polarity it must also interact, thus initiating a new motive impulse. One could become quite demented if one reflects not only upon this eternal, dynamic process, but also upon the resulting prod- ucts of motion! This would be the case if a certain limit were exceeded. The ultimate manifestations in ethereal and spiritua l realms can no longer be contemplated because one has to keep one's feet on the ground. In this 'peculiar' axis, which can be perceived with the naked eye as the tube-like structure that forms when water flows down a drain, the source of levitative matter is to be found. In this same axis the trout is able to over-"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"come a 10 m high waterfall without effort. He who understands how to cul- tivate this levitating force by mechanical means can create 'perpetual motion', because in their bipolar interaction the levitating and gravitating forces produce a repulsive, uplifting motion. The same bipolarity also operates in the realm of the mind, wherein intu- ition is to be found in the upper region s and logic in the lower. Similar differ- ences exist between the conscious a nd unconscious mind, which in most people has become so atrophied through one-sided education that the gift of intuition is now limited to a very few. Whatever we create using our free, over-developed, intellectual capacity is mostly upside down. Logical thought is only the initial phase or the prerequisite for biological action. For this reason it is also u nderstandable why secular a nd religious leaders were so rudely shaken when Galileo first mooted his extremely ticklish question. At about the same time Leonardo da Vinci began his search for il primo motore, which eternally moves our Mo ther-Earth about her special axis. Nothing could have been simpler or mo re obvious than to copy this 'pecu- liar' motion of Nature's faithfully in Repulsators and Repulsines. The logical outcome of these unique experiments th en produced the naturalesque pre- conditions, which enable the generation of energy for machines, as well as all the energies for growth of whatever kind, at virtually no cost.

All manner of observations and investigatio ns of many years standing led to the realisation, however, that the arous al of the secular and religious leaders was not without foundation."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The revolution of the Earth about its own axis is really an oscillation of an egg-shaped, internally variably-weigh ted, hollow form, above which arches the horizon. This motion of the Earth is the ur-cause of radiation or radi- ance, the emergence of that we call 'life'. Through an oscillation along two different axes, a concentration arises out of a bacteriophagic nebula. At the common focal point of these two axes, this concentration then produces a life-quickening expansion. 79 Due to this centrifugal gyration, anal ogous to a spinning top, two mutual- ly opposed dynamic components come in to being, (see fig. 6a) 1) A centripetal striving to centre itself along its longitudinal axis. 2) A figure-of-eight shaped horizontal motion (viewed in transverse cross- section - see fig. 6b), which due to the unequal weight distribution, either reduces its wobble with increasing rate of rotation, or increases it with a reducing number of rotations. fig. 6a - Longitudinal View fig. 6b - Transverse View Fig. 6 The energetic interaction of centripetal and centrifugal forces, (see also fig. 7) If the number of revolutions rises, then the self-generated oscillation arising from the horizontally looping motion c ontracts, resulting in the automatic reduction in the rate of rotation.

These looping movements are both mutually antagonistic and mutually complementary, and culminate in the creation of a 'labile' unstable state of equilibrium, a state of floating, whose inner fulcrum is the focal point men- tioned above. At this point the concen trating and expanding forces intersect, which, acting in all directions, produce the 'labile' point of balance in which two symmetrically and proportionally re ciprocal basic el ementary states alternately consume or bind each ot her. This unleashes the life-giving motion, which oscillates radially in all directions and once more binds the products of expansion in the same focal point or point of concentration thus brought into being. This process of motion, however, is only possible in an extreme egg-shape derived from the pentagram. This is isolated in such a way that from inside outwards and outside inwards, an in teraction between potentiated bipolar expansive and concentrative substanc es is possible. Dispersed partly mechanically and partly by reactive temperature forms, these enter and exit through reciprocally disposed pore-ope nings equipped with bipolar diffu- sion coils. These generate the influen ces that underlie the inward and out- ward falls mentioned above. If one takes into account the contrasti ng nature of the substances of the Earth and the Heavens, some of which react to centrifugen ce and others to centripetence, then there arises a constant mixi ng of both opposing forma- tive basic elements. This produces a rhythmical, irregular combination of both oppositely orientated stocks of ba sic elements, and a regular distur- bance of the bi-axial state of equilibrium, resulting in an infinite curve where in practical terms th ere is no longer any state of rest. This infinite motion is the 'cycloid-spiral space-curve motion', the secret of 'Eternal Life' through 'Eternal Motion'. And vice versa, eternal motion through eternal life. In this concentrated form of representation, it is impossible to compre- hend the expansive action of this sp ecific ur-cause-concentration and for this reason one must go to very great lengths in order to describe the focal point of this unique ex-pansive concentrative motion.

The thinner the shaft the less the driving force required, i.e. with the thinnest shaft only minimal boring pressure is possible. The slightest overloading causes the drill-bit to break. Through this observation I have become aware of a hitherto unknown source of energy, which could fundame ntally change current technology. Instead of transferring power directly, it is possible to exploit reactive forces obtained by indirect means. If air or water is centrifuged 81 in a naturalesquely constructed egg-form, then only a portion the material conglom erates or reacts to the horizontal centrifugence. This is because these organisms (air and water) have been endowed with catalytically active character through the addition of bipolar minerals, and catalysatorically active character through the incorporation and arrangement of bipola r wall-surfaces. That is to say, only the carbones and hydrogen are conducted to the positi on of greatest radius. There, with rising pressure due to increasing rate of rotation, they are forced against the rotating inner wall of the wobb ling egg-form (see fig. 8b). The 'higher' waste matter, so-called oxygen, separates out and accumu- lates about the longitudinal axis of the egg-form, the latter rotating about its own axis. The higher the rpm, the smal ler the cross-sectional area of the oxygen core ranged around the longitudina l axis (shown at * in fig. 8c). Now an intermed iate phenomenon: Through the increased rpm-induced rise in pressure, a potential or charge develops at the position of greatest horizontal radius. After a certain critical minimum pressure has been exceeded, th is gives way to a depotentiation or discharge, which results in the relapse of the water previously raised through centrifugence (see fig. 8d). As a counter-effect, the release of an ampere-less energy-form can be observed, which transpierces the wall at the position of largest horizontal radius, a nd flows away in a wavi-linear man- ner (fig. 8d). After a short period the de-energised and thus previously relapsed water rises once again to the point of maximu m radius (see fig. 8e). Immediately after the water has subsided, the rate of rotation rises. When the relapsed water again rises at the location of maximum horizontal radius, then an exponentially increased pressure is ex erted on the wall-sur face. As a result the partially de-energised water can once more release energies, which again transpierce the walls at the point of maximum horizontal radius. Whereupon the newly de-energised water on ce again sinks. At this instant, the rate of rotation again increases, whereby the lateral pressure again rises exponentially, and so on. 81 A handwritten note by Viktor Schauberger states that the effect occurs at 32,000rpm. - Kurt Lorek"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The 'higher' waste matter, the oxygen executes a rhythmically ordered interplay and every time the water sinks, the oxygen converges further towards the longitudinal axis, redu cing the cross-section of the oxygen core in the process (see fig. 8f). In other words, every de-energising of the carbones and hydrogen on the horizontal axis (plane) results in the charging (potentiation) of the longitudinally-centred oxygen core. That is to say, with every lateral depotentiation, the oxygen core is extended longitu- dinally (vertically), its tip developing towards the top of the longitudinal axis. The higher the rpm rises in consequence of the rhythmical depotentiaton of the carbones and hydrogen (at wh ich time the ammeter indicating the amount of current falls), the more el ongated the self-centring oxygen core becomes, due to the heightened rpm. This centrally disposed, increasingly slimmer and longer egg-form is the 5th egg-form (see figs. 8c & 8g), which is formed within a 2nd, 3rd and 4th egg, each of which encloses and sur- rounds a more highly cultured substance. Through processes of atomic fis- sion, therefore, five zones are created, the point of the innermost of which also points towards the narrow end of the outermost egg-form. When the maximal velocity of the rotating outer egg-form is exceeded, ions stream out of the tip of the innermost egg. These are emitted in pulsations and are shot into space at extremely high velocities. If these ions, which with concentric compactness rotate about their own axis, encounter a twisted conductor (see fig. 8h), then this pure kinetic ener- gy is transformed into heat and cons umed in the process. This heat-form, however, has a contracting force and sinks, in contrast to the familiar diffus- ing heat-form, which rises. The first heat -form, however, is important for the formation and ordering of growth although this is only incidental. If these ion-discharges are conducted to th e exterior via the points of suit- able cones, we are presented with a kind of ion-cannon (see fig. 8i). With this the radius of action and the veloc ity of the emitted ions can be regulat- ed at will by increasing the rotational ve locity of the egg as it rotates about its own axis. When an emitted ion en counters a substance floating in space at high altitudes the substance will be heated up, de-energised or dis- charged in the process and disintegrate d. With every ion-emission, there- fore, the particles (micro-spaces) floating in space will be reduced in size. These substances will be bombarded until even the original micro-space becomes space-less or reverts to a pure energy-form. Since this energy-form carries an oppos ite charge relative to the emitted ion, any following ion carrying a positive charge will be attracted to the negatively-charged products of disint egration, due to its opposite polarity. In this way the original force of em ission will be inte nsified through ele- mentary forces of attraction."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Further conclusions will not be addressed here, since these rightly belong to the processes of formation itself. These provide the impetus and basis for growth in the form of counter-ions, which come into being through the reversion of the highest energy-products. Growth must therefore be consid- ered from a substantially different point of view than it is today. Vertical winds, cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes, waterspouts and so on could be viewed as natural examples of this, which is why the Repulsator is an ideal pump. The Repulsator, for example, can suck in seawater, atomise and draw it upwards. The water's cont ent of oxygen also does not react to centrifugence, but operati ng in the opposite sense, shapes the movement on the longitudinal axis, its end-product is actually the positive ion. For this reason the remaining water centrifuged out through the waviform is sweet (fresh) (see patent example). That the formation of the Gulf Stream and the movement of sea and air currents can also be explained in this wa y, is self-evident. In this way too, and for the first time, the ur-formation of the Earth, the ur-creation of water and other zone-groups, the ur-creation of the bio-anode of the Moon and naturally the ur-formation of the bi o-cathode of the Sun, becomes under- standable. The secret lies hidden in the 'own' axis, which comes into being through the atomic fission and centring of the oxygen core and the dynamic motion of a naturalesquely constructed egg-form.

From Implosion Magazine, No.22 Today's technically-minde d people have already di vorced themselves so thoroughly from Nature that they are simply incapable of understanding such terms as organic syntheses and plasmolytic forces. 82 For this reason the following elaborations are necessary as data for later practical demonstrations, otherwise nobody would be able to unde rstand how to build the necessary devices and equipment. The same situation would then arise as has occurred with contemporary methods of generating electricity, already carried out on a large scale without anyone knowing what the concept 'electrici ty' really means. Because of this no-one is aw are of the ultimate after-effect s of this force, which in resistance creates heat and in this energetic form conduc es decomposition. We have therefore set out on a journey whose end and final outcome we cannot know. In contrast to degenerative, decomposive 'electricity', bioelectricity generates fresh, renewed life - growth. We are th erefore concerned with extreme differ- ences and with equipment and applia nces which transform the organ it- remains of life into a 'biocurrent'. It is a process akin to the way that plant- fruits, grapes, a tart apple, or a cancer ously acidic perry-pear can be trans- formed into spirit (alcohol). This ar ises through the varying temperatures active in a process of fermentation. The reorganisation and higher synthesis of the residues of human, animal and vegetable life depend on causes 82 'Plasmolytic': Collins English Dictionary describe s 'plasmolysis' as \"the shrinkage of a protoplasm away from the cell walls that occurs as a result of excessive water loss, esp. in plants cells.\" The implica- tion here in Viktor Schauberger's use of it, is that it refers to a form of motion that withdraws or elongates the moved medium (earth, air or water) from contact with the conducting wall-surfaces. This reduces all resistance-, friction- and heat-produc ing processes to a minimum. In addition it also withdraws the medi- um into itself, thus concentrating its molecules into a an increasingly smaller volume. This internalising process also extends to the withdrawal of the energies themselves from the walls, as it were, of the confin- ing molecules, leading to their implosion, a reversion to an atomic state and a super-concentration of pure energy. The end-result of this is the 'biological vacuum' and the phenomenon that Viktor Schau- berger referred to as the 'compressi on of dematerialisation'. Instead of being a void in the usual sense of the word, the biological vacuum is actually a supero rdinate state of extraordinarily high potency.- Ed. 153"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"opposite to those that trigger such high-grade decomposive processes. Expres- sed more accurately, they depend on me taphysical processes of further devel- opment. These are inexplicable in terms of present concepts and outlook. Broadly speaking, what needs to be ad dressed here is a practical, imple- mentable process of atomic transformation (not fission) with the aid of life- current or biocurrent-generating biomot ors. With these growth can not only be increased at will, but a wide variety of machines and motive power can also be produced for virtually nothing. In this new world shortages of food will be a thing of the terrible and gris ly past. Energy will be free and there- fore of no commercially exploitable value. Today this train of thought would appear Utopian. All the more so, because it is exceedingly difficult to differentiate contemporary concepts from those required here, for which ther e are no technical terms. Therefore modern (and frequently inappropriate) terminology will have to be used. By placing them between quotation marks a different sense or meaning is intended. This I can do nothing about. Later on, other and fresh words will have to be coined to describe these new concepts. The False World View In every larger settlement there is a church and next to it a school. In the school the teacher works and prepares the rising generation for their profes- sional and adult life. This rising generation is evolutionally older - they enter evolution at a later date. Since the concept of a higher evolvement of quality (qualigen) is foreign to the teacher, he carries out his duties unnaruralesquely and therefore incorrectly. In the house of God works the vicar. To a greater or lesser extent he prepares the evolutionally younger - the older generation - for death, that sublime process of tran sformation. He too does this unnarura- lesquely and equally wrongly. Both teacher and priest are servants of a large- scale operation which can only exist as long as a shortage of food and spiritual and mental torpor prevail. All of which are prerequisites for a traffic in body and soul. The reason that the subtlety of this abysmal iniquity is so hard to apprehend is because at school and in church the human factory-fod- der are told that this state of affairs has been ordained by God. Neither of these two, the teacher just as little as the spiritual guide, are able to explain the sense and purpose of existence and the formation of the body. Both stolidly adhere to the decrees of Old and New Testaments and believe, God only knows how, that they have thereby fulfilled their ritual obligations. For this reason it is high time that th e meaning and purpose of life should be explained plainly and clearly. After a pe rson's life-energies (which gave them a sense of direction, a right-side-upness and enabled them to overcome gravi-"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"ty) have been extinguished, it is worth considering how such a lump of human flesh is transformed into spirit. This is analogous to the conversion of a crab-apple or a perry-pear into alc ohol. In other words: how, after its demise, is subjective intellectuality (o r the subordinate mental functions) of the body returning to the Earth recons tituted and developed into metaphysi- cal products of fermentation with the aid of the Earth's cycloid motion? The first thing that comes into bei ng in this process is the so-called ground-climate. In other words, the geospheric frequency or soil-potential from which atmospheric frequency or mountain climate subsequently evolves. In these two metaphysical, and therefore more highly energetic intermediate zones of development, a dynamic, equilibrating activity takes place, which here will be referred to as the 'plasmolytic interaction of pres- sure and suction elements'. This inte ractive activity, which continuously triggers off processes in which crude and quality matter are reconstituted and built up, will be described in more detail later on. More importantly, however, this interaction between threshold-magni- tudes 83 can actually be copied with th e use of specially-shaped devices. These function according to natural princi ples and at the same time ensure the almost totally controllable replen ishment of foodstuffs. Moreover, the interaction also provides an almost-free source of power, thereby making this purely creative work a delight instead of a duty. This has little or nothing to do with a discussion of natural philosophy, but with the examination of viable and practical possibilities for regulating the processes of growth, for re storing almost totally inde pendent livelihoods, and for manufacturing biomachines. These biomachin es provide the basis for generat- ing near cost-free power and for producing almost total freedom of movement - the ability to travel over land, in the air and on or under water. In addition it con- cerns the designs of stable, reliable machines for generating a certain form of elec- tricity. It should also be mentioned in passing that almost any desired increase and qualitative improvement of metals can also be achieved in this way. In all seriousness this concerns the regulation of everything we see around us or are otherwise aware of. It concerns the universal promotion of growth and the faithful copying of all the products of growth that humanity requires for com- fort and the maintenance of life, each according to their individual needs. At first sight this may all seem pure fantasy or the product of a warped mind. How- ever, it will be seen to be just as dow n-to-earth and realis tic as it now appears fantastic, once the physical and metaphysi cal processes involved have been elu- cidated and understood. People whose reaso ning is deductive will always have difficulty in comprehension, becaus e every dynamic, metaphysical phenome- non (in this case thoughts) leaves a phy sical imprint of its developmental 83 'Threshold magnitudes': Substances at the ex treme limit of matter, or quasi-immaterial substances at the inter-etheric boundary between matter and pure energy. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"pathway, and therefore the convolutions of their brains become deformed. For the same reason even a healthy thinker will often be thrown off course and so the infinite extent and wave-like form of hi s thought cannot reach its ultimate conclusion. The thought then becomes o ffensive, is rejected and as a result becomes solidified and laid out cold th rough the nascent development of heat. Growth and Seed Production as the Natural Goal of Evolution Every movement has its beginning and its goal. The goal in turn is the begin- ning of an end without end. A movement without a goal is senseless. Were there no new beginning once this goal was reached, however, death and solidi- fication would result. This is especiall y applicable to understanding 'plas- molytic motion', which is a prerequisite if we are to define 'growth'. To put it briefly, growth is the product of solidifi ed, energetic qualigen with insufficient intrinsic potential. It is no longer able to co-act in higher levels of re-combina- tion and formation, and solidifies unde r the influence of light and the Sun's heat. Just as warmed-up by-p roducts of thinking calcify , so too does the quali- gen, formerly in an energetic state, solidify into products of growth. Naturopaths call the path of evolution th e spiral of life, which is referred to here as the 'cycloid, space-curve!'. In this cycloidal life-evolving path, pressure and suction forces develop similar to those that we know of in sexual responses. In its forward thrust, dynagen projects essences with an intrinsic spacial and potential vacuity ahead of it, like rockets. This makes it look as though the fluid seminal matter is expelled, whereas it is actually sucked in. What actually hap- pens is that in its invisible, forward surge, the dynagen loses high-grade, spa- tially vacuous and potential-deficient essen ces in the process. It ejects ballast as it were, in order to increase its own speed and penetrating power. It is this ener- gy and movement that forms and buil ds up the blood. The only difference is that instead of a straight advance, here we are concerned with a rotary biocur- rent, which gyrates about its own axis. Du e to the accretion of these completely solidified, deficient essences on the in ner wall-surfaces of blood vessels the same kind of double-spiral motion evolves that we are still able to see in natur- al, undisturbed streams and rivers. If such conducting vessels are copied natu- ralesquely, then any water flowing through them will become cool, fresh, dynamic and free of gas. A highly potent concentration of energy comes into being. If liquid or gaseous organisms (water or air) are swirled cycloidally in a high-speed centripulser, 84 the ensuing build-up of dynagen or qualigen 84 'Centripulser': Is a rotating device producing the sequential compaction (pressure) and rarefaction (suction) of the medium in question (air or wate r).

'Liken to its naturale sque conclusion, this concept would result in the design of an ideal aircraft that readily ascends with hardly any fuel, or an ideal submarine which is lifted by the keel (by the seat of i t s pants) and dives just as easily. All this with hardly any propellent, because this system of motion works not under duress, but with desire. The 'plasmolytic force' is triggere d by an orbital outward-and-inward movement which originates at the pe riphery and acts along the longitudinal axis. It is therefore a question of spacial forces, because they permeate and fill the whole space. The product is bo rn out of a screw-form motion in which pressure and suction evol ve and operate on a common axis. 'Plasmolytic' motion is a seed-produc ing motion and springs forth from a highly excited protoplasm. In this pro cess the physical production of seed is initiated through a longitudinal (up-and- down) stimulating motion, where- as a transverse, stimul ating motion is active pr oducing a metaphysical out- birth of energy. In this respect the type of motion originating from the material axis and the explosive force acting from the inside outwards are disintegrative and destructive. On th e other hand the force acting from the outside inwards is creative and life-promoting. Formative and Destructive Syntheses The enormous difference between te chnology and ecotechnology will now be explained for the first time. Technol ogy initiates motive impulses that destroy the substances required fo r growth and development. Eco- technology on the other hand, triggers a concentration of growth-enhancing substances. In other words, today's technology, physics, chemistry, etc., gen- erate impulses that create products harm ful to reproduction, regeneration and growth. Ecotechnology, ecophysi cs and ecochemistry generate impulses that create products benefici al to growth and reproduction. Both technologist and ecotechnologist trigger only the energising impulse itself. They merely provide the impetus for the development of one effect or another. The technologist gives a heatin g impulse, the ecotechnologist a cooling impulse. The ecotechnologist is constr uctive; he provides for the uplifting advancement of evolution and developm ent. The technologist, however, gives the very stuff of evolution a kick, which sends it reeling uncontrollably back- wards and down to the very lowest level of evolution. 85 The technologist, chemist and physicist are therefore destroyers of evolution and the ecotechnologist, eco- physicist and ecochemist are the promoter s of evolution. The ecotechnologist 85 Fire produces ashes, which are no longer organic. While still possessed of a small spark of life, ashes are inorganic basic elements, which have to be built up into organic structures again from scratch. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"can achieve economic growth almost free of capital input, whereas the technol- ogist produces an inexorable decline, an economic catastrophe, at great expense. A high-grade synthesis takes place when geosperic ethericities, which are free, highly stimulated, uni-polar fructigenic elements (t he chemist classifies these as belonging to the carbon group), consume or bind inward, c ounter-falling (gravitating) seminal sub- stances (principally oxygen). This results in the formation of a negatively-charged ground-climate, which is a high-frequenc y, horizontally-propagating potential. It is the true foundation for the build-up of evolution-enhancing growth prod- ucts and is known as the seed or germinal zone. It is an interstitial zone of development lying between the positively-charged atmosphere and the nega- tively-charged geosphere, and encompasses the whole depth of the root-zone. The germinal zone can be so enriched mechanically that growth and forma- tion automatically take place as if on a conv eyor belt. All that is needed is the smallest impulse in order to prod uce a boundless profusion of reproductive and upwardly-evolving out-births. Contemporary technologists, physicists and chemists do precisely the opposite. With an enormous expenditure on wasteful preparation, space and mate rial (petrol refineries, fo r example), they inaugurate impulses leading to reversed syntheses. Here the seminal substances bind or consume the true formative substances, the fructigens (oxidation is the combus- tion by seminal oxygen of fructigens, such as carbones in the form of petrol, oil). With water, for example, every rise in temperature reduces its quality and condition, because the wrong form of oxidation is activated. In regulated water- ways, most of which lack protective bank vegetation, millions of valuable ener- gies are lost, which ought to be employed in building up the vegetation. The technologist is thus a parasite or the Devil who destroys Creation. The ecotechnologist on the other hand , furthers the will of Creation. Through his or her activities all shortage s in the necessities of life and all drudgery unworthy of human beings w ill cease almost instantly. Everyone will become independent and free, and will have the time to devote them- selves exclusively to the environmenta l activity that corresponds to their natural abilities and particular interest. In this fashion every more or less talented person will become an artist in their own particular field of endeav- our and through the general improvement in everything they produce, the general standard of living will also rise. Matter and the movement of qualigen arising from it will be under the full control of future human beings, who will become the highest servants and at the same time the masters of Nature. 86 Fabulous harvests will provide them with the highest quality food and at the same time they will enjoy the almost abso- lute freedom of movement on land, in water and in the air, in recognition of the services they have rendered Creation and therefore God. With this, all struggle 86 \"We cannot command Nature except by obe ying her.\" Sir Francis Bacon. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"for survival, for social equa lity, and for existence itself, indeed all wars over food and raw materials will automatically come to an end. By activating the right impulse, peace will be assured throughout th e world, because no-one will need to take bread away from another. Whoever helps another is never his enemy. The fundamental error of technology lies in its exploitation of the direct action of pressure and suction, which function axially->radially, centrifugally from inside outwards. Wise Nature on the other hand employs exactly the opposite motive forces, which always operate radially->axially, centripetally from outside inwards. By inaugurating the latter motion any heating and cooling effect can be produced and therefore living spaces heated or cooled naturally. People will be able to raise or lower water at will and all contemporary machines of whatever description and for whatever purpose w ill disappear without trace. The next generation will already be able to look back in horror at the age when the evolu- tionally younger (their parents and grandpa rents) made use of mechanical mon- strosities that engulfed the whole world in unease, anxiety, trouble and worry. Even the medical profession will have to change fundamen tally. What Para- celsus foresaw will become reality: \"One day there will be a specific, which will suf- focate every germ of disease at its incepti on. Humanity will know no sickness and will therefore become full of the joys of life.\" Space and land will be available in suffi- cient measure to those who through their very existence will enable the build- up of raw materials throughout the whole evolutionary chain to occur. Deserts will be made to bloom again. Where milk and honey once flowed, we humans created wastelands through our senseless greed, whence all water fled. As the source of life it could neither reproduce, re generate or upwardly evolve itself, nor could it increase and improve in quality. As a result it developed into the most dangerous legacy of human endeavour. The fields became barren and the nobl- est high-forest, the natural donor of fresh blood, slowly, but surely began to die. False and Faulty Management Today's engineers, physicists, chemists and exponents of science had a bad education and were inculcated with the axioms, princi ples and dogmas of speculative thinkers and intuitionless individuals. They have all become servants of a decomposing and analysing principle, the principle of dissolu- tion. They were forced to try first one thing and then another with a groping millimetre by millimetre strategy; they made no advance worthy of the name, but only went backwards. Because of their direct approach, the sever- est harm to the environment was inevitable. Wise Nature takes the very opposite road. Her evolutionary path s and processes are always indirect. This perception alone is enough to bring the mundane edifice of science crashing down. Religious instruction was no less of a hazard, because it"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"perverted or perhaps even intentiona lly concealed the real reason for the creation of the body. Technology is derived from ancient Gr eek prefix techno, which, amongst other things, can be translated as se lf-delusion or self-deception. Nothing further need be said! What now follows is therefore only a pointer as to how things could be done more naturalesquely. This is how one day they will have to be done if the present situation is ever to be redeemed and reversed. Once it becomes clear to all humanity that they are victims of the present situation, then the whole charade will be over. The Mechanical Equivalent of Heat One of the most dangerous fa llacies, if not actually an intentional deception, is the Law of Conservation of Energy and the Law of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat propounded by a certain Robert Mayer. The build-up of heat always takes place at the expense of vitality a nd heat can only reach excessive levels if retroactive syntheses occur, or when fo r any reason the seminal matter, oxygen, becomes free, uni-polar and thereby aggr essive. On the other hand, heat makes fructigens (carbones) inactive and more easily bound. Every increase in heat occurs at the expense of the development of life. In order to heat up l m 3 of water by 0.1 °C an input of energy equal to 42,700 kilogram-metres (kgm) is required. From this it can perhaps be a ppreciated just how much energy is lost if it is not bound in processes of organic synthesis. Wherever the force of levitation is miss ing, then the force of gravity domi- nates. Where gravity alone prevails, th en the momentum is also absent to which the naturalesque impulse or mech anical movement gives rise. In this respect, the force of gravity is only necessary and interesting for initiating the formation of the developmentally-important form of energy. The main- tenance of the impulse therefore signif ies the maintenance of formative life- force, for which the presence of a safety valve, the 'brake', is imperative. For this reason excessive heat represents Nature's will to eliminate, to which everything falls victim that is diseased or has become unusable for further evolution. The best symbol of this process is Hell, where sinning souls, those unfit for life, are allegedly condemned to burn for eternity. The fate of life itself is a question of the way it evolves. This in turn depends on how the two types of synthesis are organised, both of which can be regulated through cycloid motion once the given medium has been dosed with the appropriate elements and ingredients. It therefore lies in humanity's power to produce the desired impulse. In this way the forma- tion and decomposition of blood can be so ordered that (a) only the latency is actuated, suited to processes of hi gher transformation and growth, or (b)"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"whatever is inappropriate for the cultivab le path of evolution, for one rea- son or another, is made to repeat the whole process from the beginning. Knowledge and Science Western philosophy doubtlessly obtai ned its most powerful impetus from physics which, although founded on basic truths, only supported itself on effects, never on causes. With causes faits can be accomplis, once the process of growth and transformation is know n through which physical actualities are created. The reason why these cannot arise naturalesquely today is due to the use of the wrong physical (mecha nical) motion. Goethe was severely critical of science because it disregar ded the inner essence, the philosopher's stone, as it were, of the thing itse lf around which everything revolves. To which Goethe commented, \"By this one may recognise a man of learning, for what he cannot touch lies miles beyond his understanding\". This inner nucleus can be developed in one way or anothe r according to the type and direction of rotation. All genius springs from an artistic fantasy, whereas a moribund fantasy allows no creative pennies to drop. An impulse is energy in statu nascendi. It can serve either integration (growth) or disintegration (decay). Cause and effect are the result of cycloid space-curve motion from which life or death springs forth. The skill merely resides in the organisation of the rhythm of both types of synthesis. Both must alwa ys be active and at all times present, and must make use of what is useful and harm what is harmful. Fantasy therefore is the unleashing of a fantastic impulse. Naturally it would take more than one blow to fell the tree of unnatura- lesque knowledge because it is so rooted in all branches of industry. Amidst the ensuing turmoil therefore, the difference between chalk and cheese would be hard to distinguish. The pres ent order would also be upset in one fell swoop if its underpinning financial ma rkets were dealt with carelessly Should no suitable precautions be taken in this area then the whole financial and commercial applecart would be thro wn into total disarray and a chaos of unimaginable proportions would ensue. The last war [WW2] was a good teacher an d led to the realisation, so aptly expressed by Goethe, \"Now here I stand, a fool so poor, and just as clever as before\" The war and the post-war period have enabled the after-effects of a dead sci- ence to be experienced so quickly that causes and effects can be perceived by a single generation. Previously it was only la ter generations who began to feel the effects of science's misguided activity , but they could no t discern the causes. Ultimately science and the war provided the motivation to investigate causes, because the people themselves experienced the effects in quick succession."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Naturalesque Activity The modus operandi arising from the activa tion of 'plasmolytic essences' of pres- sure and suction will sweep away (or suck in its wake) all those whose minds were too stolid or too stupid to realise th at what benefits one benefits another.

It is equally necessary that the 'stronger' male sex be made aware of its own weaknesses and thereby become more careful. We should not blindly believe everything and allow ourselves to be governed by laws that do not exist, for all that prevails in this evolutionary happening is rhythm. This rhythm strengthens whatever lives natura lesquely and moves itself in such a way that apart from its muscular stre ngth, the power of its mind also grows through mental exercise. Spiritual sport is just as important as physical sport, the former being understood as a life-aff irming activity, whose principal function is to foster the care of that fount of qualigen, the physically first-born - water. This source of qualigen, so vital to the survival of all fields of human endeavour, cannot be explained scientifically. It defies all description, because so much is happening or has already happened in this colourless, tasteless, odourless and formless water that, quite literally, all that is needed is just a small impulse to initiate something good, bad or indifferent. The fact that no major catastrophe has so fa r happened is due to the sensitivity of key threshold-elements contained in all water. These critical threshold- elements are in a state of equilibriu m. They can move neither forwards no backwards. As intermediary bacter iophagous essences they stand between life and death. It is due to this neutral condition that anything has been able to continue to grow at all. Even ex act science was unable to poke its nose in everywhere, and wise Nature has been able to outwit its own experts. Since patents applications have been made, which definitively clarify the internal processes in water and air, no fu rther details can be given here. Due to this patent-related impediment, however , the problem of naturalesque methods of working will solve itself. Everybody will research in depth out of primal self- interest. Digging deeply, they will become composters instead of impostors, thus bringing every ecclesiastical potenta te and all intrigue to a sudden end. Goethe as Biologist It is difficult for an engineer, a physicist or a chemist to construe the poetry of Faust and Goethe's observations of Nature as the best form of biology. However, if the purpose of life is deemed to consist of making a small piece of this Earth productive, then the bio-ecol ogical compass of this German poet-"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"prince's persuasive intuition will be perfectly underst ood. To make a small plot of ground fertile in effect means nothing more than to set a very small and in- significant threshold element in motion, which possesses just enough intrinsic potential to overcome i t s own body-weight, but not enough to levitate. All that it lacks, therefore, is the living spark in order to trigger its practical cultivation. Cycloid motion, through which plasmo lytic, germinal entities come into being, is all that is required to ma ke it practically possible. These immedi- ately distribute themselves vertically and increase the quantity of the next higher product of evolution and qualitatively improve it. A forest of new trees of knowledge springs up from this realisation, of which only two will be addressed briefly here. These two trees of knowledge will suffice to uproot today's science and technology. If the following chapter does not jolt them out of their complacency, then nothing will. The Creation of Impulsion and Expulsion through Cycloid Motion It is common knowledge that all life comes into being through move- ment. Since everything is bipolar in nature, there are also two different types of motion. One of these leads direct ly to heaven and the other to hell. Between them lies a biological state of utter indifference, a purifying purga- tory, a labile state of equilibrium at all levels of life and development. The great theologians were therefore quite excellent biologists, who celebrated the circumstances of transfiguration in the Holy Mass so admirably that no great skill is required to draw very practical con- clusions from such a doctrine. Since pressure and suction operate simultane- ously on a common biological axis, all that need be done is merely to transfer the ritual of the Mass into rational pr actice in order, for example, to atomise water into air. In such a way an id eal means for producing mechanical pres- sure is born, which is significantly be tter and above all, more naturalesque than all contemporary means of pres sure and explosion put together. All water contains bipolar gases. It is a physical frontier zone, so to speak, in which all sorts of interesting bacteriophagous, intermediary elements of bipolar nature are contained. These phil osopher's stones are almost impossible to detect. If quite ordinary water, with a high gas content and deficient in energy, is swirled in cycloid centripulsers, its whole condition can be com- pletely reversed, producing a deficiency of gas and a wealth of energy. This happens as a result of the repetitive generation and development of plas- molytic pressure and suction in the cen tripulser.

To bring this about atmospheric oxygon has to be introduced through needle jets. A new air with very high potential (frequency or vibration) is instantly pro- duced in this way. So that the whole thing does not shoot straight up into Nirvana, it simultaneously gives birth to a multiplicity of higher carrier sub- stances in order to produce the necessar y counterweighing pressure. This restraining force helps the mass of the Earth to counteract the force of levitation. The force of gravity is therefore a concept to be taken very relatively. It becomes utterly and completely uninteresting if one merely moves a mass of very ordi- nary air cycloidally. With the use of this ultimate fuel the scales are tipped, the last counterweight falls away and ther e is no longer any excuse for upholding such cumbersome concepts. There is no longer any \"she half-pulled him, he half- sank on her\". 87 All that is left is the purest levitation. For this reason this autarchi- cal upward propulsion must be ha ndled with the very greatest care. But let us return to the naturalesque inauguration of th is silent, odourless, expansive force. Actually it is only required to start cycloid motion and only initiates the overture, as it were. It is therefore merely a practical aid for unleashing the ur-force. Physics and Metaphysics It was already stressed at the beginning th at there are no technical or scientific expressions for metaphysics. Since no exact terminology exists, complicated paraphrasing is required to describe the higher origins and causes of motion and formation. Physics makes use of various pistons, substances, mechanical or physical forces in order to create motion. Metaphysics uses motive forces that are similar in principle but are ra ised one octave higher. In every case, only those forces which improve the quality and condition of the substance to be moved are used by the metaphysicist, who knows that all natural process- es are interconnected with physical (mechanical) motion. These mechanical and physical forces, however, are applied only in the smallest amount in order to provide the necessary impulses to activate the more important plasmolytic forces. The metaphysicist utilises these higher and more powerful energies to initiate a new interchange of substances. In doing so he achieves a nascent kinetic energy, an inner potential, strong enough to interact with the surrounding concentrations of energy of oppo- site potential. Motive forces and velo cities are produced of a magnitude contemporary physicists and engineers are incapable of conceiving, because their thinking is logical and not biologi cal or ecological. They employ direct 87 Quotation from Goethe. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"methods and approaches which produce minimal Eff ects or usable energy and inflict severe damage on growth and the environment generally. Today's sophist has stamped the conception of the world with an alien charac- ter by disseminating the view that a certain quantity of energy always remains constant and against which an immutable fo rce of gravity is active. If today this gravitational force is hardly ever mentioned and attempts are made to maintain and intensify locomotive power, it is only indicative of the search for other and better solutions. They cannot be found, however, because thousands of years of deductive thinking have deformed our pr ocesses of thought. On this well- grooved track every flash of inspiration a nd its outcome has been and is derailed. The human organism can be compared to a high-pressure boiler whose safety valve blows when the maximum permissible steam or gas pressure is exceeded, whereupon the boiler flashes b ack from high to medium pressure. This results in the strong accretion and deposition of boiler-scale so that eventually the boiler can only be used at medium pressure. Its efficiency constantly decreases as the accumulation of scale increases. Metaphysically speaking, this means that with the use of naturalesque and potential- enhancing processes, not only can high-qu ality solidification of basic ele- ments (growth in the form of food) be brought about, but also quantitatively and qualitatively increased growth of mi nerals and metals too. In addition, a waxing, formative, motive power is produced, which will make problems of food supply, raw materials and energy a thing of the past. Through the naturalesque creation of potential and the correct method of intensifying the causal processes of substa nce interchange and potential alterna- tion, all waste and reversionary matter are always precipitated out in a more evolved state. The whole secret of evolu tion therefore lies in the self-regulating increase of impulsion and expulsion that takes place under no rmal conditions, which is inherent in the rhythm of life and its evolutionary purpose. Today's scientists unques tioningly adopted rigid theorems and principles and turned them into dogmas. These we re foisted on them by a group of peo- ple who had no desire to increase and improve the quality of foods and other necessities of life. Any increase in mental ab ility was of absolutely no interest to them because it did not serve their pl ans for domination. The effect of this was a constant increase in labour itself and the number of people forced to work. More and more these dubious i ndividuals sabotaged the mutually- amplifying interaction between impuls ion and expulsion. In the high pres- sure boiler of the Earth the expansive pressure dropped due to a reduction in the ennoblement of impulsive and levita tive substances. At the same time the quality and quantity of precipitated re versionary matter, the amount of boiler- scale, constantly diminished and was of less and less value. In other words, fewer and fewer compounds of mineral, metallic or vegeta ble raw materials (growth products) were produced, and all the while the quality of these"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"products of solidification declined. As was said earlier, these products are the basic elements for life development of higher potential. The bio-ecological outcome of this was, a shortage of food coupled with a cat- astrophic decline in mental health and vi gour. This opened the way to a thriv- ing traffic in the necessities of life founded on the absence of high-quality precipitates and a dearth of powerful intu itive abilities or products of the mind. The poor wretches of labouring human ox en were ultimately led to believe that the wages they received for their toil an d trouble would be paid in heaven. The Most Iniquitous Deception Philo was the founder of philosophy. Classical physics is none other than applied philosophy. Only through the most disastrous experiences will peo- ple become wiser and renounce this form of science. The question \"Why does the heart beat?\" irritates every doctor. The question \"What actually is motion?\" reduces every mechanician or professor of physics to a state of fury, particularly if he is asked, \"What is to be understood by mechanical or physical motion and what differences exist between them?\". Neither of them are able to give an answer. If they were aware of the differences, they would also know what motion actually signifies and would need to learn neither physics nor mechanics in order to teach it. They woul d also have no need of their profes- sions once the question \"what actually is motion?\" has been thoroughly clarified. Motion is the product of potential differences of physical or metaphysical origin. In this regard it is of crucial importance whether the motion is initiated from outside-inwards or from inside-outwards. Apart from these, further differ- ences also exist, however. A stone, for example, can be moved physically by an external agency, with a shove or a kick, or it can be moved metaphysical- ly by being made to leap up musically or through the agency of music. This is what happened to the walls of Je richo, which were demolished by the impact of the sound of trumpets. Today this can no longer be explained, because the motional rhythm or the previously discussed mysterious process of insuction or inner attraction, engendered by an external impulse, has been ignored. This is how vibrati on begins and explains in a flash the concept of motion. Thus the whole of science can be literally reduced to its own atoms and a new science of life created from the analysed remains. This knowledge has been so thoroughly buried that today nobody can say what life actually is, whence it comes and where it goes. No-one any longer knows that life or autonomous movement is the product of a vibrating vibra- tion and a moving movement. This rhythmically-moving rhythm arises when the two components of pressure and suction, or the 'backward-and-for- ward', the 'up-and-down' and the 'inward-and-outward', are rotated to the"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"left and to the right in tree-quarter time about a common developmental axis. Here positive potency is to be regarded as pressure and the negative potency as motion, or the former as the gravitating and the latter as the levi- tating. Expressed differently, the attr acting and the repelling must be moved in opposite directions along the axis. Without a model to demonstrate this practically, it is almost impossible to picture what form this motion takes. The product of this primeval, elementa l motion is the 'obverse', the indiffer- ent, formless, bacteriophagous mist th at forms between existence and non- existence, which expres sed differently is syno nymous with 'Life'. All the philosophasters (the be-wigged and be-gowned) had to do, there- fore, was to suppress the natural communion between the basic elements of evolution through the enforced applica tion of classical physics and the doc- trines of mechanics. Ecologically and biologically this resulted in the elimi- nation of sources of qualigen, which in evitably led to a worsening shortage of food and spiritual impoverishment. Thus reduced to the lowest level of existence, the last vestiges of human dignity were in great danger of being trampled underfoot by collectivism (communism). It is therefore high time to set about reversing this process. The Birth of Basic Elements and Subtle Matter All basic matter carries within it the seed (DNA) of reproduction and upward evolution (for the increase and qualitative improvement of higher forms of matter). The sole purpose of the force of physical weight, the force of gravity, is to initiate inner processes of substance interchange and alterna- tion of potential. These encompass two fundamentally different orders of metaphysical dynamics which are: (1) groups of essences producing metaphysical pressure or repulsion; (2) groups of essences producing metaphysical suction or attraction. If, as was explained above, the retaining bonds of high-frequency water are removed, or it is atomically decompresse d or atomised, then an increased and intensified, more highly-charged build-up of air-pressure normally results. This in turn serves for the inward fall of seminal substances. If this expansive force encounters a resistance in the form of a pi ston, then the piston is moved by ele- mental forces, resulting in a natural and almost silent motive impulse. The pres- sure-release valve in this instance is the mechanical piston. If the potential and polarity of high-frequency water, super-saturated with metal embryos or min- eral structures (carbones), is reduced by diffuse solar energies (oxygen) under the hermetic exclusion of air and with slight warming, then a convergent, centre-directed heat-pressur e evolves. At the same time, however, an inner de-"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"energising of highly active fructigenic elements, the matrices of ions or elec- tions, takes place, resulting in their solid ification. A growth in minerals and metals ensues, whereby the weight of th e parent materials does not reduce, but increases in the same way that the girth and weight of a female creature nor- mally does after conception. This is because every conception creates the pre- conditions for further conception - the fi rst division of a cell, for example, creates the conditions for the later division of the two original halves. If high-frequency water is not de-energ ised or its energy modified, if the motion responsible for the generation of high-frequency continues unabat- ed, then the horizontal propagation of negatively-charged embryons 88 takes place, i.e. the emission of negatively charged, ion-like or electron-like embryonic formations. The dynamic aspe ct of the geosphere then experi- ences a growth, which expands parall el to the ground-surface and has the same wave-like crests and troughs as the ground-surf ace itself, which should be viewed as solidified geospheric energy. It is that part of the terres- trial mass, whose upper layers are sealed off by the film of protoplasms, the virgin hymen of the birth-giving Earth. If these highly potent, wavelike forma tions are bombarded by diffuse, lightless and all-penetrating peak-ene rgies of seminal matter, the Sun's (cathodic) 'cosmic' rays, then a ne gatively super-charged build-up of groundwater results. The groundwater it self is a by-product of synthesis which continuously binds all newly pr oduced fructigenic structures. The effect of this is to cause an unceasin g rise and fall of th e groundwater body. Because groundwater consta ntly discharges its accumu lated energy into the root-tips of the vegetation, its potentia l builds up and discharges at rhyth- mical intervals. This giv es rise to the pulsation of the Blood of the Earth. The discharge from the high-frequenc y accumulator (the groundwater) into the root-tips (root-protoplasms) in turn encounters the discharges from the cathode system of the Sun. The ou tcome of this interaction is then organic growth, or expressed otherwise, the self-concentrating precipitation of frequency-depleted matter with a lower level of dynamic energy These agglomerations contain all the semina l, fructigenic and stimulating ele- ments required for the creation of an organic whole. That is, apart from the principal basic elements, they also contain catalytic motion and interaction inciters. These provide the true im pulse enabling reprodu ction and ennoble- ment to reach their perfection on the path of evolution. That this should actually happen requir es the prior existence of the appro- priate preconditions; the proper propor tions between various basic ele- ments, the exclusion of atmospheric influences and the presence of the necessary resistances. Through these the heat-inducing elements are de-acti- vated, leading to the evolution of cool ing influences vital to growth.

The Group of Metaphysical Pressural Elements This encompasses three possibilities. 1. The virtually cost-free impulse-imparting motion of Repulsators and Repulsines (substance-interchanging an d potential-alternating machines); 2. The controlled increase of the growth of catalysts and the growth of high- grade metals and minerals; 3. The increase and ennoblement of organic growth. This metaphysical pre ssure-element group therefore enables the super- abundance of food to be regulated almost at will. Its other associated fields of application are: • the creation and control of temperature; • the production of heat and ice; • the ecotechnical raising of water; • the generation of motive power for all types of machine; • the propulsion system for vessels that have to operate in the absence of air, such as submarines. The Group of Metaphysical Tractive or Suctional Elements If ordinary air is moved cydoidally, it can be just as easily enriched as can ordi- nary water in order to increase the performance of metaphysical product Then, after indifferent substances, which are contained in the air in suspen- sion, have first been dissociated, products are formed that are the result of pri- mary synthesis. In the process positive atmospheric potencies accumulate and are then transformed into negative dy nagen structures, which are virtually carrier-less. Discarding all coarse, physical matter (atmospheric water parti- cles), they rise autonomously as e xponents of pure levitation. All motion impeding resistances, even the aircraft itself in which this effect is produced, will be drawn up in their wake, because the organic vacuum which develops in front of the craft (a spaceless and formle ss state of quality and an almost total vacuity) has an adsuctional function. Whereas the air-masses (discarded matter) expelled sideways and towards the rear can only slowly achieve equilibrium with those that surround them. In this way a wedging pressure and hence a forward pressure is exerted on the teardrop- shaped body of an aircraft or sub- marine. This pressure acts along the long itudinal axis in the same direction as"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"the suction (see fig. 9). Th e trout demonstrates this to us in every natural, untouched watercourse: its arrowlike fl i g h t upstream against the current making the faces of our physici sts grow longer and longer. Steerage is achieved with an articula ted swivelling Repulsine-head, which creates an organic vacuum in the desired direction of travel. This ideal air- craft therefore only requires fin-like stabilising surfaces (similar to flying fish) and somewhat larger tail-fins in order to guide and move it through the air, or in the case of submarines, in and under water at lighting speed. The operating range is unlimited, because the fuel (which is also growth- promoting) required to provide the impulse for cycloid or plasmolytic motion can be generated from the surrounding media of water and air in unlimited quantity, through inbuilt Repulsators (high-frequency water-generators). The same supporting force (floating powe r) that also carries this dung-heap Earth and rotates it about its own axis can therefore be generated almost with- out effort and expense. Orientation and control is done by the pilot, who also owes his or her own orientational f aculties and physical strength to the Fig. 9. The stationary trout. 89 The trout normally swims in the mi ddle of the central current vortex, where the water is densest and coldest. Due to the volume of its body, the individual current filaments are displaced and compressed. This causes their accel eration and eventually their critical velocities are exceeded, which results in the formation of vor tices (counter-currents) along the rear part of the body. These vortices act counter to the direction of the current and provide the counter-thrust required by the trout to remain stationary in this fast flow ing water. If it needs to accelerate upstream, then it flaps its gills, creating a further vortex train along its flanks, thus increasing the counter-thrust upstream. The more rapid the gill-movements, the faster the trout moves upwards against the current. 89 This illustration has been reproduced from the editor's own book, Living Energies, for better understanding. - Ed ."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"cycloid movement of the blood, whence the supplementary forces arise that carry, s h i f t and orientate h i m or her, and sustain life. This is how the general interaction ta kes place in which every creature is reunited with its metaphysical, genetic stock. In this way everything serves the will of the Creator on a common evolutionary axis. Everything furthers the general purposes of reproduction, regeneration, upward development, evolution, growth and dissolution. Everything also provides for the struc- turing and build-up of crude and refined matter from which the cultivable mobile vitalis is produced. The disint egrative forces are also intensified, which, for one reason or another, dispo se of those things that have failed to meet the requirements of the path of evolution. It is precisely this disintegrative fo rce that today's science is escalating and with which it brakes the cultivable path of evolution. It brings about an evolu- tionary standstill and inaugurates the collapse of western culture. The influ- ences of fire and heat belong to the mo st dangerous, retrogressive products of synthesis. A General Explanation of 'Plasmolytic Motion' In order to get some idea of the form ation of blood and sap, the water-process- ing systems of plants should be studie d. The contribution of plants to the amount of water accumulated in the atmo sphere is demonstrated by the fact that a large birch tree contributes about 7, 000 litres (1,540 gals) of water over the course of a single summer, representing the precipitated waste-material accru- ing from the formation of sa p. This volume of water is transpired into the sur- rounding air via the leaves. Stated more accurately: the primary products of synthesis carry up this quantity of water with them in their wake in the small- est packets and hand them on to the levitational substances of the air. Nature has equipped every plant with its water-production system and every plant produces its own kind of wate r. The primary products of synthesis infuse themselves into such water. In a certain sense they carry the abode for their brief future sojourn in the atmos phere about with them. This explains how positively-charged high-frequency essences are born from the negative- ly-charged atmosphere, wh ich together with heavy, solidified Earth-masses counteract the levitational forces that develop in higher regions. In some situations it so happens that these extraordinarily powerful, primary products of synthesis (levitationa l forces) have not been sufficiently bound by the counteractive influences of light and heat. In barren high-moun- tain regions they are insufficiently encumbered with ballasting material. In these locations the phenomena of so-ca lled ball-lightning, giant-size Elmo's fire in egg-shaped form, flares up, wh ich in most instances can be observed above the very tops of the trees towards midday. They sizzle like lighted"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"baptismal candles and then quickly go out. The cloud-like condensation trails they produce, akin to those formed by ai rcraft in tight turns, are the surest sign that there will be a heavy thunderstorm a few hours later. At certain locations high up in the mountains and particularly out of crevasses in glaciers, very sudden vortex-like up-winds bur st forth, which swirl large quantities of snow upward s with tremendous force. Even chunks of ice are torn away and lifted high up into the air. This is a sign that the counterweighing seminal substances (the force of gravity plus oxygen) are unable to consume (bind) the soaring levi tational forces. In the majority of such cases light intensity and heat ar e insufficient, which like warming water normally render energetic fructigens inact ive. The reverting levitational sub- stances then manifest themselves as sparkling bubbles of carbon-dioxide, primarily where the strongest incident light and heat are active. These rever- sionary products are the true threshol d elements, which immediately repro- duce and upwardly evolve when such water is moved cycloidally under the exclusion of light and heat. Under su ch conditions, for example, new water is created, which, floating freely, no lo nger obeys the law of gravity and rises up a vertical pipe despite the pressure of air weighing down upon it. Merely touching this bubble of water with the end of a metal needle is enough to discharge it, where upon it falls back instantaneously. This explains how atomically-heavy masses of oxygen, in combination with finely-dispersed large agglomerations of atmospheric water, are able to float. In these structures, though difficult to determine exactly, the Earth's high-fre- quency and primary products of synthesis are contained in the form of free energy. They also make springwater sp ecifically-heavier, dense and cool. The water in high-mountain springs is full of levitative power, and inasmuch as high-grade springwater is actually pres ent, the spring sp rings upwards. The peoples of ancient cultures made use of this process to lift enormous quanti- ties of fresh water to any desired height. In this regard, the rising pipes must be shaped like blood-vesse ls, i.e. they must incorporate cycloid space-curves. All these observations give rise to a true conception of the world, which revolves like a fertilised yolk-sac with in the surrounding concentration of energetic fructigens. The same process of development takes place on a large scale that daily occurs in every incubati ng chicken's egg. Moreover, it is also the same process that can be observed in a natural, unt ouched stream. Along its longitudinal axis a zone of concentrated dynagen comes into being through the free and unimpeded movement of cycloidally-swirled fructi- gens, which react to biocentripetence. Seminal substances congregating along the flow-axis are surrounded by these fructigens and bound by them. This results in the formation of calyx-like or funnel-shaped, refluent energy flows. These in turn activate the marv ellous twofold brake, which retards forward movement of the main body of water as it flows down a gradient."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"In this vortex or flow-brake, a trout is able to float motionlessly. Whenever it intensifies the transfor mative processes with the aid of the cycloid curves of i t s gills, it is accel erated upstream at the speed of light- ning. This is yet another clue as to how naturalesquely-built aircraft and submarines can also move with equal speed. Every plant is an extremely efficient pr oducer of water. On no account is it any kind of water-consumer. The root-tip s of all species of plant are hermetical- ly enclosed by protoplasmic structur es, which even gaseous elements are unable to penetrate. The formation of the later structure with more highly evolved basic elements is only possible through this hygienic filtration of all physical raw material (solid, liquid and gaseous). This growth will be impaired, for example, if root-protoplasms are etched away by artificial fertiliser, or if they wither or become porous. Inferior substa nces are then up-taken and inaugurate cancerous decay. In trees this begins in side the base of the trunk and spreads, blackening the branches, which rot right through to the pith where they spring from the trunk. To an alert forester this is an indication that the proper mixture of species is out of balance and that the accumulation of geospheric soil-poten- tial has been disturbed or is taking place unnaturalesquely. Every cell creates its own protoplasmic nucleus autonomously. Every proto- plasmic structure generates new protoplasmic energies for its own use. This explains, for example, how a large ches tnut tree can effortlessly counteract the heavy weight of its leaves, flowers and nuts, which collectively weigh several tonnes. In such a tree-commun ity millions of minute power-stations operate jointly in order to maintain the carrying capacity, tractive energies and orientational force, i.e. the life-f orce. This is the reason why sap suppos- edly rises in trees often a hundred metres high. This is none other than the consequence of a rhythm against whic h a deracinated humanity, imprisoned within walls of its own creation 90 , toils by the sweat of its brow. All visible phenomena, it is immaterial whether these relate to a solid, liquid or gaseous product of growth, or a species of water, blood or sap, are the reversionary products of primary products of synthesis. It is an outfall of energetically deplet- ed matter which possesses too little intrinsic potential and solidifies under the influence of light and heat. Due to the cycloid motion of the Earth they are able to produce the physical seeds for their own reproduction and, as the finished products of raw materials, they die off as the plasmolytic forces are extinguished. Eventually falling back into the Earth, they enter a zone isolated from light, air and heat. Ther e they are decomposed by analysing and vibrating energies in preparatio n for their contribution towards the build-up of the soil's metaphysical and energetic potential. 90 Here the German word 'freigemauerten' is used .

This process of growth and transformati on, or the alternation of potential, which perpetually renews itself at any given moment in the ever-changing forms of manifestation, must be copied . In order to do this, protoplasma-like, naturalesquely-alloyed, pul sating devices are required, which must operate and rhythmically alternate at high speed. This will furnish proof that this structure- creating process is the one that furthe rs the natural course of evolution. Thus the way has been opened for the Crown of Creation to become the highest servant of the Lord of this Creative Work and hence the director of a grandiose scheme of evolution. Perhaps the people of this century have been given a unique opportunity to become as Gods, as they struggle up this knife-edge ridge, fraug ht with the ever-present danger of plunging into the bottomless abyss. Whoever masters the process of metamor- phosis in its formative sense acquires the abilities of the Creator. Whoever masters metamorphosis in its destructiv e sense becomes a tool and the servant of the devil, and it behoves such a person to carry out the work of destruction. Organic Syntheses - Conclusion A few examples will now demonstrate what energies are actually present in the various types of blood and sap. It should be noted in this regard that crude and subtle energies are not merely su mmated (increased arithmetically), but squared (increased geometrically) as well. It is only thus that the magnitude of elemental carrying and tractive forces becomes understandable. These can be controlled in miniature machines by regulating the rate of rotation. As do all other plants, a grapevine cut off about 80cm (30in) above the ground exhibits symptoms of bleeding. In the process the sap is expressed with a pressure sufficient to raise a column of mercury in a barometer by 112mm. Desert plants generate plasmoly tic pressural and suctional forces in the order of 100 atmospheres or more. We are not concerned here with the raising of a nutrient solution in the accepted sense, but with upward and downward pulsating, procreative events . With every pulsebeat the primary structures in the hierarchy of structur es are produced. The higher and faster the beat, the higher the potential pressu re evolving from the previous evolu- tion of potential pressure. This ultimat ely reverses polarity into high fre- quency, which results in the creation of increa singly refined secondary"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"products of synthesis. These reinforce every renewed process of growth and transformation so that out of the original precipitation into matter an instinctual awareness is born. An outfl ow arises out of this from which the mysterious possibility of overcoming one's own gravity or physical weight and its associated life-force spring forth. This also explains how birds are able to fly, which they do with virtually no effort. At the bottom of the quill of ev ery flight-feather there is a small motor in the form of an energy-sac (protopl asm), which with the slightest impulse- giving movement (beat of the wings) endo ws every particle of the wing with levitational substances. The bird does not fly, but it is flown. The fish too docs not swim, but is swum. It steers itself in the desired direction with its fins, just as we do with our feet. It has no awar eness of its own weight , just as a young, healthy human being experiences no oppress ive weight on its feet. If the fish's supposedly air-filled swim-bladder or th e bird's quill-sac is damaged, then despite fins and feathers, all swimming and flying are over. Even our own ability to move comes to an end if bi ovolts and bioamperes can no longer be generated in the bloodstream of our ow n organism. The same applies to all our senses, which owe their activating fo rce to the 'plasmolytic' motor that Leonardo da Vinci calle d \"il primo movere\". The impetus of Will is the waviform sh aft about which this rotates, whose plan and elevation are identical. The working drawing for this we find in every well-formed hen's egg, the form of whose shell contains all the neces- sary constructional profiles. Sven Hedin gives a very interesting and illustrative example in his book, The flight of the Great Horse, where he describes aqueducts through which it was possible to grow the finest of cer eals in the middle of Asia's waterless wastelands. These are the last remnants of an ancient people, who were still aware of the necessity to move the Blood of the Earth (water) cycloidally. These canals were laid between 1 and 2 metres underground and their gradi- ents followed the contours of the ground surface. As a rule, therefore, their longitudinal shape is wave-form. These channels represent a sort of artificial geotherm (stratum of equal temperat ure). At intervals these conduits are interrupted by shafts which are inclin ed in the direction of flow. These are used for access, for th e cleansing of the channel and to aid the water to regen- erate itself with the induction of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The main orien- tation of these canals is north-sout h. However, where ground conditions permit, they are laid from west to east on principle (using the geostrophic effect on west->east flows). In such cases, and right in the middle of the desert, the vigorous growth of the nobles t cereals is evident both to right and left of the underground canal. Wars eith er decimated those entrusted with the techniques of building these aqueducts or drove them from their homeland, and in this way the art of growing corn in desert regions was lost."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Similar installations were built by Moorish peoples. The only difference being that the Moors dug no canals. Th ey dug funnel-shaped cisterns in the ground instead, which had definite long itudinal and transv erse cross-sec- tions.

As a rule these funnel-shaped cister ns were dug in marshy and sour ground, where- on a lush growth of sweet grasse s appeared shor tly thereafter. Apart from a few scanty references in old chronicles and oral transmissions, more detailed information about these curious installations cannot be found. In this way the valuable knowledge of th e essential nature of these water-cul- tures was lost. It was only observations in field and forest over many years that led to the rediscovery of this long-lost knowledge. In the near future its renaissance will change all forestry, ag riculture and water resources manage- ment, for with the installation of such water conduits and cisterns it is possi- ble to increase the productivity of the soil several times over. These water conduits, or the chambe rs with unusual longitudinal and transverse cross-sections, have to be placed at a certain depth. They are none other than electrical devices, a sp ecial type of dynamo. They emit an animal radiation into the surrounding soil which is generated by the move- ment of water. This radiation is broadc ast laterally and generates a stratified potential-field in the ground (in contrast to all surface canalisation, which discharges the ground). Following ground- contours, this potential-field is essentially magnetic in nature. It is propagated horizontally and in it centrifugating and centripeta ting pulsations develop. This regular rhythmi- cal movement moves in towards the centre only to move outwards again. Just as they did thousands of years ago, there are still 'initiates' today who watch over and see to it that the great secret of evolution is safeguard- ed from those whose interests are served by ensuring that humanity remains divorced and disconnected from Nature. It was not without good reason that Schiller told of the youth, who in his overwhelming desire for knowledge, ripped away the veil shrouding the image of truth. The priests found him the next day at the foot of th e alter of Isis. Whatever he had seen or experienced his tongue was never able to express. Human beings are what they eat and they will remain as animals for as long as the production of qualigen is suppressed. In this way a vicious circle is closed: polluted water can create no wholesome food; th erefore contami- nated water and poi soned food can create no he althy blood; therefore un- healthy blood inhibits a healthily functioning mind; therefore these degenerate qualities will then be passed on to later generations via the pro- duction of genetically impaired, seminal matter. Western man is the victim of a life and energy-subverting principle. We have lost our greatest asset, our intu ition, and have thereby become a crea-"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"ture even lower than the animals, a creature condemned to senseless toil. We will have to suffer t h e t o t a l loss of our bearings during our 1,000-year long period of re-evolvement. Nature has no use for to iling human brings. What she does need, however, is the extremel y fine adjustment and regulation of the impulse with which all growth in Nature can be energised and regulated as circumstances demand. If this Will should be reawakened and the impuls- es magnified with the aid of ecotechnical appliances, then the effects of this period of decline will be overcome within a relatively short time. Everything superior falls step by step upwards (levitates). Conversely, all that is inferior and unusable falls stage by stage downwards. The more use- less such a thing is, the lower the level to which it has to fall until it reaches the place where the crucible for all u nnatural products of synthesis glows darkly. It is here, where the dark fire smoulders, that everything is reduced to the lowest level of evolution by extremely aggressive seminal matter (oxygen). The sly priests called this place the hell of eternal damnation. What they called heaven is in reality a concentration of energy similar to a fructigen-sac in a fertilised chicken's egg, which floats and slowly turns about its own axis under the influence of cons tantly-fluctuating variations in tem- perature. In the process, a gentle life-c urrent will be emitted in the form of impulses which, with a moist tongue, can be sensed as a cool ness at the point- ed end of the egg and as a warmness at the rounder end. If the gyrations of this life-motor are increased through higher temperatures produced by a brooding hen or the brooding Sun, then in the protoplasm, enclosed by the coarse and fine material of the eggs hell, a mysterious weaving and coiling about the yolk begins. A maternalistic expansion and an enveloping, loving and nurturing motion begins, which lead s to the consumption of that s u b - stance in which has been instilled the ir resistible urge so ardently awaited. It is necessary to read Goethe in or der to understand everything t h a t takes place at this moment. This great German poet must also be read with a kinship and affinity for Nature in order to comprehend these mysterious events clearly and to establish the ultimate truth. Otherwise, as Schiller said, one could end up \"pale and insensible at Isis' feet\", when the vision of truth unveils itself layer by layer. One h as also to understand Shakespeare, who described life as a fairytale hitherto e xperienced and fashioned by fools. In the search for intuitively talented individuals we happen upon the great painters, sculptors and the musically gifted, who were unconditionally faithful to the 'Eternally Transmutable' in Nature and obeyed her inner rhythm. They too were able to initiate impulses. In this way the flare-up of lightning (enlightenment) also occurred, which lit up everything as broad daylight. With this also came the realisation t h a t this arc of lightning (illumination) ignited and sparked off the impulse to reverse the decline that has arisen from a single misconception."}]
