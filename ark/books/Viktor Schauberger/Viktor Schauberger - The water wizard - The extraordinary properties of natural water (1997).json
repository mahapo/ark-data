I came across this attractive little book in 1979 and had it translated into English. Living Water is now in its eighth printing and has inspired many to go on to Callum Coats' in-depth study of Schauberger's ideas, Living Energies, which was published in 1996 . My friendship with Callum goes back to 1981 wh en he confided in me hi s wish to write a defini- tive work on Viktor Schauberger. Ca llum had met Viktor's son, Walter Schauberger, in 1977 and was to spend three years studying with Walter at his Pythogoras-Keppler System Institute in Lauffen, in the Saltzkammergut near Salzburg. During that time, Callu m was given access to all Viktor's writings. Viktor Schauberger did not start serious ly to write about his ideas and his discoveries until the age of 44, when he acquired a distinguished sponsor in Professor Philipp Forchheimer. As Callu m describes later in this volume, Forchheimer, a world famous hydrologist , had been asked by the Austrian Government to report on Schauberger's controversial log flumes, which transported large amounts of timber from inaccessible locations without damage. He was so impressed with Schauberger's discoveries that he asked him to write a paper which was published in 1930 in Die Wasserwirtschaft, the Austrian Journal of Hydrology. This paper attracted the attention of the President of the Austrian Academy of Science, Professor Wilhelm Exner, and resulted in a commission to write a mo re detailed study of his theories for that same magazine under the title Temperature and the Movement of Water. Schauberger's ideas flew completely in the face of conventional ideas of hydrology and water management and, as a result, gained him many ene- mies in scientific circles. The reason Viktor developed the strong feelings about orthodox scientific research that you will read in this and subsequent volumes was partly to defend himself fr om their attacks, and partly out of his despair at witnessing the ongoing de struction of the natural environ- ment by their blind and uncaring technol ogies. It was this despair that motivated him to write his only book, Our Senseless Toil - the Cause of the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"World Crisis. It was published at a time ot severe depressi o n , when many were worried about the future. After Forchheimer died, Schauberger found another ally in Professor Werner Zimmermann who en couraged Viktor in 1935-1936 to write about the damage being wrought to the great rivers, the Rhine and the Danube, in a small 'new thought' magazine Tau. After Schauberger's death, two maga- zines published furthe r collections of Schauberger's writings: Implosion was started by a student and co llaborator of Viktor's, a nd published a number of his articles in the 1960s. Mensch und Technik in the 1970s publ ished articles by and about Viktor Schauberger for the more free-thinking scientific com- munity. Callum Coats has skilfully woven together these articles, together with correspondence with other scientists, fr iends and officials of one kind or another, into a fascinating tapestry which gives a true and very readable account of Schauberger's impassiond ca mpaign to alert the world to the dangers of the prevailing scientific dogma. Unfortunately, not much has changed, and Schauberger's vision of how humanity must work coopera- tively with Nature if we ar e to have a future, is perhaps more relevant than ever. Callum arranged this massive amount of material into a large volume, Eco-Technology. In considering this for publicatio n, we realised that it would be much more accessible in several vol umes, arranged by theme. This first one, The Water Wizard, is devoted to Schauberger's ideas about water and rivers. The second, Nature as Teacher, concerns the wider implications of his ideas on water and energy. The third, The Fertile Earth, describes the way trees transform energy, and the processes of fertilisation of the soil. The final volume, The Energy Revolution, gathers together the discussion and description of Schauberger's applian ces for purifying and energising water and for producing vast amounts of vi rtually free energy. Together with Living Energies, the Eco-technology series give a comple te account of the vision and genius of one of the founde rs of the present ecological move- ment, and are an inspiration for all those who wish to see our precious Earth saved from extinction by short-sightedness and greed, and the emer- gence of a new partnershi p with bountiful Nature. Alick Bartholomew, Wellow, December 1997"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A Brief Introduction to the Natural Eco-Technological Theories of Viktor Schauberger Viktor Schauberger (30 June 1885 - 25 September 1958) was born in Austria of a long line of foresters stretching back some four hundred years. He developed a gift for accurate and intuitive observation so great that he was able to perceive the natural energi es and other phenomena occurring in Nature, which are still un recognised by ort hodox science. Re fusing to attend University at the ag e of 18, to the fury of his father, Viktor Schauberger left home and spent a long period alone in the high, remote forest, contemplat- ing, pondering and observing any subtle energetic processes taking place in Nature's laboratory, where they were still undisturbe d by human hand. During this period he deve loped very profound and radical theories, later to be confirmed practically, concerning water, the energies inherent in it and its desired natural form of motion. Thes e eventually earned him the name of 'The Water Wizard'. For the whole of his life he fought a running a nd often acrimonious battle with academia and its institutions, since his theories in the main were dia- metrically opposed to the so-called established facts of science. His practical demonstration of them always functione d as he had theorised, however, for he had come to understand the true inne r workings of Nature and was able to emulate them. Viktor Schauberger's theories afford new insights into the naturally cor- rect or 'naturalesque' management of water. This encompasses its proper handling, storage, and conduction by mean s that promote its self-purifica- tion, the retention and enha ncement of its natural en ergies and health. In this book, the close interrelationship between water and the forest (as a water-producer - not a water consumer) is examined. The problem of soil salinity and how this comes about through over-exposure of the soil to the radiance of the Sun through deforestation and faulty agricultural practices, are also addressed. Indications are gi ven as to how these may be avoided and overcome, due to Viktor Schauberg er's radical and fundamentally new understanding of the coming into bei ng and functioning of the groundwater table in relation to soil temperature. As a natural organism, water is formed and functi ons according to"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Nature's laws and geometry, the latter exhibiting none of the elements of the straight line, circle and point, the ba sis of modern mechanical and techno- logical artefacts. Reflecting Nature's principal constant, namely that of con- tinuous change and transformation, the vortex epitomises this form of open, fluid and flexible motion . Through his study of th e vortices occurring natu- rally in flowing water and in the air in the form of cyclones and tornadoes, Viktor Schauberger developed his theori es of implosion. It was through the research and development of these theo ries that he was able to produce spring-quality water and generate considerable energies in and with water and air. In listing some of his accomplishments one could not do better than to quote from his book, Our Senseless Toil, written in 1933: \"It is possible to regulate watercourses over any given distance without embank- ment works; to transport timber and other materials, even when heavier than water, for example ore, stones, etc., down the cen tre of such water-courses; to raise the height of the water table in the surrounding countryside and to endow the water with all those elements necessary for the prevailing vegetation.\" \"Furthermore it is possible in this way to render timber and other such materials non-inflammable and rot resistant; to produce drinking and spa-water for man, beast and soil of any desired composition and perfor mance artificially, but in the way that it occurs in Nature; to raise water in a vertical pipe without pumping devices; to pro- duce any amount of electricity and radiant energy almost without cost; to raise soil quality and to heal cancer, tuberculosis and a variety of nervous disorders.\" \"... the practical implementation of this ... would without doubt signify a com- plete reorientation in all areas of scien ce and technology. By application of these new found laws, I have already constructed fairly large installations in the spheres of log-rafting and river regulation, which as is known, have functioned faultlessly for a decade, and which today still present insoluble enigmas to the various scientif- ic disciplines concerned.\" Water and its vital interaction with the forest was Viktor's principal pre- occupation. He viewed water as a living entity, the 'Blood of Mother-Earth', which is born in the womb of the fore st. Our mechanistic, materialistic and extremely superficial way of looking at things, however, prevents us from considering water to be anything other than inorganic, i.e. supposedly with- out life but, while apparently having no life itself, can nevertheless miracu- lously create life in all its forms. Li fe is movement and is epitomised by water, which is in a cons tant state of motion and tr ansformation, both exter- nally and internally. In confirmation of this fact, water is able to combine with more substances than any other molecule and, flowing as water, sap and blood, is the creator of the myriad life-forms on this planet. How then could it ever be construed as life-less in accordance with th e chemist's clini- cal view of water, defined as the inorganic substance H 2 O? This short"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"description is a gros misrepresentation, As the fundamental basis of all life, water is itself a living entity and should be treated as such. Failure to do so quickly transforms it into an enemy, rather than the nurturer and furtherer of all life that it should be \"Th is civilisation is the work of man, who high-handedly and ignorant of the true workings of Nature, ha s created a world without meaning or foundation, which now thre atens to destroy hi m, for through his behaviour and his activities, he , who should be her master, has disturbed Nature's inherent unity.\" Apart from the more familiar categories of water, th ere are, according to Viktor Schauberger, as many varieties of water as there are animals and plants. Were water merely the sterile, distilled H 2 0 as claimed by science, it would be poisonous to all living things. H 2 O or 'juvenile wate r' is sterile, distilled water and devoid of any so-called 'impurities'. It has no developed character and qualities. As a young, immature , growing entity, it grasps like a baby at everything within reach. It absorbs the characteristics and proper- ties of whatever it comes into contact w ith or has attracted to itself in order to grow to maturity. This 'everything' - the so-called 'impurities'- takes the form of trace elements, minerals, salt s and even smells! Were we to drink pure H 2 O constantly, it would qu ickly leach out all our store of minerals and trace elements, debilitating and ultimate ly killing us. Like a growing child, juvenile water takes and does not give. Only when mature, i.e. when suit- ably enriched with raw mate rials, is it in a position to give, to dispense itself freely and willingly, thus enabling the re st of life to devel op. Before the birth of water, there was no life. But what is this marvellous, colourle ss, tasteless and od ourless substance, which quenches our thirst like no other liquid? Did we but truly understand the essential nature of water - a living substance - we would not treat it so churlishly, but would care for it as if our lives depended on it, which undoubtedly they do. \"The Upholder of the Cycles which supports the whole of Life, is water. In every drop of water dwells the Godhead, whom we all serve; there also dwells Life, the Soul of the 'First' substance - Water - whose boundaries and banks are the capillar- ies that guide it and in which it circulates.\" \"More energy is encapsulated in every drop of good spring water than an aver- age-sized powerstation is presently able to produce. Indeed in accordance with the famous Hasenohrl-Einstein equation E = mc 2 , in 1 gram of substance, or 1 cubic centimetre of water, 25 million kilowatt hours of energy are stored! "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Water is a being that has l i f e and death. With incorrect, ignorant handling, however, it becomes diseased, imparting this condition to all other organisms, vegetable, animal and human alike, ca using their eventual physical decay and death, and in the case of human beings, th eir moral, mental and spiritual dete- rioration as well. From this it can be seen just how vital it is, that water should be handled and stored in such a way as to avert such pernicious repercussions. \"Science views the blood-building and character-influencing ur-organism 1 - 'water' merely as a chemical compound and provides millions of people with a liquid prepared from this point of view, which is everything but healthy water.\" But what does modern, de-naturised ci vilisation care, as long as it receives a suitably hygienised, clear liquid to shower, wash its dishes, clothes and cars. Once down the plug-hole in company with all manner of toxic chemicals and detergents, all is comfortingly out of sight and out of mind. \"Our primeval Mother Earth is an organism that no science in the world can rationalise. Everything on her that crawls and flies is dependent upon Her and all must hopelessly perish if that Earth dies that feeds us.\" Although the chlorination of drinking and household water-supplies osten- sibly removes the threat of water-borne diseases, it does so, however, to the detriment of the consumer. In its functi on of water steriliser or disinfectant, chlorine eradicates all types of bacteria, beneficial and harmful alike. More importantly, however, it also disinfec ts the blood (about 80% water) or sap (ditto) and in doing so kills off or seriously weakens many of the immunity- enhancing micro-organisms resident in the body of those constantly forced to consume it. This eventually impairs their immune systems to such a degree that they are no longer able to eject viruses, germs and cancer cells, to which the respective host- bodies ultimately falls victim. l In Viktor Schauberger's writings in German, the 'of first principle', come to mind, which further prefix 'Ur' is often separated from the rest of the encompass such meanings as: - pertaining to the word by a hyphen, e.g. 'Ur-sache' in lieu of first age of the world, or of anything ancient; - 'Ursache', when normally it would be joined. By pertaining to or existing from the earliest begin- this he intends to place a particular emphasis on nings;- cons tituting the earliest beginning or the prefix, thus endowing it with a more pro- starting point;- from which something else is found meaning than the merely superficial. This derived, developed or depends;- applying to prefix belongs not only to the German language, parts or structures in their earliest or rudimentary but in former times also to the English, a usage stage; - the first or earliest formed in the course of which has now lapsed. According to the Oxford growth. To this can be added the concept of an English Dictionary, 'ur' denotes 'primitive', 'orig- 'ur-condition' or 'ur-state' of extremely high inal', 'earliest', giving such examples as 'ur- potential or potency, a latent evolutionary Shakespeare' or 'ur-origin'. This begins to get to ripeness, which given the correct impulse can the root of Viktor's use of it and the deeper sig- unloose all of Nature's innate creative forces. In nificance he placed upon it. If one expands upon the English text, therefore, the prefix 'ur' will also the interpretation given in the Oxford English be us ed wherever it occurs in the original Dictionary, then the concepts of 'primordial', German and the reader is asked to bear the above 'primeval', 'primal', 'fundamental', 'elementary' , in mind when reading what follows. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The appearance of AIDS, therefore/ and the enormous increase in all forms of disease, cancer in partcular, would have come as no surprise to Viktor Schauberger. Apart from the other inevitable disturbances to the ecol- ogy and the environment occasioned by humanity's unthinking activities, he foresaw it a l l as early as 1933. \"For a person who lives 100 years in the future, the present comes as no sur- prise.\" Apart from other factors (some ca nnot be defined quantitatively), encom- passing such aspects as turbidity (opaqueness), impurity, and quality, the most crucial factor affect ing the health and energy of water is temperature. As a liquid, the behaviour of water diff ers from all other fluids. The latter become consistently and steadily denser with cooling, water reaches its dens- est state at a temperature of +4°C (+39.2°F), below wh ich it grows less dense. In contrast, water's behaviour is anom alous, because it reaches its greatest density at a temperature of +4°C (+39.2°F). This is the so-called 'anomaly point', or the point of water's anomalous expansion, which is decisive in this regard and has a major influence on its quality. Below this temperature it Once more expands. This highest state of density is synonymous with its highest energy content, a factor to be taken carefully into account, since ener- gy can also be equated with life or life-force. Therefore if water's health, energy and life-force are to be maintained at the highest possible level, then certain precautions must be taken, which will be addressed later. Conceived in the cool, dark cradle of the virgin forest, water ripens and matures as it slowly mounts from the depths. On its upward way it gathers to itself trace elements and minerals. Only when it is ripe, and not before, will it emerge from the womb of the Earth as a spring. As a true spring, in contrast to a seepage spring, this has a water temperature of about +4°C (+39.2°F). Here in the cool, diffused li ght of the forest it begins its long, life-giving cycle as a sparkling, lively, translucent stream, bubbling, gurgling, whirling and gyrating as it wends its way valleywards. In its natural, self-cooling, spi- ralling, convoluting motion, wa ter is able to maintain its vita l inner energies, health and purity. In this way it acts as th e conveyor of all th e necessary min- erals, trace elements and other subtle energies to the surrounding environ- ment. Naturally flowing water seeks to fl ow in darkness or in the diffused light of the forest, thus avoiding the damaging direct light of the sun. Under these conditions, even when cascading do wn in torrents, a stream will only rarely overflow its banks. Due to its correct natural motion, the faster it flows, the greater its carrying ca pacity and scouring ability and the more it deepens its bed. This is due to the formation of in-windin g, longitudinal, clockwise - anti-clockwise alternating sp iral vortices down the central axis of the current, which constantly cool and re-cool the water, maintain ing it at a healthy tem- perature and leading to a faster , more laminar, spiral flow. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"To protect itself from harmful effects of excess heat, water shields itself from the Sun with over-hanging vegetation, fo r with increasing heat and light it begins to lose its vitality and health , its capacity to enliv en and animate the environment through which it passes. Ultimately beco ming a broad river, the water becomes more turbi d, the content of small-grain sediment and silt increasing as it warms up, its flow becoming slow er and more sluggish. However, even this turbidity plays an important role, because it protects the deeper water-strata from th e heating effect of the sun. Being in a denser state, the colder bottom-strata retain the power to shift sediment of larger grain-size (pebbles, gravel, etc.) from the centre of the watercourse. In this way the dan- ger of flooding is reduced to a mini mum. The spiral, vor tical motion men- tioned earlier, which eventually led Vikt or Schauberger to the formation of his theories concerning 'implosion', create s the conditions, where the germina- tion of harmful bacteria is inhibited and the water remains disease-free. Another of its life-giving properties is its high specific heat - lowest at +37.5°C (+99.5°F). The term \"specific heat \" refers to the capacity and rapidi- ty of a body to abso rb or release heat. With a re latively small input of heat fluids with a high specifi c heat warm up less rapi dly than those with a lower specific heat. How strange then, and how remarkable, that the lowest specific heat of this \"inorganic\" su bstance - water - lies but 0.5°C (0.9°F) above the normal +37°C (+98.6°F) bl ood temperature of the most highly evolved of Nature's creatures - human beings. This property of water to resist rapid thermal change enables us , with blood compos ed of 80% water, to survive under large variations of te mperature. Pure accident so we are told, or is it by clever, sy mbiotic design?! However, we are used to thinking about temperature in gross terms (car engines operate at temperatures of l,000°C (l,832°F) or so and many industrial processes employ extremely high temperatures). Despite the fact that we begin to feel unwell if our tem- perature rises by as little as 0.5°C (0.9°F), we fail to see that non-mechanical, organic life and health are based on very subtle differences in temperature. When our body temperature is +37°C (98.6°F) we do not have a 'temperature' as such. We are healthy and in a state that Viktor Schauberg er called 'indiffer- ent' or 'temperature-less'. Just as good water is the preserver of our proper bodily temperature, our anomaly point of greatest health a nd energy, so too does it preserve this planet as a habitat for our continuing existence. Water has the capacity to retain large amounts of heat and were there no water vapour in the atmosphere, this world of ours would be an icy-cold, barren wasteland. Water in all its forms and qualities is thus the mediator of all life and deserving of the high est focus of our esteem. \"To Be or Not to Be: In Nature all life is a question of the minutest, but extremely precisely graduated differences in the par ticular thermal motion within every single body, which continually changes in rhyt hm with the processes of pulsation.\" "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"\"This unique law, which manife sts itself throughout Nature's fastness and unity and expresses in every creature and organism, is the law of ceaseless cycles' that in every organism is linked to a certain time span and a particular tempo.\" \"The slightest disturbance of this harmony can lead to the most disastrous conse- quences for the major life forms.\" \" I n order to preserve this state of equilibrium, it is vital that the characteristic inner temperature of each of the milli ons of micro-organisms contained in the macro-organisms be maintained.\" The No. 1 enemy of water is excess heat or over-exposure to the Sun's rays. It is a well-known fact that oxygen is present in all processes of organic growth and decay. Whether its energies are harnessed for either one or the other is to a very great extent, if not wholly, dependent on the temperature of the water as itself or in th e form of blood or sap. As long as the water- temperature is below +9°C (+48.2°F), its oxygen content remains passive. Under such conditions the oxygen assist s in the building up of beneficial, high-grade micro-organisms and other or ganic life. Howeve r, if the water temperature rises above this level, then the oxygen becomes increasingly active and aggressive. This aggressive ness increases as the temperature rises, promoting the propagation of pathogenic bacter ia, which, when drunk with the water, infest the organism of the drinker. \"Thus the development of micro-organisms and the opportunities for their propaga- tion are simply a result of the condition in which the respective sickening macro-organ- ism finds itself, which will be attacked by these parasites and which eventually must fall victim to them if its inner climatic conditions are no longer strictly regulated.\" But this aggressiveness is not confin ed to the domain of oxygen alone. When water becomes over-heated, due pr incipally to the increasingly wide- spread clear-felling of the forest, the health-maintaining pattern of longitu- dinal vortices changes into transver se ones. These not only undermine and gouge into the rive rbanks and embankment work s, eventually bursting them, but also create pot-holes in the ri verbed itself, bringing even greater disorder to an already chaotic channel-profile. According to Viktor Schauberger, wa ter subjected to these conditions loses its character, its soul. Like humans of low character, it becomes increasingly violent and aggressive as it casts about hither and thither seek- ing to vent its anger and restore to itself its fo rmer health and stability. However, due to the senseless malpractice of the clear-felling of forests, we are destroying the very foundation of life. For with th e removal of the forest, two very serious things happen: 1). During its flow to the sea, the wa ter warms up prematurely to such an extent that it is warmed right down to the channel-bed. No cool, dense, water-strata remain and the sediment is left lying on the bottom. This "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"blocks the flow, dislocates the channel and results in the inevitable/ often catastrophic floods. Yet we still have the effrontery to call these awe- some events 'natural disasters', as if Nature herself were responsible. Furthermore, due to the broadening of the channel, even more water is exposed to the Sun's heat, resulting in over-rapid evaporation to the atmosphere. In many cases this overloads the atmosphere with water- vapour, which it is unable to retain in suspension. Deluges follow. 2). With the forest-cover now removed, the ground also begins to heat up to temperatures much higher than normal and natural. Dry soil heats up as much as five times faster than water. This has a two-fold effect: a). The rejection and repulsion by the warmer soil of any incident rain- water, whose temperature in this case is generally lower. Cold rain will not readily infiltrate into warm soil. This results in rapid surface run-off and no groundwater recharge. The soil dries out. b). An increase in pathogenic micr obial activity, harmful to plant life. The upshot of all this is more fl ooding, reduced groundwater quantity and lower groundwater table. One flood therefore begets the next in rapid succession. But since there is no grou ndwater recharge, the water-balance and natural distribution are comple tely upset. The re maining trees - the vital retainers of water - die, leaving th e land barren and desiccated with the necessary sequel of drought. The less th e tree-cover, the more extensive the flooding and the longer the period of drought, of water-lessness, which is synonymous with life-lessness ! Unnatural, quantity-inspired forestry practices, ignorant of Nature's laws, and the over-warming of the soil arisi ng from massive deforestation are the primary causes of the deterioration in water quality, climate and the sinking of the water table. The channelling of water through straight, unnaturally constructed, trapezoid canals, steel pipelines and other misguided systems of river regulation also force the water to move in an unnatural way and accelerate its degenera tion and increase its disease-carrying capacity. All around us we see the bridges of life collapsing, those capillaries which create all organic life. This dreadful disintegration has been caused by the mindless and mechanical work of man, who has wrenched the living soul from the Earth's blood - water. \"The more the engineer endeavours to channel water, of whose spirit and nature he is today still ignorant, by the shortest and strai ghtest route to the sea, the more the flow of water weighs into the bends, the longer its path and the worse the water will become. \"The spreading of the most terrible disease of all, of cancer, is the necessary conse- quence of such unnatural regulatory works. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"These mistaken activities - out work - must legitimately lead to increasingly widespread unemployment, because out pres ent methods oj working, which have a purely mechannical basis, are already destroying not only all of wise Nature's forma- five processes, but first and foremost the growth of the vegetation itself, which is being destroyed even as it grows. The drying up of mountain springs, the change in the whole pattern of motion of the groundwater, and the disturbance in the blood circulation of the organism- Earth - is the direct result of modern forestry practices. \"The pulsebeat of the Earth was factuall y arrested by the modern timber produc- tion industry. \"Every economic death of a people is always preceded by the death of its forests. \"The forest is the habitat of water and as such the habitat of life processes too, whose quality declines as the organic development of the forest is disturbed. \"Ultimately, due to a law which functio ns with awesome constancy, it will slow- ly but surely come around to our turn. \"Our accustomed way of thinking in many ways, and perhaps even without exception, is opposed to the true workings of Nature. \"Our work is the embodiment of our will. The spiritual manifestation of this work is its effect. When such work is carri ed out correctly, it brings happiness, but when carried out incorrectly, it assuredly brings misery.\" There is only one solution! Would we li ve and ensure a sustainable future then we must plant trees for our very lives, but far more importantly, we have a duty to do it for those of our children. More immediately, however, we must care for the very limited stocks of water still available. This means trea ting it in the way demonstrated to us by Nature. First and foremost, water s hould be protected from sunlight and kept in the dark, far removed from all sources of heat, light and atmospheric influences. Ideally it should be place d in opaque, porous containers, which on the one hand cut out all direct light and heat, and on the other, allow the water to breathe, which in common with all other living things, it must do in order to stay a live and healthy. In terms of what we can achieve personal- ly, we should at all times ensure that our storage vessels, tanks, etc., are thoroughly insulated, so that the c ontained water is maintained at the coolest temperature possible under the prevailing conditions. The materials most suited to this are na tural stone, timber (woode n barrels) and terracotta. Perhaps more than any other material, terracotta has been used for this pur- pose for millennia. Terracotta exhibits a porosity particularly well-suited to purposes of water storage. This is becau se it enables a very small percentage of the contained water to evaporate via the vessel walls. Evaporation is always associated with cooling (v aporisation, however, with heat) and, according to Walter Schauberger (Viktor' s physicist son), if the porosity is correct, then for every 6 00th part of the contents evaporated, the contents "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"will be cooled by 1°C (1.8°F), thus approaching a temperature of +4°C (+39.2°F). While the material for the construction of a water-storage vessel has been described above, another important factor is the actual shape of the contain- er itself. Most of the storage contai ners commonly in use today take the form of cubes, rectangular volumes of one form or another, or cylinders. While these are the shapes most easily and economically produced by today's technology, they do have certain drawbacks in terms of impeding natural water circulation and water suffocation. Due to their rectangular shape and/or right-angled corners, cert ain stagnant zones are created, con- ducive to the formation of pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, since the materi- als used are generally galvanised iron, fibre glass, concrete, etc., i.e. all impervious materials, the contained water is unable to breathe adequately and suffocates as a result. In this debilitated state or as a water-corpse, it is no longer either healthy or health-giving and may require further disinfec- tion. Should we now make a study of those shapes that Nature chooses to propagate and maintain life, it soon becomes apparent that the cubes and cylinders mentioned above have no pl ace in Nature's scheme of things. Instead, eggs and elongated egg-shapes such as grains and seeds are employed, presumably because Nature in her wisdom has determined that these produce the optimal results. Historically speaking, it is evident that earlier civilisations such as the Egyp tians and Greeks, renowned for their logic and construction al ability, were well aware of this, because they stored their grains and liquids (oils, wines, etc.) in terracotta amphorae, sealed with beeswax. All this desp ite the fact that for all rational, practical purpos- es, the shape was wholly unsuited to co mpact and efficient storage in terms of space and ease of handling. It is obvi ous that the selection of this form over any other was intentional and as th e result of certain knowledge of the long-term storage properties of such shapes. In many amphorae that have surfaced in archaeological excavations over the last 100 years or so, grains of wheat have been found that were still viable and even after storage over 2,000 years, grew when planted. This f act alone should suffice to affirm the efficacy of the properties of vessels of such shape. Taking Viktor Schauberger's exhortation, Comprehend and copy Nature! as our guide, we should therefore make us e of the shapes that Nature herself selects to contain, guard and maintain life, i.e. eggs an d their derivations. Compared with cubes and cylinders , these shapes have no stagnant zones, no right-angled corners that i nhibit flowing movement. By placing our terracotta vessels in shaded areas, exposed to air movement, the evapo- rative cooling effect will be signifi cantly enhanced and since all natural movement of liquids and gases is tr iggered by differences in temperature, "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"so too inside the egg-shaped storage vessel, cyclical, spiral, vitalisi ng move- ment of the water will be induced. Movement is an expressi on of energy and energy is synonymous with life. The external evaporation causes cooli ng of the outer walls and the water in their immediate vicinity. Being cooler and therefore denser, this water becomes specifically heavier and sinks down along the walls towards the bottom at the same time forcing the wa ter there to rise up the centre and move towards the outside walls. Continual repetition of this process results in the constant circulation and cooling of the contents. Having discussed the above 'ideal' stor age vessel and in view of the fact that they are presently not availabl e on the market, it would be a sorry o mission, if methods of improving existi ng installations were not also addressed. The main factor to be taken into account here is that of exposure to light and heat. Where possible, all above-ground water tanks, whether of gal- vanised iron, fibre-glass or concrete, should be insulated on all sides and external surfaces through the applicat ion of sprayed foam or equivalent thermal barrier to a minimum thickness of 75mm. If not already white or of a light, heat-reflecting colour, then it should be so painted. For in-ground tanks, the top surface only need be insulated and rendered white in colour. For many people dams or rivers provi de the main source of water and certain simple measures can be taken to improve the quality of the water obtained from them. Providing the surrounding soil is not impervious to water, a hole of suitable dimension, depth and capacity (say 1, 000 - 2,000 litres) should be dug about 5 -10 metres from the banks of the dam or river. If possible th e depth should be equal to the depth of the latter. Wells dug next to dams should be situated above the highest water level. If the consistency of the soil is permeable enough, then water will percolate thr ough the intervening soil and into the newly excavated well. De pending on the st ability and load-bearing capacity of the soil (a structural e ngineer should be consulte d it there is any doubt), a small concrete, perimeter footing should be placed at a safe and stable dis- tance from the rim of the well. When the concrete has cured and set firmly, then a minimum of 1 course of blocks sh ould be laid to pr event the entry of any surface water. In the case of wells ne xt to rivers, howeve r, it may be nec- essary to raise the height of the blockwork to just above the average height of flood waters to prevent contaminatio n of the well water during floods. The well should then be to tally enclosed and sealed with a well-insulated timber and sheet-metal roof, or a concre te slab, and provided with an access hatch to service the pump and/or suct ion pipe and foot-v alve. Preferably the pump should be located outside th e well-space to avoid any possible oil pollution, etc. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The reason for having the 1,000 - 2,000 litre storage capacity mentioned earlier, is that it may only be possible to pump water inte rmittently, because the rate of replenishment from the ma in water source may be fairly slow, depending on the perm eability of the soil. In the event that the soil surrounding a dam or a river is impervious, then it would be necessary to excavate a channel about 600 mm wide between the well and the main water body. The lo wer part of this should be filled with clean, quartz sand to a depth of about 600 mm and the upper part back-filled with the excavated material and compacted. As the water perco- lates through either the existing soil or the emplaced sand most suspended matter will be filtered out. Also, because the water comes into the well at the lowest level from the main water source it will be as cool as possible under the prevailing conditions. In this state it is less likely to harbour harmful, pathogenic bacteria, which tend to populate the upper, more highly oxy- genated strata of th e main water body. The use of this technique on the author's own property produced an extremely clear, clean, o dourless and good tast ing water. Desp ite all outward appearances, however, it is still advisable to have such water tested by the responsible authorities for quality, pu rity and any possible contaminants. In terms of its mineral, salt and trace-element c ontent, river-water would generally be far richer than tank-wate r (rainwater). As fo r the immature and mature water discussed at the beginni ng, in most cases it would be neces- sary to supplement the mineral content of rainwater, if this is the only source of drinking water, in order to pr event the extraction of these from the body of the drinker. Here the suspensi on of an artificial-fibre sack (rot- proof) containing the dust of crushed basalt or other igneous rock used for road building (commonly known as 'c rusher dust') would do much to enhance the composition of the tank water, because it will hungrily absorb those elements it requires to become mature. However, before adding any crusher dust to the water, it would be again advisable to test the resulting change in the quality by analysing the difference between two samples of tank water, one with crusher-dust added and one without as a control. Both samples should th en be placed in a cool, dark place and left for at least a week before analysis of the mineral content, bacterial purity, etc. is carried out. This sh ould be done by a su itably qualified specialist. These suggestions for improving water quality are the result of my per- sonal experience and understanding of Viktor Schauberger's pioneering dis- coveries and theories. Viktor Schauberger's great dictum, frequently asserted, was C 2 - Comprehend & Copy Nature, for it was only thus that humanity could emerge from its present crisis-str icken condition. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"They call me deranged, the hope is that they are right! it is of no greater or lesser import for yet an other fool to wander this Earth. But if I am right and science is wrong, then may th e Lord God have mercy on mankind! Indeed at the Stuttgart University of Technology, West Germany in 1952 these theories were tested under strict sc ientific and labo ratory conditions by Professor Dr. Ing. Fran z Popel, a hydraulics specialist. These tests s howed that, when water is allowed to flow in its naturally ordained man- ner, it actually generates certain energi es, ultimately achieving a condition that could be termed 'negative friction'. Checked and double-checked, t h i s well-documented, but largely unpublicis ed, pioneering discovery not only vindicated Viktor Schauberg er's theories. It also over-turned the hitherto scientifically sacred 'Second Law of Thermodynamics' in which, without further or continuous input of energy, all (closed) systems must degenerate into a condition of total chaos or entropy . These experiments proved that this law, whilst it applies to all mechani cal systems, does not apply wholly to living organisms. As a result of these discoveries, it wa s arranged that Viktor Schauberger be taken to the United States in 1958, where sums amoun ting potentially to many millions of dollars could be made available as start-capital for a Los Alamos-like venture to develop Viktor Schauberger's theories of Implosion. He was accompanied by his son, Walter Sc hauberger, a physicist and mathe- matician, to assist in the scientific in terpretation of his father's theories. Soon after arrival, howe ver, various misundersta ndings developed, too complex to elaborate here , whereupon Viktor Schauberger fell silent and refused to participate. After some th ree months of silence the project was abandoned. Viktor and Walter Schauberger were then permi tted to return to Austria, where Viktor died in Linz some five days la ter on the 25th September 1958, a very disillusioned man. On their return journey, Viktor aske d Walter to translate his theories of Implosion into terms of physics, geometry and mathematics, in such man- ner that their veracity was irrefutabl e. Because Viktor Schauberger's con- cepts broke new ground, this presen ted some difficulty. There was no adequate scientific terminology to de scribe them, nor was there any mathe- matical basis from which the necessary shapes could be precisely defined or constructed. With his own devices and apparatuses, Viktor Schauberger had also encountered problems of constructi on, which in part affected the opti- mum functioning of these machines, beca use the state and sophistication of the technology then available was inad equate and too cumbersome to build them properly and accurately.

Dri v e n by the increasing urgency of making these fateful errors known to the public, he wrote The Nature of Water and a number of other sections in this book between 1932 and 1933. These were originally published in a two-part book enti- tled Our Senseless Toil - the Cause of the World Crisis. For Viktor, the publication of this, the largest of his individual wo rks, became imperative due to the untimely death in 1931 of Professor Philipp Forchh eimer. Forchheimer was a hydrologist of world repute who sponsored the publication of a series of Viktor's treatises on all aspects of water in Die Wasserwirtschaft, the Austrian Journal of Hydrology.

Standing at the highest level of evolution, and above al l being blessed with mind and reason, humanity constantly does the most idiotic thing imaginable by trying to regulate these waterways by means of their banks - by influencing the flow mechanically, instead of taking into account the fact that wate r is itself a living entity. The assumption behind this absurd practice is that the riverbank shapes the watercourse, whereas the riverbank is actually the secondary effect and water the primary. To regulate water by means of the riverbank is truly to fight cause with effect. It should be as inconceivable to a thinking engineer to reinforce the crumbling bank of a watercourse with rammed piles and brush-wood bales, or to smear over crack s with cement, as it would be for a doctor to patch up rupt ured capillaries with needle and thread. Astonishingly, though, it still happens! The condition of all our waterways demonstrates just where these measures have led. In not one single case has the desired object been attained - namely the achievement of a normal channel-profile. On the contrary, all such river reg- ulation has provoked further damage which far outweighs any local or short-term advantages. Large rivers su ch as the Danube, Rhine, Tagliamento, Etsch, Garonne and Mississippi bear witne ss to the failure of such complicat- ed and costly river regulations. Quit e apart from the tremendous damage caused in the lower reaches by their st rictly mechanical regulation, these rivers are stripped of thei r most valuable assets, th eir great physical qualities. The present dirty grey, muddy brew known as the Bl ue Danube, upon whose bed river-gold once gleamed, and the Rhine, the symbol of German identity, where Rhinegold fl ashed in bygone days, are tragic testimonials to these perverse practices. The mythical \"Gold of the Nibelungs\" originated in the golden glow given off by pebbles as they rubbed against each other while rolling along the riverbed at night - for when there is a decrease in water temperature, the tractive force 3 increases, causing the stones to move. If two pebbles are rubbed together under water, a golden glow appears. 4 This yellowish-red fiery glow used to be mistaken for the flashing of gold, thought to be lying on the bottom of the river. Today this \"river-gold\" lies heaped up in huge mounds of gravel, shifted hither and thither by the force of the sluggish and murky water-masses 5 flowing above them.

The flow of water down a natural gradient obeys a sublime, inner Law whose pow er our hydraulic experts are quite unable to comprehend. In the absence of this inner conformi ty with law, all flowing water ought to accelerate faster and faster until it ultimately trans- fers to a vaporous state. Science maintains that water is braked by internal and external friction, though it is well known that friction is associated with the generation of heat. However, it can be shown that the temperature of fast-flowing water decreases, which leads to an increas e in tractive force and internal friction. This simple observati on invalidates certain essential propo- sitions in the complex of curre nt hydro-mechanical theories. Where then is the real secret of st eadiness in the flow of draining water- masses? The force that brakes the flow of water down a gradient is a resis- tance which acts ag ainst the force of gravity, a circul ation of energy operating in the opposite direction to the current. This is also true of all metabolic processes and gives water its character and thus its soul. Contemporary systems of river regulation inhibit th is vital function. The logical outcome of this is the loss of water's inner braking power. The water becomes soulless, without character and therefore aggressive. Fig. 2: The confluence of the Tepl and the Eger.

Born e up by inner energies it emerges only when ripe - when it has achieved its proper p hysical composition and when it must leave the Earth. The absorbed ai r content of such water consists of about 96% gaseous, physica lly dissolved carbones. 6 As a result the psyche or the character of water can be described as being of very high calibre."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"There are some springs which exhibit such a high content of carbonic acid (this expression is in any case incorrect ) that when small animals inhale the vapour from it in the surrounding atmos phere they die almost instantly - the Dog Spring in Naples being an example. 7 This water is also dangerous for people who suck it into their mouths directly fro m the spring, and inhale its rising gases at the sa me time. Mountain folk call such springs 'poisonous water'. Today springs can still be fo und which people avoid and which are fenced off to prevent access by grazing cattle. According to folklore these springs are inhabited by 'Waterworm' which, if swallowed, irrevocably cause death within a few da ys. If a metal container is filled with such water and placed in the open air, the water heats up inordinately quickly, display- ing a slight effervescence at the surface. Incidentally this phenomenon also sometimes happens when wells are bored . Whenever these events occur, the exposed water quickly subsides and the well is soon dry. When such water is exposed to the ai r, the emergence of an abundan ce of bacterial life is soon observed. The warmer the water become s, the less complex and the more primitive the bacteria. If warmed-up rainwater is poured into this water, a few drops of oil are added and the whole container sealed, the contents of the container will very soon explode. What has happened here? The negative atmosphere, the psyche contained in the high-grade springwat er oxidises. It interacts with warm, heavily-oxy- genated and consequently predominantly positively-charged air. When this interactive expansion encounters an obstacle and when a high-grade car- bone is present - for example, in the fo rm of oil - it sha tters the container. If such water is drunk quickly when the body is hot, the same phenome- non occurs in the body of the drinker. The affected person feels a stabbing pain in the lungs and dies within a few days. Alpine farmers describe this rapid sickening as the 'vanishing lu ng disease' (galloping consumption). If such cases are less frequent today than in earlier times, th is is only because such high-grade water is now rarely found.

The longer the water is exposed to the influence oi light and the more it comes into contact with the air during fl ow or through mechanical motion (stirring action), the more it will relinquish its former geospheric characteristics, 8 absorb those of the atmosphere and become warm, stale and insipid. The more immature (juvenile) th e water emerging from seepage springs or otherwise extracted from the ground, and the smaller the difference bet ween contrasting magnitudes origina lly present, the weaker will be the interactions. The more inferior the quality of the products of this energy- exchange, the less complex are the micro-orga nisms which evolve. This nec- essarily results in the mental and physical degeneration of all those organisms that use this low-quality wate r in order to function. If the vitally important oxidising processes can no l onger occur in an appropriate high- grade form, it is unreasonable to expect to find high-grade properties and processes continuing in water that is no longer able to maintain its inner ripeness or has lost its previously matu re characteristics. It should therefore come as no surprise if, in such water, a variety of more primitive life-forms come into existence whic h ultimately pose a threat even to human life. Whereas an initial supply of oxygen was necessar y for the emergence and development of these organi sms, an excessive concen tration of oxygen or an over-supply of a lower-grade oxygen would tend to be fatal to them. The same sort of thing happens to us. If we wish to visit the sphere of oxygen, the stratosphere, we must take with us oxygen of the same composition nor- mally encountered in our own sphere. Th e same holds true for the supply of fresh water on ocean voyages. If excessi ve quantities of oxygen are injected into water then, in the long run, such water can support neither bacterium nor human being. Since the bacterium has no other way to breathe it must die immediately - whereas the human be ing, who at least still has a chance to gulp down some healthy air, peri shes only in the course of time. The body's metabolic processes are dependent on a specific composition of basic elements - the carbone an d oxygen groups contained in water. Similarly, the development of qualitatively high-grade vegetation is depen- dent upon there being a particular ra tio between the quantities and qualities of these substances in the basic form ative substance - water. These quanti- ties and qualities generate a particular internal temperature appropriate to each organism in which they are ta ken up (whether by breathing, through the consumption of food or the direct supply of water) as a result of the interactions occurring during thes e reciprocal oxidising processes. 8 The actual expression here is 'Earthsphere'. and energetic characteristics inhering in any Where Viktor Schauberger uses the word given sphere, be it the hydrosphere, geosphere, 'sphere' in this context, this denotes the collec- biosphere, atmosphere, etc. - Ed. tive embodiment of all the physical, material "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"A particular Inner temperature produces a certain physical form which in turn generates the sp ecial kind of immaterial energy we encounter as char- acter.

Once this stage has been reached, the whole begins to grow sponta- neously. All it depends on is the proper preparation. The phenomena and processes of tr ansmutation which arise from differ- ences in energy potential and produce water- eggs, permeate and animate the remaining substances. Being in a less organised state, the latter would nev er experience their transformation into an organically higher form of l i f e i f t h ey did not actually force the juve nile or virgin water to carry out pur- pos eful work before their ascension. It is these substances that lift the water up and not the water that raises them. Precisely the reverse takes place in the high atmosphere, where it is the juvenile water in this case that forces the very buoyant substances to conduct the water ur-procreated in the atmosphere gently back to Earth. In ot her words, the juvenile water ensures that the heavenly substances imbued w ith mechanical levitative energies are continuously returned to Earth in order to assist other substances to reach higher regions and levels of evolvement . Thus in Nature mechanical pres- sure and physical suction ar e always in a condition of rhythmical alterna- tion, which is why there is no state of rest in this world, for the relation between pressure and suction is always in the ratio of 2 : 3. This concept is so simple that it requires a certain finesse not to reveal too much, because it would be absolutely no blessing to huma nity, if with its present attitudes it was suddenly given control over these elemental forces. The most important precondition fo r the production of water is the \"angle\", for through it the feelings find their expression, such as happens with laughter. Without pulling the angl es of the mouth, laughing would be impossible. \"°u°\" or \"°n°\". This angle is a \"oneness \" in a monolinear plane, infinite and very similar to \"oo\". This infinite plane is what we describe as \"time\". All we have to do is to create organic loops 10 in order to produce water-eggs and from them the water itself, which on its part then cr eates the spaces for nutritive material. These water-eggs are even sometimes vi sible to the naked eye, because we are here concerned with products of th e anomaly point (for water = +4°C), which are incubated with cold instead of heat. Once such a process of incu- bation 11 has begun, then the heat is dissip ated in the water, because all processes of growth require heat. This is why rivers that cool themselves as they flow increase their tractive force and carry th e \"naughty\" stones, which lie so heavily in the stomachs of river regulators, far out into the seas and create new land. In the opposite case, they create water-deserts. Protein Formation: This can appear in many different shapes and sizes. Protein is in the earth in a solid state, in water in a liquid state and in air in a 10 Organic loops may perhaps take the form of which has one face and one edge - Ed. figures-of-eight or be akin to the Moebius strip, \"in-cube-ation = turn into 3 dimensions. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"gaseous state. In all cases these ar e manifestations of concentration or ur- combination. We thus come face to face with the proce sses of Mr-procreation. Solid, liquid and gaseous are three spacial states. If by means of the appropriate angle, we concentrate th e ethereal elements or ethericities 12 into a suitably dosed mixture of the three grou ps of substances, then we are pre- sented with the natural formation of protein. In order that the process should produce the desired effect , it is very important th at we pay strict atten- tion to the different properties of the tensions existing between water and air. Therefore we have to organise pressure and suction in the proper directional- ly alternating rhythm, which from a physic al point of view are actually forms of heat and cold. This is enough to produce any de sired quantity of protein artificially, but in the way that it happen s in Nature. In this way proteinic sub- stances can be produced in their solid, liquid or gaseous ur-form. Consequently there are also wate r-eggs, air-eggs and earth-eggs. • Air-eggs produce water. • Water-eggs produce earth. • Earth-eggs produce energy-eggs (dynagens). With these energy-eggs we are thus presented with the possibility of produc- ing a flowing movement of energy. Space- energy propulsion, which is actual- ly within the constitution of such eggs , is therefore alrea dy within our grasp. These energy-eggs are themselves nour ished by the substances of the air; that is, a vacuum is formed when we set this process in motion. This vacu- um, however, is totally di fferent from the \"nothing\" that science seeks to describe as a zero. Those entities or ma gnitudes hitherto considered to be virtual or marginal will become th e actual causes from which can be derived not only any desired equivalent factor, but also significant elemen- tal forces as well, once the dosing and organisation of these dangerous opposites is underst ood and they are br ought into a rhythm ically oscillating motion. Since pressure and suction are constantly in an opposing mechani- cal and physical state of unstable equilib rium, then all we have to do is to organise the rhythm. We are thus presen ted with ceaseless motion that con- stantly increases. This is a mystical phenomenon, today qu ite inconceivable, but which nevertheless is what the natural motion we can see and detect all around us. 12 Ethericities: This term refers to those supra- dynagens, which respectively represent those normal, near non-dimensional, energetic, bio- s ubtle energies, whose f unction is the enhance- electric, bio-magnetic, catalytic, high-frequency, me nt of fructification (fructigens), the genera- vibratory, super-potent entities of quasi-materi- tion of quality (qualigens) and the amplification al, quasi-etheric nature belonging to the 4th and of immaterial energy (dynagens).

For every 1°C that water is cooled, the volume of its contained gases is reduced by 1/273rd. Cooling water tran sforms its gases into volume-less substances. This juvenile energy dissolves metallic and mineral solids, through which heat becomes bound, which in turn absorbs the heavy oxy- gen. The carbone content of winter-wat er is minimal and hence there is little absorption of oxygen. On the other ha nd, winter-water also becomes lighter and absorbs atmospheric gases, when for lack of suitable minerals, it cannot obtain carbonic acid from the earth. Springwater high in car bones does not even freeze at -32°C. Such water takes up oxygen in summer and becomes colder und er high external tem- peratures. Under certain circumstances carbon-dioxide is heavier than both air and water, whereas oxyg en under certain conditi ons is lighte r than air and heavier than water. The underlying cau se of this remarkable variation in weight is the degree of excitation of the gas. This is why the weight of water constantly changes, and it is im portant to differentiate between spe- ci fic and absolute variations in weight. The higher the water rises in the spring-conduit, the heavier the mine rals it precipitates. The more it unbur- dens itself, the denser it becomes and the more ea sily it rises. Water is energetically discharged by iron grilles and in turbines. That is to say, it loses its dynagens, becomes un ipolar and in the lower reaches replaces its lost dynagens from the su rrounding soil. This is why such water destroys its channel. The water becomes an animalistic magnet as it were, a nd in eviscerating the soil of its dynagens it also rips soil-particles away. In winter the water attracts aeriform subs tances, because it is element-hungry. In this high state of tension, howeve r, it is unable to metabolise them and therefore becomes lighter. On the other hand the atmosphere can also attract water if the water is terrestrially overcharged. When vap our rises under conditions of extreme cold, however, this is conditioned by th e water's inner atomic charge. • Water changes its boiling and freezing points according to its inner state of tension. • Water is no lifeless mass, but th e blood of the Earth, which comes into being and disappears through energetic interactions. • Trees synthesise water.

The formation of sap is also the result of radiation and thus has nothing to do with any mechanical suctional or pressu ral activity. The same is true for our blood circulation and the upwelling of springwater. If water is devoid of inne r atomic energies it is un able to rise.

High-Frequency Water [From Implosion Magazine No. 24.] Implosion is a quarterly magazine, originally published from about 1958 by Aloys Kokaly. Kokaly's association with Vikt or Schauberger began in 1940, when he manufactured certain components in Germany for Viktor's so-called 'flying machines'. These, according to Viktor's physicist son, Walter, were smuggled into Austria where they could neither be obtain ed nor manufactured. This fairly close association continued right through the wa r and up to Viktor Schauberger's death in 1958. Shortly thereafter Kokaly founde Verein zur Forderung der Biotechnik e.V. (Association for the Advancem ent of Biotechnology) specifically for the research and evaluation of Viktor's theories and disc overies. In an effort to reach an even wider audience, conferences and semin ars were held annually at the Association's headquarters in Neviges, Wuppertal. Implosion was published in order to provide a platform for Viktor and Walter Schauberger 's various writings, of which Kokaly had many originals. - [Editor] Throughout the world hunger will be constantly on the increase and is the result of the improper conduction and c onservation of water. Wherever peo- ple are hungry, a state of st rife must also exist. For this reason it is necessary to investigate the underlying causes to which peoples of ancient civilisa- tions owed their thriving vegetation, thei r several harvests a year, in short, their whole culture - a culture that ultimately perished, however, due to over-cultivation. In Nature two forces prevail: • gravitation - for expulsion and purging, • levitation - for upward impulsion and synthesis."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"In the struggle between the Ur-Feminine - the formative life-principle - and the fertilising, husband-like Ur-Masculine, cycloid motion plays a decisive role in determining whether a rise or fall in living standards results. The state of equilibrium between expulsive and im pulsive forces always remains constant. 13 If the weight of the organi sation of basic elements is reduced due to the disturbance of cy cloid motion, then it is a sign that the build-up of quality has also been distur bed - a build-up that is only possible with the aid of cycloid, oscillating motio n. If cycloid motion is fostered in draining water, then the growth of qualigen is increased. Higher-potency sub- stances or potentialities are built up. The ensuing increase in the growth of raw materials then acts as a counterweight to the intensified buoyant or lev- itative force, so that in all cases the la bile state of equilibrium is maintained. Between these two mutually self-compe nsating interactive forces - the up- building and down-grading - like a finger on the scales of Fate, which indi- cates the present state of well-being like a barometer, stands the current living standard. A decline in living standards is indica tive of the neglect of cycloid motion. Conversely, the standard of living ri ses immediately if the propagation of this form of motion, to which everything owes its material existence, is rein- stated. Without cycloid mo tion there can be no deve lopment of quality mat- ter and hence no purging of those substances too deficient or unsuitable for the purposes of higher evolution. Viewed naturalesquely, all growth and vegetation, indeed all manifesta- tions of life, are inferior energy-concen trates of raw materials or basic ele- ments. This becomes clearer if water, the 'first-bor n' or the first form of crystallising-out into matter, is view ed as a non-uniformly heavy carrier- substance. Seminal or fertilising matter, also known as oxygen, has a different type of charge and for this reason also has a different atomic weight to the stocks of oppositely-p otentiated fecund matter (hydrogen and carbones). Only through cycloid motion can the latter be transformed and built up into free potentiated entities. Only then is the consumption (bind- ing) of the seminal substances (oxygenes) by the real formative elements possible. The product of these transformative processes is high-frequency water. If the seminal elements, which react neither to pressure nor tension, bind the germinal substances, then heat is created. The water loses its original buoyant energies, becomes stale and inevitably degenerates. The enormous loss of formative energies can perhaps be estimated if one considers that when a large river is warmed by 0.1 °C per cubic metre, formative energies 13 This constancy is founded on the reciprocal rela tion between the two magnitudes of expulsion and impulsion. - Ed. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"are lost which correspond to a power equal to 42,700 kgm. 14 If this water, which due to the absence of cycloid mo tion has become warm and stale, is caused to move cycloidally on a trial basis, then it approaches the anomaly point of +4°C regardless of the Sun's influence. At this temperature ele- ments of carbonic acid bi nd elements of oxygen, a nd therefore the loss of fertilising substances is to the gain of the stocks of fecund matter now com- ing to life. Water thus conducted become s fresh, increases its carrying capac- ity and tractive force and surrenders its surplus formative energies to the surrounding soil. There the groundwater is immediately recharged, with the result that heat is extrac ted from the ground. This results in the build-up of the germination zone - the boundary zone between the positively-potentiat- ed atmosphere and the negatively-potentiated geosphere, which must be located within the vegetation root-zone - if these fecund elements are to develop further and be able to surrende r their surplus formative energies to root-protoplasms. It is the same pr ocess that occurs in the human body, where the normal build-up of blood can only take plac e at the organic anomaly point of between +36°C (96.8°F) and +37°C (98.6°F). If the blood temperature rises above +40°C (104°F) , then blood decom position sets in. Similarly, when the temperature of ri verwater rises significantly above its anomaly point, then all possible growth of vegetation ceases and it becomes dessicated and shrivelled. This also happens with th e lowering of the ground temperature in wint er, when the build-up of sap, the real accumula- tor of formative energi es, is de-activated. The pulsation of the blood improves its quality and facilitates its circula- tion. No circular motion is implied by the circulation cycle, but rather a gyration along a circular path. In its spiralling inward-and-outward oscilla- tion, it has an action similar to a clock spring. Through th is lively motion it is constantly shaken up , jostled and jolted, which enables the constant and continuous uptake of nutrients, water and air to be maintained. The more rhythmical the impulse-giving movement (as in certain physical exercises), the healthier the organism becomes. Due to this highly favourable move- ment, the inner pulsating dynamics of th e blood and, in a broader sense, the force of its spiritual potency is maintained. Therefore, when a river does its physi cal jerks and constantly sways from right to left and from left to right again, a strong renewal of water ensues, leading to the consumption of irradiat ed heat-producing matter, which then becomes bound, due to the vigorous growth of water and formative ener- gies. The oxygen becomes cool and inac tive, whereas the fecund elements become free and highly active. It is only in this way that the proper process of synthesis can take its normal course. 14 kgm: kilogram-metre [mechanical] = 1 kilowatt hour [kWh] = 36,700 kgm. In this case therefore 1.163 kWh. - Ed.

The river deepens its bed on the outer curves and raises its bed on the inner curves by sediment deposi tion on the warmer riverbank. As a result of this regulation the surface-dr aining bloodstream of the organism - Earth - is ejected from its developmenta l path both longitudinally and trans- versely, and in the process is thoroughly finished off. However, if we can picture a naturalesque river regulation, which incor- porates raised banks on the outer bends of the channel similar to those of a bob-sleigh run or a railway, then it becomes clear why such a water-course supplies the whole environment with high-grade, formative energies (see figs. 4 & 5). The channel for the water must be so arranged that, due to its momentum, the descending water over-falls or over-reaches itself and accel- erates towards the centre - the flow-axi s - in increasingly smaller spiralling whorls. This is where the centrally-transported, fertilising substances are concentrated, because they do not react to centripetence (see fig. 6). It is thus equally clear why female, fecund elemen ts are able to en snare male seminal elements and ultimately consume them entirely. In which case everything around begins to fl ourish and burst into blossom. Conversely, the fertility of the soil sinks all the more when, due to an unnatural form of flow, the straightened water, now no longer able to do its normal physical exercises, is mercilessly killed off.

The Natural Reconversion of Seawater into Fresh Water [From Implosion Magazine No. 101.] This discovery is founded on the realis ation that from a biological point of view there are two different kinds of mass motion and hence equally differ- ing forms of atomic energy - anima ting (propagating and upwardly evolv- ing, or multiplying and ennobling) as well as de-animating (retrogressive, repulsive and atavistic). Both types of motion operate simultaneously on a common developmental axis. The form of atomic energy that ultimately prevails depends on the type of impuls e that this rhythmical motive process imparts. The art of regulating this process was known and practised by the High Priests of ancient cultures, who knew how to order the eternal meta- morphic flow (Panta Rhei) in such a way that the demand for food and raw materials of a constantly increasi ng population could be satisfied. The untroubled continued growth at the time is to be ascribed to this regulatory skill. Lost thousands of years ago, this art was rediscovered through long years spent observing the motionless stan ce of the stationary trout amidst fast-flowing water and is now discussed: Growth-enhancing atomic energies ar ise when the media of earth, water and air (the carriers of stocks of bi-p olar basic elements) are made to move in a planetary manner. In this case it is possible to combine basic elements of opposite potential - solidifi ed solar energy, chemically described as oxygen - by means of the intrinsic valencies a nd properties of the sediments con- tained in water and air, if, under the total exclusion of light, heat and air, these media are caused to inwind and at the same time both stocks of basic elements are atomised and highly excite d by means of suitable catalysts. In this regard, however, care must be take n to ensure that retrogressive atomic forces only become free and active to the extent required to expel the waste matter left behind after the raw materials ha ve been reduced. As faecal mat- ter, they must be removed if unwelc ome accretions or decomposition of the above residues are not to occu r in the organism in question.

For all motion, they use devices, machines a nd conveyors whose back-to-front con- struction and fabrication wi th the wrong alloys foster s those atomic energies that inhibit evolutionary syntheses. Having unwittingly provoked a decline across the full spectrum of human development, it is therefore the acade- mics, who are to be regarded as the true inhibitors of evolution or as the long-sought instigators of cancer. It goes without saying that today's le aders of industry w ill find this asser- tion both outrageous and offensive. If one considers, ho wever, that as a direct result of the above mistakes in mass motion, thousand s of millions of their innocent fellow human beings have been robbed of their most funda- mental right to existence; that as a result of the lack of high-quality sub- stances they have become cancer-prone and are decaying alive, ultimately to die prematurely with unspeakable suffering - then no word is trenchant enough publicly to denounce this tr avesty of motion. \"Life-force\"can only be maintained th rough the supply of additional ani- mating energies. These become free and active when, like i ngested food, the earthly residues of life ha ve undergone a kind of digestive process. For this the original, planetary, movement of mass is required, which in the organ- ism of the Earth creates a counter-climate to that of the atmosphere, namely the state of indifference or the anomal y - for water +4°C, which has sover- eign power over the decisive \"to be or not to be\" interac tion between basic elements. The High Priests of ancient cultures were able to control this climate so skilfully that in all forms of life and gr owth they were able to maintain the so-called anomaly - temperaturelessne ss and feverlessness - the state of health as constant as possible. Vary ing from individual to individual, the respective life-form bears the hallm arks of its own particularity. Accordingly, whenever an individual b ecomes ill it is a sign that it is no longer able to maintain th is condition of indifference.

Just as no-one has hitherto succeeded in producing artifi cial seawater in which sea fish can survive, so is it also true that, apart fr om me, nobody has managed to create a nutri tive liquid, corr ectly constituted physiologically, by artificial means, otherwise known as healthy springwater. This is because nodody has so far taken note of the fact that so -called 'mountain springwa- ter' can only be create d through the agency of the Earth's planetary motion. Together with certain other co-active f actors, this type of motion conditions the particular climate in which natura lesquely atomised solar energies - chemically termed oxygen - as well as atomised sediments or their released intrinsic attributes (atomic energies in a nascent state) can be bound (emul- s ified). Emulsion means to intermix the oppo sitely-potentiated ethericities of basic elements - so-called emanatio ns - so intimately that, as happens w i t h any other process of genesis, a third something emerges. In other words, a child is born, wh ich is either a male or a female entity, or a her- maphrodite, depending on the type of fertilisation. The hermaphrodite, however, can subsequently be transformed into a predominantly male or female life-form through th e appropriate influences. Mountain springwater comes into bei ng, or the water-child, the physically first-born blood of the Earth, is ur-pro created when geospheric and atmos- pheric rays intimately interbreed under diffuse influences of light and heat with the presence of catalytic second ary radiation. This water decomposes, dies and sinks away agai n if the spring is ov er-illuminated and over- warmed, exposed to direct sunlight - in other words, over-acidified. 15 Such over-acidification can also occur when initially healthy (about +4°C) water is subjected to excessive solar irradia tion on its course, or if it is wrongly (hydraulically) regulate d in improperly profiled and/or conducted in unnaturally alloyed pipes and channels , or is centrifuged in any way by means of iron (steel) motive devices (p ressure turbines, pelton wheels, pres- sure pumps, etc.), i.e. if it is handl ed academically, namely in accordance with conventional scientific doctrine. The blood of the Earth is predominantly maternal, or formative in nature. For this reason it must in-whorl about its ideal axis in exactly the same way as Mother-Earth . Day by day she moves around the ur-fertilising Sun, which constantly alters the angle of incidence of its rays so that no over-fertilisa- tion and therefore no over-acidification can ever occur.

Because of this, hitherto unknown ultra-red rays w i t h a character akin to x-rays and additional heating ef fects of a reactive nature come into being, which make the oxygen present in all water aggressive; its counter- part on the other hand, which is rel eased through the corrasion of sediment, is made passive (inactive). As a result this triggers a reversed interaction between the basic elements; the end-pr oduct of which is the de-animating or life-removing form of atomic energy. This type of emanation radiates in al l directions, overcom ing all resistance and penetrating right through to the negatively charged cell-protoplasm or sediment-nucleus. This it heats up, split s apart, thereby turning the previ- ously healthy life-cell into a new epi centre of decay, whose emission of increased and intensified radioactive (life-destroying) rays (see the discov- ery of Professor Hahn) 16 contaminate all other forms of life and growth. That is to say: they become infected with an atomic embryo of corruption and are turned into the carriers of genetic disease (charged with cancer). An apparently harmless me chanical, physical or psyc hic excess pressure is enough to inaugurate loca lised processes of decom position - the well-known cancerous tumours - that we can observe particularly clearl y in over-illumi- nated and overheated shade-demandi ng timbers. The enlargement of the annual rings, the increasi ngly spongy consistency of the wood, i.e. so-called \"light-induced growth\", has hitherto been taught in all colleges and universities by the academically trained forester as an achievement of forestry science. In doing this he unwittingly enfor ced the destructi on of quality sub- stances in today's monocultivated young forest and made it thoroughly sick with cancer. The next generation had al ready lost its pow er to reproduce and improve in quality, and bore infertile seeds. And thus, like water that has become genetically diseased due to so many retrograde influences - it too is irretr ievably lost. Whatever takes place within the sap system of the plants, also has similar consequences in other nutr itive beds such as blood and groundwater. This is why the present alarming increase in aval anche disasters is also the biologi- cal and therefore the foregone sequel to the structural disintegration brought about by academic errors in motion and influences. The old-growth stands of timber, more firmly rooted in their natural habitat, have fallen vic- tim to irresponsible ove r-felling. Riddled with wh ite and red rot, these wooden cancer-impregnated (spongiform) structures can no longer with- stand the pressures of wind and snow, nor counter the shearing force of the 16 This refers to the German physicist Otto Hahn his fellow German physicist Fritz Strassman who, in collaboration with the Austrian nuclear demonstrated the nuclear fission of uranium physicist Lise Meitner, discovered the radioac- when bombarded with neutrons. - Ed. tive element protactinium in 1917 and who with"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"snow, because the over-illuminated and over-heated ground, devoid of trees and other vegetation, has also become cancerous right down to the root- zone. Through the resulting change to its state of potential and being unaf- fected by further changes in temperature, the ground lost its bio-magnetic, attractive power in relation to the pos itively over-charged snow, and thus, in accordance with the principle - like repels like, the snow began to slip even on gentle slopes and in this way avalanches happened where they had n ever before in living memory. In both cases we are actu ally concerned with the fo rces of atomic pressure and suction, which also expl ain the original processes of sap and blood circu- lation for the first time. It is necessary to understand these processes precisely and to know how to regulate them correc tly if the natural me tabolic cycles are to the maintained, so that atomic energies of a pr edominantly growth-promot- ing and upwardly evolving, i.e. animatin g, nature are to be brought forth indirectly through naturalesque proc esses of emulsion (ur-procreation). Accordingly we are here concerned with hitherto undetectable and unmeasurable interactions between eman ation-essences, i.e. with the princi- ple of countercurrents, wh ose bipolar mixture of ra ys possesses an intrinsic velocity of such a magnitude that it ha s first to be decelerated naturalesque- ly in order to be able to verify its existence with appropriate measuring instruments, or before it can be recogn ised by means of various light-effects in vacuum tubes as an an imating or a de-animating form of atomic energy. It would take too long at this point to provide more detailed explanations, since in principle academics unknowingly generate the same annihilating energies with back-to-front methods of mass motion that th e nuclear physicist, as a supposed means of maintaining peac e, intentionally ge nerates mechani- cally for the radical extermination of all lif e. The former energies act as 'insidi- ous poison' and are the true cause not only of the general condition of physical retrogression and economic decline in soci ety, but also of the ever more wide- spread incidence of cancer. For this re ason the whole of huma nity is beyond all hope of recovery, unless the academic erro rs in mass motion can be eliminated. In order to reconvert over-acidified fr esh water or seawater into genetical- ly healthy drinking and usable water naturalesquely, this most valuable national asset must be conducted in such a way that it can synthesise recre- ative and refreshing atomic energies once more. These energies can then bind and em ulsify excess oxygen. The product of this relatively simple regenerative pr ocess is not only genetically healthy drinking and utilisable water, which can once more develo p and qualitative- ly improve - multiply and ennoble - itself, but it should also be noted in passing that it is also Nature's cure-a ll, which heals and prevents the regres- sive course of cancer.

Just how people and above all our children can be protected from a ghast- ly future and how the Earth may be tr ansformed once more into a true par- adise has been demonstrated through the granting of pioneer patents and through instructions supported by university expert opinion. 17 These will signal the end of present methods of generating electricity, which of course are also based on mechanical ways of moving water, because naturalesquely operating hydroelec tric turbines have not only almost doubled the output, but also serve as the ideal machines for river regulation. This will be discussed later, however, when the occasion arises (see Patent No. 117749 in Appendix). With the collapse of academic demagoguery, the social mass-privation and with it the retrograde development of the spiritually castrated (robbed of quality substances) human ity will also be at an en d, for without the con- tribution of animating atomic energies, individual mental vigour is quite unthinkable. Fire Under Water Schauberger Report, writ ten by Werner Zimmermann. [From TAU, August, vol 148, pp.9-11.] Founded in 1924 in Zurich, Switzerland, Tau (German for Dew) was a periodical, which described itself as a monthly magazine for \"spiritual perception and personal growth, awareness and action\". Sustained by private subscription, it was compiled and published by Professor Werner Zimm ermann and was probably one of the ear- liest so-called 'new age' publications. It c oncerned itself with all aspects of culture in its highest sense, with articles rang ing from raw food to the teachings of Krishnamurti. Naturally aligned to Viktor Schauberger's insights into the inner workings of Nature, it provided an ideal vehicle for the wider dissemination of his ideas. Schauberger and Zimmermann worked together through some of Viktor's most difficult years (1935- 1936), when Viktor fought long and hard battles against the authorities to save both the Rhine and the Danube from total ruin and rehabili- tate them through proper, naturalesque re gulation. Regardless of the personalities and institutions involved and threats to his own person, Zimme rmann fearlessly reported these events, blow by blow, to his readers. - [Editor] We have by no means solv ed all the enigmas of wa ter.

He laughed his hearty laugh, doubtless sensed my over-riding desire to s ee something of these wo nders, and asked me: \"Sparks under water? Have you never seen them yet? Then I'll show you right away, C ome!\" He took two pebbles from a pigeonho le, poured water into a bucket, took it over to a dark corner, and lo, all at once as he rubbed the stones together in the water, they gave off sp arks just as they would have had they been rubbed together in the air. Cold light!! Now for me that was a fairy-tale expe rience, and all those to whom I have since demonstrated this play of sparks in water have ha d similar reactions. It really stood a lot of things on thei r head, and at last gave me access to many insights which Schauberger had presented to us. Schauberger: \"Once in Yugoslavia I was really made to look a fool. I wanted to show the sparks to several unbelieving people and collected two pebbles from the river, but in no way could I achieve the slightest glimmer of light. It thus became clear to me that in their long way along the riverbed, these stones had lost their inner energy. You should therefore select pebbles from the mountains or the upper reaches of a river. But best of all, break a pebble in two and use both halves.\" I will now try to expres s what these underwater sparks have made more understandable to me. For th is I cannot avail myself of customary scientific terminology because I am not in command of it a nd furthermore, because it must lose much of its present validit y. Words have not been developed for these new concepts and facts. This has made it much more difficult for Schauberger to make his theories understandable, and thus he always referred to the facts of the matter as he saw them whenever he spoke of them. 19 In the case of the underwater spar king pebble-stones however, we have the advantage that we are here concerne d with a fact which can be verified relatively easily by anyone without any previous theoretical experience. It is all the more astonishing that there s till must be professors and engineers concerned with hydraulics and river regulation to whom it has not even 18 Zimmerman is referring to Schauberger's does this fiery glow become even more intense when writings in Tau 137, pll, Tau 144, p29, Tau 146, the water approaches its characteristic, anomalous p29, etc. In Tau 137, pages 10-11, Schauberger temperature of+4°C?\" - see footnote 3 on tribolu- wrote: \"If two completely identical pebbles, or two minescence. - Ed. identical, flawlessly grown, fine timbers are rubbed together under water, they give off a dearly 19 As for example in Tau 146 where he wrote on detectable fiery glow - a gleam of light.

It is in the na ture of revolut ionaries and laymen to be creative - such is not the case with the typical run-of-the-mill expert and scientist. To see with ne w eyes and create ne w things, one must boldly step beyond tried and trusted pathways into the unknown. Schauberger has asserted much that seems fantastic from my personal insights and practical experience. At fi rst just about all I could rely on was my finer inner feelings. When I was conv inced of the reliabili ty of his state- ments, I gave him my w illing support. Every subse quent practical verifica- tion, however, has shown th at in the main Schauberge r stands firmly rooted in true reality. Schauberger sees two polar forces at work in everything, which we can denote as male and female, insemina tion and giving birth, spiritual and material, active and passive, positive and negative, Yang and Yin, Heaven and Earth. (Roundness and point, egg and orifice are resp ectively the polar forms of creation.) Further poles ar e: Sun and Earth, Sun and Moon, gold and silver, copper and tin. Both are of equal value, and in thei r interplay these forces create new combinations and forms. Water too is such a creation, whose pr incipal basic elemen ts we know as hydrogen H and oxygen O. Oxygen is active in all com bustion, in all disin- tegration and new construction, as a ma le force, whereas hydrogen belongs to the opposite aspect (female), whic h Schauberger now and then incorpo- rates in the concept of carbone or mother-substance. Fire is the result of a union between a father-substance, O, and a mother- substance, C, H, etc. In a certain sense even water as hydroxide, H 2 O can be construed as a product of combustion ( not that we can thereby comprehend it in its living totality). So just what do sparks under water imply? 1. Through rubbing stones, heat arises not only in the air but also in water; 2. Thus in a stone, fo rces or substances are re leased which are to be described as female; 3. In water there must be fre e oxygen (male), similar to the air, otherwise no flame could be created in the water; 4. If an oxide can actually be created in wa ter by a ray of flame, similar to a marriage between stone (mother-subs tance) and oxygen (father-sub- stance), then we could also conceive that in such a manner, perhaps in a less forceful process, the oxide - water - can also be created. I have no illusions that with this simple observation I have actually proven anything. It suddenly dawned on me what sort of process it might be that Schauberger observed and described as the growth of water (Tau 147, p22 -"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"\"Excommunication and Little Wander ing Springs\", which permitted h i m to consider sediment as the broad, the provisions, for the water's journey and why he also warned so insistently against dredging.

With hands empty and ready to receive, we must climb up i n t o the mountains towards the dawn. Only then shall we begin to under- stand the effects set in moti on by double-spiral pi pes. Yet such organic machines, which are now be ing experimentally built , will still appear as wonders to us. Every marvel, how ever, is none other than the result of con- formities with a law which we still do not understand, and are thus not able to set in motion. Notes on the Secret of Water [From Implosion Magazine No. 46.] Today it is known that water is not just 'water'. There is also heavy water, for example, which has ve ry specific properties. Also water is known in its vari- ous states of aggregation as liquid, vapour and ice, as an inorganic sub- stance (so it is believed), which moves from cloud to ocean and back again. Armed with this knowledge it is usually considered that the most essential aspects of water have been exhaustively explained. In relation to the study of water movement: It was by studying water movement ove r the years that I discovered the enormous difference between the higher and lower grade means of accelera- tion of mass; Wise Nature uses what I call the original motion - the pressure-free, heat- less and thus resistance-free form of motion - by up to 90%; X-rays belong to the developmentall y-dangerous forms of atomic energy. In the resistance represen ted by the fabric of the body they trigger off warm light-effects which, with reac tive force, enlarge cell tissue (loosen the struc- ture). For this re ason alone X-rays are charac ter- or quality -decomposing; That even the smallest effects of pre ssure on water trigger the release of dangerous or harmful X-ray-like radi ation is proven by the following exper- iment: As many as 2,000-4,000 volts are produced an d directly measurable on an electrometer if a drop of water is mere ly allowed to fall a few centimetres due to its own self-weight, and due to the pressure exerted on it by passing through a needle-jet. If the jet pressure is raised to between 2 and 3 atmos- pheres, then the measurin g device already indicates up to 15,000 volts. "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"If this downward fl ow is collected on a metal strip, then 2,200 volts per droplet can be accumu lated. This charge is then conducted by an insulated wire to a vacuum tube, which lights up with a strongly pulsating, dark red glow. If the charge is allo wed to accumulate in a Leyden jar and is conduct- ed from this into petrol (gasoline), it ignites this with a jet of flame, whose magnitude increases as the charge in the jar rises. This demonstrates that this fo rm of energy is predominantly electrical, therefore water-decomposing (or blood- or sap-decomposing). It involves the discharge of analysing energies in ray form. Whether the water is pressed against a wall, or a wall (such as a ploughshare) is pressed against the water (soil moisture), is immaterial , for in both cases this developmen- tally-harmful, decomposive current appears if the needle-jets or the pres- surising surfaces are made of iron. In the case of a ploughshare it is dangerous because it decomposes the blood of the Earth - water. However, if a jet or pressure-imparti ng surface (ploughshar e) made out of copper is used, which is so shaped that a drop in pressure o ccurs with accel- eration - then an apparently identical current capacity is produced quantita- tively, but on closer examin ation this is predominantly magnetic. It draws together the surrounding material through wh ich it passes and therefore has a structure-condensing or quantity-reducing function.

Water and air are tripartite systems, which are mutually related under conditions of contra -directional potential. 20 For this reason certain dif- ferences should be taken into account when decomposing these two sub- stances. In addition, it is necessary to have a general idea of the origin of these groups of substances, what th ey are and what purpose they serve. Viewed biologically, water is an accumu lator as well as a transformer; that is, under certain preconditions certain substances can be introduced into or extracted from water. Water is thus an organ, which is remotely controlled by the cathode and anode systems of the Sun and Moon. Accordingly it can 20 This refers to the different, but reciprocally rela ted directions in which the respective energies of water and air are propagated. - Ed. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"carry out anodic or cathodic functions depending on the given circum- stances. 21 In all processes of solution and combination, water is governed by vari- our influences. The most important, which lead to transformative processes within water itself are a) light and heat, and b) dar kness and cold. The meta- bolic processes in water, therefore, ar e engendered by th e alternation of night and day or the life-rhythm of the Earth. Conversely, metabolic processes trigger dynamic phenomena and thus we are presented with a practical 'perpetuum mobile', which is easily copied , once one comes to understand this ceaseless proces s of Nature's just a little. The first stage in reconstitu ting water is to free it of all solids. Inasmuch as it is practicable, most of the bipolar gaseous el ements should also be removed. Purging the water of matter is most easily achieved by depotenti- ating it, namely the removal of the subs tances that cohere within the water- body itself. Up to now little attention has been pa id to these organic, magnetic forces. Few people suspect that water is an accu mulator of high- potency, vital energies or electrozoic 22 essences. These dynagens, which are absorbed by our bodies when we drink wa ter, for example, are organic plus and minus impulses, i.e. vital life -renewers. For this reas on it matters a great deal what kind of water we drink or use for cooking. Every laundry knows that aqua destillata (distilled water) and rainwater, for example, have markedly different properties in their ability to attract dirt. Whether drinking water deposits energies in our bodies or extracts reju- venating substances is mere ly a question of the temp erament or the will that the water possesses at the time of dri nking. For example, if the water-struc- ture's cohering energies are removed from the carrier substance, then all the solids fall to the bottom a nd most of the gaseous elements escape upwards. Depending on whether it is more strongl y or more weakly discharged, the residual material is a more or less polarised substance, or manifests itself as a deficiency, which has the will to rechar ge itself with subs tances taken from anywhere. This is wh y this polar substanc e acts like a magnet. If we can imagine this depotentiation process in its extreme form, then what is left as residual matter is an ur-substance of such deep valency 23 that the most gigantic metabolic processes can be unleashed, because quite cata- 2l An anode is an electrode carrying a positive Elsewhere, in Healing Water for Human, Beast charge to which negatively charged an ions-, also and Soil - p.xx, Schauberger refers to cathode- electrons, are attracted.

This can of course be put to practical use, providing an appropriate machine has been built in which the contrasting elements can interact in a useful way. Apart from the practical advantages, this also brings other benefits. For example, natural catastrophes could be nipped in the bud, if, at an early stage in their evolution, their innate energies were used to power machines. The Difference between Energising Substances and Fuels [From Mensch und Technik, Spec.ed, relating to Rivers, (Vol.2,1993, sec.8) Author's notes from 7 July 1939] See introductory comments to Concerning Processes of Ur-Cre ation, Evolution & Metabolism, p.xx. If the quickening substances, which in Nature are intended for growth and increase, are misguidedly exploited for powering machines, then it is no wonder that coffins are b ecoming more common than cradles. The best evi- dence of this malpractice are the present methods of streamlining river drainage by straightening the channel, by bank rectification or the construc- tion of dams in a manner that drags in by heels precisely those catastrophes that river engineers are trying to avoid. The form of the channel, its profile and the curves in which the water flows is the negative or mirror-image impression of the fo rces active in the water. Any flow of water, which wei ghs too heavily into the bends, forms meanders or actually eats into the riverban k or destroys it, is sick. If its nat- ural flow is brutally constrained by th e riverbank, then what was originally \"good-natured\" water will become increasingly diseased, malicious and dangerous until it dies and seems to disa ppear. It then returns with punitive vengeance to confound those who robbed it of its health, and who denied its very existence. Where does this strange power in th e water come from? Who are the gods who can confer benefits just as easily as ruthlessly punish? In order to understand these contra-directional forces, we must learn to observe with precision and to understa nd the kaleidoscope of interactive colours and effects, and indeed the ur-l anguage of water. It is a living world of whose might and power the expert s have no conception. The confine- ment of god-like entities or life-energies with ramm ed piles, concrete walls, etc. could only be undertaken by those who have no idea of a life-force that can move mountains and transform waste matter into wholesome food. "},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Quantitative and Qualitative Detonation of Water [From Our Senseless Toil] At a time when the treatment of water by chemical means was being generally hailed as a great breakthrough in public h ealth and safety, Viktor Schauberger's voice was one of the few cautionary voice s being raised against its potentially harmful consequences. - [Editor] The Deterioration of Water For about a decade the groundwater has been sinking so fast in many areas that the number of years before people will be forced to abandon their upland villages and homes can be counted on one's fingers. This is either because their vital water supplies will have ceased to exist or will be obtain- able, if at all, only at great cost. With the sinking of the groundwater ta ble, springs peter out, streams dry up and the soil, which ought to provide our daily bread, dies of thirst. In other places where water rises out of the Earth again, rivers break their banks and turn the countryside into swam ps. In addition to this alarming quantitative shift in the distribution of water in, on and a bove the Earth, an even greater danger threatens: the qualitative deterioration of increasingly- scarce residual sources of water. This will render not just drinking water, but even domestic water, dire ctly harmful to health. Just how far the latter danger has already advanced is clearly evident in a Press article concerning an investigation of the wate r in London's reservoirs and swimming pools. It appeared in the Daily Mail on 23rd August 1933. These investigations established clear proof of the presen ce of over a million bacteria per cm 3 in the water of public swimmi ng baths - places where thou- sands of people seek recreation, yet wh o thereby expose th emselves to seri- ous contagious di seases. If this danger already exists in constantly-monitored facilities, how much great it might be where such co ntrols are ab sent. Apart from these revelations this investigation produced yet another surprise: it was established that where attempts ha d been made to remove this danger through chlorination, bathers experien ced serious inflammation of the eyes and mucous membranes of the nose. "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The Sterilisation of Water One of the most difficult ta sks in the treatment and preparation of drinking water involves the sterilisation of surface water and immature (juvenile) groundwater which endanger health a nd are unsuitable for drinking pur- poses. As a rule this water is taken from rivers, lakes and reservoirs or, where these sources are unavailable, is pumped up from deep wells and rendered (theoretically) drinkable with the use of chemical additives. All those forced to live in cities are we ll acquainted with the bad taste of mechanically-filtered water, water which is contaminated by micro-organic matter, artificially pollu ted by chlorine, irradiation or other sterilising agents and disinfected by chemical co mpounds and other ingredients. What are not known, however, are the co nsequences ensuing from this. While the dreadful repercussions accruing from the continual consump- tion of sterilised drinking water may not be clear to water-supply engineers, doctors cannot claim to be unaware of the causes of the sickness appearing everywhere. Their responsibility is all the greater since they are the ones who are supposed to keep the organic formation of the body and its various stages of development under constant observation and study. In view of the fact that contemporary doctors must al so acquire certain preliminary techni- cal knowledge and an understanding of various basic chemical and physical principles before beginning their medi cal studies (which to a large extent will actually rob them of their connec tion with reality), practising physi- cians should at least understand what effect the continuous consumption of sterilised water will have on th e human body and whet her the continued use of this method of sterilis ation should still be permitted. Those doctors who dedicate their whol e lives to cancer research and are adequately supported financially in their endeavours should first of all ask themselves the question: how does such bacterial life evolve in the human body or in any other organical ly-constituted body? It is not sufficient merely to record the existing facts and to try to eliminate the unwelcome life-forms that already exist. The very fact th at the development of bacteria is enhanced in water - water left standi ng for long periods, flowing slowly in the sunlight or in badly-enclosed, open wells - must point to certain correla- tions which urgently need to be researched, in order to put an end to the danger of disease associated with them. If this path has not yet been trod- den, it is because our practising physicians themselves have already lost touch with Nature. In the final analysis, all attempts to purify drinking water are directed towards creating conditions un favourable to the bacteria l life that evolves in it under certain conditions, in the hope of eradicating it. If the water has been rendered 'hygienicall y impeccable' in such manne r, then, as a rule, one "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"is entirely satisfied with it and be lieves that enough has been done. Quite apart from any other associated hazar ds - for example, residual micro- organic matter unpurged by present systems of sterilisation - it never enters any one's head that certain material energi es will also be denied to people who regularly consume sterilised water, sterilised milk or other sterilised foods. This deficiency w ill lead to a decrease in their mental , physical and se xual potency and will inevitably incr ease the health risks to their weak- ene d bodies. After a lengthy time of constantly consuming water treated in this way, the blood will be systematically destroye d. This enfeeblement leaves the door wide open to the entry of disease. The Consequences of Ch lorination of Water In the increasingly difficult matter of supplying drin king and domestic water to cities and hous ing estates, scant consid eration is given to the water's content of suspende d solids. In addition, its internal physical process- es and character are also completely neglected. As a rule, chlorination is deemed satisfactory to obtain clear, pure and germ-free water. There is hardly a city where water is not disinfected or sterilised through the addition of chlorine , compounds of silv er or irradiatio n with quartz lamps. In all these processes oxygen in statu nascendi, or an allotropic form of common oxygen, is produced which will kill off all living organisms. If water thus treated is dr unk continually then the ve ry same processes that we wish to achieve through water ster ilisation must also take place in our bodies. Frightful consequences can ensu e from the constant consumption of such water. When sterilisation only is taken into account, there arise the var- ious forms of the diseas e we collectively call cancer. In 1920, 2,400 people died of cancer in Vienna; in 1926, 3,700 fatal cases of cancer were recorded; in 1931, 4,900 fell victim to this terrible illness. Fr om these figures the pro- gressive spread of this disease is clearly evident. This dreadful scourge which, despite all the efforts and skills of our medical research institutes, can neither be accu rately recognised for what it is nor effectively controlled, and whose spread a ffects more and more victims, is pri- marily an after-effect of unhealthy or badly-conducted wate r. This not only contributes to the chemi cal make-up of our food and the constitution of our blood, but also determines the quality of the composition of the atmosphere directly surrounding the organisms inside the body. Relevant statistical data clearly reveal that cancer is most pr evalent in those districts where no good, high-quality springwater is available. Even in those places where the spring- water is still good and healthy, it will deteriorate as a result of being trans- "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"ported in pipelines sometimes hundreds of kilome tres long. 24 The emerging pattern of the spread of cancer can be measured against the length of the pipes in which domestic and drinking water flows to it s point of use. This assertion will be immediately countered by the statement that the water has undergone all conceivable tests and its day-to-day content of dissolved and absorbed matter is accurately monitored. If we continue to drink sterilised water only, we must also accept the ensuin g consequences. If we do not wish to suffer a slow death in mind and body, we must search and strive for other ways to cast the Devil out of today's drinking water, but not with the Devil himself! The Consequences of Contemporary Water-Purification Processes The quality and quantity of water's oxyge n content is substantially altered under present systems of aerobic wate r purification which take place under the influence of light. This immediately results in di sturbances to the metab- olism. As a further conseq uence, it results in aggr egations of oxygen which the water in the body, already over-saturated with oxygen, cannot assimi- late. As a result of the additional internal pressures thus created the first symptoms of disease manife st themselves as swellin gs and tumours. In the case of trees, these become clearly visible in shade-demanding timbers exposed to direct sunlight, in warm, strongly-oxygenated soils. The presence of excess oxyg en in the enlarged cells leads to production of high levels of acid 25 and subsequently to infl ammation. This inflammation in turn engenders even higher temperatures - fever - causing the oxygen to become increasingly aggressive and eventually to compensate for the lack of any other carbones by combining with th e substances of the tissue itself. This results in th e emergence of inferior and less complex microbes which, under suitable preconditions, begin their vital activity. In the absence of other food they make a re gular feast of the macro- organism - the body. The disease-causing organism is therefore th e indirect product of incorrect meta- bolic interactions. Science describes th is is as cancer. The only means of defen ce presently available to science is the knife or radiation. Were our doctors to und erstand why cancer ous tumours really 24 Only recently another 427 km long water main light on this effect.

It is a remarkable fact that distille d water greedily absorbs gaseous sub- stances from the surrounding atmosphere , so that it soon takes on the smell of the substances surround ing it. Because such sterile water extracts gaseous carbones from its environs, medicine has also made use of it to purge human blood. The consumption of such water can only bring about a short- lived improvement in the general conditio n. In the most favourable cases it merely acts as a stimulant but, in the final analysis, such water can only act destructively on the organism, since it ultimately removes carbones from it. In this case these are not excess waste products, but the most vitally impor- tant formative substances. The beneficial effect of completely st erile water, therefore, can only be of brief duration, since the su rrounding medium - the bod y - is divested of its most highly essential substances. This then serves to create the breeding ground for new micro-organisms. If a ttempts are made to sterilise water by chlorination alone, some of the oxygen w ill still be retained after the disin- fecting activity of the aggressive oxyg en has ceased. When this encounters the requisite particles of carbone it tri ggers the formation of microbial life in no uncertain measure. The carbones in water should be viewed as negative electrons and the oxygenes as positive electrons which, under the influence of temperature and in conformity with natural law, are mu tually opposed in inverse proportion. If we take in good fo od, good air and healthy, mature water, highly com- plex bacteria are formed which consum e the low-grade life-forms that may eventually develop. If on the other hand we ingest inferior raw materials, whether in low-quality food or carbone-d eficient water, no high-quality bac- teria can evolve. The life -forms developing from these less highly-organised raw materials consume the body, originally brought to life and uplifted by high-grade bacteria. The correct compos ition of the blood and its inherent energies, which are determined by these metabolic processes, are of crucial importance. The decision to breed pred ators or beneficial organisms in our bodies therefore lies comp letely in our own hands - or in the hands and brains of specialists in agriculture, forestry and water resources. A certain uniformity prevails throughout Nature. Hence these symptoms appear in a similar fashion everywhere, as is evin ced by other forms of vegetation. The errors that have been made must ther efore take effect universally and must therefore provoke a general decline. The inner material content of water is also crucial to the height of the groundwater table. As revealed by springwater rising vertically to the top of mountains, the inner energies in matu re water become so powerful that"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"they are able to overcome the inherent weight of water-masses, if aquifers are properly formed and not too large in cross-sectional area. Experimental proof of this is easy to produce, as the photographs in Figs. 7a, 7b & 7c show. The sinking of the groun dwater table is above al l a result of metabolic disturbances in the groundwater. Consis tent with this phenomenon is dis- turbance in the circulation of blood in our bodies and the movement of sap in plants. An Experiment In Our Senseless Toil, Viktor briefly describes a 24-hour experiment using very simple everyday laboratory equipment (see Living Energies, p.132). This was designed to show the dynamics of true springs, the diurnal fluctuation in the height of the groundwater table and of sap in trees - Ed. A small and unassuming experiment reveals a great law. Take a vessel, fill with sand, insulate the sides and the base from the effects of external temperature. By placing ice at the bottom of the vessel a temperature of +4°C (39.2°F) can be produ ced artificially - conditions will be created which are to be found inside the Earth. Into the vessel thus prepared, insert a U-shaped glass tube into which is placed a quantity of pure quartz sand, which is almost chemically neutral. This sand should then be infused with saltwater. Both legs of the U-tube should then be filled w ith good water, enriched wi th absorbed and dis- solved carbones matter which has not been exposed to sunlight. On the open ends of the U-tube place two glass caps, onto one of which are braised two capillary t ubes, and onto the other four capill ary tubes. This must be very carefully done to ensure that the openings of the capillary tubes are not blocked in the process of being fused to the U-tube. When this has been done, expose the su rface of the sand bed to the Sun's rays. When the water reach es the anomaly point of +4°C (due to the ice- cooled sand bed at the bottom of the U- tube), and when the surface of the vessel reaches a te mperature of about +20°C (68° F) as a result of the Sun's heat, then the water, known to attain its greatest density and weight at +4°C (39.2°F), begins to lose its equilibrium and rises up one leg of the U-tube if both legs of the U-tube ar e connected to the capillar ies with suit ably tapered unions. If air is now entrained through the inlets on either side of the U-tube, as occurs for example with boreholes or we lls driven into the Earth, the higher- rising water-column on one side sinks, and the water levels itself out in both U-tube legs, in accordance with the Law of Communication. If both side- "},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Fig. 7a (left): T he constant pulsation in the capillary tube. There is no condition of equilibrium in nature. "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"inlets are once more closed to atmospheric influence and the cold of the sur- round ings again begins to take effect, then after a w h i l e the water will once again  begin  to  rise.  Why does the water subside as soon as it comes in contact with the entrained atmosphere? If both openings are once more closed to atmospheric influence and the co ld of the surroundings again begins to take effect, then after a while the water will once again begin to rise. At night the process is reversed. In the capillaries in which the water pre- viously rose a state of rest exists due to the effect of light and heat, whereas in the o ther capillaries the water now rises. The rising product of the alter- nating processes of equalisation exactly represents the different phenomena of night an d day. This simple experiment shows us why the substances that rise in plants during the day are different from those which rise during the night, and why the various type of blood circulate in our veins. Moreover it reveals many things to us about the sec ret of Life and its coming into being, which can only be achieved through contrasting conditions of heat and cold. At the same time, this experiment al so demonstrates the stupidity of the purely mechanical and thoroughly one-sided activities we call work, and how little we are aware of the underl ying conformities with the laws of Nature and their processes. It would be beyond the scope of the matter at hand to explain all the necessary deta ils and preconditions for the success of this experiment. The development of all Life and the associated form ation of structures is not merely a process to do with heat, as is assumed today, but also to do with cold - for Life can only be born out of differences. It is not possible to describe the subtle differences in th e processes of deco mposition and trans- formation that take place during growt h, or which are necessary to trans- form such energy-bodies as coal, meta ls, minerals and elements and their compounds. It would likewise take up too much space to elaborate all the ways in which it is poss ible to accumulate dissoc iated energy-particles and coalesce them into an immaterial body. One thing can be stated however: our learned scientists should quietly give up all ideas of violently splitting the atom in order to obtain free ener- gy from the matter thus released. These attempts are both purposeless and absurd. Nature shows us in every blade of grass how it can be more simply and intelligently achieved.

From his own research, he determined that the alarming increa se in the incidence of cancer in new suburbs in and around Vienna went hand in hand with the expansion of the water reticulation system in which unnatural materials had been used. - [Editor] Water supply If we study the water su pply system of the ancien t Romans, we can observe from archaeological remain s that when their towns were originally founded great trouble was taken to deliver the necessary water to the place of use in wooden pipes and in conduits of natural stone. It was only later, due to the constant increase in the demand for wate r as the towns grew, that they hit upon the unfortunate idea of conducting bathing and drinking water in metal channels. Where the use of wood was discontinue d, the choice of suitable material for the pipes was determined by observa tion of the behaviour of coins of different metals, which were thrown in to the springs for ritualistic purpos- es. The type that best resisted the various influences over the years was selected. According to the nature of the water many metals became thor- oughly encrusted, whereas others were almost entirely dissolved. When water is supplied in long, iron water pipes serious material transformations can occur under certain circumstances which cannot be detected with pre- sent-day instruments, but which are of crucial importance for the character or the psyche of the water. It is known that electrolytic processes - energetic processes - are instru- mental in the formation of rust. These take place on the internal surface of pipe-walls through the action of carbon dioxide, which evolves as a result of changes in temperature and the pres ence of oxygen. The carbon dioxide released through the reciproc al effects of heat dissolv es the iron in the pipes, "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"in the process of forming ferric bicarbonates. If further quantities of oxygen are added as a result of excessive aerati on of the water, then with the simul- taneous onset of elect rolytic processes the ferric bicarbonate will be convert- ed into hydrated iron oxide (rust). This is precipitated from the water as iron ochre, causing a narrowing of the pipe diameter. This is because the volume of wet iron rust is ten times great er than that of the parent material. As a direct consequence of these pr ocesses a certain amount of carbonic acid is removed. This was formerly contained in the water as an essential ingredient in the constitution of its psyche. Hence the psyche of the water deteriorates. The transformation processes that take place at certain temper- atures and which lead to the formatio n of iron ochre as an end-product already have artificially-pretreated iron as a base material. Whatever natural character the ore lying deep inside the Earth may have possessed is removed as a result of smelting and the admixture of various ingredients. If in the process of forming hydrated ir on oxide, solid components accumulate on the inner wall surfaces, then transformation processes take place in con- junction with a negative temperature gradient. These even tually result in retrogressive transformati ons and lead to the formation of a new inferior psyche which, in certain measure, appears to be associated with the iron ochre. The water, therefor e, has not onl y lost its high-grade psyche by being conducted in iron pipes, but in addition has become endowed with a perni- cious and second-rate psyche. An especial danger arises through the frequent application of tar to the inner walls of iron water-supply pipes. Th is is done in order to inhibit the formation of rust. It is a well-known fact in medical science that the extremely volatile products of coal-tar distillation give rise to cancerous dis- eases in the body, which is why some water-supply authorities have prohib- it ed the use of tarred pipes. As often happens, wate r conducted in this ma nner is also impelled through turbines and physically smas hed to pieces by the high rotational velocity of the blades. When it is discharged from the turbines and subse- quently mixed with other water, serious damage is inevitably inflicted on the organisms and the su rrounding soil to which such water is supplied. This treatment of the Earth's bloo d one can roughly equate with blood transfusions where any kind of blood is drawn off, stirred up with a whisk, blended indiscriminately with foreign bl ood and then inject ed into the body. A person treated in such fashion can become seriously ill and ultimately insane. The same thing must also ha ppen when water treated in the above fashion is drunk over an extended period of time. The blood will be system- atically destroyed. The physical and mo ral degeneration of those forced to drink such water constantly should i ndeed provide ample proof of the accu- racy of what has been stated above. Ev en the spread of venereal diseases is "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"above all to be attributed to far-advanced, enfeeble d conditions of the blood. If the a busive debasement of the psyche of water is to be avoided, then it is essential that the material selected for the supply pipe is not only a poor conductor of heat, but is also of a properly-formed organic nature. The cap- illary is the best model of an ideal water-conduit for the proper conduction and treatment of water in terms of its material composition, internal config- uration and associated functions. The most suitable material is good, healthy wood. Artificial stone (such as concrete) on the other hand is almost as unsuitable as metal for the manufact ure of conduits, beca use only materi- als of natural origin should be used for the conduction of the Earth's blood. To those who protest that wood is unsuitable for the reticulation system of a city because of its limited durability, it should be point ed out that good, properly-treated wood can actual ly last far lo nger than iron. Circumstances permitting, and apart from any other special treatment, these pipes should be laid and su rrounded by sandy, humus-free bedding mater i a l in order to avoi d external destructive in fluences to which pipes laid in the ground are frequently s ubjected. The poor thermal conductivity of wooden pipe-walls inhibits influe nces detrimental to the water's inner metabolic processes. Th is considerably weakens dissociations that take place under a negative temp erature gradient and at the same time retains the quality of the flowing water. 26 The hydraulic efficiency of pipes cons tructed with wooden staves is actu- a l l y somewhat greater than that of ir on or concrete pipes. The frequently- cited fact that wooden pipelines are ch eaper to install should also not be underestimated.

Once a suitable timber has been selected pipes can then be manufactur ed which largely correspond to the necessary requirements. Water can only conserve its pipe system, however, if its inner conformities with law are taken into account. These inner conformities prevail if the substances the water secretes, whic h serve to maintain and build it up, are able to fulfil their respective purp oses. It need hardly be emphasised that the quality of the remaining sources of food will inev itably decline with the general deterioration of the water. The capillaries in animal or vegeta ble bodies serve for the transport of blood or sap, and for the simultaneous and conti nuous build-up and main- tenance of the capillarie s themselves. Hence drin king water supply pipes must be instructed accordingly, othe rwise unwelcome processes will occur which lead to the destruction of the capillaries in the pipe-walls and to unwholesome metabolic processes in th e water itself. These subsequently have the most detrimental effect im aginable on the human organism and on other bodies. We find something akin to this in all waterways. Experience teaches that rivers seldom attack their banks if thei r inner conformity w ith natural law has not been disturbed. On the other hand th ere are no artificial bank-rectification measures that have proved effective long-term, which can withstand the destructive force of wate r whose natural fl ow has been impeded. The reasons for his lie in erroneous methods in use toda y which do not influence the water i tself (which is what really matters), but which try to control it by its banks. Similarly it is of suprem e importance that the composition of the walls of drinking water pipes is suit ed to the natural, inner functions of the conducted substance, otherwise in th e first instance the supply pipes will be destroyed and in the second, it would lead to the destruction of the system of blood-ves- sels in the body. As a result dangerous metabo lic disturbances would occur, which are largely responsible for the increase in cancerous diseases. If the place where a spring is tapped is far removed from the point of use, it is only possible to main tain the character of the water (and then only par- tially) by taking very specific precautions. In no way can this be achieved with present systems of water reticul ation, which are dictated purely by shallow and superficial reasons of profitability and expediency. The only case where slightly more care has been taken in the selection of the pipe material is in the transport of minera l water, wherein the emanations almost leap to the eye. Furthermore in order to satisfy the demand for water, springwater is often supplemented with immature groundwater which still lacks the requisite content of high-grade carbones.

The untoward effect of this development is revealed, inter alia, in the char- acteristic corrosion of turbine blades . The oxygen content enables embryon- ic bacteria, represented by organic ma tter in the water, to develop into bacteria proper. Processes identical to those taking place in the water itself must also occur, if such carbon-deficient and oxygen-rich water succeeds in entering the body. Under suitable temp eratures it will likewise inaugurate transformation processes in the body's prescribed substances. These are not body-building processes, but manifestations of decay. Under these circum- stances the consumption of such wate r will become one of the major causes of the scourge of the twentieth century - cancer. The Consequences of Producing Drinking Water by Purely Mechanical Means The production of drinking water by mechan ical methods alone also leads to unpleasant surprises in many areas lying close to the sea. The conditions for equilibrium between layers of fr esh groundwater and underground sea- water were exhaustively studied by Badon Ghijbens and later by Herzberg. In this case we are concerned with the problem of the hydrostatic equilibri- um between two mixable fluids of different specific weight. In his 1911 paper entitled \"Contribution to the Hy drology of Northern Holland\" 27 , Wintgens writes about this as follows: The specific weight of fluids 1 and 2 are G 1 and G 2 respectively, and the difference in height between the surfaces of the two fl uids after the establishment of a state of equilibrium is H metres; in this case the interface between both fluids will lie at a depth h 1 where: below the overall surface of the fluids. Deriving from this equation, the calculated maximum depth of ground-water h 1 - 42 x H m, on the assumption that the specific weight of freshwater G 2 =1 and saltwater G 1 = 2.024. In Norderny's example, as quoted by Ke ilhack, the surface of the fresh-water lies between 1 and 1.5 metres above sea-level. By calculation this value of H of 1 . 5 metres would correspond to a ground-water depth of 42 x 1.5 = 63 metres. The actual depth of the ground-water was determined as lying between 50 and 60 metres. 27 'Beitrag zur Hydrologie von Nordholland'. - VS"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"If the freshwater-table is now lowered through the excessive extraction of water with large pumps, which also reduces the value of H, then the boundary-layer between fresh and salt water will be disp laced upwards until it finally reaches the level of the suction-head of the pump, with the result that the salinity or the chlorine content of the drinking water increases until it becomes undrinkable. These physico-mechanical processes ar e also augmented by the metabolic processes taking place between freshwat er and seawater. Every new bore- hole driven into the Earth facilitates the penetration of oxygen into the boundary-layer between these two types of water. The condition of the tem- perature gradient between the surface of the freshwater and the underlying boundary layer will also be altered. Th e combined effect of these two com- ponents is such that the water's inner buoyant energies, which would nor- mally maintain it at a certain level, are likewise reduced. In this connection attention should be drawn to the salination of many mountain lakes, which is ultimately attributable to the activities of hydraulic and hydro-electric engineers. First of all, through the wanton clearing of forest the rivers were r obbed of protection from Sun and heat afforded by the leafy canopy of the tr ees. In addition water-courses were subsequently subjected to regulati on by mechanical means alone. Both events produced higher concentrations of oxygen in the water, which then sought out the coarse and fine car bones in the channe l body, dislodging them from both bed and banks. Once this water reaches deeper and cooler lakes where the now-aggressive oxygen is concentrated and if the water is no longer able to retain the quantities of the now-dispersing carbones in suspension, the precipitation of salts then follows and freshwater is trans- formed into seawater. 28 The reverse process happens at great depths in the sea, where strong concentrations of high-grade, complex carbones can even- tuate. There the water is not only fr esh, but also develops a highly potent negative charge, which under certain ci rcumstances can trigger off violent electrical disturbances in the depths of the ocean. Deep-Sea Water Were our learned scientists to investigate deep-sea water more thoroughly, they would discover that the material composition of the ai r absorbed by it differs substantially both in quality and quantity from that contained in extreme surface water. This fact also explains why deep-s ea fish can glow and impart electric shocks. In its funda mental structure, the air absorbed by 28 This perhaps explains the formation of marinectic lakes in which water is salty in the lower part and fresh in the upper part - Ed. "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"deep-sea water exhibits a similar composition to that still found in a few iso- lated high altitude springs. It is the high content of physically-dissolved car- b onous matter and the lack of oxygen, co upled with the simultaneous exclusion of light, th at gives this water it s peculiar character. Seawater at great depths cannot abso rb gases by diffusion or convection. Therefore where the oxygen has also been consumed by living organisms, s uch seawater can actually be locally co mpletely devoid of oxygen - or even fresh. Because the carbon dioxid e content of the atmosphere is less over the sea than over the land, the conclusion can be drawn that the surface of the sea also absorbs carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. 29 Deep-sea creatures can be distinguished from their counterparts in shal- l o w waters by their size, their strangel y-constructed eyes, the different con- s istency of their bodies and, to a large extent , by their particularly original body-shape. The external environment stamps each individual with its own characteristics. Hence there are certain contradictions which can only be explained by understanding the nature of the water in wh ich these organ- isms live. One would tend to think that, owing to the water-masses pressing upon it, an organism living in the deep sea would have a correspondingly more strongly-built body. However, in contrast to the fish with robust skeletons and strong muscles found along the shor eline, deep-sea fish have extremely delicate, paper-thin, almost weightless sk eletal frames. The fact that these creatures burst open when they are br ought up from the depths is also attributed to the physical structure of their bodies. This purely mechanical explanation is a serious error. Just as the organisms brought up from the deep sea regularly explode, the same occurs with water raised from such depths. It will warm up relatively quickl y with the addition of the requisite quantity of oxygen a nd highly complex carbons (such as oil) or will burst its container if this is sealed. 30 A great many natural phenomena occurr ing in the depths of the ocean could easily be explained were the experts aware of the inner nature and character of deep-sea water. This holds particularly true for the phenome- non of ebb and flood, whose true nature will be described in a later chapter.

If the blood-vessels of a snail are ex amined, two differently-coloured sys- tems of blood-vessels are evident. The blood flowing in th e outer system of vessels is lighter and in the inner system, darker. The composition of the blood in the outer system is distinguished by a greate r oxygen content and is substantially different from that of the inner system, which exhibits a higher content of carbones. Inves tigations further demonstrate that suspended mat- ter is concentrated in the middle of the capillary cross-section, whereas dis- solved matter congregates more towards the peripher y. In addition, if the blood-flow is deemed to be moving along a straight line then the velocity of forward motion is less at th e periphery than at the centr e. In this regard, how- ever, note that this difference in speed is only illusory. The forward motion of the inner particles of fluid only appears to be faster than the outer blood parti- cles. This is because the latter must de scribe a path roughly corresponding to a double-helical motion - a spiral motion wi thin a spiral - wh ereas in the main the inner blood particles appear to perform a simple spiral motion. The second component of the double -spiral movement described by the blood corpuscles of the inner system can not be observed, b ecause the line of the second spiral is an energy path imperceptible to the eye. This has a much higher meanin g, for we are here concerne d with processes of qualita- tive psychic enhancement, the raising of the psyche to a higher energetic and immaterial level. This not only infl uences the character of the blood, but in the course of further development al so affects the character or psyche of the respective organism. In contrast to customary methods of investigation, the conviction is slow- ly gaining ground in various fields of research that the object under exami- nation should be decomposed into its constituent parts to enable the study of its very smallest aspects. The frequently-mentioned 'material transformations in water' are out- wardly identifiable throu gh the pulsation of water.

Water is theref or e invested with a cer- tain inner vitality and a decisive role as it rises up in the capillaries in con- cert with the supply of nece ssary formative substances. On many occasions I have stated that the rising of sap in trees cannot be explained by physical factors alone - such as the effect of external air pres- sure. Its explanation is to be found in ongoing metabolic processes in con- stant pulsation in every cell of the tree. It is therefore a result of the vital activity of the capillary tr ee-cell. Professor Kurt Berg el of Berlin came to similar conclusions in relation to the activity of the heart and the blood in animal life. He rejects the current view that the motor - the heart - is sup- posed to pump blood into all parts of th e body. On the contrary this work is performed by the millions of highly active capillaries permeating the body. This fluid-raising capillary force is only effective up to a certain height. An external aid is therefore necessary. This Bergel demonstrated with a small experiment. He stood the base of a bundle of hair-thin tubes in water and lightly and regularly tapped it at the top, causing water to flow continuous- ly out of the upper ends of the capillaries. 31 In his view health and disease are pr imarily dependent on the faultless or disturbed activity of the capillaries. Professor Bergel furnished definite proof of this in his investigations of a bird 's egg. After being incubated for only a short period of time a small red spot appeared on an egg, which on closer inspection proved to be a drop of blood. If the egg is incubated further, then a network of arteries can already be di stinguished on the skin of the yolk- sack. Rhythmical pulsations can still be detected ju st before it cools off. The Double-Spiral-Flow Pipe Both in cross-section and longitudina l section the double-spiral-flow pipe satisfies all the criteria necessary for a water-supply pipe, if it is to convey healthy water to the place of use. By means of a sy stem of vanes made of precious metal arranged on the inner surfa ce of the pipe walls (see figs. 8, 9, 10 & Patents Nos. 134543 & 138296 in Appendix), the water-masses are con- ducted along a double-spiral -flow pipe in such a wa y that the movement of 31 From Implosion Magazine No 5, p.17: network about 75 times a minute; 10,000 litres \"Contemporary medicine ascribes the major role in pe r day, almost 4,000,000 litres per year.

Bodies lighte r than water are im pelled towards the periphery. Water-masses conducted in this fashion are slightly warmed through the interplay of mechanical forc es of friction on the vane -surfaces, leading to the separation of oxygen in the inner region of the pipe and its subsequent con- centration at the periphery. At the same time as th e oxygen is ejected, all the bacteria migrate towards the periphery as well, since their livi ng conditions in the more central part of the cross-section have now become unsuitable. In company with the bac- teria, all the water-polluting particles are also dispatched towards the periphery of the pipe. Thus the water is easily and simultaneously purged of suspended matter. 32 See also the translations of Austrian Patents Nos. 134543 and 138296 in the Appendix.- Ed."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" Fig. 11: The flow dynamics of the double-spiral pipe Once bacteria have transferred to the peripheral zone in search of the required oxygen, and after a certain peri od of time in water completely cut off from outside influenc es, they are overwhelmed by a localised concentra- tion of oxygen. In this way precisely those pathogenic bacteria susceptible to an excess of oxygen are advantageously eliminated, whereas non-patho- genic bacteria which are not harmful to human health, but in many cases are actually beneficial, are to a certain extent retained. At the same time as the content of absorbed oxygen is sepa rated from the carbones contained in all water, the inner core of the water surges ahead in a simple spiral move- ment (vortical movement along the longitudinal axis), because the surface tension of the water becomes physically reduced as a result of the above- mentioned separation of oxygen from the particles of carbone. "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The physical reduction in surface tension results in a mechanical accelera- tion, leading to the self-purification and energetic charging of the centrally- accelerating water-masses. On the othe r hand this charging of energy gives rise to further processes related to the overall equilibrium between the heavy, centrally-accelerating bodies and the energy-rich water. With the ensuing simultaneous cool ing solid particles are separated and are again directed towards the periphery. There they combine with oxygen and are reunited with the centrally-accelerati ng water in the form of additional energies. Those particles of matter not dr awn into the centre will be pressed onto the surface of the pipe walls by the prevailing mechanical pressure, there to combine with the raw materi als from which the timber was origi- nally formed. Thus they seal the pores of the wood, which in this way becomes more durable than iron. Once again we are here concerned with a nat- ural process whose active principle is operative in the formation of all capil- laries. The capillaries not only constr uct themselves, but also protect mselves against harmful influences. As a result of accelerat ion of the entire body of water peculiar to the dou- ble- spiral-flow pipe, greater quantities of water can be conveyed than in an ordinary smooth-walled pipe and, due to the efficacy of the oxygen, exten- s ive self-purification and se lf-sterilisation of the water occurs which con- stantly increases in quality through the uninterrupted bui ld-up of energy as it moves along its path. The reason for this is as follows: as they accelerate, centrally-conducted water-masses ar e simultaneously cooled, with the result that gases evolving from the carbones become concentrated in the flow-axis, where the lowest temperatures reside. This conc entration decreas- es towards the peripher y. The oxygen on the other hand is concentrated around the periphery of the pipe, reachi ng its most aggressive state at the interface with the warmer pipe-wall, giving rise to mutual interactions between the two basic substances from the periphery inwards. This subse- quently leads to the aforementione d interactions which qualitatively enhance both water and wood. In the course of time the relative sp acial distribution of the more central flow of water and the interactions at th e surface of the pipe walls arrive at a certain state of equilibrium. These processes then cease - the water is now mature and both wood and water have beco me almost immune to harmful outside influences. Whereas oxygen is located in the peripheral zones of the pipe, the free particles of carbonic acid congregate in the boundary zone of the inner core of water as a result of the water temperatures prevailing there. The carbones contained in the water, in bound form, necessarily accumulate in the central axis, which is predominantly saturated with carbones. By arranging the in-built, specially-shaped vanes in a particular way, aggres- sive particles of oxygen on the boundary layer of the outer edge of the inner "},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"core of water, are brought into continuous and direct contact with the most aggressive carbon dioxide , resulting in a continuous generation of energies. These are drawn further towards the centrally-accelerating water-masses, due to the decrease in temperature to wards the central axis of the pipe. Accordingly two types of circulation ar e created in the cr oss-section of the pipe: the mechanical circulation of the water and the counter-circulation of those energies that evolve when aggressive particles of oxygen encounter free carbon dioxide. This ci rculation of energy manifests itself in the form of a continuous electro-dynamic process. In this instan ce it does not take place at the walls of the pipe, but at the boundary zone of the water's inner core, resulting in the qualitative uplifting of its physical , material, energetic and imma- terial attributes - but not in the destruct ion of the pipe walls. These double-spiral-flow pipes also convey matter heavier than water down the middle of the pipe and at the same time ennoble and refine it, so that oils of inferior qu ality, for example, will be improved during flow. After smelting, iron ores transported in th is fashion yield a higher-grade iron, because in the process of being trans ported, the oxygen in the ore is con- sumed in the formation of new carbone compounds (reduction processes), which then contribute towards the materi ally higher composition of the car- bone - iron. The Pulsation of Water Life takes place in three spheres: 1. in the Carbonesphere; 2. in the Atmosphere; 3. in the Stratosphere. These various spheres are inter-connected through the agency of water. On the other hand water's vari ous states of aggregati on form the bridges for the formation and transformation of th e basic elements it transports, which are thereby transferred from the stratosphere into the interior of the Earth and vice versa. Apart from the purely mechanical cycle of physical water, there is another form of circulation which operates in the opposite dir ection - the 'energy cycle' Here two contrasting moveme nts are involved: the upward move- ment of carbones with the carrier wa ter and the downward movement of oxygen. At the point where the paths of these mutually opposed currents intersect, energy is freed. Owing to the constant variation in the length of night and day, these energetic interactions cannot arrive at a state of equilib- rium. So shifts in individual micro-climatic conditions must constantly "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"occur, resulting in continual modification of the qualities and quantities of basic elements. The outcome of this continuo us reciprocal interaction is the metamorpho- sis of the different forms of water in each individual zone and the constant transformation of the various species of vegetation in which water, cease- lessly moved by this interplay of for ces, wends its onward way. This inner equalisation of forces is to a certain extent inhibited by the effect of the self- we ight of the water. Through fl uctuations in the magn itude of the compo- nent forces, water particles are constantly made to rise and fall. In other words the pulsation of the water inevitably occurs. Every new entity and all growth evol ves from the smallest beginnings. Further development in the early stages can only be accomplished if the cycle in the interior of the Earth proceeds correctly. In the natural order of things, every higher form of vegetation is built up from th e lower forms pre- ceding it. The carrier of the necessary elements and the mo derator of life- processes in the vegetation root-z one is groundwater, whose movement is trig gered by a drop in te mperature, which on its part is caused by inner metabolic processes taking place in the here-decisive groups of basic ele- ments. The impulse for the movement of water is hence a product of inter- actions between the opposing elements it contains, the necessary resistance for which is supplied by the water itself . This resistance to the interaction between the carbones and the oxygen further results in continual fluctua- tions in temperature, which impart an additional impulse to the movement - the pulsation of the water. As it moves along its path water dissolves salts at one moment, transports them at another, deposits them at a th ird and creates and tr ansforms energies. The essence and purpose of these eterna l metamorphic proce sses is to build up and maintain various forms of vege tation and physical bodies, which on their part represent bridges by which energies are created and maintained. The potential differences that are always present between the inner tempera- ture and the outer ambient temperature are none other than different patterns of force which both terminate and re activate the circulation of water. The two forms of evolution are therefor e of material (physical) nature and of immaterial (spiritual) nature. All that exists, be it a stone, a plant, an ani- mal, a human being, a planet or the Sun, represents an organism possessing both body and soul. Every ray of light a nd heat requires a physical form in which it can manifest itself and evolve . Every body requires an inner energy which creates and transforms it. When a body decays, then the energies that initially created it are again freed. They are never lost - should they lose their habitat with the decay of the body, then they willingly coalesce with the water that eternally circulates in, on and over the Earth and transmute it into to a new life-form. Therefore wherev er we look there is life, eternal cre- "},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"ation and transformation, Should we look into apparent emptiness, then a sea of spiritual life , of past and future generations stares us in the face. Every material form of vegetation al ways has its immaterial counterpart in light, heat and radiation. Every ch ange in sphere changes the overall internal and external conditions, alters the weight and inner intensity of the radiation of the physical substance - wa ter - and thus the direction in which the carrier of life moves. Disturbances to the inner and outer conformities with natural law lead to the disturbance of the very foundation of all life's creative processes. The disappearance of water or its material transforma- tion is a very serious warning sign, for if its inner structure and composition are changed then its character and hen ce the character of all forms of life, including humanity, wi ll also be changed. Regression in the quality of the vari ous forms of vegeta tion, qualitative deterioration of the highest plant organism - forest - and the increasing physical and moral decaden ce of humanity are simply the logically-consis- tent symptoms of disturbance of the physical constitution of water and dis- ruption of the geosphere brought about by humanity's subversive activity in the organism 'Earth'. The religion of the Chinese forbade any kind of intrusive interference with the Earth. Even the co nstruction of railways in China encountered stiff opposition in religious circles. In the light of all that has been stated so far it can be seen that the culture of the Chinese, which has endured longer than that of any other people, is no accident. It owes its ex istence to the fact that the carbone-sphere remained untouched for a long period of time. China's decline was inevitable the moment the Chinese began to adopt the manners, customs and technological achievements of the western wo rld. Another hor- rendous example concerns developments in Russia, which took only 15 years to catch up with what other na tions had taken 100 years to achieve - famine. What we are experiencing today is no crisis. It is the dying of the Whole - the qualitative, physical deterioration of all organisms initiated by the dis- ruption of Nature's water-balance. In step with this proceeds the moral, intellectual and spiritual collapse of humanity. This collapse is already so far advanced that despite all the warning signs, people are still unaware of the gravity of the situation. Behaving far more cruelly than animals, people see their ultimate salvation in decimating the mass of human ity with weapons which - together with the banners under which our children are supposed to bleed to death - our priests actually bless. The decision - whether we take the latter road of collapse or save our- selves at the eleventh hour from ou r own self-mutilati on - lies only with ourselves or with politicians and men of science who take upon themselves a truly appalling responsibility. They do not consider the seriousness of the sit-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"uation and are unable to provide any really effective assistance in salvation - and out of selfish interest they continue to a dhere firmly to their present point of view. Healing Water for Hu man, Beast and Soil As long as humanity refr ained from interfering w ith Nature's interdepen- dent organic functions, and as long as Mother Eart h could still supply her blood - water - to the vegetable kingdom in a healthy condition, there was no necessity to contemplate how wholes ome water could be produced arti- ficially in the same way that it is naturally constituted inside the Earth. Today, where almost all healthy springs have either dried up, or the water has already been intercepted at its s ource and delivered to urban areas in wrongly-constructed water-mains, the soil and the entire animal kingdom have to rely on worn out, stale and co nsequently diseased water. Even quite immature water (full of in ferior, less complex substa nces, and torn from the womb of the Earth), or health-enda ngering surface water (sterilised with chemical additives) must be supplied for human use. It is therefore high time that we discover ways and means of protecting human, beast and soil from the decay that must le gitimately follow if the Earth dies of thirst - as a result of the internal decomposition of water arising from current economic measures and industrial practices. Nature alone can and should be our Gr eat Teacher. If we wish to regain our spiritual and physical health, we should not simply rely on secondary mechanical or hydraulic phenomena. As a first priority we must see to it that sublime conformities with natu ral law are thoroughly investigated - conformities which govern the ways in which Mother Earth prepares her life-giving fluid and the means she uses to conduct it to the point-of-use. Once we have unveiled this secret, if we faithfully copy what has been tried and tested over millions of years, then we are on the right track. Only then can we intervene analogously in Natu re's vital functions and harvest an over-abundance of the best and most noble fruits that Mother Earth has cre- ated and maintained in c ountless varieties with the aid of healthy blood. In order to penetrate the great mystery surrounding the origin of all life, we must take an interest not only in our living space, but in the 'above and below', in which water pursues its eter nal cycle in obedience to a great and immutable law. It may be impossible for us to observ e the wonderful processes in crystal- clear water with our eyes, and likewi se impossible for us to accompany "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"water on its mysterious path above and below the E arth. Nevertheless an indirect, inductive way still li es open to us to research those thi ngs we can- not see but which we absolutely must know about, it we wish to remain healthy and hence to se rve the purpose of life: continuous creation. Up to now all that humanity has ev er done has been to commit crimes against Mother Earth. In so doing not on ly do we inflict grievous injury on ourselves but also on the natural envi ronment. With endless patience she has passively suffered humanity's interf erence and intrusions, motivated by greed, avarice and ignoran ce. However as a result of continuous ransacking and thorough ventilation of the Earth, inner decomposition of her blood is taking place and with it the dying of the soil that feeds us. 33 Not only have pumps been attached to the inner circ ulation of water, wrenching it prema- turely from the Earth's womb, but al so the water flowing over the Earth's surface has been ruined through sensele ss regulation of water-courses. As if this were not enough, we also cut down Mother Earth's forest or destroy it organically, and now our own head is finally on the chopping block. This had to happen in order to bring humani ty to its senses and to the under- standing that nothing in this world go es unpunished. Ultimately every fool- ish interference with Life's wondrous workings - Nature - must exact its vengeance on humanity itself. The fable of a former paradise is no figment of the imagination. Although our ancestors may indeed have been e ngaged in a constant struggle for sur- vival, their lives were still relatively carefree by comparis on with the pre- sent era. But what will it look like after a further generation, if it continues to go downhill at its present rate? What future will our ch ildren have to face if no way can be found to stem this dreadful, festering tide? Today we are already confronted by events that must shake every thinking person to the very core of their being. What purpo se is served by continuous self-decep- tion or by deluding ourselves in the foolish hope that somehow things will improve by themselves?

"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"again, then we must apply the lever where life begins. The origin of life - the u r-substance - is water, which is the guardian of the secret of all becoming and evolution. This secret will only be unveiled once we have conic to understand the innermost nature of water. In exactly the same way that a ripe apple falls to Earth from the tree, water rises out of the Earth of its own accord when it is mature. It matures when it has so transformed itself internally that it can and must take leave of Mother Earth by overcoming its own physical weight. While correct methods of spring-capt ure cannot be addressed in great detail here, reference sh ould nevertheless be made to the skills of the ancients. These skills were either lost or had to yield to worse practices. Where possible, the Romans tapped thei r springs in such a way that at a certain height above the mouth of the spring they placed a c over in the form of a thick stone slab, carefully levell ed and smoothed, on the sloping face of natural rock. Having been completely sealed all around the perimeter with d riven wedges, a hole was then cut in the stone slab into which the outlet pipe was inserted and secured, so that no entry of air was possible. In spite of and because of their simplicity, a ll methods of spring-capture in those days were more mindful of the nature of water than contemporary systems. Apart from other serious errors, cont emporary systems have also frequently destroyed the conditions of water ci rculation and metabolism between the spring and its surroundings, principally by over-extensive building works and by disturbances in the vicinity of the spring caused by the use of lime, cement and metal pipe-fittings. The following statements should not be taken as a recipe for the produc- tion of healthy water. It should only be st ated here that even in this area a thinking person can make good the sins of his or her ancestors, and is capa- ble of producing good, hea lthy water in the same wa y that the Earth does. It is quite obvious to us that a mighty tree can ultimately develop from a healthy seed planted in the earth. It is thus equally understandable that only ripe and healthy water can produce hea lthy fruits. In the same manner that a seed in the moist earth requires heat and cold, light and shade, and the energies associated with them, exactly the same appl ies to water. Water has an equal need of these opposites in orde r to build itself up and reconstitute itself internally. The very reason wate r wends its long way through the uni- verse is to maintain and gather these o pposites. In every dr op of water dwells a world of possibilities. Ev en the Divine has Its abod e in every drop of water. If we destroy water, if we remove it from its cradle of the forest, then we stu- pidly rob ourselves of our mo st prized possession - our health. With it we lose our place of birth - our habitat - as well. As restless as wa ter which has been wrested of its soul, we too must once more take to the road. Wherever we alight, decomposition, un rest, ruin, poverty and privation soon begins. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"However, if our work is to become a blessing instead of a curse, then we must content ourselves with living off the interest and the superabundant, ripened products of the Earth's capital. We must never live off the substance of the Earth directly. Water supplies this interest in such a valuable form that we could do without all the rest and live off her surplus alone, taking only what is ripe, once we understand ho w the Earth manages her household. We still have time and we still have water. If at long last we finally take proper care of this giver of life, then all will right itself again automatically!! Good high-grade springwater differs from atmospheric water (rainwater) in its inner material cont ents. Apart from dissolved salts, high-grade spring- water possesses a relatively high quota of gases in free and bound form (such as carbon dioxide and carbonic acid). Up to 96% of the gases absorbed by good high springwater consist of co mpounds of carbone. Under the term carbone is here to be und erstood all the carbons of the chemist, all elements and their compounds, all metals and minerals - in a word, all substances except oxygen and hydrogen. Atmospheric water (rainwater, aqua destillata, condensate) or surface water exposed to strong aeration and in tense light influences exhibit a com- paratively high oxygen conten t, almost no salt (or on ly less-complex forms), little or no free carbon dioxide and bound carbonic acid, and an absorbed atmospheric gas content predominantly of oxygen in physically dissolved form. The expression \"physically dissol ved form\" here means a more highly- evolved solution (compound), comprising groups of substances not occur- ring in purely chemical forms of solution, and in which energetic processes are already actively involved. Following from this, we therefore di fferentiate between water possessing a high percentage of carbone energies and water exhibiting a high percentage of oxygen energies. The former we will describe as cathode-water- and the lat- ter as anode-water+. Cathode-water possesses a negative form of energy and anode-water a positive form. These energy-forms are characteristic of what we describe as the sphere, psyche or character of water. Accordingly, high- grade springwater bubbling out of th e Earth possesses a preponderance of carbone-spherics - negative energy-forms or ne gative character - whereas rainwater coming from the at mosphere chiefly exhibits oxygen-spherics - pos- itive energy-forms or positive character. Apart from the necessary isolation from light and air and a capacity to absorb certain transformative substances (metabolic catalysts), atmospheric water infiltrating into the ground also requires certain lengths of path and periods of time in order to carry out the restructuring process correctly - to become inwardly ripe. Only mature and therefore healthy water can pro- duce good fruits. In the same way that the seed requires heat, cold, light and shade and the energies associated with them for its deve lopment, so too"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"does water in order to be able to build itself up and transform itself internal- ly. 34 Water is ripe when its absorbed air contains a1 least 96% carbon-spher- ics, together with a quota of solid carbones associated with such a sphere. It is p recisely upon this inner ripeness that water's excellence and up-rising or levitative force de pends. The longer the path travelled, the more highly- organised and qualitatively higher-grade its inner energy becomes, provid- ed that the appropriate transformative substa nces are present. The closer to the centre of the Earth, the more complex and aggre ssive the oxygen-groups infiltrating with the water become. When atmospheric water infiltrates into the ground its oxygen content becomes concentrated as it approaches the geothermal lo w-point of +4°C (+39.2°F). All the carbones present above this boundary layer, which com- bine with the particles of oxygen as they approach it, are thereby restruc- tured. Some of these rise upwards as nitrogen while others remain behind as salt crystals. Such oxygen-charged water can therefor e take with it no ne of the car- bones previously brought up from the Earth's interior through the reverse process, below the boundary layer of +4 °C. It must leave them behind in the vegetation zone. This vegetation layer is akin to a sub-depot which is con- tinuously supplied with oxygen or carbone s from above or below through these reformative processes. It is limited in depth by the geothermal neutral layer of +4°C. The water that sinks further beyond this boundary layer can only take with it those surplus or less-complex portions of oxygen which cannot interact or enter in to a restructuring process (oxidation), for lack of the presence of suitably-organised carbones in the vegetation zone. Due to rising temperatures with increasing depth in the interior of the Earth, which themselves are actually engendered by these interactive processes, the oxygen descending with the water becomes increasingly aggressive. This enables both the inte raction and recombination of various grades of oxygen with carbones. These carbones have also become progres- sively less complex with increasing de pth. Ultimately even coals (carbones in a solid state of aggregation) are decomposed and restructured when aggressive oxygen comes into direct contact with them under high pressure (which arises simultaneously because of this). Incidentally, we also find something similar in the transformati on of foodstuffs in our bodies: this transformation takes place with the intake of water and air, and activates metabolic processes that condition life. The higher these reconstituted and ennobled carbones rise towards the Earth's surface, the lower the surrounding temperatures become with the approach towards the boundary layer of +4°C. During this process oxygen 34 Last two sentences from Spec. Ed. Mensch und Technik, Vol. 2,1993. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"components of groundwater also become less aggressive. The higher-grade the carbon e s , the less complex the oxygen groups need to be in order to com- plete the interaction, and vice versa. The relative position of the boundary layer of +4°C also varies, due to fluctuat ions in ground temp eratures caused by the rising and setting of the Sun and the alternation of the seasons. Generally speaking, this layer lies higher by day and deeper by night. When assessing the causes of fluctuations in the groundwater table, the introduc- tion of the already well-know n concept of the saturation deficit is necessary, with which the relation between temperature and water-vapour content of the atmosphere is determined. The climatic conditions of Central Eu rope are of moderate continental character and are distinguished by maximum rainfall in the summer months. However, this is associated with a correspo nding increase in evapo- ration due to higher temperature - thus the saturation deficit will be greater. The annual rainfall distribution in Central Europe amounts to 9%-13% in the summer months and 4% -6% in the winter months. According to Mayer's findings (Meteorologische Zeitung, 1887), these values for rainfall distribution are to be compared with summer and winter saturation deficits of 3mm- 7mm and 0.3mm-1.0mm respectively. With equal levels of relative humidity, and with rises in temperature from -10°C to +30°C, the water content of th e atmosphere can ri se more than fif- teen-fold. Only when data concerning the amounts of rainfall and the satu- ration deficit have been studied will it be possible to arrive at laws governing the fluctuations in the height of the groundwater table. Generally speaking, however, since at present these two meteorological components can neither be added together directly, nor cancel each other out, fluctua- tions in the groundwater table must therefore be dependent primarily on their reciprocal interaction. The possi bilities for practically applying the here-decisive conformities with natu ral law encompass the effortless and almost costless raising of the deep-lying groundwater table in deserts. Apart from the mechanical interplay of forces co- active in the raising and sinking of the groundwater table, another factor to be taken into account is the physical interaction - the absorption of portions of carb one elements and the binding of gaseous carbones, whic h are diffused (dispersed) through the water at a suitable temperature if isolat ed from light and external air. The highest dispersion of carbone groups is always present in the immediate proximity of a concentration of oxygen that occurs under these circum- stances - which means that the wate r can complete its reconstitution and become intern ally mature. The water lying above the boundary la yer now further charges itself with carbones present in the vegetation zone of the Earth, using up more and more of its oxygen in the process. When a certain degree of saturation is"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"reached following an increase in ground temperatures towards the ground surface in summer, it then has to release carbonic acid, which rises in the form of bubbles and mechanically assists in raising the wate r in the soil's capillaries. This interplay of forces is boosted by yet another physical ener- gy-form - the oxygen-starvation of wa ter over-saturated with carbones, which creates a negative pressure (vacu um), resulting in th e raising of the water. Good, high mountain springs do not gush out of th e ground due to excess mechanical pressure (as has hitherto been assumed), but because of the effects of negative pressure (suction). In the final an alysis these are due to processes of material transformation - combination of mech anical and phys- ical effects related to th e non-compressibility of wate r at +4°C. This explains the phenomenon of high-altitude springs that rise on mountain peaks or at great heights, which are caused to rise to the surface through the action of physical opposites. When carbones, whose quality constantly improves the higher they rise, draw closer to the concentration of oxygen present in the upper regions of the atmosphere, the last remnants of the accompanying water crystallise under the low temperatures prevailing at this altit ude. They descend with the oxygen again as microscopic partic les of ice. Now m oving without a car- rier and continuing to rise, the rema inder of the extremely diffused carbone particles ultimately reach the highest oxygen concentr ation of all - the Sun - and contribute to the organic, formative processes of the solar system. The reverse process takes place in the dept hs of the Earth, where carbone groups - coals - already compacted and con centrated, are decomposed under the influence of the most highly-aggressive oxygen. The energies in the upper regions of the atmosphere, which evolve from the interaction between highly-complex carbone groups and less-complex quantities of oxygen, return to Earth ag ain by way of radiation. Conversely, radiant energies that have been released in the depths of the Earth are drawn upwards. Gaseous hydrogen, whic h becomes denser as it approach- es the Earth's surface, offers a resistance to the interactions through which these energies are transformed into light or thermal radiation. In this form they finally reach the Earth and cont ribute towards the organic build-up of various forms of vegetation. The nature of the processes taking place deep inside the Earth is such that their eff ects are projected in the opposite direc- tion. Radiation, light and heat are ther efore the counterparts of certain forms of energy evolving at the Earth's surface. Vegetation (material bodies) is equally the result of the restructuring processes continuously taki ng place. Water is ev erywhere involved, and with its assistance the necessary interac tions occur. Every change in form of vegetation hence inevitably leads to the modification of this inner transfor-"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"mation and development to an alteration of climatic co nditions and thus to a change in the inner character of the world's blood, water. The proper- ties or character of the Earth's blood is conditioned by the sum total of cir- cumstances that have only just begun to be considered by our experts. The beneficial or detrimental influences of certain substances co ntained in water, such as chlorine, ammonia, manganese, iron, sulphuric acid and so on, will not be discussed here, sin ce these are dealt with quite sufficiently in the rele- vant technica l literature. From our poi nt of view, we are primarily interested in the oxygen content and the carbon di oxide content in its various bound forms, including its salts. In various publications it is gradually becoming evident that increasing attention is being paid to compounds contained in water, which manifest themselves in a certain labile state. Major changes in temperature and the influence of light and air can destro y these delicate form ations within a short space of time. Thes e formations, however, ar e what really matters. With regard to ordinary drinking water, this is particularly applicable to semi-bound carbonic acid and how it is incorporated in bicarbonates of salts. However, 'uncombined' carbonic acid is also of great importance, since it is the essential contributing factor to the refreshing taste of good, high-grade springwater, and, as 'associated' uncom bined carbonic acid, it necessarily contributes towards mainta ining the labile bicarbonates of salts in solution. Above a certain concentration the co ntent of uncombined car- bonic acid endows the water with aggr essive properties and has a detrimen- al effect on metal surfac es, particularly with th e presence of oxygen. The importance attached to the supply or excl usion of air is due to the fact that in groundwater, for example, pyrite doe s not decompose if air is excluded. the moment oxygen is introduced, as a result of human activity, sulphuric acid is formed from pyrite. Attempts to transport certain medicinal waters while still retaining their properties have so far been unsuccessful . In those waters, whose efficacy is in part attributable to their content of certain unstable ir on compounds, evi- dence of decay due to the entry of ai r and light can already be detected - although on first inspection everything app ears to have been retained in the later qualitatively and quantitatively. A certain length of time after dis- charging from the mouth of the spring, all radioactive waters lose a great deal of their medicinal effect. Their em anational activity is greatest in very early stages, and when conducted in pipelines this can only be maintained with the implementation of very spec ific precautionary measures. Naturally, this is also valid for other types of water. In Professor Dittler's op inion, if radioactive gas is added to medicinal later mechanically, it already loses half of its activity within four days, acording to L. Winkler, the oxygen content of water lies between 6cm 3 and"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"8 cm 3 per l it re of water, depending upon the water temperature. This quanti- ty is very slight compared to the amount of soluble carbon-dioxide in one litre of water, which decreases from 1500cm 3 to 1000cm 3 as the temperature rises from +4°C to +15°C. In general great care should be taken to ensure that the hydrogen i on concentration (pH) does not fall belo w 0.7 x 10 = pH7, since the aggressiveness of the oxygen will eventually damage the supply pipe. In addition the water's dissolved carbonates will also be precipitated as a result of the oxygen's activity. Experiments carried out in order to determine the relation between water temperature and external effects of a purely mechanical nature have yielded no satisfactory result. Kerner tried to establish formulae demonstrating that the temperature t of a spring is a function of altitude and the petrographical composition of the mountain range. Thus, in the case of the sp rings at the foot of surface moraines in the Dolomites, for example, he presents the equation t = 8.00 - 0.13h according to which water temperature should decreas e by about 1°C (1.8°F) with an increase in altit ude in the order of 200-300m (600-900ft). However, J. Stiny states that the functional relati onship between altitude and water tem- perature should not to be adhered to too rigidly, since many other factors are also involved, including the 'motility of the air'. Keilhack refers to heat influences ac tive in the water itself, resulting from processes of oxidation and hydrate fo rmation. Because of this function, these quantities of heat attain cons iderable importance. Where carbone appears in the concentrated form of hard pit-coal or brown coal, an addi- tional heating effect occurs which is conditioned by the oxidation or com- bustion of coal seams in the interior of the Earth. A phenomenon occurring in many places re lates to the fact that springs deliver cooler water and rise high er in summer th an in winter. 35 In summer a positive temperature gradient exists from the stratosphere to the lithosphere. During this period cold, once strongly-oxygenated snow meltwater emerges into the light of day. In winter, on the other hand, there is a negative temperature gradient from the atmosphere to the lithosphere, and frozen ground prevents the infiltrati on of surface water so that the rela- tively oxygen-deficient water that inf iltrated during the summer rises from the depths. In both cases the water has had an opportunity to charge itself with carbones over an extended period, and to restructure and ennoble itself appropriately under the influence of a favourable temperature gradi- ent, with the result that such springs deliver excelle nt water. Both the length of time available for the water's proc esses of ennoblement inside the Earth, 35 See \"Temperature and the Movement of Water\", latter part of footnote 44 - Ed."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"and the oxygen content of the initial parent water are decisive. This is because if water richer in oxygen can reach deep levels, constituting processes take place in more lively fashion. Since snow meltwater sinking deeply into the cool layers of the ground has a greater content of oxygen than ordinary rainwater, it hence follo ws that cooler water appearing in s ummer must also be of a higher quality. Many a hydraulic finding (today view ed from a purely mechanical stand- point, with scant consideration given to its physical aspect), will lead to an entirely different line of reasoning once phy sical factors referred to so far are ta ken into account. The result of this fundamentally different way of look- ing at things - from a physical instead of a merely mechanical point of view - is that my discoveries will never be incorporated into the contemporary co mplex of hydraulic opinion. My ideas will not be understood as long as ad herence to the current one-sided approach persists. This applies to con- temporary river-regulation as well, and es pecially to the in ternal destruc- t i o n of water's character through its use as a raw material for machines. (The disastrous consequences caused by modern forestry are discussed more fully in The Fertile Earth, Vol. III of Eco-Technology). In recent years even chemistry has come to realise that it is totally inadequate to characterise a water or a medicinal water quantitativel y or qualitatively by its given com- pounds of salt alone. The restructuring processes constantly taking place in Nature can readily be emulated artificially in order to pr oduce healthy, ripe water, once appro- priate physical forms in which n ecessary restructuring processes can pro- ceed can be manufactured. The change in freezing and boiling poi nts, evident in certain types of water, led to the finding that the freezing point of aqueous solutions is dependent on the number of molecules contained in one litre of water. Electro-chemistry was the first to take an approximately-correct path, in that it began to provide evidence of what really matters here. Whereas a solution of many organic substances (organic in the sense of modern chemistry) con- ducts very little electric current or no ne at all, precisely those substances (carbones) contained in various types of water are classified as electrolytes. If the dissolving of carbone groups char acteristic of water and medicinal water is properly carried out, ionisati on can also occur without application of a low-voltage current. The fact th at the conduction of electric current through aqueous solutions has been su ccessfully achieved (in which ionisa- tion of saline solutions occurs naturally without a detectable loss of electri- cal energy), provides proof of the above axiom. This phenomenon becomes all the more understandable and also gains in practical value when the explanation of the true nature of electricity is taken into account [see The F ertile Earth, Vol. III of Eco-Technology]."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" Fig. 12: Apparatus for the preparation of high-grade water.

"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Temperature and the Movement of Water With other relevant texts on River Engineering Between 1928 and the early 1930s, Viktor Schauberger was responsible for the building of nine successful - if hydrauli cally unconventional - log-flumes for the economic, damage-free transport of timber from inaccessible locations. As a result, the then Austrian govern ment commissioned Professor Philipp Forchheimer, a recently retired and hi ghly respected hydrologist of world renown, to study and report on Viktor Schauberger's theories and their practical implementation. Through their subsequent close association, not only did the two men gradually become firm friends, but Forchheimer became wholly con- vinced of the accuracy of Schauberger's th eories and, in particular, the hitherto totally disregarded function of temperature as a vital factor in hydraulics and hydrology. So completely converted to Sc hauberger's pathfindi ng discoveries did Forchheimer become that he eventually confided to Vikt or that he was glad to have retired, since he might otherwise hum iliatingly have had to admit to his for- mer students that most of what he had taught them was wrong. This eventually resulted in the writing of Schauberger's first scientific treatise on temperature-related water movement entitled Turbulence. How this all came about is explained in the following article from Implosion Magazine (No.8) on Schauberger's visit to the Technical Univer sity for Agricultural Science. The sub- stance of this treatise was based partly on Schauberger's centuri es-old family con- nection with log rafting and, more recently, on his experiences with log flumes - in both of which water temperature played a crucially important role. Professor Wilhelm Exner, President of the Austrian Academy of Science ensured that this treatise was deposited under seal at the Academy on the 24th of January 1930, which was done under his personal supe rvision and witnessed by Corvette Captain Descowitz. The purpose was both to establish Viktor Schauberger's pri- ority in intellectual property and to preser ve it until such time as the hydrological world was ready to receive and to understand it. As further confirmation of his change of heart, Forchheimer then requested Schauberger to write a complete scientific exposition of his theories under the gen- eral banner of Temperature and the Movement of Water, which was to encompass all aspects of water resources management, water treatment and supply, dam construc- tion and hydroelectric power production. Using his powerful personal influence, Forchheimer then persuaded the editor of Die Wasserwirtschaft, the Austrian Journal of Hydrology, to publish them - a move that caused much opprobrium in "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"scientific and hydrological circles. Since the readership of Die Wasserwirtschaft encompassed universities and institutes generally concerned with river regulation, hydrology and hydraulics, the various pa pers of Viktor Schauberger's that appeared were not aimed at the general publ ic, but written specifically for the rele- vant specialists. This explains why they were couched in current river engineering and hydraulic terminology. Publication of these important treatises regrettably ceased upon Professor Forchheime r's death in 1931. - [Editor] River Regulation - My Visit to the Technical University for Agricultural Science [Extracts from an article from Implosion Magazine, 8,1945.] \"If I am a fool then it is no misfort une, for then only one more fool will wander this Earth. Amongst the milli ons of mentally deranged it would barely be noticed. But what if I am not a fool, and that science itself has erred? Then the tragedy is incalculable!\" [Implosion Magazine, No.51, p.29) I did not visit the Technical University for Agricultural Sc ience to learn. My purpose was to give a lecture on naturalesque river regulation to the teach- ing staff. It all happened like this. Th e world-famous hydrologist Professor Philipp Forchheimer was appointed by the then Ministry for Land and Forests to give his expert opinion on the log flume I designed and built at Neuberg in Steiermark. In the of ficial commissioning report it was described as a technical wonder, because logs that were heavier than water beech, larch, etc) swam in it like fish. In add ition to this, the installation inexplicably achieved a 90% saving in running costs compared with usual systems of log rafting. Professor Forchheimer studied the lo g flume for about six weeks without discovering how and why it refuted the hi therto supposedly irrefutable con- formities with natural law. At the time I had no particular desire to divulge the secret. The professor, whose current outlook had received a nasty shock, therefore persuaded me to hold a que stion-and-answer session with the assembled body of teaching st aff at the above Institute. When I arrived I was taken up to the fi rst floor into a large lecture room where about ten professors, including eminent hydraulic engineers, were foregathered. Professor Forchheimer fi rst introduced me to the rector and then to the others with an inclusive gesture. I was led up to the president's chair at the head of the table and with a inscrutable smile and a wave of the hand I was invited to take a seat. The general demeanour of the rector and the smirks on the faces of the other lecturers persuaded me to handle this worthy company in my own way. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The Rector opened the discussion with the words, \"Well, Wildmeister, would you be so kind as to inform us how we, as experts, should regulate our rivers naturalesquely (and here he laid particular emphasis on the word), so that as a result of these measures no erosion or water damage will ensue, but - and this you have already stated publicly - that advant ageous after-effects only will be produced throughout the whole chain of evolution, as the ecological outcome of naturalesque methods of regulation.\" After a moment's pause for reflection, I replied, \"Naturalesque river engineering is not easily explained in a few words.\" \"Come now\", interjected the Rector, \"perhaps you can highlight the essence of the matter with a few short phrases. Please k eep it as brief and to the point as possi- ble\". To which I answered, \"In the same way that a boar passes water\", wherein I stressed each individual word. The effect of this unexpected reply was as I had anticipated and desired - to shake them out of their complacency. At the end of a brief silence, and playing with his pencil, the rector addressed me very condescendingly. \"Wildmeister, we would be glad if you could choose your words more carefully and above all expre ss yourself in more practical terms.\" At this juncture Professor Forchheimer stood up and declared, \"Your Excellency, gentlemen, I consider that Mr Schauberger's answer not only hits the nail on the head, but that it is also entirel y accurate factually. Please follow me to t he blackboard!\" Having arrived there, he completely covered the large black- board from top to bottom with fo rmulae totally unknown and incompre- hensible to me. He did it with such gusto that he broke the chalk several times, throwing the pieces angrily as ide. The rector looked on unwillingly and nervously drew himself together. Very soon the upper section of the blackboard was full, and with a great heave, Forchheimer shoved it up and half-filled the lower s ection with formulae. Then he stood back and began to give a lecture. Naturally I was unable to understand a word he was saying. This then developed into a debate lasting some two hours, which was only termin ated when an attendant appeared and reminded the rector of an appoint ment. The rector then excused himself quickly, shook my hand and said, \"We must discuss this matter again, but in greater detail\". With this my first and last visit to the Technical University for Agricultural Science came to an end. Professor Forchheimer took me by th e arm and asked me to accompany him. He even forgot to take leave of his colleagues, to whom I quickly said good-bye, and swept impatiently out of the room. At the door he looked at his watch, was horrified to see how time had flow n, and said quickly, \"Come to my house at nine o'clock tomorrow morning and then we can discuss this highly interesting matter in peace and quiet. I wish you had told me about this much earli- er on, because it would be wort h devoting a whole textbook to it\". I nodded my agreement to his suggestion and then, ad justing his top-hat, he marched off. The following morning I appeared punctually at 21 Peter Jordan Strasse."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Forchheimer immediately came to the point. \"Well now, let us discuss the curve you talked about yesterday in far greater detail. But before doing so, please explain how you arrived at the comparison with the boar. It is really very apt, but why this example?\" \"Actually it doesn't come from me\", I replied, \"but from my father, who with these same words explained to his foresters how to arrange a log- rafting stream naturalesquely so that very heavy logs are able to float\". Professor Forch heimer looked at me in surprise a nd then I began to explain the con- c ept of ' arranging' an d its purpose. \"The floatation of logs in the Klafferbach was an art requiring very special knowl- edge. Firstly there was only just enough water for the heavy logs, and secondly the bends were tight, which only a good 'arrangement' was able to overcome. The pur- pose of this arrangement was to accelerat e the passage of the logs with brake- curves. \"Just a moment!\" the professor interrupted, \"You mean that the water has to be braked in order to be accelerat ed? Not a bad idea, because in the process the water becomes compressed and its momentum increased.\" \"Not so, professor, that is not what I meant. The aim of these brak e-curves is primarily to make the water rotate spirally about its own axis, like it does above every plug-hole.\" The professor scribbled someth ing on his notepad, fiddled with his pencil and impatiently pressed me to continue. \"Professor, have you ever watched a boar when it is urinating?\" He shook his head. \"Well then, try to imagine the shap e of the curve produced by the flow of urine when the boar is running.\" \"Tha t would be the most ideal cycloid space- curve, and it could not be constructed more beautifully\", exclaimed the professor. After this observation, he tried to draw this peculiar curve, but quickly gave up. It is very difficult to draw, because the el evation is the sa me as the plan. He then tried to calculate it while I sat quietly and watched. He scratched first one ear and then the other, thro wing away one sheet of paper after the next. He then declared that the curve would take years to calculate, even if the present state of math ematics was up to it. \"Professor\", I replied, \"we are here concerned with a curve in which and through which life evolves\". This led to a lengthy, wide-ranging, philosophical discussion which mainly revolved around the indefinable concept of 'life'. Finally the professor said, \"I am a Jew and cannot agree. If you turn me upside down, all that will fall out are formulae. You think in a space that only you and no- one else knows - and therefore we cannot make any headway.\" On my way home I met the well-known author and former naval officer Captain Deskovic, to whom I relate d all that had ha ppened. A few days later h e called on me and invited me to visit His Excellency Professor Wilhelm Exner, who had a burning intere st in my theories. Exner's welcome was very cordial, and he immediately enquired, \"Do you know anything about the brake-curves that maintain water's steady flow down steep gradients?\". When I answered in the affirmative, he continued, \"Please understand me correctly. I"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"do not mean any mechan ical brake, but an inner safety brake\". H e then called out to a n elderly housekeeper for a cigar and requested that I explain my con- ception of this inner water-brake, because it was a problem that had tor- mented him for years. \"Before answering your question, your Excellency, I must first tell you how I view water and what I consider it to be.\" Exner smiled enigmatically, \"As you will\", and invited me to continue. \"Were water actually what hydrologists deem it to be - a chemically-inert substance - then a long time ago there would already have been no water and no life on this Ea rth. I regard water as the blood of the Earth. Its internal process, while not identical to that of our blood, is nonetheless very similar. It is this process that gives water its movement. I would compare this inner motion, the origin of all possible physical movement, to that of a blossoming flower bud. As it unfolds, it creates a vortex-like crown of petals, in the centre and at the end of which stands the true secret of motion - life in statu nascendi, in the form of a concentration of movement. \"I look upon this unfolding as the biol ogical sequel to a preceding concentration of energy-matter (dynagen). It is the outcome of a form of radiation, which I view as a highly organised, vibratory process. Life itself, which springs forth as the final product of unfoldment from this ur-fundamen t, is the highest conceivable concen- tration of dynagen. Through the agency of external environmental influences, and having manifested itself as a unique and unpa ralleled ostensible birth (because it is a precipitate), this concentration unfolds itself for the last time within a fraction of a second, only then to be extinguished. Whatever remains behind is a physical fruit comprised of raw materials in which inner levitative forces wane and which solidi- fies under the concentrating forms of heat generated by the incident light of the Sun. \"In water the meanders continually bring about processes of concentration and unfolding. In a certain sense they represent \"water-blossoms\" , out of which growing radiation-emitting calyxes, or funnels, develop in an upstream direction. In their direct effect they are the cause of the braking of older (de-energised) river-water. The faster water drains down steep gradients - where it receives various impact-related impulses arising from encounters with resi stances such as stones - the more power- ful the reactive forces of recoil become. Th ese, through the eruption (expansion) of the unfolding water-calyxes in an upstream direction, brake the apparently unre- strained flow on steep inclines as a re sult of these inner processes of growth? 36 The secret of the outgrowth of new water, wh ich takes place in the opposite direction to the flow, is concealed in the cycloid space-curve motion through which the water is made to pulsate.\" Professor Exner then told me that he had more or less understood what I had said, and that I should speak to no-one else about it. \"Please try to write 36 The lateral expansion of developing vortices rest ricts the space available for forward flow. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"down all that you ha ve clearly stated, in s imple language. I will then seal it, unread, in your pretence and deposit it in the Academy of Science for use in the future. I am the chairman of the Academy, and I will see to it that your authorship rights are protected. I'll discuss this with Deskovic so that he can arrange for a cover note.\" This he did. I never saw Exner again because he died sh ortly thereafter. Later on Professor Forc hheimer informed me, \"I will be responsible for these expositions, and now you will be able to write about them in Die Wasserwirtschaft. However, please give me the manuscript to edit.\" This is how my writings eventually came to be published - though later they were pro- scribed. Forchheimer then declared categorically that I should accompany him the following day to meet Profe ssor Schocklitz and Professor Smorcek in Briinn. Professor Schock litz showed us around hi s laboratory. He proudly showed us some glass plates across which water was flowing. This pro- voked the comment that I had never s een water flowing over such glass plates in Nature. As Professor Schocklitz took this remark greatly amiss, I diverted the conversation towards a turbine-blade lying in a corner, heavily pitted by the effe cts of cavitation. Professor Schocklitz apparently had no idea of the decomposive after- effects of dynamitic substances, 37 which explained these cavitation-related phenomena in steel turbine-bl ades. Accordi ng to the book Deutsche Physik these energy-precipitates, which range th emselves in a particular direction, develop a peak performan ce of the order of 32,000 atmosphe res and involve precisely the opposite products of synthe sis. These I discussed in detail with Professor Smorcek, director of the univ ersity, immediately afterwards in his workshop - a 'workshop' is the only wa y such laboratories can be described, since they take no heed of the inner dynamic processes in water. I drew Professor Smorcek's attention to the different effects of formative and destructive products of synthesis. Although he seemed very interested, no further contact with hi m eventuated. He said he would soon be return- ing to Vienna and would like to take me to meet Professor Schaffernak, director of the hydrology department at the univers ity, in order to discuss this and other questions. Professor Forchheimer declined the invitation and explained that it would serve no purpose , since Schaffernak was too materi- alist. He could not explain, for example, why the waters of the Danube and the river Inn did not mix immediately at their confluence , but only much later and further downstream. This vi sit actually took place with Professor Smorcek present. I explained this phe nomenon as arising from different conditions of tension and temperature which permit the wate rs to mix only after they themselves have first come to a state of common thermal and energetic eq uilibrium. 37 Dynamitic substances: the violent, concentrated effect of oxygen in spacially-compressed, carbone- hungry form. - Ed.. "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Professor Schaffernak looked at mo strangely and asked how I came upon such an idea. He asked some other questions too, through which I realised that he too viewed water as a chemically-inert substance, and its finely dispersed sedimentary matter, the bacteriophagous threshold matter in its most highly evolved state, as \"impurities\" in the blood of the Earth. In reality, these are the true sources from which negatively-charged fructigenic potencies are created. They intermix with descending, finely-dispersed and dosed seminal matter (oxygen). Through this interaction, wate r \"comes to life\", and begins to pulsate. A more comprehensive understanding of these processes was impossible for any of these scholars. It was only Professor Forchheimer who later mur- mured reflectively, \"I'm glad I'm already 75 years old. You cannot harm me any- more. The time will come, however, when you will be understood\". Over the course of the y ears I had many occasions to speak with scientists of world repute about the concept of \"atomic disintegration and formation\". In Berlin, just before he was taken into custody, th e famous physicist, natur- al scientist and Privy Councillor, Max Planck, was called in as an expert adviser during an in terview I had with Herr Hitl er. He only looked at me intently, but said nothing about my vi ews. What he did say, however, was, \"Science has nothing to do with Nature\". He then took me to the chief chemist a t the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. This conversation had disastrous conse- quences for me. I only mention it here merely to point out the dangers that arise if one discusses such matters with people who feel that their research has taken a wrong turn, but who want to maintain their own livelihood. Naturalesque river regulation will only be understood after the inner process of motion outlined above has become common knowledge. For this a long period of re-education will pe rhaps become necessary. But first the tragic repercussions of today's purel y mechanistic methods of river engi- neering will have to become starkly apparent through the occurrence of the most disastrous events . Everything we see around us, or are otherwise aware of, came into being through cy cloid space-curve motion, which is the basis of self-renewal and evolution. It is a form of motion th at can only arise when, owing to the braking resistances of the riverbank (the effect of mean- ders) the forward motion of the water is translated into a rotational one. Shortly before his death, Forchheimer attributed cycloid brake-curves to me in his unfinished book. With this book, Forchheimer intended to refute everything he had implanted into millions of brains with his textbooks - he had taught that water had to be channelled as fast as possible by the steep- est, straightest and shortest route from mountain to valle y, so that it could flow into the sea having done as little harm as possible. During this final perio d, Professor Forchheimer al so realised that with this, he, as a leading hydrologist, had made the greatest teaching mistake of his life by destroying th e naturalesque devel opmental pathway along"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"which, in a rhythmic sequence, the forward fl ow of water is intermixed with formative and transformati ve rotational motion. At the inte rsection of these alternating movements/ under certain other specific preconditions, the for- mative, reproductive and upwardly-evoluting power of fructigenic matter is released (see fig. 13 and refe r to figs. 4 - 6 also). This becomes uni-polar, and so highly active that it is able to bind whatever the corraded river-gravel disperses into the water, or whatever the gills of the trout eject to promote their own mobility. In thes e life-renewing processes, whatever then radiates and expands upstream out of the calyx- like water-formations, as a surplus, conceals the riddle - water. As a result of cooling influences, reinfo rced by naturalesq ue plantation of the riverbanks, negatively-charged fructig ens become highly active. Finely distributed around the external surfaces of the water-calyx, the 'aggressor' is to be found - the oxygen which becomes aggressive with warming and leads to a build-up of heat. It is only in this spacially-dimi nished (dispersed) and internally-passive state induced by co ld influences, that the \"aggressor\" can be consumed (enveloped and bound) by what Goethe called the Eternally Female' and th e 'All-Uplifting' (the carbones and fructigens). However, if as a result of the elim ination of cycloid space-curves in straight-channelled river regulations, th e naturalesque evolutionary curve is lost and with it the possibility for self -renewal, then wate r becomes stale, insipid and sick. With this everything th at owes its existence, its physical well-being and its increase in mental vigour to the water also disappears. Most importantly of all, it is quite futile to work towards an im provement in the present standard of living as long as the Blood of the Earth, the apparent- ly ordinary-looking water that faithfully accompanies us from the cradle to the grave, is not given b ack its matriarchal rights. With thes e it can consume the \"aggressor\" in such a condition th at self-renewal is not harmed - but which as the ultimate precipitate can only be put to good use. In this regard mechanical influence alone is insufficient. By means of a deterrent cold influ- ence the inner destructive fury must fi rst be removed from what has been dispersed, and this is done with the use of cycloid space-curve motion.

Docum ented variations in temperature yielded values arithmetically too s mall for any noteworthy effect on the results to be inferred. It must be emphasised that the internal variations in water temperature are a result of the differences between the temp erature of the water and the medium surrounding it. If internal variations in water temp erature are ignored, then the signifi- cance of differences between water a nd air or external temperature and therefore the cause of the water cycle, will likewise be nega ted. No word can truly express the vital ro le of the water cycle fo r all life on the Earth. Of equal importance, if less obvious, are the effects of variations in tempera- ture within the water itself, as will be shown later. Up to now such variations have been disregarded as immaterial for the purposes of all hydraulic calcu- lation. Observations over many years, practical experiments and correctly carried-out measurements have proved that it is absolutely imperative to take internal variations in water temperature into account. Their very exclusion - elimination is out of the question - makes all practical use and exploitation of water impossible. The u nderstanding alone of the important effe ct of these vari- ations compels the reappraisal and revision of the fundamental bases of current- ly-held theories relating to the whole sphere of river engineering. A new, hitherto neglected, but extremely vital factor is now added: the changes induced in the inner state of water through the stratification result- ing from differences in temperature. Were this factor to be integrated into conventional theory , we would have to learn to reformulate our ideas about fundamental principles. There is another omission in contem porary theory about the formation of many springs. Apart fr om commonly-known seepag e springs where water above impervious strata is brought to the surface by gravity, there are also springs, lying far above any possible accumulation of water, which, break- ing all known laws, surface rather like artesian wells much higher than the main water table. An example is a spring on the High Priel, which rises about 100m (330ft) below the summit, at an altitude of over 2,000m (6,500ft), and discharges wate r all year round. 38 While it is not our purpose to explain the emergence of sp rings in general, the principles involved in these observations should be outlined briefly. In 38 Mr Loew, a chief departmental engineer, also peaks, the Dzamaleu and the Pictrossa, were separat- describes the following case: \"In the Bukowina ed from the spring by depressions lying far below it, district a very cold, much sought-after spring, pro- the question remains open as to the origin of the ductive all year round, rose at the north-western spring's strong and constant flow.

Eventually it reaches a level with a temperature of +4 °C (39.2°F). Naturally this decisive stratum (the centre stratum) is not horizontal, but roughl y follows the configuration of the Earth's surface. The +4°C water impregnating it has a specific density of 1. Above and below the centre stratum the water gradually decreases in den- sity. This water is therefore confined between two strata of different densi- ties. Since their temperatures diverg e from +4°C, they both endeavour to expand, thus exerting pressure on the centre stratum, which increases com- mensurately the greater the distance from this stratu m. After the forces have reached equilibrium, the water in the centre stratum drains down the bed- gradient towards the lower side of th e geological formation. The water stra- ta surrounding the centre stratum, however, are never exposed to the same pressure. Whichever of the two is exposed to greater pressure, it is fo rced back into the centre stratum. It re-acclimatises itself (to 4°C) and moves away down- wards. According to the configuration of the ground surface, one or other of the enclosing strata soon comes under greater pressure and hence the centre stratum is fed alternately from above and below. This is how it is possible for water to emerge as a spring at such heights. These high springs always exhibit temperatures very close to +4°C. The logical presumption is that the movement of spring water takes place within the centre stratum. The fact that water cannot be co mpressed at +4°C (39.2°F) may also play a certain role he re - it must either yield to the pres- sure and make its way to the surface, or its temperature must adapt to the pressure. The latter occurs when the water in the centre stratum encounters an insurmountable obstacle. It is then absorbed into the neighbouring strata, and in this somewhat circuitous fashion it re-enters the centre-stratum by way of assimilation. Enormous quantities of water are raised to immense heights hourly (through evaporation) and equally large volumes of subterranean water are forced upwards or expressed as spri ngs on the highest mountain peaks. In both cases it is the hitherto ignored di fferences in temperature that continu- ally disturb the state of equilibrium to such an extent. Small causes, too commonplace to be noticed, produce large effects. To return to the actual theme - the eff ect of internal variations in water temperature on the movement of the water itself: It mu st be pointed out that these differences in water temperature would appear totally to preclude any state of rest in the water-body itself. Even in apparently motionless water very considerable movements occur - th ey are able to se t large quantities of logs in motion. If an oste nsibly still stretch of wate r is exposed to the Sun on one side only, then an inclined plane (thermocli ne) is formed through the "},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"warming of the water surface in the insolated area, which induces a fl ow towards the colder side and results in the formation of circulating currents. Therefore, even without a bed-gradient movement of the water ta kes place. When water, comprising strata of different temperatures and therefore of different densities, flows down a riverbed gradient, these layers travel alonggside and above each other for a long period without mixing. The move- ment of every single particle of water down a given gradient is linked to a very par- ticular velocity, which corresponds to its specific weight. If its specific weight is altered by the gradient (greater veloc ity, greater friction, increase in vol- ume), then the water is unable to adjust itself readily to the new velocity without a transitional phase. The same thing happens when the sp ecific weight is modified by outside influences, such as solar radiation. The water breaks, or in more common parlance, becomes turbulent, which is the activation of a hitherto-unrecognised precision brake in moving water, which operates with marvellous automatici- ty and which is normally actuated by the external temperature. The greater flow-velocity in cool weather and du ring the night suffices to change the water's volume and weight. The temp erature of all the water filaments approaces +4°C, and henc e density 1. As a result their specific weight ought to conform to the increase in velocity - in which case a constant increase in the rate of flow should occur. However, through the increase in flow velocity, the friction between water particles themselves and between water particles and channel surfaces will be intensified, resulting in a rise in t e m p e r a t u r e and a consequent increase in volume. The picture thus emerges that: • on the one hand an increase in flow-v elocity occurs, and on the other a decrease in specific weight; • the water filaments rupture and the water becomes 'turbulent'. • the forward motion of the water will be resolved into the formation of vortices. The greater the velocity of forward motion, the greater or more intense the formation of vortices. At a certain velocity this assumes such a violent nature that water can actually be atomised in the water-body itself, a phenome- non that manifests itself as a cloud-like formation. In summary it can therefore be stated that turbulence is the interruption of the forward motion of flowing water. It occurs in the axis of flow (the position of greatest increase in velocity) in conformity with natural law, and arises due to the fact that in water each and every specific weight corresponds to a particular velocity. Turbulence therefore represents the automatic activation of a compen-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"satory motion. It is the a utomatic and double -safe brake in all flowing water and in every channel. Through knowledge of the spring and the way it co mes into being, and with a clear understanding of the func tion of turbulence, every possible way to make use of water practically in accordance with natural law, and there- fore without limitation, is made available to humanity. 0 000 00000 Deriving from above are the following guiding principles and basic propositions and with them the compelling necessity for the restructuring of the whole body of water resources management. 00000000 00000 000 0 Everything flows, and all processes in the atmosphere are reflected in the interior of the Earth. Guiding principles: 1. The body of water passing through a channel profile is never a homoge- neous mass, but always exhibits strata of different temperatures. 2. In all channels the relati on between flow-velocity and bed-gradient is pri- marily dependent on the thermal stratific ation of the water. 3. The channel profile affects the flow ve locity to the extent that its form and composition exert an influence on the differences in the temperature of the individual water-strata, 4. The profile is a product of the processes that take place within the flowing body of water itself.

Since this has arous ed my keen interest, due to the entirely new points of view it presents, which w ill not only be fruitful but pioneering in relation to dam construction and river regu lation, I consider it to be in the public interest that this work be made known to a wider readership and the scientific world. With this in mind, I recommend the publication of this interesting article. Yours faithfully, FORCHHEIMER, m.p. Preamble The increasing frequency of catastrophic floods in recent year s, and the con- stantly increasing aridity in many areas, raise the question as to whether, in conjunction with other measures inaugurated by human hand, arbitrary systems of water resources management are not in part to blame for these evils. We are here concerned primarily with two factors, which need to be examined with this in mind: contempo rary methods of river regulation and the increase in forest clearance. Before addressing the theme itself, attention should be drawn to a very important factor hitherto ignored in all hydraulic engineering practices: the temperature of water in relation to soil and air temperature as well as the internal variations in temperature (temperature gradients) in flowing or standing water. S ince even small differences in temp erature suffice to bring about obvious changes in the state of aggregation of water (solid, liquid and gaseous), it is quite easy to understand that larger variations in the internal temperature of flowing or standing water must have a decisive influence on its movement in and over the Earth. In the following section the hitherto-neglected inter- relations between temperature and the movement of water will be addressed, and those errors will be id entified which have arisen through disregard of this vital interaction. Temperature Gradients - Full & Half Hydrological Cycles The movement and distri bution of water returnin g to the ground surface from the atmosphere is conditioned by the prevailing rainwater tempera- ture and by the temperature of the surrounding air and ground strata. If the temperature of the incident water is higher than the ground strata"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"supposed to absorb i t , then through cooling and becoming specifically heav- uer as a result, rainwater will readily be able to infiltrate the in terior of the E a r t h . After having attained a temperature of +4°C (+39.2°F - also its condi- tion of greatest density) and by sinking further, the water eventually arrives at strata of higher temper ature, and by accommodat ing itself to these tem- peratures it becomes specifically lighter. The further it sinks due to the pressu re from the heavier water above, the greater its inherent resi stance to downward moveme nt, owing to its con- stant l y reducing specific weig ht. Finally a state of equilibrium is established through which the all-important height of the groundwater table is regulat- ed. 39 Under very particular conditions of pr essure, a water stratum with a temperature of +4°C (the centre stratum) is formed within the general body of groundwater. In the case described above we are concerned with a posi- tive temperature gradient, which is the rate of change per unit length between the temperature of the incident rain water and that of the ground, expressed arithmetically. This case also represents the Full Cycle of water, the full hydrological cycle. In reiteration of what has been st ated earlier, this is characterised by the followin g phases: • infiltration of water into the Earth; • passage through the +4°C centre-stratum of the groundwater; • purification at th is temperature; 40 • further sinking into subterranean aquifers due to its own weight; • transition to a vaporous state due to strong geothermal influences; • rising again towards the ground-surface with a simultaneous uptake of nutrients; • cooling of the water an d deposition of nutrients; • draining away over the ground-surface; • evaporating and forming clouds; • falling again as rain, and so on. In warm soils the +4°C groundwater stratum is missing. Hence the coun- terweight to the upward pressure from be low is also absent. If the tempera- ture of rainwater is lower than the uppermost ground-stratum, then the 39 The weight of the +4° C water thrusts the greater or lesser extent precipitates its content lower, specifically lighter water downwards, of salts and other substances due to its dimin- which due to the rising temperatures thus ished dissolving capacity, until at +4°C (39.2°F) encountered, becomes even less dense and it r eaches the state where its capacity to hold hence develops an increasing resistance to fur- salts and other substances in solution is at a ther downward movement through its expan- mi nimum.

Finally it is forced up to the surface again by the pres- sure from below and, provided it does not evaporate immediately, drains away along the riverbed-gradient. In this case we are concerned with a negative temperature gradient (water temperature lower than the surface-tem perature of the ground). The full cycle no longer develops, but only a Half Cycle, namely precipitation of water earthwards, surface run-off, ev aporation, cloud formation and re-pre- cipitation as rain. The following may throw more light on the temperature gradient and help in better understanding what is to be discussed later. When an initially-negative temperature gradient (warm earth, cold rain) is coupled with a simultaneous drop in at mospheric temperature, the ground can be cooled to such a degree that the te mperature gradient ceases to exist. The same thing can also happen with an initially-posi tive temperature gradient, if the infiltrating water is of sufficient quantity to warm the ground. In both cases, when a zero temperature gradient occurs , the drainage is conditioned by the actual riverbed-gradient until such time as the temperature gradient is reinstat- ed through the action of friction and other factors. It is necessary in each instance to re-establish th e required temperature gr adient through the addition of water of the right temperature in order to brake the water's free and almost resistance-less flow down the inclined plane of a riverbed. The Groundwater Table The height of the groundwater table fl uctuates according to the temperature of the ground strata, whic h are also affected by the temperature of infiltrat- ing water-masses. Air temperat ure also plays a major role. Where localised impoundment of wate r-masses occurs, cold bottom- water influences the temperature of surrounding ground strata. These are cooled, and in this way a stable, positive temperature gradient is created, since in this instance rainwater will always be warmer than the colder ground. These are the preconditions for th e infiltration of rainwater. As a result, the groundwater table will not only be raised, but the absorptive capacity of the soil will also be increased laterally and vertically. The previously-described +4°C centre stratum in the groundwater will be displaced downwards owing to increased pressure from over-lying water- masses, thus overcoming the resistance to further downward penetration of warmer and specifically-lighter water ly ing below the centre stratum. This leads to the formation of a natural subt erranean reservoir, a retention basin, which inhibits rapid surface drainage and gives rise to the full hydrological "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" Fig. 14a: Original diagram of a cross-section through a groundwater reservoir Fig. 14b: Amended diagram of a cross-section through a groundwater reservoir"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"cycle. The release of water from this reservoir then follo ws. As will be described later, the lateral expansion of the centre stratum (formation of spri ngs) can also occur due to pressure acting on it from above and below. Fig. 14a 41 below, schematically illustrates a cross-section through a groundwater reservoir. This depicts how not only the late ral but also the upward flow of the centre stratum (under the greatest pressure from all other strata) can come about. In contrast, as describe d previously, high surface temperatures permit hard- ly any water to infiltrate into the ground at all. The accretion of groundwater ceases, or it only accumula tes in small quantities at great depths. Through evaporation of small residues of gr oundwater still pres ent, the ground becomes increasingly incapa ble of absorption. Due to the effect of too high a ground temperature, percolating water will develop into surface run-off, lead- ing to rapid re-evaporation connected w ith it (a half-cycle ). In this case no accretion of groundwater in the previously-d escribed sense therefore comes about. In such districts hot springs fr equently make their appearance, forced up to the surface through fissures by upward pressure from below, for which no counter-pressure exists due to th e lack of over-burdening groundwater. 42 The absorptive capacity of the ground is thus dependent on the condi- tions of temperature which give rise to the regulation of the groundwater table as described above, and hence on the existence and height of the groundwater-table. In summary it can be stated: a positiv e temperature gradient is the pre- condition for the soil's ability to ab sorb, for the accretion of groundwater and for the creation of the full hydrologica l cycles associated with it. A nega- tive temperature gradient prevents the accretion of any groundwater and gives rise to half-cycles only. 41 It is known that Viktor Schauberger was water welled up out of the old crater at unhappy with the original diagram and the Parn stall-Futterung, filling th e basin.

A thermal surface-gra- dient is now added to the physical riverbed-gradien t. A further increase in run-off velocity and the power to shift pebbles, gravel and sediment ensues. Once the present positive temperature gradient again becomes negative, bends in the river are formed in the lower reaches through turbulence, and thus a mechanical deceleration in the rate of flow occu rs. Suspended sedi- ment is deposited and the oncoming water-masses become backed up. The result: flooding. In Case 2, if saturation of the groundwater basin occurs as a result of a stable positive temperature gradient, then groundwater (springwater) that now surfaces is colder than the ground strata lying directly beneath it. The temperature gradient has been reversed and has become negative again. Rapid drainage of the heavy water-masse s follows. As a result of relatively low temperatures in the ground, cold, heavy, excess water from the Earth's interior now drains o ff, achieving a positive condition only gradually, because the specifically-heavier water warm s up very slowly. Since in the u pper third of the catchment area the slope of the riverbed is usually extremely steep, turbulence is created, and hence bends in the more hori- zontal parts of the river are formed. The further transition from a negativ e to a positive temperature gradient therefore takes place very slowly, and the incidence of strong turbulence again leads to excessively sharp horizontal bends and to the deposition of boulders, pebbles and se diment, the gouging of pot-holes and the disloca- tion of the channel bed through mech anical action. The immediate result of this type of discharge is a widening of the channe l, a heaping up of broad banks of boulder-gravel, and evapora tion or subsidence of water in the churned-up riverbed. In this process the riverbed has again been exposed to the influence of external temperature (already typical of alpine flow- regimes, and always associated with an asymmetrical profile - a deepened Loew describes the following case: 'It was in the following example available: 'My house lies July 1902 or 1903, the exact date and hour escapes high up on a mountain, and naturally water is of me.

The rupture of the riverbank is the result. In times of flood mechanical braking is effected by the bends thus formed, and banks are breached even further. The situa- tion is even worse than before and agai n the result is flood ing. In order to avert the danger of flooding co mpletely it is necessary to eliminate both extreme cases 1 & 2 artificially. By building dams incorporating appropriate provisions, thermal condi- tions and rate of discharge can once again be regulated - where these have been altered inappropriately owing to the shift in the temperatures and the associated temperature gradient of the ground strata. The discharge condi- tions of these regulating dams can be automatically adjusted thermally and quantitatively to the prevailing daytim e temperature. In this way both of these extreme cases will be avoided and will also be modi fied automatically so as to fall within the intermediate temperatures of the discharge. With increasingly finer adjustment of the simple apparatus proposed for these dams, temperature gradients suited to the mean seasonal temperature are progressively developed in the river, and in this way it is possible to reduce the danger of flooding at its in ception and gradually to avert it. There is no danger of flooding because, by adjusting the temperature of the discharge to the mean annual temperature, the correct ground tempera- ture gradient can be re-established. This results in the restoration of the absorptive capacity of the ground, the proper regulation of the groundwater table and with this, the formation of th e vitally important retention basin. Through the correct adjustment of the discharge conditions, an orderly fur- ther drainage of water over the ground su rface results. No localised evapora- tion takes place, and because of this no rapid succession of rainfall occurs, restricted to a limited area. In othe r words, the well-or dered conditions of the full cycle are re-established. Where de-watering or drainage of th e ground is desired, it is likewise possible to make unwante d, stagnant water disappear by creating a temper- ature gradient (positive temperature gr adient ) conducive to this situation. It is therefore possible to produce a full cycle or half-cycle at will. However, dams that have been constructed so far have produced half-cycles only. In this connection the meaning of full and half-cycles should again be clarified. The full hydrological cycle involves the entry of wa ter into the interi- or of the Earth, the creation of the necessary groundwater body, the deten- tion of run-off water and by this means to forestall or reduce the danger of flooding. Cold springs are also con tinuously formed, whose waters reduce the temperature of receiving streams an d help to inhibit over-rapid evapora- tion downstream. With the half-hydrological cycle, by comparison, a familiar condition occurs"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"where rising water vapour is produced almost uninterruptedly. In other words, a continuous contribution is made to the mass of atmospheric water and the recurrent precipitation associated with it. One flood therefore gives rise to the next. Basic Principles of River Regulation It is vitally important to achieve the proper condi tions of discharge not only in the above sense, but also in the regulation of waterways and the forma- tion of their banks. The aim of contemporary river-regulation practice is to effect the fastest possible drainage of water, through ba nk-rectification and bank-stabilisation with artificial structur es. This type of regulation, howev- er, is thoroughly one-sided an d does not fulfil its purpose. It cannot and should not be the task of the river-e ngineer to correct Nature. Rather, in all watercourses requiring regulation, his job should be to investi- gate Nature's processes and to emul ate Nature's examples of healthy streams. Here again the most crucial factor is the interrelation between water and air temperature, which cannot be disregarded in any regulation. The natural regulators of the draina ge of water are forests and lakes. By cooling the ground in their immediate vicinity, forests create a permanent positive temperature gradient, resulting in the formation of groundwater reservoirs which have a delaying effect on ra inwater discharge. Once again, cold springs issuing from these groundwater reservoirs quickly enter receiving streams, cool the main body of water and thereby inhibit premature evapo- ration as the water flows along the channel. The cyclical movement of water - the transfer of water from the grou nd to the atmosphere - will be slowed down and distributed spacially along the length of the watercourse. These cycles do not take pl ace over relatively sm all areas, so that one fall of rain or one flood does not necessarily give rise to the next. Where forests have been felled and natu ral lakes are absent, it is necessary to create a substitute: an artifi cial impoundment of water, which must be cor- rectly built and properly operated. Only then can it bring about the specified functions of groundwater-recharge, detention of run-off and the creation of a proper temperature gradient. Indeed, impounded lakes ar e often built to enable the orderly management of water resources. However, these ha ve not always proved satisfactory and have often achieved the oppos ite of what was desired. To be more specific: as constructed and operated today, im pounded lakes are nothing more than storers of water. They collect the wa ter and fulfil the function of rainwater detention, but almost alwa ys produce a half-cycle. The water remains on the ground surface (no infiltration) or evaporates soon after its release. "},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Precipitation in the vicinity of existi ng reservoirs becomes irregular and inc reases or decreases according to the orientation (wind direction) of the valley. The normal flow of water in the middle and lower reaches diminish- es, the groundwater table also sinks in th e middle and lower reaches for the same reason and the productivity of the soil in thes e areas noticeably declines. This happens for the sole reason that a thoroughly one-sided km perature gradient is created in the downstream flow-regime because of the way reservoirs are constructed and through the continuous release of either specifically-heavy or light water, depending on whether water is released directly from the bottom of the reservoi r or via a spillway from the top. Both types of discharge lead to the extreme cases outlined earlier and thus to the generation of half-cycles, with their well-known de trimental effect in the spawning of floods a nd the resulting damage. It is therefore the purpose of a prop erly-constructed reservoir, equipped with the requisite discharge-control systems and starting at the dam itself, to regulate the te mperature gradient of watercourses continuously in such a way that these depredati ons can be avoided with certainty. With this method of regulation of the temperature gradient, expensive but usually inadequate insta llations in the channel itself become unnecessary. Correctly-constructed reservoirs, as such, are those in which the movement of the water, th ough slight, will be enha nced by the development of a strong temperature gradient. Thus, by means of the proposed equipment, cool water strata will continuous ly and automatically reach the water surface, significantly reducing excessive evaporation - with its unwelcome consequences - which has occurred over these reservoirs up to now. Dangers of flooding can onl y be prevented in a prac tical way if, with the use of naturalesque methods of control, water is not returned to the atmos- phere as rapidly as possible - as has hither to been the case, bu t is able to ful- fil its true function. This is the es tablishment of the full cycle in its roundabout route through the Earth, and with it the supply of nutrients to the soil. It is evident that to date two cardinal errors have been committed: by draining water too rapidly over the ground surface, it is returned to the atmosphere too quickly, thereby caus ing renewed precipitation and flood- ing. More importantly, the water was thus robbed of its most important pur- pose of infiltrating into the ground. By inhibiting the full cycle, the supply of nutrients to the so il was also cut off.

The Interrelationship between Groundwater & Agriculture In the preceding section attention was drawn to the mistakes that have been made in the execution of hydraulic e ngineering projects and indications were given as to how they can be avoided. In the following, the devastating consequences that ensue from the incorrect manage ment of water resources are to be given special emphasis. Through mismanagement of waterways, not only are riverside communi- ties exposed to a direct and acute threat but, what is far worse, they are also threatened by an insidious evil, a re duction in soil pro ductivity. This mani- fests itself in the retreat of groundwater or its ot her extreme, swamp develop- ment. If we note the ch anges that have occurred in areas under food production within the space of a single generation, and if we consider that today (1930) in Austria hardly any grass grows wh ere once our grandfathers enjoyed rich farmland, it is clear to us how fast the pr oductivity of the soil is declining. For example, the areas under wheat and rye cultiv ation have fallen from 273 million hectares to 246 million over the last 30 years. This decline in yield is particularly marked in mountainous regions, which naturally are the first to feel the fu ll force of the retr eat of groundwater. On alpine pastures, where previously the rais ing of 100 head or so of cattle was of no consequence, today those with grazing rights squabble over the fodder required for a single beast. The previo usly almost inexhaustible, pastureland is today insufficient even for a fract ion of its former carrying capacity. The reason for this decline in soil fertility is purely and simply that the groundwater table has subsided and is continuing to sink further. The soil, which ought to produce a good yield, must be replenished constantly with additional ingredients required by the plants for growth. The carrier and distributor of these substa nces is the gro undwater, which in its internal cycle constantly brings up fresh nutrient salts from the interior of the Earth. 45 The same applies to rivers as applies to other hand, if we merely patch things up exter- human beings.

Questions of detail will not be dealt with here. Turbulence Phenomena in Flowing Water When an ideal liquid flows down an incl ined plane without friction, individ- ual filaments of the current ought to move along parallel to each other. Moreover, according to the law of gr avity, this motion ought to accelerate uni- formly. This never happens in Nature, however, since fricti on occurs between liquid and channel surfaces and between particles of the liquid themselves. As energy is dissipated in this proces s, motion is no longer accelerated, but is uniform - if pulsations and othe r irregularities are discounted. In the case of a non-ideal, viscous liquid, as long as water-movement is stratified (laminar) - surface friction for the mome nt excluded - a certain amount of energy is transformed into heat. At a particular velocity, which varies according to water temperatur e, laminar motion transfers into a vorti- cose, turbulent one. With turbulent motion a certain amount of energy is also converted into heat, as was demonstrated by Barnes' and Coker's experi- ments, 46 and a further amount of energy is dissipated through exchange of momenta. In this context Forchheimer states that 47 \"in vortical motion the more central flow is not only transformed into heat but also into vortices, and con- versely an acceleration of the more central motion can also possibly occur through a reduction in vortical activity, although no ex perimental evidence for this is avail- a ble\". The author's own obser vations reveal that: - turbulence is at a minimum at a water temperature of +4°C (+39.2°F) under equal conditions and in identical profiles; 46 See Forchheimer, Hydraulik, 1914, page 51. 47 See Forchheimer, Hydraulik, 1914, page 27."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"• turbulence and the associated decrease in velocity become more pro- nounced the more the water temperature diverges from +4°C; • it is possible to achiev e an acceleration in the central flow by inducing a decrease in water temp erature towards +4°C. Fig. 1 shows the exceptionally strong occurrence of turbulence and vor- tices where a hot spri ng flows into the Tepl near Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary). If the hot spring water is blocked off temp orarily, the water in the Tepl flows downstream with considerable velocity due to the pronounced slope of the stream-bed at this spot. After re-introduction of hot spring water, this is reduced immediately to an extraordinary degree. The enormous effect of water temperature on turbulence and velocity can also be observed at a log-flume in Neuberg (Steiermark). Here in a half- round, 2km (1.2 miles) l ong wooden flume, measur ements of temperature and velocity were made during the floatation of timber. In the morning when the water temperature was roughl y 9°-10°C (48.2°F - 50°F), a block of wood required about 29 minutes to cover the distance. At midday, with a water temperature of 13°- 15°C (55.4°F - 59°F) an d under otherwise equal conditions, it took 40 minutes. A further example of this concerns wate r supply to the tu rbines of a board mill in North Austria. The water suppl y consists of two 2km long concrete channels. One draws its water from the so-called Cold Murz, the other from the warmer Still Murz. The former flows towards their common intake along the shaded side of the valley, the latter on the sunny side. With the canal profile at full capacity the normal flow of water from the Still Murz amounts to about 860 litres /sec (189gals/sec). Acco rding to the observa- tions of Mr Bruckner, the factory director, and Mr Patta, th e works manager, on occasions when the water temperature of the Still Murz approaches that of the Cold Murz, and the temperature gradient in the supply canal from the Still Murz becomes positive, under certain ci rcumstances (such as at night) the volume of water increas es to 1,800 litres/sec (3 96 gals/sec). Despite the constriction of the intakes above the turbines, the output of the turbines increases, resulting in an increase in power generation equivalent to the thermal output of one wagonload of coal per night. Temperature Gradient, Riverbed Slope and River Bend Formation The formulae applied today to the calculation of flow-velocity in channels encompass geometrical profile of the channel, roughness of channel wall- surfaces and gradient (riverbed-gradient, slope of the water surface or ener- "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"gy lines). What these formulae do not take Into a ccount are the physical properties of water, such as viscosity and specific weight, which vary with temperature. However, it is important to take note of the temperature regime in the direction of flow - the te mperature gradient or rate of change in temperature per unit length in the direction of the downstream flow. The temperature gradient is described as positive when the water temperature approaches +4°C in the di rection of flow, and in th e opposite case, as nega- tive. If for example the temperature at point A of a channel is t 1 °, at a lower point B is t 2 °, and if t 1 >t 2 (positive temperature gradient ), then along this stretch an increase in velocity occurs due to a reduction in turbulence. Horizontal transverse vortex-trains a nd turbulent formations become small- er. In the opposite case, where t 1 >t 2 (negative temperature gradient), the inci- dence of turbulence increases owing to a rise in temperature and an ensuing loss in kinetic energy, which expresses itself as a decrease in velocity. The tractive force become s less and deposition of tran sported sedime nt follows. In the section relating to tractive fo rce and the movement of sediment, Robert Weyrauch states in his book, Hydraulic Calculation: 48 \"S 0 , [boundary shear force 49 ] is dependent on the provenance of the sediment, and is therefore constant for a relatively short stretch of river without the presence of affluent streams. In the case of longer stretches without affluent streams it dimin- ishes in a downstream direction.\" In the above example the reason for this is obvi ous - a case of negative temperature gradient. Where secondary streams exist (which reintroduce colder water into the main stream and thus usually effect an increase in flow-velocity through a reduction in turbulence), weakening of the tractive force does not occur. Tractive force is maintained or increases with a positive temperature gradient and decreases with a negative temperature gradient. This phenomenon becomes all the more important when studying changes in the riverbed. Assuming a uni form discharge of water, the bed- gradient remains constant, or will b ecome greater with a positive tempera- ture gradient and smaller with a negative temperature gradient. Where the volume of water increases in conjunc tion with a negative temperature gra- dient, the morphology of the riverbed itself is not substantially altered, whereas under these conditions ruptures of the bank do occur as the central axis of the current oscillat es from one side to the ot her. With an increase in the volume of water and a positive temper ature gradient, the riverbed will be attacked and deepened. The watercourse straightens out and river bends previously formed through deposition of sedime nt will be evened out. Under certain circumstan ces, with a sudden drop in temperature and 48 Hydraulisches Rechnen, 4th edition, page 68. - VS 49 See footnote 3. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"atmospheric pressure (such as clear sk ies after a flood), especially at night, the descending flow of water can beco me even more dangerous than quan- t itatively greater masses of water under a negative temperature gradient in warm, rainy weather conditions. The mean central riverbed gradient which develops over the course of time is affected by the mean annual discharge and the temperature gradient corresponding to the mean annual temp erature, wherein the mean annual temperature and the amount of rainfall ar e to a certain extent interrelated. In those years where larger fluctuations in the mean annual temperature occur, there will also be relatively greater changes to the riverbed. Measurement of temperatures in the same river cross-section indicates that temperatures vary according to location. Also, during the course of a day the place of the greates t flow-velocity (flow-axis, central core of the cur- rent) also changes its po sition within the profile laterally as well as vertically. While the lowest temperature is always to be found in the central core of the current, it increases to a greater or lesser extent towards the periphery. During the day the line of the central ax is of flow lies clos er to the shaded bank, since that is where the heavy wa ter accumulates, whereas the lighter water flows along the sunny side. At ni ght, due to the enlargement of the heavy water side, the current core migra tes towards the centre of the chan- nel. With a negative temperature gradie nt, the current core lies close to the water surface, and with a positive temperature gradient, deeper down. During the floatation of timber the following phenomenon can be observed: if the temperature of the surroundings is lower than the water temperature (temperature gradient decidedly positiv e - water cools duri ng flow), floata- tion takes place with the grea test of ease. The logs stay in the middle of the channel and float down the clearly-defin ed central axis of the current. On warmer days, especially towards midda y, timber becomes stranded. Log-jams happen easily, because the flow axis wa nders about (transverse currents due to turbulence) and do es not keep to a centralised course for a prolonged peri- od, as it does with a positive temperature gradient. In section l-l 1 , in the stretch of river shown in fig. 15, the axis of the cur- rent still lies in the middle of the river. If the values of the mean flow-veloci- ties in each vertical of the river profile are plotted vertically, and an energy-line is drawn, then as is to be expected, the energy falls off to a greater or lesser extent towards the river's edge. If this decrease exceeds a certain limit, then it is obvious that this condition can only be unstable and even small causes will suffice to alter the status quo. If, for example, the bank at 1 is shaded 50 and the bank at 1 1 exposed to the Sun, then at 1 1 the water will be warmed, becoming specifically lighter, and 50 The initial cause can also be purely mechanical, e.g. one bank is rough, the other smooth. - VS."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" due to increased turbulence will fl ow more slowly here than at 1.

The temperature gradient in the cross-section itself, which in cross-section (2-2 1 ) was previously nega- tive from the left bank to the right, is reversed and becomes negative from right to left - for with the constant increase in the inward curvature of the current-axis towards the right (fig. 15) a flow of lighter and slower water of a higher temperature is created to the left. At the point in the cross-section where the temperature gradient reverses, a ford (cross-section 3-3 1 ) is estab- lished through the we akening of the tractive force (due to transfer of energy from the heavy water to the light water on the right bank). If the profile of the river is compared with the respectiv e energy line, it can be seen that both contours are similar. The formation of river bends occurs mainly where greater fluctuations in temperature, enhanced by climatic conditions, occur within short periods of time - as in the case of the debouchmen t of a river from mountains onto the plains. On the other hand, a straight stretch of river with regular, bilateral deposition of sediment is formed where the temperature gradient remains positive over long stretches of rive r for the greater pa rt of the year. Fig. 2 shows a stretch of the River Tepl shortly before it flows into the Eger. In this stretch the temperature gr adient is always positive, because the water, previously heated upstream by th e inflow of hot spri ngs, cools off en route.

"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Influence of the Geographical Situation and the Rotation of the Earth Apart from the influenc e of terrain and temper ature gradient outlined above, the geographical location and the rotation of the Earth (geostrophic effect) also decisively affect the development of a waterway. By and large, the influences aris ing from geographical location are expressed in the development of the te mperature gradient. In Sweden [far north], for example, the regular clim ate favours a positive or only weakly- developed negative temperature gradient. The flow of water in rivers is uni- form, as is the transport of sediment. The riverbed is perfectly regular, and in most cases trough-shaped (see fig. 17). Heavy water-masses only adjust slowly to climatic conditions of valle y floors, and water temperatures are preserved for a long period. Such conditions are also to be found in other mountain streams flowing through cool ravines or forests. Despite enor- mous fluctuations in th e amount of water discha rged and the generally steep gradients, moss attaches itself to the stones in such streams. The moment such a channe l is exposed to dir ect light, the covering layer of moss disappears from the stones, which subsequently will be dislodged, and breaches in the riverbank will occur: the channel immediately assumes the character of channels whose temp eratures fluctuate continuously. The earlier a watercourse is exposed to direct sunlight (through clear- felling and clearance), the faster the time and the shorter the distance in which the equalisation of temperature occurs. As a result, the water-masses decelerate abruptly in sharp brake-cu rves, and transported sediment is deposited prematurely (loss of energy a nd velocity with th e rapid transition from a positive to a negative temperatur e gradient). Very wide channel-beds are formed so that the water flowing through them under normal condi- tions is increasingly exposed to the effects of higher temperatures. The immediate result is excess ive evaporation and over-s aturation of the atmos- Fig. 17: Symmetrical trough-shaped channel profile"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"phere with water vapour, which promotes protracted rainfall or sudden cat- as trophic downpours with the onset of low temperatures. Venetian rivers enter the upper Italian plai n from a steep and almost sheer range of high mountains. Be cause of this they are s ubjected to ex traordinari- ly large and abrupt fluc tuations in the temperat ures of thei r immediate environment for the greater part of the year. As long as the river continues to flow in the mountains, the water and its surroundings are maintained at a uniformly low temperature. Fluctuations occur only within narrow limits The morphology of the riverbed exhibits no particular deviations. This all changes the moment the rive r enters the plain, which for the greater part of the year is warm, periodically hot, and is prone to s udden, strong fluctua- tions in temperature. Daytime and night-time temperatures also vary by up to 10°C (18°F). The profile of the str eam-flow takes on a very characteristic form; a very flat bed with deeply inci sed gutters (or even two or more gut- ters in very wide beds) - a pronou nced double-profi le (see fig. 18). As a rule the gutters in the torrente are very deep. However, since the stream-bed gradient is sl ight, the velocity of the water in the gutter keeps within normal bounds. Since forestry in the Italia n Alps is in a very poor state - whole areas are barren due to neglect over hundreds of years - when the snow melts, great quantities of cold water reach the hot plain without a transitional phase. The ensuing almost instantaneous reversal of the temper- ature gradient provokes the depositio n of large banks of boulder-gravel, which is ejected mechanically by th e massive volume of water in the stream-bed - and where the channel is insufficiently wide, this causes con- siderable flooding. Rivers in western parts of the upper Italian plain have a completely differ- ent appearance, although topographical conditions are the same as the Fig. 18: Channel with double profile"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Venetian. The rivers exhibit no torren te character, but fl ow in a regular pro- file at a uniform velocity towards the river Po. This regularity is caused by the large reservoirs of the upper Italia n lakes, which detain the snow melt- water and release it at a temperature already more suited to the plain, so that the formation of such extreme negative temperature gradients, which occur with the torrente, can no longer happen. In northward-flowing alpine streams, conditions are similar to those described above, but not as pr onounced as those of the torrente, because the northern slope of the Alps is gentler and fluctuations in temperature are smaller. Here, after leavi ng the mountains, the stre ams exhibit an asymmet- rical deepening of the chan nel with a build-up of sh allow gravel beds on the inside curve (likewise a do uble-profile) - also a resu lt of the negative tem- perature gradient present in the longit udinal and transverse sections for the greater part of the year (fig. 19). In the above, two extreme cases (Sweden and Italy) were discussed. Between them there is of course a wide range of intermediate stages which would take too long to el aborate here. It should be mentioned, however, that rivers which flow into the sea under a positive temperature gradient (those flowing into the Arctic Ocean) ca rry their sediment far out into the sea (promontory or haff formation), whereas rivers discharging into the sea under a negative temperat ure gradient deposit their sediment prior to reaching it (forma tion of deltas). In the case of a west->east direction of flow, the former rivers migrate lat- erally northwards due the constant en largement of the heavy water side and the migration of the stream-flow axis towards the northern bank. In the latter case the rivers are widened perpendicularly to the direction of flow in proportion to the decr ease in tractive force. Through the formation of the previous ly-described heavy water and light water sides, and as a result of helical inversion of the respective water-strata (see Temperature Gradient, Riverbed Slope and River Bend Formation on forma- tion of fords), centrifugal effects are induced. These are either strengthened Fig. 19: Channel with an asymmetrical profile"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"or weakened by the Earth's rotation (geostrophic effect) according to the direction (orientation) in which the discharge of water occurs. Channels flowing in an east->west direction have a different character to those whose flow is west->east, north->south or south->north. In a west->east channel the transport of sediment will be distri buted evenly over the whole cross- section, whereas in south- >north and north->south channels the transport of sediment is mostly one-sided. West->east and east->west channels will generally be fertile on both banks (although in the latter case both banks will eventually become barren). South- >north and north->so uth channels in the main are fertile on one side only and typically exhibit an asymmetrical deepening of the channel bed. The General Tasks of River Regulation In connection with the previous explan ations, the following factors are deci- sive in the formation of the channel cross-section, the development of the longitudinal profile and the hor izontal course of a river: • the topography; • the temperature gradient; • the geographical location; • the rotation of the Earth. The topography is dictated by Nature. Where it is esse ntial to protect objects of cultural value, it is possible to use minor retaining walls, although it would be wrong to attempt to regulate a river by means of its banks - in other words, merely to combat the effects, but not the causes themselves. In particular, bank-rectification in the form of straight, smooth walls is often dangerous, since the ensuing increase in velocity along the smooth walls will produce the circular motion described in Temperature Gradient, Riverbed Slope and River Bend Formation, fig. 16, promoting breaches in the riverbank in a downstream location. A more prom ising direction for river engineering is a priori to regulate the temperature gradie nt, for with the regulation of the temperature gradient with only minor s ubsequent assistance from the river- bank itself, the geographical constraints can to some extent be catered for. In the execution of river regulation works, the prime objective is the harm- less drainage of water, so th at human life and cultural assets will be protect- ed with all certainty from the effects of flooding. The foll owing factors must be taken into account in all river engineering: a): the longitudinal profil e and the horizontal course must be brought into harmony; "},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"b): the c hannel profile must be so consti t u t e d a s to enable the faultless dis- charge of a certain maximum quantity water in a manner suited to local conditions; c): precautions must be taken to ensure that water from cata strophic rainfall in the catchment area does not im mediately become surface run-off; d): endeavours must be made to regulat e the transport of sediment in such a manner that deposition or remova l only happens where desired. In connection with a); Over the cour se of time a bed-gradient will be established in a river, related not on ly to the mean annual discharge, but also to the temperature gradient corresponding to the mean annual temper- ature. This mean streambe d-gradient can then be maintained or engineered through the regulation of the temperatur e gradient appropriate to prevail- ing climatic (temperature) conditions . Furthermore, when modifying the longitudinal profile to suit the actual situ ation, care must be taken to ensure that the sequence of river bends is correct and that, for example, a left-hand bend does not occur where Natu re demands a right-hand one. Referring to b); th e channel profile must be adapted to the local condi- tions and must be capable of an or derly discharge duri ng periods of low and high water flow. The phrase 'suited to local conditions' will be used to mean: in those stretches of rivers which exhibit, and whose nature is favourable to, a natural positive temperat ure gradient for the greater part of the year, a simple trough-shaped prof ile would be appropriate. However, where strong fluctuations in temperature occur a profile should be selected which, due to its shape, contributes to the longest possible maintenance of low temperatures in the flowing water. A profil e possessing these character- istics is the type of double-profile which rigorously follows the prevailing conditions. In this a natural separa tion between heavy and light water occurs - therefore drainage of water will be orderly and lateral oscillations if the central axis of th e current will be reduced to a minimum, since this will be displaced from th e surface down to the deeper part of the channel. Through the distribution of weight vertically instead of laterally the flow of water at the bends is consistent with that of a healthy channel. It prevents change in temperature gradient within the cross-section, as was described in Temperature Gradient, Riverbed Slope and River Bend Formation, Heavy water flws in the lower part of the prof ile, local conditions permitting, and light water in the upper part. At the inte rface between the fa st-flowing heavy water and the slower-flowing light water, a train of vortices with horizontal- in-disposed axes is forme d, which acts counter to the direction of the cur- rent (fig. 20a). This train of vortic es distributes the suspended sediment openly to the right a nd left of the heavy water core (fig. 20b). The light water flowing above the heavy water protects it from excessive"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" Figs. 20a & 20b: Longitudinal and cross-sections of horizontal transversely disposed vortices in a channel direct heat. Through this the temperature gradient is maintained for as long as possible in the flowing water. The advancing cold-water core is braked mechanically due to the increasing velo city of the heavy water core, the vor- tex-train is enlarged and the cold water core diminished, automatically reducing its translatory energy. Conversel y, with a decrease in the riverbed gradient the translatory velocity slack ens, causing a reduction in the magni- tude of the vortex-train and its braking effect. The correct positioning of this vortex-train is extremely important. The mechanical formation of the transverse profile is dependent on it. In healthy waterways, apart from slight variations in river bends, the axis of the vor- tex-train lies horizontally, while u nder abnormal conditions it is sharply inclined or even vertical, giving rise to irregularly-shaped profiles. The appearance and power of such vortices at the interfaces between different velocities are described by Forchheimer: 51 Where a shallow strip borders on a deep bed, as is often the case where the flow overtops the riverbank, the unequal veloc ities create vortices with vertical axes. These vortices can excavate l ongitudinal gutters in the upper riverbed close to the edge of the deeper bed, which have the appearance of pipeline trenches. During the flood of 14th July 1913, a longish gutter 0.3m-1.5m (l-5ft) wide and 0.2m-1.5m (7in-5 ft) deep was formed in this way in the Leonardbach at Graz, by a vertical vortex about 30cm (12in) away fr om the edge of the deep bed (see fig. 21). 51 Hydraulik, 1914, page 499."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" Fig. 21: The formation of gutters in channels If it is impossible to implement a dou ble-profile (because of too high a cost, for example), then by means of a properl y-operated reservoir the discharge in the channel can be structured automatical ly in such a way that the temperature gradient becomes positive or only weakly negative along the stretch of river in question. In this case hea vy water always moves down the centre of the river and the even deposition of sediment and suspended solids on both sides acts to build up the riverbanks, as was mentioned ear lier in the case of the Tepl. In this instance the water carves out the appropria te profile unaided, and in the course of time a correctly-positioned double-prof ile (endowed with the previously described characteristics favourable to th e discharge of water) will come into being automatically, a process which naturally takes quite a long time. In connection with c); the essentia l measures for preventing rapid stormwater run-off have al ready been addressed in Temperature and the Movement of Water, so that any further comment here would be superfluous. Regarding d); the tractive force, the se diment transport of a river and their relation to the temperature gradient have already been covered during this discussion. Through the orderly intr oduction of the colder energy-water 52 present in affluent streams the positiv e temperature gradient and thus the tractive force can be maintained in the main channel - an objective which can also be achieved thr ough the after-release of lo w temperature bed-water from the dam. The intensity of the effect, however, will depend on the ratio of the after-flow water to the tractive-fo rce-deficient main -channel water. The temperature gradient at the conf luence of a secondary stream with a main stream must be properly establ ished, otherwise unw elcome phenomena may occur in the main stream in the sa me way that incorrect regulation of the secondary flow can also play the most appalling havoc in the main channel. 52 The German expression here is Energiewasser, Schauberger has also related elsewhere, that which could be interpreted as energised water when 1 litre (1 Kg) of good springwater at +4°C or water with higher dynamic energy, kinetic is drunk, it adds only 700-800 grams to the energy, vitality, energy-content or a combina- overall weight of the drinker, the remainder tion of all or any of these.

As was previously seen in the case of the torrente, when cold water-masses reach a warm valley fl oor, then the longitudinal profile shown below comes in to being. This is due to the tem- perature gradient which at this point has become negative. From A to B the temperature gradient is negative with a major accretion of sediment at B, the point where the tractive fo rce is weakest (see fig. 22). Here the water has attained its highes t temperature. Due to the back-up at B caused by the deposition of sediment , an overfall with potholes and a train of horizontally-disposed vortices (barrel vortices) is formed immedi- ately downstream from B, creating areas of low temperature (pockets of heavy water) which are clearly identif iable. When the light water passes over the top of this colder heavy wate r it will be cooled from below and the temperature gradient will become pos itive over the short stretch up to C and from here the whole process is repeated. For a regulation to be carried out succes sfully, the alternation of tempera- ture gradients must now be extended ove r a greater distance, resulting in a more regular movement of sediment a nd the re-formation of the stream-bed into gentler wave-forms. The Regulation of Temperature Gradient The establishment of the correct temper ature gradient is only possible under two conditions: • regulation of the temperature gradie nt through the construction of an impounded lake; • maintenance of the temperature gradient through the correct form of profile."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"On the first point: where topographical conditions permit and there are no problems with water rights, it is preferable to construct an impounded lake in the highest part of the river catchment area. With sufficient depth the lakewater becomes stratified according to its specific density, the lower-tem- perature water below and the higher-tem perature water above. At the point of out-take, the dam wall can be so co nstructed that water of the required temperature can be drawn from the re servoir through the automatic mixing of water of different temperatures taken from various levels. This is made possible by means of a movable sluice gate, activated automatically by a floating caisson directly exposed to the Sun's radiation and the external air temperature, and which will thus automatically release a greater or lesser cross-section of the deeper water-strata (see fig. 23). In this way bottom-water can be mixe d with surface water as circumstances demand. To this end, final adjustment of the floating caisson will be carried out after examination of climatic and other conditions, so that at all times the water leaves the dam at a temperature approx imating the prevailing air temperature. Taking this factor into account, the te mperature gradient in the sector of the channel decisive for regulation of the whole watercourse (usually the upper reaches) will become positive, with only a gradual and unavoidable transition to a negative temperature gradient. The point of transition and the progress of the change-over can thus be effected at th e desired location, which will be selected such that m echanical influences will produce no adverse effects. The reversal of the temperature gradient no longer takes place over short distances, but over a de sired longer stretch - and deposition of sediment will also no lo nger be precipitate, but w ill be distributed evenly along this greater length. Through the evening-out of the temperature gra- dient achieved in this way, only gentle modifications to the riverbed will occur instead of the haphazard disl ocation of the channel geometry described previously, an d conditions will be created which very closely approximate the mean annual temperature gradient and discharge. In connection with the second condition above: where impounded lakes cannot be built for some reason or other, attempts must be made to maintain a low water temperature for as long as possible - deci sive for a positive tem- perature gradient - throu gh the correct choice of channel profile. Such a pro- file was described under (b) above. The greatest attention must be paid to the horizontal development of the wate rcourse (sequence of river bends). For this reason the deeper part of the double-profile must be correctly posi- tioned in relation to depth and handing (left or right) at the river bend in order to maintain the central axis of the current and the proper alignment of the axes of the vortex-train. If the lowe r, decisive portion of the profile is properly established, then it also main tains its form and position in loose gravel, as is demonstrated by the gutters in the torrente."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" Fig. 23: Patented dam design to control the temperature of the discharge water.

Temperature surveys at various dams with inbuilt thermometers show that in concrete walls the temperature rises to about 22°C above the ambient temperature within a few weeks, du e to the generation of curing heat 54 . In many dams adjustment to the mean ambient temperature takes place more rapidly than in others (Jogne Dam - 1.5 years, Arrow Rock Dam - 5 years).

This p henomenon will now be examined with regard to its e ffect on the structure of the dam-wall, with the main emphasis on two aspects: 1): the cavitating, or sedimentating 55 action of water; 2): temperature-induced stre sses inside the dam-wall. Regarding 1): with a simultaneous d ecrease in temperature towards +4°C during flow (positive temperature gradient), water penetrating into the dam-wall loses its ability to dissolve salts and other substances, or to retain its already-dissolved or otherwise- transported matter in suspension. The tendency to deposit or precipitate these substances will be enhanced by the natural filtering action of the wall-structure, in whose pores the water deposits its dissolved salts as well as some of the accompanying suspended matter (sedimentating action of water). 56 Water increases its capacity to dissol ve matter and to maintain this in solution (the cavitating ac tion of water), if its te mperature diverges from +4°C in the direction of flow (negative temperature gradient) as it infiltrates into the dam-wall. Water flowing unde r a negative temperature gradient and isolated from light and air liberat es soluble acids from suffused sub- stances, resulting in a substantial increase in aggressivity and hence in its cavitating action. Before going further, the course of such internal tempera- tures should be studied using data from the Waldecker Dam 57 in which mea- Fig. 24: Cross-section through the Waldecker Dam"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"surements of temperature were carried out systematically. In this dam remote-controlled thermometers were installed i n two different cross-sec- lions about half way up the wall (T I - T V - see fig. 24). The thickness of the wall at the height of the thermomete rs is 15.3m (50ft). The results of measurement publishe d by Prof Thurnau extend over the period 1914-1918. These begin at the point where temp eratures arising from the curing process of the concrete have subsided, so that changes in external temperatures (air and water temperatures) were reflected inside the wall without distortion. In fig. 25b the course of the external (air) temperatures for the year 1917 are reproduced. In fig. 25a the progre ss of the internal wall temperatures determined by the thermometers I, II, III & V are shown. The temperature graph for thermometer IV was omitted, since its curve followed that of ther- mometer III almost exactly.

T V (temperature grapf of thermometer V) follows the curve of the external temperature with only a slight time-lag. T I , T III and T IV follow the profile of T V with a lag of about two months, whereas T II exhibits a phase-shift of about 4 months in relation to T V . In figs. 26a and 26b the temperature di stribution for various days of the year are indicated, from which it can be inferred that from 5th October 1916 the temperature gradient from W (water-side) to T II (water-side to ther- mometer II) is positive. In the mi ddle of December it leve ls out to zero and remains negative from then until about mid-July 1917 (greatest amplitude about 2nd May 1917), and then from here until about the middle of November 1917 it become s positive again. Over the section between T II and A (air-side) the reversed process occurs. From 5th October 1916 through to 2 nd May 1917, the temperature gradi- ent over this section is positive, and from here until the middle of October 1917 it becomes negative. It can be seen that the temperatur e gradient inside the wall fluctuates markedly, and that in one part of the year (under condi- tions of a negative te mperature gradient) a cavitating action of the water will set in, and in the other part of the year (under a positive temperature gradi- ent) a sedimentating action will be established. It therefore depends entirely on the conditions of locality, climate an d the orientation of the dam-wall, whether the former or the latter action of the water prevails. For example, in north-south oriented walls or in walls exposed to the ai r on the southern "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"side (east-west wall direction), the ca vitating activity (negative temperature gra- dient) will predom inate, as a result of more intensiv e or more sustained solar irradiation of the air-side of the wall, whereas when the air-side faces north (east-west wall direction) an equalisa tion of temperatures is also possible. A wall in which cavitation predominates will exhibit premature 'signs of old age', which manifest th emselves as cracks, incr eased seepage, and so on. In any event the life-span of such a wall will be significan tly shorter than a wall in which progressive consolidation is induced through the predomi- nance of sedimentation. This latter case can also be engineered under the most unfavourable local, climatic and site conditions if water is trickled over the full outer face of the dam- wall during the period in question. In this case it is important that the co lder bottom-water and not the surface water of the dam is used for the purposes of over-trickling (c ooling by trick- ling of water), roughly according to th e very schematic arrangement in fig. 27. With regard to this new type of dam-wall (over-trickling of mass-con- crete dam-walls), without going into more detailed explanations, even a lay- person can at least understand the purpose and proper arrangement of this over-trickling process, which is required fo r a few months only. The over-trickling has nothing whatever to do with the concept of the internal or external stability of the wall as normally cons trued today. Dams built according to this system will onl y be placed under water (as are all other walls) when the concrete has cure d sufficiently and the wall is stable. The aim of over-tric kling is to place a film of water between the external temperature and the air-side of the wall, in the process of which, due to evaporation of water, the wall on the air-side will exhibit lower tempera- tures than if the Sun we re to shine directly ont o its unprotected surface. Through the out-take of cold bottom- water by means of suitably arranged sluices and conduits, water-masses rema ining in the storage basin will auto- "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"matically be maintained at a higher temperature than the quantities of bot- tom-water channelled over the external face of the wall. The residual warmer dam-water, in accordance with natural principles, can now readily infiltrate into the unrendere d wall. The outcome of this proce dure is the cre- ation of a positive temperature gradie nt in the wall - the water passing through the wall ap proaches +4°C en route from the water-si de towards the air-side. As this water infiltrates an d becomes increasingly colder with fur- ther penetration, the molecules of th e wall contract. Becoming enlarged in this process, the wall-pore s (voids between the wall- molecules) will be tra- versed by the water in a positive direction (positive temperature gradient) and according to natural law it precipita tes its dissolved matter. Starting at the air-side, because of the lower temperatures on the external face, with progressive deposition towards the wate r-side the water blocks up the pores (sedimentation). If at the same time the wall-molecules are reduced to their smallest vol- ume, artificially-enlarge d voids are silted up th rough deposition. If as a result no pores exist in the wall (for all practical purposes), then the pres- ence of any water is also impossible. Signs of fatigue, stresses and tempera- tures which are mutually intensified by pressure and tension are now also no longer possible. The dam-wall is now immune to the effects of tempera- ture. We are here concerned with similar conditions that can still be found today in the structures of the ancient Egyptians - poreless stones that have remained unchanged for thousands of years, for there too all water and therefore every possibility for movement in the wall have been eliminated. In fig. 25b the brok en line indicates that over-trickling ought to have taken place from about mid-April to mid-Novemb er 1917. In this way the air-side of the wall can be insulated from temperatures above about 6°-7°C, and only minor fluctuations in the internal wall-temperatures can be achieved throughout the whole year, which will ap proximately follow those in fig. 26b. Over the greater part of the year the temperature gradient will be posi- tive and during the rema inder only very weakly negative. In this case greater fluctuations in temperature gradient, roughly akin to fig. 26a, are completely eliminated. Therefore the condition where the water's sedimen- tating action predominates can always be engineered artificially - and through this the progressive consolidation of the wall. The constant maintenance of a cool exterior wall-surface through over- trickling offers even further advantages: residual curing temperatures of the concrete can be eliminated in a relative ly short time. Variations in tempera- ture at the outer, air-side of the wall - often in excess of 40°C (104°F) during the year - will be prevented, hence averting the formation of surface hair- cracks, which foster the de structive action of frost. Regarding (2): As is commonly known, the action of frost on rocks and"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"wall-structures is based on the fact that the volume of water is least at +4 °C. With the onset of frost, the formation of ice (0°C) hence triggers off strong tensile stresses in surrounding rock, ow ing to the increase in volume associ- ated with 0°C water, whic h can lead to the fragmen tation of the rock itself. Changes in the volume of water under temperatures other than 0°C also play a role, however, when it is rememb ered that water's spacial coefficient of expansion is about 4.5 times greater than concrete. The effects of these changes in volume are not as obvious as those of ice, an d naturally take effect more weakly and ove r longer periods of time. In the following, a few observations on this aspect are worthy of note. If a body can expand freely , then its particles of ma ss as well as the pores between them increase in size. If the bo dy's free expansion is impeded, then in conjunction with the increase in volu me of individual particles of mass, a decrease in volume of pores also takes place. This latter cas e exists in dam- walls, since the particles of mass in the core of th e wall will be prevented from expanding freely due to the weight of the overlying sections of the wall (see fig. 28). In fig. 29 a series of mass-particles inside the wall are shown. For the time being it is to be assumed that the te mperature of the wall increases in the direction of flow (from the water-side to the air-side) - t 1 <t 2 <t 3 and t 4 <t 5 <t 6 (negative temperature gradient). The water-particles flow ing across horizon a-a therefore experience a rise in temperature from t 1 to t 3 over the distance d, wherein temperatures t 1 to t 3 are created through the reciprocal action between wall and water temperatures. An analogous process occurs at hori- zon b-b where generally speaking th e existing te mperatures t 4 to t 6 will dif-"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" for from those of horizon a-a, albeit mi nutely. This is because the processes of friction between the water and the wall in horizon b-b during flow will generally speaking be different from those in horizon a-a, due to the inho- mogeneity of the wall structure. The wall-particle m (see fig. 28), for example, is therefore affected by the various temperatures (t 1 , t 2 , t 4 , t 5 ) and its self-temperature t m will experience a small change d t m . However, if d t m is positive, then the particle will expand and, due to its position in the wall, will do so at the expense of the spacial volume of the pores. The wa ter present in the surrounding pores cannot flow away as fast, as this e xpansive movement occurs, and the water comes under pressure (the later flow of water from the water-side to the air- side becoming restricted owing to the increase in the volume of water-parti- cles associated with th e rise in temperature) 58 . If the same process occurs with a greater number of neighbouring wall- particles simultaneously, then to a certain extent the sum total of these events can eventually lead to tensile stresses in the wall. The constant repeti- tion and intensification of this process during the period of a negative tem- perature gradient can give rise to unw elcome stresses and si gns of fatigue in the wall-structure (for ex ample, in the above exam ple of the Waldecker Dam in the section T II to A: May-October). If on the other hand temperature decreases in the direction of flow (t 1 >t 2 >t 3 or t 4 >t 5 >t 6 - positive temperature gradient), then d t m will generally speaking be negative. The volume of wall-particle m, for example, will be reduced, and since the previously-descr ibed increase in volume occurred at 58 Even in cases where the water-body is able to greater than concrete. Pressures must become expand freely, with a rise in temperature the all the more intense when in the examined case pressure of the pore-water against the pore- the pore volumina do not increase in size with an walls is inevitable, since, as mentioned earlier, increase in temperature, but actually become the coefficient of expansion of water is 4.5 times smaller. - VS"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"the expense of the pore-volumina, the latter will become larger again Furthermore, because they are flowing under a positive temperature gradi- ent - their temperature is reducing - water-particles themselves assume a smaller volume. Thus with a positive temperature gradient the conditions are eliminated that could lead to stre ss-differentials in the wall-structure. Once again, the way to reduce the previ ously-described ha rmful, internal temperature-stresses to a minimum is to over-trickle the air- side of the wall in question, through which high extern al temperatures can be prevented from reaching the interior of the wall-structure. In this way large variations in temperature within a given cross-s ection (see fig. 26 a for example) can virtually be reduced to zero. As a result, the phenomenon clearly apparent in fig. 25a will also be avoided, since during the period of maximum (or minimum) external temperature, the in ternal temperature of the wall will nearly be at its minimum (or maximum). The extraordinarily favourable effect of over-trickling the air-side of the wall during the hotter pa rt of the year should well be evident from the above explanations, since it affects not only the consolidation of the wall through sedimentation, but also insulates it from larger variations in tem- perature. The increased co st of equipping a dam wi th an over-trickling sys- tem is minimal in relati on to the overall cost of construction, and is economic to the extent that it can actually offset the costs of waterproofing the dam-wall. 59 The possibility that over-trickling may entail unwanted losses of water is of minor importance since, firstly, su ch losses are only minimal, secondly, the efficacy and lifetime of the installa tion will be substantially increased, and finally, over-trickling is only necessary until such time as complete self- sealing of the wall through sedimenta tion has occurred. It should be noted that over-trickling is a one-off affair and is required only during the period in which consolidation of the wall pr oceeds. The duration of over-trickling should at most amount to six months. Premature removal of this curtain of water or its aeration is out of the que stion, since only very small quantities of water are involved and furthermore, over-trickling naturally will only be carried out when a sufficient su rplus of water is available. The type of out-take (see fig. 27) sugg ested by the author offers a further advantage: by mixing bottom and surface water, water of the appropriate temperature can be released as requir ed for the long-range further regula- tion of the downstream flow-regime. 60 59 Under certain circumstances, these watertight long period in the wall-structure and prevent membranes can actually bring about very the wall breathing. - VS unwelcome effects, in that they maintain 60 See \"Temperature and the Movement of Water\" and cement-curing temperatur es for an undesirably \"Fundamental Principles of River Regulation\". - Ed."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" The accompanying design for a dam on the Tepl above Karlsbad embodies features which are new compared with conventional methods of construc- tion. Their description form s the basis of the following report, which conse- quently concerns itself not with details, but exclusively with the new elements of the design. These consist in the erection of a subsidiary internal wall at a slight distance from the da m wall itself and between these two walls, water is allowed to rise from the bottom of the reservoir. Since the surface water of the reservoir is about 0°C in wi nter, the heaviest water of around +4°C collects at the bottom; the water temperature thus increases downwards, whereas in summer the opposite distribution of water takes place, namely, its temperature in creases from the bottom upwards. Water gains access to the inte rior of the wall via the hair-cracks present in all walls. The temperatures of the wall, the water and the air are constantly exposed to large and small fluctuations. The temperature of the infiltrated water always seeks to conform to the wall temperature with the result that its volume either increases or decreases. With an increase in volume, in the ma in the internal pore-water advances further and diffuses through the wall, ow ing to the pressure of water from the water-side. With a reduction in volume and assisted by the suction engendered by the decrease in volume, a further penetration of dam water occurs due to the continuing pressure of the impounded water. The eventual result of this oft-repeat ed process - the increase or decrease in the volume of the water present in the pores - is the impregnation of the whole wall with water. In particular the following process occurs: At the beginning of winter (Figures I & II- see fig. 30), with the onset of frost the water in conventional- ly constructed dam walls freezes to th e limit of frost penetration, expands and loosens the fabric of the wall. When warmer weather sets in - solar radi- ation - the ice melts to the depth of heat penetration, the water emerges from the air-side, taking particles of the wall with it. The danger thus arises that with subsequent freezing, further loosening of the structure will take place. The destructive action of frost w ould then increase constantly, since the pores will become larger and larger, substantially aggravating the explo- sive effect of frost. The way this new dam is designed enables water of about +4°C to over- Expert Opinion of Professor Philipp Forchheimer"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"flow the wall and also to enter the upper or the lower trough via the appro- priate diverter pipe. In this process t he ou ter wall surface will be protected from the pernicious, fl uctuating effects of the e xternal temperature. In summer it is necessary to differentiate between the behaviour during the day and during the night. In summer during the day (Figures III & IV) the water in conventionally constructed dams flushes out the cracks and enlarges the pores, which increases the ra te of percolation ov er the course of time and results in a further deteri oration in the condition of the wall. In the proposed method of construction, use is made of the bottom water, which even in summer is only about +4 °C initially and of a somewhat high- er temperature later on. This water is permitted to rise between the sub- sidiary and main walls and to flow over the top of the dam and down the external face. In this way the damaging action of water on the dam will be prevented. In summer at night (Figures V & VI), while the flushing of the pores will actually be diminished in conventional structures , it nevertheless still occurs. In contrast, with the new cons truction of the proposed design, no dissolution of the wall- particles takes place. In Case III, even with normal methods of construction and the usual out- flow of water via the sp illway, the discharge into the drainage channel can be influenced beneficially, because th e water cools as it flows downstream, i.e. its temperature redu ces from about 18°C to 14°C and hence increases in specific weight. After a sudden drop in temperature, which on occasion can happen in summer, this condition is inte nsified; the water flows away rapidly with no tendency to form bends. Its tractive force increases down- stream, carrying the sediment along with it and the channel bed is deep- ened. If water is released from the bo ttom sluice-gate, therefore at a deep level, then the difference between th e temperatures of the draining water (about 4°C) and the air (abou t 35°C) becomes very larg e. The vorticity of the water then becomes considerable and the formation of bends more frequent, resulting in the deposition of sediment on the inside curve and incipient breaches on the outside curve. With a ha lf-full reservoir, th ese events dimin- ish and the formation of vortices decreases. With Schauberger's system the water is discharged at a temperature of about +4°C and the aforementioned processes likewi se occur. However, with the aid of the diverter pipes it is possib le to select the temp erature of the dis- charge water and thereby adjust it to the prevailing air temperatures in such a way that turbulence and the undesira ble formation of bends is reduced. With regard to the confluence of the hot-spring with the Tepl, the follow- ing should be noted. Wherea s water of 10°C or 20°C has a specific weight of 0.9997 and 0.9982 respectively, the specific weight of 70°C wa ter is 0.9778; the hot-spring water is thus 0.022 or 0.020 lighter than the Tepl water."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Because of this t h i s mean bed-gradient of the Tepl diminishes due to the interaction between the diff erent specific weights of the Tepl-water and the hot-spring water and therefore part of the hot-spring water initially flows upstream instead of downstream. In contra st with conventional theories concerning flow-velocity, here it is reduced very considerably in the process, retarding the overall drainage of the water and resulting in a corresponding increase in height at time of flood. It should be mentioned in addition that when a substantial influx of water occurs, some of it is to be discharged directly into the Eg er through a fairly large diameter pipe, which branches off on the left-hand side of the reser- voir at a high level. This pipe will be rifled, since it has been shown that this produces a sharp increa se in flow-velocity. The Tepl flows into the Eger about 1.6 km downstream from the conflu- ence of the hot spring. At present, wher e the Tepl joins with the Eger, the Tepl water is warmer than the Eger wate r. As a result the Tepl enters here at a higher level and therefore no longer has any effect on the sediment, which is left lying on the bottom, damming up the Tepl itself. By constructing the dam and the rifled, high-level, overf low pipe according to Schauberger's design, the Tepl water will in the main be heavier than the Eger water and the accretion of sediment with its dammi ng effect on the Te pl will thus be reduced. This will exert a favourable ef fect on the danger of flooding from which Karlsbad presently suffers. From what has been stated above, th e superiority of th e Schauberger design over contemporary designs is apparent, a superiority particularly evident in relation to the extraordinary conditions at Karlsbad. In any case it is more appropriate to construct dams with adju stable conditions of discharge, whose stability increases with time, than to build dams with a fixe d system of dis- charge, whose structural stability consta ntly deteriorates, and all the more so, for through the po ssibility of regulati ng the condition s of discharge, the nec- essary storage area and the height of the dam can be reduced. In conclusion it should be mentione d that Mr Schauberger has already built several barrages (14), which have proved themselves. I have visited some of his constructions personally and I can state that Mr Schauberger's innovations have completely fulfilled their intended purpose.

River and stream engineering on the other hand encompass all works which enhance the use of flowing water for navigation, a nd which serve to protect the riverbank against flooding and rupture.\" The science of hydraulics further asserts: \"A stretch of river in a st ate of equilibrium provides the river engineer with the reference point from which to establish a normal profile in a tu rbulent stretch of river, and to bring about a stable condition. If the flow is confined within the appro- priate width (normal width), then it creates the normal profile itself, if it is given the means to achieve th is by a skilful hand.\" According to these definitions, and in the light of innumerable existing structures, completed experiments and expert opinions, one would be given to believe that the management of wa ter resources is nowadays very close to achieving its highest technical perfection. Every single drop of water would appear to be encompassed by mathematical formulae and therefore in cultivated areas there ought to be no waterway that could deviate by even a centimetre from its prescribed course. What are the actual facts? What is th e practical outcome of an already cen- turies-old brain-work in the domain of the Science of Hydraulics? Purely and simply, the sorry fact that in all areas of cultivation there is not even a single properly-regulated waterway in whic h a state of equilibrium has been achieved. Firstly, let us take the Dan ube whose regulation today has already swallowed up almost a m illion hectares of valuable farmland and enormous sums of money, and will swa llow even more - in spite of the fact that navi- "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"gation is just as fraught as before. To get some idea of the magnitude of this devastation, it should be pointed out that it the Danube \"were given the means by a skilful hand\" to form a normal profile itself, in these areas about 400,000 people could have found a carefree ex istence. With a deft flourish of the hand, enough land would be reclaime d in order to provide Austria's unemployed with adequate farmland. The same also applies to regulatory works on the Rhine, and th e fertile lowlands of It aly and southern France, where already hundreds of thousands of hect ares have equally fallen victim to completely misguided river regulation. Another very instructive example is provided by all our mountain rivers and streams [in Austria], which as wate rways are in an exceptionally ruinous state, consuming vast amounts of tax re venue annually. In spite of all this, instead of bringing about an improvemen t, they exhibit even worse degrada- tion than before, necessitating a constant increase in regulatory works. The reason why all these present systems of practical river engineering and regulation projects are on, and must pursue, the wrong course is that today no one knows what water is! Thales of Miletus (614 BC) described water, one of Aristotle's four ele- ments, as the only true element, from which all other bodie s are created. Not only were the Greeks on the right path towards appreciation of the true sig- nificance of water, but they also pr ovided us with information about the practices of long-vanished peoples, wh ose knowledge must have been con- siderably more advanced than theirs. Thus in his opus Timaeus and Critias, Plato relates that the inha bitants of erstwhile Atlan tis regulated their water- ways with the aid of cold and warm water. Only a complete understanding of the nature of water could have brought the Atlanteans to this method of river regulation - a science that sadly was already lost to the Greek sages, despite their intensive preoccupation with the me dium of water. Even Thales of Miletus overlooked the fact that the regeneration and further development of bodies with the aid of water is also a question of tempera- ture-associated processes. He failed to perceive the here decisive forces and energies which themselves are a produc t of the tensions arising from alter- nating phases of temperature. In order even to speak authoritativ ely of the efficien t management of water and a systematic build-up of cu ltivable land, it is first necessary to understand that water and properly-regulated phases of temperature are essential for all new formation, regeneration and further development. Furthermore, if humanity, ignorant of Nature's laws, sel ects the wrong ener- gy-form for the attainment of its goa ls, the energy-form s of water will become disorganised and the natural process of autonomous development will cease almost in stantaneously and will actually degenerate. Over the centuries humanity has ther efore inherited an incomplete and"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"false conception of the nature of water. Today, in our libraries and archives, we already have a vast amount of literature on water resour ces manage- ment - which bears silent testimony to a cultural ad vance that re grettably is only illusory. Until the most elementary principles co ncerning all evolution- ary processes of vegetation have been completely understood it is impossi- ble to speak of a real bu ild-up of culture. The deve lopment of any culture is directly related to the understanding of its environment - both water and vegetation. A brief review is necessary in order to understand what is to follow. Every new formation arises from the smallest first beginnings. Further develop- ment can only take place if circulation in the interior of the Earth proceeds correctly. In conformity with natural law, higher forms of vegetation build upon the preceding lower vegetation. This new growth is founded on sub- stances contained in earlier vegetation which have been transformed into carbones through the effects of temperature - and which now will once more be decomposed with the aid of water and higher temperatures. In this process of decomposition, water will also be decomposed, resulting in a new mixture of gases whic h liberate carbon-dioxide 61 as they stream upwards into the suffused and stirred-up salts. With the exclusion of air, this process not only creates entirely new conditions and compounds in the Earth's interior, but also uncovers a new and hitherto-unknown conformity with natural law in the mo vement of water, which is completely opposite to the presently recognised law governing its movement. The inner atmosphere of the Earth is created with the aid of water, car- bones and temperature - and with further adjustments of temperature it can also dissolve and transport salts. Throug h the deposition of these salts at the right time and place, the inner atmosphere is able to create a wide variety of new forms of vegetation and new bodies, such as ore and rock - but, natu- rally, always under the precondition that the i ndividual phases of temperature take place in the proper sequence. From this it is possible to perceive the definite coherence between the veg- etation that was formerly present and wh at is there today. On this basis the interrelationship between all mineral substances is also explained: how the substances are raised from the dept hs, transformed and refined through thermal processes which take place with the aid of water and its movement inside the Earth, following a hitherto-unknown natural law. The correct energy-form of water, necessary for growth, was described above, but just what is this energy-form? It is the particular form of water- 61 Since we are here concerned with subter- acid, because the German word used here, ranean chemistry, which takes place under the Kohlensaure, makes no distinction between car- absence of light, air and sometimes heat, what bon dioxide and carbonic acid. - Ed. is liberated in this cas e may actually be carbonic "},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"movement whic h, through the right mixture of Sun, Earth and water, results in a sequence of functions that lead to the refi nement of primary forms after proper decomposition of basic substances has taken place. From these new and higher forms of ve getation are built-up by the shortest and straightest route. In order to explain the functions of the movement of water, it is first necessary to examine the concept of motion itself. It is generally known that the motion of a pendulum consists of a constant alternation between energy-forms (kin etic and potential). The same phe- nomenon we also find in the case of el ectric oscillations which can only arise when two energy-forms, electrostatic (capacitative) and electromagnetic (inductive), interact. In the movement of water, one di fferentiates between laminar and turbulent forms of motion. Laminar motion is the stratified and unimpeded flow of water down an inclined plane. As long as the influence of temperature on the form of water movement is en tirely excluded, one can readily speak of laminar motion. However, as soon as temperature is taken into account, any laminar (stratified, ideal) motion is absolutely unthink- able. One can only imagine what such a movement of water would imply: it would mean nothing less than the a ccelerating descent of water according to the law of gravity, wh ich ultimately (at the lowest point on its path) would have to transfer to a motion less, almost rigid state of rest. This example shows us how extremes come into being, since a state of absolute rest would then occur as a direct result of water's constantly increasing velocity down the sloping surface - providing a clue to the researcher that he or she is here concer ned with a strict conformity with nat- ural law and an orderly sequence of fu nctional processes. Hence the steadi- ness in the flow of water-m asses down an inclined plane (gradient) is solely attributable to the influence of temperat ure. It thus follows that there can be no stratified, laminar movement of wa ter unless systems of water conduc- tion are specifically directed to this end. This movement corresponds to the kinetic aspect of the motion of a pendulu m. It is therefore now quite super- fluous to ask whether a second energy-fo rm of water movement exists, cor- responding to the potential component of pendular motion. Turbulent motion then, is viewed as the second form of water movement. Since temperature has so far been ex cluded as a principal factor, for the same reason it naturally could not be acknowledged as a contributing factor in the proper understanding of the cau ses of the so-called turbulence of water. To date turbulence has been s een as a vortical phenomenon, attribut- able to mechanical eff ects alone - through which various quantities of water of different temperatures are mixed mechanically. A more precise analysis reveals that turbulent phenomena in water are nothing less than the counter-motion to laminar flow - arisin g from physical causes and generat- ing vortical currents in flowing water, maintaining the steadiness of the "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"descending Mow through the creation of transverse currents. Inasmuch as laminar motion is the extreme condition of a real form of motion, the same can also be deemed to hold tr ue for the turbulen t motion of water. In reality we are concerned with two new forms of motion which lie between both extremes and are reciprocally related. In both cases each seeks to approach its extreme condition, but cannot reach it without the interven- tion of favourable or unfa vourable outside influences. For this reason exces- sively strong turbulence in water must lead to chaotic conditions which express themselves in larger and larg er cyclonic storms, catastrophic flood- rains and ultimately in continuous downpours over the same area, while conditions of absolute drought will occur in other parts of the world. It thus becomes clear that in practice we are concerned neither with laminar nor with turbulent energy-forms, but with two other energy-forms: the positive and the negative energy-forms of water. A po sitive energy -form (positive temperature gradient) is the internal movement of water temperature that occurs when temperatures of various water-strata approach +4°C, and is therefore a laminar form of motion. Conversely, the negative energy-form (negative temperature gradient) is the internal movement of temperatur e when the temperature of flowing water diverges from +4°C (39.2°F). Since a departure from this laminar zero or neutral point occurs when water graduates from +4°C towards 0°C (32°F), then the true zero-point of wate r is at +4°C, as di stinct from all other bodies which contract with cold and e xpand with an increase in heat. Water expands above and below +4°C - in both instances its volume increases and specific weight decreases. Co mpared to other bodies, th is results in an irreg- ularity, the anomalous expansion of wa ter - hitherto considered of minor consequence, yet playing a far great er role than was ever imagined. Hence we see that two influences are necessary for either energy-form: the Sun's influence on th e Earth and water, and the Earth's influence on water. Both forms of water movement, positive and negative (positive or negative temperature gradients), represent hitherto unknown magnitudes in the equation now to be solved - from which are derived not only the great fundamental laws of growth and synthe sis, but also the equally important laws of destruction that result in the degeneration of all forms of vegetation. The world is not subject to random accident but is governed according to inner laws, only through the forces of Na ture. Left to herself, Nature would have supplanted the earlier vegetation with newer forms, and not only would have transformed the world into a blossoming garden of immense fertility and stable temperature, but in addition would have renewed herself in cycles, as we shall see later. The opinion that Earth woul d have been covered with vast forests were it not for humanity's interven tion is undoubtedly unte nable. Here too, pre- "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"cisely because she would have been left to herself, Nature would not only have withhold the supply of nutrient salts from the vegetation at the appro- priate moment, but she would also have ensured that the refluence of sap occurred at the right time. As an exampl e of such self-regulation let us take the beech, when in high summer, due to the development of low tempera- tures from excessive evaporation in cr own foliage, an immediate reflux of sap can be observ ed. The otherwise unrestri cted further development would once again have been regulated automatically by an extremely sim- ple reversal of temperatur e (change in energy-form). For this reason optimum conditions, resemb ling Paradise, must have existed dur- ing periods when humanity was still unable to interfere. 62 Only thus can we explain how extraordinarily fertile soil once existe d in a large part of the north coast of Africa, where today wilderness and barren wa stes are on the increase. According to the testimony of ancient scribes, in Cart hage one could wander all day long in the shade of olive, pomegranate and almond tr ees. The Carthaginians were delighted to see their vines heavy with grape twice a year and their crops produce more than a 200-fold yield. In contrast to this lege ndary fertility, reports of the downfall of whole nations through colossal downpours and whirlwinds have also been handed down to us. Paradise and deluge are theref ore not to be deprecated as mere fable. These catastrophes and upheavals were initiated by humanity alone, and we are still causing them today. The purpose of the movement of water in plants, brought about by reversals in temperature, is to enable the uptake of nutritive material. The clear-felling methods of regeneration initiated by modern forestry must in any case lead to an inevitable and unwanted degeneration, and thus to the initial phases in the death of the high forest. The main reason for catastrophic d ecline throughout the forestry industry, which more than anything else has led to declining agriculture in upland areas, is none other than an involuntary reversal in the phases of temperature (temperature gradient) caused by the practice of clear-cut ting. This results in the cessation of the vital transportation of nutrient salts, wh ich then are inevitably deposited in the wrong places. Light-induced growth 63 is certainly no manifestation of increased growth. It is a fallacy for the detrimental enlargement of the trunk is caused not only by deposition in the wrong places, but also by the deposition of inferior matter, thus preparing the way for future dege nerative development. This unnatural growth results in the formation of sinuosities and even in the spiral-like configura- tion of water-supply vessels - which under normal conditions would lead to the for- mation of straight, plumb and extremely narrow ducts. Nature works uncommonly sl owly.

T herefore, even in river engineering, the causes of resu lting effects can only be observed in the field in Nature's great examples - in a watercourse from source to mouth. Once it has been determined how a waterway was decades ago and how it is today, records of it s continually-changing pattern of flow should firs t be made, and then and then only the causes of its destruc- tion should be sought. Observations over several decades are essential in order to understand the infinitely subtle, constantly-increasing potential in the interplay of forces, which even then is only perceptible through its mechanical effects. The causes, how ever, remain mostly unnoticed and overlooked, and are usually not taken into account. This explains why, up to now, we have only ever seen and striven to con- trol the effects themselves. Because of this, all that we have managed to do has been to aggravate the causes - whic h again leads to the manifold inten- sification of effects, ultimately pro voking catastrophes which legitimately happen according to natural laws. The pr esent critical condition of forestry and agriculture is a typical example of where ignorance and neglect of Nature's laws lead. Without a complete reversal in thinking and approach there can never be any hope of improvement. The spring that bubbles out of the ground in a healt hy forest under the shel- ter of healthily-grown and undisturbed mother trees has important tasks to perform on its way down into the valley. As it flows down, this water trans- ports nutrients which are de stined both for plants, an d for the internal consti- tution and development of animal life. The way in which these nutrients are distributed qualitatively a nd quantitatively proceeds ac cording to the laws of reaction, without which no li fe in Nature could exist. If one now considers the se nseless and reckless rape of water in countless wrongly-constructed hydro-electric pow er-stations, then we cannot even find words to describe the behaviour of the engineer who, in ignorance of the important function of water, thinks only in terms of its exploitability as a cheap source of power and does not c oncern himself with the extraordinary significance of water in Nature's house keeping. Moreover, he also fails to realise that with his wrongly designed machines he has destroyed Earth's pulse-beat a thousandfold. Water's kinetic energy and tractive force is decisively affected by the influence of the external temperature, which also alters water's consistency. The very instant that water comes in contact with the outside temperature, it absorbs oxygen, releas es carbonic acid gas (CO 2 ) and salts are precipitat- ed, which under certain circumstances may be most valuable.

The more intense the influence exerted by temperature, the more direct i t s action and the stronger th e effects become. Amongst other important conse- quences, such as a change in the direc tion of the energies, this results pri- marily in the deposition of suspended solids. In addition to the energetic principle operating here (t he laws of reaction), me chanical effects will not only be weakened or strengthened by physical causes, but conversely, phys- ical causes will also be strengthen ed or weakened through mechanical effects. Of prime importance is the observati on of water from so urce to mouth, taking particular note of the alterna ting temperature influences and the resulting energy-forms of the water. Water-resources management or river regulation should never be undertaken until it has been established what happens to a drop of water after it infiltrates into the ground and what hap- pens to it in the interim before it rise s from the Earth as a spring and flows down into the valley. [The aim of these few lines is to trace the naturally ordained functions that water has to perform along its way. It will thus become apparent on closer inspecti on that where water comes from and where it goes is of fu ndamental importa nce. During th e observation of these processes we will be able to establish indisputably that all the changes we encounter in the energy and functions of water are solely to be traced back to the hitherto discounte d effects of temperature. For this reason the hasty construction of any large hydro-electric power- stations is to be avoided for there are cheaper methods that produce better results.] When water evaporates from the sea, leaving all substances behind, the air becomes saturated with water vapour, creating a protective envelope against the direct rays of the Sun. Without this envelope the Earth would inevitably dry up and turn into a desert. Secondly, warming of the Earth's surface is possible only because of th e presence of water-vapour in the air. 64 Thirdly, this water-vaporous air is a precondition for a further development of energy (electricity). It should be noted that formidable climatic changes will occur if, as a result of incorrect systems of forest management and river regulation, the orderly formation of clouds is disturbed. Where these systems have been implemented, the number of thunderstorms has co nsistently decreased, while those that do occur ar e becoming more dangerous. 64 The high specific heat of water (lowest at permits long-term storage of heat. - Ed. +37.5°C) in normal temperature-ranges for life "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Following from this, the functions of water i n the air become clearly apparent. As long as the preoccupati on is to conduct wa ter by the fastest and shortest route to the sea, less and less water will infiltrate the ground. This will cause the Earth to cool off, the supply of nutrients to decrease 65 and the development of vegetation and life on Earth to undergo a radical change. If water is to fulfil its task and if the danger of catastrophes is to be averted, it is essential that water is not drained off arbitrarily, but only in a manner suited to its purpose - so that it can carry out its appointed func- tions according to the laws of Nature , unimpeded. These important process- es occur through a truly remarkable in teraction between conformities with natural law. All these would be dest royed were water to be channelled according to the dictates of humanity, with its supposed laws and mathemat- ical formulae. The movement of water over an incl ined plane (gradient) takes place under a more or less unstable state of equilibrium, which depends on the correct proportion between water-quantity, gradient and temperature. If con- sideration is given only to the quantity of water and the gradient, which can be calculated mathematically, the inner energetic processes actually taking place here will never be understood nor influenced in the right way. Neglect of the part played by temperature leads to the destruction of the waterways. It is now very hard to find a place to observe water under the conditions that existed before humanity interfered. Let us now observe a he althy spring bubbli ng up under healthy forest conditions. The spring emerges into th e outside world with a low water temperature and in deep shade. As it emerges there are found light depositions of matter. In these depos its is a profusion of small creatures which crawl about at the bottom of the spring pool and live off these sub- stances. Characteristically, water flowing from healthy springs, which are only to be found in healthy high-quality forests, does not attack the riverbed or the banks, even on the steepest of gradients and despite the often heavy and uneven flow 66 . In such clear, cold spring waters, bodies (stones etc) lying on the bot- tom are covered with moss and other aquatic plants. Astonishingly, when closely observed, these delicate young shoo ts hardly move, in spite of the torrential force of water rushing past above them. Careful study reveals that the direction in which these young shoots point changes with a change in 65 Under the exclusion of light and air, deposi- phere, which affects and regulates climatic tem- tion of nutrient salts occurs with cooling. peratures. - Ed.

At very particular temperatures the tips of these plants and mosses stand at right angles to the direction of the current. All these observations can only be made in water with healthy tempera- tures. If such waters are suddenly se t out in the open, where clear-felling has been done along the riverbank, this state of well-bal anced harmony dis- appears almost instantaneously. As a result, the watercourse changes colour and character, tears at its bed and banks, loosens sediment, and in areas prone to torrential flows degenerates into a torrent. Whatever measures are undertaken to avert the dangers associat ed with such chan nels in the event of elemental disturbances is described as 'torrent confinement'. In reality, however, these merely endow it with even greater dimensions and inaugu- rate new perils. The same applies to river and stream regulation. We referred earlier to the regulatory works on the lower Danube, where today 950,000 hectares have been transformed into a flood plain - which have thus become useless as agricultural land. In the Neue Freie Presse (New Free Press) Professor Vidrasku wrote: \"Unfortunately, in the belief that construction of huge dams on the banks of the Danube would suffice, works were begun without having studied the problem in sufficient detail\". He continues: \"If we were to eliminate flooding with massive, high dams, and no longer perm it inundation of the flood plain, then the floodwater would rise so high that al l our river-ports and all riparian settle- ments along the Danube would be under wate r. Moreover, river and lake naviga- tion, which even today is unsatisfactory, would be significantly impaired, and the dams themselves would offer no additional security.\" Another excellent and informative exam ple of intolerable artificially-cre- ated conditions is the raising of the Rh ine bed at Salez. The cross-section of the valley shows that the Rhine flows along an elevated strip of land, its bed lying up to 4m (13ft) above the lowest level of the valley, and its 1890 flood- water peak 7-8m (23-26ft) above the lo west point of the valley, ultimately intersecting the rooftops of the villages in the lowlands. With good reason Mr Otto Rappolt, a chief government surveyor, states in his book River Engineering (Flussbau - Goschen Sammlung) that: \"The deforestation of the catchment area and the system of river realigment is to be considered the principal cause of this hazardous predicament.

If traditional systems of torrent- confinement, river and stream regul ation, and contemporary methods of hydroelectric powerstation construction c ontinue to be used, the causes of the increasingly fre quent catastrophes will never be eliminated. On the con- trary, these incidents will assume even greater magnitude from year to year. The havoc caused by the destruction of our high forest has without doubt already tipped the scales. The Natural Movement of Water over the Earth's Surface (The Atmospheric Cycle) and its Relati on to River Engineering (Part 2) [An article by Viktor Schauberger published in Die Wasserwirtschaft, the Austrian Journal of Hydrology, Vol. 10.1931, pp. 148-153.] In the sheltered environment of forest a waterway can maintain its steady temperature to a certain extent. The ex ternal temperature exerts only just sufficient influence - indirectly, through the triggering of we ak vortical phe- nomena - as is necessary for progressive reduction in tractive force. Healthy forest, or cold affluent streams that join the main body of water along its course, ensure that absorption of heat proceeds slowly, providing a basis for an even release of nutrients for the be nefit of flora and fauna in its immedi- ate surroundings. (The Amazon river in Brazil and the rivers of Java, for example.) Without healthy forest there is also no healthy water, no healthy blood and therefore a deterioration in the most fundamental conditions for life, all of which result from the present methods of water and forest- resources management. The longer water is shielded from th e direct light of the Sun (through for- est protection, proper arrangement of la kes and cooling affluent streams), the longer it will retain its energy and above all its tractive force, and the more regular the release of its substances, its overal l flow-characteristics and direction. Properly managed water - that is, water with a temperature adjusted to prevailing climatic conditi ons - cannot attack riverbanks, as will "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"be shown later. Incorrectly handled water whose temperatures are generally too high, has the capacity to tear into riverbanks, and for this reason assumes the characteristic behaviour of a torrent. It must be emphasised here that all attempts to maintain the equilibr ium of a watercourse by means of the riverbank itself, in the form of bank rectification, are futile. The best proof of this fact ar e all the regulatory works carried out in accordance with this principle, which, despite the ongoing need for repairs and mainte- nance, continually give rise to new damage and further expense. Naturally, the distribution of wate r-masses according to their various states of aggregation is of special importance. Premature evaporation of water-masses (due to warm soils) du ring drainage over the ground surface results in disproportionate accumulations of water vapour in the atmos- phere. Because of this, a reversal in th e reciprocal interaction between tem- perature gradients occurs too rapidly in the atmosphere, which again must lead to heavy rainfall an d cyclonic storms. The ensu ing reciprocal effects of ground-temperature produce undesirable te mperature gradients in draining water-masses, through which the full hydrol ogical cycle of water is further adversely affected. In such instance s, instead of infiltrating the ground, water flows into ever-broader channels. As a result of excessively high tem- peratures thus arising, wa ter transfers into the atmosphere too rapidly. Because of this, not only is the vi tal extraction and supply of nutrients arrested, but in th is way even greater and more catastrophic floods must also follow. If we now apply the above concepts of temperature gradient, we are pre- sented with a case where a blocking tr ansverse current flow is created due to an over-strong outside influence, resulting in the widening of the channel through too rapid a departure from +4°C (thermal expansion of water). In such a case we can also speak of an excessive negative temperature gradi- ent, which must lead to a loss of th e draining water's state of equilibrium, and to heavy, flow-dislocating accumula tions of sediment. More and more the draining water approximates the tu rbulent second energy-form, entirely loses its inner equilibrium through increasingly stronger counter-move- ments and eventually begins to scou r the channel bed, creating pot-holes and washed-out depressions in order to brake its descent. The channels become wider and flatter, the influence of exte rnal temperature more intense, and in the process, larger and larger volumes of water are returned to the atmosphere. The apparent disapp earance of the water, the constant increase in dried up channels and in catastrophic storms are the legitimate consequences, rightly attributable to ri ver regulation projects as carried out today. From the following results of observation it will become clearly apparent that current systems of water manageme nt must gradually lead toward total "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"elimination of all s pecies of vegetation, hence all forma of agriculture. The economic decline taking place before our very eyes is but a first step down this road, which only a re turn to Nature may yet pe rhaps be able to arrest. Frightening examples of the result of such treatment of water are deserts, which often were once the abode of hi gher cultures. Excavations bear wit- ness to the efforts that were made to preserve the dw indling supply of water through large-scale hydraulic installations of all descriptions, which regrettably were poorly designed. Indee d, we have but to glance at a map of the Gobi desert, whose rivers dry up around the edges of this ever-widen- ing wasteland. Thoughtless treatment of vegetation and excessive influence of the exter- nal temperature at these latitudes have created the present pattern of the deserts. Once the reasons for the present destructive phenomena and how they were caused are fully understood, new places to live can be wrested from the deserts by reversing this gradual decline - by rearranging the ener- gy-forms in question - and new possibilities for life can be created by start- ing again just as gradually from the very first beginnings. To date the concept of temperature has not been evaluated at all. Water flowing down a gradient is governed by two different influences: the direct influence of solar radiation and the i ndirect influence of the Earth's moist bulk. Both these influences maintain the unstable state of equilibrium in draining water through changes in the en ergy-forms, which in turn modify the gradient. Quite obviously the Sun's influence must be greater than the Earth's, and this more potent influence will primarily be brought to bear on the upper margins of the ch annel body. At this locatio n, due to the influence from outside, water will exceed its critical velocity and become more strongly turbulent. If the outside in fluence is indirect - for ex ample, due to the shelter of the forest - then it exerts an effect on both sides more or less uniformly, as long as both banks are similarly constituted. If the outside influence acts directly (direct solar radi ation), then it gives rise to an irregul ar, non-uni- form development (diurnal fluctuations). This greater effect of temperature results in the formation of sharpe r or gentler bends in the river. In a manner of speaking, accretions, incipient breaches and other symp- toms of flow-dislocation are to be vi ewed as places selected by prevailing disturbances for the deposition of matter. Once again, particular attention is drawn to the fact th at deposition occurs in the interior of the Earth (with the exclusion of air) as the temperature approaches +4°C, whereas on the surface of the Earth (under the influence of air) this deposition takes place as the tem- perature moves away from +4°C. Apart from this important physical out side influence, consideration must also be given to the influence of fric tional heat (mechanical effect). Cold, healthy mountain water flowing rapidl y over the riverbed and along the"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"walls and edges of the riverbank generates slight eddies and hence counter- currents at the above contact surfaces. This is as a result of localised exceed- ing of critical velocity relative to water temperature, induced by frictional heat. The prerequisite for such a counter-current is a difference between the influences of the ou tside temperature and that of the ground. 68 The lower the temperature of the cent ral mass of core-water, the greater the relative rate of flow. In the same relativ e proportion this now triggers off a reaction on the riverbed and banks through mechanical and physical impulses in the form of counter-curren ts. If the proper proportions between temperature, mass and riverbed gradient should now exist, then the precon- ditions for the unstable state of equi librium of the water-masses would be met. This state, however, is virtually impossible. If the riverbed gradient is too slight for the prevaili ng water temperatures, then removal occurs - or in the opposite case, accretion. The riverbed gradient therefore adjusts itself according to the temperature gradient, whose constancy will again remain undisturbed as long as protecting forest continues to exist in its proper mea- sure and composition (presence of cold affluent streams). The preservation of the watercourse is thus exclusively dependent on the proper conservation of the forest, and the necessity to regulate waterways today is therefore a consequence of unnatural forest ma nagement. Should it now be contended that the forest would in any case have to be cleared for agriculture, then it is to be countered th at this is quite in order up to a cer- tain extent, on condition that suitable substitutes (properly constructed reservoirs and river profiles) can be provided in lieu of forest. In the absence of forest these substitutes must be ca pable of constantly maintaining the essential stable state of river equilibrium. Under such preconditions, the previously-described phenomena observed in the behaviour of aquatic plants will also be reproduced. If these plants should now incline up- or do wn-stream, then it is mere ly the effect of slight fluctuations and rearrangements of the temperature gradient. If the tips of mosses stand motionless and perpendicula r to the direction of the current, like a needle on the scales pointing to wards zero, then in this way they affirm the existence of the proper co nditions for equilibrium. The formation of minor eddies (counter-currents) described above continues to take place in the proper measure for as long as the correct conditions of temperature prevail in the main body of water. If, after the removal of forest, the water is exposed to the di rect light of the 68 It could be construed from this that if water, the increase in flow-velocity then, natural riverbank and air temperatures are equal, then obstacles apart, turbulence due to the exceeding the tendency for the formation of such counter- of critical velocity relative to water-temperature currents would diminish. Thus, if the riverb ank would be reduced to a minimum. - Ed. and air temperatures were to cool in step with "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Sun, then along the upper contact-surfaces of the riverbank strong vortical currents (turbulence) develop. The central core water-masses forge ahead and exced their critical velocity. The gurgling up of turbulence in these core water-masses at the positio n of the greatest velocity is an after-effect whose original cause has so far not been clar ified. In a manner of speaking it is the emergency brake against over-rapid draina ge of water-mass es down a gra- dient, and the hitherto unexplained maintenance of the steadiness in the flow of water down an in clined plane (gradient). All of a sudden a reaction sets in, in the form of a sharp counter-motion. In this braking curve the whole body of water will be pulled around hard to the left or to the right. Pot-holes in the riverbed develop because the run- away water is braked too severely and too abruptly, subsequently leading to familiar destruction of the riverbed and ba nks. Instead of being alleviated or arrested, these phenomena will only be made far worse through contempo- rary preventive measures. It should be mentioned here, for example, that avalanches are also created in a simila r fashion, and in the process of com- bating their ravages, as is the case w ith water, mechanical effects alone are perceived - and with no consideration gi ven to the physical causes, attempts are made merely to redress the mechanical effects themselves. A further function of the formation of vortices, which evolve through mechanical and physical processes, is to enable aeration of water-masses, adjustment of water temperature and modification of kinetic energy - as a direct result of which banks and rive rbed will also be re-modelled at the same time. The riverbed gradient is therefore a secondary effect of the temperature gradient. The transverse, blocking disposition of the water-ma sses, the widening of the channel, the external influences wh ich thereby exert a more direct effect on the one hand, and the even tual evaporation of water en route (drying up of rivers), the creation of deserts and unparalleled floods on the other, are the all-too-familiar outcom es of manipulation of wa ter according to current theories. This end-result, however, is the entirely legitimate and proper con- sequence of contemporary systems of water resources management. Disasters and devastation must therefor e increase automatically in precisely the same ratio that capital is sacrificed for river engineering projects carried out according to conventional practice. In the above, the influences affecting water have been described in broad outline. In the following it will now be shown in greater detail just how dependent aquatic creature s are on water, and how they have to pay the penalty for every man-made mistake. In healthy water immediately below a spring, we find the healthy moun- tain trout, famous for its tastiness. U nder the careful scrutiny of a watchful observer, this stationary trout, whic h enjoys a comforta ble and peaceable"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"existence in healthy water conditions, is reminiscent of the gentle swaying movement of the previously-described moss-tips . To those who know how to observe, this now offers a plethora of fascinating insights. They learn to understand the purposefulness of the trout 's very slightest movement and begin to realise that both in theory and practice the human mind consistent- ly has the perverse inclination to take the wrong road, although Nature con- stantly demonstrates the right way with countless reiterations and allusions. With the exception of the spawning peri od, feeding is the sole reason for every movement. Slight changes in the height or depth of station neutralise the variations in the movement of the food supply, occasioned by outside influence. If the trout is frightened, then it bolts upstream like a streak of lightning, only to return once more to its former position af ter a certain peri- od of time. With a very simple procedure it can be established that, as a rule, a trout positions itself in the axis of core wate r-strata at the place where water parti- cles closest to +4°C flow , which are therefore least turbulent. Water particles moving along this axis poss ess the relatively highest velocity, due to orderly (more laminar) forward motion. All fo reign bodies heavier than water, including the trout's food, also travel along this energy-line, which is the true axis of a river. It is also here that turbulence and eddies created by the trout's own body are best able to assi st its own motion. As long as healthy conditions prevail - as long as the core water-masses remain in proper rela- tion to bed-gradient and river bends - vortical phenomena will continue to appear, which are more intense at the upper margins of the riverbank and which become increasingly weaker the further down they occur. Under such conditions the position of the current axis ha rdly varies at all. The minor vortices running counter to the current-flow at the edges carve out small hollows and cavities as the channel necessar ily widens and flattens out. In the process they dislodge bits of soil from both banks, and with them food for fish (worms which prefer to live in the cool, damp edges of the riverbank). The constant increase in the strength of outside influence, due to the widening of the channel, ensures the progressive reduction of water's tractive force, and with it the even deposition of sa lts, which are anyhow of increasingly lower grade. 69 Towards evening the temp erature gradient once again approaches a positiv e energy-form and in the night the transport of sediment takes place. Similarly, higher quality water also arrives in the lower reaches during the night (less deposition - greater sediment transport - deep- er bed). At an appropriate temperat ure the watercourse regulates itself entirely. Noticeable bed-load movement, sediment accretions or breaches of the riverbank are unknown phe nomena in hea lthy waterways. 69 The higher the water temperature, the more in ferior the quality of dissolved salts. - Ed."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"In waterways with the correct conditions of water temperature, the chan- nel will not only widen itself in the right proportions but will also deepen itself in the lower reaches. Therefore it automatically develops l ongitudinal profiles suited to the vary ing shape of the river cros s-section - to the extent necessary for the removal of bed-load, which under orderly forest condi- tions is in any case minimal. If flooding occurs in watercourses still undisturbed by human hand, then the influence from below becomes more intense as the volume of water increases, due to external temperatures - which as a rule are low at such times. As it also does at night, the te mperature gradient approaches the pos- itive energy-form, and because of lo wer temperatures, the water-masses flow faster without overflowing the ba nks or attacking them. The tempera- ture gradient is primary in function and the riverbed-gradient becomes sec- ondary if, as a result of proper r earrangement of temperature, the mass-transport of sediment is regulated in accordance with the correspond- ing increase in velocity. Were the channel not to flatten out (as in fords), then a reduction in trac- tive force would also not occur. The release of nutritive matter would also not take place, owing to low temperatures which remain constant in deep waters. 70 In properly managed water conditions - or more accurately, in untouched waterways protected by natura l, undisturbed forest - the correct channel profile will be formed. This will also lead to an increase in the vol- ume of water in the lower reaches, and with such an increase in mass, the corresponding influence will also develop from below, from the Earth, resulting in a weakening of the stronger influence from above (the Sun). Because of this, it will not only be almo st impossible for sedi ment to be left lying on the bottom, but it will also be almost impossible for flooding to occur in the lower reaches. The greater the volume of water, the greater too the rate of flow under otherwise-identical conditions (e.g. gr adient), as a result of the correct rearrangement of temperature. With th e establishment of a correct profile, the temperature gradient automatically activates the energies required for the transport of such large volumes of water. The bu ild-up of energy required for sediment transport in the lower reaches takes place through the confluence of lower-temperature affl uent streams with the main channel. With current methods of river regula tion, the outside influence inevitably becomes more and more direct an d therefore increasingly apparent.

The critical velocity of the core water-masses will be exceeded on a larger scale through constant repetition. Owing to the fo r - mation of pot-holes and striations the current axis will become increasingly ill-defined, the watercourse ever wi der and the deposition of sediment greater. Even the trout will only be able to obtain its food by changing its position more and more frequently, since this no longer travels as centrally as before. Here too, in the same way as for humanity, hard labour for its daily bread begins for the fish. With this further development, an increasingly futile struggle begins for its very existence. Even for the otherwise peaceable trout, this untoward event initiates a ba ttle for the survival of the fittest, affording an existence to several speci es of predator whose life-expectancy at this stage is also very limited, since the watercourse and the water in it are already diseased and in the process of drying up. If one observes micro-organisms that evolve in the water just below a spring under the influence of light and the Sun (hea t), then it also becomes clear why fish seek out certain spots at the head-waters of a stream at spawning time. It is becoming harder and harder for mother-fish to find a suitable place to lay their eggs, and wh ere young-fry, left to fend for them- selves, will have a chance to begin th eir lives. The decline in the former abundance of fish is mainly attributable to the increasing scarcity of healthy water, which instead of gushing forth from noble, high-grade springs, laden with nutrients and trace-elements, trickles out of the Earth in empty seepage springs. Already unhealthy at the spring itself, such water is unable to gen- erate healthy drainage conditions downstream. The core water-masses no longer surge ahead momentarily, and in stead of a convergent (centripetal) movement of water-particles, the whol e central body of water becomes tur- bulent. Its energies are directed toward s the banks because of accretions of river-gravel and sediment, resulting in breaches in the riverbank and the formation of islands. At this point attention should be dr awn to a major misconception. This forward surge has so far been viewed as a process of continuous accelera- tion. In reality, this supposed accelera tion is precisely the precondition for its inner braking, through the incidence of increased turbulence where the flow-velocity is greatest. Consequently, all mathematical calculations hither- to applied to this phenomenon must undoubtedly lead to exactly the oppo- site effect (a reaction effect). Eventually a bend in a river is not only formed horizontally, but also the water actually begins to curl in upon itself. Over-heated surface-water becomes turbulent and trails behind the deeper, colder water-strata, which continue to surge ahead, altering their consistency and eventually falling back themselves.

As long as healthy water conditions pr evail, a trout enjoys great abun- dance and a wealth of choi ce. In cold, clear water, the stationary trout easily espies every morsel of food floating towa rds it, alters course with a flick of i t s fins - and with an expert eye evades the angler's hook. The small fish are the main ones that bite, because they swim outside the mainstream of the current and hungrily seize upon every scra p of food that deviates from its regular path. If sultry weather conditions occur, and if temperatures rise in a sharp curve (negative temperature gradient), then the whole body of core- water becomes turbulent. Now becomi ng hungry, the stationary trout ner- vously darts about, lunging at gnats dancing above the surface and becomes careless. It falls easy prey to the a ngler, who is well aware that in such weather the large trout bi te - but ha s no idea why. The same naturally applies after a fall of rain, when newl y-arrived water nece ssarily mixes with riverwater, which becomes strongly tur bulent in the process - chaotic flow conditions arise, which make all orderl y supply of food impossible, and the trout becomes ravenous. The principle governing the movement of fish in water or birds in the air is the same, although there are obvious st ructural differences attributable to different properties of the respective media. In its own way, each medium can be influenced by way of reacti on phenomena in order to produce the desired effect - the most efficient forw ard motion. Like the fish, the bird has the ability either to overcome resistan ces peculiar to the medium through physical (not mechanical) processes - and without any majo r expenditure of energy, or at least minimal expenditure at the right moment. What has hith- erto been held to be impossible - a la rge output with a minimal input - will be restored to the realm of fact, shaking the very fo undations of current the- ory concerning energy and its conservation. The various resistances and the friction which, following natural law, increase by the square of the starting velocity, will be neutralised in the same ratio by the physical factors mentione d above. Consequently, by exploiting this new factor at the right moment, a ll that will remain to be overcome in practice is the resistance-l ess medium. Once again, th e most detailed analy- sis of the energy-forms here in questi on is necessary in order to replicate this ideal motion artificially in either medium to suit our purposes. While it is quite remarkable that trout can move so rapidly upstream, in view of its relatively modest energies, at first view it is equally baffling that the trout is able to remain motionless without any appreciable effort in fast- flowing waters in which a human bei ng can barely stand up. In clear, cold,"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"healthy mountain water, a stationary trout positions itself in the central axiw of the current, where the water-f ilaments flow that most closely approxi- mate +4°C. The trout influe nces the velocity of wa ter flowing past it w i t h the smooth, slippery surface of its skin - at first with a purely mechanical energy-form. Displaced by the mass of the trout's body, the water initially comes under pressure and slips past th e slimy body with a greater velocity than water particles further removed from it. The immediate effect is that the highest flow-velocity possible under the prevailin g water temperature is exceeded, producing an increase in turbulence. In the neutral zone created in this way by the counter-flow of the wa ter, the trout is able to stand still without effort (see fig. 31). If the water becomes too wa rm as a result of external influences, then the reaction will also be weaker. In part icular motion and counter-motion will be thrown out of balance, and the tr out will be pushed gently downstream. Conversely, if the temperature su ddenly drops, it will be propelled upstream. The trout also quickly vacate s places where chan ges in the unsta- ble state of equilibrium are most ex treme and seeks out a new position suit- ed to the changed conditio ns, so as to re-estab lish the lively balance between water, reaction (counter-move ment) and body-form. The establish- ment of the state of equilibrium outlined above evolves purely and simply by mechanical means alone, due to an increase in turbulence. By breathing through its gill s and therefore by means of purely physical impulses, a trout is able to neutralise, not only the effects of rapid movement of water, but also smaller irregularit ies. The effects triggered off are much "},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"larger than the trout's relatively minor applications of force, and because of this they can be raised to an unusually high level of efficiency. A trout is forced backwards by flowing water the moment gill-breathing ceases. When the trout swims rapidly upstream, then it breathes with greater intensity and rapidity and, in a manner of speaking, when it takes to its heels, its gills operate at full throttle. These processes are explained as fo llows: the formation of counter-vor- tices described above provide the trout with its raw condition of equilibri- um. They evolve mechanically and are suited to the size of the body and form of movement. The inst ability of the state of e quilibrium, ho wever, cre- ates the possibility of increasing the velocity of the water by physical fac- tors, through which increa sed turbulence is caused by pressure from the gills. Breathing through the gills not onl y serves for the intake of oxygen, but also for forward motion - an arrangement which illustrates Nature's absolute superiority. The trout increases the velocity of water through deep and rapid breathing, to the extent necessary to conduct a correspondingly- larger volume of water (from which oxy gen has been removed) through the gills and alongside the body . In this way, vortices that have been intensified in a potential sense can now be generated in almost any desired form and strength, as counter-movements. In this fashion counter-currents originally evolving through the mechanical forma tion of vortices will be multiplied and the trout needs only to redeploy its tail-fins in order to exploit the reac- tive effects. The end-result is accelera tion of the body in the opposite direc- tion to the draining water. In the in terval between breaths, mechanical vortices alone are active. The gentle tw isting movements of the fins destroy the vortices created mechanically (d estruction of vortices by formation of vortices) and the trout moves backwards. With the very first expulsion of breath the trout again stands still in the most torrential of flows. The secret lies solely in the exploi tation of hitherto-unknown laws of water movement. Therefore, it will no longer sound st range when the asser- tion is now made, that not only are today's hydroelectric turbines both uneco- nomic and unreliable, but ships and aeroplanes are as well, since they operate contrary to laws prevailing in their respective medium of air or water. One of the most immediate practical app lications, achieved by influencing the medium artificially but acco rding to natural la w, will provide pr oof that it is possible to cause any propeller-drive n aeroplane to nose-dive from any desired height. The air-pockets and verti cal wind-shear so feared in aviation which force aircraft into a vertical dive, are none other than the interaction between temperature gradients - which as a rule regularly reverse early in the morning or towards ev ening. Inasmuch as air-cr ashes can be traced back to these causes, the majority always o ccur at such times. The time of year also plays a major role. These inversio ns in the temperature gradients can be "},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"engineered artificially by very simple means. Moreover with the aid of this knowledge, one of the most recent an d supposedly greatest achievements air warfare - can be eliminated easily. Present systems of powering aircraft with propellers operate against the laws of Nature, and it could therefore be said that flying today is an excep- tionally risky game of chance. Indeed, it could almost be said that even one untoward ray of sunlight could bring it to an abrupt end. The basis of this assertion, and the reason why glider p ilots can remain aloft at certain hours only, will be addressed in subsequent chapters. 71 Since aviation is still in its infancy, and in view of the limited experience gained over the few years since its inception, this should not be taken as a reproach. If, on the other hand, we examine wh at is perhaps the most ancient of technologies, the rafting of timber, and if we also consider that this method of timber transportation is still practis ed today in spite of the destruction and incalculable damage it has wrought, then no word is strong enough to criticise this unbelieva ble thoughtlessness. Through the removal of forest, the m eans of transportation - water - is laid bare to the elements. The inevitable outcome of this is the destruction of the channel. With the channel in such a condition, the controller of rafting operations adds to the problem by rel easing even more water from holding basins. What is thus achieved is preci sely what was not wanted, or should be avoided. Instead of being carried fo rward, logs will be thrown broadside to the current and stranded. To guard against this, the forester then creates his embankment works, 72 which incidentally were also adopted by river engineers later on. Revetments, stone encasements, guideways, groins and transverse barriers are now supposed to hold the timber away from the bank. Briefly the effect is as follows: in company with the wa ter, timber flows along the now smooth, steeply raking embankment wall in similar fashion to water sliding along the slippery body of the fish. Significantly larger tur- bulences are created. The encased-stone wall will quickly be undermined following Nature's hydraulic laws, and collapse after a short time. As long as these wall-surfaces hold out, the turbulent water-masses will be forced into a completely unnatura l flow-form. Because of this, the timber surges ahead too rapidly, and all means of controlling the wa ter are lost. Intensified in this process, counter -forces flow around the end of the reconstructed 71 Unfortunately these subsequent chapters 72 The root of the German word Uferverbauung . never came, because upon Prof. Philipp employed here is verbauen, which can also mean Forchheimer's death, under whose sponsorship 'to bodge up' or 'to jerry-build', and it is a mat- these articles in Die Wasserwirtschaft were writ- ter of conjecture what emphasis Viktor ten, all further papers by Viktor Schauberger Schauberger actually intended ! - Ed. were refused publication - Ed. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"embankment and demolish i t . Having passed the revetment, the accumulat- e d energies attack the now-unprotected bank with increased force and destroy it altogether. This makes further bank stabilisation imperative. Thus an endless string of revetments are built at enormous cost, which not only make all useful floatation of timber impossible, but also are precisely the most dangerous flow-guides in time of flood. Potentia l forces are genera ted and a ccumulat- ed at these guiding structures. Far below in the valley, where no dangers existed previously, destructive effect s will suddenly be unleashed which act equally as unexpectedly as they do a bnormally, laying valuable farmland to waste, 73 which is scarce enough anyway wi thout this forest-destroying tech- nology. In fact, because of these measures, a stage has already been reached where, almost without exception, al l the once-healthy alpine streams, abounding in fish, are now in a positively ruinous condition and devoid of fish-life. In time of flood these wa terway ruins convey vast quantities of sediment down into the valley, causing unparalleled havoc, only to dry up again during normal times. Hydro-electric plants being built today are responsible for all the rest of the dama ge. If our hydraulic engineers contin- ue with their present methods, and should they eventu ally seize upon the last high-lying healthy reserves of wate r, then in a few decades we will live to see the day when all the power-stations, built at vast expense, stand empty. In the process we sh all also lose the last ves tiges of fertile soil which today, even if already in short supply, is nevertheless still available to us. As long as the forester remains wi thin the bounds of practicability, the stream that flows out of almost every forest will deliver th e accrued interest, the timber, almost without cost. If the forester (already a forest-despoiler) continues to employ his present methods, altering the fundamental form in which forest flourishes (by clear-felling) , then Nature will protect herself. The wholesale clearing of forest very quickly leads to the destruction of watercourses and to the ruination of a previously-profitable means of trans- port. The felling of a forest with limited acces s to water is no longer worth- while, even if the distance to the water is slight, and the forest is thereby saved at humanity's expense. 74 Alternative systems of transport such as for- est railways have seldom proved economic in the long run, because they require extremely large quantities of timber in order to bring in a return on 73 The frequently-reported floods in the 1980s and fe lling of timber as such, since he considered it 1990s in Bangladesh similarly derive from recent an extremely useful natural commodity.

In such cases the efforts of entrepreneurs to balance books through rigorous exploitation of forest ha s i ntroduced such dangers to the national economy - that once a governm ent becomes truly aware of the sen ousness of the situation, it will have to enact the harshest of restrictive mea- sures. It is unthinkable that water should be controlled by mathematical formu- lae alone. The proper management of water above all demands a sense of commitment an d great sensitivity, similar to that of a good doctor. There are unmistakable symptoms in re lation to the management of water which should once more be summarised briefly. As long as a waterway can transport timber unaided and therefore free of charge, the forester may use his axe. The deterioration of wate rways warns of th e dangers which, without exaggeration, most seriously threaten our own existence. As long as the trout continues to stand motionless in the water because food flows unaided into its jaws, then favourable conditions will also exist for humanity and for the ec onomy. If water exhibits destructive phenomena, if the trout becomes agitated and the timber begins to strand, then in the same ratio that the creatures in the water decline in quality, the conditions for all life will begin to disappear, conditions that those closely bound to their native soil can now no longer ov erlook. Contemporary methods of tor- rent-limitation, river regulation and hydr o-electric power generation in gen- eral will have to be changed radically. The increasing karst development in the upper reaches due to the contin- ued sinking of the groundwater table, the destruction and devastation of the cultivable land in the lower reaches, th e unruly and undisc iplined discharge of catastrophic floodwaters into the valley, the increasing development of swamps in low-lying areas, the constant increase in the severity of so-called 'natural' disasters occurring locally from year to year, the decline of agricul- ture and so on, in many instances can also be put down to the totally unnat- ural systems applied to the regulation of rivers. Large-scale regulatory works have be en put in hand without even the vaguest idea of the energetic princi ples governing Nature's processes and without an inkling of the most funda mental laws of the movement of water. These have radically altered the natural scheme of things and acted in garing contravention of the laws he re prevailing. Instead of bearing in mind the obvious fact that forest and high-altitude vegetation are just as essential as the skin on the body, ev erything possible has been done to destroy Nature's truly marvellous in terdependencies, which otherwise are almost indestructible. In the belief that forest exists to be exploited for every conceivable pur- pose, every effort has been made not only to plunder what Nature needs for life and for the maintenanc e of the soil as objects for vulgar speculation, but"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"on top of everything, to destroy them through t o t a l l y perverse practices. The most discouraging aspect is that in spite of all the bad experiences, those absurd methods of regulation a nd forest management are still fol- lowed today. Through such methods the forest, the prime necessity for cul- ture of any kind, must de monstrably die as a result of measures presently applied by the responsible authoritie s. In no single instance can it be demonstrated that the regulation of even a small stream was carried out without fault. Millions of people are already unemp loyed. Thousands of farms are in danger of collapse. Even very inge niously-constructe d machines are no longer able to work th e exhausted soil in such a way that the energy expended is in proportion to the yield. Through devastation of forest and misguided regulation of our rivers the state of equilibrium in Nature's household has been disturbed. Such a cr isis in agriculture and forestry, directly responsible for all other economic upsets, could never have occurred had forest and water been treated even half-way intelligently. In every way the hydraulic engineer has treated the waterways no better than the forester the forest. In view of the close connection between forest and water, it therefore comes as no surprise that channels are in an even more disproportionately dismal state than the forest. Even at a time when thousands are des titute for lack of work, it is almost pointless to wait and see wh ether humanity, who has already lost all con- nection with Nature, will not only continue to destroy all further existence, but also shatter the very last hope of recovery. In reality, twice as many are required to arrest the total economic collapse that threatens us, which can only happen, if the mistakes that have b een made so far are rectified as fast as humanly possible. This depends on whether the forest can be built up again as it once was and must always be, and if the channels are brought into balance once more through the construction of suitably designed reser- voirs, so that at the very least they can keep to a tolerably regular course for the time being and generate healthy water again in order that healthy blood can once more be supplied to flora and fauna alike. Tractive Force Considered [From Mensch und Technik, Spec.ed. relating to rivers [Vol.2,1993, Sec.8 Author's Notes from 7 July 1939] The less the tractive force of a waterway, the more it lacks the inne r cohering tensions that hold its body together. The result of these losses of tension is seen in the outfall and deposition of th e sediment that furnishes a properly flowing stream with the provisions for its journey. Whatever these sedimen- "},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"tary substances have surrendered to their former creator in terms of their intrinsic valence, will once more be earefully deposited on the riverbank, there to be painstakingly decomposed by the Sun and in this way conduct- ed back into the renewing cycle of life. In a healthy waterway the water-fila- ments migrate from the banks towards th e centre and to the bed. Cradled in a normal profile, such rivers flow away tranquilly and crystal-clear, the teeming fish-life bearing witness to the superior quality of such water. If the water's tractive force disappears due to the inner-atomic de-energis- ing caused by incorrect profiling, sensel ess straightening or direct solar irra- diation, then the depth of the sediment bed-lo ad increases and every widening of the banks and flattening of the bed is followed by a deepening. As a result the insipid, warming water loses the last of its inner supportive substances. Becoming stale and tired, it winds itself here and drags itself there in order to find the substances that sustain its very existence. In this condition the 'expert Pied Pipers of Hamlin' overpower the wate r and force it into narrow, straightened channels. The water flows through such trunca- tions on a steeper path. Compressed between walls, it actually does flow faster and even transports its sedime nt conscientiously and diligently. This type of tractive force, however , is only very short-lived. After a lengthy interval the flow-regime again changes drastically. Immediately below the regul atory works the mechanically accelerated water again begins to disgorge its sediment. As a result of this deposition, the channel inevitably widens again. Such widening can be observed after every narrowing and thus the evil described above is ma rkedly aggravated. To counteract the effects of the widening of the channel, dams are built. This ultimately gives the water the possibility of annihilating everything at one fell swoop. During the day the insolated water is a loose-knit, element-hungry entity into which the Sun impresses its substances. At night the temperature falls and with it the water's inner tension. Energetic essences of an immature, highly polarised nature 75 come into being as a re sult, which as manifesta- tions of a less developed order of life, requi re new nutritive energies. They therefore steal from the soil surrounding the channel, taking those elements needed for their own sustenance and propagation. The discharging of the surrounding soil, both energetically and materiall y, and its nascent unwhole- someness is therefore the result of the improper regulation of the river. 75 Described in the original German as extreme monopolar condition, a condition Differenzstoffe (difference-substances). This where their differences are equally extreme, refers to diverse elements, essences, or etherici- hence the expression 'difference-substances'. In ties, whose mutual differences or natural char- this unbalanced state they develop an extreme acteristics are, or have been, intensified for one attraction, or hunger, for their counterpart, a reason or another. In other words, they are in a thirst which until assuaged, disables them from highly polarised state, their various charges and any creative or formative activity. - Ed. potentials thereby approaching a more or less "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Early in t h e morning when the Sun begi ns to shine again, fertilisation processes take place within and between these diverse essences and what- ever is of high quality ri ses upwards and the next higher life-forms evolve in the water. These we describe as bacteria, which have come into being through the ethericitical fertilisation pr ocesses discussed previously. As long as sufficient supplementary material is still present in the riverbank, which as dynagens charge the water upstream for many kilometres, then viewed superficially, the pattern of flow will va ry only slightly. This happens if the original direction of radiation has reversed through the change in polarity. However, if the surrounding soil beco mes impoverished, then the water, now no longer able to obtain its life-g iving essences from the transverse potential-field, begins to appease its inner hunger by taking from the longi- tudinal axis. In this way the water ex tracts its life-energies from the direc- tion lying closest to its source. In ot her words, it begins to discharge the upper reaches and thus, conditioned by the ensuing drop in tension, the deposition of sediment increases in thos e places that were previously regu- lated or where the sediment was forcibly transported a little further due to mechanical influences. Despite th e re-supply of energy from upstream, tongue-like patterns of deposition form initially in the lower areas, which become broader and broa der, ultimately silting up the channel entirely. In earlier treatises it was clearly proven that in an average channel, the losses in tractive force arising from the inner de-energising of the water- body, are in the order of 30-50 milli on horsepower, or 20-40 million kilo- watts. It is common knowledge that in Nature nothing is ever lost, but always reappears in potentiated form. Every substance is bipolar and hence the ceaselessly recycling energies can be potentiated in either a beneficial or a destructive manner. A watercourse that has been conven tionally regulated gives no-one any peace and year by year the maintenance costs of such a channel increase. This well-known fact is ample proof th at the character and quality of regu- lated rivers do not improve, but deteri orate. Now high and dry, the particles of sediment lie directly in the path of the scorching rays of the Sun. The metabolic processes generated in the stones by the alternation of night and day, lead eventually to their disinteg ration. The sedimentary particles that normally charge and disc harge themselves from the ground upwards and from above downwards, invert their ch arges. In this fa shion those sub- stances that in the normal course of events the air r eceives indirectly via the water and the plants, now pass directly into the atmosphere. This results in a massive increase in the highly polarised essences, because the formative and distributive pathways so vital to Nature have been disrupted. Inferior and thus unsuited to the formation of the atmosphere, these undeveloped essences or substances of lower origin, i.e. th e masses super-saturated by "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"solar radiation - deploy themselves horizontally, breeding surreptitiously and wait for just the right mo ment to return to their terrestrial habitat or to recharge themselves on the Earth. This fall to Earth will be caused through disturbances in the formation of the air, which also result in the excessive propulsion of the higher essences of life to even higher regions. The atmosphere's harmonious equilibrium having thus become unstable, de-ene rgising phenomena now occur in the air. These, however, take effect in a manner completely di fferent from those previously described in water. The de-e nergising of the air gives rise to the condensation of the remaining aeriform substances into wh ich the essences of inferior provenance ha ve now become incorporated. These return into the Earth as the water suddenly plummets earthwards. At this point something happens, which is crucially important for later developmen ts and to which the strictest attention must be paid. Coolness follows rain. This happens be cause the falling ra in attracts those substances to itself, which were still too infe rior for a later, higher outbirth. Should these substances be intrinsical ly beneficial, then they act on the Earth in a benevolently potentiated way. If they are unwholesome sub- stances, however, then the potentiated unwholesomeness expresses itself in a rapidly proceeding deterioration. To get some idea of the elemental forc es that destroy a river and the water in improperly regulated channels, we must once again draw mathematical parallels and refer to the tractive for ces mentioned earlier, so that we can construct a half-way useful concepti on. In a channel conducting about 500 cubic metres per second, about 60 million horsepower or 50 million kilo- watts are lost, if it is warmed to about +22°C on hot days. These tractive energies are the dragging, suctional fo rces appearing in the whole water- body. They endeavour to extract negative dynagens from the sediment so that, together with the phos-substances 76 implanted by the Sun, interactions resulting in the form ation of new water can take pl ace. These events are nec- essary so that the flattening gradients in the valley can be overcome through the increasing weight of the watermasses. This ener getic discharge from the female substances of the sediment can only occur, however, with very spe- cific vertical graduations in temperature. In ot her words, the relation between surface and bottom water must accord with a particular tempera- ture gradient. 77 76 It is not clear what substances and properties light (or other electromagnetic radiation) on non- Viktor Schauberger was referring with the term thermal stimulation\" and it also has the property phos-substances, but in Phaidon Concise of converting \"ultraviolet radiation into visible Encyclopaedia of Science and Technology, phospho- light.\" - Ed. rus is referred to as being \"of great biological impor- 77 Here a positive temperature-gradient from tance\".

In consequence, no interactions and no formation of new water can take place. Water unsupported by increase and renewal slowly dies al ong its course and eventually the stream dries up. The counte rpart to tractive energies are the hitherto unknown impact forces, which appear when large quantities of rain suddenly fill up a channel that has lain dry for a long period. We shall now describe in greater detail the extraordinarily mysterious development of these impact forces to understand how they can be har- nessed to drive organic machines. Thr ough the rapid cooling of the atmos- phere after a downpour or a hailstorm, the water cools faster than the surrounding ground. The outco me of this non-uniform cooling is the emer- gence of a horizontally pr opagated potential. In th e rapidly cooling water the previously incorporated phos -substances become concentrated. Under the sudden influence of cold, the female dynagens in the sediment begin to radiate their energies. Due to th is reversal of inner tension, massive interactions take place in the opposi ng substances. Through these sudden inter-exchanges the creation of young water, or the strong precipitation of hydrogen occurs, which seeks to obtain its perfective or formative essences from the surrounding soil or the overlying air. A pressure potential evolves, which proceeds from the centre of the water sideways and upwards. This pressure potential, which acts at right angles to the direction of flow, impedes the draining water's normal ax ial motion. In the process transverse water-mountains form, whic h under certain conditions can reach a height of 80 cm. These forces are considerably greater than the heavy, mud-filled water flowing down a steep gradient. Small fluctuations in temperature in the flow cross-section, which result from the cultivation or de forestation of the riverb anks, cause the axis of these transverse barrel-vortices to in cline downwards. Highly charged with pressural energies, these heavy watermasses impact against the banks and in this dangerous state can even de stroy metre-thick wa lls, because the wall's pores have become permeable to them and in the structure of the soil or the wall further interactions occur, whose effect is positively explosive. These explosions in water can be demonstrated experimentally and, since we are here concerned with high-tensi on, hydrolytic interactions, under cer- tain circumstances act like liquid (compressed) air. Tractive forces are the suctional forces evolving in the longitudinal axis. Pressural forces are the impact-forces developing in the transverse axis, whose potency is greater than the former. These laterally-operating, imped- ing forces normally prevent the over-rapid descent of the water on very steep gradients and represent the wa ter's remote-contro lled brake as it were. Up to now these hydraulic brak es have remained entirely unnoticed. "},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Similar processes in our own bodies are responsible for the circulation of the blood. The whole movement of sap is also to be attributed to the forma- tion of tractive and impact forces, whic h function in a si milar manner. The high wave-trains in southern seas afte r sunset, the incidence of heavy surf and all ebbing and flooding are also to be ascribed to these inner energetic interactions. In the final analysis the movement of the Gulf Stream is the product of these powerful impact forces, which come into being through a form of water-thunderstorm. Vertical water-squalls are initially triggered off, which then ebb away in any direction and have an effect as far as 1,000 km away. The formation of storms, hurricanes and notoriously dangerous cyclones in the atmosphere are to be attributed to similar causes. These potentially destructive elem ental forces, which on o ccasion have been trig- gered involuntarily, may be harnessed to useful work in miniature machines in the future. The greater the number and operation of such machines, the fewer the number of catastrophes that can arise. In the future Mothe r-Earth will again be able quietly to build up her energising substances in all peace, which today are so foolishly combusted. In Nature there is only a certain 'either - or', the 'I can live' or the \"We can destroy'. Outwardly the 'I-life' is animated mass. The 'We-life' are more highly evolved ra ces that can affect the ' I-life'- consciousness beneficially or detrimentally, depending on whether humani- ty correctly or incorrectly influences the stupendous synthesis, which is far from finished with the shaping of hum anity. It would be absolutely wrong to say that after this life there is no later existence. This after-life, however, is a phenomenon, which in its progress towards the Divine, congregates together in groups and no longer has any I-con- sciousness, but is absorbed by even higher powers through the agency of longitudinal and transverse potentials. It either directs itself upwards or downwards and annihilates everything, if, through senseless intrusions and blunders on Earth, a foolish mankind dist urbs this ur-mighty course of evo- lution in order to exploit the forces that equip Natu re, which are the founda- tion for the whole formation of life. To exonerate the nature-alienated experts responsible for this, on the gr ounds of ignorance and thus a certain innocence, does nothing for the hundreds of millions of their fe llow human beings, who have to atone for their folly and forgo whatever little joy of life they have, merely because these so-c alled erudite have been so stupid.

Concerning Rivers and Water Viktor Schauberger had a long correspond ence with Dr Dagmar Sarkar in the early 1950s, during which time, having much confidence in her ability, he asked her to translate all his works into Englis h. This she unfortunately had no time to do. Upon moving to India with her Indian diplomat husband, she did, however, continue to promote Schauberger's ideas by publishing a number of his articles and letters from their corre spondence. I first became acquainted with Dr Sarkar in 1977 when she agreed to check the accur acy of my first translations. This con- tact was maintained over the intervening years during which a long correspon- dence and friendship de veloped. This passage of Vikt or Schauberger's and one or two others were kindly made available to me by Dr Sarkar for inclusion in the overall translations. - [Editor] The naturalesque conduction of flow ing water is by no means a simple matter. It is an art demanding prof ound, empathetic insight and sensitive awareness. This is absolutely lacking in the hydraulicists concerned with the matter. Because of this th ere is hardly a waterway which is still healthy and which acts on the environment in an i nvigorating way. Hen ce, in the natura- lesque conduction of wate r, the following should be taken into account: 1. the normal profile, which comes into being automatically through a bio- dynamic form of motion; 2. the rotation about its own axis or about its true, higher self, the T, which is a secondary result of a normal profile; 3. the purposive isolation th rough naturalesque deposition of the film of sediment; 4. the possibility for the water's up-we lling, overarching curvature, which is enabled through vertical and horizontal curves. Plan and elevation are therefore one and the same, for only in this way can circumfluence take place. As a further consequence, an inner restructurin g and qualitative enhancement thus comes about. The water is then endowed with the"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"power to build up its protective external skin, which ensures water's contrasting status in relation to oppositely-energised surrounding through which metabolic processes can take place in all dimensions - in solid, liquid, gaseous, etheric and en ergetic states. Such water breathes, pulsates and is healthy. If it is unable to build up its sealing skin, then it dies like a human being whos e skin has been burnt off. Nothing could be more absurd, therefor e, than to increase the geological gradient by channel-trun cation, because in this case, owing to its self- weight, the water overruns itself. In the same way that a wrongly-ploughed field loses its soil-energy and soul-for ce (psyche), water also loses its inner nature if its maternalistic , uplifting (levitati ng) forces are missing. The same is also true if sediment is not di ssolved by biodynamic processes and is unable to release the formative substances it contains. The Sun can both build up and break down water. Every new entity can evolve only in its own amniotic flui d. Whoever would increase water must not only take note of the Sun-god's pat h, but also afford him the possibility of fertilising the water up-welling towards him in a naturalesque way. The more intimately a nd aggressively the contra-directional, contra- potentiated substances interact with each other, the more active and cool the given substance becomes. However, if Man organises a watercourse the same thing happens as occurs in the forest, wherein true chaos comes into being through his mortifying order, out of which disease-causing [or patho- genic] bacteria evolve. In every substance there is an innate drive to change itself in order to become mobile. If we move naturale squely, then throug h the metamorpho- sis of substance or thr ough the inauguration of a naturalesque metabolism, we achieve the desired velocity or rais e the efficiency. In such an instance we are operating economically and in a fuel-saving fashion. If we move unnaturally, then we achieve the oppos ite. The regulation of a watercourse - bank rectification - results in the intern al decay of water' s substance and in its disappearance - which we can pr eserve through its organisation. Every change in a substance acts to create a resistance which impedes the otherwise-unbridled intensif ication of the will-to-chang e. Without this resis- tance there would be no sustained mo vement and no animation or enliven- ment. This self-increasing resistance actually becomes the life-force itself. For this reason th e product of the concentrat ion of matter only has any value if it has undergone the highest qualitative ennoblement or the pro- foundest debasement, either naturally or artificially. Only in this way can kinetic energy be raised. The longer the developmental path or process, the shorter the developmental period become s. Conversely, a purposive short- ening of the reversed developmental pa th or the shortening of the reconsti- "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"tuting period signifies an acceleration of moveme nt and an increase in kinetic energy. A purposive organisation of the aforementioned metabolic forces, however, enables the elimination of resistance at virt ually no cost. In this case motional resistance decreases by the square of the velocity, where- vy unimaginable outputs can be achieved with the sm allest input of energy. Today's technology has not investigated the will-to-change in all matter, but has built a motion-inhibiting resistan ce into all machines. The Transport of Sediment Fundamental Principles for the Floatation of Timber, Ore and other Materials Heavier than Water [An excerpt from Tau 137, ppl2-15.] 1. Water is no lifeless substance, but an organism. It is the blood of the Earth, subjected to an uninterrupted in terchange of substance (metabolism), causing a constantly-changing pattern of movement. Water is the carrier of substances which condition life. All we see around us has been built up by powerful forces that dwell in water. Once we understand the fundamental law governing this gigantic developmenta l process, then we shall also be in a position to shape all we see around us creatively, in the way that Nature shows us. Everything flows, floats and moves. There is no state of equilibri- um - there is no state of rest. If we wa nt to live, then we must become initi- ates and understa nd the universe and its inner conformities with natural law. We must bow down before Nature, who has given all of us, and will continue to give us what we see, feel and hear, once we take heed of that which gives us life: the dynagens inhering in water. 2. The product of these metabolic proc esses is motion. Tractive force and rate of flow are conditioned by the temperature gradient. The temperature gradient is thus the regulator of movement. 3. A particular profile is contingent on a particular temperature distribu- tion, which in tu rn determines the molecula r distribution of matter. Conversely, a particular molecular dist ribution determines a particular tem- perature distribution, which on its part determines the profile. The develop- ment of the profile and the disposition of the river-bends is thus a question of the organisation of the various wa ter temperatures. Water temperatures are opposites, and these opposites conditi on life and determine the type of motion. 4. The composition of channe l wall-surfaces de termines the coefficients of friction and the distribution of heat and cold as actual substance. Rough wall-surfaces or inbuilt rifling increase frictional surfaces and the incidence"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"of heat. Where heating occurs, tractive force dimi nishes. Reduction in trac- tive force means deposition of sediment - stranding and therefore the for- mation of the riverbanks. Through the withdrawal of heated matter from the water, cooling oc curs in the flow-axis, and with this a raising of tractive force in the same. The core water-mass es forge ahead and deepen the centre of the channel. Advancing water sinks vertically along the axis and sus- pended matter is conducted down the cen tre, because it is here that the channel is being deepened. Suction forces evolve in the core-wat er body, because he re the translatory velocity is greater relative to the peri pheral flows. This phenomenon results in reduction of pressure on the riverb ank. Due to these cen tripetal forces, the walls of the riverbanks are relieved of pressure to such an extent that the walls merely serve to render the banks watertight and impermeable. This impermeability is achieved through sedimentation (the deposition of the finest particles of sediment - silt). This is a necess ity, because in this way a vital separation is maintained be tween surface water and groundwater. 5. The more specifically dense and more homogeneous the core water- masses, the more buoyant the suspended matter becomes. 78 The greater the volume and velocity of the core water- masses, the more pow erfully the cen- tripetal forces act to draw the periph eral flows towards the central axis of the current. The outcome of this is a progressive reduct ion in pressure on the riverbanks, an increase in the tractiv e force of the core water-masses, an increase in the mean overall dept h of the water table (groundwater recharge) and an increas e in buoyancy of the co re water-masses, whose homogeneity increases with dept h - they become more laminar. In this way suction is created with a commensurate increase in tractive force, causing th ose particles of sediment heavie r than water and of a partic- ular grain-size to be sucked into the specifically-heaviest core-zone. There the greatest density and hence the great est flow-velocity prevail, and thus the resistance to flow is also here at a minimum. Bodies heavier than the core water-masses will be carried down the cen- tral axis through the combined effect of centripetal, negative pressure and translatory velocity. Because it moves more slowly, sediment (sand, dye- stuffs, dirt) lighter than water will be ejected laterally and progressively deposited according to weight. The closer to the bank, the lighter the sub- stances deposited. 6. Heavy, centrally-conducted particles of sediment will be reduced in size mechanically through thei r mutual abrasion. The st ored energies in these energy concentrations will be released and subsequently absorbed into cold core water-masses. 79 In this way the status of water is enhanc ed biologically, 78 Water density and weight equals or is greater than that of the suspended matter. - Ed. 79 See footnote 4- Ed."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"which process extends to the vitalisation and stimulation of the groundwa- ter body, which now has to move on its part - and it rises. The fertility of the soil increases. 7. River regulation with the aid of the temperature gradient signifies: • the possibility of transporting bodies , whether lighter or heavier than water, up to 90% more ch eaply than hitherto has been the case with all other systems of transport, by expl oiting the natural rhythms of motion (normal profile); • an automatic development of a normal profile, and • the raising of the groundwater table and an increase in soil productivity. 8. Contemporary systems of river regulation cause: • loss of the cheapest means of transport; • the deterioration of the waterways; • the sinking of the grou ndwater table and a decl ine in soil fertility. 9. Accordingly, current systems of river regulation (temperature gradient disregarded) lead to the aggravation of the crisis. This leads to pollution of the channel, disappearance of water and an increase in diseases - economic decline. 10. Future systems of river regulati on (temperature gradient considered) consequently help to over come the crisis and the re habilitation of the whole. It leads to decontamination of channe ls, increase in wa ter through promo- tion of the necessary interaction betw een opposites, and to economic growth.

Viktor Schauberger, Vienna, June 1935."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"The Rhine and the Danube The Problem of the Danube Regulation [From Implosion Magazine No. 23.] Viktor Schauberger conducted a long battle with the scientific and government institutions of his day to save the Rhine and the Danube from total ruin but it was a battle which was ultimately lost th rough their rejection of his practical sug- gestions. In early 1932 he wrote a pape r about the rehabilitation of the Danube, detailing the measures that needed to be taken in order to reinstate the once-mag- nificent river to its former glory. This paper was included in The Danube, a study undertaken by the International Danube Commission. Upon discovering Viktor's contribution to this major work, however, of ficials decided, at great cost, to recall and destroy the whole edition. When it was republished in October of that year, it was without Viktor's offend ing article. All this happened largely due to the actions of Viktor Schauberger's impl acable antagonist, Dr Ehrenberger, who hounded him wherever he went. - [Editor] he enormous, general and ec onomic importance of the Danube, already eulogised in the Song of the Nibelungs, is fully established by the fact that every country wishes to have access to it. A special International Danube Comm ission has been established which is concerned with all related technical and economic questions. Although the most highly qualified experts are engaged in the study of all the hydraulic engineering problems, year after year the daily newspapers report on the catastrophes occurring during times of flood, which lead to particularly grave conse- quences, for the very reason that th e protective measures set in place by man have failed. Up to now attempts have always been made to incr ease the efficiency and thus the stability of protective struct ures by strengthening them. These con- structions - the result of taking only the mechanical factors of hydraulic engineering into account, while completely neglecting the equally impor- tant physical aspect of th e processes - have not only not fulfilled their pur- poses, but in the course of time ha ve also caused in estimable damage. Thus through the regulatory works in the upper and middle reaches of the Danube, 950,000 hectares of producti ve land were transformed into a T"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Flood plain, thereby being rendere d useless for agriculture. Even In Yugoslavia (Serbia) whole vi llages had to be evacuat ed and their inhabitants relocated at the state's ex pense. Professor Vidrasku of Budapest wrote about this in the Neue Freie Presse (New Free Press) as follows: \"Unfortunately, in the belief that construction of huge dams on the banks of the Danube would suffice, works were begun without having studied the problem in sufficient detail.\" He continues: \"If we were to eliminate flooding with massive, high dams, and no longer permit inundation of the flood plain, then the floodwater would rise so high that all our river-ports and all riparian settlements along the Danube would be under water. Moreover, river and lake navigation, which even today is unsatisfactory, would be significantly impaired, and the dams themselves would offer no additional security.\" A further excellent and informative exam ple relates to the raising of the riverbed of the Rhine at Salez. The valley cross-section shows that the Rhine flows along an elevated plateau, its bed lying up to 4m (13ft), and its flood- peak of 1890, 7-8m (23-26f t) above the lowest point of the valley, ultimately intersecting the rooftops of the village s in the low-lying areas. With good reason Mr Otto Rappolt, a chief govern ment surveyor, states in his book River Engineering (Flussbau, published by Goschen Sammlung) that: \"The deforestation of the catchment area a nd the system of river rectification is to be considered the principal cause of this hazardous predicament. Thus every impor- tant river in Europe provides us with suff icient cause to consider the consequences that incorrect river regulation can draw in its wake. The rivers Etsch, Po and Tagliamento in particular will present the Italian Government with many more problems as well as swallowing up considerable amounts of capital, if a radical departure in present government policy is not made.\" Thus every major river-system provides us with examples of the conse- quences resulting from faulty river engineering. In order now to arrive at the right results, it is necessary to au gment the mechanical aspects of the process with physical infl uences, of which the most crucial are the tempera- ture gradient, the variation in specific weight and the occu rrence of material metamorphoses. The enormous signifi cance attaching to the temperature gradient is best perceived from the fact that to heat up 1 m 3 of water by only 0.1°C - and such variations in wate r temperature are to be found in almost every channel cross-section - roughly 42,700kgm are required. From this it is evident what tremendous energies are freed with a reduction in tempera- ture or bound with an increase in the same. Both 'positive' and 'negative' forms of water movement, which hitherto have been referred to by their outer appearance and described as 'laminar' or 'turbulent' flows, represent unknown magnitudes in the equation to be solved. From this equation are to be derived the great fundamental laws of formation and growth, which not on ly enable autonomous development, "},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"but also the degeneration of all forms of vegetation and the here equally important laws of destruction. Under the term temperature gradient is to be understood the variation in water temperature during its movement. Water, whose temperature gradi- ent approaches +4°C (whether or not th is approach is from high or almost- freezing temperatures is immaterial), we can consider as being under the influence of a positive temperature gradient. Water whose temperature diverges from +4°C we de scribe as being under a negative temperature gra- dient. At the ground-surface, under the influence of the atmosphere, water in a positive temperature gradient wi ll accumulate its oxygen groups while its carbone groups will be uniformly distribut ed within it. Al so its flow will converge, its bed will be hollowed out into a semi-circle, its tractive force will increase and its flow will accelerate - in other words, it will assume a straight-line motion. Conversely, if wa ter flows under a negative tempera- ture gradient it disper ses its oxygen groups, accum ulates its carbones, absorbs large quantities of atmospheric air and in the same ratio loses its tractive force, deposits its transporte d matter, gravel, sand and dissolved gaseous carbones. In the organism of th e Earth, water is therefore a carrier of oxygen and carbone groups, and at the same time it is a carrier of all the organic processes which act to build up all life in Natu re. The exchange between these two groups of substan ces is not only of crucial importance for the formation of all organisms, bu t also for the behaviour and character- istics of water itself. Proceeding from the basic premise th at surface and groundwater flows are actually arteries whose sole purpose is to convey various substances to the environment, we arrive at the follo wing perception. If a river is badly regulated, it not only results in frequent sinking of the groundwater table, thus affecting the vegetation, but the ve getation itself will also be seriously afflicted due to physical causes. If, in relation to its surroundings, such water is under a negative temperature gradient - comparatively warmer oxygen-rich water, hungry for carbones, is present in the channel - it will extract carbones from a wide area and instead of being impressed into the root-zone, these carbones will be drawn towards the greater attracting force - the channel. This result s in constant and progress ive decline of the vegeta- tion in such areas. Instead of going into the ground, the water enters the widening channels and as a result of too high a temperature, it is transferred to the atmosphere too rapidly. In this process not only is the full hydrologi- cal cycle unfavourably affected, bu t dangerous flood catastrophes must inevitably follow. In future stream and river regulation we have finally to abandon the con- temporary perverted, materialistic way of looking at things, which views water merely as an element destin ed to drive numerous power-stations"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"along its course, to be the recipient of watts water and to be conducted to the see by the shortest possible route by wa y of a whole series of hydraulic paraphernalia. Water's appointed tasks in Nature's housekeeping, which are to a large extent still insufficiently evaluated, must once more be taken into account. The large measure of purposefulness in natural life and water's vital role must be properly understood once and for all, and attempts should no longer be made to control wate r with extremely expen- sive, totally irratio nal mechanical means of coercion. In the following the grossly discounted physical processes of metabolism will be addressed - this metabolism takes place between oxygen and carbones groups and influences the development of the chan nel. These pr ocesses take place on a very small scale, even t hough in infinite succession. They are those pulsations which can be detected experimentally through the fluctua- tions in the water level in a Darcy-pipe or through the continuous fluctua- tions in the rotational velocity of Woltmann-vanes. 80 The oxygen-deficient water emerging from a spring absorbs oxygen from the air, which sinks to the bottom due to its molecular weight, whereas the water's content of car- bon-dioxide will be evenly dispersed by reason of the cold water's high capacity to absorb gases. Because of the warmer temperat ure-influences of the ground and the atmosphere active along its further course, spirally-dis- posed isotherms appear in the water. In the presence of aggressive oxygen (O 3 , ozone) in the oxygenated zone, the close packing of these isotherms leads to cold oxidations, through wh ich various highly complex carbone groups are formed under explosion-lik e events. The most highly-organised substances will subsequently be impelle d in part towards the riverbed and in part towards the banks, where they serve as raw material for the growth of the adjacent vegetation. Less-refined substances, during whose formation (explosions) minor energies only are re leased, are borne downstream under the influence of the current. Apart from this, a further effect of the explo- sions described above is to propel smaller suspended matter transported by the water from one epicentre of expl osion to the next and ultimately towards the riverbank. It is said that the water 'runs aground'. If the influence of the warm temperat ure persists, then water's content of carbonic acid escapes in familiar fashi on through the formation of carbon- dioxide bubbles, their place now being taken by oxygen, which distributes itself uniformly through the water. Sinc e this warmer water also has for the time being less tractive force, suspe nded matter sinks to the bottom. The water therefore finds itself in a de positing mode through the above- described explosions and also as a re sult of the reduction in tractive force engendered by the rise in temperature. 80 A Woltmann vane is hydrodynamically shaped device suspended in streams to measure the varia- tion in the velocity of flow. - Ed. "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The water now begins to extract fre sh car bones fro m i t s bed and banks, which cool it. Since the carbones now lie at the bottom and the oxygen is evenly diffused in the water above, explosions w i l l now occur in a direction opposite to the one previously described, which act in a 'shovelling' way. The water excavates. The excavating phase is then followed by a depositing phase. The carbones present in the deeper part of the channel profile become dispersed as they rise to wards the surface and the oxygen sinks towards the bottom, reintroducing the depositional phase. In this closed cycle of alternating deposition and removal, the quality of the water contin- ually deteriorates and it becomes 'sluggish and stale, lifeless and insipid'. This latter phenomenon has two main causes: (1) increase in water temperature and the associated decrease in specific weight, and (2) the fact that the water available at the beginning of each phase is always of poorer quality, because substances least ennobled by the explo- sions are driven downstream where they become the starting product for new explosions. As long as healthy conditions in the water prevail - as long as the proper proportions between the inner water-masse s, the bed-gradient and the tem- perature continue to exist - the incidence of turbulent phenomena will be stronger along the upper margins of the banks while constantly weakening towards the bottom, and the axis of the current will remain unchanged. The constantly-increasing strength of the external influence resulting from the widening of the channel reduces the water's tractive force. Towards evening the temperature gradient once more approaches a positive energy-form and during the night sediment will be transported further. At a suitable temper- ature the watercourse regulates itself au tomatically in ever y respect. With its temperature properly adjusted, the watercourse will not only widen itself in the proper proportion, but will also deepen itself appropriately in the lower reaches. Thus the longitudinal profile suited to the varying cross-section is formed automatically - a necessary matter for the removal of the sediment load, which under orderly forest conditions is in any case minimal. Where undisturbed by human hand, when flooding does occur in such waterways, the influence exerted from the outside on the increasing water-masses is stronger, due to the external temperature which as a rule is low at such times. The temperature gradient becomes positive and the now cooler water-masses drain at a greater velocity without attacking the banks. With the correct reversal of temperature, the influence of temperature gra- dient is greater than that of bed-grad ient, because the mass-transport of sed- iment will be appropriately regulated in proportion to the corresponding increase in flow-velocity. In this case, with an increase in the volume of water, the speed of forward motion will also be greater due to the proper "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"rearrangement of the temperature gradient. The increase in energy required to dislodge and transport the sediment in the lower reaches is achieved through the introduction of cold water from shorter affluent streams, with which the water temperature of the main channel becomes reduced. Even Weyrauch, in his book Hydraulic Calculation, admits that without affluent streams the boundary condition of the tractive force decr eases. In view of the above explanation, this phe nomenon would appear to be quite self-evident. From a mechanical point of view, according to Poseille's equation, the associated increase in internal viscosity increases by the square with a decrease in temperature, in the equation P = 16*pi* Y av where P remains constant due to the increase in the magnitude of Y, a lesser velocity v would already suffice to mainta in the state of equilibrium. However, since v will not be reduced as the bed-gradient is constant, the horizontal component a in the interplay of forces involved in the transport of sediment will be all the more activ e and hence the trac tive force will be greater. It should be mentioned here in passi ng that rivers flowing into the sea under a positive temp erature gradient (eg. into the Arctic Ocean) carry their sediment far out into the sea (haff formation), whereas rivers debouching into the ocean under a negative temperature gradient (e.g. the Nile) deposit their sediment prior to the confluence (delta formation) . At this juncture it is very interesting to note that according to Dr Schoklitz's laboratory experi- ments at the Technical University of Briinn, the law stating that the sedi- ment-load increases in proportion to the square of the depth holds true for grain-sizes of up to 4mm (0.16in). In this regard, at the Research Institute in Vienna, Professor Schaffernak has discovered a law which holds that the sediment load is 'directly proportional' to the increase in depth for grain- sizes of 100mm - 130mm (4-5in) commonly found in our rivers. Apart from this, we also discover a splendid array of inconsistencies amongst leading authors concerning the mechanical measures applied to hydraulic engineering as well as their mathematical treatment. Here atten- tion is to be drawn briefly to the ex tremely varied opinions concerning the value of the great Kutter fo rmula, to Tolkmitts' and Lindboes' critique of the Bazin formula, to the discussion about th e coefficients in Christen's velocity formula, and others. It is left to the arbitrary discretion of each individual to increase or decrease the mathematical accu racy through this or that formula convenient to him. Nature works uncomm only slowly. This is why it is also impossible to encompass the great processes which take place in Nature by means of laboratory experiments, because the proper preconditions and interrelations are lacking. For this r eason, in river engineering the causes of "},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"the resultant effects should only be studied in Nature's great examples. Observation over many decades is necessary in order to understand truly the infinitely fine, constantly increasi ng interplay of forces which are visible to the eye only by their mechanical ef fects, whereas the causes themselves mostly remain unnoticed and unheeded. The treatment of water by mathemati cal formulae alone is unthinkable. The proper handling of water requires gr eat interest and as the hydraulicist Robert Weyrauch stated so succinctly: \"In order to carry out river engineering pr ojects, an especial gift for hydraulics, an exceptional feel for what is hydraulically possible or impossible is necessary. This is only acquired with difficulty and even th e most experienced repeatedly suffer dis- appointments.\" We are reminded that those people who continue to believe that they can solve the difficult proble ms of river engineering and regulation by methods other than those indicated by Nature , have taken upon themselves a truly onerous responsibili ty and liability. The Rhine Battle [From TAU No. 142, p. 6. An open letter to the Austrian Prime Minister.] Quite a while ago, Mr We rner Zimmermann outlined to me the catastrophes which are to be anticipate d in the Rhinelands (St Galler, Rheintal) and which the daily newspapers are already discussing. The former Chancellor, Dr Ender, also described these perils to me in a similar fashion - perils which will happen if the overall level of the Rh ine cannot be lowered by a few metres. It is, and will be, impossible for this lowering to be successfully achieved through bank-rectification and dredgi ng. The dangers will inevitably be multiplied, precisely because these measures will re duce the tractive force, which is here the critical factor. This can only be remedied by the organisation of the ne cessary tractive forces. Sufficient proof of their absence is ev inced by the constant increase in the looming danger due to canalisation, truncation, and bank-correction. At the time, and with the support of the respected hydr ologist Dr Forchheimer and the world-renown scientist, his excellency Professor Wilhelm Exner, I fully intended to explain the reasons for th is heightened danger. Unfortunately these treatises were suppressed by cer tain bureaucratic institutions and because of this I was also unable public ly to refute the absolutely absurd explanations put forward by the Minister's river-engineering adviser, Dr Ehrenberger. Due to the pa ssing away of the Federal Chancellor, Dr Dollfuss, who repeatedly sought me out personally in this regard, I had no chance to explain the errors in Ehrenberger's report to him verbally. "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Prime Minister, please accept that the following explanations have no f inancial motive, but are founded purely on humanitarian grounds. As a result of a l l these personal at tacks, I renounce all pecuniary advan- tage and for this reason th e following explanations ar e intended to rehabili- tate the reputations of two people who have my highest respect and whose purely humane endeavours I cannot permit to be negated by arguments lacking in material facts. All motion of whatever kind is associ ated with an expenditure (loss) of energy, if on its moving path no rei nvigoration or nourishment of what is being moved takes place. Water conduct ed along a uniformly-profiled chan- nel is warmed by direct solar radiation or friction. Because of this warming, a slow but constantly active discharge of the essential intrinsic energies of atoms occurs, which results in losses in kinetic energy. These gradually increase and produce symptoms of fati gue, provoking the de position of sed- iment and causing the upward displacement of the riverbed. In order to heat 1 cubic metre of water by only 0.1°C (such variations in temperature are to be found in the smalle st channel cross-sections), work or an expenditure of energy in the order of 42,700 kgm is required. If 0.1°C = 42,700 kgm, then 1°C = 427,000 kgm and 20°C = 8,540,000 kgm or 114,000 hp/sec. The Rhine conducts about 500m 3 of water per sec ond, hence with a warming of 20°C, the total loss in hydraulic effici ency = 57,000,000 hp or 42,000,000 kW. Every 0.1°C increase in heat , therefore, signifies a considerable loss of energy, which must be replaced if extremely hazardous depositions of sediment are to be avoided. Dams are in effective in this regard, because one day the upstream gradient eventually flattens out through the continuous deposition of sediment caused by slowing water-fl ow, and the water therefore has to break out sideways. With this a flood catastrophe is already at hand. How can this flattening of the gradient be prevented? Only by the replace- ment of the necessary energies lost due to solar radiation. If we consider the energy-loss ensuing from a rise in temper ature of about 20°C, then it is also clear how vital it is to replace these losses in tractive force systematically. Through the strong ae ration occurring with accelera tion (truncatio n, canalisa- tion etc.) this loss is only exacerbated and for this reason other means must be applied in order to maintain the water's tractive force. These means are precise- ly those h itherto-unknown pulsation phenomena, which trigger off cooling effects. Rivers which cool off along their course carry their sediment far out into the sea due to the maintenance of their kinetic energies (haff-formation). Conversely, rivers which warm up along their course lose these energies, form deltas and shift their point of confluence. The great law with which Nature cont rols and directs flowing water has so far escaped science's notice. In wate r, two different processes of dissolu- "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"tion take place: (a) dissolution due to heat and the influence of light, and (b) dissolution due to cold and the absence of light and air. In case (a), matter transported by water in suspended form is insoluble. The release of energies contained in these substances is dependent on the occurrence of certain pr ocesses of ionisation, wh ich we know of from the \"photo-electric effect\". Positive or po sitively-charged me tals allow negative electrons to escape under co nditions of heat and light. With negative or neg- atively-charged metals the process is reversed under the exclusion of light and the influence of cold. Both forms of radiation are measurable and have a magnitude of about 2 volts, if groups of heteropolar metals 81 are present. Metals are found in all wa terways. On account of their weight, the specifi- cally-heaviest metals are first to sink to the bottom and are left lying there. The specifically-lighter parent rock from which they have been abraded travels further on. Thus in the lower reaches of a rive r a deficiency of metals and hence symptoms of fatigue (losses in tractive force) must take place, because no inner-atomic en ergies can be released for lack of ionisation. Freed energies can only be bound in th e absence of light and as the water cools. If the water is actually warm, then spallating energies (electrons) are necessarily lost to the at mosphere. In order that wa ter can become internally charged, every process of absorption must be followed by further reactions which can occur only if the temperature gradient is maintained at a certain low level of coolness. Th ese after-reactions are ph enomena of electrochemi- cal fusion. The gases are tr ansformed into electrozoic (animalistic or organ- ismic) energy-products. If this mutation cannot take place, then even the strongest ionisations are of no avail. If the temperature gradient is correct, then flowing water becomes an animalistic accumulator. Water which is too warm is acidiferous and electrically ove r-conductive, and be cause of this an inner discharge takes place which fatigues the substance itself. Dredging only aggravates the evil, because the heaviest (metalliferous) stones sink into the dredged hole s and in the main are lost . Through the emissions of inner-atomic energies, magnetic forces evolve which reduce the absolute weight of the sediment. As a result it behaves in a manner contrary to Archimedes' principle - the heavier (more metallifer ous) it is, the more buoyant it becomes. My system of regulation, or more a ccurately, my orga nisation of the water, results in the free floatation of stones or logs heavier than water down the axis of the river. This is because there the greatest cold prevails and the strongest processes of muta tion occur, which render the water gas- free, dense and therefore mobile. 82 81 heteropolar = of a molecule or compound being draining down a steady gradient has a greater or having a molecule in which there is an carrying capacity and tractive force than water uneven distribution of electrons and thus a per- with a high gas content.\" VS. in a letter to Dr. manent dipole moment. - Ed.

Energy-Bodies [From TAU No. 137, p.19. - Werner Zimmermann] Let us consider our problem child once more, the Rhine. Can one of three possibilities be of any assi stance here? The first two: reafforestation and the resultant re-creation of co ld affluent streams - these take too long and are too expensive to be able to satisfy immediate requirements. And the third: impounded lakes? Here too, in the case of the Rhine it would take a great deal of time and money before it coul d be realised pract ically. Is there a fourth possibility? The instal lation of energy-generating bodies in the axis of the surging water-body - and hence the cooling of the water. Here all the elements are lacking which enable us to assess how and whether such mea- sures can achieve the desired goal. It concerns the discoveries and inven- tions of our researcher - Viktor Schaube rger - and we must be satisfied once again with indications and hints. [From TAU No. 137, p. 27. - Viktor Schauberger] The lowering of the bed of the Rhine by 4-6m (13-20 ft) is simply a question of the status of the tractive force. This can only be solved by regulating water temperature and costs only a small fraction of what conventional systems of river regulation usually devour. Dredging is an absolutely absurd procedur e. One flood suffices to fill the dredged holes up again. Indeed it should be re membered that the amount "},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"of sediment brought down into the valley by the Rhine annually is estimat- ed at about 100,000m 3 (3,531,000 cu ft)! Every increase in the height of levees, however, only increases the danger of a breach, which is inevitable should a warm flood one day eventuate. They should commission me! Minimal expenditure will suffice to banish the danger forever. The successful regulation will be guaranteed. The regula- tory works will need only be paid for once the bed of the Rhine has sunk by about 2m (6ft6in). [From TAU No. 142, p.15. - Viktor Schauberger] As far as I am concerned, just what the study was all about is as follows. When I secretly installed these energising bodi es in the Steyrling stream about 14 years ago, within the space of one night the river was washed out to such a degree that hundreds of cu bic metres of sand and gravel were thrown up in great heaps into the so- called sand-trap. The stream sank right down to the bedrock overnight. 83 Just imagine what would happen if these energy-bodies were put to work in the middle reaches of the Rhine! Thousands of cubic metres of sediment would then be set in motion, and if gr eat care was not taken, then the dams would also collapse. At the limit of the effective action of these energy-bod- ies, the Rhine would break out sideways and inundate everything. Should this be undertaken prior to the confluence, then the Rhine would be lowered by about 6 - 8 metres and hundreds of thousan ds of cubic metres of sand and gravel would thoroughly fill the Bodens ee (Lake Constance) at the confluence. In this situation well-considered measures and extreme care are the only solution. The Rhine must first be repaired and then its flow organised. This repair- work extends across thr ee countries - Germany, Sw itzerland and Austria. Recuperating water actually begins to grow of its own accord (proof of this is provided by the Neuberg installation). For this reason torrent confinements should not merely be altered to prevent the descent of more sediment, but steps must also be taken to cope with the drainage conditions downstream. Why are these powerful effects produced by the installation of energy- bodies? The water's oxygen becomes fluid (a process similar to the produc- tion of liquid air), resulting in quite enormous metabolic activity in the water-body, which now attains its hi ghest level of energy. The water becomes crystal clear, fast-flowing and cold. The fish population increases because the water becomes energy-rich and healthy. As it flows along its course, the Rhine loses about half a million horsepow- 83 \"If water is additionally stimulated through the ores float like softwood.\" V.S. in a letter to Dr. introduction of metallic bodies, an increase in the Dagmar Sarkar, 1949 tractive force ensues with the result that stones and"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"er through the generation of heat.

The development of cold is motion-creating 84 and acts to release rays of negative energy. Through my measur es the character of the Rhine would c hange and it would become like a fa st-flowing mountain river. If nothing is done (the effects of dredging only accelerate the havoc), then one day the Rhine must break out and create a new bed, because in its old s ick-bed it can no longer move. Perhaps you now understa nd the jittery anxi- ety of today's river engineers and what they are liable for, once people experience the extent of the mistakes that have been made. There can only be one choice for courageous, upstanding men: to own up to their mistakes honestly (for to err is human) and to assi st personally in th e work of rectifi- cation and reconstruction. [From TAU No. 146, p.29. - Viktor Schauberger] When they want to make ice cream, cooks throw salt into ice-water, by which heat is bound. The water freezes if it is stirred at the same time. This is not to suggest that I advise that sa lt should be thrown into the Rhine, but that my advice is to not dredge the stones out of the Rhine. These stones contain salts which, under the right preconditions, cool the Rhine and increase its tractive force. If appropriate metals are caused to interact correctly with any given acid (such as water warmed and strongly oxygenated by the Sun) and their opposing charges arc (viz. Volta's element), then a juvenile gas is released which is usually described as hydrogen gas. This evolving hydrogen gas absorbs the oxygen in stilled into the water by the Sun and produces an inner vacuum. In this way a loss of heat follows, because water is actually created out of this material transformation - water is just as unable to grow as any ot her vegetation without the influence of heat. From the combination of (blue) water-gas, oxygen and heat, an inter- mediate substance or gas evolves, normally called either carbonic acid or carbon-dioxide. Since this newly-create d product cools through the binding of heat, then for every 1° C cooled the new gas-produc t loses one 273rd part of its volume. The water becomes free of voids, homogeneous and dense, and in this way extremely mobile (mainly in the flow-axis). The outcome of this is an intensified material meta morphosis and an increased growth of the water, which arises as a result of the previo usly-described transformations (mass- increase). We are here concerned with the fact that the forces arising from this hydrolytic transformation ar e greater than those requ ired to trigger it off. 84 This assertion seems to pre-empt the discov- induced energy losses decrease with increasing ery of superconduction, where resistance- cold. - Ed.

Therefore, regardless of the diminishing gradi- ent, water is able to flow steadily with increasing volume and thus it is able to transport its residual sediment or its digestive waste-matter into the sea. [From TAU No. 145, p.17. - Viktor Schauberger] I could only prove this with the aid of particular water temperatures, because the tractive force increases in the flow-axis wh en organic hydrogen evolves through the proper mixture of temperat ures and appropriate metal facings (with silver as catalyst). Silver bi nds the oxygen gases contained in the water and releases carbonic acid a nd carbon-dioxide from the sediment. This produces an extremely powerful wa ter which is even able to transport stones and iron. 85 85 These egg-shaped energy-enhancing bodies of oppo sitely-charged metals such as zinc (-) may perhaps be alloyed with alternating bands a nd copper (+), or gold (+) and silver (-). - Ed. "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The Dr. Ehrenberger Affair [From TALI No. 142, pp.13-14. - Werner Zimmermann] Is Schauberger to be taken seriously? This crucial question can be answered briefly. Mr Nesper, an engineer, refers to the fact that in Die Wasserwirtschaft the Minister's rive r-engineering adviser, Dr Eh renberger, is supposed to have refuted Schauberger's assertions. However, in his answer Nesper first of all refuted his colleague, engineer Buhi, who in his report made me Schauberger's \"mouthpiece\" and tried to discredit Schauberger's statements as products of fantasy and me as a dreamer. On the other hand, what of the 'Ehrenberger rebuttal'? In Vienna Schauberger showed me a whole sheaf of original letters addressed to the editor of Die Wasserwirtschaft in 1931, in which threat s were made by influ- ential public officials to the effect that they would cancel their subscriptions and ruin Die Wasserwirtschaft, if it ever published a paper or a reply of Schauberger's again. This is the true nature of \"the rebuttal of Schauberger by experts and reputed scientists\" . 86 A second piece of evidence, which demonstrates just how these specialist scientists work, is presently in my hands and I willingly make it available for your perusal. It concerns the great work, The Danube: its Economic and Cultural Function in Central and Eastern Europe, published in October 1932 under the joint auspices of the In ternational Danube Commission and the governments of the Danube States. 87 This well-illustrated magnum opus orig- inally contained a paper by Viktor Schauberger on page 18, entitled \"The problem of regulating the Danube\" The edition was printed and bound at a probable cost of about 100,000 schillings. And what happened? When the experts discovered that the book contai ned a paper by Schauberger, they arranged for the w hole edition to be pulped, reprinted and republished without Schauberger's work, the 100,000 schillings apparently being of no consequence. Are Austria and the Danube States actually swim- ming in money?

However, he was able to secure several dozen of the origi- nal and subsequently destroyed edition, one of which is now in my possession. [From TAU No. 144, p. 27. - Viktor Schauberger] When the findings of Ehrenberger's inve stigation were published, I wanted to refute them factually. Mr Fanto, an eminent businessman and then pub- lisher of Die Wasserwirtschaft, demanded a sum of Sc h 25,000 to publish. Due to the official ban on accep tance of any further articles of mine, he asserted that he would endanger his scientific journal. When I refused to accept his pro position, a hydraulic consultant was called in, according to whose decision a head of department, engineer Rudolf Reich, was supposed to act as mediator. The result of his mediation was a proposal that a certain Dr Luwy and a Dr Schmal should censor my future articles. A few days later the ar ticle I had written was returned to me with the censor's comment that these sh arp attacks had no basis in scientific principle and hence the treatise should not be published. The Federal Chancellor subsequently invited me to have my views on water ennoblement examined by an i ndependent expert. This expert was Prof Dr Mark, who visited me shortly thereafter and studied the so-called water-ennoblement process. At the first trial a petroleum-li ke substance was produced instead of high-grade springw ater, which smelt bad but did not burn. 88 This remarkable abortive experime nt, which in the near future will greatly affect the whole world of te chnology, was the reas on that all rela- 88 Here is an interesting extract from one of nor electrical motive forces could be detected.

So the measurements taken by assistant secretary Ehrenberger could not be disputed , right up to the present day. It should not be necessary to point out that my views on water and its influence have never changed. Then as now I maintain that, as it gradually warms up, water becomes tired and stal e and loses whatever sediment it may carry. In regard to the reduction in flow-velocity associated with a flat- tening of the gradient through the de position of sediment, Ehrenberger was unable to detect any such losses in velocity in the Neuberg flume, because the sand-trap built in front of it prevented the entry of any sediment what- soever. In this flume in which rifli ng ribs had been installed, the forward surge of the logs, studied by Engi neer Karl Heken and Professor Forchheimer, could not be established by Ehrenberger, beca use very particu- lar mixtures of water are necessary. This I demonstrated to the Assistant Secretary in a double-torsional flow pipe before witnesses, where instead of wood, stones were actually used: these travelled down the central flow-axis without touching the sides. [From TAU No. 144, p. 29. - Viktor Schauberger] In relation to the so-called 'Theory of Heat' it must be pointed out that very significant differences of op inion exist: I have a completely different view of the various sources of heat compared to the scientific theories advanced by most researchers. Above all I consider the Sun not to be an incandescent saucepan in the order of 6,000°C, becau se in such a case the oxygen gases evolving on the Earth would have to stream towards this epicentre of com- bustion. No oxygen could therefore be retained in the Earth and in water, whose content of oxygen plays a decisive role in river re gulation. These oxy- gen gases, instilled into the water through the Sun's energies, are the essen- tial precondition for the growth of water and its quantitative increase. By these means it is possible for water, through increasing its mass and weight, to overcome any diminishing bed-gradient in the valley. Only through the growth of water can the enlargement of channel cross-sec- tions everywhere apparent be explai ned, wherein it greatly depends how the hydraulic cross-section is formed at various points in relation to depth. The volume of water discharged into th e sea, as is comm only known, is a multiple of the sum of the discharg e from mountain springs plus the amount of rainfall, wherein it is also to be consider ed that much water evap- orates and infiltrates en route and untold quantities of water are consumed in the growth of the vegetation. Dr Ehrenberger would appear to be tota lly unaware of the fact that in this water-growth the evolving hydrogen play s a major role. Through the inter- play between oxygen and hydrogen, the energies present in stones are"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"released. In this way that substance can first be formed, which we common ly term 'water'. Through the rubbing-toge ther of pebbles, electric sparks are generated, 89 which combine hydrogen and oxygen gases into new water. With this the whole chapter on \"heat\" is closed for, inasmuch as it has a role to play in metabolic proce sses, it will also be dissip ated in the process. As a result the whole water-body remains fresh, cool and full of life without refrig- erators. Through th is process of growth, new water-entities are born, which in today's research centres are not ur-gen erated in the 'original' (form-origi- nating) way and hence cannot be identified. All this was overlooked by Ehrenberger. This explains why, in his calculations, he totally and complete- ly failed to take account of the roughl y 3m/sec (10 ft/sec) movement of the cold volume of water, the constantly changing conditions of absolute and specific weight, the decisive counter-effects of sediment disintegration or, in a word, the atomic transformation here taking place. If stones cannot be pulver ised or if water is unable to obta in its provisions for the journey - the latent kinetic energies inhering in sediment - then it is also no wonder that the river's bread is left lying undigested and the chan- nel-bed silts up. Unfortunately, due to statutory requirements concerning patent applications, it is not possible to disclose more detail and so in this case, the only thing I can do is to take the forever-disputed path of demon- strating the existence of these el emental metabolic phenomena through prac- tical examples. There is hardly a single country in Europe from which representatives from the highest official circles have not already visited me to acquaint themselves with my work. The effect was everywhere the same, namely icy rejection. [From TAU No. 144. - Werner Zimmermann] I sent a copy of TAU 142 to Dr. Ehrenberger at the beginning of February, as I did to all other persons mentioned therein, with a request for corrections where applicable. On 25th February he wrote the letter which I published on p.24 of TAU 144. On 10th March I visited Dr. Ehrenberger at the Research Institute in Vienna and we discusse d the matter for almost two hours. Dr. Ehrenberger asked me, \"Will you also be publishing my letter in Tau verbatim?\". \"Of course\", I replied. He nodded approvingly. All the same I expressed my concern as to the accuracy of his cal culations and indeed the following morning Dr. Ehrenberger telephoned to ask me to delete this section of his letter. I promised that I would do this in TAU 144 and also put the amend- ments   in   hand.

[From TAU 146, p.23 -Dr. Ehrenberger's Missing Section] \"In the calculation of the energy required to heat the water of the Rhine (500m3/s) by 20°C, inaccuracies have crept in. Th e calculated 57,000,000 hp (TAU 142, p7) will only then result, if the heating of 20 °C should take place in one second only. If we now take as an approximation that in order to heat up to this extent, a period from 7am to 5pm (10 hours = 36,000 seconds) is necessary, then the correct quanti- ty of energy amounts to 1,600 hp as comp ared with the 57,000,000 hp value stated by Schauberger. However, since the assu mption of a warming of the water by 20°C is quite improbably high, the actual quant ity of energy will be substantially less.\" [From TAU 148, p26. - Werner Zimmermann] The interpretation of Ehrenberger's is wrong. The 57,000,000 hp are pro- duced because the 500m 3 of water flow through the Rhine cross-section in one second, so that they must be warmed in one second. Expressed differ- ently: every second 500 new cubic metres of water must be warmed; the vol- ume of water which flows down the Rhine from 7am to 5pm, i.e. which flows through the relevant cross-section, is 36,000 x 500m 3 = 18,000,000m 3 .

On the 10th instant you informed Mr Werner Zimmermann, who visited you at your office at your invitation, that Engineer Richard Pruc kner came to you one day in order to tell you that the statements I made in Die Wasserwirtschaft were supposedly untrue. In your article entitled \"Tem perature and the Movement of Water\" "},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"(D M Wassenwirtschaft, No. 9 , 1933) you report on page 7 that these statements were the result of an inquiry addressed to Mr Pruckner.

The reasons why I have been unable to respond to this publication up to now are explained in TAU 142 and 144. With regard to Pruckner's publica- tion, you are to be informed that I ha d no idea that these data would be incorporated in your expose and that these were first made available to me on the 10th instant by Mr Werner Zimmermann. In any case, I only heard about your statements by word of mouth. With respect to Pruckner's article, pl ease be advised that I have in my possession Mr Richard Pruckner's handwritten data, in which this gentle- men detailed for me the canal profile , the normal volum e of water, the length of the Neuwald Pulpm ill canal, the type of re nder, the height of the walls, etc. These data were request ed by Professor Dr Forchheimer, who was so interested in this highly interesting information that he went to Neuwaldegg as fast as possible in order to investigate these phenomena. These investigations factua lly took place, for which Director Priickner's per- mission was first sought, for without it no stranger was permitted entry to the mill premises. Priickner at no time has referred to e ither a positive or a negative temper- ature gradient, but of hi s own free will informed me that in this canal extremely mystifying increases in th e volume of water occurred, which under certain circumstances increased by up to double the normal flow. I expressly asked Mr Priickner whether I could publish this information and whether, with his permission, I could a fford interested parties the possibility of examining these findings more cl osely. This permission was granted. I made the manuscript as well as the printer's proofs available to Mr Priickner and for years I have heard nothing further. Professor Forchheimer asked the then manager, Mr Patta, to confirm the data published in Die Wasserwirtschaft and in the Gastho f zu Frein, wrote down word for word what Patta had to say about these then mysterious events, which in the meantime have long since been explained.

Whatever Mr Zimmermann promis es is also sacred to me and for this reason I will also refrain from p ublishing the mathematically industri- ous but uninspired piece of work know n to me and thus spare you from ridicule before the whole world. Mr Ehrenberger, on many occasions you have done me great harm. I bear neither you nor Mr Pruckner, nor many others who have equal affection for me any resentment, because by your actions you have helped to make the world aware that water is no lifeless substance, but the blood of Mother- Earth, whose innermost nature will never be able to be explained in research laboratories. You have done all humanity and me a great favour. Had you not freely offered me your help, I would have had to find another Ehrenberger. Very soon all the patent arrangements will have been settle d and then, Mr Secretary, the world will discove r all that has happened here.

Viktor Schauberger - Vienna, 12th March 1936."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Learned Scientist and the Star in the Hailstone: A Rare but True Incident [An article in Der Wiener Tag, No. 3381, Sunday, 16th October 1932, page 2, by Viktor Schauberger.] In 1932-33 Viktor Schauberger wrote a spate of about 11 articles concerning a number of subjects related to his theories on water, which appeared mainly in Viennese newspapers and prof essional publications, such Der Wiener Tag, Wiener Neuester Nachrichten, Neue Freie Presse, Architektur und Bautechnik, etc. Some of these articles may well have been reformul ations of the treatises he originally wrote for Die Wasserwirtschaft, for which publication had been refused after Professor Philipp Forchheimer's death. Th e purpose of this entertaining story, one of Viktor's rare excursions into fict ion, was two-fold. On the one hand, seek- ing every available possibility to dissemin ate his theories, he used it to explain the formation of hail; and on the other to ge t his own back in part by poking fun at the thoroughly antagonistic attitude of Dr Ehrenberger, who relentlessly sought to thwart Schauberger's every action and to bring his name into disrepute. Ehrenberger was also the individual princi pally responsible for seeing to it that no further treatises of Viktor Sc hauberger's were published in Die Wasserwirtschaft after Professsor Forchhei mer's death. - [Editor] A fairly long time ago, an absolutely absurd assertion appeared in a Viennese newspaper, namely, 1) that the generally widely held vi ew that the Sun is a molten, incandes- cent fireball with extremel y high temperatures, and 2) that the definition of water by the equally well-k nown formula, H 2 O, are the two greatest scientific misconceptions, the consequences of which will result in not only the economi c collapse of all civilis ed nations, but also the growing unemployment that now affects ever wider circles. A few days after th e article addressing this theme was published, a cham- pion of science appeared in the editorial office of the newspaper. In extreme- ly unflattering phrases, he informed th e editor of the enormity of such irresponsible statements, which were highly conducive to creating confu- sion in the minds of immature y oung people. The scientific advocate demanded an immediate retraction, stat ing that the newspaper had either been sold a pup or had been the butt of a bad joke. The editor refused to accede to this demand, fearing that it would endanger the reputation of his newspaper. "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Because of this, the editor made an effort to persuade the learned scientist to adopt a slightly more objective view of t h e article question. He pointed out that in the main, as history relates, the most important innovations and inventions had been made by outsiders. He also stressed that even if the two assertions by the author of the article were only partially correct, then a change, such as the world had never experienced before, would have to occur in the whole economic situation. The editor vividly described the conseq uences that would inevitably ensue once these scientific miscon ceptions were clarified and recognised for what they were. He further outlined what an end to the appalling unemployment would imply; millions of people would be saved from of starvation and our children, who can only see a dark and dismal future, would now look for- ward to an improvement in this dreadful, daily worsening situation. The editor further tried to show that if these two fundamental tenets of science were actually misconceptions, then not only would the entire educa- tional system have to be changed, but many laws and public institutions too. In such an event all our work in such areas as agriculture, forestry, water and electricity res ources management, together with a whole range of findings in physics, chemistry, botany, geology, etc., would be seen to be founded on false premises - that they were wrong. He then drew attention to the increasingly apparent mistrust in our children and their disenchant- ment with our present methods of working, which had already brought us unemployment and them an absolute hopelessness. He concluded with the comment that even he hims elf, before he was ever aware of the article, had become convinced that this frightful economic collapse was no accident, but could only be the result of serious errors somehow committed by our lead- ing economists. Taking considerable pains, however, the learned scientist eventually suc- ceeded in causing the journalist, who was not well-versed in these matters, to change his mind. It was finally agreed that in the near future the newspa- per would publish an appropriate refutation of these outrageous assertions, to be signed by several scientists. In addition the editor was requested to reject any such artic les in the future. Satisfied with the result , the elderly man now beto ok himself homewards, already formulating in his mind the re buff he was going to prepare for the author of these articles, which were as absurd and they were laughable. In his excitement, the learned scholar failed to notice the approach of a large thunderstorm from which a few hailstones had already fallen on the pave- ment. Suddenly he was struck on the head by a hailsto ne the size of a pigeon's egg and with a painful lump on his head, the old man quickly sought shelter in a nearby doorway. After a short time the thunderstorm passed. With an increasingly severe"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"headache, the scholar continued or hi s homeward way an d upon entering his house, lay down to rest. From his resting place he espied two hailstones which had entered his bedroom through the open window and which, warmed by the rays of sunlight falli ng on the floor, now slowly began to melt, creating a small rivulet of water. As he looked at these two hailstones, larger than hazelnuts, apart from becoming aware for the first time of the danger he had narrowly escaped, his scientific interest was also aroused as he perceived a brilliant, shining crystalline nucleus in the centre of the hailstones, whose or igin, as is well- known, has already occupied a large nu mber of clever minds without suc- cess. Reflecting on this difficult pr oblem, he became aware that his agonising headache had become far wo rse. He suddenly hit upon the obvi- ous idea of using such a hailstone as a poultice to assuage the increasingly acute pain caused by the swelling. The hailstone had hardly been appl ied to the wounded spot before the pain began to ease, an d under its soothing coldne ss, whilst st ill watching the remaining hailstone melt on the fl oor, the man of l earning turned his thoughts once more to the problem of th e mysterious star in the hailstone. The star in the hailstone began to sh ine more and more brilliantly until a bright, cold, brain-penetrating pair of eyes bored into those of the recum- bent scholar. Without taking its eyes of f him, an icy-grey form slowly stood up on the floor, to the amazement of the old man. What at first had appeared to be a puddle on the floor, was actually the cloak in which the increasingly distinct figure was en veloped and which now began to speak as it slowly approached the eminent savant. \"For decades at school you have taught that the Sun is a molten, fiery ball of over 6,000° Celsius. Fo r decades you have descri bed water, the blood of the Earth, with the ridiculous formula, H 2 O. All the while that you have dis- seminated these misconceptions in se veral influential journals, many of your students have themselves become teachers. Some have spread your doctrines even further afield, while othe rs have put them to practical use in accordance with the laws of the land. More and more your theories are tak- ing root in the minds of millions of people, thereby greatly increasing your authority and standing, because these th eories have become the basis of all scientific professions and government intrumentalities. All your fellow human beings are now at their mercy. These theories have spawned a virus that has caused a dying in Nature that is absolutely devastating and with- out parallel. Because of your theories , not only was the happiness of your fellow men slowly but surely destroye d, but with them you have also dis- turbed the whole world, including me in my infinite remoteness and peace. You have forced me to come from th e very ends of the Earth to fall upon your addled pate.\" "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Shaking his head, the eminent scientist observed hi s adversary, who qui- etly continued to speak. \"Were water merely H 2 O as you affirm, then there would be no plants on your Earth, no anim als and hence no human beings. For in reality water is neither H 2 O, which in all organisms is a poison, nor is it contaminated with impurities, as you have so appetisingly suggested. The substances you describe as impurities are actually the substances (carbone s) added to water in conformity with natural law, whic h, raised from the Ea rth by the Sun, cre- ate all life and therefore even you! What right have you to call these vital, life-giving substances - impurities, when you yourself wo uld categorically deny being a product of impurities! In the following I will tell you the truth for the sake of the multitude of poor people and especially for the many innocent children, who even now are forced to accept your false theories and their consequenc es at school. As a result of which they must perish pitifully, because through their work, based as it is on false prem ises, they will inevitably destroy the very precon- ditions for thei r own existence. I will also tell you the truth so that you will be able to solve the problem yourself - a problem whose solution countless people are seeking even today. They will never find it, because they have all been led astray by your misguided theories. In consequence, yo u are now charged with the inalien- able duty, regardless of any repercussions accruing to you personally, to make it known that everything you have so far taught is fallacious and does not conform to th e actual facts. In Nature all life is built of carbones, which consist of plant residues and which, through the action of the oxygen in filtrating into the depths along with the water, are raised from the Earth under the influence of the Sun's heat in order to promote the form ative process mentioned above. This process is to be attributed to the 'breathing' in the so-called living space, which with the help of the Sun and the aid of water, takes place in the fol- lowing simple fashion, which now perhaps may even become clear to you. As is well-known, water is also the carrier of heat. When the Sun rises early in the morning, warmth spreads through the living space, causing the boundary between the atmosphere and th e stratosphere to be displaced upwards. This shift in th e boundary layer only occurs within certain limits, however, which enclose the Earth's su rface both from above and below in the form of two neutral strata. The position of the neutral stratum itself varies quite considerably within the boundary zone and is altered slightly due to fluctuations in temperature be tween night and day, and is displaced to a greater extent by sudden changes in weather and at different times of year. With the movement (advance and retreat) of both neutral strata, the oxygen from above and the suitably preconditioned carbones from below "},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"will be brought into the living space. In precisely this way, as simple as it is sublime, the heart-beat of the Earth is factually activated. This breathing process is absolutely essential lor, because of it, the f ormative substances are made to co-mingle with the water in the atmosphere. Under the influent e ol the alternation of night and day, thes e substances then build the various forms of vegetation, to wh ich in the very widest se nse the Sun also belongs. In passing through the lower neutral stratum, which is characterised by a temperature of +4° Celsius (t his concept, of course, is only to be considered on a strictly relative basis), the strongly carbonated water rising from the depths changes its capacity to dissolve and precipitate matter. Having tra- versed this stratum and arriving in the vegetation zone of the Earth, the water, now under the influence of atmospheric oxygen, must deposit the carbones carried up from be low in the form of sediment. In this process the water eventually becomes deficient in carbones and replaces them with oxy- gen, thereby becoming heavier, and together with the oxygen, sinks back into the depths after th e Sun sets. Now deep in the carbone-sphere and exposed to extremely high temperatures, the oxygen becomes very aggres- sive and actuates the necessary oxidising processes. Under the influence of the Sun, the products of these proce sses will then be ca rried up towards the surface of the Earth by th e water, constantly ennobl ing themselves en route. Similar processes take place in the z one above the upper neutral stratum, but in accordance with the conformities w ith natural law, they occur in an inverted form. For certain reasons, too lengthy to ex plain here, the carbones carried up to great heights by the water-vapour, must constantly be further ennobled (etherealised) until such time as their c onformity with natural law reverses as they pass through the upper neutral st ratum. Here the hydrogen is left behind and the carbones eventually become carrier-less. Having now become carrier-less, the highly ethere alised carbones stream towards the Sun, where due to the effect of extrem ely low temperatures the most refined and ennobled oxygens are concentrated. Here the high-grade carbones will be transmuted into their most highly transformed state - into pure energy. The rays emitted from this epicentr al focus of oxidation undergo a warm oxidation on their return journey, thus participating in the opposite process that occurs on their way towards the Sun. The region from the Sun to the neutral stratum, which is now under th e influence of a negative tempera- ture gradient, encompasses that part of the radiation spectrum in which the rays from the Sun are not immediately perceptible as well as the band- width where these have in part alrea dy been transformed into light rays. The region from the uppe r neutral stratum down to the Earth's surface, which equally exhibits a negative temp erature gradient, is to be described as the region where convers ion into heat takes place. "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"What happened to the hydrogen, which was gra dually left behind en route towards the Sun? Due to the extremely low temperatures at this high altitude, it crystallised into fine ic e-particles, having at tained its highest state of aggregation after surpassing the upper neutral stratum. A process now takes place, whic h is of extreme importance. Each one of these minute particles of ice carries within it a nucleus of very dense oxygen. Due to the absorption of this highly condensed a nd crystallised oxyg en, the fine-ice crystal increases in weight, overcoming the considerable buoyancy active at these high altitudes and the fine-ice body begins to fall according to the law of gravity. When this fine-ice crystal reaches the lower, warmer zones it thaws. Upon passing through the uppe r neutral stratum on its way down, the carrier - hydrogen - alters its state of aggregation and dissolves. Becoming free in the process, the oxyge n now mixes with th e air, simultane- ously reducing its aggressivity and t hus forming a less complex form of oxygen. An analogous process, even if in i nverted compliance with natural law, we also find in the Earth. Accompanyi ng the atmospheric wa ter, not only do the denser forms of oxygen succeed in infiltrating th e Earth, but to a certain extent the very valuable carbones do as well. Without the interaction between these substances, the solution of the salts present in the root-zone and lower down cannot take place correctly. With the aid of these aggressive carbones and oxygenes, the salts in th e ground will now be dissolved and transformed into various forms of nitrogen. These substances alone can be properly processed by the plants. Taking place with the aid of sunlight, this transformation enables the fl uids in the water rising in the vascular bundles be transformed into sugars, starches or cellulose. Some of the refined and ennobled carbones, however, depart in the direction of the Sun, as described earlier. Without these natu ral processes, the buil d-up of any vegetation would be impossible. When these great conformities are disturbed, then a degeneration takes place, which is sy nonymous with the qualitative decline of all forms of vegetation. With a sudden drop in temperature, al so the result of disturbances, some- times the previously described fine-ice cr ystals do not have time to melt and can actually reach the Earth. Due to th e extreme cold they emanate, they gradually become sheathed with a so lid layer of ice on their way down, which even the air's resistance cannot remove. In this manner larger ice- bolides are formed, each of which carries the mysterious star in its centre. One of them wounded you today! As you may recall, Horbiger, that brilliant researcher, also spoke of the enormous degree of coldne ss possessed by th ese granules of fine-ice, which come from the coldest and highest regions of the stratosphere. In any case, even without Horbiger it ought to ha ve been obvious to you that the well-"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"known gas nebulae can only be formed at low temperatures in accordance with the simplest laws of mechanics, and hence in these zones the high tem- peratures you always talk about cannot exist.

Inevitably, therefore, each of these areas of specialisation has produced certain phoney findings, whose application and effect, however, have changed the face of the Earth. In their totality, these effects have become so large that they even affect the natural development of children, forcing their thinking a nd reasoning, even their whole being into unnatural ways. In this process these young, developing human beings are ultimately robbed of the inner connection with Nature they received at birth. Only thus could this dreadful cu rse of decay have engulfed a humani- ty that has set the force of one-sided mechanistic technology agai nst a second stronger, and far more efficient natural force, the organic ecotechnology in Mother-Earth. The only possible outcome of your monstrous aberrations is the enormous misery of va st multitudes, which will gr eet you at ev ery street corner in the most pitiable fashion from the eyes of children, mothers and old men.\" This is where the being's explanations ended. The factual explanations of the learned scientist's adversary, especially the line of argument using the laws concerning the dynamics of ga ses, had irritate d him enormously. Seeing himself slain with his own weapons, his opponent's final rebukes completely robbed him of his compos ure. Furious, he sprang up, only to sink back immediately with a cry of pa in - and woke up. At the point where just a quarter of an hour earlier he had placed the improvised ice-pack, he now felt a burning pain and quickly summoned the doctor. The doctor soon diagnosed a severe co ld in the head an d applied his reme- dies accordingly. Despite the most careful attention, the condition of the patient deteriorated and th e fever became more and mo re intense. The doctor was bewildered by this inexplicable phenomenon. Upon the doctor's repeat- ed questioning, the sick old man related his dream. Sl owly it became clear to the doctor that his treatment had been inappropriate and that he was not here concerned with a chill, but rather with an inflammation of the tissue. While the less complex atmospheric oxygen is able to bring about trans- formations of far-reaching importance when it comes in contact with the ris- ing carbones in the Earth, the oxyge n contained in atmospheric water causes even more far-reaching transfor mations. What dangers, therefore, must the high-grade, aggressive oxygen contained in fine-ice crystals, which already approximates rays of energy, tr igger off in the over-heated blood of an earth-dweller with a headache! "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Impressed by this new understanding, the doctor at once became aware of the enormous danger that now threatened the life of his learned patient. In direct consequence of the release of oxygen from the ice-crystal onto the feverish head of the emin ent scientist lay the dange r of the development of cancerous decay, a phenomenon we are unfortunately already able to observe throughout our forests. The spread of cancerous diseases in trees is the result of carbone-defi cient and oxyg en-enriched water ri sing in the trees' capillaries due to the expos ure of the most shade-de manding species of tim- bers to the light. Having become aggre ssive due to the warming effect of direct solar radiation, the oxygen now promotes the development of swellings through the deco mposition of the tissues. Th is ultimately causes the cancerous tumours that have now spread through almost our entire high forest. Because of the doctor's new per ceptions, his method of treatment changed and the eminent scholar recove red.

Issued 25th August 1935. VIKTOR SCHAUBERGER IN VIENNA THE CONDUCTION OF WATER IN PIPES AND CHANNELS. Application date: 12th August 1931 - Patent applies from: 15th April 1933 The object of the invention is a system of water conduction, which in contrast to smooth-walled conduits, channels, pipelines and the like, promotes an increase in the transported volume of water. In the opinion of the inventor, which forms the basis of his invention, turbulent phenome- na in conventional systems of water con- duction are in part caused by differences in the temperature of the various water-strata, principally because the velocities of the water-masses flowing along the pipe-walls are substantially different from those of the more central strata, causing vortical phe- nomena at their mutual interface. In order to inhibit sedimentation, it is claimed that projecting, turbine-blade shaped elements (guide-vanes) should be incorporated, which ar e inclined from the walls towards the centre. Each of these should be so curved as to direct the flow of water from the periphery towards the middle. It is also to be noted that the inner walls of the pipe are to be provided with raised and curved, rib-like projections in order to impart a rotational motion to the water. The present invention concerns a fur- ther development of these measures with regard to the aims mentioned at the begin- ning. In the attached diagram, various aspects of the invention are depicted. Figure 1 shows an isometric view into the pipe, Figure 2 an oblique view of a single guide-vane, viewed in the opposite direc- tion to the current and Figure 3 the same is viewed at right angles to the direction of flow. Figure 4 depicts how the invention is to be installed in a channel. Figure 5 shows a cross-section of a gu ide-vane incorporat- ing rifle-like fluting aligned to the direc- tion of flow. In pipe 1, a series of guide-vanes 2, 2', 2\" are placed along the curved lines of multiple helical paths 3, 3', 3\". The latter are shown in broken lines. The guide- vanes themselves are curved in the man- ner of ploughshares and project from the walls of the pipe in such a way as to deflect the water towards the centre of the pipe, at the same imparting a rotational motion about the pipe axis. In Figures 2 and 3, which give oblique"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"and side views of a guide-vane, the straight, dotted arrow indicates the direc- tion of flow in a smooth-walled pipe, whereas the curved, solid arrow shows the path of the water filaments deflected by the guide-vane. Similar guide-vanes can also be installed in channels. In this case the guide-vanes are not placed along a helical path, but one directly behind the other and as shown in Figure 4, are arranged symmet- rically on both sides at equal heights and directly opposite each other. The vane in Figure 5 is provided with rifle-like fluting on its guiding surface, through which in the course of such spiral motion, the forward movement of the water will also be given a vertical lift. Pipes incorporating this type of guide- vane are especially suited to the transport of matter heavier than water, such as ores and the like. PATENT CLAIMS 1. The conduction of water in pipes and channels is characterised by the proposed incorporation of turbine-blade-like ele- ments (guide-vanes), projecting inwardly from the surface of the pipe and/or chan- nel walls towards the centre of the same. Each of these elements is so curved as to direct the water from the periphery towards the middle of the conduit, such that in pipes, the guide-vanes are mounted along multiple spiral paths, whereas in channels, these are placed one directly behind the other and arranged symmetri- cally, both opposite each other and at equal heights on each side of the channel. 2. In accordance with Claim 1, the con- duction of water in pipes and channels is further characterised by the proposed incorporation of rifled fluting on the guid- ing surfaces of the vanes, which runs paral- lel to the direction of flow and which directs the flow from the periphery of the pipe towards the centre.

Supplementary Patent to Patent No. 134543 Application date: 2nd November 1932 - Patent applies from: 15th March 1934 Longest possible duration: 14th April 1951 The present invention concerns a further development of the system of water con- duction described in Patent No. 134543, in which turbine-blade shaped elements (guide-vanes) project inwardly from the pipe walls towards the centre of the pipe and which are so curved as to direct the water from the periphery towards the cen- tre, wherein, accordi ng to the original patent, the essential aspect of the inven- tion consists in the positioning of guide- vanes along multiple helical paths. In accordance with Patent No. 134543, the particular form of the guiding surfaces of the vanes is such th at they are provided with rifled fluting, which follows the direction of the current. This invention concerns a further development of these guide-vanes, whose purpose is to enhance the fast forward movement of the central core of water in relation to the flow in the peripheral zones. The normal restrictions to the flow in the peripheral zones leads to turbulent phenomena in the boundary layer between peripheral and core zones and influences the proper formation of the core zone unfavourably. The purpose of the present invention is to divide the peripher- al zone into separate, individual vortical formations, which due to their inner stabil- ity, in a manner of speaking, become stable structures with only a slight tendency to disintegrate. In their aggregate these pro- vide an outer envelope of water, which enhances the forward acceleration of the core-water."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"These vortex-creating elements are twist- ed like wood-shavings, so that two direc- tion-controlling surfaces can be created, in essence according to Figure 1. The purpose of these two surface-elem ents is to impart a torsional motion to the water filaments in the zone of peripheral flow, the direction of which is indicated by the arrow 3, so that a subordinate spiral motion is created within the general spiral motion of the whole water body. In Figure 1, the top view of the invention is shown. Figure 2 shows a per- spective of the invention, viewed in the opposite direction to the flow of the current. Figure 3 shows the shape of the invention when flattened out. The guide-vane 2 is arranged in pipe 1 along multiple helical paths in accordance with Patent No. 143543. When departing from portion 5 of the guide-vane, in each case the water filaments are always imparted a movement directed towards the centre of the pipe cross-section. The flow of water will be enhanced by the ribs 6 and because the ribs converge conically, the water becomes compressed, which should likewise impel the fast-moving transported matter towards the centre. The guide surfaces can also be assembled from separate elements. PATENT CLAIMS 1. In accordance with Patent No. 134543, the conduction of the water is charac- terised by guide-vanes projecting inwardly from the wall-surfaces of the pipe towards the centre, such that, akin to wood-shav- ings, these turbine-blade shaped elements are twisted so as to create two co-acting fin-like surfaces. The fi rst of these surface- elements (upstream element) separates the peripheral zone of the current from the core zone and the second element (down- stream element) additionally imparts a convoluting motion to the separated bun- dle of water filaments due to the twisted shape of the guide-vane surfaces, whereby the peripheral zone will be divided into individual, stable, vortical structures. 2. In accordance with Claim 1, the con- duction of the water is characterised by the fact that, when flattened out, the ribbed guide-vanes possess an almost r homboidal form (Figure 2), whose diagonally opposed obtuse-angled corners are bent over towards the opposite corner (Figure .3).

VIKTOR SCHAUBERGER AT HADERS- DORF-WEIDLINGAU (LOWER AUSTRIA) PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SPRINGWATER-QUALITY DRINKING WATER. Application date: 22nd February 1934 - Patent applies from: 15th January 1935 It is known that mineral water is produced in such a way that sa lts are mixed with any variety of hygienica lly impeccable tap or spring water and that gases are introduced under a pressure of at least 2-3 atmos- pheres, usually under a higher pressure, however. It is also known that to produce sodawater, carbon-dioxide is introduced into the water under a mechanical pressure of about 12 atmospheres, creating a corre- sponding concentration of so-called free carbonic acid, which appears to be bound in the water by mechanical means only. A similar process is involved in the manufac- ture of \"fizzy pop\"."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"In the artificial manufacture of mineral water, carbon-dioxide is similarly intro- duced under greater or lesser pressure, which in any event, however, is greater than 1 atmosphere, wherein a sufficient quantity of certain salts is admixed as the taste of the mineral water demands. A fur- ther well-known method of producing effervescent drinks consists in dissolving any easily soluble carbonate (sodium bicarbonate for example) and adding weak acids (such as tartaric or citric acid), through which free carbonic acid is similarly evolved, which is the cause of the prickly taste of the drink thus created. The present case, however, concerns the production of water of a kind in which car- bon-dioxide is not merely concentrated in unbound form, but is -contained in bound form, and in every respect is similar to good, high-grade springwater, wherein the manufacturing process emu- lates the processes in Nature as far as possible. Sterilised water flows down pipe m under a cold, mercury-vapour lamp and mixes with the salt solution coming from duct l . In vessel C the salts are actually dis- solved and well stirred by mixer g. The quantity and type of salt is naturally dependent on the composition of the par- ent water, which in most cases will be any variety of surface wate r exhibiting certain permanent degrees of hardness. On the other hand, through the addition of salts, the hardness of the water to be produced should not be caused to exceed 12 degrees, otherwise the product would be difficult for industry to use. For every 10 litres of any average quality parent water, 1 litre of salt solution is prepared in which about 0.02g sodium-chloride, 0.02g magnesium- sulphate, 0.02g sodium-biphosphate, 0.008g potassium-nitrate and 0.2g calcium- oxide are dissolved. The type and quantity of these salts are the result of several hun- dred experiments. Since in the beginning the calcium-oxide is only partially dis- solved in the water, and on the other hand, the evolving calcium hydrate is sensitive to atmospheric carbon-dioxide, the vessel is sealed against light and air. In order to maintain a constant rate of discharge from vessel C, it is placed under a constant pres- sure of 0.1 atmospheres = 1 water-column metre. The concentrated salt solution is continuously added to the water in pipe m drop by drop and the mixture of both flu- ids flows into the atomising unit D, where it is sprayed into the interior of the vessel through the small holes n in the pipe, whereas the already previously prepared carbonated water is sprayed outwards from atomising pipe k. The droplets of both types of water then precipitate, mixing together drop by drop en route in the same way that in Nature every drop on its way down into the Earth first dissolves salts and absorbs gases. This quantity of water now flows into unit E containing tulip-like glass bulbs and always rises up in the outer glass tulip, subsequently to be made to descend in the inner glass tulip, in order to rise further through the innermost riser pipe into the next higher outer tulip. During this process the water therefore follows a meander-like path en route to the process- es described later. The gas, that is to say, predominantly the carbon-dioxide, always accumulates in the upper part of the tulip and once the pressure has risen sufficient- ly, will then be continuously injected into the path of the rising water in the inner- most riser pipe via the tube r, in which the very finest jets have been incorporated, so that any carbon-dioxide not previously bound, will be forced to bind itself with the water. On the axis of this component of the apparatus, an alternating series of gold and silver laminate s are attached, but which are insulated from each other. A cer- tain potential is created between both met- als, giving rise to the weak ionisation of the water. Further along its path, the water enters the main mixer F. This consists of an exter- nally thermally-insulated cylindrical metal vessel, silver-plated on the inside, incorpo-"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"rating an Archimedes screw-like auger, which rotates in the opposite direction to that in which the spiral i s generated. In addition, cooling coils are affixed to the surface of the spiral bl ades, which cool the water to +4°C, whose ennobling process begins at 17°C. The effect of this drop in temperature is of integral significance to the actual process of ennoblement. By being cooled, on the one hand the water's capacity to absorb gases will be increased and on the other, the substantial binding of free carbon-dioxide (without application of pressure) in such ample measure is only possible through cooling. The Ca(HCO 3 ) 2 (calcium-bicarbonate) is an extremely labile compound, which is responsible for the concentration of the so-called dissolved carbon-dioxide (bound carbonic acid) in the water. However, the substantial binding of Ca(HCO 3 ) 2 and with it the proper and effective binding of the carbon-dioxide (carbonic acid) to the water is only possi- ble with the right degree of simultaneous cooling. In this connection, the starting temperature of the water should not exceed about 20°C and the end tempera- ture must approximate +4°C. Attention should also be paid to the rate of cooling and if this takes place too rapidly, suffi- cient binding will likewise not be achieved. Before leaving this vessel, the water must again pass by gold and silver laminates, whose function has previously been described, finally reaching the stor- age vessel I, which is divided into two chambers G & H. The water only reaches chamber H by overflowing from chamber G, for the following reasons. With the treatment of the water in the way out- lined above, certain delayed reactions occur. Only when these have ceased can the water be described as completely ready to drink. It is also necessary that this process should take place entirely in the dark (insulated from light), since experiments have shown that similar processes of ennoblement under the influ- ence of light yield a more inferior water. PATENT CLAIMS 1. The process for the production of springwater-like drinking water is charac- terised by the mixing of sterile water, alloyed with small quantities of various salts in a finely atomised state, with equal- ly finely atomised carbonated water, In which the mixed product is cooled on an extended route comprised of cross-section al profiles of various shapes and forms. 2. In accordance with Claim 1, the atomisation of the salt-alloyed water is effected by means of a perforated systems of tubes, through which it is expressed into a sealed, dark, air-tight vessel and as it falls towards the bottom of the vessel, mixes drop by drop with similarly atom- ised carbonated water, also issuing from perforated tubes. 3. In relation to Claims 1 and 2, the mixed product flows through an appara- tus isolated from light and air, in which the water describes a meander-like course and is alternately conduct ed through narrow and broad cross-sections, whereby the car- bon-dioxide precipitated at the broader cross-section is re-inject ed into the water at the narrower section. 4. In relation to Claims 1 to 3 of the process, the water is further conducted through a mixing unit in which it must describe a screw-like path, wherein the screw turns in the opposite direction to the turn of the thread and on whose surfaces cooling coils are attached for the purpose of raising the water's capacity to absorb gas as it is cooled towards the anomaly point of +4°C. 5. In order to carry out the process, cer- tain equipment is necessary according to claims 3 & 4, wherein it is hereby stated, that an alternating series of gold and silver laminates are affixed at well-insulated positions.

Application date: 21st December 1926 - Patent applies from: 15th January 1930 The object of the invention is a hydro-elec- tric device, which exploits the kinetic ener- gy of a water jet for the purposes of generating electricity. The invention is characterised by a cone-shaped rotor, whose apex points towards the outlet opening, and rotates about an axis common to both rotor and water jet. The outer face of the cone is formed of upward-facing, concave, corkscrew-like blades. In this way the water-jet is split up and deflected from its path and imparts its full force to the rotor, so that, with the appropriate proportions between the height of the cone and the width of its base, and a suitable pitch of the blades, the size of which is dependent on the velocity of the impacting water-jet, the water flows from the machine quietly without creating spray. An example of the arrangement of the invention is schematically depicted in the diagram. The rotor, whose axle 1 is parallel and common to the axis of the jet exiting from the jet-pipe 2, is formed of corkscrew-like blades 3. The ends 4 of the blades 3 are curved upwards slightly towards the impacting water-jet so as to deflect the jet and to effect the greatest possible transfer of its kinetic energy to the rotor. In the jet-pipe 2 screw-like ribs 5 are incorporated, which, according to observations, increase the velocity of the exiting water-jet and th e efficiency of the device. PATENT CLAIMS 1. The jet-turbine is characterised by a cone-shaped rotor positioned in the axis of the water-jet, by means of which the water-jet is split up. Corkscrew-like blades (5) are incorporated around the cone's periphery (7). 2. In accordance with Cl aim 1, the jet- turbine is further characterised by a jet- pipe (2) incorporating rifling ribs (5), which impart a spin to the rotor in the direction of its rotation.

VIKTOR SCHAUBERGER IN PURKERSDORF, LOWER AUSTRIA. A DEVICE FOR TORRENT CONFINEMENT AND RIVER REGULATION. Application date: 31st January 1927 - Patent applies from: 15th January 1929 The object of the invention is a device for the purposes of torrent confinement and river regulation, by means of which the velocity of the water can be braked in such a way that the transported sediment can engender no hazardous, destructive effects and the move- ment of the water can be so influenced as to displace the theoretical flow-axis towards the middle of the channel. The attached drawing depicts the object of the invention schematically and Figure 1 shows the installation of such a braking, flow-guiding device in the form of brake- groins installed at right angles to the direc- tion of flow. The brake-groins 1 are desirably made out of reinforced concrete and are anchored i nto the ground by the downwardly projecting stumps 2 shown in Figure 1, to prevent their being dislodged by the onflowing water. In an upstream direction these brake-groins incorporate a concave, fluted wedge-shape (Figure 5 ), onto which the water flows and by means of which it is lifted and directed towards the centre of the channel, thus dissi- pating a great deal of its momentum and rendering it incapable of transporting larger rocks or stones. These brake-groins are installed at greater or lesser intervals in the stream-bed, accord- ing to the steepness of the gradient. In order to displace the theoretical flow-axis towards the centre of the channel during the course Figs. 33 & 34: Note: Figures referred to in patent text relate to those indicated in fig. 33 of this book, Fig. 34 is the translator's interpretation of the above patent description, the latter seeming to be a t variance with the patent diagram (fig. 33).

In Figure 2 the brake-groins are indicated by the number 3, whereas the deposition of sediment occurring on the opposite side of the channel is indicated by the number 4. The flow-axis desirabl y to be displaced by these installations is shown by the arrowed line indicated by the number 5. Figure 3 depicts the device at a larger scale and Figure 4 shows the cross-section through the same. The essential shape of the device is triangular (Figures 4 and 5) and its active surface rises towards the riverbank and gradually projects towards the centre of the channel. The function of these devices is particularly apparent in Figure 4 in which the solid line 6 shows the bed-profile prior to the installation of the device and the dotted line 6' indicates the profile ultimately produced. Between these braking-groins 3 the transported sediment is deposited, creat- ing a zone of dead-water near the bank, which serves as a buffer and keeps the flowing water-body away from the bank, thus preventing the bank from being undermined (Figure 3). In Figure 3 the solid line 5 shows the flow-axis before installa- tion of the devices and the dotted line 5' shows the displaced flow-axis due to the action of the invention. PATENT CLAIMS 1. The device for torrent confinement and river regulation is characterised by the concave fluting on the upstream side so that the on-flowing water is deflected upwards and backwards, or towards the middle of the channel. 2. In accordance with Claim 1 the device is further characteris ed by its triangular shape, which projects from the bank at right-angles to the current flow. Description Of Patent No. 136214 AUSTRIAN PATENT OFFICE DESCRIPTION OF PATENT No. 136214 Class 84. Issued 10th January 1934. VIKTOR SCHAUBERGER IN PURKERSDORF NEAR VIENNA CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT FOR REGULATING THE DISCHARGE FROM DAMS AND FOR INCREASING THE STABILITY OF DAM-WALLS Application date: 23rd April 1930 - Patent applies from: 15th August 1933 The invention concerns the design of plant and associated equipment for regulating the downstream channel of reservoirs and for increasing the structural stability of their barrage-walls. In particular, the invention consists in the fact that a mixture of heavy- and light-w ater, which is suited to and dependent upon the external tem- perature, can be conducted from the reser- voir into the drainage channel automatically and in such away that, as circumstances demand, the heavy-water to be discharged into the drainage channel can be diverted to cool the valley-side of the barrage-wall by over-trickling it with heavy-water. It has become evident that in all hydraulic practices app lied to the drainage of water in channels, an important factor has been disregarded, namely the temper- ature of the water in relation to ground- and air-temperatures, as well as the differ- ences in temperature in the flowing water itself. Furthemore it has also been deter- mined that the existing and constantly changing differences in temperature influ- ence the movement of the water decisively. Inasmuch as the natural channel is subdi- vided by artificial constructions, such as dams, weirs and the like, and the dis- charge therefrom is either via bottom- sluices (which discharge heavy-water with a temperature of about +4°C only) or via the spillway (whereby the downstream"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"channel is supplied with the currently highest temperature water), disturbances develop in the downstream channel, which in particular give rise to curves in the channel and to the destruction of the riverbank. However, if water of a tempera- ture corresponding to the ambient external temperature, i.e. correctly tempered water, is discharged into a given channel, then as circumstances dictate, the water-masses can either be braked and their sweeping- force reduced or conversely, they can be accelerated and their sweeping-force increased. Instead of regulating the chan- nel with bank-protecting structures, whose effect is only local, it is therefore possible to bring about the disturbance-free drainage of the water-masses solely through the regulation of the right water- temperatures; that is, through the automat- ic establishment of an enduring state of equilibrium in the water itself. Widening of the channel through the deposition of sediment, or the ejection of the same (grav- el banks), and fissures in the riverbank, especially at the bends, can be prevented by properly designed and equipped dams, and incorrect drainage conditions correct- ed. Through the appropriate adjustment of the mechanisms inco rporated in these dams for controlling the discharge of light- or heavy-water, the temperature gradient corresponding to the ambient external temperature can be re-established and in this way the danger of flooding in particu- lar can be almost completely averted. Concurrently with the regulation of the drainage channel, the stability of the struc- ture required for this purpose, namely the specially designed barrage-wall of the reservoir, can also be increased in a man- ner whereby the pores in the wall-struc- ture are sealed through the cooling of the water-particles infiltrating into the wall from the reservoir, thereby removing the cause of the wall's destruction. With a reduction in temperature, the light-water infiltrating into the wall-pores loses its ability to transport and dissolve salts and other substances, until at a temperature of +4 o C it reaches the condition where its dis- solving power is at minimum and the fil- ter-action of the wall is greatest, through the cooling of the valley-side of t h e bar- rage-wall by overtrickling it with +4 o C heavy-water, the light-water infiltrating from the reservoir is cooled and precip- tates its dissolved substances into the pores, thereby sealing them. The water- tight sealing of the wall-pores is achieved within a few weeks, thus making any fur- ther safety precautions against the destruc- tion of the wall superfluous. Should the aforementioned cooling of the valley-side of the wall be omitted, then the light-water infiltrating into the wall from the reservoir will be warmed from the valley-side of the wall, in particular by solar irradiation, thereby gaining in dissolving power vis-a- vis the solid particles of the construction material. The pores will be leached out. With increasing en largement of the pores, the explosive action of frost will also be greater. Fissures will develop in the wall, which permit the entry of more water not only as a result of hydrostatic pressure, but also due to current-pressure, until such time as the structure of the wall, particu- larly at the height of the normal water- level, is completely destroyed. The diagram depicts an example of the design of the installation, namely the bar- rage-wall of a dam. Fig. 1 shows a cross-sec- tion and Fig. 2 the plan, whereas Fig. 3 is a detail showing the discharge control-mech- anism in section. For the purposes of regulating the amounts of cold heavy-water and warm light-water, sluices O in the barrage-wall K of the reservoir B are incorporated on both sides of the same, whose sluice-gates T are operated by a temperature-controlled floating body G. The rising pipes W con- nect the sluices O to the main spillway K 1 of the barrage-wall. Diverter-pipes U 1 , U 2 and U 3 are located at various heights, which branch off from the rising pipes W and are controlled as required by stop valves V 1 and V 2 These diverter-pipes lead to the valley-side of the barrage-wall K"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"and discharge into their respective, hori- zontal troughs. At the base of the valley- side of the barrage-wall K, an upwardly curved structure K 3 is incorporated for the purposes of creating vortices and for the better mixture of the water flowing over the wall. The blades of the sluice-gates T rest on a sill recessed into the bottom of sluices O and their water-tight closure is effected by pressure-alleviating rollers set in vertical grooves. By means of a connecting-rod F, situated in a shaft in the side-wall H, the sluice-gate T is attached to the floating body G, which can be shaped like a div- ing-bell for example. In the side-wall H at various heights above sluice O, pipe- shaped openings A are incorporated, which communicate between th e shaft in which diving-bell G floats and the open water of the reservoir. When sluice-gate T is opened, communication is also achieved between riser-pipe W and the reservoir through the filling of the riser-pipe, which relieves sluice-gate T from one-sided pressure, thus ensuring its most friction-free operation. Being constructed preferably of timber, sluice-gate T can therefore be precisely adjusted to the carryi ng capacity of diving- bell G, so that its free movement under all water conditions is assured. Diving-bell G, whose position on connecting-rod F is vari- able, can therefore be set to float at any desired height. In the lid of diving-bell G there is a closable air-vent P, through which, if opened, compressed air within the diving-bell can escape, causing sluice-gate T to shut immediately. By means of a verti- cally calibrated pipe R, open at both ends, the water-level inside the diving-bell can be set to any desired height depending on the depth at which the bottom of pipe R is fixed. When diving-bell G is completely submerged with no internal air-cushion, it can be raised through the supply of com- pressed air via pipe R by shutting air-vent P, thereby enabling sluice-gate T to be raised. During normal operation the air- cushion enclosed within the diving-bell is in close contact with the atmosphere via the diving-bell wall, so that, particularly in the case of metal walls, the external tempera- ture will exert an influence on the volume of the air-cushion. Depending on the exter- nal-temperature-related increase or decrease in the volume of the air-cushion in diving-bell G, sluice-gate T will either be raised or lowered. The amount of heavy- water conducted to the valley-side of the dam-wall via sluices O , rising-pipes W and diverter pipes U 1 , U 2 and U 3 , and dis- charged into the channel, will therefore vary according to the ex ternal temperature. The light-waterflows over a special spill- way-structure M above the top of the dam- wall and down into the channel. The thorough mixture of heavy- and light-water will not only be facilitated through the upwardly curving structure K 3 at the base of the valley-side of the bar- rage-wall, but also through the conduction of heavy-water via the horizontal diverter- pipes U 1 , U 2 and U 3 and their respective troughs into the path of the vertically falling light-water; their intimate mixture being achieved by means of the vortices created artificially in this way. As each indi- vidual diving-bell G is irradiated by the sun, the respective sluice-gate T will be fur- ther raised and in this way a greater per- centage of heavy-water will be added to the light-water flowing over the top of the bar- rage-wall at M, whereas with cool external temperatures, sluice-gates T will be nearly or completely closed, allowing only warm light-water to overflow into the channel. The heavy-water conducted to the top of the dam wall at spillway K 1 for purpos- es of better mixture can simultaneously be employed to increase the stability of the barrage-wall. Once construction of bar- rage-wall K has been completed, the lower, valley-side portion of the barrage-wall K will be over-trickled with heavy-water exclusively by means of diverter-pipe U 2 for instance, for which purpose diving-bell G will be so adjusted that the sluice-gates T will remain open constantly. At this junc- ture an overflow over the top of the dam is not appropriate and the heavy-water sup-"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"ply will be conducted directly to the chan- nel via sluice O. The heavy-water over- trickling the valley-side of the barrage-wall now cools the wall from the outside to such an extent that the light- water percolating into the wall-pores from the reservoir deposits its dissolved sub- stances and seals them off. After the lower portion of the barrage-wall has been sealed, the heavy-water can be conducted to the upper portion of the barrage-wall via diverter-pipes U3, which can then be sealed in a similar fashion. This sealing process, during which the wall-pores become water-tight, may require several weeks, depending on the quality of the construction material. Once completed, no further dangers are to be feared, even dur- ing normal operations. After the wall has been sealed, the special spillway-structure M, which need only be made of steel and placed atop the wall temporarily, can also be removed so that the light-water, instead of discharging over spillway M, will over- trickle the top of the dam-wall K 1 , thereby preserving and protecting the wall-struc- ture on the valley-side.

LIGHT-INDUCED GROWTH: The rapid and unhealthy increase in the girth of shade-demanding species of timber when over-exposed to light, radiation and heart from the Sun. NASCENT SPRING WATER: Immature water within the central stratum of the"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"groundwater, having a temperature of about +4° Celsius. NATURALESQUE: Refers to artificially contrived processes or mechanical devices that conform to or emulate Nature's laws, or operate in a naturally correct way. POTENTIAL ENERGY: Stored energy or energy that as yet is unmanifested as dynamic or kinetic energy. QUALIGENS: The ethericities responsible for the enhancement of quality and increase in quality matter. SEEPAGE SPRING: A spring that is formed when percolating groundwater encounters an impervious stratum and drains away over the stratum surface under the influence of gravity towards the point of egress. The temperature of such springs generally conforms to the ambient ground temperature. TEMPERAMENT: In Viktor Schauberger's terminology, this refers to the behaviour, character, gender and intrinsic properties, sometimes temperature-induced, of various immaterial and other energies, such as elec- tricism, biomagnetism, gravity and levity as well as the media of earth, air and water. TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS: In terms of Viktor Schauberger's concepts, tempera- ture gradients are principally related to the direction of movement of temperature within and between the respective temper- atures of the ground, water and atmos- phere, which can either take a positive or negative form. A positive temperature gradient occurs when the direction of tem- perature movement is towards the anom- aly point of water, i.e. towards +4 o C. A negative temperature gradient occurs when the direction of temperature move- ment is either upwards or downwards from +4°Celsius. TRACTIVE FORCE: The force that acts to 'shear off' or to dredge and dislodge sedi- ment. (See Footnote 3, p.16) TRIBO-LUMINESCENCE: An internal glow or luminescence produced when two or more crystalline ro cks of similar compo- sition are rubbed hard together or struck against one another and is attributed to the energy given off by the electrons contained the rocks as they return from a pressure- induced, excited state to their rest orbits As a phenomenon it can occur both in air and under water. (See Footnote 18, p.39) TURBIDITY: A measure of the opaque- ness, cloudiness or muddiness of water due its content of suspended matter. VALENCY: Highly polarised, pregnant state. WATER MASSES: Both the body of water generally, but also the various swirling volumes and filaments of water of differ- ent temperatures, densities and energetic content whose values are prescribed by the inner densities of the water. WHORL-PIPES: Pipes, principally made of copper or its alloys, having a spiral con- figuration akin to that of a Kudu antelope, through which the transported medium is caused to move centripetally and vortical- ly in a double spiral motion."}]
