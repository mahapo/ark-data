Thus we have established the fact that so far technology has only partly recognized the significance of Nature's polarity. Only after having explored the above mentioned deeper psycho- logical factors do we begin to understand why it has seemed pre- ferable to utilize the pressure component. This totally one- sided attitude in regard to the production of energy is res- ponsible for the fact that the essenti al balance of the bipolar structure of the basic natural elements has been severly upset and all life on earth put in gravest danger of extinction. All life has its secret in dipolarity. Without opposite poles there can be no attra ction, and no rep ulsion. Without attraction and repulsion there can be no movement, and without the latter, no life. Light calls for darkness, because without darkness it would have no meaning. The alt ernation of warmth and cold, of day and night is also of greatest importance to our planet. While one side of the earth is co oling, its other side is getting warme r. These temperature differences produce a constant flux which results in a spiral rotation just as it happens with hot and cold air fronts whose meeting results in cyclones and hurricane s. There are even differences in the earth's weight, because on its warm side the weight increase is absolute and on the cold side s pecific. This, together with the magnetic forces, produces a declining rotational movement. The temperature differences exert a constant pressure which sets the masses in motion as it seeks compensation.

This observation, though of the greatest importance, has failed to attract the attention it deserves. All that lives (at this level of consciousness or being) moves between two op- posites, between two poles -- he nce dipolarity -- spiralling up- wards toward enlightenment and purification, or downwards through deterioration and degeneration toward ruin. This depends on whether the driving force is cen tripetal (that is, concentric -- toward the center) or centrifugal (that is, excentric -- toward the outside). The excentric or cenrifugal force leads to de- struction, the concentric or centripetal force leads to growth and enrichment. This is equally true of material and of spiri- tual matters. BALANCING NEGATIVE WITH POSITIVE In the Tabula Smaragdi na, the oldest of Arian Writs, we find the following significant words cut in the emerald: \"Com- bine the heavenly with the earthly in accordance with th e Laws of Nature, and health and happiness shall be yours as long as you live.\" Only the finest elements shoul d be mated and blended if one wishes to obtain each time a finer and higher product. To mate, means to unite and to st imulate two opposites, the posi- tive and the negative. The ne gative attracts the positive and the latter is drawn to the negative. Sunlight, which is posi- tive, fertilizes the negative grain seed in the womb of the earth. A constant exchange of emissions between the positive atmosphere and the negative geo sphere brings the seed to life. In this case it can be truly sa id: \"She partly drew him down, he partly let himself sink.\" (Goethe: The Ballad of the Fi- sherman) Union between the offspring of the earth and the descen- dants of the sun gives rise to life in the phys ical realm which is directed by the Etheric forces. The latter, on the other hand, have their own higher counterpart. The negati ve offspring of the earth capture the positive descendants of the sun and this pro- duces a constant automatic movement. In the spring of the year, when the temperature and light conditions are relatively favor- able, the positive ra ys of the sun (light) induce germination in the negative grains or seed. Therefore, to combine, means to stimulate and prod uce various gradie nts of potential. This in turn produces movement which is the very basis of life, so that everything is in constant flux (panta rhei). Although the world is animated by a single universal force, this force can be div ided into two contra sting elements — the pressure component, and the suction component. In this case, Nature's dipolarity expresses it self in the form of two differ- - 2 -"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"exit types of mot ion. Each of t hese types manifests itself through certain specific phenomena and represents one of the two components of the force which animates and activates the whole universe. The secret of the normal and good life con- sists of achieving the proper balance or blend of these two components. (see \"Tabula Smaragdina\". Th is is pure Cabala. All occult science, East and West, bases itself on this prin- ciple, Chokmah and Bina , Osiris and Isis, Or pheus and Eurydice. The whirling Hooked Cross, the Swastika, is the symbol. Re- volving counte r-clockwise, centrifuga l, it is negative. Re- volving clockwise, centripetal, it is positive.) USE CENTRIPETENCE TO OVERCOME GRAVITY The pressure component leads to Centrifugence, friction, increased heat and gravitation; while the suction compoment leads to Centripetence, cooling, absence of friction and levi- tation -- which makes it possible to ove rcome gravity. While friction may produce even white heat, fire. Centripetence pro- duces a temperature drop which may reach what is known as the State of Anomaly which, in the case of water, +4° Centigrade. However, this is possible only if one U6es Schauberger's suc- tion spiral, a device which, on the whole, is still unknown. Each living entity has its specific and characteristic point of Anomaly. This should be understood as the temperature or fever-less condition, that i s, the optimum degree of warmth required by its species to develop and proliferate. Until now technology has recognized only one type of motion, the type which raises the tempe rature through friction and pres- sure. Even ancient tribes knew that fire coul d be produced by rubbing together wood or stones; but it too k Viktor Schauberger to discover a new type of motion producing not heat, but a tem- perature drop, reaching at times the point of Anomaly. This can be accomplished by tightly winding or coiling either air or water through a spiral cuvred channel of special design. In this process the medium — air or water — is drawn al- most without friction toward a central point, condensed in a special manner and at the same time coole d. A biological vacuum (negative pressure) is created which, on its part, augments the suction acting on air or wate r. Until now this possibility has been overlooked in technology, and yet it offers totally new perspectives in regard to energy p roduction. Friction cre- ates in a machine conditions comparable to fever, conditions which cannot be normal, since they tax materials excessively and burn them out. People and animals do not develop fever because of work. They may get hot but their blo od temperature remains relatively constant. Normal conditions in ma chinery can be achieved by or through implosion and impansion wit h the best possible results in regard to the preservation of materials. It would seem ob- - 3 -"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"vious that man's duty is not to waste and squander as quickly as he can the resources of the earth, but to preserve and conserve them. Machinery design , therefore, should avoid all material waste and should ensu re at the same time d urability. Our un- scrupulous modern technology and ceonomy, unfor tunately, have been moving in the opposite direction. THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO GO The two types of motion which nature employs give rise to the following phenomena: (a) \"Centrifugence\" - resistance to friction pressure temperature rise biological deterioration (b) \"Centripetence\" - absence of friction suction temperature drop biological improvement \"Centrifugence\", which is a sc attering of force, is slowed down by natural causes, because the resistance it encounters . grows as the square of its veloc ity, following the well known formula W=MV 2 . Were it not for this fact, matter would risk being destroyed, or would be in danger of being broken up into atoms. The opposite is true of \"Centripe tence\". Its effec- tive force undergoes no d eceleration, since the re is virtually no friction, and grows, instead, as the square of its velocity. Centripetence contracts, conse rves, condenses and therefore benefits life. It attracts and absorbs without producing pressure. It is obvious therefore that as a result of the natural laws the effective power of centrifugal motion is n ever as great as that of centripetal motio n, the first being destructive, the second constructive. Were the destructive force more powerful than the constructive force the universe would not exist. (The Christ is Centripetence. The Anti-Christ is Centrifugence.) Unfortunately our whole technology has comm itted the error of choosing the destructive force as a means to it s own ends, and this tragic choice of the mode of propuls ion and motivation, having completely disr upted the ratios and balance of nature, has brought it to a blind alley. Ins tead of applying by pre- ference, as nature d oes, centripetence whi ch permits producing energy almost at no cost, it has done the opposite. This has resulted in an over consumption of raw materials, in an explo- sion and exploitation of natural resources, until now the very destruction of atoms has been reached. Centrifugence increa ses pressure and heat. Centripetence has a cooling effect and generates condensing reactive forces. It never cools beyo nd the point of anomaly. We know that while moderate chilling and moderate c old conserves, refreshes and pre- - 4 -"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"serves, rising temperatures lead to heat, putrefaction and com- bustion. THE CABALISTIC PRINCIPLE OF BALANCE In order to subsist, life must have both heat and cold. Exposure to excessive heat and light produces cancer in organic tissues (but living orga nic tissues); in dead organic tissues it produces rapid putrefaction and decay. Cold, on the other hand, preserves, consolidates and arrests disintegration. For this reason, food can be preserved only by applying cold. With the temperature at +4° C. Thus cold is as important to life as warmth. Man must strike the gold en mean between the two in order to real- ize the best conditions for his development and propagation. All mechanical movement is t he outcome of attraction and repulsion. However, the domi nant factor regulating motion is not the pressure component, as assumed by our whole fire techno-- logy of steam pressure, hyd raulics, electrical powe r, gas pres- sure, atomic fission, etc., but the suction component. So far, however, this component has been completely neglected by our tech-nology and overloo ked in mechanics. The tragic end of our civilization and culture is therefore inevitable, unless the new type of energy which can be produced by means of s uction can be utilized in the form of implosion and imp ansion for industrial purposes. It its second and higher phases, Centripetence generates magnetic forces, namel y what is known as diamagnetism -- a special type of vital energy lacking which no creature can sur- vive. As we see, there is one type of motion which determines a temperature rise, another whi ch determines temperature drop. Now then, these systems of motion should be organized and ad- justed in such a way as to have the constructive forces re- presenting always over 50% of the total. Wh en this ratio is exceeded, which of course should never be allowed to happen, synthesis becomes too rapid and there is ma ximum activation of the so-called etheric form of carbons, a maximum which equals approximately 94%, plus 4 to 6% condensed oxygen. Conversely, by destroying these products of synthesis one obtains a product containing only 4 to 5% high-grade substan ces and an excess of accumulated solar energy wastes, that is, complete peroxidation. (See also effects of radi oactivity). A per oxidation of energy concentrates leads to a hyperacidity of the blood and lymph due to a deficiency of high-grade substances, then to cell damage, cell destruction and cancer. Therefore, for the sake of his well-being, man should be careful not to resort to fire technology alone; that is, to that type of motion which produces fr iction and Centri fugence. In order to create for himself healthy, normal conditions, to get the best out of life — or make his life bett er, he should ap- - 5 -"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ply rather the planetary type of motion which is not Centri- fugal, excentric, but primarily Centripetal, that is, concentric. In nature there is definitely no such thing as homogeneous motion. The predomi nantly Centripetal t ype of motion which pro- duces diamagnetic levitation is based exclusively on the spiral. Only this motion permits the pl anets to orbit free ly around the sun following their predetermined paths. This could not be the result of gravitation alone, but also of their own powers of levi- tation. Only the proper balance between gravitation and levita- tion, between the attractive and th e pressure forces makes it possible for the individual planets and the various solar systems to move along their courses, as parts of Spiral Nebulae. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SPIRAL Without the Spiral the re can be no le vitation. This repre- sents the opposite of gravitation -- an observation which has yet to be made by orthodox scien ce. All we know about levitation -- that is, the art of overcoming gravity -- has come down to us only through the Secret Teachings (for instance the Whirling Der- vishes of the Middle E ast). The geometrical spiral is the basis of all planetary movement. It rep resents the moti on which is employed by nature as a means of ascent and pur ification. In 1919 it was found by Vikt or Schauberger that the spiral can be adapted to technical uses in the form of a suction impeller. Today only its opposite, the pressure impeller, is being used; while the suction impeller is still unknown. Centripetal motion, in contrast to Centrif ugal motion, is not circular but spiral. All t hat moves in a circle remains in one place both spatially and bi ologically and b ecomes arrested in its development. That which is arrested in its development is forced to regress. There is no standstill in nature; in the universe there is only advance and retreat. Technologists are s till quite unaware that the only path to growth and rise is the spiral. The c onsequences of this seemingly harmless oversight are nevertheless catastrophic. Centrifugence produces friction and fricti on produces fire. It eliminates water and robs the soil of its fe rtility. The soil, only temporarily stimulated by art ificial fertilizers, is hastened in its truly cancerous process and becomes gradually barren. One of the economic consequences of this oversight is the looting of natural resources and their total depletion, which brings a bout political un rest, wars, increasing spiritual and sexual impotence, degeneracy and finally the end of culture and civilization. \"The spiral represents an up ward path\" ( Infinity 1/10). Nature requires a type of motion which is primarily planetary, spiral, because this type heats neither the water, or as the case may be, the air serving as the medium of motion, nor the implosion motor — th e design of which mu st embody the system - 6 -"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"of spiral curves presented by the original model — but which cools them instead to their natural point of anomaly. This anomaly is the natural boundary line between the posi- tive atmosphere and the negative geosphere with their different potentials. This explains nature s constant unrest. Optimum conditions for life are found within this boundary zone which, in humans and animals, is the normal blood temperature. Motors, too, have a certain atmospheric state of anomaly in which they function best or, as in the case of our current engines, in which their pressure and performance reach the highest peak. THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE EARTH When water, the life blood of the earth, is centrifuged or exposed to excessive, unfiltered solar radiation, its tempera- ture rises. It develops a \"fever\", due to the decentralizing reactive forces which are generated in the process. This brings life to the harmful microorganisms which may be present in the water, since their growth is stimulated by higher temperatures. They begin to proliferate rapidly and deprive the physical primo- geniture (water) of its vital energy, so that as soon as it has exceeded a certain tem perature — this limit begins already at +9° Centigrade — it becomes life less and dies for lack of high- grade elements, becoming more and more shallow and unpalatable. However, if we restore in this congenitally diseased, \"can- cerous\" water its original, that is, primarily planetary, radio- axial movement by means of special vessels and devices, its tem- perature falls and the pathogenic bact eria die in the absence of temperature which allows them to proliferate. This does not mean, however, that cooling with ice or by other artificial means will restore the original pr operties of water which has been heated. This can be achieved only by using spiral geometric curves capable of restoring the water's diamagnetism and of re- generating its etheric forces. Water deteriorates when its t emperature exce eds a certain limit, whether due to overheating and overexposure to light, or to the action of compressor turbines, water wheels, pressure pumps, etc., whereupon such valuable fish as trout, salmon, etc., can no longer breed. During the spawning season these species, as we know, have to migrate upstream toward the head of the river, where the water temperature is +4° C, since their young, lacking the necessary adaptability, can d evelop only at this temperature. This is also the reason why the spiral should be used for technical purposes, releasing and making available unsuspected supplies of power. This however, can be accomplished not through explosion — the spiral cannot be used in internal combustion engines — but throu gh impansion and implosion; not through de- struction but through consolidat ion, synthesis and purification. Today, preference is given in general to a type of motion - 7 -"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"which is centrifugal, thus excentric, result ing in high energy losses and being responsible for the criminally wasteful exploi- tation of natural raw materials, seeing that it wastes far more than it produces. This is a t ype of motion which represents in nature a cancerogenic factor. Unfortunately, it has not occur red to science so far that Centripetence permits achieving the very oppos ite of what is pro- duced by Centrifugence. Nature knows how to protect herself from all danger. It is quite helpless only when it faces such totally destructive devices as atomic bombs. Even Ce ntrifugence is de- structive because of heat and the decentralizing reflected ra- diations it produces. The opposite is t rue of Centripetence or the spiral movement. ELIMINATION OF COSTLY FUELS AND NUCLEAR FISSION This fact proves not only that truly unbelievable supplies of energy can be mobilized, but also that this can be done al- most without expendi ture, since the method requires neither costly fuels nor nuclear fission; and only a small amount of water or air, which is refined in the pr ocess. The pull of the suction spiral can yield any required a mount of energy. Remem- bering that during hurricanes and cyclon es the same suction for- ces are at work and that they lift easily tons of sea water, whole buildings, or even railroad trains which fall into their paths, one can imag ine what could be achie ved were it possible to produce them by mechanical me ans. A great visionary and inventor has been able to find t he answer to this spendid riddle by submitting nature to a careful and close scrutiny. In this case however, the difficulty was not how to discover the mysterious and re sistance-less suction forces, but how to design the proper tubes, sin ce ordinary round tub es cannot be used. It meant finding a tube design which would make it pos- sible to control these forces. Viktor Schauberger was fortunate enough to wrest also this secr et from nature, but for the time being it cannot be ciscussed due to the status of the patent rights. Truly careful observation can help solve even the most difficult problems. Those still hampered by obsolete physical and technical con- cepts find it hard to understa nd such natural laws, because they are still firmly convinced that a motor must be su pplied at one end with 100% energy in the form of coal, oil, water or the like, in order to deliver at the other 10 to 30% effective power. With Implosion this ratio is reversed! The tempe rature gradient can be utilized almost 100 % since there are vi rtually no friction losses. In the case of the Implosion, an impu lse starts the suc- tion spiral, whereupon the whole turbine be gins to breathe like a living organism; or, when water is used, to act like an arter- ial or venous circulatory system. It produc es at the same time a biological vacuum and continues to function until the supply - 8 -"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"of energy which is stored in the material, that is, in the moving medium, has been used up. FRICTION-LESS AND HEAT-LESS POWER This amazing and hitherto unknown phenomenon can be explained by a friction-less movement of m edium structures. This is exactly how nature solves the problem of friction-less and heat-less speed increases. The answer to this problem is a basic requirement in the production of power. Its cost is negligible, but it can pro- duce the desired results only w hen the artificially accelerated flowing medium enters an advancing vor tex whose suction force in- creases as the flowing medium gradually undergo es mechanical and specific condensation while being tightly coiled. A molecular suc- tion point is formed on its own axis. This point draws the rapidly flowing medium from the walls toward the center, twisting it into a spiral which can be imagined as a screw within a screw. This prevents friction and reduces the temperature. Exactly the reverse is being done at present. As a result of Centrifugence, friction and resistance are increased; increased pressures lead to power losses and increased heat, all of which expresses itself in the form of excentric reactive forces which inhibit the synthesis of high-grade elements. As we can see, an inevitable inhibiting atomic force is generated. This force which grows as the square of the velocity, represents nature's emergency brake. This would have been learned long ago, if n ature had been observed with care. A continuous movement produced by rotation is not the same as rotation produced by means of pressur e. It does make a differ- ence whether concontrates of basic materials contained in a moving medium are drawn, or compressed. Through intentional or uninten- tional pull and suction one can generate water spontaneously, while through pressure one can produce only fire. This is why in its processes of synthesis nature employs only the spiral motion, in- asmuch as only the latter leads to healthy growth and development. IMPANSION AND IMPLOSION ARE UNKNOWN Impansion and Implosion are two terms which ca n be found in no dictionary, since they are s till practically unknown. Accor- ding to Viktor Schauberger, they are the opposite of expansion and explosion. While a gradual or sudden dilation l eads to expansion and explosion, a gradual or sudden contraction or concentration of liquid or gaseous bodies, air, produces a negative pressure, and through the latter, impansion and implosion. As a matter of fact, the product ion -of energy requires a tem- peature gradient, either an upw ard gradient r esulting from heat and pressure, or a downward gradient, resul ting from cooling and suction — negative pressure. However, in natural processes it does make a difference whether the temperature is raised or lowered. A rise in temperature leads to expansion and explosion. Further- more, the quicker this temperature rise, the greater the attend- ing energy losses, inasm uch as they grow in prop ortion to the speed - 9 -"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"at which the energy rise takes p lace. The highest natural resis- tance forces are encountered in the case of the H-bomb explosions, when the heat released reaches up to a 100 million degrees Cen- tigrade. After explosion, na ture reduces this monstrous heat by applying suction forces. Suction al ways produces a natural temperature drop and acts like a brake on the pressure wave gen- erated by the explosion, which w ould otherwise destroy the earth. Therefore, an energy production method based on an upward temperature gradient, is the worst possible energy waste and a destructive process. T he quicker the medium -- air, or water — is cooled (this takes but a few seconds when the spiral rotates very rapidly), the greater the energy effect, since the friction- less contraction instead of mee ting with increasing resistance, meets with lessening resi stance. Not only water but also air are instantly cooled to their respe ctive points of anomaly. And so we are forced to conclude that the stronger the pressure, the higher the energy losses; while on the other hand, the stron- ger the suction pull, the higher the energy output. THE COLLAPSING EFFECT OF SUCTION The impansion and implosion-producing temperature gradient shows various and hitherto unrealized aspects: 1. Suction is more powerful than pressure. Whereas pressure elicits resistance, suction results in general collapse attended by no resistance. Introversion is likewise more effective tha n extroversion, a nd represents the only possible means of physical and of spiritual ascent. 2. Suction, even when its gradu ation is not controlled, is more effective than explosive pressure. Therefore, when mechanically produced, it must be carefully adjusted and regulated according to certain definite rules. Its in- tensification, quite o bviously, must be allowed to take place within a predeter mined period of tim e and must be fully controlled. 3. Suction can cool even to the point of anomaly; when pro- perly controlled it preserv es and saves materials; it permits the effective energy output to attain its na- tural optimum level and its maximum developmen t within the allotted cosmic time-span. However, the mechanically pro duced temperatu re drop can reach anomaly (the ge ospherical and atmosp herical zone of neu- trality) only if the suction spir al is employed. The spiral concentrates and contr acts. This contraction cools, and the cooling process creates a vacuum . The vacuum, again, has a suck- ing effect and as the spiral revolves faster and faster, the whole process generates a diamagnetic forc e which is merely a manifes- tation of the Etheric l ife-force without which there can be no life on earth. - 10 -"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"VORTEX POWER EQUAL TO NUCLEAR POWER Only a spiral contract ion of the mov- ing medium can produ ce a diamagnetic vac- uum which leaves in its wake resistance- less suction. The hig her the rate of flow the stronger the sucti on pull; which, as the flowing medium strikes certain nozzles produces an implosion. Those forces, which can be produced by rotation in a system of spiral geom etric curves , are as powerful as nuclear forces. The significant role of spiral motion in natural processes is demonstrated by whirlwinds, cyclones, typhoons, water spouts, and finally by the whirlpools which oc cur in water. When cold and warm air masses meet over an ocean at a tangent, the resulting temperature dr op and liberation of h eat, plus the ro- tation of the earth, prod uce cyclones and hurr icanes. Due to the rotation of the earth, winds flowing toward a low pressure area do not move in a straight line , but along a spiral. The strong effect of the ear th's rotation on cyclones is demonstrated by the fact that south of the Equator they turn clockwise, while north of the Equator they tu rn counter-clockwise. Windspouts are a natural proof that a temperature drop is capable of re- leasing enormous energies. In rivers, whirlpools are formed when t he flowing masses of water encounter, and are deflecte d by, tear-drop shaped or egg-shaped stones of special composit ion, lying at the bottom of the river bed. The larger these stones and the greater the volume of water the y deflect, the greater the temperature drop that is produced, and the larg er the whirlpool that is formed. Near Grein, Austria many boats and rafts used to perish in the waters of the Dan ube on account of such whirlpools. Many navigators tried to guid e their row-boats thro ugh the eddies, but their offerings and prayers did not help and innumerable boats were lost because they did not have the power to pull out of the vortices. Finally, a simple ma n had the idea to break up the rocks lying on the floor of the river, rocks which had the shape of tear-drops, an d which were responsib le for the danger- ous eddies. As soon as this had been done, the whirlpools disap- peared almost completely. It was proved conclusi vely already twenty years ago by Vik- tor Schauberger to the famous h ydrologist Prof. Forcheimer that when a stream of water is deflec ted tangentially by a stone of a certain shape and comp osition, and no larger than a child's head, the temperature of the water drops by 0.1 to 0. 5° C. Such a tem- perature drop can redu ce the temperature of one cubic liter of water 0.1° C. and is equivalent of 42.7 mkg effective power. The same is true of a te mperature increase. In summer, to raise - 11 -"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"the temperature of a river such as the Danube (delivery about 800 cubic meters/second), for exampl e, to 20° C. bathing tem- perature, it takes about 60 million PS or 45 million KW. This energy is freely supplied by the sun. We know that as it is being heated the water loses much of its natural properties, becoming first undrinkable, then de ad, and finally putrid. In contrast, cooling to the point of anomaly +4° Centigrade, by imparting to it a spiral motion, restores its original pro- perties, so it becomes once more like fine spring water. It is true that cyclones and hurricanes cause great damage due to the fact that they cannot be controlled. However, they are rare phenomena and t heir effects weigh less in the balance than those of fire, which in the form of lightning, storms and con- comitant phenomena, is known in all parts of the earth, even where cyclones are never seen. LIGHTNING, THE NATURAL PURIFYING AGENT Of course, there is some value even to lightning which is a natural purifying agent cleansing the atmosphere by fire, freeing it of elements not yet ready for a higher developmental form which may have reached it due to excessive light and heat. The explosion of a storm precipitates these substances and pro- duces an atmospheric discharge. Unfortunately it cannot elim- inate radio-activity (from atomic fall-out). The return of the positively charged substances from the atmosphere to the eart h leads, due to the planetary motion of the earth, to a polarity change, so that these substances are able to begin once more their p hysical ascent. The same hap- pens in the spiritual realms. All that has not been sufficiently purified must return an d go through the proc ess of purification once more. In nature this process of regre ssion takes place normally, without disturbances, through expansion. ( The symbol for this is the Swastika, or hooked cross, revolving counter-clockwise.) The latter should be understood as a slow dilation, produced by light and warmth, which gives rise to mild electrolytic proces- ses which spearate or dissociate the higher from the lower ele- ments. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DIAMAGNETISM The same diamagnetic vacuum which can be artificially crea- ted by impansion and implosion, can be found in the human chest, as accidentally discovered in 1908 by Prof. Sauerbruch who, nevertheless, could not know at that time th at this diamagnetic phenomenon occurs not on ly in the human thorax, but in all living beings and even in the e arth itself. (The symbol for this is the - hooked cross revolving clockwise.) Diamagnetism is generat ed when such a medium as air, water, or earth (necessarily containing dipolar trace elements) is forced to move primarily in a radio-axial, that is, spiral and centri- - 12 -"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"petal manner, thus exactly like the earth. Due to this totally unknown, yet primary method of synthesis, our planet is able to overcome gravitation, thus to levitate, to float in space and to move independently, condensing and refining its masses. Conversely, when the same medium is forced to move in the opposite manner, i.e., axio-radially (being centirifuged), its movement generates an atomic hyperpressure, a dilating and rarifying heat which inhibits the absorption and resorption of superfluous elements, and so prevents the natural respiratory processes. The rotation of the earth gene rates a diamagneti c force also in water. It enables, for example, the rainb ow trout to remain almost stationary and motionless in the midst of a rushing stream, or to flee in case of danger with lightni ng speed, or — during the spawning season --to move upstream by rising through the center of the cycloidal swirling magnetic axis of the water falls. Let it be added that diamagne tism, although discovered by Faraday already in 1845, so far has found no practical application, because it represents a type of magnetism which cannot be adapted to fire technology, inasmuch as it checks excessive temperature increases and consequently prevents ignition in motors. DIAMAGNETIC OR PARAMAGNETIC, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE On the basis of certain personal significant observations, Faraday classified metals as pa ramagnetic and diamagne tic. The so-called magnetic — or better -- paramagnet ic metals are at- tracted by the magnet and show an axial arrangement; while the diamagnetic metals are repelled by the magnet and present an equatorial arrangement. It was found that the paramagnetic group contains not only iron, nickel and cobalt (whose magnetic pro- perties have long been familiar), but also manganese, chromium, cerium, titanium, palladium, platinum, osmium, and almost all ferrous alloys. The diamagnetic group contains in the first place bismuth, then antimony, zinc, lead, copper, silver and gold. For example, if a s mall bismuth rod susp ended from a thread of raw silk is placed between the two poles of a very powerful electromagnet and made to swing horizontally, it is repelled by both poles. Therefore it positions itself at right angles (equa- torially) to a line connecting the two poles; whereas an iron rod assumes an axial (normal) po sition to this line (NS). On the strength of this behavior, all bodies can be classi- fied either as paramagnetic or diamagnetic. It was discovered, furthermore, that glass, carbon disulphide, and other non-conduc- tors are also highly diamagnetic. Each diamagnetic body, moreover, has a negative magnetic number, i.e., a numb er which gives the measure of its magnetic response. Another interesting phenomenon is observed w hen liquids are - 13 -"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"magnetically tested. The liquids to be tested are put into thin- walled glass test tub es (or watch glasses) and placed near a powerful electromagnet whose poles are set very close together. In the case of magnetic liquids the contents of the test tube rise over the edges of the la tter and gather together forming a little mound on the sides next to the poles. In the case of diamagnetic liquids, the samples in the test tubes expand ax- ially, and contract equatoria lly, forming in the middle not a ridge, but a valley running equatorially to the two poles. HOW TO GENERATE DIAMAGNETIC FORCES In Viktor Schauberger's discoveries diamagnetism is a cru- cial factor, or rather a factor which changes the whole picture and brings it into relief. Schauber ger found that when air, earth, or water is agitated and coiled (with light, heat and air excluded) radio-axially, i.e., from outside inwards, diamagnetic forces are generated. Our present technology, which fa ils to recognize this type of motion, has been unable to produce diamagnetism, or to adapt it to practical purpose s. It has applied, hitherto, only para- magnetic forces and Centrifugence, disturbing thereby the vital processes of synthesis. As already stated, centripetal c ontraction produces a tem- perature drop which creates a vacuum. Not only the temperature drop but also the resulting vacuum can be measured, with a man- ometer. The temperature drop in quest ion proceeds more rapidly or less, depending on the rate of speed of the swirling medium, and may reach anomaly. This process produces a specific conden- sation and volume decrease manifesting itself in the first stage in the form of an in- drawing suction. In th e second stage this suction produces in a hermetically enclosed space a biological vacuum which generates in the third stage t he above mentioned type of magnetism which , in its turn, produces at the terminal end an implosion force which is the primary, all-animating, original atomic energy. The present model of the atom, which is so familiar by now, is far from being the ultimate representation of matter. Even the lightest atoms ar e composed of a number of pulsating prim- ary atoms. These are either pos itive or negative, either mascu- line or feminine, due to which they pulsa te like spiralling microcosmic levro- or dextro-rot ary hearts. Without diamag- netism --this extremely subtle type of etheric force — there can be no procreation and no progress, whether in the plant, the animal or the h uman kingdom. There can be no growth, no proliferation and no perfecting of the na turally multiplying generations. Diamagnetism actually is a vi tal force, an atomic energy which is already ethe ric. which builds and sustains physical life in all its aspects. It has been stated by Profs. Warburg - 14 -"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"and Domagk that this cell building type of synthesis or vital force is possible only when the cells are supplied by the blood with sufficient oxygen, or Prana as it is more accurately called by the Hindoos, oxygen being only the coarser carrier of this far more subtle etheric force. This etheric energy is absorbed primarily by the various species of conifers and ever- greens, which store it in the tips of their needles. This ex- plains why there is always an excess, not a deficiency, of oxygen in forests; these natural water reservoirs and air filtering plants store vital energy and dispe nse it to mankind. Oxygen deficiency, let us add, lends to the development of cancer cells and its effects can be elimi nated only by supplying purified oxygen. TOO MUCH OXYGEN IS DANGEROUS There is a vast difference howe ver, whether this oxygen is freely inhaled (as air) or forced into the lungs (as pure oxy- gen). Due to the vacuum in his chest, man is forced to inhale; but for example, a chi ld given too much chemically pure oxygen from a cylinder may have blindness as a result, while an adult develops almost fatal pneumonia. It is generally known that even ordinary atmospheric oxygen produces blood decomposition when it is introduced by a hypodermic needle into the veins, because once in the bloo d it becomes agg ressive, binds the blood albumen which has an opposite charge and has been weakened by disease, changing the metabolism in such a manner that instead of life-giving forces, atomic de structive energies are set into motion. These destructive energies which have predominantly an expanding and explosive effect, attack the structure of the cells, drastically extend their nuclei, and finally rupture them. A similar process takes place in the atomic reactor when pure carbon (graphite) is bom barded with un screened cathode rays which produce a radiation rate so high it is almost imperceptible, and therefore potentially very dangerous. Now then, when an organism th at has been attacked by cancer is supplied with diamagnetically charged, high grade water con- taining up to 90% energized hydro-carbons (and correspondingly less used up oxygen) the negatively charged diamagnetic reduction elements bind and emulsify the excess oxygen and inactivate it by cooling it. As a result, the fever recedes and that, which Prof. Warburg calls the V ital Force, is restored. It concentrates in new cells, forcing them to proliferate steadily, arrests the development of the adjoining cancerou s cells, and finally de- stroys them. Cancer, which is the result of fire (i.e., over heating and combustion) can be cured only by diamagnetic nega- tively charged high grade water, as established already in 1935. But although the produ ction of such water would have benefitted millions of people, op position supported by the medica l authori- ties prevented the construction of water purification plants. Moreover, the first models of th e equipment were destroyed during - 15 -"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"the war, so it has become possible to start collecting necessary data on the production of diamagnetic power by means of mechani- cal devices only recently, all such work having been stopped by the war and the ten years of Austria's milit ary occupation. Today we know at least that we are dealing with basic pro- cesses employed by Natur e herself, that catalys ts play in them an important role; and, natu rally, that only those substances and materials can be use d which are diamagnetic carriers. Contrary to the concepts whic h hitherto have been consid- ered in physics as valid, magn etism is not a quiescent field of force, but energy in flux. This was demonstrated long ago by the Vienese scientist, Felix Ehrenhaft. Ion s can have a magnetic as well as an electric charge. The whole ear th is permeated by spiralling centripetal m agnetic currents. Spiral motion is es- pecially typical of magnetism and constitutes the very basis of planetary motion and of all movement in the universe. DIAMAGNETISM AND BREATH Respiration binds elements belonging to the atmosphere with those belonging to the geosph ere. In other words, it blends and emulsifies substances which have been purified by the diffusion apparatus (filter) wit h substances which have been filtered through the hermetically seal ed blood and lymph systems. The emulsified product of this reductive blending pro- cess is represented in the crust of the ea rth by its physical primogeniture (tellurian waters), while in such higher life forms as plants, animals and humans, by sap or blood . Since neither blood nor sap can circ ulate without diamagnetism , and since there can be no diagmagnet ism without the spiral mo tion, it is obvious why blood and sap do not move in a circle, but in cycloidal curves, coiling agai n the diffuse excess elements and combining them intimately in the presence of suitable catalysts (catalysts which Goethe used to cal l \"connecting energy fields\"). We are dealing in this case with extremely subtle rays which are released and activated when differently charged precious metals in infinitely fine dispersion are undergoing concentra- tion due to the centr ipetal movement of the blood or sap, and which in their turn bring to gether oxygen and the excess pro- ducts of digestion which have reached t he blood, or sap, stream through the. intestinal filter. This, however, is p ossible only when t he median s tructures enclosing bipolarity c harged sediments, whic h are just waiting for a natural triggering factor, are set in radioaxial motion and begin to unfold producing a di amagnetic vacuum. This diamagnetic vacuum is an atomic suction force which absorbs and draws in the oxygen from the ambient air. This oxygen, on the other hand, has to pass through cer tain filters, the skin, the rind, or bark, to absorb only the finest elements. Were it not so, the concen- tric pressure of the air would force in also less valuable elements. - 16 -"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Diamagnetic respiration is the opposite of atmospheric pres- sure, inasmuch as it draws in only excess diffuse oxygen, prana. This diamagnetic force is also beh ind the power of levitation which maintains the earth in a state of labile equilibrium and forces it to revolve around its own axis (called, in general, the magnetic axis). This diamagneti c force which acts axially in all directions, allows the earth to levitate spontaneously. THE ALL-PERVADING FIFTH ELEMENT, AETHER Diamagnetism is an emanation, or stream, of the universal ether (the fifth of the known basic elements, the other four being Fire, Earth, Air and Water, and their symbol, again, is the Swas- tika or Hooked Cross. The fifth element is the point or center on which the other four pivot). It produces constant suction whose surplus energy spirals upwards in a steady flow resulting in and endless inhalatory and ex halatory process, a process which can be mechanically reproduced. Examples of Hooked Crosses, from the Rosicrucian \"Manual\": Modern motors generate waves, and these waves impart a centrifugal or radioaxial move- ment to the surrounding masses of matter. The friction attending this pro cess generates first heat, then fire. This is the end result of a reverse process of elementary compensation, be cause fire is an agent of com bustion and therefore acts exactly like the pathogenic bacteria which are nature's purifying agents whose task it is to carry out the degenerati ve and destructive processes that protect life as a whole. When they are unable to perform this function, they must be aided by fire and burning This is Nature's way. However, it is catastrophic when man makes use of these destructive powers in building culture and civilization while at the sam e time furthering the prolifera- tion of pathogenic bacteria in the waters by poisoning, over- heating and sterilizing the l atter, either by such mechanical means as compressor turbines, or by destroying the growth that protects the banks and shores. The various types of machinery being used at present — centrifugal motors, propellers, agricultural mach inery, etc. -- are dangerous reactors. They release destructive atomic - 17 -"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"forces whose effects grow in proportion to the speed of rotation. It is obvious that they destroy the diag magnetic axial force which absorbs and absorbs oxygen. They centrifuge the water and supply it with a constant stream of warm oxyge n so that it as- phyiates and decomposes, all of which leads to the death of tel- lurian waters, of rivers and of seas. TREES, SPRING WATER AND DIAMAGNETISM It seems that until now few people have posed themselves the question why most springs are located high in the mountains and, furthermore, why only in wooded areas. (The latter is true even of springs situated in the lowland s.) It is an established fact that when a natural mountain spring is deprived of its tree covering and exposed to direct sunlight, it dries up and does not begin to flow again until af ter the protective shade has been restored. When permanently deprived of its natural shade, it either appears at another place, where adequate shade is avail- able, or vanishes forever. Some mountain springs disappear never to return after having been exposed even to slightly st ronger light for a longer period of time. It is also a fact th at our supply of mountain water is shrinking as the protecting forests are being thinned and cut down. When the mountains are bare, rivers turn into thin trickles or dry up altogether, and when it rains they become raging torrents. With no trees to retain the w aters, they rush int o the valleys carrying destruction and silting up their estuaries with rocks and stones. Thus, we are forced to reach the conclusion that when the forest dies, water dies too, and all life comes to an end, because without water there is no life. The water of true mountain sprin gs has a temperature of 4°C. just before coming to th e surface. Under the influence of light this temperature rises very rapidly, because the positive charge of the atmosphere makes itself felt with li ghtning speed. When the effects of this positive ch arge are reinforced by those of direct light, rapid chang es take place in the specific gravity of the flowing spring water. In other words , it becomes lifelsss as it loses more and more of its diamagnetic powers of levitation. THE LEVITATION OF CHARGED WATER Diamagnetically charged water, blood, or sap can levitate. Water which is diamagnetically charged and enriched with carbonic acid refreshes and animates. Those who drink it feel better, healthier, despite its higher gravity. Schauberger was moved by these observations to alter the polarity of water (or air) after it had be en exposed to the ac- tion of the atmosphere and to make it negative once more by using a system of suction curves. The results he obtained were amazing. The water which had suddenly recove red its negative - 18 -"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"charge (in the presence of certain catalysts, with light and other factors exclu ded) rose high in a caref ully insulated stand pipe of special design and made of special alloys — although the pressure was atmospheric — while th e volume of water in the tank remained unchanged. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALI TATIVE ANIMATED WATER This is how Vikto r Schauberger disc overed an artificial method of increasing wat er, as well as an an swer to the question: What makes water, which has been negatively d iamagnetically char- ged by the rotation of the earth, rise to the top of mountains, provided light has been excluded and there are trees giving it the necessary protective shade? This discovery taught hi m how to create an artificial moun- tain spring and supplied him with proof that water influenced by the geosphere — that is, animated water -- undergoes a quantita- tive increase and a qualitative improvement. In other words it grows and develops exactly like plants, animals or people when a soul is breathed into it. Thus diamagnetism and levitation explain the mystery and origin of mountain springs. Th e planetary, spiral movement of the earth imparts to the tellurian waters under the surface of the earth a predominantly negative magnetic charge. The earth (geosphere) itself is also negati vely diamagnetic, while the atmosphere is positively diamagnetic. Since opposite poles are attracted to each other, and like poles are repelled by eath other, negatively charge d water is repelle d by the earth, i.e. it is lifted, while at the same time it is attracted by the atmos- phere. Thus, pure water levitates and rises to the top of moun- tains, while predominant ly positive water is repelled by the posi- tive atmosphere and comes down to earth in the form of rain, to undergo its process of purification once m ore. When the earth happens to be also po sitively charged due to excessive sunlight, it can no longer attract rain, as in deserts. Therefore an excess of light or fire is the enemy of water, and vice versa. It is left to man's reason to protect the mantle of vegetation covering the earth so as to preserve life. Under the present circumstances, however, this is not possible today because forests are being cut down all over the world. Steppes, sands and waste lands are advancing; even without atom bombing whole continents are heading toward destruction due to the ex- haustion of their natural resources. They must sink to be reborn and emerge from the wate rs millions of years later. The eradica- tion of the protecting and life-givin g vegetation which mantles the earth is additional ly hastened by radioact ive peroxidation of the atmosphere. Water loses its ability to a scend mountains when the soil is deprived of woods shading it from direct sunlight. Without this natural screen of trees, ground wat ers which are found at - 19 -"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"the deepest levels in deserts and closest to the surface in forests, are forced to recede. Thus the death of forests means the death of water and of all life. This is something which could not be overemphasized, since many are still unaware of this fact. THE REGENERATION OF DISEASED WATER Schauberger's discoveries prove among others that water can be multiplied and improved by applying planetary motion and simply imitating nature's methods, and conv ersely that when water is ruined by centrifugation and such devices as compressor turbines, water wheels, etc., it becomes devitalized, loses its power of levitation, ceases to breathe, asphyxiates and — with continued exposure to sunlight -- recedes and vanishes altogether. Of course, in the bosom of Mother Earth this diseased water is ga- thered up again and its polarity reversed, whereupon it is re- generated and ready to reappear as a fresh and bubbling mountain spring at a new place, where it still finds the protective shade of trees it requires. Be that as it may, our supplies of fresh water are steadily shrinking. In various branches of industry wa ter experts worry and desperately search for a solution to the water problem. This search is bound to be fruitless unless they turn to Schauberger's discoveries and replace the present fi re technology with a bio- technology that will protect and benefit life. The water and the energy problems can be solved simultan- eously if magnetism is produced by mechanic al means, and all attempts to produce atom ic energy are abandoned. People can learn only by trial and error. Perhaps the error we made in applying fire metho ds indiscriminat ely was necessary to make us realize how dangerous it is to reverse and alter the natural basic motion (the one indicated by Natu re as our only means of development) and how w rong it is to empl oy combustion and other destructive pr ocesses to build a c ivilization. This explains the decadence of our cult ure. When people use only excentric or centrifugal forces for technical purposes they deteriorate both morally and spiritually. To use nuclear energy produced by the explosion and fission of atoms is a fatal blunder an d a crime against humanity and against the earth its elf. Hence it is on ly natural that the branch of science which has conjur ed up these horrors has found itself in a blind alley from which there would be no escape were it not for the discovery of diam agnetism, this universal life force without which there can be no respiration and no life. Fortunately, it can be mechanical ly produced and used to give earth, air and water the chance to breathe again. The most convincing and obvious pro of that life is gradu- ally perishing can be found in the streams and rivers of our industrial areas were water is already so polluted by industrial waste waters and sewers that it resembles drai nage from a manure - 20 -"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"pit. As a result our un derground water and supplies of drinking water are gradually becoming unfit for human consumption. They are killing people, just as they have killed the fish which only a few years ago used to splash in them. Water chlorination is also harmful to the human organism. Today the Rhine and the Weser are Europe's most polluted rivers. Actually they are no longer rivers but streaming sewers, as sta ted by the German Minister of State, Dr. Seebolm. WATER IS THE \"BLOOD\" OF THE EARTH Healthy blood is the life carrier of the human organism. Pure water plays the same role in the economy of the earth. Thus the preservation of life requires that water be kept pure. But water can be pure and wholesome only when it is charged by a magnetic flux which not only stim ulates the proliferation of apathogenic bacteria but also animates and regenerates it. The general public is still ob livious to the seriousness of the water problem, although it is from this that disaster will come (even without atom bombs) in particular to our most developed areas. The water table is sinking, water is vanishing because its greatest enemy, but also its most important consumer — our fire technology — is poisoni ng it and burni ng it out. Our water economy, unaware of the t rue reasons, attributes its dis- appearance to a consumption exc eeding the natural water supply. As a matter of fact, water consumption in industry and in homes is higher today than it was in the past. But what causes these losses of underground waters? In the first place, deforestation and the exposure to strong light of regions which would be natural reservoirs had they not been ruined by the destruction of t he geospherical diamagnetism. In the second place, the wrong and harmful methods by which rivers are being regulat ed. We have le arned that it is a great mis- take to grade river beds and to encase their banks in rigid stone walls. Viktor Schauberger fought for years both these methods and the destruction of forests with equal passion. Now, that many of his predictions have come true, and when it is mostly too late to undo t he harm done, these mistakes are being recognized; but nothing is being done to remedy their con- sequences. In all truth, the only effective measure would be to apply Schauberger's discoveries. THE SINUSOIDAL CURVE FOR CHARGED WATER There is good reason why r ivers wind and twist through valleys and plain s. They are tryin g to preserve the primary form of the sinusoidal curve produced by the slightly declining planetary movement of the ear th. The function of this curve is to create and maintain in rivers a diamagnetic axis which keeps their waters alive and pure and endows them with their carrying and towing capacity. When the me ander is elimina ted by regula- - 21 -"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"tion and, furthermore, when the vegetation protecting the banks (willows, alders, etc.) is destroyed, the resulting damage is threefold. First, the magnetic axis is destro yed and the river's carrying, towing and cleansing properties are impaired. Secondly, with the shading veget ation gone an d the resulting overexposure to sunlight, the oxygen content of the water is overheated, be- comes aggressive and it escapes; the water evaporat es, dries out and decomposes. Thirdly, the graded river bed carries off water very rapidly instead of keeping it in the soil. The floor of the river sinks deep er, and deeper causing th e underground water to escape and the table to drop; it \"bleeds the land to death\". THE DECREASE IN FERTILITY OBVIOUS The bed of the Rhine has already dropped one meter (and more in certain places) because it is graded and regulated -- something which Viktor Schauberger tr ied to prevent in his days by instal- ling suction spirals. The floor of the Danu be between Ulm and Passau has been sinking at the rate of 1% cm. a year since its regulation. In the Bavarian part of Swabia the River Wertach has cut so deep into the subsoil since it was regulated that its floor is now lies as much as ten meters be low the level of its banks. This shows that its water has lost its magnetic axis and its powers of magnetic levitation, its polarity having been changed to positive due to excessive insulatio n. As a further consequence it has c ut through the adjoining horizons of under- ground water causing the latter to escape. This has reduced the fertility of the surrounding fields which are now threatening to change to a barren steppe. The experts did not even guess until recently at the enor- mous importance of the diamagnetic properties of the earth and failed to realize that these properties we re destroyed by the direct action of light or fire. The only thing that can keep the earth from becoming a desert, in order to protect the primary source of life, water, from deat h, is the art of multiplying and improving water. Today the main questi on is: What is more important for the immediate development of the earth, water or fire? We know only too well that, indirectly, fire makes it po ssible to acti- vate machinery; but it is a completely new discovery that by artificially producing and increasing wa ter we can obtain better and cheaper energy and that we can restore, besides, the vegeta- tion whose growth has been affec ted by an excess of fire. Thus, by changes in technology to Implosion, not only would it be possible to so lve the energy problem, but also to achieve complete freedom from nutritional problems. - 22 -"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" Water purifier inside the water cleaner "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" SCHAUBERGER'S EXPERIMENTAL MODELS OF FLYING SAUCERS MADE FROM COPPER.

While the latter makes use of pressure forces produced by explosion, the implosion motor u tilizes the suction forces of implosion. When pressure forces are applied, the par- ticles they set in mo tion move away fro m the biological zero point, or zone of ano maly, being often hea ted until they are white-hot. A so-called heat bar rier is produced by the resulting enormous friction resist ance forces. One of th e greatest problems in aircraft constructi on, for example, is how to overc ome this barrier. In the case of the implosion motor there is no - heat bar- rier and no sound barrier, bec ause with fricti on almost entirely lacking, no heat is generated. On the conttary, due to the spiral contraction of the f lowing medium there is cooling to anomaly, and this creates a vacuum which increases the suction pull. In this case the reactive power factor grows, because the medium which has been set in motion is radio-axially swirled almost without resistance while at the same time being mechanically and physically concentrated and correspondingly c ooled. When noz- zles 1 mm in \"diameter are used, the flowing med ium detaches it- self — when its rotation reaches 1200 rpm -- from the walls of the spiral channel and its flow rate rises to approximately 1290 m/sec. This cor responds to nearly fou r times the speed of sound. The larger the diameter of the spiral rotor, the slower can be the rotation of the im pulsion motor which starts the suc- tion motor. An impulsion motor can coil and tighten water in a system of suction tubes spirally arrang ed around a conical shell into a homogeneous suction head and shoot it out through a special noz- zle built into the bottom. When t his stream of water, which is like a steel wire tapering to a suction point, is intermittently interrrupted by a shut off valve of special construction and made of a special alloy, a reactive back- pressure force is generated which acts in the same direction as the implosion motor. The speed of this back pressure for ce corresponds to the previously mentioned outflow rate. It s upplies the rotor shaft with some 17.9 HP/lit/sec. through each 1 mm nozzle (i.e., an out outlet cross-section of 0.79 sq. mm, as selected on the basis of math- ematical calculations) which can be utilised as a reactive pro- jecting or lifting force. In the case of an implosion engi ne having a diameter of 1 - 23 -"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"meter, the lower surface of the suction rotor measuring slightly over 5 meters in circumference could easily accommodate 100 or more nozzles, each with 3-6 outlets. Assuming 600 outlets had been installed, and with the rotor turning at the rate of 1200 rpm, the lower rotor shaft could be supplied with some 10,740 HP in the form of a cyc lone-like projecting or lifting force. Such an energy output exceeds even the prese nt possibilities of a nuclear engine. A group of engineers and scientists from the University of Utah have designed a 7,000 HP nuclear railroad locomotive. THE MASSIVE PROBLEMS OF NUCLEAR POWER The estimated cost of this locom otive $1,200,000. The reactor will be 0.9 meters long, 0.6 m wide, and 0.9 m high. While it will be somewhat smaller than th e above-mentioned impl osion motor its capacity will be almost 4,000 HP lower. Furthermore, the nu- clear reactor will have to be surrounded by a 200 ton screen to eliminate at least part of it s deadly radio active emissions. To install this giant nuclear lo comotive on a single undercarriage would be impossible. It will require 12 supporting wheel axles and 24 wheels. Therefore it will be constructed as a dual unit having a total length of 48 meters. The front part of the locomot ive will house t he reactor and motor. The trailer will carry r ibbed, air-cooled heat exchanger tubes which will have to cool huge volumes of water of condensa- tion. The basic cost of this locomotive wi ll further be increased by the current costs of its nuclear fuel. It is estimated that these will reach $200,000 a year wi th the locomotive in full operation. The implosion motor presents none of these disadvantages, namely, the heavy; 1.2 m thick lead screen, the trailer with its watercooling installa tions, and' last but not least, the fuel costs, inasmuch as the implosion motor runs on a small quantity of water uninterruptedly, like a living organism, until the water has been used up and the tempe rature gradient is exhausted. Therefore the installation of implosio n engines opens the path to dazzling possibilities. Implosi on motors can be employed not only in stationary machi nery, but also in all types of vehicles, cars, aircraft, ships, etc. Th ey can replace all and sundry known types of motors and power engines. THE NON-POLLUTING IMPLOSION MOTOR Implosion motors are less expensive to construct, require no costly propellants and, moreover, permit biological exploitation so they have a positive effect. While the present types of power machinery bring into play their centrifugal motion decentralizing reactive forces which lead to cancer, implosion motors produce by their centripetal motion cond ensing reaction forces and dia- 24"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"magnetism. In the firs t case we have, from the biological point of view, de-animating and regres sive energies ac tivated by back- pressure; in the second case, rea ctivated project ing and stimu- lating energies which re sult in biological impro vement and growth. Of course the mechani cal production of d iamagnetism requires exact measuring and co ntrol methods, because even the best medi- cine can be harmful when admini stered in excessive doses. The necessary data on the application of the constructive diamagnetic forces will have to be collected on the basis of prac tical findings. OUR UNBEARABLE EXPLO SIVE POWER PLANTS Still another and ve ry important advan tage of the implosion motor is that in op eration it is both so undless and odorless; whereas, all combustion engines produce noise, smell, exhaust fumes and smoke, creating unbearable conditions when u sed in large numbers. Implosion motors on th e other hand, run noiselessly, without smoke, exha ust fumes or smell. In nature planetary motion is soundless, crashing noises being th e concomitant on ly of such destructive processes as storms. It must be admitted that th e design and construction of im- plosion motors presents great difficulties due to the fact that they imitate the prot otype of life (not to me ntion a totally new technology which at th e present time does not exist!). Their suction tubes must be arranged in a perfect spiral and therefore compasses cannot be used when wo rking on their design. Also, they have no transmission shaf t, while in all conventional power engines, which can produce energy only by me ans of circular, mostly centrifugal motion, th e transmission shaft is an essential part. The type motion of a conventiona l engines represents, biologically speaking, a stationary spin, thus a backwa rd motion, since in nature standstill is the eq uivalent of regression. SUCTION TURBINES AND HOME POWER PLANTS To begin with, impl osion motors will have to be used as suction turbines a nd home power plants. During the transition period suction turb ines will have to repla ce above all the com- pressor turbines now bei ng used in our conve ntional power plants. Schauberger's suction turbine will compl etely revolutionize the current power plant construction metho ds and will soon replace the present exclusive compressor turbine. The installation of suction turbines would r esult in substantial monetary and material savings. The fixed hydroelectric power plant and construction costs would be reduce d at least by 70 - 80%, since no longer would it be necessary to build such costly installations as — to mention but a few -- high dams a nd compression t unnels. Suction turbines, once they have been st arted, draw in water without fur- ther assistance, and th erefore require only a fairly shallow basin for their inflow and outflow waters . Thus, substantial savings would be realized, particularly in such construc tion materials - 25 -"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"as cement, reinforced concrete, structural steel, etc., which could then be util ised for road constructi on (in most countries the latter is lagging ), or other vital c onstruction projects. Water consumption being equal, the power output of suction turbines is 700 to 80 0% higher than the pow er output of compressor turbines. This means that cou ntries which already have hydro- electric power plants co uld meet their power r equirements over a longer period of years making us e of their present facilities. It has been calc ulated, for example, that in Austria the maximum total power output of the present hydroe lectric power plants (at least those which can be expanded) in full operation and with existing overhauled compressor turb ine systems, is 40 billion kilowatts a year. NEGATIVELY POLARIZED WATER Besides, the present compress or turbines ha ve seriously impaired the vital magnetic axis of flowing waters. This has drastically affected the ir buoyancy and towi ng capacity and, con- sequently, it has incr eased dredging costs. The polarity of the oxygen in the water is bein g changed by the compressor turbine systems. As a result it is becoming aggressive and it stimulates the proliferation of pat hogenic microorganisms in the water. An additional consequence is that in the adjoining areas the water table is sinking. Due to the breakdown of the magnetic axis, the useful bacteria which, under normal conditions, are the natural purifying agents, are dying. Th is could be reme died by two dif- ferent means: one, by installin g suction turbines which restore the magnetic axis, an d two, by placing su ction spirals along the river beds. It is an experimentally demonstrable fact that when healthy water has been centrifuged by compressor turbines or compressor blades for an hour, its pathogenic bacterial flora shows overnight a visible increase and, conversely, that such infected water can again be made into excellent spring water overnight by coiling it or swirling it f or an hour by me ans of a suction spiral in a centri- petal manner (in a manner r estoring its negative polarity). Schauberger succeeded not only in cha nging sea water into fresh water by cold distillation with the aid of the suction spiral, but also generated power in the process. The question of low-cost power p roduction can be positively solved not only by e quipping the existing large-scale hydroelec- tric works with suction turbines, but also by pr oducing for home use small power generating units designed to operate on a few liters of water — or, at a later stage of development, on air. This type of decentralized pow er supply system is much cheaper and far more practical. Many states would be spared the heavy expenditures entailed by the constructio n of large-scale power in- stallations, inasmuch as such investment s are covered by govern- ment funds, while home power plants would be purchased by private parties. These inexpensive units produce electricity at nominal - 26 -"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"cost and require no s pecial attention. They would pay for them- selves within a very short time and soon a number of industrial establishments, workshops and, above a ll, farms would have power plants supplying each of them with electrici ty according to the capacity of their units and their needs. These home units pres ent obvious advantages. In the first place they make the ow ner independent of ot her power networks. At the same time they appreciably reduce the consumption of high- voltage power and the nu mber of the usual feed lines, in partic- ular in regions still inadeq uately or unprovid ed with electricity. Secondly, they can be readily exported to ec onomically undeveloped countries making it po ssible for the latter to avoid heavy power plant construction investments. The home power u nit based on the Implosi on principle is in a developmental stage for the present (1954) since it is still ne- cessary to determine which type of connection wo uld be most suit- able for this model. IMPLOSION MOTOR IS A LIVING ORGANISM The unit is like a living organism, be cause once the water on which it oper ates has been let in, it starts to circulate like blood in the human body. The upper part of the un it houses a small suction turbine which is started with all valv es open. After the turbine has reached a ce rtain number of revo lutions perminute, a vertical circulation is started which resembles the circulation of the blood through the venous and arterial systems of the human or animal body, inasm uch as it follows a series of cycloidal spiral geometric curves. Due to the circulatory movem ent produced by the suction and spiral channels, the w ater in the tu rbine is coiled, that is, swirled and drawn to the center almost without friction. The water, while being me chanically and physically coiled, cools rapidly and its temperature drops to anomaly. As it undergoes specific condensat ion a vacuum is created which, in its turn, produces a constant suct ion pull. We find ex actly the same in the human chest which is fored to inhale air by a diamagnetically pro- duced vacuum. This mechanism underlies all circulatory motion. An excess hydraulic p ressure is produced in a water tank which is located in the lower part of the unit. This excess pressure constantly forces the op erating water upwards, through a lateral stand-pipe, At the same time the water is strongly pulled and en- trained in the same dir ection by the vacuu m which is created by the pulling forces of the spiral suction tu be, and it flows, car- rying an overcharge of terrestrial (negative) magnetism. When the turbine reaches a certain number of revo lutions per minute, the circulatory process within attains a speed several times higher than that of sound, and the molecularly condensed operating water leaves the suction spiral through special nozzles , forming an almost homogeneous suction he ad which revolves spontaneously - 27 -"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"around its own a xis like a cyclo ne or hurricane. This type of cyclone, however, can no longer be measured in the engine, because its intermittent swir ls and sweeps take place within such brief time-spans and over such short distances that they can be registered by mechanical meas uring instruments only if intercepted by special filter devices. THE GENERATION OF COLD LIGHT, AND VACUUM LIFT When this diamagnetically charged vertically emanating flow of energy is caught on pointed c ollectors (these must be carefully insulated on the outs ide) and conducted over further wire point spans (Brucken) into grounded vacuum tubes or bulbs, the inner surfaces of the evacuated bulb light up with a so-called cold or natural light. The inte nsity of this light in creases as the reac- tor rotates faster an d faster. This reactor is designed according to the laws of Nature, construct ed of the right alloys, and pro- perly insulated. Thus the construction of col d-current generators for use as home power plants will permit us to produce cheaper light and better ligh t, because the presen t electron-electrical hot light production method ar rests developmental processes and, with the existing type light bulbs, is harmful to the eyes. The nearly homogeneous suction head is coiled in the Schau- berger turbine around and into itself. Paren thetically speaking, the same has been observed just recently in cyclones. It has been established that the c enter of the vortex, which moves at the rate of 100 to 200 km/h, is surrounded by a second spiral which has been clocked at 800 km/h. The homogeneous suction head is deflected in the rotational direction of the suction turbine by check-valves (Bremsdusen -- perhaps; intercepting nozzles?) of very special design. The heretofore almost unrecognized spe- cific physical nature of suction and of the diamagnetism it gen- erates increases the force of rotati on -- which is the actual motive power of the engine - - a feature which represents the greatest advantage of the implosion engine in general, and of the home power plant in particular. The energy thus derived from water or air must be checked and captured, otherwise the s uction turbine wo uld \"run away\", meaning that it would levitate! This ca n be prevented by connec- ting it to a dynamo, which makes it possible to produce also ther- moelectric power. The basic difference between the compressor and the suction turbine is that while the first rotate s due to a great pressure gradient and converts only a fraction of this energy to electricity the other once having be en started, draws in spo ntaneously its motor medium and takes advantage -- against all hitherto known physical laws --of the descending temperature gradient. It can be safely said that even today the Schauberger implosion technique can bring the entire energy problem, and in particular the whole electronics industry, into new paths where it could not - 28 -"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"be rivaled by even atomic energy. Implosion motors offer us for the first time the po ssibility of making prac tical use of diamag- netism, this founda tion of the Life Force, and besi des, to obtain cold light in vario us colors without the help of gases. THE DIAMAGNETISM OF FLYING SAUCERS Those who have attentively foll owed the ideas presented in the above must h ave been struck by the t hought that the principles of modern aviation stand in direct contradiction to the natural processes of motion. Th e same propeller which is used by nature as a brake, serves in modern flight technology as a means of pro- pulsion, but with enormous energy los ses. It first whips or rams air back and then it p roduces a secondary ef fect the suction of which pulls the air vehicle forw ard. Similar pr ocesses of motion occue also with roc ket aircraft and with nu clear aircraft now un- der construction. Pressure force s are used in every field of technology, instead of suction f orces, although the latter are more effective, more economical, simp ler, and above all more in keeping with the laws of nature, due to the f act that they create a vacuum and diamagnetism and require no propell ant in the accep- ted sense of the word. Although by now the great wor ld powers must be acquainted with the principle of Flying Saucers. The USA has just recently requested permission to put into production ro cket-base flying saucers. Even interplaneta ry bases are to be constructed using exclusively pressure forces. This pr oves that even these attempts to reach the outer spaces are bi otechnically mis directed and that they will result in an enormous waste of money and m aterials. In the first place, interp lanetary flight is po ssible only by suction force based on diama gnetism, thus on etheric force which pervades the entire universe. This force allows the heavenly bodies to float freely through s pace and to move along their proper orbits. The universe can never be conquered by pressure forces or pres- sure radiation (Drucks trahlen). Billion s have been poured of late into this, as well as into atomic research; but it would be far better to spend this mon ey on useful projects, because aviation of the future will resort primarily to levit ation made possible by the suction spiral. In the case of diamagnetic levit ation, the force has to con- tend neither with a sound barri er nor with a heat barrier. The sound barrier does not ente r the picture beca use the future air vehicles -- whether disc or cigar-shaped -- will be effortlessly moved forward by the steadil y preceding suction pull . The opposite is true of our p resent aircraft (including the j et-propulsion ro- ckets) with produce, like explosion, first c ompression and resis- tance, and only thereup on suction, giving rise at the same time to-increasing friction and a high-invincible heat barrier. It releases as it breaks through the soun d barrier a trem endous pres- sure wave which belo w, at ground level, splinters windowpanes, - 29 -"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"breaks doors and gates, and flattens roofs. None of this occurs with fly ing discs which are propelled by diamagnetism, i.e., etheric forces. It goes without saying that Flying Saucers encounter no heat barrier since they generate a negative pressure and diamagn etism, Their metal or glass air frames are no more heated than the shell of an implosion engine. On the contrary, the y cool to their specif ic zone of anomaly. It would be impossi ble to imagine more p erfect air ve hicles. They have no sound barrier, no beat barrier, and they require no costly propellant because they generate their o wn motive power, that is diamagnetism. THE UNIVERSAL SO URCE OF ENERGY An abundance of this energy, Diamagnetism, is available throughout the universe. Theref ore, such a di amagnetic aircraft could travel around the earth not once, but two or three times at any given altitude without havin g to refuel. Actually, it could travel in outer space for yea rs, or as long as the crew did not have to replenish its food supplies. The following observations may s erve as proof that the Fly- ing Saucers are diamagne tically propelled. As already mentioned in our chapter on diagm agnetism, copper is a diamagnetic metal. When the UFO's fly at a relatively low rate of speed, they are surrounded by a light gr eenish hue. The sp ectral line, of burning copper has been obs erved to fall within this specific green. Furthermore, air samples taken from the atmosphere in the regions where, beginning in 1947, the UFOs have been frequently observed, have shown high concentrations of cop per particles in very fine dispersion. On the other han d, air samples taken before the appearance of the Flying Saucers, show a complete absence of cop- per. Of course, none of the observations made so far regarding the UFO's speed, perf ormance, take-off chara cteristics, and var- ious light effects can be brought in line with the familiar laws of physics. This, however, is no proof that unknown types of air vehicles can not exi st. After all, the m echanism of implosion and the nature of diamagnetism are ignored in modern physics and remain to be investigated and formally clarified. The objection that man would not be able to tolerate the speeds at which, as determined by radar, the UFOs move is by no means valid. This assumption would be valid only if we considered existing with the conventional flying methods which b ring pressure forces into play. How can we tell whether higher speeds would have any adverse effect on t he human organism if only suction forces were to be used? Undoubtedly, they key to the m ystery of propulsion used by Flying Saucers can be found in t he application of cycloidal spiral geometric curves. Only the latter would permit the UF Os to achieve the fantastic speeds of up to 60,000 km/h at which they have been seen to fly. Some of the maneuvers of these Saucers which we con- - 30 -"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"sider extraordinary are probably commonpla ce on other planets. It must be remembered th at Flying Saucers hav e been observed for centuries, long before men representing our own civilization had mastered air travel. ATOMIC EXPLOSIONS FO RCED THEIR APPEARANCE The mass appearance of the UFOs which, though still often disputed in official qu arters so as to calm the general public, can no longer be deni ed in the face of fact ual evidence, appears to be connected with th e effects of t he atom bombs be ing exploded on our planet. According to science, in our p lanetary system on ly the earth is inhabitable, wheref ore it alone can be po pulated. This hypo- theses is bound to be refuted some day by s cientists, just as it was the case with the old geocen tric concept of the world which placed the earth in the center of the un iverse and g randly per- mitted the sun to revolv e around one one of it s smallest satellites. We can rest assured that the cou ntless solar sys tems of the uni- verse must include a number of other habitable planets. We still ignore the number of fixed stars in our ga laxy. Perhaps they number a hundred million , perhaps more , who can tell? But we do know that our whole galaxy is but a small island in a sea of in- numerable galactic systems. H ence, what could be more illogical than to assume that t he entire universe co nsists of a mass of meteoric iron or of a c ertain quantity of elem ents spinning in space with rhyme or reason; and, what could be more presumptuous than to believe that only t he earth, this tiny gra in of sand in com- parison with the size of the universe, can be inhabited? Other planets, no d oubt, present diffe rent atmospher ic and living conditions. It would not be surprising, therefore, if various and varying forms of life had ev olved on spear ate planets. Indeed, even the principal human races of the earth show marked physical differences. Why the n, should other planets not be in- habited by supermen who have reached a much higher level of devel- opment than the inhabitants of the earth, supe rmen who for thou- sands of years have b een familiar with int erstellar navigation made possible by the application of etheric forces. Unfortunately, when men dream of venturing forth into outer space, their only aim is conquest.

Consequently it is highly dangerous to put into their hands this type of airc raft (though be tter this than nuclear types). Hence, it is of param ount importance to match techn ical advances with spiritual and religious pro gress, to broaden our world out- look and to develop our character.

Some day, when people will have matured spiri- tually, given up sensele ss struggle and their attempts to destroy the earth by means of atomic for ces, they will discover hitherto unanticipated means of space travel. Individuals will not use large flying saucers but small, to y-like models. Many will own such aircraft beca use these will be, in all probability, much cheaper than our present day automobiles.

However, for the pr esent their limits re- main a matter of conjecture, inasmuch as the effects of suction flight on the human body are still unknown and will have to be studied. Automobile and motorcycle races will become meaningless, for the reason that speed will have lost its m agic attraction. It can be taken for granted that the new methods of flight will affect politics. Instead of traveling, as today, by car or plane, people wi ll find it chea per to go by I mplo; thus the time is bound to come wh en borders will no longer be capable of stopping the thousands of vacatio n-bound travelers hurrying by implosion aircraft to sea shores and mounts in search of rest and relaxation.

As water at its death, as it were, consumes and devours its own fruit, so does the earth its own fruits. Whatever is born from it returns to it again, is swallowed up and lost, just as the time past is swallowed up by yesterday's days and nights, the light or darkness of which we shall never see again. It is no weightier to-day than yesterday, not even by a single grain, and will after a thousand years be of the same weight still. As it gives forth, so, in the same degree, it consumes. The death of the water, howev er, is in its own proper element, in that great terminus and centre of water, the sea, wherein the rivers, and what- ever else flows into it, die and are co nsumed as wood in the fire. Rivers, indeed, are not the element of water, but the fruit of that element, which is the sea; from this they derive their origin, and in this they receive both their life and their death.

While inventor Viktor Sc hauberger was per fecting his Implosion- Vacuum-Suction en gines in Vienna in the 1950s, Flying Saucer contac- tees were experiencing it at first hand! For George Adamski it was when he approached a landed Scout saucer on the California desert, Nov. 20, 1952. Well, not actually landed but pro ducing just enough lift to float off the ground. \"The ship was hoverin g above the ground, about a foot or two at the far side from me, and very near to the bank of the hill.

The three-ball landing gear was half lowered below the edge of the flange that covered them, and I had a feeling this was a precautionary act just in case they had definitely to land. Some of t he gusts of wind were pretty strong and caused the ship to wobble at times. When this to ok place the sun reflecting on the surface of t he ship caused beautiful prismatic rays of light to reflect out from it, as from a smoky diamond. This was observed, too, by the six others who maintained a steady watch from a distance. \"Nearing the ship I noticed a ro und ball at the very top that looked like a heavy lens of some kind. And it glowed. I wondered if it could be used as one e nd of a magnetic pole to draw their power from space as they were moving through it. . .

Dr. Petit says the imploding vortex works upwards \"causing gases to rush out through the top of the UFO. But remarkably, a m agnetic field pushes the gases downward along the cra ft's outer hull — providing lift\". At this point in time we can not resolve the contradiction.

Mr. Schauberger's son ignores requests from this continent. Mr. Brandstatter's wi dow offered assi stance, how- ever, and I wrote to the people she referred me to. Both Mr. Brandstatter and Mr. Schauberger are now dead. Victor Schauberger was a Forest Ranger before and after the First World War u nder Prince Schaumbe r-Lippe of Bavaria.

When he disturbed them with his cane they didn't dash to the side, but always went forwa rd into the curre nt.

This shabby treatment of the Austrian inventor proves that his Implosion motor was a threat to the established oil and nuclear power interests. So they murdered him with false promises, just as the Sick Industry broke the heart of Georges Lakhovsky in New York City in the ea rly 1940s, with a research program on his Multi-Wave Os cillator which deliberately went nowhere. RHC.) The Schauberger contract stated: - that all of his pat ents would become the property of a consortium managed by a Mr. Donner. - that any future inv entions or develop ments would also be owned by this consortium. - that he would refra in from discussing any of it with other parties. - that he would refrai n from publishing. - that all plans and models wo uld remain with the consor- tium. Like many inventors before him, Schauberger died poor, but his work and ideas are still alive. His son, Dip. Ing. Walter Schauberger, for one, is teaching about Schauberger's achieve- ments in his Pythagoras-Kepler School. Schauberger was a multi-faceted inventor. At the beginning of his career as a forest ranger he worked for a landowner whose young wife often went to the Riviera to play the casino at Monte Carlo. Always in need of money, her husband wanted to increase logging productivity. Oxen were th en used to transport logs. This was slow and expensive. Schauberger suggested floating them down the creeks instead. He estimated the cost reduction at 90%. Engineers declared this was impossible since oak and beech are heavier than water and cannot float. Schauberger knew his idea would work on cold winter nights if a spiral could be created in the flowing water, but that would have to be in a trough or flum e with laths of larchwood nailed May-June 1979 RR, Page 2 - 40 -"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"diagonally to implo de the flowing water. The heavy logs went forward like bulle ts shooting out of a ri fle. They twisted about their own axis without ever bumping against the walls of the trough, even at full capacity. THE SPIRAL MUST BE HARMONIOUS The spiral is su bject to bi- polarity. There are harmonious and inharmonious spiral s, the same as with melodies. A spiral is harmon- ious when its radii are divisible by a whole number, i.e., 1 for the first coil, 1/2 in the second coil, 1/3 in the third coil, etc. Nature uses egg shapes -- one of its secrets. But it works slow- ly. Applying th is principle would be inefficient in view of today's pollution and destruction. For this reason Schauberger wanted to speed up the natural processes. He ob- served that the planets orbit around the sun while at th e same time spin- ning on their own ax is. There is a double pattern as in waltzing. The spiral pipe incorporates this charac- teristic. It is conical and gener- ally egg-shaped except for an inner bend along one quarter of its circum ference. The shape causes the water to roll inwards under the action of the rotor on which the pipes are mounted. The manufacture of such a pipe was at first difficult; but a solution was eventually found: a sheet of copper was cut to the harmonious measure, bent in the shape of a pipe, welded along its length (emb odying, of course, the irregular ovoid men- tioned above). The impossible was made possible. We know that Nature uses the spiral in many ways: hurricanes, twisters, tornadoes, streams and ocean currents. The Tesla coil, for in- stance, seems to work through this principle, or perhaps works better because of it. When the last three inches of the secondary winding are ta- pered and conical, the May-June 1979 RR, Page 3 - 41 - "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"coil gives a better performance (e.g., the end where you attach the MWO antenna).

They carry transformers for Tesla coil 5000 Volt - 16 M Amp ($18.00) and plans and kits for Tesla coils and high voltage capacitors as well. VORTEX IN THE PYRAMID? Schauberger introduced us to implosion an d the centripetence force. Was he the first one to stumble upon this and put it to use? Chinese frugality is often chided by saying that anything that crawls in China eventually finds its way into the frying pan. Similarly, one could perhaps say that anything the Egypt- ians knew found its way into the Pyramid s. Were the spiral and centripetence forces also incorporated into the Pyramids, beside the Pi, the Phi and all the other mathematical data which has been discovered therein? Edward J. Kunkel, 295 W. Market St., Warren, Ohio 44481, says he has investigated almost ever y inch of the interior of the Great Pyramid. He suspected it was actually a giant ramp pump and that the pyramid was built by floating the blocks on barges on the rising water level in the interior of the Pyramid, as the name pyramid implies. In Greek, \"pyr\" means water, and \"amid\" means within. On page 30 of hi s self-published book, \"The Pharaohs' Pump\", Mr. Kunkel included a diagram of what is known as the well. He fe els certain this was the air com- bustion chamber for the ram pump, which system would have in- cluded all the other passages as well. According to Mr. Kunkel the shape of the well had the following effect: Air trapped near the small ceiling formed a cushion, and the moment a down- ward flow occurred, air pressure in the cell conversely became extremely high and, seeking relief, moved the water between the cell and the chamber, thus initiating the action which a moment later developed into a whirlpool. A model worked better with this cell than without it. Was it knowledge or accident? Inspired by what he found in the Great Pyrami d, Kunkel invented a ram pump and obtained a U.S. Patent on it. ISKUSIN AND ISKAD0R Dr. Rudolf Steiner, M.D., the founder of Anthroposophie, found that the sap of both summer and winter mistletoe made a good remedy against canc er when injected. He called it Iskador, He described cancer as a disorder of the cell structure for which summer and winter mistletoe, when used together, could work wonders because of their regulating ability. Furthermore, during the process there is a build-up of a sort of electrical energy as the drops fall; this electrical energy, although a side effect,' seems to be the main healing f orce.

Karl Roller, w ho was oriented to spiral force, reversed the process and used centripetal force which conserved the electrical proper ty of the medicine. He called the drug Is kusin. (Electricity cr eated by falling drops will be discussed later.) THE WATER WHIRL IN PRACTICE The pollution affecting the river Elbe in West Germany made it impossible for t he city of Hamburg to use it as a source of drinking water. D eep wells had to be drilled and it was found that the water contains carbonic acid which is corrosive and endangered the City's water sys tem. Carbonic acid can be neutralized with lime, at a ratio of 100 grams of lime to one cubic meter of water, or 6.6 tons of lime to 66,000 cm. of water, to be mixed during a 24-hour period. Lime and water were mixed spirally by a mixer, the upper portion of which had a saucer-like shape with a diameter of 83\" an d was 23 1/2\" deep. A whirling arm of 3 1/4\" diameter was driven by a motor. Not only did the centrip etal motion do all the mixing, but also reduced the need for lime by 50% in each well. The city uses six such mixers. THE GOLDEN PLOUGH Because of his experience with all kinds of water problems, Schauberger was nicknamed \"water magician\". He was onc e invited to Bulgaria in connection with the problem of farmland drying out. The Bulg arians were then u sing steam plows, the plough- shares being made of s teel. Strangel y enough, there was no dry- ing out in the old Turkish settlements where wooden ploughs were still being used. Could the material used for the plough- shares be the reason for the difference? Back home in Austria, Schauberger made experiments. His ploughshares were covered with copper plates. The result was surprising, up to 60% more harvest. New experiments show an increase of up to 100%. The use of steel has disadvantages; it has no magnetic per- meability. The earth magnetism gets cut and diverged. This creates turbulent energy fields, a ch aos; but more important is the grinding off of tiny steel particles because of the fast working methods of today. The fine steel dust combines with the oxygen. The result is oxidation and rust, which not only deprive the soil of s ome of its oxygen — at the same time kil- ling some of the m icro-organisms in th e soil — but also causes the groundwater to sink. In time the soil drys out. You can prove this by putting a sma ll quantity of rus t dust into water. This is sufficient to prevent falling drops from gener- ating electricity. Another experiment was used to p ut galvanic elements into May-June 1979 RR, Page 5 - 43 -"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"the ground. A copper plate was attached to one side of a con- tainer of water and a zinc plate to the other. This created an electric field, its radi ation saturated the su rrounding soil and the growth rate doubled. BACK TO MESMER It looks like we are back to Me smer's experiment! If put- ting copper and zinc plates in wate r creates electricity that improves the growth rate of plants in that area, what would this do to men and women? It would be interesting to experi- ment in a bathtub. Leave the plates in some water for a day or two to create a build-up, then just add some hot water to fill the tub at the desired temperature. Perhaps some of the Associates would like to participate in this experiment and share their impressions with us? A large technical co mpany in Germany p roduces garden tools made from copper and byrillium, made after Schauberger's dis- covery. So far they are being used only in private homes and nurseries. Copper-byri llium tools are not as hard as steel; there is more deterioration; but this is helpful as it puts trace minerals back into the soil and creates bio-electricity without which there is little growth. HOW IMPLOSION CAN IM PROVE YOUR SMILE Orthodontist, Prof. Dr. Baiters always disliked the ortho- dox methods used to straighten teeth and treat gum disorders. In his opinion, freeing the creativi ty and healing forces of the body is a much better solution. He consulted Schauberger in Linz, Austria to get an introduction to Implosion. Dr. Baiters successfully developed the Bionator, braces made of caoutchouc which work from behind the teet h and assume t he shape of the desired correction. The patient can rem ove the Bionator at will. It uses the implosion vacuum caused by the free flow of saliva and the suction of the gum. THE WATER TORNADO IN ACTION A motor turns the co nical rotor in the m iddle of the tower. The pipes are mounted with the larg er opening on the rotor. The smaller end, with the jet in it, reaches almost to the wall on which a wavy steel ring is positioned. When the rotor with the pipes turns, the centrifugal for ce presses the water out through the jets against the wavy or rippled steel ring, which causes a recoil and relieves the motor. The centrifugal force in the winding pipes creates a suction on the bottom part and so make an almost perpetual moveme nt. The Air Model works the same way, only upside down. The Schauberger Biotechnic Ltd. in Switzerland manufactures an air purifier. A v entilator blows the poll uted air into the May-June 1979 RR, Page 6 - 44 -"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"egg-shaped housing. The Air rolls itself in and compressed at the bottom. Beneath the egg shape is a container with water, connected to the hou- sing with a pipe. When the whirl is created, the water rises from the bottom through the pipe and mixes with the air, cleaning it. The clean air leaves through the top and the water flows back down depositing the dirt on the bottom. FIRE IN THE WATER \"It is true that science has not yet solved the riddle of the water- jet, but Schauberger;should not tell such fairy tales as t hat rolling peb- bles in water disperse sparks which make the Rhine rive r glow at night. That makes it hard to take such a man seriously.\" Such remarks were often made when someone discussed Schauberger's theories. Prof. Dr. Zimmerman heard it often and, when visit ing Schauberger, talked about it. Schauberger laughed, took two pebbles out of a drawe r, filled a pail with common tap water and moved to a darker corner of the r oom. As he rolled the stones against one another in the water, Dr. Zimmerman could observe the flying sparks which had the same force as if it had been done in the air. Cold light: it was almost as in a fairy tale. \"Once in Yugoslavia it failed,\" May-June 1979 RR, Page 7 - 45 -"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"said Schauberger. \"I had in mind to demonstrate this to a group of unbelievers, got the pebbles out of the river, but got no sparks. Then it dawned on me the stones had been on a long journey along the rive r bed and had lost their power. Take only pebbles from a mountain or the upper part of the river; better st ill, break the stones and use both halves.\" Friction creates heat in the water as in the air. To create sparks, oxygen is needed and we find oxygen in water as well as in air. The legend about the glowing Rhine river may not be a fairy ta le after all. When th e strong river cur- rent pushed the rocks downstream, and the stones bumped against each other, then in the darkness of the night the dispersing of the sparks could be clearlv seen (the water in those days was still clear and unspoiled;. Today, after grading the river bed and its shores, the polluted water has lost its magic. IS THE HOME POWER PLANT NEAR? In different places in Austria and Germany, tests are being done with great enthusiasm on home power plant models. The greatest obstruction has been finding ways to construct the shape of the spiral pipes. This problem has now been sol- ved with an accuracy and ease that were not possible in Schau- berger's time. Firs t, a wooden model was made. The profile of the outside will be the profile of the inside of the pipe. To achieve this, the wooden model has a two-piece form adjus- ted around it in some flexible material. After the material has hardened, the model will be t aken out and wax poured in its place. The wax core will then have the shape of the wooden model and requires special handling. First, it will be covered with a kind of epoxy or some- thing similar in which powdered copper has been mixed. The second coat is made of layers of fibreglass tapes to reinforce it since it will be the wall of the pipe. Another coat of epoxy or other strong material finishes the product. After all coats have hardened a little heat makes the wax flow out and the spiral pipe is complete d. And what is the status of power plants in America? ONE MILLION WATTS WITH A TORNADO MACHINE Victor Schauberger's friends have no t forgotten the bad experience he had in the U.S. Since his plans and models re- mained here, they keep a watchful eye across the Big Pond for any news about related inventions. Special attention was given to a newspaper report about an American engineer who suggested using wind energy by creating a man- made whirlwind in a silo- like tower. Ing. James Yen, working for the Grumman Aerospace corporation, estimates that a turbine of only six feet in dia- meter could deliver two million watts. It would take a conven- tional turbine measuring 200 feet in diameter to produce the May-June 1979 RR, Page 8 - 46 -"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"same results T he silo-like tower is steady, has an open top and is open on one side. Th e wind enters the tower through the wing-like openin g, starts a whirl a nd this, in turn, reduces the atmospheric pressure in the center. A vacuum is created, forcing air through the turbine. The sucked air makes it spin. Mr. Yen expects much from the comparably small turbine. Experiment s in wind chan nels confirm his theory. He is confident that it wou ld be possible to build whirlwind generators with a ca pacity of 100 and ev en 1000 megawatts. Let us hope the atomic age is over soon!

Their motto was: \"Fidus In Silvis Silentibus\" (L oyalty to the silent for est). As the last of the Schauberger robber knights were captured, the older one was beheaded and the younger one pardoned and exiled into the wild, deep forest. He settled on the Plockenstein l ake in the Austrian mountains, and his descendants supplied an unbroken line of gamekeepers, fish- ermen and forest rangers . They knew the healing power of water and the way to build irrigation ditches for nighttime use only as a me- thod of improving yields in their fields . Even today after a storm, torrential streams lay bare an old creek bed as a witness to the art and technique the Schaubergers used to build sluices for the trans- portation of logs. Their method forced the water to flow first to the left then to the right, in sinuous spirals. The expressio n \"zykloids\" was un- known to them, yet they ingeniously used thi s principles Through this rhythmical change of curves the log s moved in the sluice faster than the water itself and, in some places, against the law of gra- vity, even uphill! \"Since my childhood I wanted to be a forest ranger. After the first world war, I was able to g et such a position with the Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe. He was a good man to work f or, but like others in those days, the Prince had financial problems. I had submitted my plan for building a new kind of sluice to bring down the cost of transporting logs to the Management of the estate. I was rejected with the argument that beech and oak are heavier than water and, according to Archimedes' law, cannot float. \"On a hunting trip with the Princess , I told her ab out her hus- band's problems. The Princess came from a humble ba ckground. She understood the situation, listened to my plan, and decided it might help to save the estate. She knew about the attempt by the company who did the hauling to bribe me. She stopped and asked, 'How much did the company offer you?' I replied, 'Three times my yearly salary.' \" 'And how much could be saved w ith your new way of transporta- tion?' \" 'Today a cord of wood costs 12 schillings and 30 thousand cords March-April 1983 RR, Page 14 - 48 -"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"are moved in a year. That amounts to 360 thousand schillings.' \" 'How much would the cord cost with the new system?' \" 'One schilling, including amortization of the construction,' was my answer. The Princess agreed. The only cond ition I asked for was to have a free hand in the co nstruction, taking all responsibility. A COMBINATION OF VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL CURVES \"After four months th e sluice was finished and an enormous pile of wood stood at the ready. We made the attempt. A moderately heavy log was the first to go. It floated down about 300 feet and got stuck with the fo rce of the water pushing it out of the channel. The workers were grinning. I sent them home, and sat down by the pond to gather my thoughts. Sud denly I felt a movement against my leg. I catapulted it into the pond wi th my cane and wa tched it cross the pond. Then, it hit me: how can a snake propel itself through the water without any fins? I st udied its every move with my bino- culars. It was turning and twisting in a c ombination of vertical and horizontal curve s. I kept this picture in my mind till it be- came clear to me. \"I recalled the workers and gave them new directions. One went for nails, the other for lathes of larchwood. I promised them double pay for finishing the Job, by tor chlight if necessary. It took all night to nail the lathe s diagonally into the trough, es- pecially in the curves as suggested by the m ovements of the snake. \"When I returned home a letter was waiting fo r me. The prince, his wife and a building expert w ould be at the sluice to examine it by 10 o'clock the next mornin g. When they arrived I saluted the prince and chief forester, but igno red the guest. The gate was opened, the workers started pushing some medium-sized logs into the trough, leaving the larger ones aside. \" 'No, no,' said the chief fores ter, 'take that one.' I nod- ded my assent. Slowly th e heavy log entered the sluice gate and blocked it, causing the water to rise. No one said a word. All eyes hung on the log expecting t he rising water to overflow at any moment. Suddenly, there was a gurgling sound; the heavy log turned first right, then left, then twisting like a snake, floated past with its front end up in the air to finally disappear smoothly around the next bend. The float-master took the chewing tobacco out of his mouth and said, 'Kiss my _____, it works!' \"I took my rifle and went into t he forest. Once out of sight, I sat down on a stump with t he rifle and cane between my legs, wiping the cold swe at off my forehead. Neve r again, I thought. Had I not had the encounter with the sn ake at a most fo rtuitous moment, I would not be alive today. (Probably failure would have driven Schauberger to suici de, not uncommon in his d ay and circumstances.) \"After a few days I was informed that I would henceforth be managing the entire forest. Experts and specialists started to visit March-April 1983 RR, Page 15 -49 -"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"us, even the Secretary of State. Soon afterwards I was appointed to the Department of Agriculture in V ienna. From the day I promised the Princess to build that sluice I never had any peace! \"The sluice came very near not to being built at all, however. The chief forester came to me one day with an order to stop construc- tion on the dam. I had to show my plans and explain them, as no one could believe that the 55 foot high dam coul d hold the w ater. Every- one was afraid that it would collapse under the pressure due to the weakness of the walls. Eventually, I realized the r eal intention was to prevent construction of the sluice. THE MOMENT OF TRIUMPH \"I walked over to the middle of the dam and fired both barrels of my rifle upstream. Th is was the signal for an assistant stand- ing above to open the gate and l et the water in. The Commissioners thought I had lost my mi nd and had prefe rred to use my rifle than to answer their questions. Suddenly there was a roar. I pointed up- stream wherefrom a mass of brown water 18 feet high came down blar- ing and carrying wood, stumps and chunks of turf with it. \"'Good heavens, come here quickly!' shouted o ne of the men. Others were gesticulating wildly with their arms. I only gave them a quick glance, then bent down over the 'weak' wall against which the onrushing waters were supposed to smash any moment. The water did no such thing, however. On the contrary, the impact was weak and the first wave rebo unded back uphill against t he oncoming, stream which caused the logs to stand up almost verti cally, jumping out of the water like fish. The basin, of almost a million cubic yard ca- pacity, was quickly filled. \"No one had the nerve to come do wn to me on the dam, so I went up to them. 'Well,' remarked the District Commissioner, 'more luck than brain.' \"'I think it's the other way around,' said I. I emptied my rifle and walked away. The group had a short discussion after which we were informed that there would be an inspection by experts from Vienna, even though the dam seemed to hold — but surely not for long! One week later the experts arrived and stated, after an extensive inspection, that the dam had a factor of 12 safety. In spite of their calculations they were puzzled by many questions. I had the basin filled once more to give them a demonstration. As the water came in I pointed out its behavior, that is how it re- coiled against itself thereby breaking i ts own momentum. The idea for the shape of the dam had come not from technical books or schools but from your everyday chicken egg! \"On my first Job as a graduate forester I spent my spare time at a mountain lake fishing or duck hunting from a boat. My greatest wish was to shoot the giant fish eagl e. Every evening he circled high over the water, sud denly falling down li ke a rock. The next moment he would be up and away with large fish in his claws. How he could catch fish without touching the water was a mystery.

Equipped with good binoculars I took up position in a tall tree on the hig hest side of the lake, from where I could keep a watchful eye on bo th the eagle and the fish in the lake. A PYRAMID OF SPIRALS \"Almost at the same moment, the eagle appeared. He circled with loud screams over the spot where the fish was, flying low and clapping its wings strongly as if trying to attract attention to itself. Next, it rose almost vertically in ever decreasing spirals. Then, it let itself fall like a rock, legs e xtended, toward the fish. As it reached the water it broke its fall with a strong flap of the wings and, the next moment, was holding a large fish in its claws* Heavily laden it flew toward the forest and disappeared. I was so fascinated I only paid attention to the bird, but promised myself that next time I would pay attention to the fish. \" The eagle came back, an nouncing his arrival lo udly as usual, and drew his ever decreasing spiral upon recovering altitude. What happened next was so unbelievable that I lost my balance and almost fell out of the tree for having imitated what I saw. Fish in the lake were spiralling upward just li ke the bird abov e! They were one after the other, like pearls on a string, coming always closer to the surface. Because the spiral was becoming smaller, some of the fish were crowded to gether which caused th eir first dorsal fins to protrude from the water. A dark shadow fell over the spot, a little flash, and the eagle took off with its prey. NEUTRALIZING GRAVITY WITH LENTICULAR FLOW \" It was spawning time. I took my post, on a clear moonlight night, close to a waterfall hoping to ca tch a fish poacher. I could see every move of the fish in the crystal-clear water. Suddenly, the fish moved toward th e sides. A very large trout had come up- stream. It swam along the fall as if in search of something, its motion like a winding dance, then finally disappeared beneath what looked like a sheet of glimmering metal under the moonlight. I noticed there was a whirlpool at the foot of the narrowing water- fall. The trout floated out of this vortex and up the waterfall as if drawn by an invisible force. \"Once at the crest, it was pushed out of the water and landed a few yards upstream. I was so excited by wha t I had seen I forgot all about the poacher and went home to think about it. I saw this phenomenon many times after that, but no scientist could give me an explanation. \"Later in the same winter I shot an alpine goat across a deep ravine. It slipped and fell down into t he ravine. I could hear it bouncing over the ice on the frozen river below. I was unhappy about this as I expected the horns to be broken. Slowly I made my way down the icy slope. To my pleasurable surprise the goat was in- tact and dry.

I watched them sink and noticed some movement between the stones on the bottom. Al though some were size of a man's head, they moved to and fro as if they were electrically charged. Defying the laws of gravity they went from side to side as if alter- natively attracted and repulsed by one another. I began to doubt my own eyes as a stone the size of a man's head spun then floated upward. It was egg-shaped. \"The next moment it was floating on the surface surrounded by a ring of open water and tossing gently. There followed another and another, until most of the egg-shaped stones were floating. Only the smooth, ovoid s tones had this proper ty, the angular ones remained motionless at the bottom. My first thought was that they must be electrically charged as this phenomenon reminded me of the light which appears under water when milky h ued pebbles rub against each other. \"I didn't know at that time that a number of forces were at work to create a light effect as well as overcome the laws of gravity to bring these stones to the sur face. I crossed the newly formed bridge and went home. Years later I learned that the Ankara river which originates in Lake Baikal in Central Russia is the site of a similar phenomenon, which makes it possi ble for the local farmers to cross the river in winter. A LAKE RECREATES ITSELF \"Remarkable phenomena ca n be observed on the Lakes of Desolation in the Hartzau valley of Austria, after a long hot spell. I was sitting on the shore of such a lake on a hot day wondering whether to go for a swim when I noticed that the water started to move in a circle. Trees which had been imbedded in the sand after a landslide were pulled loose and ca rried away by the merr y-go-round. As the speed of the circling water incr eased, the floating debris moved closer and faster toward the middle of the lake. Once they reached the center, the trunks t ilted upward and were su cked in with great force so the shores were cleaned like a peeled banana -- or like people whom a cyclone sets back down on earth almost naked. None of the trees resurfaced. \"Shortly afterward the lake calme d down. T his, however, was only the calm before the stor m. The bottom of the lake started rum- bling and suddenly a spout as high as a house shot up out of its center with a thundering noise, spinning upon it self and overflowing from the top like a fountain. A short while later th e spout collap- sed sending waves to splash against the shore. I had witnessed the renewal of a lake devoid of fresh water tributaries. Here ends Viktor Schauberger's p ersonal report. His discoveries represent only a fraction of the many ways Mother Nature uses a spiral combined with an egg shape. The expression \"the egg of Col- umbus\" should be \"the egg of Viktor Schauberger. After all, Colum- bus made the egg stand, but Scha uberger made the egg outstanding!

To many scientists it is now obvious that the uterus, because of its shape, is sucking the egg through the Fall opian tube and n ot, as believed by orthodoxy the Fallopian tube conve ying it downward. S imilarly, William Har- vey's theory of 1618 that the heart is pumping the blood through the body no longer holds water. Some medical scientists recognized long ago that the bloo d is making the heart contract and not vice versa. This was corrobo rated as far back as 189 2 by Dr. Karl Schmidt and 1927 by Dr, Martin Mendelson, by cardiologists Harlicek in 1937 and Genta in 1958, as well as Dr. W. Simonis in 1970. Everyone knowledgeable about the function of the heart realizes how little it can be compared with a pump. Embryologie teaches that there is at first a primary fluid cir- culation within the tissue of the embryo and, much later, the heart starts to form. The tender card iac valves have only a thickness of .15 mm Hg (about 4 inches of m ercury); they are comp letely passive; there is no sign of an active pu mp. Suction, because of the egg shape, does most of the work, or better, implosion. It is a kind of ram pump and no more. The Japanese, K. Nishi, points o ut that the red blood cells could never be pushed through the fine capillaries since some of them have a much small er diameter than the red blood cells them - selves. Amending the theory concerning the fu nctioning of the heart would lead to better diagnosis and therapy. A HEART-LIKE CONTAINER Dr. Karl Roller had a problem mixing drugs. He did not want to apply centrifugal force. Schauberger, whom he consulted, suggested that the li quid be shaken instead of the container. \"You have to build a heart-like container with a small, two-armed propeller on the bottom. Then you have the reversed move- ment.\" Replied Roller, \"But then you'll have a centrifugal force again.\" \"Yes,\" said Scha uberger, \"but that will bring into play a suction in the middle of the container.\" It shouldn't be necessary to have the propeller built into the bowl; one drive n by an electric drill, like that used to stir paint should do. Dr. Roller remembered an experiment made by Dr. Rudolph Steiner on conserving plant juice without alcohol by using rhythm on rose petals and distilled water in a heart-shaped bowl, and having his wife swirl the contents to create a whirlpool, each morning and evening.

We have been taught that what goes up must come down and that there is no escape from gravity. But is it so? Gravity can only be efficacious where the envelope around the object, air or water, is lighter or thinner than the matter itself. Any obje ct will start to hover as you compress, that is, condense, it s envelop e. This is where Arch- imedes' law comes in. If we put an egg in a glass of water it will sink to the bottom. Now add salt to the water and when the salt is dissolved, the egg rises and surfaces. Where is the gravity effect? The water surrounding the egg has become more dense. The envelope can be saturated in more than one way to achieve uplifting. For example, on a cold winter night the water in mountain streams is cold and that makes it dense. When Dr. Jarl, M.D. studied at Ox ford he had the friendship of a Tibetan student. Year s later, during a journe y to Egypt, he met his old friend again and was inv ited to spend some time in Tibet, which he did. One day his friend took him to a place near a clois- ter where construction was in progress. In a steep cliff, 250 me- tersabove ground there was a cave. Monks were busy building a wall on a small plateau in front of the cave. The spot could only be reached from the t op of the cliff with the help of a rope. On the ground below lay a smooth, flat stone with a depression in its center, one meter acro ss by 15 centi- meters deep. A stone block about 1x1 1 /2 meters was put in the bowl. At a distance of 63 meters from the bowl 19 musical instruments (ragdongs) were placed side by side in a 90° a rc The radius of 63 meters had been carefully measured. Th e instruments consisted of 13 drums and 6 trumpets. Eight of the drums were 1 meter wide and 1.5 meters long. Four were medium-s ized, 0.7x1m. The only small one was 0.2x0.3m. They were made from thick sheet metal, 3mm thick, weighed 150 Kg each a nd one end was open. Behind the instruments stood a row of monks, as shown in the drawing on the next page.

The instruments made a loud noise and the monks sang a mantra. For the first four min- utes nothing happened. The tempo increased and suddenly the stone started to sway. Then the block shot upward with increasing speed toward the opening. Three minutes later it landed on the plat- form. Whenever a pro- jected stone split it it was thrown back by the monks above. Within an hour it was possible to lift 5 or 6 stones up to the 2 50m level in a 500m long parabolic curve. CENSORSHIP FROM THE BRITISH MIRO Dr. Jarl had heard about the Tibetan stone raising. Others, like Linauer, Spalding and Father Huc spoke about it. At first Jarl thought it was a sort of hypnotic trick; then he made movies of the anti-gravity phenomenon; but the British company Dr. Jarl worked for declared the movies their property and they were not to be disclosed until 1990 when, after 50 years, they shall be released.

A wire led from the container to an elec- troscope. When a paraffin plate was held in an angle a short distance from the thin water thread, the electro- meter registered a charge of 10,000 volts!

He was fascinated by f lying and even more by the gliding of birds high in the sky with no obvious physical effort. He also observed a similar phenomenon in mountain streams where trouts could stand motionless in a strong current, and, if dis- turbed, would shoot, li ke an arrow, not to one side, but strait ahead into the stream. Did he ever find an explanation? There are other phenomena as well. Rivers in some places in Europe literally fl ow up hill. On e sich river is in the Tatra Mountains located in the Balkas. On a stretch of 15 Kilometers the river climbs 64 meters. Reports in the media about such striking occurrences are ignored by science, because no expla- nation can be given, and deeper investigation might result in a collapse of the well e stablished \"Law of Gravity\". In the opinion of Viktor S chauberger such phenomena as climbing rivers is related to the motions of birds and trouts and its explanation could revolu tionize our scie nce and if prop- erly handled, co uld cut energy cost to almost nothing. THE TRANSFORMING MEDIUM OF WATER In his view, science made a big mistake by describing water as H 2 O. If water could be pu t into a formula, it should read: Water is an ideal medium for transformation into an accumulator or transformer, and only the way it is moved determines whether it will be magnetic or electric. Such currents are of organic origin and decompose water into its basic substance (Hydrogen - Carbon - Oxygen) H-C-O. Under certain conditions, its carbon (C) unites with the oxygen (O) to form organic electrici ty. The freed hydrogen (H) shoots upward, spinning, attracting and absorbing the missing C & O from its environment and forms water again.

The remaining 996 hp. are free energy. This phenomenon is based on thermoelectric forces such as in cyc lones or tornadoes wh ich can be observed. Such implosion processes can be duplicated in small machines that give enormous power. Similar reactions take place in the lungs of birds and in the gills of fish. The absorbed air or water touches organic catalysts which diffuse it; the split-off hydrogen acts like a magnet on the carbon and oxygen surounding it, diffusing it in such a manner that in fro nt of the opening of a machine, or the mouth of a bird or fish, the pressure sink s below 100 mm, leaving a vacuum which will push an airpla ne, bird or fish, forward. The disaster in the thirties of the American airship, \"Acron,\" and the German airship, \"Hindenburg,\" have probably been caused by di ffusion of their gases. The Ac ron was filled with helium and its diffusion causes rain, where as hydrogen turns into fire(Hindenburg). An anal ogue to the helium syn- thesis can be found in the natural p rocess of rain.

I can only reply in the words of a famous scientist, \"Ideas come out of space!\" The idea, upon which my work has been based, is as follows: \"That it is possible to induce rainfall, as it touches the earth, to commence to move towards specially prepared focal points, where it will commence to spiral d ownwards, to replenish underground streams and centres of moving water, beneath the earth's surface; instead of streaming off, on. or near, the surface of the land; filling the surface water channels far too rapidly and causing mud and floods to make their appearance.\" ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE - This idea was quickly followed by the amazing discovery that the idea had evidently been in t he minds of the anci ent agricultur- ists, who first brought these islands (British Isles) to fertility, out of swamp and forest! Not only here, in this Glouceste rshire valley, but all over England, and in parts of Wales too, there are to be found the neces- sary earthworks and the chequer-board pattern of field and pasture, which are parts of the System; a lthough, now, completely prevented from functioning by the application of modern ideas of Land Drainage. Modern Drainage increases the rate of surface run-off, and pre- vents the far more rapid inward rotational movement. No puddles form where inward rotation of water is functioning; and in such areas there is no mud! Earth and water become permanently dissociated and air takes the place of stagnant water in the soil, wherever rainwater is allowed ot percolate the earth with a natural inward spiral move- ment. This action can be induced by man, and adapted in accordance with his needs. The radiesthetist will be, it se ems certain, most interested in that part of the discovery which is connected with the incidence 61"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"of disease; and of the effects on disease which follow the introduc- tion of this method of Land Wate r Control in any given area. NEW LIFE IN THE VALLEY In Farts of this valley, where I hav e not yet been permitted to set the System working, many dead and dying trees are to be seen. In areas where the ancient focal spots have been once more set to work, the diseased limbs, and the cankered bark of the trees, have all been shed, or smothered in new, healthy growth. The corky excrescences which covered the twigs and branches of of the elm trees, immediately began to shrivel up, and then to drop off, once the water of an area h ad started to move spirally inwards. Where, before, there were diseased growths, now there may be seen shining, healthy tissue, full of lenticels and growing at a rapid pace. The elm leaves may have been not much bigger than one's thumb nail, but now there will come, on the younger elm branches, large, tender, bright green leaves, which might be mistaken for nut leaves. Willow trees - old and pollarded - may have been falling apart, riddled with the tiny holes of parasites. Now \"new trees\" will take their place. The splits are actually mended by new tissue which grows rapidly up the edges of th e split portions, reuniting them and enabling the tree to take on the appearance of a new one, as new bark covers the whole area in succeeding years. In our valley, the wate rside rushes, which, formerly, grew for awhile and then turn ed yellow and d ied away, now grow right up to flower and fruit! As for the rushes in the boggy valley pastures - where are they? The little acre known as \"Poor Land\" or the \"Parish Field,\" which I rent from the Parish Council, was, when I took it over, in January 1939, a mass of rushes and water weeds. Some, then called it \"Rushy Meadow.\" Now, there is not a rush to be seen! The rushes have been grazed to extinction by my farm animals, which, previously would eat but little of the sour herbage of this low lying pasture; which, nearly every winter, disappears for a while under many feet of Severn floods, which sweep across the three-mile-wide Valley; which is believed to hav e been, in previous days \"less subject to waters.\" (vide the 16th century historian Leland). THE HUMAN LINK What place have human beings in this long-forgotten System, which I have re-discovered? We have no \"roots\" like plants. We, and the animals, move from place to place. We, and they, may gain great benefit from eating produce which is obviously more healthy; from the new-textured, sweet-smelling, and rich ly-coloured soil which is now to be seen wherever the System is working. - 62 -"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Is there more than this? I think there is. In this System, allowance is made for tidal movements in the waters of the earth - the ryt hmic \"back-and-forth\" of free water, which may be observed on the surface of the sea, but which, manifestly, cannot en d at the sea shore. This movement must extend throughout the earth's surface, and outwards into space, also. Much is written regarding the \"stress\" of modern times. I am convinced that much of this stress is connected with that unremitting onward \"forward- traction\" of the waters of the country- side - as though the \"a teries\" of the earth had been severed, while the \"veins\" had long since ceased to function! COSMIC INTERCONNECTIONS I look upon the Moon as having a similar function with regard to the Earth, as the Heart of ma n has with regard to his Body. In this connection, it is interesting to no te that the Ancient Chaldeans of Ur, (who, it seems probable, unde rstood the principles which I have rediscovered) accounted the \"Goddess of Fertility\" to be none other than \"Nin-Gal\" the God dess of the Moon! There should be, I am convinced, (by practical experiment) a possibility for the earth's waters to draw back and fo rth, as well as on and on! It also seems probable to me, th at cosmic rays, coming out of space, need a healthy , and balanced en- vironment in which to work naturally, - and therefore be neficiently in the ser- vice of mankind.

We know you are right, but - the Ministry of Agricul ture says that all rivers and streams must flow straight to the sea; and dams of earth and stone are not permissible, according to modern drainage ideas!\" In our gardens, we may begin, however. That circular flower bed is the focal point. Make it, first, a \"saucer,\" - a depression - made firm with a few stones in the centre. Then, on the \"saucer,\" place a mound of earth. In the surface of this m ound you will set your plants and seeds. Mound it as high as p ossible by adding humus to lighten the soil. Mound your flower bord ers also. Never let them be flat. Air pres- sure will then drive the rainfall towards the \"cores\" of the flower beds and flower borders. Thence it will spiral downwards. You will have started inward rotation* In tim e, no doubt, others will follow! \"For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and re- turneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater* \"So shall My Word be that goeth forth out of My Mouth; it shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. \"For ye shall go out w ith joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into a singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands* \"Instead of the thorn sh all come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the Lord for a Name, for an everlasting sign, that shall not be cut off.\" (The ideas of the author have some resemblance to those of Dr. Schauberger but were ev olved separately over a period of years.

It only became known after the war, th at aircraft resembling Schauberger's prototype had been further developed in several other production workshops. The most informative data about th is is without doubt the report by Hermann Klaas, an engineer from Muhlheim in the Ruhr, who had collaborated on the plans and who at the time had published a detailed report, complete with photocopies of sketches and original documents, in the Wuppertal paper, Bergische Wochenpos t (ceased publication): \"I still have drawings of a model \"flying disc\" which I built in 1941; perfected by the Germans, in all truth this invention flew with almost unbeliev able success. It had a diameter of 2.4 metres with a sma ll, very fast runni ng special electric motor (there were no petrol-engined models at that time), which had been \"obtained\" by courtesy of th e Luftwaffe. It climbed st raight up into the air so suddenly that unfortunately it hit th e workshop ceiling and crashed to the ground in pieces. The model which actually flew can be seen in the accompanying pictures (shown on p. 94) and also those versions begun firstly in Bohemia and later in Breslau (where the Miethe group worked), which embodied a stronger ramjet-pipe (like the VI rockets). The three models approximate the Ballenzo-Schriever-Habermohl prototype, even as far as the incorporation of the jet nozzles. The jets must be able to swivel in order to achieve the \"colloidal effect\", which enables the \"f lying disc\" to climb vertically (Miethe built better models later on). On the first model, and also on the other models, the outer rim, made of high- grade metal alloys, was solid (without vents). When this disc had gained height or had attained the desired altitude so that the thrust from the rear exhaust nozzles began to take effect, the disc transferred from vertical to horizontal flight Naturally this control system was not simple. It was only on later designs that the \"slotted rim\" was incorporated, so that the jets could be swivelled in all directions. These flying discs are today being built not only in the West, but also in the U.S.S.R. There was, of course, a whole range of further designs, though unfortunately no entirely completed pr ototypes. In the beginning neither 65"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Miethe nor Habermohl could get hold of a simple jet pipe. It could only be \"supplied\" via the agency of a Luftwaffe sergeant\" The \"Flying Saucers\" of the Third Reich Years later, on the 27 th July 1956, the Munich periodical Das Neue Zeitalter published an article headed \"Hitler built Flying Saucers\" ... \"The Austrian forester Viktor Schauberger was the inventor and discoverer of this new motive power - implosion, which, with the use of only air and water, generated light, heat and motion. In the implosion-motor a diamagnetism was developed which made the lifting power possible By means of a suction screw-impeller, which revolved from the outside towards the inside along a cvcloid spiral space-curve, the same force is generated which creates waterspouts, typhoons, cyclones or hurrica nes through the effect of suction. Qn the 19th February 1945 near Prague , the first test of an unmanned \"flying disc\" took place. In three mi nutes it climbed to a height of 15,000 metres and attained a horizontal speed of 2,200 km/h; it could hover motionless in the air and could fly as fa st backwards as forwards- This \"flying disc\" had a diameter of 50 metres.\" On the 14th of August 1956, volume 31, th e Munchener Illustrierte printed an article in which engineer Rene C ouzinet's wooden model was displayed, whose external appearance was similar to Schauberger's design. Apparently, however, Couzinet was still far from achieving a working model, for Schauberger commented on the article in a letter dated 11/8/56 as follows: \"One look (at the model) told me that the man is still miles away from the achievement of diamagnetic levitati on power, for Couzinet has probably employed the effect of direct suction, whereas Nature uses indirect, i.e. reactionary suction force ... what various papers have published is also incorrect, namely that I might have copied typhoons, cyclones, etc, which occur in warm zones.\" It should be noted in passing, that judicial circles in West Germany and abroad have posed the question as to whether Hitler was able to flee to safety in such an aircraft at th e end of the war. In any case, it is a proposal put forward in Mattern's book, UFO - The Ultim ate Secret Weapon of the Third Reich. A book by Rudolf Lusar enti tled German Weapons and Secret Weapons of the 2nd World War and their Furt her Development, now in its fourth edition, was published in 1962 by J.F. Lehmann in Muni ch. In it the author dedicated a whole chapter to the \"flying saucers\" of the Third Reich, wherein it was stated: \"The development, which had cost millions, was almost complete by the end of the war. No doubt the exis ting models were destroyed, although the plant in Breslau, where Miethe worked, fell into the hands of the Russians, who removed all the material and technical personnel to Siberia, where further work on these \" flying sau cers\" has been carried on with much success. Schriever just managed to get out of Prague in time, Habermohl, on the other hand, must be in the Soviet Union. The former German designer Miethe is in the USA and, as far as can be determined, is designing \"flying saucers\" for A. V. Roe & Co. The m achines, which have been observed to date, have diameters in the order of 16, 42, 45 and 75 metres and they are supposed to develop a speed of up to 7,000 km/h. Already in 1952 \"flying saucers\" had been indisputably recognised over Korea and according to 66"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"press reports, were also observed a nd reported during NATO manoeuvres in Alsace in the spring of 1954.\" The magazine Hobby took up the theme again in its 26th issue and quipped with the headline \"When sau cers learned to fly\", whereas a company newspaper made reference to \"Secret Service Cases\". In addition, we have been presented with many ot her publications on this theme, some of which are highly interesting, in which there is no lack of amazing references to design drawings and models supposed to have fallen into Allied hands at the end of the war. It would indeed require a hard-working and consci entious chronicler to sift through such a profusion of data. But, as the old saying goes, \"There is no smoke without fire'. Through the information supplied us by Walter Schauberger, which has provided us with much documentary evidence, much of the above will be made clear. We would, however, like to keep a certain distance from comments whic h reflect only isolated opinions. Everyone can draw his own conclusions fr om such views as have here been quoted. In connection with many such reflections, a letter written by Viktor Schauberger to a friend on the 2nd August 1958 is very informative. The following are extracts: \"The 'flying sa ucer' which was flight-tested on the 19th February 1945 near Prague and whic h attained a height of 15,000 metres in 3 minutes and a horizontal sp eed of 2,200 km/h, was constructed according to a model I built at Ma uthausen concentration camp in collaboration with the first-class engi neers and stress-analysts assigned to me from the prisoners there. It was onl y after the end of the war that I came to hear, through one of the workers under my direction, a Czech, that further intensive development was in progress: howeve r, there was no answer to my enquiry. From what I understand, just before the end of the war, the machine is supposed to have been destroyed on Keitel's orders. That's the last I heard of it In this affair, several armament specialists were also involved who appeared at the works near Prague, shortly before my return to Vienna, and asked that I demonstrate the fundamental basis of it: The creation of an atomic low-pressu re zone, which (develops in seconds when either air or water is caused to move radially and axially under conditions of a falling temperature gradient.\" The USA Intervenes Particularly instructive is another letter by Schauberger to the same friend dated 23rd January 1958. \"An American aircraft consortium offered me $3,500,000 to divulge the secret of the UFO. to thr ee of their experts. A similar offer was made by Canadian interests. Both groups wanted to come here to see everything ... I answered . . . un til the signing of an internationally valid provisional agr eement, nothing would be demonstrated. (These gentlemen, however) wanted to see first and sign later, which I categorically rejected. From the Germans it was suggested that I should secredy act as consultant on two major government projects for which I was to receive a commensurate fee. I declin ed, because I did not want the secrets to be drawn out of me and then, as al ways happened before, to receive a kick in the pants...

I will have nothing whatsoever to do with such bankrupts.\" Despite these misgivings, discussions with Bonn did, in the end, take place. Essential to these discussions, inter alia, was the conditions that investigations into the hydraulic proc esses resulting from Schauberger's research and development, including the evaluation of earlier experiments, were to be verified on a stricdy scie ntific basis by expert opinion from the Stuttgart Institute of Technology (Technische Hochschule Stuttgarts). This report by experts was published ve rbatim in the quarterly magazine Komische Evolution, which regularly publishes the results of the latest scientific research in the sphere of Scha uberger's theories and findings. While discussions with Bonn were s till under way, tw o representatives from the \"Washington Iron Works\" su ddenly appeared at Schauberger's home: Messrs Karl Gerchsheimer from Texas and Norman Dodd from New York. During the American Occupation, Gerchsheimer was the US plenipotentiary for Wurzburg. He spoke fluent German with a Bavarian accent \"We are here on behalf of a large American corporation whose spokesman is Robert Donner from Colorado. It is desired that Schauberger's ideas and findings be translated into fact as soon as possible in the USA. Money is available in unlimited quantity.\" 650 Million Dollars for \"Project Implosion\" Later on it became known that the 650 million dollars was supposed to have been the first installment of the co mmitted capital, notably at a time when the value of the dollar on the internatio nal market was twice that of todav. Viktor's son, Walter Schauberger, al so became involved in \"Project Implosion\". He was supposed to contri bute his knowledge an d scientific co- operation to the common cause of the scheme and to be prepared for a longish sojourn in the USA accomp anied by his family. From the Americans' point of view, this requireme nt seemed justified, for even before the beginning of the 2nd World War, Walter Schauberger had played an important role in a series of his father's fields of research. At the beginning of the War, Walter was severely wounded and having had his leg amputated, was discharged from the field hospital Both were opposed to an extended stay in the USA, however. In principle, they were prepared to assi st for a limited period only. To clear up these and various other questions, the two Americans then returned to the USA. When they reappeared in Austria again, things really began to get moving. Very much now in evidence were the words \"Top Secret\", whose outward expression, inter alia, manifested itself in the constant care of both Schaubergers, which they, however, ne vertheless experienced as a rigorous surveillance. Even clothing coupons we re issued. Entry visas for the USA, for which one could often wait months in those days, were arranged within minutes and with a validity for an imme diate period of four years. Thus father and son received a foretaste of the powerful arm of Uncle Sam whenever the question of dollars was i nvolved. This first taste, however, was not to remain with them for long. 68"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Gerchsheimer arranged for all the vari ous records, calculations, drawings, even technical literature, together w ith all models, designs and pertinent apparata, which had been collected from a variety of places, to be quicklv packed into five giant, watertight containers, which were immediately despatched overseas. These days were distinguished by hectic bustle and activity and cast their shadows over the approaching difficulties in the New World. A few days later, Viktor and Walte r Schauberger were already in New York, where the US Chamber of Commerce had prepared a splendid reception followed by a banquet atte nded by high-ranking military personnel. The Situation Becomes More and More Acute The workshops themselves were located in Texas. It later came to light that the nearest human habitation was about ten kilometres away. All mail was scrutinized by Gerchsheimer persona lly, and the isolation was thus complete. Eric A Boerner, formerly an engineer with the Junkers Company in Germany, but whom in the USA ha d been raised to the position of director of the\"Cosmotron\" accelerato r project in Brookhaven, took pan in one of the first conferences. Gerchsheim er had brought him in as an expert on questions regarding energy. At th is conference Viktor Schauberger unexpectedly renewed his acquaintance w ith one of his former co-workers, a certain Renner from Salzburg. Accord ing to an entry in the documents related to this affair, which are in our possession, \"Rennets transfer to the USA was very close to being a kidnap.\" \"Project Implosion can be started,\" Boerner declared. \"Schauberger's basic considerations and ideas tally w ith recently ascertained facts, which, largely through the mathematical-phys ical endeavours and new inter- pretations of his son, Walter Schauberger , have been significantly extended. . . As energy is problem No. 1 for the USA, its solution requires a total commitment and that both Schaubergers remain in the USA for eight years. . . \" Questions and objections were rigorously curtailed. At a second conference, Viktor Schauberger flatly refused to stay on in the USA even one day longer than the agreed period of three months. \"Otherwise I refuse to talk\" he declared categorically. A third and last conference took place at which Gerc hsheimer announced that it had been decided to authorize Viktor Schauberger 's return journey. At the same time he handed him a contract comprising several pages in English with the request that it be signed immediat ely, although he well knew that Schauberger was unable to read Englis h. \"We must leave for the airport in ten minutes\", urged Gerchsheimer and glanced nervously at his watch. An extremely lively argument ensued which became considerably more heated when Walter Schauberger was informed that he would in no way be permitted to return to Europe with his father. On the contrary, it was desired that he be placed under contract On ce again the tempting phrase: Money is no object. 69"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Wild West Methods Dominate The Americans seemed to have entirely fa iled to grasp that it was precisely their Texan behaviour that so disguste d their Austrian guests. With wild threats and honeyed promises, Gerchsheim er tried to induc e Walter at least to remain. When he finally realised that all his efforts were to no avail, he was quite taken aback. Meanwhile Viktor Schauberger had reached the end of his nervous tether and had signed the cont ract after its essential features had been orally translated for him. At that point he would have signed anything required of him, for he was motivated by one single idea: To get away from the present company and to return to Austria. This contract, of which we have a photocopy, is a typical example of unscrupulous American insatiability. In it Viktor Schauberger not only made over to those clever Yankees all ri ghts to his patents, but also all his ideas, thoughts and discoveries, past as well as future. Moreover, he was not even allowed to talk about them with others. This contract degraded him to an empty shell, for his brain, his inte llect, aye his whole being and all his thoughts had become the \"propert y\" of that US organisation. Apparendy the enforcement of Schaube rger's signature was a typical American show, for afterwards the room was suddenly filled with smiling faces. No one paid any attention to the time and all at once there was any amount of it. They only wa nted to celebrate to the full the \"conclusion of the agreement\". Towards midnight on the 20th Se ptember 1958, both Schaubergers finally arrived back in Linz. Then began the last 100 hours of Viktor Schauberger's life. However, no one had the slightest presentiment of it. His sudden death on the 25 th September 1958 precipitated a riot of rumour that Schauberger had already been in poor health for some time before the tribulations of a long journey for this 74 year old man. No doubt the final blow was his deep disillusionment over the humiliating outcome of his American trip and above all, that fate ful contract with wh ich he had totally delivered himself up to the Ameri cans. \"I don't even own myself any longer,\" he said utterly dejectedly to friends a few hours before he returned to his home. What Did the Americans Really Want? In the meantime, 20 years have elapsed. From the Americans nothing further has been heard, and just as little is know of \"Project Implosion\", which in those days is supposed to have been launched with such great elan. All the various design drawings, plans, calculations and models were left behind in the USA. The question arises; What did the Americans really want to achieve? In the final analysis, was it indeed only the \"Flying Disc\" project in which, long before the trip to Ameri ca, the widest variety of groups on the other side of the Adantic had alre ady shown such surprising interest? Because Schauberger, in the face of demands for the facts, had displayed the greatest restraint, a reticence in no way diminished by offers of millions of dollars, the possibility cannot be rule d out that, by way of Schauberger's main main interest- implosion, it was hoped to reach the real goal (flying discs). 70"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Part II more implosion than explosion "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"More IMPLOSION Than EXPLOSION Compiled by Tom Brown (C) 1986 BSRF, Inc.

First, my wife Alison, who did an excellent review of LIVING WATER . which is probably the best book in English on Viktor Schauberger. Secondly, I wish to thank Borderland Sciences Research Associate Bodo Capeller for his great help in translating a series of articles on Schauberger from the German magazine \"WELTE SPIRAL\", or World Spiral. The readers of this book will be well served by their efforts. This short book is issued in the interests of Borderland Researchers who are truth seeking in the wake of LIVING WATER and BSRF's IMPLOSION - Viktor Schauberger and the Path of Natural Energy. The promise of beneficial technology held out in those two books hits the brick wall of reality on these pages here. For those unfamiliar with Schauberger or Implosion, the review of LIVING WATER will give a glimpse of an incredible man with an incredible vision - to give the world a proper technology in harmony with nature. The horoscope data gives us an insight of Schauberger that we have never been treated to before. The series of articles from the German magazine \"WELTE SPIRAL\" is a most welcome reference for Schauberger's vision. When I first experienced Schauberger's vision, I could see how right the man was. I accepted the information without ever seeing any of the dev ices work. To me the ph oto of Schauberger's home power unit was enough. We were being gyped of our birth- right of natural energy. This was easy enough to believe, as I could find tie-ins with other Borderland Researchers. Through Trevor James Con- stable's book THE COSMIC PULSE OF LIFE I was introduced to the ether physics of Rudolph Steiner. The ethers were under- stood as the four ancient elements - EARTH, WATER, AIR & FIRE, The ether of water is implosive and is no doubt what Schauberger was working with. Trevor shows that the water ether (or chemical ether as it is called) is functionaly equivalent to Wilhelm Reich's ORGONE ENERGY. The many comparisons between Reich and Schauberger cannot be covered in this short introduction, but can be found by anyone with the gumption to pursue knowledge and study it. IMPLOSION and LIVING WATER both carry references to the use of implosion technology for anti-gravity propulsion and we are shown pictures of Schauberger's model saucers. Again I accepted this wholeheartedly. I still agree with the principle, but still would like to see some operational equipment before I pass judgement. The serious research of T. Townsend Brown presents hard evidence that the field around a capacitor in an electric oscillating circuit is electro-gravitic in nature. Eric P. Dollard, Borderland's resident \"Wireless Engineer,\" —a—"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"has shown through his researches with Tesla Technology that the capacitive field (which he terms the dielectric field) is implosive in nature and produces the same illumination effects as Reich's Orgone. So here we see a relationship between the implosive effects of water and the possibilities of anti-gravity; and the implosive effects of the dielectric field and the possibility of anti-gravity© Reich manipulated the Orgone streams around the earth to produce changes in the weather. Nikola Tesla was experimenting with weather engineering via his large Magnifying Transmitter at Colo- rado Spring. This manipulation was effected, not by ELF trans- missions as is popular to believe (with no proof), but by the propagation of the dielectric field, which is the organic side of electricity and has been here shown to be in direct relation- ship with Orgone. Herein reside the keys to a beneficial technology and the solution to the mechanics of anti-gravity. These matters have not really been suppressed — the teeming masses of humanity on this planet are not responsible enough, or spiritualy aware enough to deal with the ramifications of universal energy and true freedom. Concerning this concept, Nikola Tesla had this to say, \"I am unwilling to accord to some small-minded and jealous individuals the satisfaction of having thwarted my efforts. These men are to me nothing more than microbes of a nasty disease. My project was retarded by laws of nature. The world was not prepared for it. It was too far ahead of time. But the same laws will prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success.\" This brings us to the stories of the suppression of Viktor Schauberger's technology. and the demise of his home power unit. These freshly translated articles show that the power unit never worked - in fact it exploded rather than imploded. The author of the German articles, Leobrand, can be non other than Leopold Brandstatter, author of IMPLOSION STATT EXPLOSION. As an astute student should, Leobrand carries on beyond the work of the teacher and shows the problems with Schauberger's view on flow design and such. I now believe more firmly than ever in Schauberger's work. It can be put into the proper perspective — the balance of implosive and explosive forces, working in harmony and balance. This is the true path of natural energy — the Cosmic Pulse of Life. With this new perspective in English it is hoped that the small flame kindled here will help fan the fires of enlightened research and perhaps humanity can move in the direction of preservation of our fragile eco-sphere.

When the forest dies and with it a whol e people perishes, not a finger is lifted. It is k nown that for the death of a people the death of a forest has proceeded it.\" A hundred years ago, a man cal led Viktor Schauberger was born into his role as a guardian of the earth. Among the magnifi- cent Austrian forest he grew up wanting only to become a forest warden \"like my father, grandfather, great-grandfather and his father before him.\" But life was to take him far from the peace and solitude of great mountains. Instead he was to lead the struggle to preserve the earth, the forests and rivers, attack- ing the exploitation of Nature as early as the 1920's. He gave the world a vision of ho w technology could be trans- formed to give free, unpolluting energy. He warned of the conse- quences facing humankind if the present death—oriented technology continues. He died, betrayed by the same powers who promised to make his dreams a reality, commercial ga ngsters who took all and gave nothing back to the world. Olof Alexandersson's biograp hy of Schauberger helps give back to us a hero, someone the author ities prefer forgotten like Reich, Tesla and others who looked to Nature to help solve the world's problems. This is the first book in English to describe Schauberg- er's prophetic work. But back to the story... As a child Viktor was at home in the forest. One of his ancestors from an ancient Bavarian aristocracy moved to Austria and started a branch of the family devoted to the husbandry of the forests and their wildlife. Their motto was \"Fidus in Silvis Silentibus\" - Faithful to the Quiet Forests - their crest showed a tree trunk garlanded with wild roses. From an early age Viktor was an astute observer of nature. He learned directly from nature, closely studying-the relationship between the earth, the t rees and water. But wate r \"the life blood of the earth\" became his consuming pas sion and he set out to dis- cover its laws and characteristics - the secrets of its power. -1-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Far from being an ino rganic substance, Schauberger perceived water to be alive, and with its own cycle of birth and transform- ation into higher forms of energy. He spent hours studying the flow of natural wat erways, how water curren ts become stronger in the early hours of the morning when it is coolest, and particularly during full moon. He remembered the stories of his ancestors who utilized their knowledge of water to tr ansport logs down from the high forested mountains. They built co nstructions down t he mountainsides which forced the water to flow in serpent-like spirals. \"I knew that my father transported hundreds of thousands of cubic metres of beechwood over long distances, never, however, during the day, but at at nights and generally when the moon shone. The reason for doing it this way, as my father often explained, was because water exposed to the sun's rays is tired and lazy and therefore curls up and sleeps. At night, however, and especially in moon light, the water becomes fre sh and lively and is able to support the logs of beech and silver fir which are in fact heavier than water.\" By the end of World War 1, S chauberger was given responsibility for a large wilderness area of almost un touched forest, employed by an Austrian prince. But the prince had problems. He needed money; he needed a way to transport his timber down from the remote forest. Schauberger built water flumes based on hi s own observations and the knowledge of his ancestors. A wat er snake undulating through a dam gave Schauberger the final key to success with his flumes. By imitating its movements, a combinatio n of vertical and horizontal curves, the water chutes carried heavy l ogs effortlessly. Experts came from all over Europe to study the construction, and Schauberger was offered a position with the government. He travelled all over Austria for several years superv ising other constructions which were equally successful — but here Schauberger firs t encountered the professional jealousy and interference that was to mark his life. He had observed how t he streams reacted when the trees were cut down. No longer protected from the sun, the waterways became blocked and the springs that fed them dried up. He began to warn the authorities of the dange rous changes that oc cur when man disrupts the natural harmony of the forests. But the large timber companies that sprang up everywhere, with encouragement from the s tate, had only one goal; to transform trees into money as q uickly as possible. Scha uberger's log flumes had allowed the commerci al exploitation of virgin fores ts which had been inaccessible to t he foresters and he had to witness the brutal damage do ne to natural fo rests destroyed by short-sighted greed. Angry and disillusioned, he resigned from the government and continued exploring the mysteries of water under private employment. 2-"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"IMPLOSION OR EXPLOSION \"There exist two forms of motion within Nature - one that breaks down, the other that builds up and refines; both always work in cooperation with one another. The form of motion which creates, develops, puri- fies and grows is the hyperbolic spiral... the spiralling of nebulae in space, in the move- ment of our planetary system, in the natural flow of water, blood and sap. \"The destructive and dissol- ving form of movement is centri- fugal, in Nature.\" The whole of modern techno- logy is based on the idea of breaking down through heat, combustion, explosion. It exemplifies man's single-minded pursuit of destruction and decomposition. To Schaub erger, the splitting of the atom and the development of nuclear energy is an offence against Nature. \"One can make use of atomic power th rough the biotechnology of implosion.\" He developed his Trout Turbine, named after his observations of trout moving upstrea m. Later renamed the Im plosion Machine, it could generate power without fuel. \"The implosion motor is centripetally operated. It produces its own dr iving source through the diamagnetic use of water and air. It does not require any other fuel such as coal, oil, uranium or ene rgy derived from atom splitt- ing, since it can p roduce its own energy (atomic power) by biological means in unlimited am ounts - almost without cost.\" In this suction turbine an ancie nt principle is rediscovered — it is not pressure but attraction that the \"eternal woman\" of Nature employs. A MEETING WITH HITLER In 1934 Schauberger was requested to present himself to Hitler who was well-informed ab out his earlier work. La ter, during the war he was given the choice either to develop mach ines for the Third Reich, or he would be hanged. He chose the work, understandably, and during this time a project was initiated to build a \"flying saucer\" powered by a 'trout turbine'. One report describes the first test of an unmanned flying disc which climbed to a height of 15,000 metr es in three minutes; it attained a horizontal speed of 2,200 km/h, cou ld hover motionless in the air and could fly as fast backwards as f orwards. This flying disc had a diameter of 50 metres. -4-"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"This may have given rise to the stories later on, that Hitler escaped to South America in a flying saucer, that his death was a fabrication in the Berlin bunker. Whatever the truth, both the Russians and the Americans were highly interested in Schauberger's work. After the war he was confined by the American forces for almost a year because of his knowledge of atomic energy production. He was forbidden to take up again any research into the atomic energy fields. So with meagre resources at hand, Schauberger concentrated on agricultural problems. His work was devoted to increasing the soil's energy, and to encourage the build-up and preservation of the insulation \"skin\" of the earth. He condemned all kinds of artificial fertilizing which exhausts the soil and upsets the subtle balance of nature. \"The farmer of today treats Mother Earth in a worse manner than a whore,\" he wrote. \"Moreover, he prays to a god, whom he believes is up above but in reality is tinder his feet. The modern farmer violates the earth, which reacts by opposing her sungod. \"The old farmer was, for the clod of the earth, both its priest and doctor.\" The modern farmer, like the modern doctor defies Nature and is quite helpless in combating the increasing spread of cancer. There was great interest in Schauberger and his implosion research, especially in Germany, and he was enthusiastic that his message should reach the masses over the world. But he also feared that the centres of power he most distrusted, the energy and armament monopolies, would exploit his discoveries behind his back. With mounting difficulties both financially and physically, he struggled on, driven by a compulsion to help solve the world's growing energy problems. But where to obtain the funds? THE AMERICAN CONNECTION With increasing bitterness, Schauberger realized that his attempts to alert \"the establishment\" to the breakdown of the ecological order were achieving precious little result. And it was then that two Americans appeared and offered unlimited funds if Schauberger would travel to America and impart his knowledge for the good of mankind. He and his son were flown to Texas and taken to the solitude of the desert, far from his beloved forests. There was no communi- cation with the outside world. The post was censored. The so-called unlimited funds was a trick to lure Schauberger into a nightmare experience which ended his life. He was able only to return to Austria if he signed over all his work, past, present and future to the Texan boss 'Mr R.D.' It was made clear to his son Wal ter, that if he did not keep silent in this respect Viktor Schauberger would be silenced by middlemen based in Munich. Five days after he returned home, Viktor Schauberger died, at the age of 73. Despairingly he repeated over and over again: \"They took everything from me, everything. I don't even own myself.\" 5-"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"When he could no longer hide his secrets, Schauberger was forced to do that which he most feared throughout his life, to throw pearls to the swine. But his life's work was not buried with him. The vision he gave to the world continues after his death to inspire and give direction to a world dangerously out of balance. \"The only way left is a return to Nature,\" he said. \"It is clear how man can become the master as well as the servant of all creation. Yet this possibility is held on a knife edge, and one mistake could plunge him into the abyss. The man who understands creative transformation is like a god. The one who manipulates this for his own ends is a servant of the devil, who can destroy the whole world.\" LIVING WATER is more than a biography of a great man. It is a message of survival.

Most inventions developed under small and insignificant circumstances. If a contemporary of Galvani would have only hinted at the outcome of that simple frog leg experiment which now is a major factor in our present day life he would have been declared a dreamer. Similar is the situation in todays implosion research; the pioneers in this field have to experience on themselves how vindictive rejection can be. The universial genius Leonardo da V inci had a good grasp of aironautics proven by his creations of flying machines. However the practical application of flying was doomed due to his insistance to solve the secret of how birds are flying that even has evaded modern technology with all its tools and test instruments. Leonardo da Vinci had selected a dead end path. The solutio n to the manned flight problem w as to go to a later generation. Even those late r pioneers did not come up with a perfect flying machine but h ad to achieve step by step the fundamentals of aeronautics. Intuitive thinking and an engineering background combined with dedicated effort put such people as Otto Lilienthal into the position to lay the basis of modern aironautics. Among many others the Austrian flight pioneer Dr. Igo Etrich build on this foundation. In his memoirs he describes how he was cheated out of the fruit of his labors as soon as he achieved tangible results. Starting with the simple question \"Why is a sailplane able to fly?\" we suddenly are transport ed into celest ial mechanics where we intend to r emain for a little w hile we explore a Pandoras box of natural laws that even beco me more important in the calculation and constr uction of implosion turbines.

Therefore the distance traveled by this planet is four times as long. The traveled orbital distance however is eight times as l ong. It can be reaso ned that a planet at four times distance needs twice as much time for the same distance traveled in relation to the Sun. In this case the orbital radius of Mercury has been used as averaging factor. The orbital speed is therefore half as fast. In picture #4 is shown that with increasing distance from the center point a planet needs more time to travel a mean distance. The function shows a parabolic curve from inception. At four times the distance twice the time is needed, at nine times distance four times time. The picture is somewhat drawn inaccurate.

The increasing speeds have been transfered to the orbit under use of the corresponding radii and joined the resulting vectors. The resulting structure is a spiral.

It c an be said once and for all that besides linear motion the vortex action can be used for power or electric generation, even better than conventional turbines. We find not only advantages in the increased capacity over the late model \"Deriazturbine\", an improved \"Kaplanturbine\", where the efficiency factor is in excess of 95%. Anothe r important advantage is the lack of cavity erosion where for the first time the bladesurface is preserved for a longer time p eriod because the scoops on the runner are no longer pitted. Also it becomes evident that the moving water rather cools than heats which is helpful for the rejuvenation of the water, not to mention the noiseless operation of this turbine. The further development has shown another outstanding development insofar it made p ossible in these new \"Biorotors\" to change centrifugal (axial to radial = from inside to outside) forces into centripetal( radial to axial = from outside to inside) whereby the existence of implosion forces without a doubt can be verified. In this manner one can in one and the same rotor transform overpressure into underpressure which not only is a raise in efficiency but also is the prerequisite of cooling the water. This new development resulted in a patent application of three different models of which the simplest version was build in the spring of 1962 and superseded by improved patent applications later on. In succession two more systems of the original turbine were developed by the inventor. Under this designation they will be pr obably found in the professional literature. After these mainsystems dozens of variations in models can be derived that have been made patent ready. Both systems of \"rotating stream turbines (Drehstroehmungsturbine)\" are suitable for any gradient low, middle, or high. In the case of a low gradient the Kaplanturbine is pr eferred because it is already economical at a gradient of one Meter (33 inches). -13-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The full exploitation technical as well as mathematical of the 1962 rotating stream tur bines could after initial patent issue occupy an engineering team fo r a decade. Not to mention in case of incomplete development is a chance of further improvement for many more decades. The further development of the rotating stream turbine gives it the status of a \"perpetuum mobile\" of secondary kind where the initial impulse pushes it over the 100% efficiency factor. In this case science has to defi ne a different designation. The technical application of the vortex action would in my opinion fully justify the exploitation of this possibility. The thought that under steady application of pressure energies one gives the bioturbine its mom entum which would make it a perpetual motion machine the w ay my predecessor Viktor Schauberger ha d envisioned has to be relinquished by the dyed in the wool \"implosionist\" under the pressure of evidence. For that reason the slogan \"Implosion instead of explosion\" has to give way to \"More imp losion instead of explosion\". This slogan is st ill a distant goal that we have to achieve with more research. We have to bury the old Schauberger slogan \"Implosion instead of explosion\" for the absolute reason that explosion has a reason for existence in the cosmos. The task for technology is to get away from the onesided application of explosive or pressure factors because they cause heat and other un desirable sideeffects. We have to harmonize in the interest of balance in nature the pulling and implosive forces. Technology is also in many areas, for instance in vehicle construction, engaged to switch from high pressure to low pressure ( new cooling systems). It is now hoped for that in 1963 the \"biotechnic\" seeds will germinate. Only at a point where patents have been issued the secret can be lifted. This is the moment where the seeds warmed by the rays of the sun may strongly brea k the soil. Till then we ought to have patience. wl4-"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"THE GERMAN FEDERAL MINISTER FOR NUCLEAR ENERGY ON BIOTURBINES The mechanical engineer Albert Schliephake from Egestdorf-Deister, an intense proponent of biotechnical thought, wrote on April 14, 1962 to the German Ministry for Nuclear Energy on the subject of the new invention of the bioturbine and received the following official reply with those historic important words: Official designation IIBl-5211-o-3/62 Subject: Invention of a bioturbine.

For that reason it was cor rect on your part to suggest to forward the matter of a powerpla nt running on bioturbines to the the minister of economics where the department of electrification would be more receptive to you. As to your critique that the Rhine-Westphalian Electric Company intends to erect a nuclear power plant at the cost of 300 Million Deutsche Mark s may I reply that in view of the great progress in foreign countries with electrical generation from nuclear materials it has become necessary that in the Federal Republic steps have to be undertaken to build a large scale n uclear power plant.

It is also questioned why this matter is no t more accelerated and the construction of nuclear power gene rators effectively delayed . Not at least many of us are asking why Schauberger's idea is not applied in larger measure. The last question has been ans wered sufficiently in the publication \"Welt-Spirale (World Spiral)\" issue 7/8 July 1962. Only recent additions to this will be reported here. The publication \"Implosion statt Explosion (Implosion instead of Explosion)\" that arrived in the summer of 1955 was intended as a solution to the energy dilemma and against nuclear development. It was put down in faith and trust to the integrity of the notes handed to me by Viktor Schauberger. Because of the urgency deemed by the editor and the belief into Viktor Schauberger as a prophet of his insights and discoveries it has not been waited for the photographs of the implosion machi ne or the intended home power plant. The publication went into the world and aroused surprise, hope and s atisfaction among gro ups of progressive and nature loving people. Among the educated group of technicians Viktor Schaubergers views aroused skepticism and icy rejection. A useful explanatio n of this viewpoint was never given. Even Viktor Sch auberger was not pr ivileged to give any practical explanation for the proof of his insight. Finally it got so far that the home power plant could be started up. On the first test run several pipes blew out. There was an explosion instead of implosion because of centrifugal forces getting too strong from a start with a conventional electric motor and the confined water that could not escape through the jets due to faulty construction. Therefore it started under pressure instead of a vacuum. Viktor Schauberger believed after th is that the correction of his mistakes would remedy the situation. The teacher Sebastian Thurner of the Stat e Polytechnic School in Salzburg offered himself to build th e improved vers ion. This machine was never started but the old one went to the United States, was there unsatisfactory disassembled and made totally useless. After Viktor Schauberg ers death in 1958 all development came to a halt. Only in the fall of 1961 did I feel caused by an outside event the urge to begin myself even under heavy personal obligations with research of bio energies. The attempted experiments gave surprising insights and finally practical results. As a result of these research experiences it can be said that the improved second machine which went with Viktor Schauberger to the United States never would have worked -18-"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"because the inventor insisted on grave errors in behalf of current flow within the machine. The Schauberger philosophy of an inverse universe in opposition to an expa nding universe is ju st as onesided as the other. The truth lies in the synthesis that the universe is in a timeless in verse and expanding mo tion. The onesided implosion process is just as valid as an onesided explosion process. Above this the world has known that the explosion process is followed by an implosion process, the only fault lies with technology of not having utilized it in energy generation. Through the simultaneous use of expansion and contraction processes, pressure and vacuum would it be possible to create a perpetual motion of the second degree that does not rely on an initial impulse but takes 100% energy and provides in the work cycle more energy than supplied with. This only can be provided when vacu um forces are a ctively involved. The Viktor Schauberger implosion mot ors were designed to be perpetual motion machi nes started by an initial impulse/ a possibility totally rejected by science as an absurdity. It is just not enough to give a power generator an initial impulse to make it go forever. A perpetual motion machine of the second degree is more plausible to sci ence. On many sides is the effort under way not only in the field of cold combustion - note the work of professor Justi yet to be reported - to solve the problem. These experiments are costly. Even scientific institutions do not have sufficient funds available, not to mention the lone inventor. Only large corporations with their workshops, test stands and laboratories are in the position to conduct those experiments and measuring to the proper degree. Regardless a lot has been accompl ished in a single year. Without boasting one can say that inventions made last year have given surprising successes in the field of bio turbines that need patent protection. The attempt to build rotary or vortex tu rbines goes back many decades. Most came to naught because the proper spin could not be established. Against my initial patent application with the Austrian patent office it was countered with four vortex based turbines with i dentical basis already patented. In this case we were dealing with an old Austrian patent granted in 1923 and even older patents from Switzerland, Great Britain and the United States. On closer study and comparison wit h my invention one may observe that all those other inventions, failed in generating a centripetal regular vortex. Some of these inventions show gross mistakes in flow design such as stop pages and irregular vortexes that makes one wonder how the patent protection ever could be extended. These inv entions never saw practical application because of a low efficiency factor that even cannot compete with conventional Pelton, Francis and Kaplan turbines.

Latest research shows two flowsystems in use that cannot be accounted for in a single pa tent. Each of thes e systems can be manufactured in many variations with t he possibility of a dozen different models. In all cases can be said that existing conventional turbine systems that span a development period of over a hundred years are facing two newly disc overed systems barely one year old.

By clinging to the mistakes Viktor Schauberger made a l ot of time has been lost. As soon as these mistakes we re recognized things moved rather rapidly. Also it has to be mentioned that development with the most meagre means is still very expensive . Without the help of generous frie nds it never would have been possible to solve all problems. Theoretical speculatio n would never get to the heart of the matter. Rather empirical experiments were necessary and still are needed. Those self sacrificing friends that consist of closest mental allies should be thanked in public at this occasion. Not only experiments cost money but also patents before they are granted.

The vortex is a basic law of the uni verse. We shall see that the vortex is present from the interstellar nebulae to the atom its elf. The energy of the vortex molds the Universe from the microcosm to the m a cr oc os m. It is the formative energy of creation. Every organ in every living thing is a part of a frozen vortex. All organs are literally vortex formed. Dr. Theodore Schwenk of Weleda Laboratories has published an excellent book entitled the Sensitive Chaos in which he gives example after example of the vortexial formative pro cess in nature. The primordial force involved in vortex formation is tuned to the woof and warp of the Universal matrix. All f l ow in g fl uids, although appearing to be uniform in structure are divided into extensive inner surfaces. When any discontinuity appears in the fluid, such as an obstruction, the inner surfaces flow at different rates and form themselves into a spiral or vortex. When a vortex is formed it appears to have a body of its own. It separates from the rest of the fluid and behaves as if it were a solid mass. It is self contained yet bound up with the whole. We find that the vortex has a rhythm of its own. It shrinks in diameter and increases in le ngth at one moment, at the next it expands in diameter and shrinks in length. It continues this oscillation in a periodic manner just like a pendulum or the mainspring of a watch. We can ea sily view the pa rts of a vortex by adding a little glycerin to water. We then put the water in a clear cylinder with a hole in the bottom. The water is stirred so that a vortex funnel is formed. We then add a few drops of food coloring to the water. 21 JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1989 JBR, Page 1"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The entire vortex comes alive. We can see the layers of formative surfaces as well as the rhythmic pulsation of the whole. The inner surfaces spin more rapidly than the external ones and form cork screw like patterns that remind us of fancy sea shells. If we look at the vortex from above we see a hole which is the suction c enter. We drop a small piece of wood into the water and find that the wood circles around the vortex hole, first moving slowly and then more rapidly as it approaches the center. It then cir- cles around the vortex throat in an eccentric manner and is projected to the outside layers again. The wood is actually describing an ellipse in which the focus of the ellipse is the center of the vortex throat. On examination we discover that the water circulating around the vortex follows the exact laws of planetary motion. In fact the planets of our solar system follow the exact same circulation in their orbits around the sun. The sun is the focus of the elliptical planetary orbits. This law of planetary motion was discovered by Johannes Kepler hundreds of years ago! The vortex in its laws of movement is a miniature copy of the solar system. On a larger scale it is a found in the great stellar nublae. Our small piece of wood eventually gets caught in the center of the vortex and is drawn to the b ottom of the cylinder. According the Dr. Schwenk the vortex has other properties that suggest that it may have cosmic connections: If a small floating object with a fixed pointer is lowered into a vortex, it will circle around and around with the po inter always pointing in the direction in which it was ori ginally aimed. It acts just like a compass needle! It will always be directed toward some point in infinite space. According to Schwenk this s h o w s that a vortex is always oriented as if it were held in place by invisible cosmic threads. Page 2, JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1989 JBR 22"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The vortex is a miniature model of the entire universe. Its orientation in space corresponds to the fixed stars, its layered circ ulation corresponds to planetary motion and the suction center corresponds to the sun. The velocity of fluid at any point in a vortex is equal to a ph ysical constant divided by the radius from the suction center. That is to say that velocity increases as the radius gets smaller. In a perfect vortex, as the radius approaches zero its fluid velocity will approach infinity. As infinite velocity is im possible in the physical universe, something has to give. In the case of water the molecules begin to dissociate into a vapor. This dissociation is accompanied by the generation of high voltage electricity. We have measured charges as high as 12,000 volts in the exact center of a liquid vortex! The pr essure in the center of a vortex is theoretically infinitely negative. In this condition, space would be turned inside out. The exact shape of a vortex is a hyperboloid or hyperbola of rotation. From elementary geometry we may recall the formula of a hyperbola. We find that the curve of a vortex is a special hyperbola which is known as a square hyperbola. In the liquid vortex if the Vertex is 1, the Focus is equal the the square root of 2. In the diagram, a square hyperbola is represented. The s haded portion represents the cross sectional form of a liquid vortex. The mirror image above the shaded portion is the imaginary hyperbolic fo rce field above the physical vortex below. The V in the diagram is the peak of the curve, and is called the vertex. As with other conic sections such as the parabola and the ellipse the hyperbola also has focal points which are represented by F. 2.3 JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1989 JBR, Page 3"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Viktor Schauberger, the G e rm an Forestmeister observed the liquid vortex in nature. He spent a lifetime observing the flow of mountain streams in the virgin f orests of Bavaria and Austria. The world is in great debt to this pioneer. He observed many phenomena associated with the liquid vortex. These phenomena include: energy discharges such as halos, and ball type lightning; levitation - in which heavy egg shaped stones float on the top of a vortex; the production of virgin water or edel wasser (living water); the purification of polluted water; and the production of free energy. Schauberger and his son Walter who is also a p i o n e e r in this area of investigation developed, egg shaped vortex reaction chambers. These chambers are called implosion c hambers as the energy developed is centripetal rather than centrifugal. He ma intained that centripetal energy is the basis of life whereas centrifugal energy is the basis of decay and destruction. In the same way that a hyperbola is a conic section, Schauberger reasoned that the perfect shape for a vortex chamber was an egg shape which is a cross section cut through the hyperboloid form of rotation developed from the square hyperbola. In other words, a cross sectional cut through the vortex throat. The evolution of the Schauberger egg is shown in the next diagram. The vortex spiral when viewed from above is a harmonic spiral first discovered by Kepler. This spiral is shown in the diagram. As it approaches the center from the outside, it decreases in size with each turn from unity on the outside to 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, etc. Page 4, JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1989 JBR Z4"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"In our research, we have been looking at another possibility for the perfect vortex re action chamber. If we look at the formulas for the hyperbola and the ellipse we find that they are exactly the same except for the sign in between the x and y portions. In the case of the hyperbola, the figure is open and the ends of the lines never touch each other. In the case of the ellipse we have a closed curve which when rotated about the axis will yield a ellipsoidal container. We reasoned that the best container for a vortex would be the mathematical compliment or inverse to the hyperbola. A type of ellipsoid. The question became one of discovering the exact mathematical inverse to the the hyperbola. However, as the water vortex curve is a square hyperbola, the first th ought is that the inverse is a circle which is the cross section of a sphere. T his shape turned out to be a very poor container for a vortex, as a m a t t e r of fact it was the w orst container for g enerating a perfect vortex. We went back to the drawing board and finally derived the exact inverse form. This form is an ellipse that has points that are exactly ta ngent to the significant points on the hyperbola. As we can see in the next diagram, we have an ellipse shape which is superim posed on the square hyperbola. The outline of the ellipse is s haded so that it can be easily seen. This ellipse is indeed the exact compliment to the square hyperbola. The vertex of the hyperbola is the focus of the ellipse, and the focus of the hyperbola is the vertex of the ellipse. The vertexes of the diagonal hyperbolas are just touching the na rrow sides of the ellipse. The l ength to width r atio of this ellipse is one to the square root of two. We can call t his ellipse a root two ellipse. 25 JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1989 JBR, Page 5"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"An easy test to see which container is indeed the perfect c ontainer for a vortex is to construct various containers of equal volume and then drill small holes in the bottoms.

The hole is then unplugged and the formation of a vortex is observed. It will be f ound t hat different sha ped containers require different sized holes to sustain a vortex flow discharge by gravity alone. When the hole is too small the water loses momentum and simply flows from the container in a solid stream which is devoid of vortex flow. When the hole is enlarged a point will be found at which the increased rate of flow will provide enough gravitational energy to sustain a vortex. The c l o ser the container is to the perfect curve for s ustaining a vortex, the smaller the required hole and therefore the smaller the required energy for sustaining a vortex. The perfect container w ill be one that develops a resonance with the hyperbolic vortex discharge. At resonance the vortex shaped flow will be sustained with minimal flow rate and therefore minimal energy.

(l)Austrian Patent N°113487 \"Construct for Creating Wild Brooks and Flow-regu- lation\" (Einbau zur Wildbachverbauung und Flussregulierung); June 10, 1929. The invention corresponds to a construct for creating wild brooks and flow-re- gulation through the speed of water that is danned, so that with orientated sto- nes no destruction may cone along the course of the waterpath through the danc- ing constructs, and to place the central line of the watercourse in the middle of the stream. In the drawings (see next page) is the invention illustrated, at Figure 1 is an exanple of water-conduction (Ausfuhrung) and damming in the shape of transver- sally-placed dans. The dans (l) are hollow and made of concrete placed arid anchored at the ground through suitable anchorings (2), so that theymay not be displaced by the stre- aning water. They are placed as striations against the direction of the water- flow, upon which the water runs and along which it will sluice; through this co- ursing the water loses the greatest portion of its energy and does not strike too hard against the placed dans forcing them out of place. The dams can be placed at far or snail dist ances from each other in the course of the constructed brook. In order to lay the theoretical middle of the stream in the midst of the flow in far-off places and also to prevent the destruction through erosion of the river shore, we will place constructs by the sides of the flow that act as dans as seen at Figure 2 (see next page). In this figure are indicated by (3) the dans, while stones are placed at (4) in opposite places. Trough them runs the middle line of the waterflow (5) as illustrated. Figure 3 (next page) shows in greater detail one of such constructs and Figure 4 a transversal cut through one of them. The constructs (3) are essentially t riangular-shaped, and are jammed into the soil against the shore so as to elevate and make flow the water towards a midd- le point.

(2)Austrian Patent N°122144 \"Artificial Channel for Transporting Logs\" (Kuns- tliches Gerinne zum Schwemmen von Holz u. dgl,); April 10, 1931. The transportation of logs and other varied loads through water channels and other artificial channels, though its low cost makes it competitive against oth- er transportation means, suffers under the condition that when moving along the water flow some logs, specially in the curves, tend to renain stuck; in this way stop the following logs, diminishing the general speed of the transport; this is specially true for hard and dense woods that remain at the bottom of the channel and move forwards very bad. It is known that the speed displayed by logs in water channels is greater than that of waterspeed; at those places the speed of the logs greatly surpasses that of the transporting medium and it is seen from itself that the swimming log creates before it a waterwave (see Figure 1, next page), we have a log (H) which generates a frontal wave (0) as it moves. While lighter wood (see Figure 2, next page) swims without problems, heavier wood sits itself at the bottom of the channel (see Figure 3, next page) and re- aains stuck; therefore the water in pulse in channels is not enough until now to produce the usual notion through sliding without outwards water spillage. The invention pertains to a discovery that corrects these evils, namely the e- limination of water spillage through the implating of wedges made of wood and the transportation of hard and dense woods through sliding in the channels. The speed of water depends over all also on its sliding over the channel walls; in the usual slanted channels, this important factor is eliminated because of their construction. The channels' cross-section is not semicircular or straight, but rather, as se- en in Figures 2, 3 and 4 (see next page), semicircular (B) with an added sehic- ircular botton (U) which radius is half that of the upper portion (B), so that along the line (E)-(F), see Figures 2-3 (next page), a resting portion (L) can be included; the internal wall at the upper semicircular portion is of striated Material (unretouched cement, directionally-nailed woods, etc), and the underl- ying portion (U) of a sliding material (flattened cement, polished wood, etc) so that the waterspeed in the under region (U) is much greater than at the upp- er part (B). This causes at once the sinking of water in the middle of the stream (see Figur- e 4, next page) when in practice a weight falls a certain distance that the wa- ter striking against the striated channel walls moves further,maintaining the mass (H), see Figure 4 (next page), in the midst of the flowing medium by means of the polished underzone (U) that displaces the fluid faster. When transporting floating light woods (Figure 2, next page), this will not ca- use any disorder in the flow of water, for the underzone (U) will run faster than the upperzone (B), in this fashion it will not be necessary to build dams outside the channel to contain the spilled water. From light woods we must expect little problem, with hard and dense wood we must expect it to sink deeper and to advance with difficulty, so that this kind of wood will sink itself into the faster-running underside (U), and advance in"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"( 4 ) this fashion as if advanced by a transporting band. When transporting hard and dense woods (see Figure 3, above) come into play di- fferent lavs; the wholly submerged log (H) un loads its whole volume into the faster-running water, so that the pressure upon (E) and (F) of the submerged sliding skids (L) makes them enter in action; for this time the usual in pulse of water is not enough to make advance the log (H), that if these means are not added must remain stuck into the bottom of the channel. The sliding offered by skids (L) lightens the log (H) deposited upon the faster running flow (u) and makes this use its impulse to propel the heavier log for- wards. In opposition to the present (1931) transportation of hard woods through chan- nels built with hardened materials, the hard and dense woods will be transport- ed by doubly-concave channels which walls are built with lighter naterials for they are not obliged to withstand such heavy loads; in curves, where the moving wood is obliged to follow them we can through the proper construction (see Figu- re 5, above) of the channel, with only a one-sided channel wall, make the log"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"(5) move towards the outside vhere it will be held by the running water along the curve; if needed be we can add sliding skids as seen (L) which can be improved by the addition of wheels. (3)Austrian Patent N°134543 \"Conduction of Water in Tubes and Channels\" (Wasser- fuhrung in Rohren und Gerinnen); August 25, 1933. This invention relates to the concentration of flowing water within polished conduits (pipes), channels and tubes, so as to increase the amount of flowing medium passing through them. The inventor has discovered that when a certain kind of turbulence happens in flowing water, then a temperature difference takes place within it; producing also a difference in the water speed, and that this happens specially in Waltz- like flows. It is known that to hinder sedimentation, water channels and tubes are built of circular cross-section, so that the flowing medium may drag with itself any se- diments left; this is to provoke a \"screw-like\" movement of water so that it may attract all particles in its path. This invention per tains to a further develophent of this principle, to drag sedimentated masses with moving water. The main idea of this invention is seen in Figure 2 (next page) where the usual path of flowing water (4) is detoured by a wedge-shaped device into a different way (5). Figure 5 (next page) shows an improvement of this idea by adding striations (6) to the wedge placed on the inner wall of a channel or tube. In Figure 1 (next page), we see the wedges grouped (2)-(2')-(2\" ) in groupings of three, and producing as a result the screw-like flow (3)-(3')-(3\"), through the internal portion of the conduit (l). This makes the waterflow concentrate at the center of the tube, with a concen- trical motion, dragging along any particles left upon the walls. Figure 3 (next page) also shows, in a lateral view, how the normal water path (4) is changed to a concentrical one (5), to generate a concentrical flow in the flowing medium. Figure 4 shows how open semicircular channels can also be adapted to the same purpose.

This invention pertains to an installation related to the conduction and regul- ation of flow in water channels by contention and stabilization in higher level by means of darts integrated into them that depend on the outer tertperature of flowing water and the mixing at will of light and hard water conducted out of the basin by its own means, with which it is convenient to direct the outer-flo- wing hard water for cooling the layers of lateral walls of the dart of the ba- sin, as will be shown herein. It is known that for the management of water channels in all channel-building techniques that a weighty argument such as water te perature in Earth vessels arid air temperature as the temperature difference between still and running wa- ter, is always left out; and it is also known that the temperature differences between two (or more) watercourses modifies their speed when they mix."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"(6) So far, only through artificial constructs in dams, the naturally-built water channels running underground or only through ra mparts (where only hard water with a temperature close to +4 °C comes out) or by means of aqueducts placed a- top dams (through which cha nnels only lightwater of high temperature flows), finding obstacles in their coursing thro ugh the channel and causing erosion in their shores.

The widening of the channel through the em placement of stones or elimination of sane (ballast-banks) and elevation of the shore, specially in curves, can be made by the corresponding directing but usually provokes a count erflow that er- odes the whole work. Through several devices that will be explained here, it is possible the steering of both light and hard waters, corresponding to the temp- eratures of each and also to the related fall of temperature, so that by means herein explained each water will run along its own level. At the same tine with the regulation of the waterflow it can also be effected the necessary installation, in the closing dam of the basin-corresponding cons- truction, of those pipes that will effect the cooling of the dan's pores thro- ugh the sides of the dam bymeans of small watercourses directed through the materials Then as temperature diminishes, the wa ter within the dam's pores loses its attraction for dissolving salt and other stuffs, until it reaches its balance point at +4°C, at which its capacity for di ssolving is the least and the fil- tration in the dart's wall is the strongest. So far, it is then when the light water infiltrated in the wall for cooling will go inside the materials through the pores, in this moment the channel wa lls close to the dart are filled with hard water at a temperature of +4°C, whic h lose their salts into the neighbour- ing ground as they move, creating in a few weeks of impregnation a further ba- rrier against erosion. When the stuff ge ts into the pores of the dam's walls, then the shine of the Sun rays will warm the waters, further crystallising the deposited salts and increasing the resistance to erosion, and if the frost comes then it will also contribute to the strengthening of the walls. (Please, go to the illustrations of next page from now on) In the drawings we find a further explanation of a device for this kind of installation, it is se- en in transversal cut in Figure 1 and in upper view at Figure 2; while at Figu- re 3 we appreciate an internal view in cu taway fashion of the apparatus for ste- ering water. To the sake of regulating the flow of cold hard water and warm light water are placed groundnozzles (0) in the damchamb er (r) of basin (B) on both sides of the dam, which doors (T) are activated through a floating device (G) that moves because of temperature differences. The pipes (W) of the nozzle (O) lead up to the upper-placed portion (K1) where flow c onduits (U1)-(U2)-(U3), which are clo- sed through gravity-activated valves (V 1)-(V2), branch in different heights from the upper-going pipe (W), and that lead further into the lateral wall of the basin, spreading out there into the co rresponding casts. At the feet of the dam's internal wall will be conveniently placed, the outstanding portion (K2) to produce a whirling and better mixing of the watermasses flowing over the wall. The door (T) in the nozzle (O), cleaves the soil of the waterchannel sinking it- self into it and it is connected vertica lly bymeans of a shaft (F), coursing inside the daM's wall (H), with the floating device (G) that is built as a sub- mersible bell. In the illustrated wall (H), we find at different heights over the ground-nozzle (0) tube-shaped outlets (A) that are communicated with the tube leading upwards to bell (G) and th at allow the automatic emptying of the water basin. When the pipe (W) is allowed to fill through the openi ng of door (T ) it will allow a communication between the pipe and the basin, that will release pressu- re from door (T) unilaterally and in th is fashion allow its free motion upwards.

Through both an open end- ing and with the oustanding tube ( R ) , we can through the floating up or down of the bell create a flowing of water. When the diving bell is fully sunk, without any airmargin, it acts as a total closer of the valve; and when we inject ai r within it, then raises to allow the opening of door (T). In nornal work, the atmosphe re imprisoned within the be ll (G) is equal to the usual atmospheric pressure and thus the outer temperature of the environment acts as a control; depending on the impris oned airvolume within (G), the outer temperature will make it raise or desce nd, allowing the steering of door (T)"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"(9) upwards, so that the \"mass of hard water that will be conducted through the nozz- le (O), the pipe (W) and the flow tubes (U1)-(U2)-(U3), will depend on the chan- ges of outer tenperature; the light water flows over its own flowing plate (M) placed atop the dan's crown in the basin. The interpenetration (Durchmisschung) of light and hard waters can be in proved through the construct (K2) placed at the f oot of the dam's inne r wall, and also because of the fact that hard water fa lls vertically while light water does so spirally through flowtubes (U 1)-(U2)-(U3) , so that dur ing their fall they will combine. Through heating fron the Sun's rays the diving bell (G) will further rise the door (T) and through the channel a la rger percentage of hard water will be eli- minated with respect to the light water that flies over the dam's top, and ins- tead with cooler external temperatures the door (T) will remain either totally or almost totally closed and the channe l will only conduct warm overflowing li- quid.

I have placed the flowtube (U2) in the lower part of the dam's wall (K ), so that it will further lead hard water, to move upwards the bell (G) and thus open the do- or (T) to prevent th e waters fron overflowing the basin's level. The water flowing within th e d a w ' s lateral walls contributes to further cooling them and also to leave deposited salts and other stuffs that it loses when rea- ching a temperature of +4°C. By opening the flowtube (U3) atop the dart's wall, the upper portion of the dam can be affected as indicated in the form er paragraph; the welfare of the dart's walls (in all its portions) needs this pr ocess of impregnation so that its po- res are closed and no filtrations may happen. The upper plate (M) serves to both allow the overflowing of lightwater and to separate the hardwater flowing through condu it ( U 3 ) , thus helping to further its endurance.

This invention pertains to an improvem ent of said idea by conveniently placing in the water's path a device to pr oduce whirling motions in the fluid.

In the forementioned procedures it is necessary, for making the water, be not simply in free form but in combination and that in each relation a good mineral water be produced, so that the final product be as similar as possible to natu- ral springwater. (Please from now on, refer to the illustration in next page) Sterilised water flows through mercury light of cold kind in tube (m) and mixes itself with the diluted salts coming from (1). In container (C) are diluted the mentioned salts in water and through revolving fan (g) well mixed. The mixture and kinds of sa- lts direct themselves naturally through the sterile water outlet and so do with different and permanent degrees of hardness. On the other side, so that the concentration is not too high, the artificially generated mineral water's hardness must not exceed factor 12 so that industry may not be hindered by it; anyway outgoing water does need for every 10 liters outputted 1 liter of diluted salts in the following constituentes and proport- ions: Sodium Chloride (NaCl) 0,02 g Magnesiun Sulphate (flgS04) 0,02 g Sodium Biphosphate (NaPh2) 0,02 g Potasium Nitrate (KN03) 0,008 g Calcium Oxide (CaO) 0,2 g The kind and proportion of these salts are the results of several hundreds of experiments. While the Calcium oxyde dissolves itself in water, on the other side the Calcium Hydrate is very sensible to the Oxygen in the carbonic acid, and thus is affected by the oxygen of the acid and the light being showered from upon. To the sake of regulating the liquid flowing out of container (C), this is ins- ide at a constant pressure of 0,1 atmosphere = 1 meter of acid water; the conc- entrated diluted salts will fall dropping along the pipe (1) and when mixed with the contents from (A) will flow into the apparatus (D) which turns them in- to droplets, where they will jump fron the outflow holes of pipe (n) towards the walls of the apparatus (D); during the process the water already processed through carbonic acid will flow outside through the tube (k). The droplets of both mixed liquids falls downwards and mixes itself in the way, as it happens in nature where the droplets of rain first lose their salts and diluted gasses when hitting the ground; this mixed water flows within and thro- ugh the Tulip-glass device (E), where it always goes up in the outer tulip gla- sses and down in the inner ones, so that it will pass into the other following tulip glass vessel after it has climbed into the innermost one of the former stage and thus continues its flow.

The gas, specially carbonic acid, collects it self in the upper portion of the tulips and will then, through the corresponding growing pressure, flow through pneumatic tube (r), in which finest nozzles is also injected water for flowing, so that each carbonic acid that is not already combined will later be with the water.

In its further motion, water penetrates into the main mixer (F ) which is an in- sulated-against-heat standing cylindrical device, that is silvered within and in of which is located an upward-spi ralling path which dire ction of winding go- es against that of the snail and is made out of wire mesh. On the spiral's surface are orderly placed cooling spirals, that take the temp- erature of water from 17°C to 4°C. The goa l of this temperature fall is to pro- perly combine the chemical elements; through the coo ling will be increased the absorption of gases in water, on the ot her side it makes possible the combinat- ion and enrichment of free carbonic aci d of the resulting ma sses without the u- sage of pressure. The Ca(HCO 3 ) 2 presents a weak exteri or combination that the enrichnent with the forementioned carbonic acid in water had wo rked out, but it is only possible the enrichment of Ca(HCO 3 ) 2 with carbonic acid throu gh cooling in water and the maintenance of an even temperature. The temperature of outflowing water must not be over 20°C and its final temper- ature (once it was processed) should not be over 4°C; also must be taken into consideration that the speed of flow must not be too fast so as to allow the proper mixing of liquids; after abandoning the container ( F ) , the liquid is ma- de to flow through gold an d silver foils until reaching vessel (I), which is divided into chambers (G) and (H). First the water that overflows fro m (G) falls into chamber (H), and so on out of the device (z). By the treatment of water as indicated , many reactions are produced, first of all the water is made wholly drinkable; also it is necessary to eliminate any possible exposition to light during the process for the falling of light over the treated liquids produces a lo ss of quality in the final results. (7)Austrian Patent N°166644 \"Plow\" (Bode nbearbeitungsgerat), August 25, 1950 It resulted from numerous experiments th at a better ploughing of the soil can be made, instead of using plows made of Iron or St eel, with Copper-covered plo- ws; this difference becomes stronger wh en one notices that speed of ploughing becomes faster and that the friction betw een the ground a nd the corresponding portion of the plow is greater. This effect because of overspeed produces the slow desintegra tion of the Copper cover and the minute Copper portions depo sited in the soil produce a catalytic effect, that in turn generates a bett er water-retention in the ground and also a further increase in quality of ploughing. These findings were made when passing a plow which body was either covered or entirely made with Copper. But as the building in whole of the plow with Copper is disadvantadgeous, then it will be convenient to co ver those portions made with hard metal with Copper layers in hardened condition, which can be made through several different meth- odologies; the deposit of Copper particles under the ground does not break the magnetic permeability of the soil, as does Iron or Steel.

Appendix: Updating Schauberger's Ideas Now that the old patents ha ve given us more backgrou nd information to profit from the ideas tran slated by BSRF Associate Albe rt Zock, whose articles and translations comprise most of the sec tion on Viktor Schauberger in Peter Linde- mann's book, I think it is proper to update these data with more modern ones. To do this, in the coming pages you will find illustrati ons and photos taken from: Figures I to XVI and XX, Gottfried Hilscher's \"Energie im Uberfluss\" (Energy in Excess), Adolf Sponholz Verlag, Hameln, Germany, 1981. Figures XVII to XIX, Peter Lindemann's work. The text about Schauberger in Hilscher's book is much less explanatory than the one translated by Associate Zock, so I will only translate the text under the illustrations and photos, identifying each: Figure I: The letters PKS, placed upon Walter Schauberger's home, are for \"Pyth- agoras-Kepler School\", Biotechnical Academy; Pythagoras because he knew on the \"Harmony from the Spheres\" and Johannes Kepler because he studied cosmic orbits; they are the greatest of Schauberger's Spirit- ual forefathers for whom in their names is already demonstrated the School's reverence (see next page). Figures II-III: Exhibit in the schoolroom of the PKS school; both photographs illustrate the differences between Euclidean (\"Euklidisches\") and Non-Euclidean (\"Nichteuklidisches\") forms through the exam- ples of biasedly cut hollow bodies; if one cuts in slant a cir- cular cylinder one gets the usual ellipse (upper photo), howe- ver a slanted cut of the \"Tonal Tower\" (see for more data, Fi- gure V, page N°18), which is built according to the \"Law of Na- tural Tones\", yields as result the natural Egg-form (see bottom photo); it shows (as seen at left of Figure III), a circularly hyperbollic motion which inward sense of movement, indicating that a centripetal motion is possible, is shown in the waterwh- irl (see next page).

The arrows indicate that the natural motion is centripetal inward-going (\"einrollende\") one, by means of which Energy in a system is conserved (see next page). Figure VII: The waterwhirl reveals the structural constitution of the liquid e- lement, for Walter Schauberger and his school the whirl is one of the uncounted illustrations of cosmic evolutionary pathways that follow the hyperbolic spiral in Nature: In far away galaxies, in the double helix of the DNA, and - naturally - in the snail; if man were to attach himself to the natural spiral-geometry he would soon find Euclidean geometry as useless; Nature is an open \"Non-Euclidean\" builder, Walter Schauberger follows Pythagoras who understood the Universe as a harmonical event that was encompassed by the \"Harmony from the Spheres\". The \"Law of Natural Tones\" of the visible and audible, discovered in the old \"Monochord\" string instrument, gives Schauberger the fo- undation for the Non-Euclidean technology in his hands, which uses centripetal motions (instead of centrifugal circular movements) which are proper of water and air whirls (see next page).

Figure XIII: Setup of the Watery Filaments Experience; two \"Water Filaments\" ( \"Wasserfaden\") stream out of two nozzles passing through two meta- llic spirals (\"Reizzone\") towards two insulated containers; within each vessel is a Copper plate (\"Kupferplatte\") connected with a spiral (\"Spirale\") bymeans of an insulated Copper wire (\"Kupfer- draht mit Isolierung\") in crosswise fashion; two spirals are held in place under the water filanent bymeans of nylon filanents (\"Ny- lonfaden\" ), both spirals are metallic and not covered by any ins- ulation (see page N°24). Figure XIV: Here are illustrated the pathways taken by the droplets generated when the watery filanent struck the metallic spiral; Alexandersson described the energy thus generated as a pulsating bluish light that began at the opening of the nozzles and extended itself all o- ver the excitation zone (\"Reizzone\" in Figure XIII)(se e page N°24).

This submarine idea was taken from the observation of fish, espe- cially of trout, which can st and motionless in a flowing stream, just by taking water in and out This process has two functions, first it creates a vacuum in front of the mouth into which the fish gets sucked, and at the same time provides food, as the water contains all th at the fish needs. While the food goes into the digestive system, the water is forced through the fan-like structure of the gills, which not only absorb the oxygen needed, but also push the water backwards. This specially compressed water does not mingle right away with the rest, it glides along the conical body like a wedge and shoves it forward. In addition, on the scales it forms little whirls which enhance the push further. However, Viktor Schauberge r was not the sole observer of this phenomenon. Before him others not only formed the same idea but even constructed prototypes with some results. One inventor, A. Borner, came to the conclusion that the speedy motion of a fish is relative to the size of its gills. He constructed a boat with a precise opening in its bow, where a turbine sucked in water like a fish, and pushed it out through slit-like exit ports in such a way that it glided along the hull like a sheet, not only separating it from the friction of the outside water, but also giving it an additional push forward. Further, he applied such skin depressions like sharks have on his ship's hull, presuming that they cause small swirls, and so increased the forward motion. Bo rner even incorporated the slippery skin layer that fishes have by applying oil to the hull to reduce friction. He hoped all this would bring a 60-80% re- duction in fuel Indeed, experiments with his boat FORELLE, meaning trout', achieved twice the speed, while still using the same amount of fueL Apparentiy,Bornerdidnotknowthespiral-vortex, which is an invention of Viktor Schauberger. If properly applied, it will not only increase speed, but also reduce fuel consump- tion to a minimum! This drawing by Dipl. Ing. Water Schauberger, Viktor's son, shows such a submarine. His bio-technical submarine has a movable bow, which gives the boat the flexibility fish have. The conical and rifled water-intake permits a variable step-up, creating a strong torque on the water, which, after entering the implosion turbine, will be intensified to such a pitch, that now its recoil (reson ance) is driving it instead of the motor, as bio-technical appl ications always have a pull and push action. Such a turb ine consist of tapered-down pipes with inside rifling which are bent into spirals. Such FREE ENERGY is not a question of time, rather the will to use it, as it already exists, givi ng us a chance to move on water, under it and in the air using on ly a fraction of the energy we use today!
