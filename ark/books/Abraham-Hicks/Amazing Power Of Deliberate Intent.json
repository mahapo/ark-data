Hay : When the Students Are Ready, the Teacher Appears! In this mistery called Life we‘re continually surching for answer. We‘ve always wanted to take control of our lives, but we haven‘t known how. We‘ve always wanted to alleviate our fears from the smallest most intimate fears we have about our bodies and close relationships, to the larger fears we have about death, our government and the world. And even those fears we may have about life on the other planets. This most comforting book takes care of all of that. No matter what our fear or concern may be, Abraham not only has an answer for us, but also an easy process that we can do that will take us beyond the fear or the problem to a new level of enjoying life. I believe that the teachers known as Abraham are some of the best on the planet today. Their words have certainly expanded my own outlook on life. And I‘m most greatful to Jerry and Esther Hicks for their time and devotion to bringing these teachings to us at this point in time and space. There is a time and the season to expand our knowledge, and this time is now. And you are being blessed and prospered by having this book coming to your hands. I‘ve been aware of Abraham and of Jerry and Esther Hicks for several years. The moment I heard Abraham‘s words, I felt a deep connection. This is a teacher who is doing very good work, I thought. And the more I was exposed to the teachings, the more praise I had for the teacher. In time I came to know Jerry and Esther. I was most impressed by how well they lived the teachings. Here were two joyous people manifesting good experiences at every turn. They loved each other and loved life more than most people I know. I enjoyed seeing how they always seemed to communicate with each other with joy and laughter. It does my heart so much good to see people really enjoying life all the time. We at Hayhouse are very proud to be the publisher of this series of this books. And to have the opportunity to now take this work to a larger worldwide audience. Ask and it is given, the first book in this series, was called by best selling author Wayne Dyer, a publishing milestone that offers you a blueprint for understanding and implementing your own destiny. This book, the second in this series, takes you further into your Self. It builds self-confidence as you will find that you now have a numerable tools to help you take care of any situation that may come along. As this self- confidence builds, you‘ll learn that you can accomplish anything. You‘ll learn to release struggle and instead begin practising the art of allowing. You‘ll also be delighted to find out how easy it is to live life as joyously as you have always wanted it to be. I suggest you do as I do, and keep both books by your bedside for morning and evening reading. You‘ll sleep better, you‘ll beging your days by allowing only good to enter your life, and you‘ll feel good as you do so. - Louise L. Hay"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Preface by Jerry Hicks Have you ever considered your personal evolution in a light of those events that were a major catalyst to your subsequent feeling of fulfillment? In your album of pleasing memories, have you stored mental pictures of those moments during which you seemed to have been influenced toward becoming, achieving or manifesting what you really wanted to be, do or have? Do you sometimes recall with surging waves of appreciation those persons, books, and seemingly chance circumstances that offered you words or experiences that afforded you a fresh spark of phylosophical clarity? Call those brief experiences turning points, call them crossroads, call them sign posts on your path, or even touchstones to a moment of a particular feeling of Well-Being perhaps. But have you not been aware of their lasting positive effects on your life? I began writing this preface while parked on our dirt trail that runs between the French Broad River and the duck pond. My wife Esther and I have been presenting workshops here in Asheville, NC for fifteen years now. This spot by the river is one of our favourites places to visit as we participate with the spring goslings, and then later the fall migration of thousands of Canadian geese as they knowingly wing their way across the skies, while we too intersect with a changing seasons here as we loop back and forth across this nation. So, here I sit at the most joyous period of my life, during what brings me so much pleasure. I‘m writing this with the deliberate intention of offering you some practicle reasons to put into practice, so you can deliberately experience more of who you really are, the teachings of Abraham. We‘ve been reminded: words don‘t teach – life experience teaches. And although this is a book of words, the powerful ones you‘re about to read here, are going to reveal some upliftting new perspectives to you which you can now allow to become good feeling new beliefs. Your new beliefs can, by the natural Laws of the Universe, in turn generate new and joyous life experiences. And from your elevated experiences of joy you‘ll discover more of the life enhancing knowledge that you‘ve been asking for. I expect that you will find this book to be one of those treasures that you will forever cherish as a clarifying guide to all that you will ever want to be, do or have. If the only awareness that I received from this book was the life changing, for me at least, in-depth understanding that you create your own truth, this book would have served me extremely well. Reading the truths are but beliefs that had been held for a time, and beliefs are but thoughts that had been held over a period of time, has trully emphasized my awareness of the amazing power of thought. Recently I overheard a highly successful anti-panewer stating, when asked how he was capable of achieving such a stupendous degree of success, „I think big. Since I‘m gonna be thinking anyway, I decided long ago - why not think big?“ This is a demonstration of the amazing power of thought. Many years ago I recall reading something written by one of the world‘s most highly regarded geniuses of the 20th century. He said, in effect, „Most humans are only utilizing less than one percent of their true potential. 99 percent of their potential to be, do or have remains forever untapped during their complete lifetime.“ This book, The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent , will reveal the dynamic processes for using more of your untapped potential in this lifetime. Have you ever wondered how much potential for joy lies yet untapped within you? At some level of your consciousness, have you ever been aware that even during your most joyous moments in this life, there‘s so much more joy that you could experience? As magnificent as your body has ever felt for you or performed for you, haven‘t you somehow known that it could be even better? And when you relive those delicious relationship experiences that you shared with those whose lives you‘ve touched as you‘ve grown into the being that is now you, aren‘t you aware that there must be many more delightful relationships with so many more inspiring persons, who are out there waiting for you to attract them into your life experience? In just a few minutes you‘re going to meet Abraham. Teachers of teachers they‘ve called themselves. For those of you who may be new to these teachings, Abraham is referred to in a plural tense, because they are a collective consciousness."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Abraham has been described of some of the most eminent authors and philosophers in the world, as the greatest teachers on our planet today. And when I first met Abraham two decades ago, I too was drawn to their ability to teach. And what I wanted to learn more about was, how can I help others to achieve greater financial success. I recall, while living in a Volkswagen camper, reading Napoleon Hill‘s classic book Think And Grow Rich , where he said, „When riches begin to come, they come so quickly, and in such great abundance, that one wonders where they‘ve been hiding during all those years before.“ Think And Grow Rich certainly gave me what I‘ve been asking for. After discovering that book on a coffee table in a small motel in Montana, and then faithfully utilizing the principles put forth within, my life evolved from earning just enough in the entertaining industry to not have to go to work, to, in a very few years, building and enjoying a multimillion dollar distribution business. To anyone who would listen, I constantly gave the credit for my success to the principals I had learnd in Hill‘s book. The principals worked so well for me, that I soon began using Think And Grow Rich as a textbook to teach my business associates what I‘ve been learning. However, after a few years of doing so, I became aware that only a few of my students had developed multimillion dollar business. Although there were many who did achieve more than modern success, there were some who seemed to achieve almost no financial growth at all. No matter how many financial seminars they attended. About ten years after that, and after reaching all of my original business goals, I began searching for asnwers as to how I could more effectively help more people achieve their desires. And from that asking Esther and I were giving the avenue to these teachings of Abraham. There isn‘t space in this brief preface to explain in any great detail who or what Abraham is, nor how we came to meet them, but if that information is of interest to you, you can experience a free download of a 74 min recording of an Introduction to Abraham by going to our website at www.abraham-hicks.com , or you can order this CD or cassette from our office at Abraham Hicks Publications at P.O. Box 690070, San Antonio, TX 78269, or you can call: Phone: +1 830-755- 2299 Here, however, is an overview of our Abraham experience. Esther and I have been told that by quieting our minds, meditating for 15 minutes a day, we could receive the answers to what we were asking for. And although Esther did experience some extremely strong physical sensations the first time we meditated together, it wasn‘t until after nine months of daily meditation that we experienced any meaningful form of intelectual communication. Intelectual in that as Esther‘s head had begun moving methodically, we discovered that her nose was writing out letters, sort of like spelling out words on an invisible chalkboard in the air: I-A-M-A-B-R-A-H-A-M. To quote Abraham‘s definition of themselves, „Abraham is not a singular consciousness as you feel that you are in your singular bodies. Abraham is a collective consciousness. There is a Nonphysical stream of consciousness, and as one of you ask a question, there are many many points of consciousness that are funneling through what feels to be the one perspective, because there is in this case one human, Esther, who is interpreting, or articulating it. So, it appears singular to you. We are multidimensional and multi-facetted, and certainly multi-consciousness. I began immediately asking questions. And Abraham began answering. At first, by spelling out words, using Esther‘s nose. It later evolved to Esther‘s translating Abraham‘s Nonphysical blocks of thought into our language through her typewriter. And a few months later Esther began speaking words for the thoughts she was receiving from Abraham. A couple of years earlier I had discovered the Seth material. Jane Roberts and Robert Butts had received in a similar manner these wildly published books. As such, I understood somewhat what was happening to us. But as far as we knew, neither of us where asking for nor expecting to receive the experience for ourselves. I was expecting and asking for ways to more effectively teach others how to achieve more successful lives. But not through this avenue. Both Esther and I wanted the wisdom that Abraham was so willing to offer us, but we were both apprehensive as to how something as seemingly strange as this phenomenon would fit into our already well established"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"business procedures and perspectives. For me my business principals had to be learnable, teachable. My often stated intent was that each person whom I touched would be either elevated or would remain basicly where they were when I met them. And it was my intention, and it still is, that no- one would ever be diminished as a result of coming into contact with me. For Esther, the principal simply had to prove to feel good when put into practice. Esther at first experienced a more or less natural physical resistance to allowing the Abraham experience. For instance, when this speaking for Abraham began, she would sit in a chair, eyes tightly closed, hands clenched on the arms of the chair with their voice projecting from that taut physical posture in a seemingly strident tone. As the years passed, and as the asking of thousands upon thousands of people continued to evoke Abraham‘s answers through Esther, her body began to physically relax. First, her eyes opened. Then her hands and arms began to gesture. And then, a few years later, her body progressed from sitting to standing, braced by a chair or a lectern, to moving gracefully from place to place. Concurrently with the relaxing of Esther‘s body came the relaxing of her voice. If you were to hear one of our earlier recordings, you would distinguish what you might describe as a foreign accent of some unknown origin. But today, after nearly 20 years of relaxing into speaking for Abraham, the voice you would hear would not sound very different than Esther‘s. What you would notice as different would be what I would term Abraham‘s intelectual and attitudinal stances. One more point before I conclude this preface. If you‘ve read our previous book Ask And It Is Given , you‘ve already learned that Abraham teaches that we‘re here having this physical Earth experience for the creative joy of the journey. And that we are not here to try to fix anything or get anything done. Abraham teaches that everything that anyone of us ever wants or does is only because we believe that in achieving of it we will feel better than we do now. And Abraham tells us that there is nothing more important than that we feel good. So, if we‘re not here to fix something or to get something done, how can we know if our life on Earth has been a success? Abraham teaches us, that success is not measured by the physical things we accomplish or the stuff we gather. They tell us that our success is measured by the degree of joy we‘re experiencing during our journey through this life. And so, if you‘re looking for evidence of someone‘s success in utilizing the teachings of Abraham, simply pay attention to the amount of joy they are experiencing in the moment. For all that anyone of us ever says, does, or attempts to be, whatever it is, is only because we want to reach a state of feeling better. You may have already discovered that wealth, health, relationships or physical accomplishments aren‘t what bring you happiness. But you may be amazed to learn that by deliberately finding and maintaining your vibrational balance on your intended pathway of joy, you‘ll also be attracting whatever you want to be, do or have. And you can have the happiness too. Esther and I have for two decades now used the teachings of Abraham to maintain our fun filled relationship with one another. We‘ve attracted a staff of brilliant delightful extremely capable emplyees and independent contractors, who allow the business aspects of the evolution of this philosophy to smoothly flow and grow. We‘ve also attracted spectacular friends and business associates while not forgoing the joy of the memories of those with whome we no longer personally interact. Our health is perfect. No doctors, except as friends. No medical examinations and no medical insurance. Yes, physical glitches sometimes occur, but they very shortly resolve themselves as we return to energy balance. Financially we paid more taxes last year than the total profits received from all of our years before we learned the principals of deliberate intentions. In other words, it works. And, above all, I know of no two happier people, with the exception maybe of our grandchildren Laurel, Kevin and Kate. Esther and I travel this nation presenting art of allowing workshops to thousands of people in up to 60 cities a year. We drive our Monster Bus - it‘s a marathon conversion of a 45 foot long tour bus – and printed across the back in very large friendly letters is LIFE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN. Perhaps you felt it too. But from the time I was five years old, I can remember having desires to somehow help others live happier lives. And so, as my life evolved, I found many varied avenues of expression to perform many versions of that. As I write this for you, I‘m feeling such appreciation for those persons, far too many to even consider mentioning here, who have have been an influence in my joyous life expwrience. And although I"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"probably can credit the teachings of Abraham for actually attracting Abraham, I do credit them for the massive physical evolution of this message. I also credit them for the degree of joy that Esther and I experience as we‘re blessed with this opportunity to create different means of projecting their joy-based philosophy of practical spirituality to you. - From my heart, Jerry"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"An Introduction to Abraham by Esther Hicks Hello, my name is Esther, and I'm the translator of the vibration of Abraham. Abraham has explained to me that I'm able to receive, at an unconscious level of my human Being, their vibrational intent. They tell me that I'm receiving these signals, like those emitted by a radio, at an unconscious level, and then translating them into the word equivalent. They've explained to me that I'm bridging the physical world, in which I am focused, with the Non-Physical world in which they are focused. They told me, in the beginning of my receiving of them, that I was a particularly good translator for them because I didn't have strong biases or opinions that would make it difficult for me to receive them clearly. They said that it wasn't so much that I hadn't made up my mind about anything, as it was that I wasn't pushing hard against anything. I was, for the most part, just taking life as it came, and I was in a particularly good vibrational place when I made my first contact with Abraham. Abraham has explained that everyone has the ability to receive information from the Non-Physical, as I'm doing with Abraham. Just as we all have access to writing beautiful music or painting beautiful pictures, it's all there for all of us to tap in to at any time from any physical vantage point. And just as there's enormous variety in the way people translate music or art-there's enormous variety in the way people interpret Non-Physical Energy. Understanding that, we always document what I translate from Abraham as Abraham-Hicks in an effort to distinguish my unique translation from anyone else's. Abraham suggested to me, in the beginning of my translating for them, that I not read what others have written or what others are writing, for they wanted my interpretation of them (Abraham) to be uncluttered by opinions of others. They didn't want me to worry that I was unconsciously picking up information from other books or people. They wanted me to feel assured that I was, in fact, a pure translator of what they were offering. Now, all these years later, from time to time I've picked up something or other that someone has sent us, and I can always feel the vibrational compatibility, or lack of it, when I read. Abraham has assured me that at this point I'm in no danger of hindering my ability to hear them accurately when I read, but I can feel that it often takes some time to get myself really tuned in to their pure thought. So, while many people lovingly send us books, manuscripts, or information in a variety of formats, I prefer not to read any of it, for it's my intention to translate as clearly as possible what Abraham is projecting through me. Abraham has explained to me that thought-by-thought, sentence-by-sentence, discussion-by- discussion, we (Abraham and Esther) have found accurate and unique ways of explaining their teachings that continue to expand and clarify. As they offer a block of thought, I do the best job I can (unconsciously) of finding physical words that most accurately depict their meaning. And when my words and Abraham's meanings match, off we go on some powerful, interesting, and clarifying rampage. And every time that subject is approached, the clarification increases. What fun this has been for me! I can sense the love, power, and joy that Abraham feels in their process of speaking through me. Nearly every day we receive yet another request from somewhere in the world to present another Abraham-Hicks seminar, and our schedule of events grows a little more every year. However, at this point, it isn't possible to do something more unless we stop doing something we're already doing. Jerry and I see our work as meeting with as many people as we can (in a question-and-answer format) so that Abraham's message can continue to expand, and there's nothing that we enjoy more than being in a room full of eager Art of Allowing workshop attendees who've come to us with their newly refined questions for Abraham. The questions that people bring to Abraham, as well as those that erupt from our personal lives, are what cause Abraham's message to continue to clarify and expand. And whenever Abraham offers a suggestion of any kind, Jerry and I always do our best to understand it and apply it to our own lives. Over the years, Abraham has offered many processes-they lovingly tell us that they're eternal"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"spewers of processes. So whenever they offer one, I always watch for an opportunity in my own life to apply it-and I always receive immediate and satisfying results from my efforts. When I look at the wonderful way we're living, see the amazing results we're experiencing in every area of our lives, feel the security that comes from understanding that we do create our own reality, and feel the satisfaction of having created such a wonderful reality, I want everyone to come to know what we've already discovered. We hold approximately 60 workshops every year, and we drive from city to city in our amazing motor coach that Abraham lovingly refers to as the \"monster bus.\" We continue to find lovely places to park, take our walks, and write our books. For finding a place where we feel wonderful is an important key to relaxing, and to receiving from Abraham. When we're at home in Texas, I have many quiet, private, and beautiful places to choose from where I can sit and receive Abraham's message. But my favorite, always, is our amazing tree house. I always feel happy anticipation of what Abraham will have to say as I climb up into the treetops with my laptop computer and settle into the delicious Energy of Abraham. As I closed my eyes and relaxed, waiting to begin receiving what I knew would be another wonderful book, Abraham said to me: Esther, these words will flow easily. So many readers are reading Ask and It Is Given, and their questions for clarifications are already reaching us. Therefore, writing this book, which is a different book, yet a continuation of the first one, will flow easily for you. Enjoy this process. We are enjoying your enjoyment of your tree house. Now, let us begin.. And so, off we go.. - Esther"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Chapter 1. A new way of looking at life Contrary to what many of our physical friends believe, life on planet Earth is at its all time best and getting better. This powerful and accurate statement is not only based on our observation of the intricate details of life on Earth, but also on our knowledge of the powerful laws of the universe, and our understanding that all things are eternally expanding and improving. People often complain about modern life, stating that it lacks something they remember enjoying in earlier times, and they long to return to those eras or conditions. But we never look to the past for better times, for we understand that what‘s happening now and what is coming next will always contain the best that life has to offer. People often misunderstand their role in this magnificent process of eternal expansion, humbly seeing themselves as insignificant in the larger scheme of things. Some believe that God or some Higher Power has created all things, including them, and that now they are here on planet Earth working to achieve a more godly state or to achieve God‘s approval. Others have decided that the world is Godless, and so they therefore strive to please no-one. From our broader non-physical ventage point we understand the power, purpose and value of the human being, the human mind and the human thought, for we know that you are the leading edge of thought. We understand the value of the variety in which you are living and the purpose of the contrast that you observe. We feel the clarity that arises from your focus in your environment, and we revel in the expansion of thought that results from your exposure to your life experiences. We understand creation and we understand the power of thought. You‘re not here in your physical body striving to achieve the non-physical, for you‘re not seperate from non-physical. You are an extension, a leading edge extension of that non-physical energy. Yoe‘re not here on planet Earth trying to get back to what is non-physical, but instead you‘re summoning the non-physical outward to where you are. And in that summoning All- that-is expands, and your summoning is the reason for the expansion. Your every preference is heard and answered As you live your life aware of your environment and all its contrasting components, a natural process of clarifying your personal preferences ocurrs. Sometimes these preferences are so fully conscious, that you speak of them in terms of your desires, and sometimes they are more subtle and no words are spoken, for these preferences happen at many levels of your being. Even the cells of your body are points of consciousness who are experiencing contrast and clarifying their preferences. In fact, everything around you – your animals, your trees, even your rocks, dirt and dust – are actually pulsing living consciousnesses, who are experiencing contrast and who have preferences. And these living pulsing preferences have summoning power. In simpler terms we like to say, when you ask it is given. It is always given. It is given every time, no exceptions. When you, or anyone, or anything asks, it is given. And this simple process of exposure to experience, which causes consciousness to clarify personal preferences, sets a vibrational summoning into motion that causes the eternal expansion of the universe. When you realize that everything you see around you in your time-space reality is consciousness, and that every point of consciousness is having an experience in which its own preferences are born, and that every preference is heard and answered, then you must understand, as we do, that all is very well. You are a powerful leading edge creator. You‘re on the leading edge of thought, experience and expansion. You‘re certainly not alone in this, for all that has come before you is aware of where you are, what you‘re doing and what you‘re asking for. The non-physical aspect of this leading edge you is experiencing expansion also, reveling in the new ideas and joyously joining you as you continue to move into your powerful future. It is our desire that you remember all that you are so that you can enjoy this leading edge ventage point in the way you intended as you decided to come forth into this physical body. You are not inferior beings in need of enlightment, you are not incignificant particals in a vast unending"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"universe, you are not misguided or forgotten children trying to find your way home. You are powerful leading edge creators, riding the most significant wave of expansion that has ever occured. And it is our desire that you return to your conscious awareness of this so that your time in this physical body can be one of deliberate conscious joy."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Chapter 2. Life on planet Earth continues to get better Each generation living on your planet benefits from the life experiences of previous generations. We suppose that this statement seems obvious to most who would read it, however, it‘s a much more powerful statement then most would understand at first glance. When you contemplate this statement from your awareness of the Law of Attraction – that which is like unto itself is drawn, - and when you remember that everything that exists in your physical time-space reality exists because of a focussed asking from this tme-space reality, you begin to get a sense of the importance of all who have been focussed, all who have lived contrast and of all who have been asking, asking for answers to questions, resolutions to problems, improvements to situations and fulfilment of desires. This living of the contrast, which causes a focusing of desire, calls forth a creative energy of the universe and is, in fact, what causes all life to evolve. It would be accurate to say that this living of contrast equals the asking, or desire, that summons the energy that is life. There is great satisfaction in deliberate creation We have been speaking often about the creative process and we‘ve been explaining that you are the creator of your own experience. And many are beginning to make the absolute correlation between what they‘re thinking and how that thought feels and what then manifests in response to that focus. And as many around the world are becoming students of deliberate creation, focusing intentionally towards specific personal creations, they‘re finding great satisfaction in doing that. We enjoy seeing our physical friends deliberately focusing their thoughts, while considering the emotional response to those thoughts, thereby guiding their creation of their own life experiences into more and more pleasing outcomes. There‘s great satisfaction in doing that. We enjoy seeing our physical friends living situations not wanted, then deliberately modifying their focus, thereby shifting the way they feel, thereby changing their point of attraction, and thereby receiving different more satisfying results. There‘s great satisfaction in doing that. So, focusing intentionaly is deliberate creation. And there‘s great satisfaction in deliberately creating pleasing outcomes. It‘s satisfying to change the condition of one‘s body from sickness to health. It‘s satisfying to attract and allow more money for the purchase of many satisfying things. It is satisfying to change relationships, to live in new houses, and to drive new vehicles. It is satisfying to have control over all the physical trappings of one‘s own life experience. The art of allowing – your deliberate intent Not so long ago we encouraged Jerry and Esther to change the name of the Abraham-Hicks seminars from „The science of deliberate creation“ to „The art of allowing“. Because deliberate creating is about much more than happy outcomes or improved conditions. Deliberate creating really is about allowing your own personal connection with the stream of Well-Being and with all that you consider to be good. While creation is certainly about outcomes or the manifestation of wanted things, experiences and conditions, it‘s really more about the process of creation. In other words, it‘s wonderful to attract and therefore to possess a beautiful new vehicle, but life is really about the process of doing so. Life is really about beginning to feel the slight tugging of dissatisfaction with your current vehicle and then feeling the gentle process of clarifying personal preferences regarding something different, and then aligning with the idea and details of the desired vehicle, and then consciously witnessing the movement of forces and situations to accommodate the acquisition. Life is really about the ongoing, neverending refocusing from each new ventage point. Life is always flowing to you and through you, but for you to have conscious deliberate awareness"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"of it is the ultimate and trully living. Accomplishing an end result is manifestation. Consciously managing and maintaining your vibrational balance is deliberate living, and it is really what we call living the art of allowing. Your amazing power of deliberate intent So, this leading-edge book is really about understanding the importance of having a deliberate intent for an end result, while at the same time tending to the balance of your energy along the way. But it‘s much more about an awareness of the balance of your energy then it is about goal setting or focusing on end results. And it‘s from this very important distinction that this book „The amazing power of deliberate intent“ has come forth. As you come to understand and effectively practise the processes offered here, you will not only achieve your desired goals and outcomes more rapidly, but you will enjoy every single step along the path, even before the manifestation of your desires. Living your life will be an ongoing journey of joy rather than one of experiencing long dry spells between occasional moments of temporary satisfaction in achieving of something wanted."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Chapter 3. Death, as another new beginning Most people do not have an accurate sense of who they really are. They‘re not really sure where they‘ve come from or where they‘re going. And, most important, they do not have a sense of why they are here on planet Earth or the reason for being here. We offer you our awareness of who you are and how you fit into the larger picture of All-That-Is because we understand how important that perspective can be for you. Once you remember who you are and regain your sense of total continuity of where you‘ve come from, and where your‘re going, your powerful Now will become infinitely more satisfying. Perhaps the easiest route to your understanding of the fullness of your being is for us to begin with the discussion of your physical death. That may seem a bit odd to you if you‘re one of our physical friends who sees death as the end of your life experience. However, we do not see what you call your death experience as the end of anything, for you are an eternal being who has no end. Just as what you call death is not the end of your life experience, what you call birth was not the beginning. You are eternal consciousness expressing yourself in an endless glorious dance of consciousness. Yuo will never seize to be. When you experience what you call physical death – we clarify those words carefully, since there is no such thing as death, - you withdraw your consciousness from the powerful point of focus that you know as your physical personality and focus fully into the non-physical realm. And in the moment of that change of focus you leave behind all feelings of inferiority, all doubt, all worry, all hate, all anger and in a moment in time, too short to measure, you‘ll re-emerge back into the joyous, pure, positive energy perspective that is really who you are. When you make a decision to come forth into a physical body, only a part of the consciousness that is you is temporarily focused into that body. When you experience physical death, that pointed consciousness is withdrawn from the physical and refocused into the non-physical. You are here with deliberate intent Focusing consciousness into a physical body is not something that‘s taken lightly from the non- physical point of view. It‘s with clear and deliberate intent that you decide to project consciousness into this time-space reality. And it is with great enthusiasm that you come forth into these bodies. You are filled with eager anticipation for a number of reasons: you know that you‘re an eternal being, you understand the value of your being, you‘re fully cognizant of who you are, you do not doubt your value or your worthiness, you understand that life in this time-space reality is the leading-edge of thought, you know that you‘re coming into an environment that is stable, you know that Well-Being is the dominant order in this environment, you know that this is an environment with a tremendous variety of interesting components, you understand the laws of the universe and the basis of creation. You are master creator and you know it. You like the experience of creating. You know that you are good at it. You understand and appreciate the law of attraction, you know its fairness and you appreciate its consistency. You are eager to dawn your new perspective so that the environment that surrounds you can inspire your new personal preferences and desires. You enjoy the sensation of a fresh new desire. You understand the universal response to your fresh new desire. You relish the feeling of desire summoning to you and through you. You understand that this feeling of desire is the feeling of life. You do not worry about contrast, for you understand its purpose. You know that its through your interaction with contrast and variety that your own desires will be formulated. With no reservations whatsoever you eagerly anticipate the new awareness of desire that is the inevitable result of this leading-edge participation in life. You come forth not in anticipation of the completion of anything, for you wisely remember the eternal nature of yourself and of All-That-Is. You know that life will eternally expand and that it‘s not your purpose or the purpose of anyone to complete it or finish it. You understand that expansion is the natural result of your focusing to contrast, because you know that the contrast will cause you to ask. You know that"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"when you ask, it‘s always given. Therefore you have no desire to avoid contrast because you understand the focusing power of contrast. You know that variety and contrast will cause you to determine the specifics of your personal preferences, and you know that each of those preferences – big or small – will be answered in the moment they‘re born. And so, an appreciation of your contrasting environment is necessary for you to consciously experience the continuum of who you really are. You came here expecting to produce new desires We want to help you reclaim the eagerness and the anticipation you felt for this joyous life experience when you entered into this physical body in this time-space reality. You did not come forth to fix something that was broken or to help redirect the misguided world. You did not come forth to prove your worthiness or to earn a reward for efforts offered while here in this body. You came here with full knowledge of your value and worthiness and with knowledge of the perfection of worlds, physical and non-physical, into a contrasting environment that you knew would produce fresh new personal desires. Desires with a power to summon energy, consciousness and All-That-Is forward into this new leading-edge creation. You knew that you‘re life in a process of living life in the creation of more life, and, most important, you knew, and your non-physical part still knows, that the reason for all of all of all of that is JOY."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Chapter 4. You are vibrational extensions of the non-physical As you‘ve come to know yourself in your physical body, if you‘re like most of our physical friends, you do not really know youself as we know you. You see your physical nature – the flesh, blood and bone of you, so to speak. And certainly we acknowledge that you are all of that. But even more than the physical manifestation that you know as your body, we know you as consciousness, as vibration and as an extension of the energy stream of Source. You are far more vibration and energy than you are the physical being that you recognize as you. And it is only when you understand yourself as a vibrational being that you‘ll be able to akcnowledge the vibrational energy continuum that is really you. And it‘s really only in the conscious realization of that continuum that you‘ll be able to fulfil your true reason for being here in this body or to trully enjoy yourself in the process. Often people feel disoriented when they try to see themselves as vibration or as energy, because they are accustomed to observing only the physical manifestations of those vibrations. In your observation of your world and all of its physical characteristics it‘s easy to get so envolved in the results of the vibrations that you disregard the vibrations that are responsible for those results. Emotions indicate your non-physical relativity Your physical body was born with such precise and sophisticated vibrational interpreters that you‘re often unaware that you have them or that you use them to define your physical reality. But this is a vibrational world and everything you perceive is because of your ability to interpret vibration. Your eyes interpret vibration and therefore you have the sense of sight. Your ears interpret vibration and therefore you have the sense of hearing. Your nose interprets vibration and therefore you have the sense of smell. Your skin interprets vibration and therefore you have the sense of feeling. Your tongue interprets vibration and therefore you have the sense of taste. Your ability to understand the continuity of who you are as an eternal non-physical being and who you are here in your physical body comes through the vibrational interpreters that you call emotions. Your emotions in every moment give you an indication of the vibrational relationship between the non-physical you and the physical you. Nothing is more important to you than this relationship. And nothing can enhance your physical experience more than an understanding of your emotions, for they tell you everything you need to know about the relationship between the physical you and the non-physical you. Connection – your most natural state of being With your deliberate intention and some practice you will not only have an awareness of your relationship with your non-physical self but you‘ll be able to maintain a constant vibrational alignment with that non-physical self. We call that conscious state of deliberate vibrational alignment with your Source Energy „the art of allowing“. It‘s the art of allowing the fullness of who you are to be present in this powerful leading-edge moment. Whenever you achieve this wonderful connection, you feel more alive, you feel eagerness, passion, love, appreciation, clarity, vitality and enthusiasm. In other words, you allow yourself the benefit of all that you‘ve become to be present in this leading-edge moment of creation. It‘s the optimal creative experience, it‘s the optimal expression of life, and it is your most natural state of being. So this connection to who you really are is achieved by vibrational alignment. It is a matching of vibrational signals, so to speak, not so different from what you understand when you tune your radio dial to a special radio frequency to hear a music being broadcast from a particular station. You understand that if you wanna hear"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"what‘s being broadcast from 98.7 FM, you must match your tunner or receiver to 98.7 FM. Their frequences must match in order for you to have clear reception. Although your physical body is not equiped with the dial or a meter that tells you the frequency you‘re broadcasting, your emotions do provide that equivalent information. As you pay attention to your emotions, you literally feel your way to your vibrational alignment with your Source."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Chapter 5. You came here to create your own experience Once you make a conscious connection between your physical personality, what you know as you here in this body, and the eternal non-physical consciousness, what is really you, you can then get on with the reason you were born into this physical life experience. An awareness of the continuity of you, an awareness that you did not just begin with this physical birth, but that this is but a continuation of who you really are, is vital to living this life experience in anything close to a satisfying, fulfilling way. Another important component of a satisfying physical life experience is a recognition of your value and your worthiness. And you can achieve that awareness only through an actual connection with that non-physical part of you. In other words, if you do not consciously realize who you really are, and manage to vibrationally align with who you really are, there‘s no other physical substitute for that connection. Some try to fill that feeling of void that‘s present when they‘re not vibrationally aligned with their non-physical Inner-Being, Consciousness, God, Source, or Energy – there are many different names for that non-physical part of you – in a variety of ways. Some seek approval from others, some seek that approval by attempting to modify the behaviour in order to conform to rules or guidelines of one group or another. And some work hard to excel in their personal behaviour by comparing their behaviour to that of others‘ they‘re observing. But there‘s no substitute for your vibrational alignment with you. Vibrational alignment with who you really are Nothing is more important than the vibrational alignment or maintenance of the continuum between you and you, for your every moment is impacted by your connection, or lack of connection, to your Inner-Being, to the total you that you have become, to the you that you were before you were born into this physical body. Once you understand who you really are, and you consciously work to achieve and maintain your vibrational alignment with who you really are, everything else in your life will fall into wonderful alignment. However, if you do not tend to that connection, nothing that you can do will fill the void or take the place of that alignment. Sometimes you‘re influenced into your alignment by observing something wonderful, or because you‘re interacting with someone else who‘s experiencing their own alignment. Sometimes you stumble into your alignment without realizing you‘re doing it, maybe through your appreciation of something. But to have conscious awareness of the value of your alignment and to understand how to achieve it and how to maintain it is the optimal life experience. We call that deliberate creation. Inner-Being and your emotional guidance system Your awareness of the vibrational variance between what you‘re vibrationally offering in this moment and the vibrational offering of your Inner-Being is literally your emotional guidance system. And when you think of the continuum between you and you, this makes perfect sense. You are an extension of the Source Energy you. And here you are, out here on this leading-edge of thought, focusing upon some subject. And as you focus your perspective upon this subject, you offer a vibrational frequency which either matches or does not match the frequency of the way your Inner-Being you sees it. For example, let us say that you make a mistake as you‘re doing your work today. You discover your msitake and you correct it, but then you belittle yourself or feel guilty about your error. You use the making of the mistake as your reason to think unkindly about yourself, and in doing so you deviate from the loving frequency of the Inner you. But the non- physical part of you – that God force, Source Energy, Inner-Being, or whatever name you assign to that eternal non-physical energy from which you have come forth – never under any conditions"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"feels anything less than love and appreciation for that which you are. Once you learn to recognise the feelings of alignment and relationaship to the feelings of misalignment, you can begin to effectively use your emotional guidance system. You could say, „I‘m aligned“, or „misaligned with the energy of my Source“, „I‘m connected, or not connected to the energy of my Source“, „I‘m allowing, or resisting the energy of my Source“. This conscious awareness of the way you feel is the only consistant true indicator of your allowing the wholeness of you to be present in this moment. And although others may inspire or influence you, you can not count on the influence of any other for your indication of connection. There are too many other factors in the lives that they are living for you to depend on them to help you maintain your connection. To feel for your state of balanced energy Achieving a conscious awareness of your in this moment vibrational relationship with the vibration of your Source is fundamental to your happy life and to the deliberate creation of your own life. Feeling for the vibrational match between the thoughts you‘re having in this moment and the thoughts that your Inner-Being is having about this moment is what deliberate connection realy is. And when you‘re able to consciously feel the vibrational discord, or alignment, between those two vibrational vantage points, you‘re being conscious awareness of your own emotinal guidance system. Deliberately reaching for thoughts that cause your two vibrational vantage points to align is the true meaning of the balancing of energy. When you line up with you, you experience the balancing of your own energy and you come into alignment with the true power of your Being. There is no substitute for this alignment. From your state of balanced energy you experience clarity, vitality, eagerness, physical wellness, abundace in all things you consider to be good and an exuberant state of joy. This is the natural state of who you really are."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. The attracted power of your creative thought Although you may not yet be completely aware of your vibrational nature, you are a vibrational being, living in a vibrational universe. In fact, everything is vibrational. As you give your attention to something – an idea, a memory, a situation you‘re observing, a dream, or fantasy that you‘re visualizing – you‘re actually activating vibration. And as your focus causes that activation, that vibrational content now becomes your point of attraction. Whenever you think about anything, its vibrational content becomes an active part of your vibrational essence, and the subject of your attention begins to move towards you. Most people do not realize that thinking about something is inviting the essence of that something into their experience. Of course, when you made the decision to come forth into this body, you understood the vibrational nature of your world and of this universe, and you were enthusiastic about it, for you believed in your ability to deliberately focus. Knowledge of the vibrational nature of your universe is both, comforting and exhilarating. Comforting in the sense that you know that you have nothing to fear, because nothing can come to you without your invitation of it. And exhilarating in the sense that you know that you can draw anything that you desire close to you for your joyful experiencing of it. When you realize that you are the vibrational attractor of all things that come to you, and that you do have control of what comes, your world opens to new horizons. There is no need to limit your experience in a guarded or protective stance, for no unwanted thing can force or sort itself into your experience. You are the creator of your own experience, and no-one else has power within your experience, and that is true for everyone. The powerful universal Law of Attraction (LOA) In the same way that the law of gravity consistently responds to all of the physical matter of your planet, the LOA consistently responds to all vibrations. Every projection of thought, whether you‘re focused into the past, present or future, is vibration and has attraction power. Each thought offers a signal, similar to radio signal, that the LOA recognizes and matches. This powerful consistent LOA – that which is like unto itself is drawn – offers consistent results in response to the vibrations that you offer. There are no arbitrary inconsistent responses that would make the LOA impossible to understand. It is consistent, it is fair, it is always responsive, it is powerful, it is a deliberate creator‘s best friend. Your awareness of the powerful consistency of the LOA and your understanding of how it works, coupled with a conscious utilization of your emotional guidance system, puts you in a powerful position of creating a wonderful joyous life. Choosing your objects of attention deliberately and refining the specifics of your focus by utilizing your emotional guidance system, renders you a powerful deliberate creator, who is fulfilling your intention for this physical life experience. For you are now allowing the perspective of your Source to be present in this leading-edge experience, as you ride the glorious wave of taking thought beyond that which it has been before. Yours is a unique and personal life experience Although you may know others who seem to be having similar experiences, you are living a unique life experience. In other words, as you move about your world, interacting with a components of your time-space reality, experiencing the variety and contrast that surrounds you, you automaticly and constantly clarify personal preferences. And as you stand in your unique leading-edge perspective, your unique preferences and desires are erupting within you and causing vibrational signals to emanate from you. And as those vibrations through the LOA summon vibrational"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"matches unto themselves, everything that you are, and everything that your Inner-Being, or Source, is, experiences the expansion of that summoning. The non-physical part of you revels in the exhilaration of this ground-breaking expansion, for there is no more joyous place in all of existance to be than on this leading-edge place experiencing this new awareness firsthand. We write this book because it‘s our desire that you experience firsthand the joy of this leading-edge perspective. We want you to experience the exhilaration of standing on the leading-edge of thought fully conscious of the speed of life flowing through you. Future generations will benefit from the desires that are now emanating from you, and from their subsequent attraction power, but it is our desire that you receive the benefit of them, too. Right here, right now."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Chapter 7. You are manifesting the essence of what you‘re thinking about When you begin to understand the vibrational nature of thought and the way the LOA response to it, you then begin to understand how it is that you are the creator of your own reality. Everything about your life is coming to you in response to the focus of your thoughts, but until you understand the vibrational nature of your thoughts and discover a comparative way of recognizing them, you have no deliberate control over your own experience. Deliberate creation is much more than just deliberately choosing a subject of attention and focusing upon it. For while it‘s a good thing to deliberately choose the subject of your attention, you must also feel for the vibrational content of your thought, in order to really be in deliberate control of your creating. For example, you may be focused upon the subject of financial abundance, but this subject, like all subjects, has great variety within it. On one extreme of the subject is the thought of the presence of financial abundance, while on the other extreme of the subject is the thought of the absence of financial abundance. And so, in a simplistic sense, every subject could be seen as two subjects – what is wanted and the lack of what is wanted. Each subject has a varied vibrational range. When we say to our physical friends, you get what you think about, sometimes they feel confusion, for they believe that they‘ve been thinking about achieving more money, a healthier body, a better relationship or more satisfying work. People will sometimes argue that they‘ve been definitely thinking about more money, and they do not understand why, if what we say is true, more money is not coming into their experience. But the subject of money has varied vibrational range. The subject of money ranges from a magnificent, ever-flowing abundance all the way to the desperate absence of abundance. So, merely focusing upon the subject or the idea of money is but the beginning of the necessary focusing, or molding, of the vibrational energy, required to bring money into your experience. Directing your thought to the subject of money is a good first step, but then it‘s necessary to understand where, on this wide range of vibrational possibilities, relative to the subject of money, you actually are. Which end of this vibrational range are you leaning toward? Are you a closer match to the magnificent abundance or are you a closer match to the desperate absence of abundance? You can easily answer this question when you understand your emotions, for it is through emotional awareness that you understand the vibrational content of your thoughts. The way you feel as you‘re focusing thought is really what matters most. How does the thought feel to you? Some are beginning to acknowledge, you get what you think about. But we would like to clarify that statement further by saying, you get what you feel about what you think about. So where are you on the sliding scale of possible vibrations relative to the subject of money? You may often say that you want more money, but if you consistently feel disappointment or fear about not having enough money, then your vibrational offering regarding money does not match your statement of desire. And wherever your vibrational offering is, is where your point of attraction is. What is actually happening in your experience relative to the subject of money, always matches the essence of your vibrational offering. Observing what is manifesting or happening to you can give an accurate reading of where you are in the vibrational scale of possibilities, and that awareness can be extremely helpful. But it‘s possible for you to be aware of where you are on the vibrational scale before things manifest or occur in your experience. And that‘s a much more satisfying way to approach the deliberate control of your life experience."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"It is never too late to change direction You can either be aware of your point of attraction post-manifestation, after it happens, or pre- manifestation, before it happens. Of course, we encourage having conscious awareness at all times about the direction you‘re headed. It would be like travelling in your vehicle, having a particular destination in mind, being on the wrong road altogether, and travelling in the opposite derection of your desired destination, but having no awareness that you‘re going in the wrong direction, until you arrive to the wrong place. You can always correct your course. But the sooner you‘re aware that you‘re off your path, the better and more satisfying your journey will be. The key to joyful deliberate creating is to choose the subjects of your thought intentionally, while paying close attention to how each thought feels. For less you‘re aware of how the thought feels, you have no understanding of where you are on the sliding scale of vibrational possibilities."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Chapter 8. When you ask, it is always given When you made the decision to come forth into this physical body in this time-space reality, you understood the unlimited abundance of this environment. You felt no competition whatsoever from those with whom you would share this planet, for you understood fully that your environment is capable of expanding in proportion to the desires that are born from the exposure to it. You reveled in the idea of interacting with many others, and experiencing a diverse spectrum of intentions, ideas, beliefs and desires. You understood the value of the vast variety in contrast, for you knew that it would stimulate your thought. You knew that it‘s only from exposure to contrast that any preferences or desires can be born. And you well understood the value of giving birth to desires, for you understood the summoning power of desires. You knew that whenever you ask, it is always given, without exception. Let‘s concider this from a vibrational stand point. You have an awareness of your environment, which stimulates your own personal preferences. Those preferences, whether you speak them out loud or not, cause you to offer a vibration emanation, an asking, and the powerful LOA answers your vibration emanation with other vibration offerings that match them. You launched a rocket of desire, but... It seems simple enough: contrast produces desire, all desires are answered. So, if this is correct, then anyone who desires anything should be the swift receiver of that desire. So how can it be that you can have the desire for more money, or an improved bodily condition, and not get it? The answer to this often asked question lies in your awareness of your vibrational sliding scale. An intense situation could cause the launching of a powerful desire, and in the moment of the launching of that desire you are, for that brief time, a vibrational match to it. In fact, it‘s usually such a brief time of vibrational alignment, that we call it the rocket of desire. But if, over time, you‘ve often been offering thoughts that have registered somewhere else on the vibrational scale, then you‘ve most likely practised yourself into a pattern or habit of thought, that is quite different from what you are now asking for. Whenever you think a thought, you activate that thought vibration within you. Whenever a vibration is activated, other thoughts that match it come to it, making it easier and easier for you to think that thought. As you often return your focus to that activated thought, it becomes a dominant activated thought, or a belief. A belief is really only a thought that you keep thinking. And of cource the LOA makes it easy for you to continue to think the thought, because you‘re focused upon it, and the subsequent activation of the vibration of it cause the LOA to bring you more thoughts like it, and therefore more evidence of it."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Chapter 9. Truth is all about your focus You may now more fully comprehend that you are a vibrational being, that you do create your own reality. Furthermore, you‘re now coming to understand that you create your own reality through the focus of your thoughts, because your thoughts are vibrations and the LOA responds to those vibrations. Therefore, anytime you‘re focusing upon anything (past, present or future), you are in the process of creation. When your attention is focused upon something that you‘re observing in your present moment, something you‘re considering, pondering or remembering from your past, something you‘re explaining, or something you‘re imagining, or fantasizing, you‘re offering a vibration, and the LOA is responding to that vibration. And each time you revisit that subject, the process of attracting other vibrations of the same frequency increases, so your signal about that subject gets stronger. The more you‘re focused upon a subject, the more active that vibration is. And the more active the vibration is, the more of that which is a vibrational match to it is attracted to it. Eventually you‘ll begin to see physical evidence showing up in your experience that matches the essence of the way you‘ve been feeling about this subject. You are the creator of your own truth As you consider any idea, you activate a vibration about it, and the LOA then offers you other ideas that have the same vibrational frequency. As you continue to ponder this subject, more thoughts that match those thoughts come to you. And as the ativation of this idea continues, it becomes stronger, and the attraction power of the idea increases. In time things will begin to occur in your life experience that match those ideas. Usually at that point you call the experience factual, or truthful. And no-one could deny that it is factual, or truthful, for the physical evidence is right there before you, supporting it. But instead of calling it truth, or fact, we call it creation. We call it the natural universal response to your consistently activated vibration. There is no value in focusing upon unwanted things, causing an activation of a vibration within you, that the LOA will respond to, and therefore creating in your reality something you do not want. Often people will explain that their rational of the giving their attention to a subject is because the subject is true. But although there are many subjects that are true, that you would like to personaly experience, there‘re also many subjects that are true, that you would not like to personaly experience. It‘s not important whether it‘s true or not, but whether or not you want to experience the truth of it in your experience. Anything, focused upon long enough, must become truth. It is law."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Chapter 10. Awareness as your key to deliberate creation Your thriving will be immediately enhanced in the moment you understand and begin to utilize your own emotional guidance system. Through your continual exposure to life experience you‘re stimulated to constant awareness, which means that you‘re focusing upon something all day every day, and that focus is causing an activation of vibration within you. Most people do not realize that they are vibrational beings living in a vibrational universe, and most are not aware that they‘re vibrationally attracting their own reality. And so, most people make little or no effort to deliberately focus thought. In this fast paced environment with so much to consider, it would be no small task to have conscious awareness of every thought. In fact, sifting and sorting of all this data is not possible. Fortunately, you do not have to sort the plethora of thoughts that are moving through you, for the LOA will tend to that sorting process. Everyone and everything in the universe is consciousness. And all consciousness is vibration, or energy. And all consciousness has the abilit y to focus, even the one-celled ameba. All consciousness is having experience and all consciousness is having personal perception of that experience, and constant preferences are being born from that personal perception. Exposure to the contrast and variety of life causes continual personal preferences to emanate from every point of consciousness. When exposure to your experiences causes you to give birth to a personal preference, or desire, a vibration emanates from you, a rocket of desire, and your Inner-Being, your Source, All-That-Is, begins to immediately respond to that request. In other words, when you ask from any level of your being, it is given. Every time. Can you vibrationally match your new desires? So, the non-physical part of you receives your request as keen awareness of your rocket of desire, and turns its undivided attention toward the desire to which you‘ve just given birth. In other words, your Inner-Being instantly becomes a vibrational match to your new desire, and therefore it immediately receives the benefit of your leading-edge launching of your leading-edge desire. You, however, from your physical standpoint, are usually not yet a perfect vibrational match to you new desire, for your desire was born from contrast. And so you still have a mix of vibrations within you relative to your desire. In the moment the new desire, or preference, has been launched, there‘s an immediate discrepancy in a vibration of your Inner-Being, or Source, who immediately aligned with your new desire, and your personal physical persperctive which still holds a mix of vibrations. Your work now is to activate within your vibration only those aspects that match your new desire. And that is where your emotional guidance system comes in, for your emotions are your indicators of vibrational alignment or discord. For example, you‘re having a conversation with someone who is very busy and does not really want to take the time to have a discussion with you. This person is abrupt with you, even rude. This experience causes a preference to emanate from you. And even if you can not or do not put words to it, the fact is that you prefer to be treated with more respect. And so, a newly divine preference now radiates from you, and your Inner-Being finds immediate alignment with the idea of your being treated with more respect. You, however, have not yet found that alignment. You are still recalling this person‘s attitude, rude words and actions. Your vibrations are a mixture of how you want to be treated and how you just were treated. You‘re not a match to your new desire, but your Inner-Being is. If you‘re sensitive to the way you feel, you can sense the discord between the vibration of your Inner-Being and your in this moment vibration. In fact, that‘s what your emotions always indicate. A good feeling emotion indicates vibrational alignment between the perspective of your Inner-Being and you. A bad feeling emotion indicates vibrational misalignment between your Inner-Being and you. Another example: in sorting through your mail you find several requests for payments of bills due. And as you add them up, you realize you do not have enough money to pay everything you now owe. In that moment a desire for more money"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"emanates from you. And you Inner-Being focuses surely and immediately upon the idea of more money and takes pleasure from the idea of this. You, however, continue to sift through you stack of bills, facing the reality of where you now stand. „I have more bills than I have money to pay them“, you complain. You have not found alignment with your new desire, and the negative emotion that you feel – worry, anger, frustration – indicates your misalignment with your Source. No desire, no matter what the subject, can manifest into your experience, as long as there‘s a vibrational difference between the desire and your practised vibration. You have to practise yourself into vibrational alignment with your desires before they‘ll be realized in your experience. That‘s the reason that we reffer to your emotions as your emotional guidance system., for they help you recognize the relationship between the vibration of your desire and the vibration of your offering. No other factors need be considered in the achievement of anything you want. What others think, what they have lived, what they are living, what you have lived in the past, even what you are living right now, non of that has any bearing whatsoever on your ability to achieve the object of your desires. Only the vibrational relativity between your desire and you is relevant."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Chapter 11. Vibrational relativity and energy balance The vibrational relationship between you and your Source is the basis of your emotional guidance system. Your guidance system, like all guidance, is based upon something in relationship to something else. Consider the GPS, navigational system in your vehicle. While it does have the facility to pinpoint your precise location, it is of no value to you in terms of guidance, until you enter a programme in your desired destination. But once the navigational system has that information, it can begin to calculate a propose route from where you currently are to where you want to go. In the same way, the relationship between your current and desired body weight is a basis of the emotional guidance you receive. The relationship between your current financial situation and the amount of cash you would like to have in your bank account is the basis of the emotional guidance that you receive. The relationship between where you are and where you want to be is the basis of your personal guidance system. Even without an electronic navigational system you understand the relativity between where you are and where you want to be. And without that information you could not perceive with any clarity upon your journey. You would just be moving from place to place. Vibrational relativity exists in every possible subject: those of greater importance, those of lesser importance, those that come up many times in every day, and those that you think about only occasionally. Helpful and precise guidance is readily available to you, regarding all things, for there is no subject in your life in which vibration relativity is missing. The best path to your intended destinations If you have ever utilized an electronic navigational system in your vehicle, you have surely had the experience of programming an intended destination, and then for some reason deviating from the route. Something along the way may have attracted your attention, so you made an unscheduled turn along your route. Immediately your navigational system begins signaling you that you‘re off your course. You can explain your reasons for departing from your route, but your navigational system will simply continue to tell you that you have deviated from your intended route. Because as far as your guidance system is concerned, you are off your path. Of course, you could reprogramme the system because of your new decision, and your guidance system would then regroup and make a new plan. But as long as you‘re holding a specific intention of where you want to go, but are moving in a different direction from that intention, warning bells will ring. Now, you may say, „but Abraham, surely there is more than one path that will lead to my desired destination“. And we agree with you. There are many paths. Many satisfying paths. Paths that are satisfying for different reasons, which will lead to your desired destination. In fact, the joy of life is really in the journey. However, your vehicle‘s navigational system is considering the information within its unique system. It is determined where you are and contained within its information system of many possible routes, or paths. So, considering all those factors, your navigational system gives you the best route that it can conclude. In other words, it can not make decisions or give guidance outside of the information, contained in its system. You have a personal emotional guidance system Your personal emotional guidance system operates in a similar way to an electronic guidance system. You can not receive guidance outside of the routes, or beliefs, contained within your system. Your emotional guidance system relativity is based only upon your active vibrations,"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"beliefs and their relationship with your desired destination. Remember, a belief is realy only a thought that you keep thinking. Your emotions are your indicators of the vibrational relationship of the active vibrations within you. You‘ve come forth into this physical body as an extension of Source energy. And the vibration of your Source is always an active vibration within you. As you explore the variety and contrast of your own life experience, natural preferences, relating to the way you‘d like things to be, are vibrationally emitted from you in the form of vibrational signals, similar to electronic signals. You are literally beaming these signals forward into your future experience. Whenever a preference or desire is born with you as a result of something that you are living, that vibrational signal shoots forth like a rocket of desire and begins amassing power and clarity in your vibrational future, in what we lovingly refer to as your vibrational escrow. It‘s held there expressly for you. No-one else can swoop in and take it, depriving you of your own creation. It remains there pulsing, gaining power, momentum and clarification as you continue to amend your desires through processing more contrasting experiences. The contrast, in which you are focused, provides a wonderful basis for the launching of your unique desires. For whenever you‘re experiencing something that you do not want, you always understand more clearly what it is that you do want. Your Source immediately joins your every desire As you‘re focused here in this time-space reality, viewing life from your unique perspective, you unseizingly emit new signals for the improvement of your own life experience. In the moment your rockets of desire emanate from you, Source Energy becomes one with those desires. In fact, that is precisely the reason that we continue to unequivocally state to you that when you ask it is always given. For Source Energy acknowledges your desire, agrees with your desire, knows your desire and flows with your desire. The power of your Source immediately becomes one with your desire. And now the vibrational relativity between your newly launched desire, which has been joined by the Energy of Source, and your current habitual thoughts, or beliefs, upon the same subject, become appearant. You can literally feel the agreement or lack thereof, between the frequences of these energies. If you collected your bills from your mailbox and realized you did not have enough money to pay all of them, a desire for more money would shoot out of you into your vibrational future. And in the moment of that launching Source Energy will flow with your rocket of desire. But if you continue to agonize over the lack of money in your bank acount to pay those bills, your vibration will be very different from that of your desire, and so the emotion of worry and fear would be your indication of your vibrational discord. If someone you love has treated you badly, a rocket of desire to be treated with more respect would shoot from you, and your Source would agree with and respond to your request. Your Source literally forms a vibrational bond with your request, or desire, and your request is immediately granted. Source flows with your desire and sees it as you have requested that it be. But if you continue to remember or focus upon the hurtful experience, you hold yourself vibrationally apart from your own request. There is vibrational discord between the vibration of your desire and the vibration of what you‘re offering, as you focus upon your mistreatment. If the vibration of what is is the dominant vibration within you, regarding the subject of your relationship, then your relationship can not improve. And the emotional pain that you feel is your indication, that the vibrational relativity between where you are right now and what you desire must be improved. You must find a way of offering a vibration that matches that of your desire and of your Source, if you are to allow yourself to receive the benefit of your own request."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Chapter 12. Finding alignment with your Source Energy As you are focused here within your physical body, you‘re an extension of non-physical Source Energy. The eternal you is focused here in this physical body. The clear-minded joyous being, that is the total of all that you are, flows to you and through you in this body. But your Inner-Being, or Source, does not think for you. You‘re not a puppet, doing the bidding of that broader self. You are a fully conscious creator, expressing your unique desires here in this physical time-space reality. You are free to choose the direction of your own thoughts. So, your emotional guidance system exists to help you determine moment by moment the relationship between the vibration of what you‘re giving your attention to right now and the perspective of your Inner-Being. As you‘ve been focused here in your physical body, interacting with others and living the details of your own life experience, you‘ve encountered much contrast and variety, that has caused many rockets of desire to be launched. You could say that these desires are waiting somewhere in your future experience to be realized by you. We like to say that they‘re being held and tended to for you by Source Energy in a sort of vibrational escrow. They are your creation, they belong to you, and they‘re simply awaiting your vibrational alignment with them. And now you must feel your way to that alignment. Your emotional guidance system, the way you feel, is your constant indicator of the vibrational alignment between your active, or dominant, vibrations, beliefs, and the desires that you‘ve launched, that are waiting to be realized, or manifested, into your life experience. As you focus upon the subject of your desire, you can feel your harmony, or discord. The better you feel, the more in alignment you are with your desire. The worse you feel, the more out of alignment you are with your desire. Increased attention enhances the emotional intensity As the subject of your desire‘s activated within you by your attention to it, you can feel where you are on the sliding scale of vibrations. You can sense whether you‘re leaning toward the abundance of your desire, or the lack of abundance of your desire. Your emotions indicate your current beliefs in relationship with your current desire. If your life experience has caused you to launch many rockets of desire, relative to a subject, then Source Energy is flowing in a stronger way toward that particular desire. If that is the case, then the emotions that you feel will be stronger, regarding that subject. The more attention you give, the more the LOA responds, the faster the energy moves. And you can recognize the feeling of energy moving faster via those emotions that you describe as enthusiasm, passion, exuberance or joy. But what‘s happening to you, when you‘re feeling the stronger negative emotion of anger, or hatred, or fear? Those strong emotions certainly indicate also that energy is moving quickly. In other words, your contrasting experience has caused you to launch powerful rockets of desire, and Source Energy is now flowing toward those desires. But the negative emotions that you‘re feeling are because of the vibrational relativity between your active desire, which has the full attention of your Source, and your active in the moment vibration, where your attention is right now. Is your focus predominantly on what you want? So, your emotional guidance system is giving you feedback, based on two significant factors: 1. the power of your desire,or the vibrational speed of your desire, caused by the amount of contrasting experiences and the number of rockets of desires that have been launched about them; 2. the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"direction of your focus right now. In other words, your emotional guidance system is giving you powerful and accurate guidance, regarding the vibrational relationship between where you are right now and where you want to be. If your life experience has caused you to come to the point where you really want something, and in any given moment you‘re focused upon the opposite of that desire, you will feel strong negative emotion. But if your desire is strong, and your current thoughts are in vibrational alignment with that desire, then you will feel strong positive emotion. Your emotions are accurate indicators of the vibrational relativity between where you want to be and where you are right now. And your emotional guidance system is always accurate and available to you at all times. It is a very good system indeed."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Chapter 13.

And as you practise feeling better and continue to reach for better feeling thoughts, you‘ll train your vibration and your point of attraction to a place where only good things will come to you. Some of your beliefs are benefit to you and some of them are not. Your awareness of the vibrational relativity between your active desire and your active beliefs will help you sort that out.

Realigning with your vibration of Well-Being As you‘ve read through the previous examples of desires and beliefs, if you‘re like most people, reading this has caused an activation of many vibrations within you. You‘ve probably felt your own personal agreement, or disagreement, with some of what you‘ve just read. For it‘s easy to loose sight of your true objective when you‘re listening through a list of subjects that may touch upon some of the specifics of your own life. But we want you to remember the important premise that we are putting forth here – it is necessary for the vibration of your desire and the vibration of your belief to match. For without that vibrational alignment you are not in alignment. And as long as you‘re out of alignment, you cannot allow the Well-Being that you‘ve been asking for to flow into your experience. As you read the previous examples - and at the end of this chapter we encourage you to go back and read them again – you may have recognized that you agreed with the desires, or some of them, that we offered as examples, and that you also agreed with many of the first examples we offered of a belief that was incompatible with a stated desire. In other words, it‘s very common for a person to desire more money and believe there‘s simply not enough money. It‘s very common for a person to desire to lose unwanted body weight, and believe that no diets work for them. It‘s very common for a person to desire a healthy body and to believe that there‘s no cure for this physical condition. Balancing vibrations between your desires and beliefs The purpose of the examples we‘ve offered has been to help you understand that it‘s your work to bring vibrational balance between your desires and your beliefs. If your body is in this moment healthy, or if right now you have all the money you can possibly spend, you can look at your current state of affairs and speak about them as they are without causing a vibrational mismatch between your desires and your beliefs. But if on any subject things are not the way you want them to be, you cannot continue to speak about them as they are, without causing vibrational discord between your desire and your belief. And that vibrational discord will prevent you from realizing yuor desire. And remember, you emotions will IN THE MOMENT indicate that vibrational imbalance. This is your ultimate balancing of energy As you read again the examples of beliefs and desires that we‘ve offered here, try to be aware of your feeling of discord between the stated desire and the first example of belief that we‘ve offered. And then notice if you feel relief as you read the second example of belief. And then even more relief as you read the third example. To begin experiencing wonderful improvement in your own life experience on any subject that‘s important to you, you have only to understand, and then deliberately improve upon, the vibrational relationship between your desire and your belief. This is the ultimate balancing of energy. It‘s easy to get lost in the discussion of right or wrong, or whether something‘s true or not. Many will argue, „but this is what‘s happening, and I cannot deny that this is what‘s happening“. They‘ll argue that there are many others who agree with them about this injustice or that inappropriate situation. But we want you to realize that your attention to those things, which activate within you oposing vibrations to your own desires, will prevent you from ever finding the improvement you‘re seeking. You cannot continue to encourage a vibrational activation within yourself that oposes your own intentions, and ever hope to realize those intentions. You must first bring the vibration of your being into alignment."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Chapter 21. Finding vibrational alignment wtih your Inner-Being It‘s of great value to have continual awareness of the vibrational relativity between your current point of focus and the point of focus of your Inner-Being. If you remember that the attention of your Inner-Being is upon the outcome that you desire, and then if you will try to find vibrational alignment with your Inner-Being, you will then find vibrational alignment with your desired outcome. There‘re many valuable and good-feeling reasons to try to align with your Inner-Being, or Source, or who yuo really are. For instance, that non-physical part of you is the sum of all that you‘ve become and is, therefore, extremely wise. That non-physical part of you is Source Energy and is therefore the vibrational equivalent to love and Well-Being. That vibration of your Inner- Being is pure positive energy, resistance-free by your standards, and is therefore extremely powerful and effective. So, when you make the effort to come into closer vibrational alignment with that non-physical part of yourself, you open yourself to that wisdom, love, Well-Being and power. When you are in alignment with your Source, you experience the clarity, vitality, enthusiasm, passion and Well-Being, that is natural to you. Am I allowing or resisting my Well-Being? We reffer to your vibrational alignment with your Source as allowing. We reffer to your vibrational misalignment with your Source as less allowing. The more out of alignment you become, and the less you allow your connection to your Source, the more you become in a state of vibrational resistance. Resistance to thriving, resistance to wellness, resistance to clarity, resistance to abundance and resistance to your personal Well-Being. Sensitivity to your emotions will help you to be aware of just how much allowing or resisting you‘re doing in any moment in time. The better you feel, the more you‘re allowing your connection to your Source. The worse you feel, the less you‘re allowing your connection to your Source. Your most important decision to make When you decide to make your awareness of the vibrational relativity between you and your Source of extreme importance, you‘ve made the most important decision that you could ever make. For you have now consciously activated your own personal guidance system. And you will never be lost again. When you understand your emotions and what they mean, and so are able to deliberately improve the way you feel through a delibetare choosing of increasingly better felling thoughts, there will be no intent that you can not easily accomplish. All things that you desire will flow quickly and easily into your experience. Now, as new intentions continue to be born within you, your belief in your ability to accomplish them will grow as well. You‘ll begin to feel free, invincible, eager and joyful. You‘ll feel as your Inner-Being feels, enjoying the contrast that produces the desire that summons the energy that creates worlds, riding the wave of this fast moving current out here on this leading-edge of creation. In simple terms, the vibrational relationship between you and your Inner- Being translates into the difference between emotions that feel good and emotions that feel bad. Emotions that feel good indicate alignment with, or allowing of, your Source. While emotions that feel bad indicate misalignment with, or resistance to, the energy of your Source."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Freedom, or lack of such, is perceptual When you consider the extent of emotions that range from good feeling ones, such as joy, love and appreciation, all the way down to a depression, dispair, fear and grief, can you feel how empowering those good-feeling emotions are, and how disempowering those bad-feeling emotions are? Can you not sense the feeling of freedom on one end of the scale and the lack of freedom on the other? The good feeling end of the emotional guiding scale matches a vibration of perceived freedom. The bad feeling end of the emotional guiding scale matches a vibration of perceived lack of freedom. Freedom or lack of freedom is trully perceptual, because, whether you understand it or not, you are absolutely free. For no-one can get inside of you and offer your vibration for you. For it is only your own vibrational offering that affects your personal life experience. And so, it‘s of tremendous value for you to acknowledge, from your own point of view, the feeling of absolute freedom, or empowerment, that some emotions signal, and the feelings of utter bondage, or disempowerment, that are pointed out by others. Your Inner-Being, or Source, understands that you are free under all conditions to create what you desire. But when you perceive that you are not free, those negative emotions at ensue of depression, dispair, or fear, point out your misalignment. Your Inner-Being, or Source, understands that you are free under all conditions to create what you desire, so when you perceive that you are free, you feel those conforming, matching aligning feelings of positive emotion that indicate your alignment with Source. Now, when you conclude that nothing is more important than that you feel good, you‘ve come to the most important realization of all. For you‘ve now decided to deliberately manage the vibrational relationship between you and your Source. You‘ve decided to use the guidance system that you were born with to monitor and control the vibrational realtivity between your current focus and subsequent vibration and that of your Inner-Being. You‘ve decided to tend to your connection with your Source. You‘ve decided to thrive rather than pinch off your connection. You have chosen clarity, vitality, eagerness, abundance of all things you consider to be good and joy."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Chapter 22. The point of attraction and the relief factor We are going to offer a very wise but also very obvious statement here: you are where you are. What you have been thinking and what you curently are thinking has resulted in your creation, in your life experience of what is. And so, that‘s that. However, we want you to turn your full attention to the vibrational relativity between where you are right now and where you wanna be. For that is where all of your power is. That is where the thrill of creative genius lies. That vibrational variance between where you are and where you wanna be is the creative arena that you‘ve come forth to play within - the leading-edge of creation. This is what you‘ve come forth to experience and enjoy and to never complete. So, where you stand and how you feel right now equals your vibrational point of attraction. And if you are aware, you can tell by the way you feel how your perception of where you are right now matches, or does not match, the vibration of your Source. If right now you intent upon achieving the best match that you can with the vibration of your Source, then you‘ll be reaching for, or feeling for, better and better feeling thoughts. And as you find a better feeling thought, a feeling of relief will be your experience. The emotional guidance scale: from allowing to resistance Imagine an emotional guidance scale with the good feeling thoughts on one end, and the bad feeling thoughts on the other. And now acknowledge that the end that feels good equals allowing, and the end that feels bad equals resistance. So it is obvious that depending upon your choice of thoughts you cuold move toward either end of the scale. It‘s also obvious that the furhter you are from one end of the scale, the closer you are to the other end. In other words, this thought feels better, this thought feels worse. This better feeling thought indicates allowing, this worse feeling thought indicates resistance. Now, a scale of your emotions would look something like this: 1. jo y, knowledge, empowerment, freedo m, love, appreciat ion; 2. passion; 3. enthusiasm; eagerness, happiness; 4. positive expectation, belief; 5. optimism; 6. hopefulness; 7. contentment; 8. boredom; 9. pessimism; 10. frustration, irritation, impatience; 11. overwhelment; 12. disappointment; 13. doubt; 14. worry; 15. blame; 16. discouragement; 17. anger; 18. revenge; 19. hatred, rage; 20. jealousy; 21. insecurity, guilt, unworthiness; 22. fear, grief, depression, dispair, powerlessness."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Since the same words are often used to mean different things, and different words are often used to mean the same things, these word labels for your emotions are not absolutely accurate for every person who feels the emotion. In fact, giving word labels to the emotions could cause confusion and distract you from the real purpose – of your emotional guidance scale. The thing that matters most is that you consciously reach for a feeling that‘s improved. The word for the feeling is not important. Continually reach for relief from resistance A rather effective way of balancing your energy is to continually reach for a feeling of relief. A feeling of relief always indicates an improvement in your vibration, and it always means a releasing of resistance, or an increasing of allowing. And if we were standing in your physical shoes, we would make the relief factor the most important part of our personal awareness. When you continually look for a way of looking at everything that feels slightly better than what you‘re currently feeling, you‘re getting closer and closer to seeing your world as your Inner-Being sees it. And in the process you will be leaving resistance behind. Your own resistance is the only factor that keeps you from realizing all the wonderful things that you desire. Illness is about resistance, confusion is abuot resistance, poverty is about resistance, sadness is about resistance. Even car accidents are about resistance. All things that you consider to be bad exist only because of resistance to your natural Well-Being. There is not a source of unwanted You do not walk into a room and look for the dark switch. For you understand there is not a switch that floods darkness into the room, which covers the source of light. And by the same principle there‘s not a source of sickness, badness or evil. But merely a practised resistance to the natural source of Well-Being. Reaching for relief moment by moment, thought by thought, and subject by subject will bring you increasingly closer to your Source of Well-Being. When you care about how you feel, and you deliberately try to look at things in ways that feel better and better to you, making the best of things instead of the worst of things, you will allow more and resist less. And the circumstances and events of your life will begin to reflect those changes immediately. Relief indicates the releasing of resistance, which is the same thing as moving toward more allowing. It is an effective use of your emotional guidance system."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Chapter 23. The balancing of energies for joyful creation The variety, or contrast, that surrounds you is of tremendous value. For it‘s the data from which your personal preferences and desires are born. You are creator. And you create through the power of your focus. In every moment that you live and with every experience you live the variety of your life inspires the launching of new desires and the amending of previous desires. And so, focused desire never ceases to flow forth from you. The expansion of the universe is dependant upon this process: contrast causes a focusing of desire and then through the LOA that desire is answered by Source Energy. In other words, when you ask, it is always given. Many argue that they‘ve been asking but they‘re not getting what they‘ve been asking for. And we explain that anytime anyone from any perspective asks for anything, it is always given. But the asking that we‘re refering to is not the formulating of words or sentences, but the emanation of vibrations that exude naturally fro m you as you explore the contrast. For you cannot cease asking. Asking is the most natural and the most important result of the contrasting environment in wich you‘re focused. The reason, the only reason, that people ever find themselves in a position where they‘ve been asking for something that they‘re not receiving, is because they are holding themselves vibrationally apart from their own desire. The vibrational frequences of what they want and what is dominantly active within them must balance. Examples of balancing contrasting vibrational frequences The following examples will illustrate how you can benefit from the natural contrast of your physical environment by utilizing your emotional guidance system and deliberately improving a vibrational relationship between your desires and beliefs. These examples will demonstrate the process of the deliberate balancing of energies for the purpose of joyful creation. First, we will describe a common situation of what is. Notice the beliefs that are active within the current situation. And we will call that the Current contrasting situation . Next, we will list the desires that are born out of that contrast. For whenever you‘re in a situation where you know what you do not want, in that moment of contrast you always know more clearly what it is that you do want. And we will call that Resulting desires . Next, we will list the emotions that indicate the current active vibrations, or beliefs. And we‘ll head that up as Resulting emotions , or indications of vibrational discord . And now we‘ll offer series of statements to assist in bringing the current active vibration into alignment with the desire. As you read, see if you can feel the improvement in the vibrational relativity between the desires and the beliefs. Know that the feeling of relief indicates both, the releasing of resistance and the improvement in the vibrational relationship between the desire and the belief. In other words, the better you feel, the more in balance your energies are. Of course you could also say, the more in balance my energies are, the better I feel. And we‘ll call this segment Deliberate effort to improve the vibrational relationship between my new desire and my current belief . And finally, we‘ll point out the specific improvement in the vibrational relationship between the desire and the belief, as it‘s evidenced by the better feeling emotion. We‘ll head up that segment with the term Result . There‘s no understanding that will ever be of more importance to you than this. For once you understand the process of deliberately bringing the vibration of your beliefs into alignment with the vibrations of your intentions, you will be the deliberate creator of your experience, and there will be no intentions that you cannot fulfil. Remember, if the life you‘re living has the resources to produce within you any specific desire, then the resources exist for your full receiving, or manifestation, of that desire."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Chapter 24.

The value of improved vibrational relativity Often when considering the idea of being the creator of their own reality, people will argue that it‘s extremely difficult to be standing in the middle of a very much unwanted condition and at the same time offer more pleasant thoughts about their future experience. They argue that it would be so much easier to creat a bright and beautiful future from a more pleasant now experience. We understand their thinking. And we do agree that it is easier to feel good under positive conditions than negative ones. Therefore we understand people‘s wishes that things could have gone better for them before now so that now could be a happier launching pad for that which is still to come. Some people feel deep resentment over the unpleasant facts of their earlier life experiences as they recount unpleasant details of unfairness or even physical abuse that took place during their childhood. They often feel defensive. And we do not argue with their right to feel that way. We often agree that under the conditions that they‘ve lived their negative response is justified. But we also always add that even though they are justified in their negative response to what happened to them, still that negative emotion indicates that they are holding themselves in a place where they cannot receive what they really desire. Those words, however, usually only serve to annoy them further. For they feel the way they feel, and they‘ve been practising this position for so long, that our words, even though very wise ones, do not dissuade them from their practised belief about the injustices they‘ve experienced. Have you been creating deliberately, or by default? Many of our physical friends feel a deep memory stirring when we explain to them that they are the creator of their reality. They do want to creat their own reality, and many in time resonate with the idea that they are vibrationally based beings living in a vibrationally based universe. And often they even acccept the idea that they were born with an emotional guidance system within them that helps them know the content of their own personal vibrational offering, which helps them to know at all times if what they are in the process of creating will be pleasing to them when it arrives. But most people, even those who consciously acknowledge their vibrational nature and emotional guidance system, still offer most of their vibrations, and therefore creat most of their reality, by default. They do so because they offer most of their vibrations in response to the reality that they‘re observing rather than in response to the reality that they prefer. There‘s something so compelling about what has already materialized in your experience. You call it reality. You call it fact. You call it evidence. You call it proof. You document it in writing and with pictures. You call it history. And in doing all of that you overlook the absolutely temporary nature of it, whatever it is. From our point of view, you have allowed your reality to hold a more dominant place in your perception of life than it deserves. And by your ardent attention to your current reality you slow your progress to the reception of even more pleasing now experiences. We would like you to understand that now is mostly only the platform from which you move into what is next. And life is really about the moving into what‘s next. We want to recall the delicious nature of focusing upon the sensation of creating your own reality rather than giving so much attention to the reality that you‘re creating. Can you feel the distinction?"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"You‘re travelling on two concurrent journeys We visited recently with the women who was experiencing the severe discomfort of arthritic hips. Her current state of reality was one of nearly constant physical discomfort. If we could just help her to understand that her painful physical condition is only the temporary place that she is currently standing, then she could begin to move to a better feeling condition immediately. If we could just get her to focus upon where she‘s moving to instead of focusing upon the reality that‘s right now occuring, if we could just get her to focus upon the sensation of moving to a better feeling place rather than focusing upon the reality that seems to have concluded, her situation would begin to improve immediately. We wanted to help her see that there are two journeys running along concurrently in her experience: the action journey, or the reality of her painful arthritic hips, and the emotional journey, the emotion that she‘s choosing to feel as she moves through her day. From her current reality, or the platform from which she‘s now launching into her next experiences, she now has these choices: she has painful arthritic hips and feels fear, anger, worry, blame or dispair; she has painful arthritic hips and feels hope. You see, her current condition, her painful hips, is her action journey. That is happening, it is reality, that is her current condition. And we certainly can understand why it would have her attention. But if she could just for a little while try to focus upon her emotional journey, if she could just accept that her hips hurt for now, and set that action journey aside in her mind for just a little while, and focus upon her emotional journey options, then her vibrational point of attraction would begin to change. And in doing that her physical condition would begin to change. You cannot continue to offer the same vibration that got you to where you are, and now get to some place different.

The action journey and the emotional journey Focus on the idea of moving your physical body from one place to another. Maybe you‘re in your vehicle on the highway driving to another city, or walking down the trail in the woods with a backpack filled with food and supplies. In each example you probably have a clear idea of your destination. You‘re purposely moving from one place to another with an intention of arriving somewhere. We‘ll call this your action journey . Your actual journey of action. This actual journey can be described in very factual terms. You can identify the distance you plan to travel, you can describe the weather that‘s occuring, you can estimate with the fair accuracy your estimated time of arrival. There are many straightforward, easy to understand, quantifiable aspects to this action journey that you‘ve embarked upon. Now we want to call your attention to another part of your journey. And it‘s this perspective of your journey that actually sets the tone for everything that will subsequently happen in your life experience. For your journeys are not only the cut-and-dried factual experiences of moving from one place to another. They are much more about the way you feel as you travel. We call this aspect of your experiences your emotional journey . So we want you to understand that you are never only upon one of these journeys. In every moment you‘re experiencing two concurrent journeys: your action journey, your awareness of time and space and things already manifested, and your emotional journey, your vibrational response to your powerful moment in time, from which all future experiences are molded. There are endless potential combinations of action journeys and emotional journeys. And we will offer some examples of those here. We want you to come to know that the most important aspect of any journey is the emotional aspect. For if you are aware of how you feel, and are able to affect those feelings deliberately, then, and only then, will you have conscious control of all future outcomes of your life experience. We call this deliberate creation. On the other hand, if your dominant focus is upon the action journey, observing and responding to the things that are happening right now in your experience, allowing your feelings to naturally follow the patterns of your observations, and making no effort to guide your feelings, but merely responding to conditions and circumstances, then you‘ll have no conscious cotrol of your own life experience.

Applying the Book of Positive Aspects Process Whatever you‘re focused on is causing an activation of a vibration within you. And the better you feel while you‘re focused the more beneficial your focus is. Whenever you deliberately look for the positive aspects of something, you‘re deliberately activating beneficial vibrations. Now, it‘s not important that you find the perfect vibration, or the best vibration. But deliberately looking for the positive aspects of a subject will automaticly get you pointed in the right direction. Sometimes if something‘s been bothering you, it‘s not easy to write a long list, or even a short one, of its positive aspects. But whenever you‘re determined to find a positive aspect, you can usually find one. And once you find one and activate it within you, you can then find another, and another, until within a short 15 or 20 minutes of focusing upon a subject, you can significantly change your vibration on the subject. The process is simple. Obtain a notebook that‘s comfortable to use and write on the cover „My book of positive aspects“. Open the first page and write „Positive aspects of..“ and then write the subject for which you want improvement in your vibrational relationship. Then write your list of positive aspects on that subject. Do not try to force these ideas, but let them flow easily through you onto your paper. Write as long as the thoughts flow, and then read what you have written, and enjoy your own words. It could be helpful to focus on the situation, and then ask yourself, „What do I like about you? What are your good points?“ The process works best if your range on the emotional scale is somewhere between (1) Joy/ Knowledge/Empowerment/Freedom/Love/Appreciation and (10) Frustration/Irritation/Impat ience. If you‘re feeling much worse than this, then other processes may be more effective to help you improve your vibrational relativity. But we‘ve noticed that anyone with deliberate intent regarding any subject can improve the way they feel. And when they do, things must begin to improve in their experience. The LOA insists that it must. Here are some examples of how the positive aspects process could help you release resistance and improve the vibrational relativity between what‘s happening right now and what you would like to be happening. Home deterioration situation Current contrasting situation: I‘ve lived in the same place for a long time and I‘m tired of it. It doesn‘t meet our needs at all anymore. But we can‘t really afford to move. I even find myself looking for excuses to not be at home because I don‘t feel good when I‘m there. Resulting emotions, or indications of vibrational discord: I feel frustration. I feel irritation. I feel pessimism. Positive aspects: My things have been in the same place for long enough that I know where they are. There is stability in being in a familiar place. We fix this place up as much as we intend to, so we can now spend our free time doing other things we like. Our friends and professional contacts are not likely to lose touch with us here. We have a good relationship with our mail carrier. Another service people have known us for a long time. It‘s been fun watching our landscape yard mature. Some of these trees in shreds are like old friends."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Co-worker situation Current contrasting situation: I share an office with someone who I can hardly stand to be around. She does not have a nice thing to say about much of anything. And she wants to talk all the time. She doesn‘t enjoy her job, and she treats me like I‘m foolish when I wanna do mine. I wish she‘d either quit or get fired. Life is too short to have to spend so much time with someone so unpleasant. Resulting emotions, or indications of vibrational discord: I feel irritation. I feel blame. I feel anger. Positive aspects: I‘m pleased that I have employment. I am happy that I have a regular paycheck. I like the financial stability that my work provides. I enjoy meeting the people who work there. My job requires focus. And I like the feeling of being productive. My office mate keeps a neat desk. She always dresses neatly. She has a great laugh. She has a good background for our field. She learns quickly. Government situation Current contrasting situation: I‘m very tired of the inefficiency of governmental bureaucracy. There are so many government requarements that you have to hire people you shouldn‘t even need just to fill out the bureaucratic forms. You can‘t even get the bureaucracy on the phone to personaly answer a question. I‘ve wasted so much of my time just trying to find out what I‘m supposed to do, so that I can do it the way they want it done the first time. We need a better bureaucratic system. Resulting emotions, or indications of vibrational discord: I feel frustration. I feel overwhelmed. I feel blame. Positive aspects: I am glad that the government tends to some of the things that I don‘t wanna deal with. Our government employes many people, which adds beneficially to the economy. Our government in our laws provide a stable platform for us. Well, there are some talented progressive thinkers in our government. Those who comprise our government come and go. As you read these examples, or even as you address issues in your own life experience, it‘s easy to get lost in an idealogical debate over the correctness, rightness, actual truth or facts of the issue. But there are many things that are true, things that someone somewhere has created that you do not want to create in your experience. And there are things from your own past that, even though they were true, you do not want to continue to repeat in your future. When you care enough about something to actually take the time to make it an entry in your book of positive aspects, it is certain that with far less effort and energy than you would spend debating the truth or facts of an issue with someone, you can improve the relationship between the vibration of your desire and the vibration of your belief. This positive aspects process will give you an immediate vibrational improvement. Enjoy your improved feeling. Compliment yourself for improving your vibrational relativity. Move on with your day. And the continued evidence of your accomplishment will in time reveal itself to you."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Chapter 34. Applying the Segment Intending Process The process of segment intending is one whereby you define the vibrational characteristics of the time segments you‘re moving into. It‘s a way of prepaving your vibrational path, so to speak, for easier and more enjoyable travel. It‘ll help you focus less on how things are feeling right now and more upon how you want them to feel. It‘s a powerful process that emphasizes the emotional journey while deemphasizing the action journey. This process will help you be more deliberate about focusing your thoughts. It will help you become more aware of where your thoughts currently are, and it will help you to more deliberately choose the thoughts that you offer. In time it will feel very natural to you to stop for a moment upon entering a new segment and deliberately direct your own intent or expectation. You enter a new segment any time your intentions change. If you‘re washing dishes and the telephone rings, you enter a new segment. When you get into your vehicle, you enter a new segment. When another person walks in to the room, you enter a new segment. If you will take the time to get your thought of your expectation for the segment started, even before you‘re inside your new segment, then you‘ll be able to set the tone of the segment more specifically than if you walk into the segment and begin to observe it as it already is. In other words, segment intending is focusing upon your emotional journey, not the action journey. Whenever you‘re setting forth your intentions about how you want to feel and how you would like a segment to unfold, it is always beneficial. Now, this segment intending process works best if your range on the emotional scale is somewhere between (4) Positive Expectation/Belief and (11) Overwhelment. Fatigue situation Current contrasting situation: I have no energy. I feel tired all of the time. I can barely get through the day. I‘m having a hard time keeping up with the things I need to do. And I am not enjoying anything because I‘m so tired. Resulting emotions, or indications of vibrational discord: I feel overwhelmed. Applying the Segment Intending Process : I finished my day at work. I stopped to the grocery store and bought several bags of food and household items. I‘ve now parked in my driveway, and I‘ve turned off my vehicle. But before getting out of the car to begin unloading my groceries, I‘ve decided to apply this process of segment intending. Now, this new segment involves moving the groceries from the car to the house and putting them where they belong. My intentions for this new segment : during this segment I want to feel efficient, I want to feel productive, I want to feel organized, I want to feel good in my body, I want to feel appreciation for the groceries, and I want to feel appreciation for my kitchen."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Job situation Current contrasting situation: I get paid pretty well, compared to a lot of other jobs around. But I don‘t look forward to going to work. I‘ve been doing pretty much the same thing for a long time. And I don‘t feel stimulated at all. No-one seems to notice what I do, unless I make a mistake. The day goes by so slowly, and then I have to turn around and do it all again the next day. Resulting emotions, or indications of vibrational discord: I feel boredom. I feel pessimism. Applying the Segment Intending Process : I‘ve showered and dressed, and have eaten breakfast. I‘ve now driven to work and have just parked my car in the parking space. Before going inside I‘ve decided to sit in my car for 2 or 3 minutes to apply this process of segment intending. Now this new segment involves a one hour staff meeting where my manager and everyone in her department will meet. We have this meeting every Monday morning. My intentions for this new segment : I want to be on time. I want it to be evident that my weekend has refreshed me. I want to feel clear minded and happy. I want to enjoy the others who are gathering. I want this meeting to feel productive. I want to feel happy that I attended this meeting, and I want others to be happy that I was there. You see, this segment intending process may feel too simple or too easy to be of value. But a deliberate application of this process will turn an unfocused life filled with unsatisfying experiences into a dynamic passionate life experience. This process improves the relationship between your current belief vibration and the vibration of your desire, because it causes you to stop focusing on what is, and to begin focusing on something that‘s coming. With some practice you can become very adept at increasing your positive expectation. When your negative emotion is as slight as the range we‘ve just indicated, it‘s not such a big vibrational leap for you to be more optimistic about your future experience. But if you‘re feeling stronger negative emotion than we‘ve indicated as a range for this process, you may have a difficult time anticipating a positive upcoming segment, and you could just carry the negative feeling you‘re having right now on to the next segment, too. If you find yourself doing that, discontinue the process, for it is of no value, for you will only focus on what you do not want even more specifically into your future segment. Be playful and hopeful as you begin this process, and in time you‘ll feel powerful and certain as you deliberately instruct universal forces and the interplaying factors to behave in exactly the way you‘ve intended. With practice this segment intending process will give you the sensation of being a masterful artist, or creator, who dictates all outcomes, who identifies all details, and who deliberately sculpts the details of your own life experience. For you are the creator of your own life exerience."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Chapter 35. Applying the „Wouldn‘t it be nice if..“ process Most people have been trained to be objective, meaning that they look at the pluses and minuses, the pros and the cons. But in considering both sides of things they also activate the contradictory vibrations which cause a hindering resistance to the allowing of what they desire. When you say „I want this thing to happen, but it hasn‘t happened yet“, you‘re not only activating the vibration of your desire, you‘re also activating a vibration of the absence of your desire. So nothing changes for you. And often even when you do not speak the second part of the sentence, and you only say, „I want this to happen“, there‘s an unspoken vibration within you that continues to hold you in a state of not allowing your desire. But when you say, „Wouldn‘t it be nice if this desire would come to me“, you achieve a different sort of expectation that is much less resistant in nature. The vibrational relativity between your desire and your belief is now much more in alignment. This „Wouldn‘t it be nice if..“ process works best if your range on the emotional guidance scale is between (4) Positive Expectation/Belief and (16) Discouragement.

As you move through your day, many different situations arise that cause the activation of a variety of vibrations within you. You feel good about some things, not so good about some other things, and some things you feel bad about. This „Wouldn‘t it be nice if..“ process can help you feel better almost every time if you are willing to focus in a better feeling direction. Saying words „Wouldn‘t it be nice if..“ queues you up for an improved vibration and inspires deliberate focus. Saying these words also begins a positive activation even before you say the rest of the words that are related to the topic. If you will deliberately play this game as you drive or while you‘re standing in line, or any time that your attention does not need to be on something else, the vibrational relativity between your desire and your beliefs on a myriad of subjects will improve. And desires that are being held out there for you in vibrational escrow will begin showing up in your experience. A consistant playing of this game will cause a gradual improvement in a vibrational relationship between where you are and where you want to be regarding every area of your life.

Applying the „Which thought feels better“ process This process works best if you can sit for a few minutes and write your thoughts down on paper. In time, when you‘ve played the game sufficiently, you‘ll find success with it just by rolling your thoughts across your mind. But writing them down on paper causes a much more powerful point of focus. Which makes it easier for you to feel the direction of your chosen thought. To begin, first write some brief statements of how you feel about this subject right now. You could describe what has happened, but what‘s most important is that you describe how you feel . This will help you more easily recognize any improvement as you move through the process. Once you‘ve wirtten a few statements that indicate how you really feel right now, make this statement to yourself: „I‘m going to reach for some thoughts about this subject that feel a little better“. Then write a series of brief thoughts that come to your mind that might help you feel better about this subject. At the conclusion of each statement evaluate whether it feels better, the same, or worse than when you initially began. By focusing with the intent of improving the way you feel about these subjects, you‘ll improve the vibrational relationship between your desires and your beliefs. And then, in time, these situations must improve. Your manifestations always follow the direction of your vibration. When you feel better, things improve. Every time. This „Which thought feels better“ process works best if your range on the emotional guidance scale is between (4) Positive Expectation/Belief and (17) Anger.

It takes no effort to just observe what is already before you, and there‘s no effort involved in considering any thought that just drifts into your mind. But it does require effort to deliberately choose what you‘re thinking about.

If you feel as if things are not changing, or changing very slowly, this is the reason – you‘re giving most of your attention to the what IS you‘re living , and very little of your attention to the what you would LIKE to be living . Because money is a big part of your day- to-day experience, a slight adjustment in the vibrational relationship between your desire and what you‘re usually activate around this subject, can make a very big difference in your experience. If it‘s your desire to have more money, but whenever you think about money, you feel worried or frustrated, your emotional guidance system is indicating that you‘re moving in the wrong direction. You have to improve the vibrational relationship between your desire and the thoughts you most often think about this subject before things can change. And, as with all things, an improvement in the way you feel means that you‘re heading in the direction of your desire. It‘s natural for abundance to flow easily into your experience, and the Wallet process will help you offer a vibration that‘s compatible with your receiving of money instead of your pushing it away. This Wallet process works best if your range on the emotional guidance scale is between (6) Hopefulness and (16) Discouragement. The Wallet process First, obtain a 100 dollar bill and put it in your wallet or purse. Keep it with you at all times. And whenever you hold your wallet, or your purse, remember that your 100 dollar bill is there. Feel pleased that it is there, and remind yourself often of the added sense of security that it brings you. Now, as you move through your day, take note of the many things that you could purchase with that 100 dollars. By holding the 100 dollar bill and not spending it right away you receive the vibrational advantage of it everytime you even think about it. In other words, if you were to remember your 100 dollars and spent it on the first thing you noticed, you would receive the benefit of really feeling your financial Well-Being only once. But if you mentally spend that 100 dollars twenty or thirty times in that day, you‘ll have received the vibrational feeling advantage of having spent 2000 or 3000 dollars. Each time you acknowledge that you have the power right there in your wallet to purchase this, or to do that, you add to your sense of financial Well-Being over and over again. And so, your point of attraction begins to shift: I could have that, I could have that, I have the ability to purchase that. And because you really do have the means to do just that (you‘re not pretending something that‘s not), there‘s now no hindering doubt or disbelief, muddying the waters of your financial flow. The Wallet process is a simple but powerful process, and it will change your financial point of attraction. Financial abundance situation Current contrasting situation: My husband and I have both had jobs for years. We saved some money. Not a lot, but enough to live on for a year. We had a really great idea for our own business, and we had a friend who had enough money to help us get started, but now, after two years, we‘re still taking money from our savings to live on. And our savings account is going down fast. Resulting emotions, or indications of vibrational discord: I feel worried. I feel discouraged."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Applying the Wallet process: We‘ve decided to take a drive. Each of us has in our possession 100 dollars. It‘s our plan in the next hour or so to drive to the commercial district near our home and mentally spend these very real dollars again and again. Whenever either of us sees something that we want, we‘re gonna experience the fun of mentally purchasing it. After all, we‘ve got the money right here right now, so we really could purchase an item if we wanted to. We‘re just gonna drive around, look out the window, see what catches our attention, and mentally buy it if it pleases us. Oh, let‘s have dinner there tonight. I love eating there. Let‘s stop at the flower stand and get a gigantic bouquet. I think I‘ll buy that outdoor cooker for out patio. Let‘s get that swing set for the grandkids. Let‘s place an order with the man‘s selling firewood so we‘re ready for our first fire. I‘m gonna schedule a day at the spa. Well, I‘m gonna get a great haircut. I think I‘ll stop and pick up some new shoes. Me too. I love that rug. What a good price that is. I‘d like 2 or 3 of those big garden flowerpots. I‘d like those outdoor tree lights. Let‘s get a new mail box. And mulch for the front flowerbeds. I‘m gonna have the car washed and detailed. I love that rocking-chair. Let‘s get it for the porch. How about new garden hoses? When you play this Wallet game the first time, it is possible that in identifying things that you want to purchase you may activate your feeling of not enough money. So, in the first minutes of the game you may feel an increase in your discomfort rather than an increased feeling of relief. But as you play the game, if with each item that you identify you‘ll stop and acknowledge, „yes, if I really wanted to, I do have the money right here right now to make this purchase“, your discomfort will soften. And as you play the game longer, that discomfort will go away altogether. And once the discomfort is gone, the resistance is gone. And when the resistance is gone, your financial situation must begin to improve."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Chapter 38. Applying the Focus wheel process The Focus wheel is perhaps the most powerful process we offer to assist you in quickly improving the vibrational relationship between your current beliefs and your current desires. As you experience this Focus wheel process you can actually feel the improvement taking place in the vibrational alignment of your energies. Imagine standing next to a playground Marry go around . And it‘s your intention to jump up onto it, but it‘s going so fast that when you try to get on, you can not. The difference in the momentum of the Marry go around and your own is too great. So you just get knocked off into the bushes. But if the Marry go around were to slow down, at some point you could jump right up onto it, and then, when it speeds up, you can easily stay on board. A similar thing happens when there‘s a vabriation in the momentum of your desire and the momentum of your belief. Either your desire has to slow down or your belief has to speed up in order for alignment to occur. By focusing on this process you can slow the vibrational momentum of your desire enough so that you can get on board. And then, once you‘re on, you can increase the speed of the vibration. This process works best if your range on the emotional guidance scale is between (8) Boredom and (17) Anger. The Focus wheel process Draw a large circle on the sheet of paper. Then draw a smaller circle, about 2 inches in diameter in the center of the large circle. Now sit back and look at the small circle and feel your eyes focus upon it. Then close your eyes for a moment and turn your attention to whatever has happened that produced the negative emotion within you. And identify exactly what it is that you do not want. Now say to yourself, „Well, I clearly know what I don‘t want. What is it that I do want?“ It is helpful if you try to indentify what you do not want, as well as what you do want, in terms of the way you wanna feel about it. Now write a brief statement of what you DO want in a small circle in the center of your page. Next try to write statements around the outside edge of your large circle that match what you do want. When you find a statement that‘s a close enough match, you‘ll know it. In other words, you‘ll feel whether your statement does not match and throws you off the wheel into the bushes, so to speak, or whether it‘s a statement that‘s close enough to your desire that it now sticks. The reason that Focus wheel process is so effective is because the statements you‘re writing are those that you have deliberately chosen. They‘re general statements that you already believe, which match your desire. The reason it works is because the LOA is so very powerful that when you hold a thought for as little as 17 seconds, another thought like it will join it. And once those two thoughts come together, there‘s a combustion that occurs that makes your thoughts even more powerful. As you find thoughts that feel good, continue writing them around the perimeter of your larger circle. Start at what 12 o‘clock would be if you were looking at a clock, and then continue around 1 o‘clock, 2 o‘clock and so on, until you have 12 statements that feel good to you. Now, after wirting along the 11 o‘clock position, emphatically circle the words that you originally wrote in the center of your Focus wheel. And notice that you do feel a closer vibrational alignment with that thought, when only minutes before you were nowhere near that vibration. Fatigue situation Current contrasting situation: I have no energy. I feel tired all of the time. I can barely get through the day. I‘m having a hard time keeping up with the things I need to do. And I am not enjoying anything because I‘m so tired. Resulting emotions, or indications of vibrational discord: I feel overwhelmed."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"My statement of what I DON‘T want : I don‘t want to feel tired.

(not on) I can‘t go on like this. (not on) I do remember feeling better than I feel right now. (on) That statement was close enough in vibrational relationship to your desire that it sticks. So write it on your Focus wheel at the 12 o‘clock position. And as you find other statements that stick, continue to write them around the clock, so to speak, at 1 o‘clock, 2 o‘clock and so on. I usually am hearty. (at 1 o‘clock) I do like feeling good. (2 o‘clock) Your focus has now caused enough improvement in the vibrational relationship between where you are and where you want to be that you can now easily stay on the wheel.

(10 o‘clock) There are so many things I enjoy doing. (11 o‘clock) This game has caused you to focus on the feeling of the vibrational variance between where you are and where you want to be. And in the short time your vibrational relativity has improved tremendously. So much, in fact, that you can now write a statement in the small circle in the center of your focus wheel from where you are vibrationally right now which matches your statement of desire. In other words: I feel strong, hearty and energized . Loneliness situation Current contrasting situation: I don‘t have many friends. Really, I don‘t even have one really close friend. It‘s not much fun going through life alone. I‘ve had friendships in the past, but nothing that really clicked.

Acting career situation Current contrasting situation: I‘v wanted to be an actress since I was a little girl. I took some classes and found out that I‘m pretty good at it. I get some acting work from time to time, but nothing exciting. And nothing that I really want. It‘s hard. There are so many people applying for the same work that I am, that it seems hopeless. Maybe I should just forget about it and go get a real job. Resulting emotions, or indications of vibrational discord: I feel disappointed. I feel discouraged.

So write the next statement in the small center circle: I will so enjoy these great parts coming my way . After focusing on something unwanted for a while, and therefore activating vibrations that are not a match to what you really want, it becomes increasingly difficult to then turn your attention to what you want. But you must find a way to focus your attention differently in order to be able to create something different. This Focus wheel process has been designed for that very reason: it helps you to jump in from right where you are and then spin yourself to higher and higher vibrations. This process will move you from great resistance faster than any other. The key to the power of this process is contained within its name: FOCUS. Whenever you are able to take the time to focus upon something and write it on paper, your focus and power increases. The process of drawing the large circle emphasizes your deliberate intent to focus, and then stating where you‘re currently are in the beginning amplifies the vibrational discord that is currently present. It requires more focus still just to get on the wheel the first time. That is the moment of the biggest vibrational shift. But once your first statement has been written at the 12 o‘clock position, less focus is required to stay there. And as you add another statement, and another, and another, your vibration stabilizes, and the vibrational relationship between your desire and your belief improves. We would use this process on every subject that matters to us. We would use it to improve situations, to improve relationships, to attract more money, and to achieve improved bodily conditions. This is the process worth learning and applying. The Focus wheel process can transform your life."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Chapter 39. Applying the Finding The Feeling Place Process The Finding The Feeling Place Process is most helpful in making sure that you‘re radiating a vibration that will serve you. In that this is a process that will help you realize what you‘re actually attracting. This process is one of using your imagination to pretend that your desire has already come about, and that you‘re actually living the details of that desire. As you focus upon what it feels like to be living your desire, you cannot at the same time be feeling the absence of your desire. So, with practice you can tip the scale, so to speak, so that even though your desire has not actually yet manifested, you‘re offering a vibration as if it has. And then it must. Your goal in this process is to conjure up images that cause you to offer a vibration that allows your desire. Your goal is to create images that feel good to you. Your goal is to find a feeling place of what it would be like to have your desire rather than finding the feeling place of what it‘s like to not have it. You could use a remembering technique, and remember a time more like that which you now desire. You could use an imagining technique, and imagine or pretend that it‘s happening now. Or you could focus upon someone who is already living your desire. And as you focus upon details of the desire that you hold, its vibrational essence within you will be activated. You do not have to be actually living something in order to offer the vibration of it. But once you do offer the vibration of it, it will not be long before you are living it. The more often you play this Finding the Feeling Place Process, the better you will be at playing it, and the more fun it will become. When you pretend, or selectively remember, you activate new vibrations, and your point of attraction shifts. And when your point of attraction shifts, your life will improve regarding every subject for which you found a new feeling place. This Finding The Feeling Place Process works best if your range on the emotional guidance scale is somewhere between (10) Frustration/Irritation/Impatience and (17) Anger. Marital situation Current contrasting situation: I still love my wife, but our relatioship is nothing like it used to be. When we were first married, I couldn‘t wait to see her at the end of the day, and now, to be honest, I sort of dread going home. She complains a lot about so many different things, and I think she blames me for everything that isn‘t going the way she wants it to. I don‘t wanna leave, but it‘s sure not fun staying, either. Resulting emotions, or indications of vibrational discord: I feel frustration. I feel blame. I feel irritation. Remembering technique : I remember the first day we met. She got my attention right away. I liked the way she looked. And I really liked how much fun she was. I rememner noticing how good she was at really listening when I spoke, and how good she made me feel because she was so interested in what I had to say. I knew immediately that she was someone whom I wanted to spend more time with. Remembering something from the past that felt good is a powerful tool for improving your vibration, because as you recall those better feeling times, you activate the vibration that was active then. Also it‘s not possible for you to focus upon what is happening and what has happened at the same time."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Imagining technique : I‘m imagining myself leaving the office and being happy about my work day being done. I visualize myself getting into my car. I‘m proud of this car. It‘s really a beauty. I turn on the CD player, and my wife‘s favourite CD begins playing. I smile because I knwo she was driving my car yesterday and playing her favourite music. We have this funny game going where she always leaves her favourite music in the player. Now I‘m eager to get home and hang out with her. She‘s a light-hearted girl who always makes me feel glad to be with her. I‘m a lucky guy. Notice that there‘s nothing serious or heavy happening in this visualization. You‘re not trying to make anything happen. You‘re not trying to reform your wife or change her. You‘re just making up a story for one purpose only – to cause yourself to feel good at the same time that you‘re focusing upon something that‘s important to you. This imagery, even though it may be complete fiction, has changed the relationship between the vibration that you‘ve been offering lately about your wife, and the vibration of your desire about your wife. Things will now have to improve. And, at the very least, you feel good right now. Abundance situation Current contrasting situation: My husband and I have both had jobs for years. We‘ve saved some money. Not a lot, but enough to live on for a year. We had a really great idea for our own business, and we had a friend who had enough money to help us get started, but now, after two years, we‘re still taking money from our savings to live on. And our savings account is going down fast. Resulting emotions, or indications of vibrational discord: I feel worried. I feel discouraged. Remembering technique : I remember getting my first real paycheck and how good it felt. I had no bills, and having that much money handed to me all at once made me feel rich. I remember feeling excited that week after week I was gonna receive another check, and another. Reactivating a good-feeling memory is an extremely helpful technique, becaue it‘s something that‘s actually happened to you. So it has a factual, or true, nature which holds little contradictory vibration for you. In other words, you believe it. When you reach into your past and activate a belief that mathces your current desire, you‘re now in that moment in vibrational alignment, and your manifestations will now improve. Imagining technique : I‘m writing the last check that will pay our friend back the money he loaned us to start our business. He‘s surprised and pleased that we are able to do it so quickly. I can visualize how happy my husband is as he hands our friend a check. They‘re such good friends. It felt good that our friend believed in our idea, and it feels wonderful that our idea have paid off, and we‘re having such wonderful success. And we‘re just getting started. There‘s so much more yet to be discovered, experienced and enjoyed. You cannot focus upon what you want and what you do not want at the same time. By using your imagination to deliberately conjure a good-feeling scenario, you immediately distract yourself from the unwanted reality. And your vibration shifts instantly, allowing your vibrational alignment with your own desires. If you really understood the power of your vibration, you would never focus upon an unwanted reality again. For your reality is extremely temporary, and it can be easily molded into situations, events, scenarios and conditions that please you."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Planetary situation Current contrasting situation: The planet seems unstable. There are so many earthquakes, mud slides, tidal waves and hurricanes that suddenly sweep in and cause destruction. I almost don‘t want my family to leave home for a fear of something will happen and we‘ll be separated from each other, or be hurt, or even worse. Resulting emotions, or indications of vibrational discord: I feel worried. I feel insecure. I feel fear. Remembering technique: I remember being a child, still living at home with my parents. There were two big lilac buches in our front yard, up against the fence. My mother used to let me take some old blankets outside, and I remember using clothes-pins to make a tent between those bushes. I spent hours there setting it up, rearranging it and playing with toys I brougt from my room. You see, it‘s not necessary that you solve the problems of the world, or even the problems of your own life before you can begin to feel better. Just by remembering a pleasant moment from a time gone by you can reactivate your vibratin of Well-Being. And when you‘re consistantly feeling Well-Being, nothing other than Well-Being can be your experience. Imagining technique : I see myself, my wife and my kids getting out of our car this wonderful hotel in the mountains. It‘s not a very well known place, but we go there every year. Kids always look forward to coming here because they‘re allowed to have the run of the place. They always meet other kids, and this carefree environment just feels great to all of us. We don‘t try to keep any strict schedules, we just do what we feel like doing when we feel like doing it. This exercise of thinking thoughts to deliberately produce a feeling, rather that thinking a thought and then having a feeling response, is an extremely valuable tool. When you care about how you feel, and you choose your thoughts because of the way they feel, you are in control of your vibrations, and of the relationship between your desires and beliefs. Many people believe that daydreaming or fantasizing is a frivolous use of time. We see it as utilizing your emotional guidance system for the purpose of directing the power of your mind to activate the vibration, which is your point of attraction. We see it as powerful deliberate creating. There is not a great difference between remembering and imagining, for in either case the object of your attention is not actually occuring in your now reality. When you focus positively apart from whatever is happening right now, you can activate a vibration that will attract something different into your experience. But if you insist on giving your attention only to the reality that exists, then nothing can change."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Chapter 40. Applying the Becoming Free of Debt process This process works best if your range on the emotional guidance scale is somewhere between (10) Frustration/Irritation/Impatience and (22) Fear/Grief/Depression/Despair/Powerlessness. To begin this process of becoming free of debt obtain a columnar writing pad with as many columns as you have monthly expenditures. Now, beginnning on the far left column write a heading that describes your largest monthly outgo. For example, if the largest check you write each month is your house payment, then you‘d write as a header: „House payment“. Next, on the first line beneath that header write the dollar amount of your house payment. Now circle this amount which represents the amount you‘re obligated to pay each month, and then on the third line enter the total outstanding debt for this house payment category. Next, in the second column enter your second largest payment. Then your third largest payment in the third column, and so on. And across the top of your columnar pad write the following affirmation: „It is my desire to keep my promise, regarding all of these financial obligations, and in some cases I will even do twice as much as required“. Each time you receive a bill, get out your columnar pad and adjust, if necessary, the minimum monthly amount that‘s required. If it stays the same, then write the same figure. The first time you receive a bill, or when it‘s time to make the payment for the category that‘s on the far right column of you pad, in other words, the smallest payment you make each month, write the check for exactly twice what is required. And as you do so, write in the new amount of that outstanding balance. This may seem a little strange to you when you first begin to play the game. But even if you do not have enough money to pay everything you owe in all of the columns, still double the payment in the far right column. And feel glad that you‘ve not only kept your new promise to yourself to do your best to pay everything you owe, but to do even twice that amount in some cases. Because you‘re now looking at your finaces in a way that‘s new, your vibration will begin to shift right away. As you feel even the slightest bit of pride for keeping your word, your vibration will shift. As you keep your promise about doubling up on some payments, your vibration will shift. And with this shift, even if it‘s slight, things will now begin to change in your financial condition. If you will take the time to really enter everything you owe onto the columnar pad, your newly focused attention will begin to positively activate circumstances around the subject of money for you. Instead of feeling discouraged as you find yet another bill in you mailbox, you‘ll feel an eagerness to enter the bill in your columnar pad. And with this shift in attitude and vibration, things will begin to change in your financial picture. Money that you are not expecting will appear in your experience. Bargains will reveal themselves, so your dollars will go further than you expected. All kinds of unusual financial things will occur. And when they do, be consciously aware that these things are happening in response to your newly focused attention and the result in shift in your vibration. As extra money appears, you‘ll find yourself eager to apply another payment at the far right column. And soon that debt will be paid. And you can eliminate that column from your pad. Column after column will disappear as your financial gap between what is coming in and what is going out widens. Your sense of financial Well-Being will improve on the first day you play this game. And if you‘ll take the game seriously, your vibration around money will shift so significantly, that you can be debt-free in a short time, if that is your desire. There‘s nothing wrong with debt. But if yours feels like a heavy burden, then your vibration around money is one of resistance. When the burden is lifted, when you feel lighter and free-er, your resistance has lifted, and you‘re now in the position to allow Well-Being to flow abundantly into your experience. Any of the processes that help you feel better, will also cause a shift in your vibration around money. However, this process is especially powerful, if you‘re troubled about your financial situation. Because it will cause you to look at your financial situation from a different perspective. Without realizing it, day by day you will have adopted a vibrational pattern about money in response to what‘s happening. But you had no vibrational control when you merely had a feeling response to the situation. This Becoming Free of Debt process elicits from you the same responsible approach that you‘re accustomed to regarding money, in that it asks you to keep records and to identify the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"amount of your debt, and so on. But it elicits a different perspective from you at the same time. You‘ll immediately begin to feel a shift as you think about what you CAN do instead of what you‘re unable to do. It‘s a pragmatic approach with a playful twist, which will shift your energy in the direction of your desire. If you will continue the process for a few weeks, within that short period of time your dread and fear, that you may have developed around the subject of money, will be replaced with hope, fun and eagerness.

Examples of applying the Turning-It-Over-To-the-Manager process Imagine that you‘re the owner of a very large corporation, and there‘re thousands of people who work for you. There are employees who assist in their manufacturing and marketing of your products, there are book-keepers, accountants, and advisors, there are artists, advertising experts.. thousands of people, all working to make your company successful. Now, imagine that you do not personally work with any of these people, but you have a manager who does. And your manager understands them, advises them and directs them. So, whenever you get an idea about something, you express it to your manager, who says, „I‘ll take care of that right away“. And he does, efficiently, effectively, precisely, just the way you like it. You may be saying to yourself right now, „I‘d love to have a manager like that. Someone I can count on. Someone who‘d work on my behalf“. And we say to you, you do have a manager who is that and much more. You have a manager who works continually on your behalf, called the LOA. And you have only to ask in order for this Universal manager to jump to your request. The key to the success of this Turning-it –over- to-the-manager process is to make request with an expectation of the request being fulfilled. It‘s like asking someone yuo trust who‘s never let you down to do something, knowing full well that he will get it done. That is the attitude from which you must make a request to the Universe. Make your request with the attitude of expecting results. Now, keep in mind, this process works best if your range on the emotional guidance scale is somewhere between (10) Frustration/Irritation/Impatience and (17) Anger.

Now, write the following short list in a place where it will be easy for you to read. And then, when you first lie down, read it slowly to yourself. It‘s natural for my body to be well. Even if I don‘t know what to do in order to get better, my body does. I have trillions of cells with individual consciousness and they know how to achieve their individual balance. When this condition began, I didn‘t know what I now know. If I had known then what I know now, this condition could not has gotten started. I don‘t need to understand the cause of this illness. I don‘t need to explain how it is that I‘m experiencing this illness. I have only to gently eventually release this illness. It doesn‘t matter that it got started because it‘s reversing its course right now. It‘s natural that it would take some time for my body to begin to align to my improved thoughts of Well-Being. There‘s no hurry about any of this. My body knows what to do. Well-Being is natural to me. My Inner Being is intricately aware of my physical body. My cells are asking for what they need in order to thrive, and Source Energy is answering those requests. I‘m in very good hands. I will relax now to allow communication between my body and my Source. My only work is to relax and breathe. I can do that. I can do that easily. Now, just lie there and enjoy the comfort of your resting place, and focus upon your breathing. In and out..In and out.. Breathe deeply while still remaining comfortable. Do not force it. Do not try to make anything happen. There is nothing for you to do other than to relax and breathe. You will very likely begin to feel soft gentle sensations in your body. Smile and acknowledge that this is Source Energy specifically answering your cellular request. You are now feeling the healing process. Do nothing to try to help it or intensify it. Just relax and breathe and allow it. If you were experiencing pain when you laid down, follow the same process. However, if you were feeling pain, it would be helpful for you to add these words to your written and spoken list: This sensation of pain is an indicator that Source is responding to my cellular request for energy. This sensation of pain is a wonderful indicator that help is on the way. I will relax into this sensation fo pain, because I understand that it‘s indicating improvement. Now, if you can drift off to sleep. Smile in your knowledge that all is well. Breathe and relax. And trust. Physical decline Current contrasting situation: I worry that my body is deteriorating.

The way my body looks and feels is a result of my vibration. My body is as it is right now, and that is alright. My body is continually changing. And that is alright. My vibrational offering affects the changes in my body. Physical decline is about vibration, not about passing through time. It‘s possible for me to pass through time and improve my vibration. Physical decline is neither natural nor necessary. I do not have to wait for others to know this or demonstrate this. I can begin now or whenever I choose to demonstrate this. A shift in my vibration won‘t give me instant physical evidence. A shift in my vibration will give me instant emotional evidence. Once I achieve a vibrational shift and stabilaze there, I‘ll see evidence. I‘m willing to shift my vibration and wait for the physical evidence. Feelling better emotionally will be adequate evidence for now. Finding and maintaining positive expectancy is wonderful. I can feel my body benefitting from my new-found ease. I can feel the stability of my physical body. I can feel the life giving qualities of my new energy alignment. I can feel that I‘m coming into energy balance. I can feel how much my body enjoys my energy balance. All is well with me right now and getting better still. If you will take your time to deliberately improve your emotional feeling about your physical body, your physical conditions will improve. Lead your improved conditions with improved expectations, and watch what happens. Remember, the manifestation always follows the vibration. And 99.99 percent of every creation is already complete before there is any physical evidence. Focus upon your emotional journey and find improvement there, and the physical, action journey, must follow. It is Law. There are no exceptions to this."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Chapter 43. Examples of applying the Moving-Up-The-Emotional-Guidance- Scale process Here is the way we would apply this powerful process. When you are aware that you‘re feeling some rather strong negative emotion, try to identify what that feeling or emotion is. In other words, consciously think about whatever is bothering you, until you can actually pinpoint the emotions that you‘re experiencing. This moving-up-the-emotional-guidance-scale process can be used no matter what your emotional state of being, but it‘s particularly helpful when you‘re feeling particularly bad. Considering the two extremes of this emotional guidance scale, you could ask yourself, „Do I feel powerful, or do I feel powerless?“. While you may not actually be feeling either one of these emotions precisely, you will be able to tell which way your emotional state of being is leaning right now. So, in this example if your answer is ‚powerless‘, then shorten the range that you‘re considering. In other words, ask yourself, „does this feel more like powerlessness, or frustration?“. Still more like powerlessness. Then shorten the range still further. Does this feel more like powerlessness, or worry? As you continue (there‘s no right or wrong approach to this), eventually you‘ll be able to state with accuracy what you‘re really feeling about the situation you‘re addressing. Once you found your place on the emotional guidance scale, your work is to try to find thoughts that give you a slight feeling of relief from the uncomfortable emotion you‘re feeling. A process of talking out loud, or writing down your thoughts will give you the best reading of the way you‘re feeling. As you make statements with the deliberate intention of inducing an emotion that gives you a slight feeling of relief, you‘ll begin to release resistance. And then you‘ll be able to move gradually up the vibrational scale to a place of feeling much better. Remember, an improved feeling means a releasing of resistance. And a releasing of resistance means a greater state of allowing what you really want. So, using the emotional guidance scale, and beginning with where you are, look at the emotion that‘s just about where you believe you are now, and try to fashion some words that will lead you into a slightly less resistant emotional state of being. Remember, yuo do not have access to emotions that are far from where you‘re currently vibrating. Therefore, although you may have spent an entire day beating the drum of the emotion where you are, on the next day try to establish a different set point, even if it is only a slight improvement. If the negative emotion you‘re feeling is slight, you‘ll quickly move up the emotional guidance scale. If the negative emotion you‘re feeling has begun only recently, you‘ll quickly move up the emotional guidance scale. If you‘re experiencing something extremely serious, or if it‘s something that you‘ve been troubled with for many years, it‘s conceivable that you can spend as many as 22 days moving up this emotional guidance scale, each day deliberately choosing the improved emotion just above the one you‘re currently feeling. But 22 days from powerless to empowerment is not a long time at all, when you compare it to people you know who have been in a state of grief, insecurity or powerlessness for many years. Now that you understand that goal is to simply reach a better feeling emotion, it is our expectation that this process will free you from troubling negative emotions that you‘ve been experiencing for years. And as you gently and gradually realease the resistance you‘ve annoyingly gathered, you will begin to experience gradual improvements in your life experiences in all troubling areas of your life.

The value of utilizing these process The most important thing that we want you to derive from reading these processes we‘ve just offered is a clear understanding of what your real work as a deliberate creator is - to bring the energy of your Being into alignment. In every example offered here, and in the examples from your own life, when you feel negative emotion, it always means the same thing: you have a desire pulsing within you that you‘re resisting and preventing from being actualized because you also have a contradictory vibration that is active. These processes have been offered to illustrate how to reduce that contradictory vibration. It‘s likely, as you read these processes, that you found yourself argueing with us on one topic or another, that the process or solution we offered did not solve the problem. In other words, „I can‘t see how this process is going to stop the ice-caps from melting, or actually make my neighbor get rid of the junk cars in front of his house“. But do not lose sight of what your work really is – the balancing of energy between your most often active vibrations, beliefs, and your desires, your intent. You must not put yourself in the impossible position of needing your neighbor to get rid of the junk cars before you come into energy alignment. Your happiness cannot depend upon what your government does, or what your mother does, or whether the ice-caps are melting or not. You must get control of the vibrational relationship between your desires and your beliefs, if you‘re gonna be a deliberate creator and be effective in accomplishing your own goals and desires, or be living in joy. Do not underestimate the power of energy alignment. The masters of your societies, the creative geniuses of your past and present civilizations found this alignment. There is a substantial difference in the words „believe in your dreams“, and actually being in vibrational alignment with your dreams. Your words are not your point of attraction, but your vibration is. If you will deliberately apply these processes with the intention of bringing the vibrations of your being into alignment, these processes will render you powerful. And in doing so, you‘ll become the powerful, joyful, deliberate creator of your own experience."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Chapter 45. 99 Percent Of Every Creation Is Complete Before You See Any Evidence Of It You are now aware that you‘re the attractor, or creator, of your own experience. And we want you to realize that only YOU are the attractor or creator of YOUR experience. We believe that you now understand more clearly than ever before how it is that you create, for you now realize that you‘re continually broadcasting a vibrational signal, which is your point of attraction. It is our desire that you‘re also now aware of your emotional guidance system, which indicates the vibrational relationship between your focused thought in this moment and the vibration of your desire. You can literally feel when you‘re moving toward or away from something wanted, and you can also feel when you‘re moving toward or away from something unwanted. We are pleased that you now understand or at least are beginning to understand that you can make every journey, from where you are to where you desire to be, quantifiable. Your journey to success on literally every subject of your desire need never again be confusing or confounding, for clear emotional signals are there to guide you in the direction of anything and everything you desire. Your day, every day, is comprised of stimulating, interesting, thought provoking moments that cause you, whether you know you‘re doing it or not, to emit vibrational signals that are projected into your future. And they‘re responsible for everything that happens to you. Every circumstance, every event and every meeting of every person – everything that you live is because of what you have been thinking about, wondering about, pondering, remembering, observing, considering and imagining. You are literally thinking your life into being. We are extremely pleased that you now understand the importance of your conscious awareness of your emotions, for they help you to understand, as you‘re remembering, pondering, observing or imagining, whether you‘re preparing your future with something you will enjoy when it manifests or something you will not enjoy. And since 99 percent of every creation is complete before you see any physical evidence of it, it is extremely valuable to understand what your emotions are telling you about the direction of your thoughts right now. By utilizing your emotional guidance system you‘re able to direct your thoughts in the direction of pleasing things before they manifest. But if you wait until a manifestation has occured, before you begin to redirect your thoughts, it is a much more difficult process for you. Because once some unwanted thing has manifested, it‘s now much harder to focus upon what you desire. When you accept that you are right now in the process of creating things that will manifest into your experience, and you‘re deliberately guiding your thoughts to good-feeling ideas, your future manifested experience will be filled with things that will delight you as they unfold into your experience. This book has been written to assist you in your conscious awareness of the unseen things, for now anyway, that you are in the process of creating. We do not believe that you would deliberately choose to bring cancer, a car accident, a financial disaster or a divorse into your experience, but because so much thought about those things is often offered without your conscious awareness that you‘re doing it, you are often surprised when an unwanted thing occurs. It sometimes seems to have come out of nowhere. But it did not come out of nowhere. And it did not come instantly. It came finally, after many many thoughts that matched it, radiated from you. But now, after reading this book, you will no longer be surprised when things, good or bad, manifest. For you will never again focus a thought and feel a coresponding emotion that indicates whether you‘re moving toward or away from something you want without knowing it. The vibrational relationship between your now and your future creation is now known by you. The end of the emotional guidance scale, that feels like passion, joy, appreciation and love, feels the way it does because of your perception of your own personal empowerment and freedom. The other end of the emotional guidance scale, that feels like depression and fear, feels the way it does because of your own personal perception of disempowerment and bondage. But now disempowerment need never be your experience again, for you know too much at this point. You now understand that the only thing that could ever prevent you from the joyous abundance of all"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"good things you desire is your own vibrational offering that takes you in the opposite direction from those things. You now understand that your glorious emotions are helping you establish your route, or course, on all subjects, and that by following the trait of increasingly good feeling emotions you‘ll project vibrational rockets into your future, which will yield a steady stream of lovely creations. Now, when you feel frustration mounting, or impatience, or anger surfacing, you can stop in a moment of true realization and ponder, just „what am I projecting into my vibrational escrow? Should I take a moment now and redirect my thoughts, and change the course of my probable manifestation? Or should I just let my thoughts run away with me, supported by LOA, and just live the consequences of my unmanaged, undirected thoughts?“ And although you can turn anything around at any time, even after manifestation, it is our encouragement that you turn it around while it‘s being vibrationally formed, for it‘s ever so much easier then. But even more important, we want you to consider the millions and millions of moments of your real life experience that could be feeling good now. Feeling good now. Feeling good now. Yes, of course manifestation will come. It certainly will come – good or bad, wanted or unwated. It is coming. But your life is now. Your emotions are now. The way you feel is now. Direct your thoughts to improve your now moment, and the manifestations will take care of themselves. We very much enjoy seeing your lives unfold from our Nonphysical vantage point. If you could see your future as we see it, you would realize – there are things wanted and unwanted that are in this very moment taking shape and form right outside your door, and today, tomorrow and the next day you‘re gonna add one more thought, one more focused vibration to what‘s already there, which will cause the tipping point, or manifestation point for you. So, it‘s really worth tuning into your glorious emotional guidance system to be aware of what you‘re on the brink of manifesting. You come forth into this body, focused in this leading-edge time/space reality, because you adore creation. There is nothing in all of the Universe that‘s more satisfying to you than to mold the energy that creates worlds with the power of your own focused mind. You did not come forth to fix a broken world, for your world is not broken. You did not come forth to help others to see the error of their ways, to redirect them. You did not come forth to gain the approval of another through some specific course of action. You came forth into this magnificent contrast for the thrill of feeling your own personal preferences being born. You came forth understanding that you would then be able to feel the vibrational relationship between your new desire and your current perspective. And you looked forward to the process of balancing the energy of those two vibrational vantage points. You came forth for the joy of giving birth to the new desire, and for the thrill of balancing the energy process. And yes, you look forward to the manifestation of your creations, but your true emphasis has always been upon the 99 percent of the creation that happens prior to the manifestation. The thrill of the manifestation, no matter what the creation, is but a brief thrill that quickly becomes the paltform from which you launch your next and your next and your next creation. But your life from your physical vantage point, or from your Nonphysical vantage point, is really about the 99 percent of creation that happens before manifestation. Today, no matter where I‘m going, no matter what I‘m doing, no matter who I‘m doing it with, nothing is more important than that I feel good. Today I will look for that which I am wanting to see. I am the creator of my own reality. Right now I will reach for the best feeling thought that I have access to. Thought by thought and feeling by feeling I will focus the vibrations of my mind into alignment. I will feel for the true vibrational essence of my being, and I will guide my every thought into vibrational alignment, for that is the true meaning of a balancing of energy."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Chapter 46. The amazing power of deliberate intent We‘ve written this book in response to your asking. For you want to understand who you really are, and how you fit into the larger picture, and you want to understand the purpose of this life experience, and how you can best fulfil your reason for being here in this body at this time. We want you to remember that you are an eternal creator who has come forth into this leading-edge to experience the joyous expansion of your Universe. We want you to remember your value, to know your worthiness and to love your life. We can feel the amazing power of your intent to understand how to deliberately create your own reality, and you have literally summoned us forth to help you remember who you are and what you really know. There‘s nothing more important for you, or more satisfying, than to come into deliberate alignment with your Source. To not only recognize the energy of your Source, but to deliberately align with it is the ultimate experience of bliss. This is the true meaning of balancing of energy, and it is the most important part of your life experience. When you are in vibrational alignment with your Source, whatever you‘re focused upon is receiving the focus of the energy stream that creates worlds. The power of that alignment cannot be adequately expressed in words, but you can feel it. You can feel it in your joy, love, exuberance and passion. If you‘ve studied with us over time, or even in the reading of this one small book, you‘ve been introduced to a variety of games, processes or techniques. It‘s not necessary for you to attempt to apply all of them, or even most of them, for they‘re all offered for the same reason, and each of them has power within them. Every process, as you apply it, will raise the vibration of your being. Every process, as you apply it, will bring you into closer alignment with who you really are. Ever y process will give you the feeling of relief, which indicates the releasing of resistance. Every process will help you to balance your energy. Every process will help you shorten the time between where you are currently standing and where you really intend to be. Do not make hard work of the application of these processes. Choose one that‘s most appealing, and use it as long as it still feels good. Then choose another, and another. The most important thing for you to remember is that the better you feel in any moment in time, the more in alignment with your Source and your desires you are. And nothing is more important than that you feel good. It‘s our desire that this book has liberated you from the only thing that could ever bind you or give you the impression that you are not free. For the only bondage that really exists is a perception of powerlessness. You are only powerless if you‘re not in alignment with your power. And only you possess the key to that alignment. No-one can take that from you. It is only yours to hold. So, your work, your only work, but it is your steady work, for it‘s work that cannot be completed, is a constant awareness of the vibrational relationship between your focus in this moment and the focus of your Inner-Being in this moment. Your Inner-Being is aware of your hopes and dreams, and is focused upon them. When you fail to focus upon them, you feel the resistance. Your Inner-Being is aware of your value and worthiness. When you focus otherwise, you feel the resistance. Your Inner-Being expects your success. When you do not, you feel the resistance. Your Inner-Being enjoys the continuing process of expansion. When you are impatient, you feel the resistance. Your Inner-Being knows that you‘re eternal. When you feel you do not have enough time, you feel the resistance. Your Inner-Being knows there are no limits to your ability to create. When you feel diminished, you feel the resistance. Your Inner-Being adores others who share your planet. When you find fault with them, you feel the resistance. Your Inner-Being knows everyone has access to the same power. When you take responsibility for the lives of others, you feel the resistance."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"So, pick and choose among the techniques that we‘ve offered, and remember there is no one right way to accomplish this alignment. Play with it. Be flexible about it. Try as much as you can and do not judge your results. Just make a decision that no matter what the topic of discusion, being from past, present or future, you are going to approach it in the best feeling way that you can from where you are right now. And with that decision your life will turn immediately in the direction of thriving. We‘ve written this book to help you to understand the following most important things in response to what we‘ve been hearing from so many of you: Yuo are a vibrational being first and foremost. And you live in a vibrational universe. The vibrations of this universe are perfectly managed by the powerful LOA. You cannot cease continually offering vibrations. The LOA makes it easy for you to fall into habits or patterns of vibrational offering. Watching other people around you influences your vibrational offerings. Observing your own life experience influences your vibrational offering. Most people offer vibrations primarily in response to what they‘re observing. The vibrations that you offer are your point of attraction. What you think, the vibrations that you offer, and what you are living always match. No matter what words you use (I‘m focusing, I‘m thinking, I‘m remembering, I‘m pondering, I‘m observing, I‘m imagining, I‘m dreaming), you‘re offering vibrations that the LOA is responding to. The more attention you give to any thought, the more dominant it becomes in your vibration. Your life experience is only about the thoughts you think. You are the creator of your own reality. Whenever you give your attention to anything, you activate the vibration of it in you. The more you give you attention to any thought, the more active it becomes in your vibration, until in time it becomes a dominant vibration, or a dominant player n your point of attraction. Those dominant vibrations are the basis of everything you‘re living and of everything you believe. A belief is only a thought yuo keep thinking. Through much experience, much observation, and much focusing of thought you attract the physical manifested equivalent. 99% of every creation is completed before you see any physical evidence of manifestation. Right now your future is full of potential manifestations as a result of the thoughts you‘ve been thinking. Some of those manifestations will please you when they manifest, and some of them will not please you. It is much easier for you to turn the tide of your vibration more in the direction of things you want to experience before manifestation takes place. There are many things that you desire in various stages of readiness for you to experience, and your emotional guidance system will help you continue to move toward those wanted things. You must find a way to deactivate your vibration regarding any unwanted things that are making their way into your immediate and distant future. Deactivation of unwanted vibrations is the same process as activation of wanted vibrations. You cannot activate something wanted and something unwated at the same time. It is one or the other. And your emotions are very clear about which way you‘re focused. It is necessary that you quantify each journey by being aware of the emotions that you feel before you can move only toward wanted outcomes. You are pure positive Source energy, focused in your physical body, intending to benefit from contrast, because it helps you to decide and define your unique preferences. By reaching for the best feeling thoughts you can find regarding any subject at any time you‘re tending to the vibrational realtionship between your now in the moment thoughts and the thoughts of your Source. So, as you‘re moving through your day today, be aware that you‘re creating your own reality, feel the emotions that flow upward into your conscious awareness and acknowledge their enormous value to you. No matter how the emotion feels, good or bad, soft or strong, smile and recognize pride at your awareness of the emotion and of its meaning to you. Acknowledge that it is a vibrational indicator pointing out to you your alignment to your Source and your desires. No matter what the current emotion within you, feel glad for your awareness of it, and know that you can choose thoughts to improve your emotion, and therefore improve the vibrational relativity between you and you any time, any place, and under any circumstance that you choose. See yourself as energy. See your Source as energy. Be ever aware of the vibrational relationship between those energies. The balancing of the energy of your being is not something like a college degree that once you achieve it is yours forevermore. It is or it is not in the moment. You could always feel your alignment or misalignment, your balance or imbalance, your connection or diconnection, your"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"allowing or disallowing of that connection. You are Source energy here in this physical body, and life is supposed to be good for you. You are worthy, you are blessed, you are creator, you are here on the leading-edge of thought to experience the joy of riding the wave of the expansion that is the promise of this ever lasting life. You cannot get it done, not ever. You cannot get it wrong, because it is never done. We want to express our knowledge of the value of your life. It‘s our desire that you make peace with where you are on every subject of your life, understanding that from there you can go anywhere you choose. If you condemn your current position, or feel guilty or blame about where you stand, your future will offer little change at all. But as you soften your discomfort, and try to improve the way you feel just a little bit, your vibration will begin to shift, the LOA will help the momentum to continue, and you can get to where you want to be in a very short period of time. Be easy about it. Be playful about it. Every day say to yourself, „Nothing is more important than that I feel good. The better I feel, the more I‘m allowing all the wonderful things of life to flow to me“. There is great love here for you. And for now this book is complete."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"About the authors Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those persons who were asking meaningful questions regarding finances, bodily conditions, and relationships . . . and then successfully applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations— Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of answers to how to live a better life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, Conference Center as their base, Esther and Jerry have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Art of Allowing Workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this progressive stream of thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading-Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person— as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. The Hickses have now published more than 600 Abraham-Hicks books, cassettes, CDs, videos, DVDs.
