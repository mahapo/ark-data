We want you to feel unlimited where you stand. We want you to know that anything that you desire can be yours. We want you to adore yourselves and love yourselves, and know your deservabilityóto under- stand your worthiness. We want you to stand in your now and allow the source that is you to flow through you. We want you to define yourself as someone who is eager and full of life and free and fun and easy. We want life to be good for you. We want you to live the lives that you promised yourself you would live. And if it were not for this cloud of belief that mutes that and hinders that youíd be there right now. And thatís what virtual reality will do for you. It will, YOU will, use it to decide what vibration within you is dominantó about everything. So that, when some smart-alec dead guy like Abraham says to you, later on, ìSo whatís domi- nant in your vibration about your body?î You will say, ìI feel good. I feel surefooted. I feel clear-minded. I feel eager. I feel adventure. I love my body. It serves me so well. I feel steady, and confident and beautiful and adventurous and eager. I feel ready.î îWell, how do you feel about your dollars?î îI feel fantastic. I feel sure. I feel full. I feel unlimited.î And we say, ìWell howís your life?

We are extremely pleased that you are here. It is good to come together for the purpose of co-creating, do you agree? You are knowing what you are wanting? It changes ... eter- nally evolving. You are enjoying the evolution of your desire? You like that feeling of a fresh new awareness, a new desire coming into your consciousness? That feeling of adventure and wonder, delight with a new idea? Yes? Not so much? If the new idea or desire breathes life into you, then we suspect that you have reconnected with your inner knowing. But if the new desire tortures you a little, antagonizes you, if when you have a desire that isnít fulfilled you feel uncomfortable in its not-yet manifestation, then you still have not remembered that you are leading-edge creators and that you will never get it done, that there will always be a fresh new desire. When you realize that you are leading-edge creators and that the new desire that is born within you is literally what summons life to you, then you no longer feel frustra- tion about what is not yet manifested. Instead you feel appreciation for the life-giving desire that still summons through you. But we understand how when you have not consciously addressed the subject of resistance within your own vibration how new desires could sometimes not feel so good. Because when you really want something and you cannot for the life of you figure out how to bring it about, if youíve got something that is plaguing you, something that youíd dearly love to get rid of and just canít seem to rid yourself of, we understand how you might be out of balance with the idea of desire, so much so that you might even begin to condemn it, begin to say that desire is inappropriate ó which is odd since the entire Universe is based upon this attraction-based effect where desire is born and it has the summoning capability that literally summon life force forward which keeps us all moving forward. It is so much more comfortable when you get in synch with the laws of the Universe. It doesnít work too well when you jump off the cliff determined to defy gravity, and it doesnít work too well when you go against the stream, or flow, of Source. Thatís what resistance is. Resistance is not going with the flow of your own well-being. Most clear statement weíve ever made. Resistance is not going with the flow of your own natural well- being. Well-being flows, and when you are in alignment with it you feel wonderful. And when you are not in alignment with it, you donít feel so good. So anger is you not going with the flow of well- being. Frustration is you not going with the flow of well-being. Fear is you not going with the flow of well-being. So you say ìHow can I stand in this condition, knowing what I know and observing what I observe, and not feel these negative emotions?î And we say you have to practice . You have to decide that *youíre* going to be in charge of how you vibrate, *youíre* going to be in charge of how you feel. Youíre not going to be buffeted about like a cork on a raging sea. Youíre going to practice your vibration so that *you* can determine how you vibrate, how you flow, how you attract."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 Through time, as youíve been interacting with one another, as youíve been responding to the circumstances that surround you, you have developed some vibrational patterns. And many of them serve you. Many of your vibrational patterns are vibrational patterns of positive expectation. We look at those of you who are in this environment and we notice how magnificently you expect. Your standard of living is superb. You expect life to go well, to a certain extent. And what weíre wanting to assist you in doing is expecting it to go well in all regards. We want you to get so good at thinking thoughts deliberately, at setting your own tone, that *you* get to decide what your dominant vibration is about the subjects that are important to you, rather than having let something when you were three set the tone and you just keep doing it or something that mass consciousness is thinking about set the tone. We want you to get so good at choosing what your dominant vibration is that under all conditions you offer it. Thatís a key word that we are offering you here - dominant vibration - because you all have dominant vibrations relative to major subjects in your experience, and some of your dominant vibra- tions are serving you and some of your dominant vibrations are not serving you. For example, when you think about the subject of dollars or financial abundance, do you feel adventurous and eager and unlimited or do you feel worried and uncertain and limited? You know! Some of you may say ëwell I feel some of all of thatí and we say yes, you do, but you know which is dominant. You can tell which way that leans. You know. When you think about your major relationship, the most significant relationship, the one that you think about the most or the one you interact with the most, does that relationship feel like fun and life-giving, or does it feel like struggle and hard work. You know. When you think about your physical body, does it feel flexible and strong, and sure-footed, or do you feel tentative and uncertain. You know. Relative to every subject that you ponder, and especially those major subjects, you have little by little by little by little by little developed vibrational patterns - you could call them ëbeliefsí - we donít want to give them too much weight - habits of thought that you keep thinking. And the reason that you keep thinking them is because you havenít decided to think otherwise and so the thought that you think you think which attracts to it so you think it some more which attracts to it so you think it some more which attracts to it so you think it some more. IOW, when you have an expectation, youíve got a dominant thought going on and LOA is going to deliver that to you again and again and again. And you say ìThe reason that I believe this is because it is true!î And we say the reason that you belive it is because youíve practiced the thought, because all that a belief is is a thought that you keep practicing. And you say ìBut the reason I belive it is because it is true!î And we say ìAnd why is it true?î It is because you think it. It is because somewhere you got the thought, you held the thought, you let it become dominant in your vibration, LOA responded to that vibration and made it evidential in your experience. And so you say ìItís true!î And what we are wanting you to come to realize is you can make well-being ìtrueî. Or you can make not-well-being true. Cancer is ìtrueî. Itís just not usually wanted. Violence is ìtrueî, itís just not usually wanted. And we want you to begin to realize that ìfacing the factsî because they are ìtrueî only per-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 petuates the ìtruthî you would not choose for yourself. So when you begin to think about the dominant thoughts that you have, and more importantly, you begin to think about *choosing* thoughts that you want to make dominant, we have a process for you that will work if you will work it. And we call it ì the process of Virtual Reality î. Youíve played this game under other titles. Weíve called it ìcreative visualizationî. Weíve called it ìusing your imaginationî. Virtual Reality is a game where, like a director of a movie, you set the scene - you know what you want your audience to feel, and so you set them up for it. You make it winter or you make it summer. You put it in the mountains or you put it on the ocean or you put it on the beach. You put it outdoors or you put it indoors. You make it daytime. You make it nighttime. IOW, you set the scene. It has one intent only, and that is the intent of your practicing a vibration with the singular purpose of making it a dominant vibration. Sometimes people will use visualization to try to fix something that is broken. And we want you to use Virtual Reality for one reason only - to make the vibration that *you* choose dominant. Letís say that your nation is really worried about something, and itís hard for you not to give it thought because when you turn on the television it is there, you hear others talking about it, your teachers are talking about it in the classrooms of your children, people are having discussions about it all around you. But when you think about it, you know its not a thought that you want to make dominant within you because you feel fear when it crosses your mind, or anger, or frustration, or worry. So you say ìOK. I will choose another thought and make it dominant.î The feeling is I need to deactivate the thought that already *is* dominant. But the trouble with that is when you decide that youíre going to deactivate a thought, you donít deactivate it, you activate it. When you say ìIím not going to think about thatî, youíre thinking about that which youíre not going to think about. Even when you say ìI donít want to be sick, Iím going to think about wellnessî, when you approach the subject of your physical body when your dominant thought about it has been sickness, even though you try to do a Virtual Reality about wellness, you usually activate the thought of illness because thatís the dominant thought relative to that subject. You see how it works? So thereís a temptation when you apply these processes to say ìOh Abraham is giving me a process where I can fix this thing thatís brokenî, and all it does is activate the thing thatís broken. So, without meaning to, you just practice making the dominant thought that isnít serving you remain dominant. This process of Virtual Reality will change that for you if you will understand this one very important thing. The process of Virtual Reality is where you practice your dominant thought. Itís where you practice the thought that you want to be dominant until it is dominant. Virtual Reality is the place where you practice the thought that you want to be dominant and make it dominant. Virtual Reality is the place where you practice the thought that you want to be dominant and you make it dominant. And the reason that weíre repeating this into the ridiculous is because at first youíre not going to want to do that. Even Esther as sheís been practicing this for a few weeks now finds herself sometimes right in the middle of a delicious Virtual Reality and all of a sudden she realizes sheís trying to reform some-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7 one, either herself or someone else. IOW, sheíll be going along swimmingly doing very very well and then sheíll stumble into something and without even meaning to sheíll active something that is broken so to speak. So, Virtual Reality really works best if its short. Get in, feel good, get out. Get in, feel good, get out. So, you set the scene. What time of year is it? What time of day is it? Where is it, outside, inside? Y ou get to choose. There is no right and wrong in that. What youíre reaching for are good-feeling moments. You know those moments when your heart is just singing so strong and you just think ìI wish I could stay here forever!î? Does that usually happen to you when youíre outdoors or indoors? If itís more often outdoors, then pick a scene thatís outside. If itís more often indoors, then pick a scene thatís indoors. Esther, quite often in her Virtual Reality, sheís walking into a new place that is very beautiful and often itís indoors. Sometimes she finds herself discovering a magnificent vista, and that moment of exhilaration is there. Thatís what youíre reaching for. So you set the place and the time of year and the time of day, and then you talk to yourself about how it smells and looks and feels. Youíre sort of bring yourself along little by little into this higher higher better better good good feeling place. And then you decide who else is with you. Sometimes, in the beginning, better to be alone, but not always. You get to decide that. Who else is there? And whatís their mood? And, of course, you get to choose it so donít bring someone whoís in a bad mood and then work them into a good mood. Bring good mood people. And then exchange a few words ó and off you go. And what will happen is, as you do this for 30 seconds, you set a tone in your vibration. Does it immediately become your dominant tone or your dominant vibration? No. But it begins to dilute what is. So then you do it again and you do it again and you do it again and you do it again, and you *donít* do it because thereís something broken that you want to fix because if you do it because thereís something broken that you want to fix, you just practice the one thatís already dominant. This is *only* to feel good, *only* to feel good. And with a few weeks of dabbling at this, you will readjust what is dominant within your vibration. You see, the creative process is three steps. The first step is you have to identify what is wanted and you canít help but do that. Preferences are born within you all day every day. Contrast helps you to conclude. When you know what you donít want, what you do want shoots out of you like a rocket. Whenever you know what you do not want, clarity about what you do want comes forth in very vivid terms. So, Step 1 is happening all over the place. Step 2ís not your work. Source Energy will answer. Step 2 is the answering of what is being asked and that is not you work. Step 3 *is* your work. You *must* be in the receiving mode, you *must* be a vibrational match, you *must* be vibrationally equivalent, you must *not* be vibrationally different, you must *not* be vibrationally resistant, you *must* be vibrationally harmonious with that which you are asking for. Thatís what ìbeing in the receiving modeî is. Youíve got to line up with your own desire. So, when you realize that Step 1 and Step 3 are not the same step, and you realize that you canít help but offer Step 1 - itís happening all over the place - then we think it would be a good idea for"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 *you* to make your dominant priority be being in Step 3, which means nothing is more important to you that to be in the receiving mode of well-being. And thatís where this Virtual Reality comes in. It will help you train *you* back into vibrational harmony with allowing the well-being that is natu- ral to you. You see a confusing point that so many human friends have is that there is this source of bad and this source of good and that Iíve got to really focus hard upon everything that I want and I have to keep talking about what I want and if I want something that I donít have I have to be focused upon it realy really really really steadily in order to bring it about. IOW, Iíve got to set a goal and Iíve got to keep fixated on that goal or I wonít bring it about. And thatís just not true. You launched those goals. Source Energy is answering those goals or those desires, and what youíve got to do is just be in a place where youíre not is the way, where youíre not vibrationally in the way. You hear in your physical environment ìLet go and let Godî. And what they are talking about is relaxing that resist- ance and allowing the well-being that is natural to flow into your experience. And so this Virtual Reality game is a really good game to help you deliberately change your vibration. Now, do you need to do something like a Virtual Reality game in order to do that? No. You could get into modes of appreciation. You could be someone who is always looking for positive aspects. IOW, there are lots of tools that we and others have offered that help you become a vibra- tional match to well-being, that allow the well-being flow into your experience. Weíve just noticed that so many of you have these things that you really really really really really want and you canít figure out why youíre not getting them. And we want you to know that it only can be that you are offering a vibration that is different from what youíre asking for. And the reason that that must be happening is that at an unconscious level youíve got some patterns of thought going on that you donít even know youíve got going on. And so by deliberately offering thought, two things will happen. It will get easier for you to discover the thoughts that *allow* what you want and you will be *more* aware of when you are doing opposite. The other day Esther said to Jerry ìYou know, what Iím worried about is....î, and Jerry said ìThatís a whopper of a Virtual Reality!î Because when you say ìYou know, I really worry about somethingî, think about it. Youíve set the scene, youíve identified your mood, youíve decided who else will be there, youíve exchanged words .... IOW, youíre practicing a Virtual Reality that is not serving you every time you say ìI worry about thisî. Or ìI rememberî. When you remember youíre doing a Virtual Reality because you are reacti- vating everything that happened in that memory and making it a vibrational part of now. So what *are* you remembering? The thing about trying to change memories or trying to sift through memo- ries is that they are what they are, and when you tap back into one of them it activates! IOW, when you think about some of those memories, your mood comes over you all at once, doesnít it? Have you ever had something unpleasant happen while a particular song was playing? And now if you ever hear that song, you almost without knowing it immediately go back to that mood that you felt there. Fragrances do that to you too. There are a lot of different things that happen in your day to day experience that activate vibrations within you that do not serve you. Well, no longer are you a ëvictimí to the circumstances or to what somebody else can activate"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 around you, because now you have a tool where you can practice activating vibrations that serve you and with thirty days of practicing activating vibrations, you will be *free* of all vibrations that have not been serving you. It is our absolute promise to you. So weíre not going to deactivate anything. Why? Because it is not possible. Because when you look at that thing that you want to deactivate, it activates. Instead weíre going to practice activating on purpose . And when you activate vibrations on purpose, you change your point of attraction. And when you change your point of attraction, you change what happens to you. So the reason that this is a very easy, comfortable, joyful, really good process to begin getting good at is because as you practice the Virtual Reality, you win, win, win, win, win, because you feel good while youíre doing it, your vibration shifts which means your point of attraction shifts, which means the things that start coming to you change which is fun as they come, and it gets easier and easier and easier, because as you practice something that feels good more good things come and before you know it now you can practice a little and observe a lot and practice a little and observe a lot. You find yourself just saying things like ìOoh, thatís beautifulî and ìIsnít this funî and ìWasnít that a nice comment* and ìDonít you just love thisî and ì Donít I have a good lifeî and ìArenít I doing goodî and ìArenít we having a glorious timeî and ìIsnít this a wonderful thingî. IOW, it just gets better and better and better and better and better. And easier and easier and easier and easier and easier."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 Breathing Deep breathing is a big part of your Well-being, because with that deep breath, there is activa- tion on a cellular level. In other words, it is the current that carries the vitality to the extremities of the cells. And so, the more you are breathing, the more you are thriving. Some say it is the way the Spirit moves. We would say it is the way life moves most efficiently through your physical body. And, fortunately, it is something that is not left to your conscious mind. You donít have to prompt yourself to breathe. It happens. But, you can prompt yourself to breathe more. We encourage that you deliberately take some air in. And then before you let it out, take some more air in. And before you let it out....And you say, ìI canít take any more in, because thereís no place for it to go.î And we say, yes there is, take some more in. Expand your capacity. Your lungs, like balloons, can be all shriveled up, or expanded fully. As you move on a regular basis, they expand somewhat, but they donít expand fully. As you deliberately breathe deeper, it becomes more natural for them to get fulleróand before you know it, it will be an involuntary thing. You will naturally breathe more deeply. .....and you bodies will thrive. Itís even more important than drinking water. Itís right up there with life itself. When concentrating on your breathing, you are not concentrating on other things. And in that absence of resistance, you are also allowing an alignment of Energy. So you get a double whammy with it: Youíre aligning with Source Energy. You are literally feeding the cells of your body, allowing oxygen to reach the extremities of your cells. Everybody comes aliveóand everything works better. Metabolism works better, elimination works better, clarity works better, blood flows better. Thriving comes from this. Excerpted from Abe workshop....11/25/00 ps...This ìValue of Conscious Breathingî is on the last page of ìSara, Book 3î"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11 Have a nice day AbeÖÖ..In the attitude of appreciation, right before you slumber, you will get tomorrow off on the best possible foot, so that when you awaken you will be in that Energy of connection. We would awaken and do whatever you need to do first thing in the morning in terms of brush- ing your teeth and tending to your comfort ó even eating. And then we would go to a comfortable quiet spot and we would sit with a piece of paper before us and we would draw a line down the center of the page and we would write as the heading on the left side ìThings I Really Intend To Do Todayî. We would just sit there and write the things that first come to mind. ìWhat is it I most need to do today? What do I plan to do today?î They will come easily if you are in that framework of Well-being. And then we would sit there for another three or four minutes and just ponder the things that we would like the Universe to work on. things that we want, like a baby or like a family that is more in harmony with self, or like world peace....Anything that you want that you are not ready to take action on, we would write it on the Universeís side of the Place Mat. In other words, we would turn the Universe loose on those things, while we would assign ourselves to these things on the left side of our page. And then we would go about our day. Now, throughout this day, we would be intimately aware of the way that we feel ó and we would do our very best to guide our thoughts to the things that are vibrational matches with what feels good. So through the day, our intent would be to be sensitive to the way we feel. And if we found ourselves feeling ornery or aggravated or irritable or disappointed about something, we would stop right in the middle of that feeling, as soon as we identified it, and we would say, ìHum, what is it that I am making a vibrational match with right now? This ornery feeling is a match with things going wrong. Itís a match with not getting what I want. Itís a match...î And within about thirty seconds, you would be laughing about the silliness of this vibrational match. Now, sometime during the day, maybe on a segment of refreshment that you call lunch or maybe when you get home from work or maybe even while youíre sitting at your desk at work ó two or three times during the day, we would take some time to actually doodle some things in the Creation Box ó and at all times during the day we would be observing things that we would like to put in the Creation Box. In other words, the day would be a day...and one of you said it beautifully in your earlier statement when you said ìIíve been collecting a lot of data.î That really is the function of your day. Itís the collection of data. Now friends, you all thought that it was the work that you did that equaled your lifeís success. You all thought that it was the asking of the people to join you in relationships that was the action of your success. What weíre wanting you to hear from us ó and weíre wanting to put it in a framework that you can really hear ó the whole point of your day-to-day action experience is one singular thing: To collect data for your Box. Your Box represents your point of vibrational attraction. So the whole point of the day is to just look for good stuff to bring to the Box. Thatís the whole point of the day. Thatís the point of work. Thatís the point of relationships. Thatís the point of television. Thatís the point of everything that exists upon your planet. It is there for your data collection. Look for the good stuff and bring it to your Box.

Law of Attraction is the Primary Law upon which all creation is based. It says: Like attracts like. As moulders of energy we can either create by default when we observe what is and react in preset learned ways. Deliberate creators set their own tone unconditioally. There are three steps to creation. 1) From availbale contrast we formulate a desire 2) The Universe answers 3) According to our vibrational set up manifestation occurs. Creation by default: 1) We observe conditions and formulate a desire often in terms of exclusion - I do not want ... 2) The Universe answers 3) According to our vibrational set up of fear, worry, anxiety, doubt or other form of resistance and limiting beliefs we experience unwanted manifestations Deliberate Creation: 1) We observe conditions and formulate desires of inclusion - I want ... 2) The Universe answers 3) According to our vibrational set up of appreciation, joy, eager anticipation, acceptance and love we experience wanted manifestations. About step 2 we need to remember that the Universe has unlimited ways and means to orches- trate the answers. How the desire is answered is not our work. Our work is to formulate positive desires and to get out of our own way to open up for life force to flow through us and manifestations to occur. During the next 30 days we are going to use whatever tools and techniques we can apply to reduce our resistances to and increase our allowing of the flow of universal live giving energy through us.

This is an evolution of a species that is extraordinary. Your bodies are not to be feared. Your bodies are to be revered. Your bodies are to be applauded. Your bodies are to be maybe even amazed at. But they are never to be feared. Your bodies are not vulnerable. Theyíre not fragile. They are resilient. They are flexible. You have the ability to come into alignment again and again and again, and if anyone in the Universe understands that, itís the cells of your body. Befriending your body is the only way we know of coming to understand that your body is resilient and that it knows what to do, and that it will be whatever you ask it to be. But you have to ask it to be that in a place of nonresistance. Itís the most significant information that we have ever expressed relative to your physical body and food. You must love your body, and then lovingly give it the food. And when you love your body and lovingly give it the food, it matters not what food you give it.

And YES when you allow the energy to flow the manifestations are going to happen and thats wonderful.

And we dont know of anything that you want or ever wanted, whether its a relationship, or a material object, or a state of being, we have never seen any of you want anything for any other reason that you thought in the experiencing of it you feel good. Some would say ìWell if I could just get over there I would feel better.î And we say well we know that but you have to feel better before you get over there. And you say ìBut I cant feel better because Im over here! I need to be over there to feel better.î And we say well talk about whats over there and you will feel better right away. But many of you are SO STUBBORN, you say ìNo! When i get over there i will talk about over there, while i am over HERE i want to talk about over HERE!î And we say well tell us something good about whats over here. And they say ìTheres nothing good about over here. I want to be over there.î (laughter) And we say well you cant get over there until you feel good about being over there.

We have many clubs that we have joined (laughter) about not liking being over here and of all the time it took us to get here. I think I was born here!

Abraham: When we hear someone say they donít know what they want... which is a little different... or ìI donít know what I want to doî, we want to argue with you just a little bit and say: well we think you know what you want. We think that you know that you want it to be stimulating. You want to be fascinated. You want to be of value. You want to contribute, you want to make a difference. You want to move forward. You want financial remuneration. You want to be interested in what youíre doing... weíre repeating but thatís a big part of it. You want it to be something that is satisfying. So what weíre really hearing from you is: ìI must surely know what I want, but I donít know where to get it. I donít know how to go about it. I donít know how to orchestrate it. And we say thatís not your job. Remember step one is the asking, step two is the answering, and step three is the letting it in. So, you are far better off ... sort of chilling out, reminding yourself that everythingís all right, that youíre on schedule, that youíll know it when you see it, that everythingís gonna be all right, that perfect things are coming to you.. than if you were out clambering around in a state of frustration trying to bang something into place or trying to make something happen. Questioner: So I shouldnít like go apply for jobs and do action oriented things? Abraham: Well you can if you want to because that can be fun also. In other words, sometimes by beginning something even though itís not your dream job, in the process your desire is stimulated further. Our friend was talking about being in a 7 year law suit that she can actually acknowledge has left her in a better place because the experience itself has helped to clarify. So, we do not mean that you should do absolutely nothing. But one thing we would really clearly advise.. and that is that you try your best to follow your bliss. That you donít do something because you ëshouldí, or you donít do something because somebody else thinks you should. You do it because it feels like it might be fun, or it feels like it might be a good idea. Questioner: Well when I do something like that.. .. for example, I was taking voice lessons and in the beginning it was fun and now it isnít fun any more. And I donít know if itís not fun because Iím afraid that Iím not any good or itís because.... Abraham: Well from what we can feel from you about that.... in the beginning your vibration was pure because you were hopeful, you were anticipating fun things, you were anticipating wonderful things, and in the pro... always, when weíre watching someone... whether theyíre building an empire or a relationship or anything really... the majority of the energy flows while itís still in the dreaming stages. Because thereís a tendency once you get in the action stages to get bogged down in the parts of it that you do not like. And so we would say that all thatís happened"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 with your new music is that youíve got thought focused upon where you are, instead of on where youíre going. Questioner: So where Iím going on me getting better or where Iím going with my music in the future? Abraham: Either one. In other words, what youíre wanting to do is keep reminding yourself of *why* youíre doing it... not the nitty gritty of *what* youíre doing. Weíve noticed as weíve watched all of you that your energy is always pure when youíre thinking about what you want and WHY you want it than it is when youíre thinking about what you want and how youíre gonna get it and where itís gonna come from or whose gonna help you because you donít have answers to those questions. And so all it does is activate the vibration of doubt and worry. Where if youíre thinking about what you want and WHY you want it, itís usually a vibration of allowing that allows the Universe to open more doors for you.

As weíve watched so many people who are really practicing deliberate creation what we notice is: when they really get tenacious and start hitting things really head on they, almost without exception, begin falling into the category of ëtrying too hard.í <snip> So as you are thinking in terms of goals, thatís more like step one and thereís not anything wrong with it. But, we would put more emphasis on step three. <snip> And so, what youíre wanting to do is deliberately look for things that allow the well-being. And we think it is a more productive utilization of your time, than setting goals or focusing on goals ALTHOUGH - focusing on things that you want, and watching your progress toward them is a very satisfying experience. So what are we saying here? It sounds like we are saying focus - donít focus. It sounds like we are saying set goals - but donít set goals, instead allow. It sounds like Abraham is all over the place. And what weíre saying to you is.. feel your way through it. Set a goal and as long as it feels good, focus on the goal. But if you start noticing youíre worried about the goal then donít think about the goal. Think about something else and trust that the goal has already been established, the universal forces are working on it, and you work to get yourself into the receiving mode. Physical humans are so accustomed to paying a price for your receiving, that itís hard for you to hear, that for the most part, paying a price is what puts it off longer. Because in your struggle, youíre not in the receiving mode, you see. So. Would we set goals? Yes, we would. Would we talk about them a lot after weíve set them? No. We would sort of release them to the universe. Direct your thought and let it be. You get to choose. But you have a staff... an endless staff.. other humans, others who are willing to assist you. But youíve gotta be in the place of letting it in. 7/6/02 JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25 Remember the good things of the day, list of success About today I liked and enjoyed:............................................................................................... .. ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ......................

You turn on the television and they have an agenda! They have an agenda that they want to activate within you. So when you turn it on and you just watch it, they make your virtual reality. They play the music, they show you the scenes. In other words, they conclude how you will feel. They make you feel vulnerable so you will want their service or product. They make you feel in need of what they have to offer - whether itís the newscast, or somebody that is selling something. And we are not saying that some of that does not serve you and some does not enhance your physical experience. But what we will say is, youíre letting them program the vibrational nature of your being. So much so that if you do a poll across your nation and you say ìIs it natural to decline as you move through time?î, almost everyone says ìyesî and it is NOT natural! So much so that if you do a poll across your nation and said ìWill you need financial assistance in taking care of your poor decrepit and broken body in the last days of your life?î, almost everybody says ìYes.î They are horrified if they donít have some plan to deal with the inevitable siege of disgusting decline. And we say ìWHERE DO YOU GET THIS STUFF?î You get it from those who want to sell you remedies for disgusting decline. You donít get it from your source. Your source doesnít believe it. You donít get it from your beasts. Your beasts donít believe it. You get it from each other but you get it from those whoíve discovered that THEY can set the tone of your vibration. And you say ìGo ahead, Iím too lazy to do it myself. Itís easier for me to go to a movie and evoke mood within me, than it is for me to gaze off into never-never land for 30 seconds and choose a vibration of my own. As you are an observer of life, whatever you are observing dictates the vibration that you practice. As you are a creator of life, you deliberately choose what you observe in order to affect the vibration. You deliberately choose what you think in order to deliberately affect the vibration. 7/13/02 JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35 Remember the good things of the day, list of success About today I liked and enjoyed:............................................................................................... .. ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ......................

We think it would be nice if you could take money out of the equation, because ìmoneyî is a word that for most of you smacks of vibrational resistance. So if you could just avoid the concept, then you could avoid the resistance and you would allow more of the abundance that is natural. Any time you focus on anything, you vibrate with it. And what weíve noticed is that most people who focus upon the word ìmoneyî or the word ìabundanceî or the word ìfinancesî, most of them are vibrationally lackful when they are focused there. We tease that someday we think your Websterís Dictionary will define ìmoneyî as ìnot enoughî, because that is the usual feeling that we feel from most of you when you use the word. And so, if you are wanting to change that, what you are wanting to do is replace the word with a word that is less resistant in nature. Replace it with a word like ìEnergyî or make up a new word. Begin calling money ìnachosî or something like that. ìIf I can gather enough nachos, Iíll go to the ball game this weekend.î Because usually there is not so much resistance. Make up some word that you have fun with. Some word that is fulfilling to you, you see. And as you are finding a new vibration that is less resistant, the money will flow to you. Most of you are not short on wanting money, you are just tall on resisting it, and so, goosing up wanting only amplifies resistance. Sometimes we teach: ìWell, just talk about what youíll do with the money. Imagine spending it. Imagine all of things that youíll do with it.î But if youíve already developed quite a bit of resistance about money, that can be a quite an aggravating, annoying game, and most of you donít stick with it very long. Deliberately try to reduce your resistance around the word ìmoneyî, and one way of doing it is to recognize that everything is flowing to you on this Energy Stream. Weíve watched Jerry and Esther who are, and have been for many years, very comfortable with dollars. The dollars that flow to them are abundant and flow easily, and what Esther is beginning to notice is that there are many things that are of a wonderful nature that are happening in their life that donít have anything to do with dollars. The abundance flows in many more avenues than dollars. And so, if you could focus upon the gifts that the Universe gives you: When you say ìabundanceî, think about it in the abundance of health, the abundance of vitality, the abundance of clarity, the abundance of enthusiasm, the abundance of delicious people in your life, the abundance of loving letters in your life. The abundance of free- flowing traffic in your life. The abundance of wonderful experiences in your life... As you start thinking in terms of this abundance that doesnít have anything to do with dollars ó the abundance relative to the dollars starts flowing, too. Most people think that good flows to them only through the avenue of dollars. Someone will say,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37 ìWell, she lives a very good life,î and someone else will say, ìWell, of course she does, sheís rich.î as if the answer to a good life is just having more money. And we say, the answer to a good life is in not resisting a good life, because a good life is natural to you. Itís your legacy. It is your inheritance. It is flowing to all of you. And so, you just have to play those mind games with yourself, getting yourself more and more in the place of allowing the extreme abundance that is natural to you, so that you start rendezvousing with more of the good things.

There are a hundred thousand people who work at various stages and places in this corporation, and you are the one who created it. You imagined it. You saw the need for it. You dreamed it. You found vibrational harmony with your dream. And now itís yours. And there are a thousands who donít know how to use their computers, they donít know how to file very well, they are learning at different stages, itís a constant turnover of people, theyíre in and out, theyíre squabbling over parking places, some have windows, some donít. Itís an immense organization. And you have a manager that is just incredible. Because this manager takes care of all of this, you donít have to deal with anything. You get an idea, and you express it softly. And the manager says, ìConsider it done.î You get another idea and you envision it, and your manager says, ìConsider it done.î You have such an extraordinary manager that you are free. Youíre not dealing with the nitty gritty in the parking lot, not dealing with raises or vacations, youíre not worried about any of this stuff. You are the visionary. And you have a manager that deals with it effectively and perfectly. And you count your lucky stars, every day, that you found this manager. And now, weíre saying to you, you have such a manager ó and itís called Law of Attraction. But most of you do not know that you have that manager. And so, you keep thinking that you need to step into those many roles, and be the facilitator. And then you get bogged down in all that nitpicking, nitty gritty stuff that doesnít have anything to do with who you really are or with your vision. Our message to you is: You are a visionary. And of course it is lovely to be an actionary too. But if you will let your vision be real and full and you find full alignment with it before you take action ó then the effort that you offer is always joyful, fulfilling, satisfying effort. And so, keep telling the ìmanagerî what you want. Not because the manager (called Law of Attraction) needs to hear it, but because every time you talk about it, and every time you come into vibrational harmony with your own desire ó you open your vortex of allowing so that the Universe can yield to you a little bit more of what it already knows you want. You are all working much too hard at all of this. It goes like this: You are wonderful beings. You are blessed beings. You are deserving of Well-being. Well-being is on its way to you.

Whether it is a mate,a former mate, a son a friend, doesnít matter. Somebody in your experience, and they have 10 predominant characteristics. 7 of the characteristics are delightful.and 3 of these characteristics are abhorrent. And being an observer, like most humans are .You are observing all 10 of them so you are experiencing some of all 10 of them. But you for the most part appreciate the relationship, because 7 of them are won- derful, and only 3 of them are abhorrent. And so you would call it basically a good relationship. So then you decide that rather than just be an observer. You are going to be a more selective sifter of data,and you are going to use your power of imagination .And so the 3 things that are sort of abhorrent to you, you notice and you feel the negative response to them. And little by little, as we have demonstrated a bit here today, you feel the negative emotion, you identify what you would like to exclude. Then you identify what you want to include Now, earlier we said to you that the formulae for creating anything that you want is simpleÖÖ.Identify the desire and then vibrationally match it. If you cant match it through what you are observingÖÖ.and often you cantÖÖ..as in these 3 abhorrent qualities they donít match your desire. No problem! Match your desire through your imagination. So now here you are.A person who has identified desire really keenly because you have observed things you donít want which helps you to identify what you do want. So your desires out here pulsing sort of loud and very real.And much of your desire you can match just through observa- tion. Those 7 qualities, you observed those 7 qualities ÖÖyou match your desire. Three of them you canít match through observation. No problem. You donít observe those, you just imagine the other 3. So now you are vibrating purely in harmony with your desire. When that happens, you evoke from those around you that which matches your desire. And if they are really vibrationally opposed to you, they vibrate right out of your experience. Now your son is not going to do that. In other words your child will join you in that vibration. But the question pointedly put to you isÖÖ Why do you think you are getting some of those 3 things?? It is because of your attention to them we promise you. You all keep thinking that if somebodyís got a characteristic, and they are thrusting it at you. You are just a victim that has to take it, and thatís what makes you want to make them stop it. Thatís what makes you want to say ìClean up those 3 abhorrent characteristics, so that we can have a better relationshipî And the thing that we really want you to hear isÖÖIf you are having it in your experience, it is because you are vibrating it! And you are usually vibrating it through obser- vation ,but it doesnít matter. As long as you are vibrating it ,its going to stay in your experience. As soon as you clean up your vibration,your relationships will all take on that new framework too. Guest So in other words I just need to imagine what it is that I want?

Lack is really a physical thing. It doesnít exist anywhere else in the Universe. Itís only in the physical. In the same way that air flows easily and always to all physical beings, unless it is artificially disrupted or prevented, abundance flows to all. Abundance of wellness, abundance of Energy, abundance of enthusiasm, abundance of joy, abundance of all that is desired flows to you at all timesóunless it is artificially disrupted or prevented. When I am focused upon Well-being there can be no disruption or prevention. When I am focused upon joy, or love, or money or vitality, it can not be prevented. The prevention or disruption of this dynamic, eternally offered Stream of Well-Being, can be humanly prevented or artificially disrupted in only one way. By choosing thoughts of the absence of love, or Well-being, or abundance. By choosing thoughts of lack. *By the powerful Law of Attraction, it is not possible to think of abundance and disallow it at the same time. *By the powerful Law of Attraction, it is not possible to notice the lack of abundance and allow it at the same time.

Personal peace is. You canít orchestrate world peace. The only way you could ever orchestrate world peace is if you could convince everyone to want exactly the same thing. And you donít have a prayer of doing that. There is no possibility of getting everyone to agree with you, you see. So then you say, ìYes, but what if I ignore him and so I disengage him [the enemy] from my vibration.î Good word, isnít it? Iíve deactivated so Iíve disengaged him from my vibration. ìBut what about the others that heís trampling? What about those that donít know as much as I do?î And we say, now youíre back involved. In other words, you get to choose. And weíre not for a moment suggesting that getting involved is wrong. What weíre getting at here isó there are a lot of people that want purpose in life; they want reason; they want something to focus upon. In other words, the war or the causeóat what point does anyone get to decide that itís gone past nobility and patriotism and into terrorism and overtaking other countries. In other words, Itís really a fine line who gets to decide who the bad guy is and who the good guy is. And always the good guy is you and the bad guy is themóand you all think that. So finally when you say, ìI donít have to figure it out for any of them. And Iím going to align with the energy of well-being and follow that path.î Then it gets easier for you to watch everyone else play out their games. Every now and again, Esther will find herself straddling the line. She canít decide if sheís happy that the government is making effort to protect all of you or if she is worried that the government in all of its efforts are part of the cause of the problem. And then Esther discovers that thereís no right answer to that. But the answer for her is: withdraw from the thought and live happily ever after. And it is our promise to her and generations that followóYOU DO NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT ANYONE ELSE IS DOING IF YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF YOUR OWN VIBRATION. We would say that to an individual, but we could never say it to a nation. A nation is made up of too many different vibrational beings, you see. <snip> As an uplifter we hear the basis of these questions because you are a teacher to the very core of your being. And itís not any easy thing to know what you know and to live a life that is stable and good-feeling and see others around you that have not figured it out or who cannot find their way.

She came home from a trip and she was feeling very much overwhelmed. Too much to do she thought. Mailbox was overflowing, voice mail box was overflowing, and suitcases and bags were all around. Then as she sat in the muddle, she said Abraham what should I do? And we saidî there you are acting like a physical being always trying to figure out what to do!!î ìHow do you want to feel?î She said ìI want to feel free and happy, and I donít feel free and happy when I have too much to doî And we said ìThere you are acting like a physical being telling us what you donít want when we ask you what you DO want!!î She laughed and said ìI want to feel free and happyî We said ponder that for a moment. So she closed her eyes and envisioned sitting on the front porch, sipping some tea, talking to her mate, watching the squirrels and right away she felt free and happy. She said ìNow what?î We said ìNow what do you want to have?î She said, ìI want to have a clean and efficient organized home and office.î And we said - ponder that friend, do not jump right into action, wait until you are inspired. From your place of feeling good you will reach out to the inspiration that will lead you to that which you seek. And so within a couple of days, the thoughts began to come. ìI can move this over here, I can delegate this, I can eliminate this ì. Her mate noticed that she was not acting out of drudgery as she sometimes had done. But she was bounding from place to place inspired by these ideas that were coming you see... rather than trying to fix it from negative perspective which never works because Law of Attraction just attracts more negatives. She was now being inspired because she had achieved her place of balance before. You are getting it? And so the way you get away from a negative feeling is by acknowledging that it is a good thing that you have it. Donít beat up on yourself... îOh I shouldnít be feeling this wayî. Instead acknowledge how valuable it is that you have been alerted to the fact that there is something that is out of harmony. Then you CONSCIOUSLY give thought to what it is you think you would like to feel, which will inspire your ideas of what you are wanting to have which will then lead you to action. And we encourage you never to take action without that inspiration, because that action will be futile. It is action that is usually contradictory to what you are really wanting. Some say ìAbraham you teach laziness!! You teach us to lay around and wait to be inspired, what if I am never inspired?î And we say.. you can not avoid being inspired when you are in that place of positive emotion . When you get in that place of positive all good things come to you. Just as you remain in that place of negative, all bad things come to you. G 7/8/90 **************** Trying too hard IS resisting... for this reason ó think about this ó if you decide that you want to go to the grocery store and buy a quart of milk, do you ever find yourself trying too hard? Or do you just go get it? And the reason you just go get it is because you have absolute knowledge - you KNOW. You know"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 you have the ability to go, you know you have the money in your purse, you know the milk will be there when you get there. In other words, there is no doubt and so there is no trying against anything. And so whenever youíre trying too hard, what is happening is there is a part of you that is not believing that it can be and so in your wanting to compensate with action, you offer more action. And what we are wanting you to understand is that you cannot act enough. There is not enough action in the world to compensate for your taking part of the energy and sending it in the other direction in the form of negative emotion. If youíve got negative emotion about something, youíre stuck there and no action is going to change it. The only thing thatís going to change it is by releasing the thought which is bringing forth the negative emotion, replacing it with a thought that brings positive emotion and then the action will come JOYFULLY you see. G-8/22/90 **************** Thatís what the ìMastersî do. Everyone who has a great idea about anything ó they have focused upon what they wanted long enough, and by the Law of Attraction their thought got big enough and broad enough and bold enough that they made connection with their Inner Being. And then their Inner Being transmitted their desire to the boundaries of the Universe ó and you have no limitation under those conditions. 7/4/91 *************** Jerry: How do we get the things we want to be perfect. Do we have to just keep at everything all the time? Abe: You do not. Once you reach the place that you are accepting it, as it is. In other words it is your attention to lack that causes the negative creation. And so in the moment that you are no longer giving your attention to lack, you have it made! That is all. In other words, once you acknowledge wellness as the natural state, and you release your guardedness of illness. Wellness will be your experience. Once you accept abundance as you natural state of being, and you stop resisting not having enough money Abundance is your natural state of being. Once you have accepted harmony within a relationship as the natural state of being and you stop focussing on the lack, harmony will be your natural state of being. And so the answer is ìNoî, you do not have to continually keep hammering away at what you do want. But it is important for you to no longer think about what you are not wanting. G-9/22/91 **************** Your Inner Being is aware of where you stand and what you want and where you stand relative to what you want. Your Inner Being knows how close or how far you are, vibrationally and time wise from all things. Your Inner Being is also knowing what is in your heart and what is in your mind and what is in your vibration. At any point in time, your Inner Being knows exactly the action or thought or word that would be appropriate for you.

To be the perfect mate, you make your partner feel good. You do this by looking for the positive aspects in each other. You think you want to be loved, but what you want is the feeling of love coming out of you. When the other evokes that from you, that is why you feel loved. You are wanting to interact with someone because you are wanting the feeling of love to be evoked from you, and you are wanting a subject, or a target upon which to direct your love. You are wanting the glorious deliciousness of the physical experience. You are wanting someone who is a friend, someone to respond, someone who seeks adventure, someone who wants to laugh at the things you are wanting to laugh at. You have launched long before today a very powerful creation. Keep your eyes open for it, and stop being so guarded about it. Exaggerate, add emphasis, talk to yourself everyday about what you are wanting. As you get up in the morning and beat on your chest, say to yourself ìToday I am going to see evidence of the coming of my perfect mate. Today I am going to look under every rock, around every corner, I am going to keep my eyes open for that perfect mate. Today I am going to find, or at least get closer to that perfect mate.î Then you have awakened your guidance system! You have stated what you want. Your guidance system is aware. You walk into a room full of people, you feel yourself inspired to go and talk to that one, and you say ìNot that one, that one doesnít look the way I want.î And now you are right back into the arena of lack. That one may lead you to one who will lead you to one who will lead you to one who will lead you to one. You cannot see the path that is before you. If you will follow the positive emotion, you will very swiftly be drawn to them. You see, that other one is out there looking for you! He is saying where is she, and you are saying where is he, and we are saying we will not play cupid. Law of attraction does a very good job of that. As each of you focuses on what you are wanting, the connection must be. Mating is the same as co-creating. Co-creating is the same as soul creating. Identify what you want, pay attention to what you feel, and you will be guided to that which you seek. Look for the positive aspects in every one you see. As you see in another a quality that you donít want, and you say ìNot that one, not that one.î You are closing a door that is keeping all from coming because a critical attitude about them is keeping all of them away from you. As you begin to say ìPositive aspect there, positive aspect thereî you attract to you the one that has all of those positive aspects. In your pickiness, be a selective sifter, look for what you are wanting, donít guard yourself against what you are not wanting. Never make the statement ìI donít want that one, I donít like that one.î Make statements such as ìOoh, that is a nice one, ooh, I like the attitude there, that one is very beautiful.î As you focus on positive aspects of others, even if they are already connected to an- other, look for the positive aspects, and by doing that you attract that into your experience. Your mate is very near you. We are talking in terms of time. Be expectant."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74 JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ Smile for one Minute - this increases the seratonin levels in your ssystem and is a powerful antidepressant.

You have the ability to come into alignment again and again and again, and if anyone in the Universe understands that, itís the cells of your body.

After all, we are only giving you a whole new orientation for life.î And what that whole new orientation is ìfeel your way through it, donít think your way through it. Think and feel, think and feel, think and feel, think and feel, but be guided by the way you feel.î If it doesnít feel good, it isnít good. If it doesnít feel good, itís full of resistance. Resistance is whatís killing you. Resistance is what is making you sick. Resistance is what is slowing you down. Resistance is the only culprit in your physical experience. Extract from Abraham-Hicks Jan/Feb/Mar 1996 newsletter óóóóó- There is one constant steady Stream of pure positive Energy flowing to you at all times, and in any moment, you, as an individual, are allowing or resisting that Stream. When youíre allowing the Stream, you feel wonderful, you feel clarity, you feel vitality, you feel health, you feel abundance. You feel good. But if you are not allowing the Stream, you donít feel so good. Thatís what blame or doubt or fear is about. Extract from Abraham_Hicks Apr/May/Jun 1996 newsletter óóóó- These three things are always true of resistance: Resistance is the only thing that keeps you from your natural Well-being. Negative emotion is always present as your indicator of resistance. And resistance always, always, always means you are pushing against something. Extract from Abraham_Hicks Apr/May/Jun 1996 newsletter A man said to us, ìAbraham, I have cancer and they tell me I have only a few weeks, maybe a few days, to live. But Iím going to beat it.î And we said, ìWell, you see, you cannot. As long as it is the object of your attention, as long as you are looking at cancer and saying, `Iím going to beat it,í you are achieving a stance of resistance. You are achieving vibrational harmony with the cancer ó and, therefore, you are resisting the Stream.î Extract from Abraham_Hicks Apr/May/Jun 1996 newsletter There are thoughts that feel perfectly normal to you that are full of resistance, and you keep getting entrapped in them, because they feel so normal, because you and everybody else has been thinking them for so long. Thoughts like, the economy is struggling, or thoughts like, there isnít enough to go around, or thoughts like, you have to work hard to succeed, or thoughts like, Iím inappropriate in some way or I am not capable in some way, or thoughts like, I shouldnít do that. There are all kinds of thoughts that you wrestle with that are vibrationally not in harmony with your broader knowing. Extract from Abraham_Hicks Apr/May/Jun 1996 newsletter .....really, by all physical standards, she was right. Wasnít she? In other words, it is inappropriate"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 to say you are going to be there and not be there, isnít it? She wasnít wrong, was she? She was ìrightî in her resistance.

The very Source of life, the Source that keeps my blood pumping, the Source that keeps my cells working, the Source of Well-being, the Source that keeps the planet spinning in its orbit... Iíve got myself cut off because the gardener did not show up. And we think that if you stop in the midst of any negative emotion and ask yourself, ìIs this worth giving up Life Force?î that in every case the answer would be no. Extract from Abraham_Hicks Apr/May/Jun 1996 newsletter óóóóó- ...why arenít more people utilizing their Guidance System to hold themselves more often in a state of allowing the things that they want? Because you have become accustomed to the feeling of resistance, so much so that your Guidance System is sort of numb. It feels normal for many of you to feel a little ornery, or a little aggravated. In other words, you have become so accustomed to the feeling of resistance that you donít understand the Guidance System when it is there within you. Extract from Abraham-Hicks Oct/Nov/Dec 2000 newsletter We want to make 3 powerful statements to you, and if these are the only 3 things you ever hear.They will be enough Number One The ONLY problem, the ONLY thing that causes you any trouble. The only thing that slows you down.The only thing that keeps you from what you want. The only thing that makes you sick is RESISTANCE Number Two Resistance is always accompanied by negative emotion.

That is the flow that youíre talking about. That is life of ecstasy; that is a life that flows; that is a life of doors opening everywhere; that is a life of being able to do what you could not otherwise have done if you were ten people, one hundred people, one thousand people. G 10/3/92 ***************** You see, the day that Esther laid in her bed and launched the intention to be in the first class seats, there were MANY ëco-creatorsí involved. The people at the airport, the people on the airplane, the flight attendant, the person in the other city who took an earlier flight and left an- other seat open. In other words, there were 100s of other co-creators involved in that scenario that Jerry and Esther never did see. In other words, they could not physically, in an action sense, see it. So, when you are talking about co-creating, realize that this co-creation is not just you and your co-creating partner. It is you and a whole host of physical and nonphysical beings. 11/1/92 ***************** When you believe that it is through your effort that you make it happen, and you apply effort and you get tired, then you disconnect from what really makes it happen. G 2/28/93 ***************** When we talk about molding Energy, what weíre really talking about is getting out there and thinking. Think, and feel how that thought feels. Think. Use your Guidance System. Donít come to a seminar and try to get somebody to tell you what to do, donít go to books or dig up books that have been buried 2,000 years ago and try to figure out how to live your life. Get out there and live, and any moment that youíre off the track youíll feel it. Every moment that you have stepped away from the Energy, youíll feel it. So what you begin to notice is that there is a pattern: When you are appreciating, youíre full of this Energy; when youíre blaming, itís not there. When you are applauding and finding value and seeing positive aspects, it is pouring through you. If youíre finding lack and finding fault and seeing criticism, itís not there. So, as you begin to just think and feel, think and feel, you can teach yourself, in a matter of a few days, how to get back into connection with that Energy. Every- bodyís running around trying to find somebody to love them, when what all of you really want, is an object of attention that pulls pure Energy through you. 1/23/94 ***************** Unless you are able to bring yourself to a place of feeling good about it, donít take action. So what are we concluding here? Your work is to first find the feeling place, then take the inspired action. So are we trying to guide you away from action? Not at all. Action is delicious. Act as much as you have physical time, energy, and inclination to act. But always take your point of action from a place of feeling good. 3/12/94"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85 JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ Smile for one Minute - this increases the seratonin levels in your system and is a powerful antidepressant.

Itís like, ìWell Iím only responding to what sheís taught me.î And this is the thing that we want so much for you all to hear from us here today: You teach each other your respective responsive vibrations. In other words, you donít feel any way about anyone without their helping you to feel that way. Itís really co-creation. Weíll even go further, and bolder, and louder, and blunter. If thereís somebody you donít like, they donít like you either! We have never seen it otherwise. We have never one time, ever, known someone to adore some- one... that the one that they were adoring, didnít adore them back! Now, some are thinking.. ìOh wait a minute. There was that man that I loved with all my heart, and he didnít love me back.î And we say, you were offering him insecurity. You were offering him worry. It wasnít that pure vibration of love. When you are tuned in, tapped in, turned on ó when you are connected to your Source and holding someone as your object of attention and you are genuinely offering that feeling of love and appreciation ó they canít offer you anything else! The law of attraction, that manager called law of attraction would not put you together... even when you live in the same house. You would rendezvous differently. You would come home when sheís not there; sheíd come home when youíre not there. Or she would be unavailable or sheíd be doing something else. You would really have to work hard to seek out those incompatible moments, when you are in that place of pure positive energy. It just could not happen, you see. So.

The basic nature of your beings is much more harmonious than it is unharmonious. Your wars and your disagreements come about because you do not look at those things that are harmonious; you look at the things that are not. And since you are not able to change those things, for you cannot create in the life experience of another, you cause yourself great distress, and you bring much negative experience into your life as you give your attention to those things that cause you negative emotion. Abraham Calendar Allow Others To Be As They Are As you understand that your primary intentions are harmony and growth and that the primary intentions of those who surround you are the same, and as you recognize that even in your differences you are each intending to have life experience that will bring you knowing, then, perhaps, you will be more willing to allow the others to be as they are, as you expect them to allow you to be as you are.

Period!!!. Physical beings seem to think that there are two streams,a good one and a bad one They spend their life pushing against the bad one, and thatís what resistance is. Thatís what causes you to dis- allow the wellbeing that is flowing to you always you see. Extract from AbrahamóHicks tape G-4.8.95 ...îThe Energy that created your planet, to begin with, flows forth constantly. Some call it God force. We call it Creative Life Force. It is the stuff that all things come from. It flows forth to you in one constant, steady Stream. There are not two streams, one of wellness and one of illness. Or one of abundance and one of poverty. There is one Stream. In the same way that there is not a stream of light and a stream of dark the darkness is just the absence of the light the illness is the absence of the wellness, The poverty is the absence of the abundance. This Stream of Well-being comes to you. Now you can let it in or not. But thereís one Stream and itís coming to you. So if you are living something less than a vital, exuberant, abundant life it is not because you have chosen a different path, it is because you are resisting the path you have chosen.

So we are going to give you a sort of rough sketchy but very valid picture of how this works. Have you ever played with an electrical train set, where there were lots of components to it? As you pushed your switches it sent an electrical current through the tracks which allowed the train to run As you flipped your switches, the current would go from track to track. so that the train would follow the direction of your guidance. This is similar Ö.it is rough and sketchyÖÖ but as you flow your energy towards something you literally send energy to the tracks upon which circumstances and events will run in order to help you achieve your outcome The other night when Estherís luggage had not arrived and she is lying in her bed stewing!!. For a little while she was offering blame to the airline. They had only allowed a 45 minute connection in Newark, to transfer from one airline to another airline, and the airlines were not even in the same terminal building. So Jerry and Esther barely made it running from one plane to the other, and their baggage did not make it. When AirCanada did not have their baggage and they looked at their ticket they said, ìWell there was not enough time for this baggage to be transferred. We need at least 1hour and 15 minutes to do thatî So now Esther is feeling blame towards the booking agent for not knowing that. She is blaming the airline, she is blaming the booking agent, she is blaming the people for not being efficient. But what is really happening is. In all Estherís blaming, she has got her circuits turned to a place where nothing is aligned. So if you were watching an arial view, you would see one truck arrive with Jerry and Estherís baggage just as the truck that needed it was leaving. You would see one man coming to look for the baggage tags and leaving right out the door just as the luggage came back into the room !! In other words millions of near misses happening because Esther was flowing her energy in a way that was not aligning circumstances and events. In the moment that Esther started feeling appreciation for all of those people that were out there in the middle of the night working to find ÖÖ. It was like all of the energy went back into sequence, and instead of near misses, now things were starting to fall into place. A person received a call who had just seen the bags. And he was able to call and stop the ÖÖ.you see what we are getting at? The entire Universe is responding to you based upon the way you are flowing your energy. And NOTHING is affecting your experience other than the way you are spewing your energy. It is not someone else, it is not outside circumstances, it is nothing but the way you are flowing your energy. Extract from Abraham-Hicks tape G-7/24/93.

[Audience laughs.] In other words, most of you are having a difficult time finding anything to eat, thereís something wrong with all of it, according to some book somewhere. And so you have this desire for this physical [countenance], and the reality is something different than your desire. And your reality is so obvious to you... itís obvious to you when you pass a mirror, itís obvious to you when someone that you care about looks at you, itís obvious to you by the way your cloths feel. How you are is obvious to you. In fact, how you are is dominant in your vibration. îSo you envision a brief run on a beach, dressed in something very scanty and revealing, whether you are male or female, jogging down the beach, knowing you look good, feeling great that you look good, knowing that they know you look good. Scene is over. îIn other words, you must go that long . . . or you remember being dressed in something that you felt really good in, and you remember somebody else who you didnít even know, meeting you in an elevator and saying, ìyou are really beautiful in that.î Scene is over. îYou get a sense of it? In other words, you must find a little snatch... revel in it for a moment and leave. And what happens is you begin to activate that part of you so much, that now even though a reality is different from what you are living, you have different things activated within you, so everything starts responding to you according to your different activation. îWhen you feel fat your food makes you fatter ñ it does! When you feel slender your food keeps you slender ñ it does! You must understand that because you see people eating similarly with very different results, and you say, ìoh yeah, itís their metabolism,î and we say, what do you think metabolism is?! Metabolism is vibrational response to your moment in time. Metabolism is the way the energy is moving through your body, you see. And so *everything* is in response to the way that you feel. Everything is. Everything is mind over matter.î ~ Abraham ñ 5/11/02 MD JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"113 Remember the good things of the day, list of success About today I liked and enjoyed:............................................................................................... .. ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ...................... ............................................................................................................................... ......................

By acknowledging leverage. Imagine a big heavy box. You want to pick it up. So instead of trying to pick it up, you take a pole and a fulcrum and you stick it under and then you push on the other end of the pole. Leverage. Use the leverage of the Energy that creates worlds... When you get into the flow with the Energy that creates worlds, you will have leverage beyond your wildest dreams. Seventeen seconds of focus that is not contradicted is equivalent to over 2,000 action hours. Only twice that ó 34 seconds of non contradicted thought ó is equivalent to 20,000 action hours. Add another 17 seconds to it and you can multiply by ten again. 68 seconds of non contradicted thought is equivalent to more action hours than you could work in ten life times. Esther said, ìWhy donít I know that? If I have access to this kind of leverage, why donít I know that?î And we said: You rarely hold yourselves on a subject for 17 seconds, long enough to allow that thought to combust into a more specific, and therefore more powerful, thought. ìYou are like most people,î we said to Esther. ìYou are so caught up in the reality of what you are living, that the vibration that you offer is mostly only about what you are living.î So whenever you say, ìI donít have enough time,î thatís the vibration that you offer, and you donít have access to exercises or thoughts or ideas or people that you could delegate to. You donít have access to the way the world works without so much action. Havenít you been mystified when you see people who seem to not work very hard at all that have so much wonderful stuff coming to them? And then, you see those that are working the hardest ó and they seem to be getting the least. Havenít you ever wondered what was wrong with that? They just havenít learned the leverage of aligning Energy. They are going about it the hard way. They are trying to use their action to create ó rather than their alignment of Energy. - Abraham, Excerpted from Workshop at Tarrytown, NY ó G-10/18/98 JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"115 Smile for one Minute - this increases the seratonin levels in your system and is a powerful antidepressant.

So as you are moving through your day and you notice that you have more desire or need for money then you actually have money and a big bill has come so you have this conflicting feeling where you want to spend it for this but you should spend it for this and even if you do pay it where it belongs there is not enough to really go around in the way you are wanting to. And in this frustrating moment of weighing the pros and cons of your experience, you fire off a rocket of desire big time. Youíve asked in a very powerful way but the answer, even though its given, is not received because you are more aware of not having enough money then you are of having enough money. In your anxiety you are not in the receiving mode, in your anger or blame or guilt you are not in the receiving mode. In your awareness of not enough money you are not in the receiving mode for enough money so more money cannot come, not right now, nothing can change. Now, youíve asked, Source Energy hears you clearly, adores you fully, understands your worthiness entirely, and answers swiftly. So the answer is not just on the way, it is given. In other words, everything is lined up; the money SHOULD be there NOW. Why isnít! Because youíre ornery. (laughter) Youíre worried, youíre frustrated. Youíve got your receiver set to a whole different channel.

I fathered a child in another part of the world A: And then that child is blessed as you have been blessed. G: Ahhhaaa.

Understanding that while guidance can be beneficial, that guidance is always coming from broader perspective. And that Well Being is the order of things... And so weíre just using your example to sort of balance things out just a little bit. Thereís no right or wrong behavior. Weíre not saying itís wrong for a father to leave, or itís wrong for a father to stay. Or itís right to live in this way - wrong to live in that way. What we are saying is, you canít get it wrong. And your father didnít get it wrong. And you didnít get it wrong. And anybody whoís decided to make that wrong, is just using that as their temporary excuse to not allow themselves to have all of the riches that this environment is offering to them otherwise, you see. You can use anything you want as your excuse to not allow Well Being in. And it is amazing how flimsy some of these excuses are. And, on your world stage, many would say, ìAbraham, this is far from a flimsy excuse.î ... We would focus in the more poignant now. We would make our relationship with our source G: Oh. All right. A: about things that you understand fully G: Yes, yes. A: and not nebulous things you are perceiving together. Since your father is not unhappy or unhealthy; since there is nothing that can be gained by going back and re-tracing it, then we just do not encourage it. We encourage you instead to find something that is tangible in your NOW. And use that, to activate your vibration and connect to your Source Energy as a result of something that is more current. Something that is pure. Something that has the potential of giving you more. It is exactly the reason that we think these virtual realities are so lovely, and delicious, and life giving, and helpful. In other words, we would rather you get into a pure fantasy - than face any kind of factual reality, if the factural reality has the potential of taking you into a place that does not feel good...

I can see that my now is colored by all of these things. And itís difficult for me not to constantly remind myself that I missed out on this or that. Abe: Well, that is logical, isnít it? Because thatís where your vibration is, itís logical that you would be reminded of things like that. We have a fun way of looking at it: Letís say you have a piece of very fine sandpaper, and you rub it with your fingers. It is so fine that at first it feels almost like velvet. So you rub it a little more, and a little more, and a little more. In the beginning, there is no detriment to this experience. But the longer you rub it, the more unpleasant it becomes. Your skin is beginning to feel some sensitivity ó and after an hour or two, maybe even some beginnings of blisters. Yet sometimes that sandpaper is really the only thing visible in the room. And even though the experience is not very pleasant, youíve got this habit going. Then, all of a sudden, you realize ìHey, I donít have to do this!î And you simply lift your fingers up off the sandpaper! This is a deliberate intent to remove yourself from this irritation. The sensation of lifting up is wonderful. As you lift off, it almost feels like spider webs pulling from your fingers. We want you to begin reaching for that ensuing sense of relief. Youíve had your eye on this sandpaper. It seemed justified, it seemed important. People talked to you about it, thereís evidence of it in your life, and everything seems to be somehow about sandpaper. But in reality, there is it and there is the absence of it, and you do have a choice of whether or not to lift your fingers ó your thoughts, that is ó off of what is evoking this unpleasant experience. Begin to take pleasure in feeling relief from it. Have you ever been in the middle of a negative conversation when someone tried to change the subject to something that felt positive? You didnít necessarily want them to change the subject ó you had some good juices flowing about that topic. But they persevered, because they had decided they were going to lift away from it. And so you went with them in the different conversation, and stayed there for a moment. Then you, too, began to feel relief. We want you to get hooked on asking, ìWhich thought feels better?î Let the feeling of relief become what is most important to you. We want you to say, ìI am practicing the art of letting in Well-being. The art of keeping out, or the art of resistance ó that may be the art of ërealityí that Iíve always practiced. That may be the way"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"141 my mother does it and my sister does it, and the way that everybody that I know does it. Keeping it out may be the art theyíre all practicing ó but Iím practicing the art of letting it in. Iím lifting off of my discomfort and, in so doing, letting fresh energy flow into my experience.î When we talk about Deliberate Creation, we can feel some of you thinking, ìI must constantly hold my thoughts rigidly in better places.î And we hear you dictating to one another, chastising one another: ìNow, you know thatís not what Abraham teaches.î And we say, ìAnd *thatís* not what Abraham teaches, either!î (Abraham smiles) We encourage the art of Allowing ó the art of letting it in. The tricky thing is that sometimes, even though this sandpaper is not pleasant and can get really unpleasant, the key is in developing a more sensitive awareness. We donít know many of you who would rub your hand until it is bloody. Yet thatís the way you tend to handle some not-good-feeling subjects. You rub yourself all over them until you have so severely disallowed Well-being that negativity begins showing up in your life experience in different ways. We want to get your attention by saying that no matter how bad that reality was and no matter how justified it may seem to be, none of it needs to have anything to do with your now. The only question we want to ask ó and the only question we ever want you to try to answer, ever again ó is, ìAm I letting in Well-being right now? Does this thought let it in? Does this memory let it in? Does this statement let it in? Does this discussion let it in? Does this fantasy let it in? Am I letting it in?î When you begin to focus upon this ìlifting off,î you discover a whole lot of things you habitually think about, that are not letting it in. And as you start playing with this, youíll start having fun with it. Perhaps youíll make a button or a bumper sticker: ìAre you letting it in?î Are you letting what in? Are you letting in the Well-being that would be there if you werenít letting it in? Are you letting it in? ìWell,î you ask, ìhow do I know if Iím letting Well-being in?î If you are letting it in, then right now you feel great ó you feel appreciation or love. If youíre letting it in you will feel good ó but if youíre not letting it in, you wonít feel good. Nothing else has any bearing. Well-being has to be important enough that you let it in. So you say, ìAbraham, when I reflect back, 99% of my life doesnít let it in.î Well, we say, then donít think about that. How can you not think about 99% of your life? Selectively sift your way through it. If you look back with enough intent, you can find something ó within every aspect of every part of it ó that would let it in. -ñ Abe from the April-June 2001 Abe-Hicks newsletter JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142 Smile for one Minute - this increases the seratonin levels in your system and is a powerful antidepressant.

Donít beat up on yourself about procrastination, for this reason.

But if you are not really clear about what you want. Or if your expectation is not quite yet in alignment then it takes more action. But even in offering the action it is counter productive because you are working against yourself. In other words you are splitting the energy. You are following? So procrastination is nothing more than your physical realisation that you are acting too soon., that some mental alignment is in order. Or that the fire isnít there yet so donít spray the hose in the house!

It is the way to bring your self from a place of procrastination ÖÖwhich isnít a bad thing!!. Procrastination is not a bad thing!!

Esther nearly stopped the car on the bridge to savor it. She said, ìHave you ever seen anything so beautiful?î She said, ìIím going to remember this always, always, always.î In that moment, as she found something to appreciate, she was in the utter state of allowing, so that every desire that she had ever uttered, vibrationally or verbally, was being allowed fully, in this moment. She did not have to think about the building projects. She did not have to think about the computer projects. She did not have to think about the CD projects. She did not have to think about the book projects. She did not have to think about the water garden project. She did not have to think about the new grandbaby on the way.

So much so that, even the fish in the ocean feels preference. Even a cell in your body feels preference. In other words, ìthis feels better than this.î I prefer this to this, prefer this to this. And this extraordinary universe that we are all a part of says that when the preference of the individual preferrer or the individual consciousness is discovered, Source Energy answers it. So every preference is... how wonderful is that!? That would be like saying to you, in a much more bulky version: So here are all of these people here in this room and Source Energy is responding to every single one of you at all times. And you say ìWell that sounds pretty good. But what if one wants it to be 80 degrees in this room and another wants it to be 65 degrees in this room? How does Source Energy answer both preferences?î And we say, both preferences are answered; the individual must be in the place of allowing it. And you say ìWell how can we share the same space and time, and have two different experiences?î And we say it has to do with your willingness to allow. The reason that one wants 80 degrees and the other wants 65 degrees is because both want to be comfortable. If this one is wanting to be comfortable and not disallowing it and this (one) is wanting to be comfortable and not disallowing it, both are comfort(able)....but if this one says ìI donít like what this one is asking forî, then this one is not a match to what they want and if this one says ìI donít like what that one is asking for.î, then this one is not a match to what he wants.... so now you have two beings neither one in vibrational harmony with their own desire both blaming each other for things going wrong, you see. So, is it possible for every consciousness in all of the universe to conclude their own individual preference and all be answered? YES! EVERY asking is answered.

And as you notice it more, you offer even more vibration about it and LOA brings you even more to match it, and then you offer more vibration.

Usually, when you feel negative emotion, you feel wrongdoing in that moment. And weíve never wanted to imply that to you. In other words, we didnít, really. You just picked it up because youíre used to beating up on yourself. And because your physical training teaches you more clearly to know what you donít want than what you do want. What we are wanting you to realize is that negative emotion is a wonderful thing, because negative emotion is part of that guidance system that shows you how you are flowing energy. So, next time you feel negative emotion, rather than saying, ìAgh, shame on me. Here Iím doing it again. I keep doing it. I keep doing this dumb thing.î Instead of beating up on yourself, instead feel appreciation for your AWARENESS that you are feeling negative emotion. ìAh, my guidance system is working. I can feel that Iím flowing my energy in the opposite direction of some- thing I want.î Whether it is a flurry or a ruckus youíre having with your child; or whether it is an animal that you donít understand; or whether it is boys that donít behave; or whether it is a mate that doesnít appreciate you; whether itís not having enough money; or whether itís having a body that doesnít cooperate; or whether itís having a dog that is biting you. It doesnít matter what the negative experi- ence that you are having in the moment IS. The only thing that matters is that out of it is coming a keener awareness of what you are wanting. And as you let that negative experience serve as a catalyst to help you identify what you DO want, and then you gently talk about why you want it, and envision that it has already happened, or talk about, describe what it would be like to be there, or tell others how wonderful it would be, or remember a time when you were more there, you will feel the negative emotion go away in that moment. And the negative emotions go awayó in that moment your energy has shifted. And your new point of attraction has begun. Everything is about the way you are flowing en- ergy. Everything is about what you are attracting. And you now know where you are in every moment. So, if we were standing in your physical shoes, this is the way we would approach our physical life from this point forward. We would make more decisions in every day about what we are wanting. Because, as you make more decisions, you alert all of the universe to you. The entire universe becomes aware that you want this thing. And every resource that you have which includes everyone and every thing in the universe begins to focus upon you relative to that desire. You donít have to tell themójust let it be known yourself. And as you are then now knowing what you are wanting, your guidance system kicks in in a supreme manner. Your guidance"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"172 system is now letting you know in every moment where you stand vibrationally relative to this new decision that you have made. So that if you begin to diverge in terms of thought, word, or action, from this new decision that you have just made you will receive a negative warning bell that lets you know-you said you want this but youíre vibrating this. Wanna make a new decision? You said you wanted this, just this morning in your affirmation. We heard you say you want this, but right now youíre thinking, vibrating, feeling this way. Wanna make a new decision? Yeah, I think I will. I can feel that Iím flowing my energy in opposition to what Iím wanting. What is it that Iím wanting? Then make your statement of desire again. Speak it again. Talk about why you want it. FEEL the energy come right back into place with you. Oh, friends, it is so exciting once you begin to feel the deliberateness of flow- ing energy. You think itís fun to be strong enough that you can pick a lot of things up and move them around. WAIT UNTIL YOU CAN FEEL THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE FLOW- ING WITH YOUR DESIRE. There is nothing more exhilarating than to be physically focused in an environ- ment with so many other participants. There is so much data, so much information, so much movement, so much stuff, so much mass that you have ability to move with the power of your thought and energy flow-there is not an arena anywhere in the universe that a creator takes greater delight in than right here and now where you are. It is like a playshop beyond description. SO when you feel negative emotion, it doesnít mean anything other than right now Iíve just picked up the wrong tool. In other words, itís sort of like picking up the screwdriver that has the little straight edge instead of the little star edge. In other words, it doesnít mean anything! Donít be so hard on yourself. This is not a big thing. This is a process of sort of see sawing yourself forward into ecstasy and into joy and into contentment and into growth. There is no right answer, there is no ONE right answer. There are MILLIONS of right answers. And the fun is in putting the answers together that work best, you see. Youíre getting the sense of all of this? You canít do it wrong, you canít mess it up. You can disconnect from clarity, but SO WHAT? Itís only momentary.

There will come a time when you will be like your inner being is now-you will look back on even those most miserable of experiences that you have lived, and you will be able to see only the value in them. There will be a time when you wonít be wanting to talk about any of the things that hurt you at the time they were happening, because as you regurgitate them in the here and now you will feel them hurting you again. But instead, from those memories, that little twinge of something that hurt, you will remember something much greater, you will remember the conclusion that you drew out of it. You will remember the new decision that you made from it, and you will remember the stronger effort that you made to flow your energy toward that new decision. You will remember your successes. Do you know that when you die, when you re-emerge into nonphysical (there is not death, you know that) but when you re-emerge into nonphysical, and you look back on your experience, itís only the parties, itís only the ecstasies, itís only the high times that you remember? Those are the only times you will have access to. You only are able to acknowledge the triumphs of your physical experience. So we cannot imagine why, as you are physically focused, that you would spend any time doing anything other than that. Have fun with all of this. There is great love here for you. We are complete.
