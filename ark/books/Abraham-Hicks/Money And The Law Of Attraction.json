Why do you suppose you’re reading these words? Which part of the title got your attention? Was it Money? Health? Happiness? Learning to Attract? Or was it the Law of Attraction perhaps? Whatever the obvious reason may have been for your attention to this book, the information contained here has come to you in answer to something for which you have been somehow asking. What is this book about? It teaches that life is supposed to feel good and that our overall Well- Being is what is natural. It teaches that no matter how good your life is now, it can always get better, and that the choice and the power to improve your life experience is within your personal control. And it offers practical philosophical tools that—when put into consistent use—will enable you to allow yourself to experience more of the wealth, health, and happiness that is your natural birthright. (And I know, because it keeps happening to me. As I move forward from each desire- clarifying experience of contrast to a new desire and then to a new manifestation —my life overall gets better and better.) Life is good! It is New Year’s Day of 2008, and I’m beginning this Preface while seated at the dining-room table of our new Del Mar, California, “haven.” From the time Esther and I were married (1980), we’ve been making it a point to visit this “Garden of Eden” area as often as has been practical. And now, after all those years as appreciative San Diego visitors, we will be actually living here as appreciative part-time residents. And what’s not to appreciate? There was our friend who led us to fnd the property. (We told him we were looking for a piece of property near Del Mar where we could park our 45-foot tour bus.) There were the landscape architects, engineers, designers, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, tile roofers, and copper gut-terers. There were those talented, skilled tradespeople: tile layers; stuccoers; painters; and fence, gate, and ironworks creators. There were foor installers and custom-lift, slide-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13 doors, arched-wooden-windows-and-doors, and stained-glass-window folks. There were the “high end” high-tech people who installed the Lutron master-controlled lighting system, the audio/video/computer networking system, the new Trane multiple-zone master-controlled (silent) air-conditioning system, and the Snaidero/Miele/Bosch/Viking kitchen and laundry equipment. There were those who placed our new furniture, and placed it again, and again—as we discovered what felt best. There were those teams of hardworking diggers, trenchers, haulers, cement pourers, stoneworkers, and transplanters of full-grown trees. . . . And then there were the thousands of people who had a hand in—and also earned money from—the invention, creation, and distribution of the thousands of products involved. . . . Well, that’s a lot to appreciate. And that was just the tip of the iceberg of what’s to appreciate. There was the discovery of a new “favorite” restaurant—and owners and staff—only a couple of minutes away, and then there were those incredibly delightful eclectic, positive neighbors who welcomed us here in a style that we have never previously experienced. There’s more, too. There’s the breathtaking view to the south into the primitive Torrey Pines State Reserve, across the Carmel Valley Creek and waterbird sanctuary and the lagoon, and down into the crashing, foaming waves of the Pacifc Ocean as it untiringly washes up onto Torrey Pines Beach. Yes. Life is good! (Esther and I just fnished a brief walk on the beach, and we’re now settling down for the evening to put some fnishing touches on Abraham’s newest book— Money, and the Law of Attraction: Learn- ing to Attract Wealth, Health, and Happiness. ) It was over 40 years ago, while performing a series of concerts in colleges across the nation, that I “accidentally” noticed a book lying on a coffee table in a motel in a small town in Montana. That book, Napoleon Hill’s Think and Grow Rich, changed my beliefs about money so dramatically that my use of its principles attracted fnancial success to me in a way I hadn’t previously imagined. Thinking or growing rich hadn’t been something I had much interest in. But shortly before discovering that book, I had decided that I wanted to modify the way I earned money—and increase the amount I received. And so, it turned out that my attraction to Hill’s book was a direct answer to what I had been “asking” for. Soon after encountering Think and Grow Rich in that Montana motel, I met a man in a motel in Minnesota who offered me a business opportunity that was so compatible with Hill’s teachings that for nine joyous years I focused my attention on building that business. During those nine years, the business grew into a multimillion-dollar international enterprise. And in that relat ively short time, my fnances grew from just getting by (which was all I’d previously really wanted) to reaching all of my newly inspired fnancial goals."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14 What I learned from Hill’s book worked so grandly for me that I began using that work as a “textbook” to share his success principles with my business associates. But, looking back, even though the teachings had worked extremely well for me, I became aware that only a couple of my associates had received the huge fnancial success that I had wanted all of them to have. And so, I began to search for another level of answers that might be more effective for a broader range of people. As a result of my personal Think and Grow Rich experience, I became convinced that the achievement of success was something that could be learned. We didn’t have to be born into a family who had already discovered how to make money. We didn’t have to get good grades in school or know the right people or live in the right country or be the right size, color, gender, religion, and so on. . . . We simply had to learn a few simple principles and then consistently put them into practice. However, not everyone gets the same message from the same words—or the same results from the same books. And so, as soon as I began “asking” for more understanding, Richard Bach’s enlight- ening book Illusions happened to come into my awareness. And although Illusions brought me to one of the most thrilling “Aha!” days of my life and brought some concepts that began to open my mind for the phenomenon that I was about to experience, it contained no additional principles that I could consciously utilize in my business. The next “accidental” discovery of an ultimately valuable book for me came while I was just killing some time in a Phoenix library. I wasn’t “looking for” anything, but I happened to notice a book, high on a shelf, entitled Seth Speaks, by Jane Roberts and Robert F. Butts. Seth, “a Non-Physical Entity,” had “dictated” through Jane a series of books, and I read them all. And as strange as that form of communication may have seemed to most (Esther was extremely uncomfortable with it at frst), I had always tended to judge the trees by their fruits. And so, I looked beyond the “strange” aspects and focused on what to me were the positive, practical parts of the Seth material that I felt I could utilize to help others improve their life experience. Seth had a different perspective on life than what I had heard previously expressed, and I was particularly interested in two of Seth’s terms: “You Create Your Own Reality” and “Your Point of Power Is in the Present.” Although as much as I read, I never felt that I truly understood those principles, I somehow knew that there were, within them, answers to my questions. However, Jane was no longer in physical form, so “Seth” was unavailable for any further clarifcation. Through a series of fortuitous events—in a manner similar to the Seth-and-Jane experiences— Esther, my wife, began receiving the material that is now known as the Teachings of Abraham ® . (Should you like to hear one of the original recordings detailing our introduction to Abraham, you can fnd our free Introduction to Abraham recording as a 70-minute download at our Website:"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 www. abraham-hicks.com , or from our offce as a free CD.) In 1985 when this phenomenon began with Esther, I could sense that this would bring the answers to my desire to better understand the Laws of the Universe and how we might be able to naturally, deliberately work in harmony with them in order to ful-fll our purpose for being in physical form. And so, about 20 years ago, I sat with Esther and a small cassette tape recorder and plied Abraham with hundreds of questions on primarily 20 different subjects, mostly regarding practical spirituality. And then, as other people began hearing about Abraham and wanting to interact with us, we produced those 20 recordings and published them as two special-subjects albums. Over the course of two decades, millions of people have become aware of the Teachings of Abraham as a result of our many books, tapes, CDs, videos, DVDs, group workshops, and radio and television appearances. Also, other best-selling authors soon began to use Abraham’s teachings in their books and radio, television, and workshop appearances . . . and then, about two years ago, an Australian television producer approached us requesting permission to build a TV series around our work with Abraham. She joined us with her flm crew on one of our Alaskan cruises, flmed the show, and then went in search of other students of our teachings whom she could incorporate into the (pilot) flm—and the rest is (as they say) history. The producer called her movie The Secret, and it featured the basic tenet of the Teachings of Abraham: the Law of Attraction. And although it wasn’t picked up by the Australian network (Nine) as a series, the documentary went straight to the DVD format and was transcribed into a book . . . and now because of The Secret, the concept of the Law of Attraction has reached many more millions of people who have been asking for a better-feeling life. This book has evolved from the transcription of fve of our original recordings from over 20 years ago. This is the frst time these transcriptions have been available in print. However, they’re not word for word because Abraham has now gone through every page of the original transcriptions and modifed every part that might be made easier for the reader to understand and to put into immediate practical use. There’s a saying in the teaching world: “Tell them what you’re going to tell them. Then tell them. And then tell them what you told them.” And so, should you decide to immerse yourself in these teachings, you’ll probably notice much repetition as you move forward, because we usually learn best through repetition. You can’t continue the same old habitual, limiting thought patterns and get new, unlimited results. But through simple, practiced repetition, you can, over time, comfortably develop new life-enhancing habits. In the media world there’s a saying: “People would rather be entertained than informed.” Well, unless you’re entertained by learning new ways of looking at life, you’ll probably fnd this book more informative than entertaining. Rather than being like a novel that’s read, enjoyed, and then set"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 aside, this—more like a textbook on the principles of achieving and maintaining wealth, health, and happiness—is a book to be read and studied and put into practiced use. I was led to this information by my desire to help others feel better, especially in the area of fnancial fulfllment, so I feel especially gratifed that this Money book is now on its way to those who are asking the questions that it will answer. This book, Money, and the Law of Attraction, is the second of four scheduled Law of Attraction books. Two years ago we published The Law of Attraction: The Basics of the Teachings of Abraham. Next will be Relationships, and the Law of Attraction; and the fnal book in the series will be Spirituality, and the Law of Attraction. Revisiting this life-changing material in preparation for the publication of this book has been a delightful experience for Esther and me, for we’ve been reminded again of these basic and simple principles that Abraham discussed with us in the beginning of our interaction. From the beginning, Esther and I have intended to apply to our lives what Abraham has been teaching. And our resulting joyous growth experience has been remarkable: After two decades of practicing these principles, Esther and I are still in love. (Even though we have just now completed building this new home in California and are in the process of the construction of a new home on our Texas business complex, we enjoy being with each other so much that we will still spend most of next year traveling in our 45-foot-long Marathon motor coach from workshop to workshop.) We’ve had no medical examinations (or insurance) for 20 years. We’re debt free, and will pay more income taxes this year than the sum of all the money we earned in all of our earning years before Abraham’s guidance—and although neither all our money nor all of our good health can make us happy, Esther and I are still fnding ways to be happy anyway. And so, it is with extraordinary joy that we can tell you—from our own personal experience: This works! ( Editor’s Note: Please note that since there aren’t always physical English words to perfectly express the Non-Physical thoughts that Esther receives, she sometimes forms new combinations of words, as well as using standard words in new ways—for example, capitalizing them when normally they wouldn’t be—in order to express new ways of looking at old ways of looking at life.)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 PART I. Pivoting and the Book of Positive Aspects Your Story, and the Law of Attraction Each and every component that makes up your life experience is drawn to you by the powerful Law of Attraction ’s response to the thoughts you think and the story you tell about your life. Your money and fnancial assets; your body’s state of wellness, clarity, fexibility, size, and shape; your work environment, how you are treated, work satisfaction, and rewards—indeed, the very happiness of your life experience in general— is all happening because of the story that you tell. If you will let your dominant intention be to revise and improve the content of the story you tell every day of your life, it is our absolute promise to you that your life will become that ever-improving story. For by the powerful Law of Attraction, it must be! 4. Does Life Sometimes Seem to Be Unfair? You have wanted more success and you have applied yourself well, doing everything that everyone said you should do, but the success you have been seeking has been slow to come. You tried very hard, especially at frst, to learn all the right things, to be in the right places, to do the right things, to say the right things . . . but often things did not appear to be improving much at all. Earlier in your life, when you were frst dipping your toe into the idea of achieving success, you found satisfaction in satisfying the expectations of the others who were laying out the rules for success. The teachers, parents, and mentors who surrounded you seemed confdent and convincing as they laid out their rules for success: “Always be on time; always do your best; remember to work hard; always be honest; strive for greatness; go the extra mile; there’s no gain without pain; and, most important, never give up. . . .” But, over time, your fnding satisfaction from gaining the approval of those who laid out those rules waned as their principles of success—no matter how hard you tried—did not yield you the promised results. And it was more disheartening still when you stood back to gain some perspective on the whole picture and realized that their principles were not, for the most part, bringing them real success either. And then, to make matters even worse, you began meeting others (who clearly were not following those rules) who were achieving success apart from the formula that you had been so diligent to learn and apply."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 And so you found yourself asking: “What’s going on here? How can those who are working so hard be receiving so little, while those who seem to be working so little are achieving so much? My expensive education hasn’t paid off at all—and yet that multimillionaire dropped out of high school. My father worked hard every day of his life—and yet our family had to borrow the money to pay for his funeral. . . . Why doesn’t my hard work pay off for me the way it was supposed to? Why do so few really get rich, while most of us struggle to barely get by? What am I missing? What do those fnancially successful people know that I don’t know?” 5. Is “Doing Your Best” Still Not Enough? When you are doing everything you can think of, truly trying your best to do what you have been told is supposed to bring you success, and success does not come, it is easy to feel defensive, and eventually even angry at those who are displaying evidence of the success you desire. You even fnd yourself sometimes condemning their success simply because it is too painful to watch them living the success that continues to elude you. And it is for this reason—in response to this chronic condition in the fnancial affairs of your culture—that we offer this book. When you come to the place of openly condemning the fnancial success that you crave, not only can that fnancial success never come to you, but you are also forgeiting your God-given rights to your health and happiness as well. Many actually come to the incorrect conclusion that others in their physical environment have banded together in some sort of conspiracy to keep them from succeeding. For they believe, with all of their heart, that they have done everything possible to achieve success, and the fact that it has not come must surely mean that there are some unfriendly forces at work that are depriving them of what they desire. But we want to assure you that nothing like that is at the heart of the absence of what you desire or of the presence of things you would like to remove from your experience. No one ever has or ever could have prevented your success—or provided it. Your success is all up to you. It is all in your control. And we are writing this book so that now, fnally, once and for all time, your success can be in your deliberate and conscious control."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 6. Whatever I Can Desire, I Can Achieve It is time for you to return to the true nature of your Being and to consciously live the success that the experiencing of your own life has helped you determine that you desire. And so, as you deliber- ately relax right now, breathing deeply and reading steadily, you will begin to gradually but surely remember how all success comes, for you already inherently understand it, and so you will certainly feel resonance with these absolute truths as you read about them here. The Eternal Laws of the Universe are consistent and reliable and steadily hold, always, the promise of expansion and joy. They are being presented to you here in a powerful rhythm of understanding that will start small within you and then expand with each page you read, until you reawaken into the knowledge of your purpose and your own personal power as you remember how to access the power of the Universe that creates worlds. If this time-space reality has within it the ability to inspire a desire within you, it is absolute that this time-space reality has the ability to yield you a full and satisfying manifestation of that same desire. It is Law. 7. To Achieve Success Is My Natural Birthright Most people naturally assume that if their life is not going the way they want it to go, something outside of themselves must be preventing the improvement, for no one would deliberately hold their own success away. But while pointing the blame at others may feel better than assuming responsibility for unwanted conditions, there is a very big negative repercussion to believing that something outside of you is the reason for your own lack of success: When you give the credit or the blame to another for your success or lack of it—you are powerless to make any change. When you desire success, but—from your perspective—you are not currently experiencing it, at many deep levels of your Being you recognize that something is wrong. And as this strong feeling of personal discord magnifes your awareness that you are not getting what you want, it often sets into motion other counterproductive assumptions that evoke jealousy toward those who are having more success; resentment at a myriad of people you would like to blame for your lack of success; or even self-denigration, which is the most painful and counterproductive assumption of all. And we submit that this uncomfortable upheaval is not only normal, but it is the perfect response to your feeling a lack of success."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 Your emotional discomfort is a powerful indicator that something is very wrong. You are meant to succeed, and failure should feel bad to you. You are meant to be well, and sickness should not be accepted. You are supposed to expand, and stagnation is intolerable. Life is supposed to go well for you—and when it does not, there is something wrong. But what is wrong is not that an injustice has occurred, or that the gods of good fortune are not focusing on you, or that someone else has received the success that should have been yours. What is wrong is that you are out of harmony with your own Being, with who-you-really-are, with what life has caused you to ask for, with what you have expanded to, and with the ever-consistent Laws of the Universe. What is wrong is not something that is outside of you over which you have no control. What is wrong is within you—and you do have control. And taking control is not diffcult to do once you understand the basis of who-you-are and the basics of the Law of Attraction and the value of your personal Emotional Guidance System that you were born with, which is always active, ever present, and easy to understand. 8. Money Is Not the Root of Evil or of Happiness This important subject of money and fnancial success is not the “root of all evil” as many have quoted—nor is it the path to happiness. However, because the subject of money touches most of you in one way or another hundreds or even thousands of times in every day, it is a large factor in your vibrational makeup and in your personal point of attraction. So when you are able to suc- cessfully control something that affects most of you all day, every day, you will have accomplished something rather signifcant. In other words, because such a high percentage of your thoughts in any given day reside around the topic of money or fnancial success, as soon as you are able to deliberately guide your thoughts, not only is it certain that your fnancial success must improve, but the evidence of that success will then prepare you for deliberate improvement in every aspect of your life experience. If you are a student of Deliberate Creation, if you want to consciously create your own reality, if you desire control of your own life experience, if you want to fulfll your reason for being, then your understanding of these prevalent topics— money and the Law of Attraction —will serve you enormously well."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21 9. I Am the Attractor of My Every Experience You are meant to live an expansive, exhilarating, good-feeling experience. It was your plan when you made the decision to become focused in your physical body in this time-space reality. You expected this physical life to be exciting and rewarding. In other words, you knew that the variety and contrast would stimulate you to expanded desires, and you also knew that any and all of those desires could be fully and easily realized by you. You knew, also, that there would be no end to the expansion of new desires. You came into your body full of excitement about the possibilities that this life experience would inspire, and that desire that you held in the beginning was not muted at all by trepidation or doubt, for you knew your power and you knew that this life experience and all of its contrast would be the fertile ground for wonderful expansion. Most of all, you knew that you were coming into this life experience with a Guidance System to help you remain true to your original intent as well as to your never-ending amended intentions that would be born out of this very life experience. In short, you felt an eagerness for this time-space reality that nearly defes physical description. You were not a beginner—even though you were newly beginning in your wee, small physical body—but instead you were a powerful creative genius, newly focusing in a new, Leading Edge environment. You knew that there would be a time of adjustment while redefning a new platform from which you would begin your process of deliberate creating, and you were not the least bit wor- ried about that time of adjustment. In fact, you rather enjoyed the nest into which you were born and those who were there to greet you into your new physical environment. And while you could not yet speak the language of their words—and although you were perceived by those who greeted you as new and unknowing and in need of their guidance—you possessed a stability and a knowing that most of them had long left behind. You were born knowing that you are a powerful Being, that you are good, that you are the creator of your experience, and that the Law of Attraction is the basis of all creation here in your new environment. You remembered then that the Law of Attraction (the essence of that which is like unto itself, is drawn) is the basis of the Universe, and you knew it would serve you well. And so it has. You were still remembering then that you are the creator of your own experience. But even more important, you remembered that you do it through your thought, not your action. You were not uncomfortable being a small infant who offered no action or words, for you remembered the Well-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 Being of the Universe; you remembered your intentions in coming forth into your physical body, and you knew that there would be plenty of time for acclimating to the language and ways of your new environment; and, most of all, you knew that even though you would not be able to translate your vast knowledge from your Non-Physical environment directly into physical words and descriptions, it would not matter, for the most important things to set you on a path of joyful creation were already emphatically in place: You knew that the Law of Attraction was consistently present and that your Guidance System was immediately active. And, most of all, you knew that by trial, and what some may call “error,” you would eventually become completely and consciously reoriented in your new environment. 10. I Knew of the Consistency of the Law of Attraction The fact that the Law of Attraction remains constant and stable throughout the Universe was a big factor in your confdence as you came into your new physical environment, for you knew that the feedback of life would help you to remember and gain your footing. You remembered that the basis of everything is vibration and that the Law of Attraction responds to those vibrations and, in essence, organizes them, bringing things of like vibrations together while holding those not of like vibrations apart. And so, you were not concerned about not being able to articulate that knowledge right away or to explain it to those around you who had seemingly forgotten everything they knew about it, because you knew that the consistency of this powerful Law would, soon enough, show itself to you through the examples of your own life. You knew then that it would not be diffcult to fgure out what kinds of vibrations you were offering because the Law of Attraction would be bringing to you constant evidence of whatever your vibration was. In other words, when you feel overwhelmed, circumstances and people who could help you get out from under your feeling of overwhelment cannot fnd you, nor can you fnd them. Even when you try hard to fnd them, you cannot. And those people who do come do not help you, but, instead, they add to your feeling of overwhelment. When you feel mistreated —fairness cannot fnd you. Your perception of your mistreatment, and the subsequent vibration that you offer because of your perception, prevents anything that you would consider to be fair from coming to you."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 When you are buried in the disappointment or fear of not having the fnancial resources that you believe you need, the dollars—or the opportunities that would bring the dollars—continue to elude you . . . not because you are bad or unworthy, but because the Law of Attraction matches things that are like, not things that are un like. When you feel poor —only things that feel like poverty can come to you. When you feel prosperous —only things that feel like prosperity can come to you. This Law is consistent; and if you will pay attention, it will teach you, through life experience, how it works. When you remember that you get the essence of what you think about—and then you notice what you are getting—you have the keys for Deliberate Creation. 11. What Do We Mean by Vibration? When we speak of vibration, we are actually calling your attention to the basis of your experience, for everything is actually vibrationally based. We could use the word Energy interchangeably, and there are many other synonyms in your vocabulary that accurately apply. Most understand the vibrational characteristics of sound. Sometimes when the deep, rich bass notes of your musical instrumentation are played loudly, you can even feel the vibrational nature of sound. We want you to understand that whenever you “hear” something, you are interpreting vibration into the sound you are hearing. What you hear is your interpretation of vibration; what you hear is your unique interpretation of vibration. Each of your physical senses of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and touching exist because everything in the Universe is vibrating and your physical senses are reading the vibrations and giving you sensory perception of the vibrations. So as you come to understand that you live in a pulsating, vibrating Universe of advanced harmonics, and that at the very core of your Being you are vibrating at what could only be described as perfection in vibrational balance and harmony, then you begin to understand vibration in the way we are projecting it. Everything that exists, in your air, in your dirt, in your water, and in your bodies, is vibration in motion—and all of it is managed by the powerful Law of Attraction."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 You could not sort it out if you wanted to. And there is no need for you to sort it out, because the Law of Attraction is doing the sorting, continually bringing things of like vibrations together while things of different vibrational natures are being repelled. Your emotions, which really are the most powerful and important of your six physical vibrational interpreters, give you constant feedback about the harmonics of your current thoughts (vibrations) as they compare with the harmonics of your core vibrational state. The Non-Physical world is vibration. The physical world that you know is vibration. There is nothing that exists outside of this vibrational nature. There is nothing that is not managed by the Law of Attraction. Your understanding of vibration will help you to consciously bridge both worlds. You do not have to understand your complex optic nerve or your primary visual cortex in order to see. You do not have to understand electricity to be able to turn on the light, and you do not have to understand vibrations in order to feel the difference between harmony or discord. As you learn to accept your vibrational nature, and begin to consciously utilize your emotional vibrational indicators, you will gain conscious control of your personal creations and of the outcomes of your life experience. 12. Whenever I Feel Abundant, Abundance Finds Me When you make the conscious correlation between what you have been feeling and what is actualizing in your life experience, now you are empowered to make changes. If you are not making that correlation, and so continue to offer thoughts of lack about things you want, the things you want will continue to elude you. People, often, in this misunderstanding begin to assign power to things outside of themselves in order to explain why they are not thriving in the way they would like: “I’m not thriving because I was born into the wrong environment. I’m not thriving because my parents didn’t thrive, so they couldn’t teach me how to do it. I’m not thriving because those people over there are thriving, and they’re taking the resources that should have been mine. I’m not thriving because I was cheated,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25 because I’m not worthy, because I didn’t live the right way in a past life, because my government ignores my rights, because my husband doesn’t do his part . . . because, because, because.” And we want to remind you, your “not thriving” is only because you are offering a vibration that is different from the vibration of thriving. You cannot feel poor (and vibrate poor) and thrive. Abundance cannot fnd you unless you offer a vibration of abundance. Many ask, “But if I’m not thriving, then how in the world can I offer a vibration of thriving? Don’t I have to thrive before I can offer the vibration of thriving?” We agree that it is certainly easy to maintain a condition of thriving when it is already in your experience, because then all you have to do is notice the good that is coming and your observation of it will keep it coming. But if you are standing in the absence of something you want, you must fnd a way to feel the essence of it—even before it comes—or it cannot come. You cannot let your vibrational offering come only in response to what-is and then ever change what-is. You must fnd a way of feeling the excitement or satisfaction of your currently unrealized dreams before those dreams can become your reality. Find a way to deliberately imagine a scenario for the purpose of offering a vibration and for the purpose of the Law of Attraction matching your vibration with a real-life manifestation. . . . When you ask for the manifestation prior to the vibration, you ask the impossible. When you are willing to offer the vibration before the manifestation—all things are possible. It is Law. 13. Rather Than by Default, Live Life Deliberately We are giving this book to you to remind you of things you already know at some level, so as to reactivate that vibrational knowledge within you. It is not possible for you to read these words, which represent the knowledge that you hold from your Broader Perspective, without a recognition of this knowledge beginning to surface from within. This really is the time of awakening—the time of remembering your personal power and your reason for being. So take a deep breath, make an effort to get comfortable, and slowly read the contents of this book to restore yourself to your original vibrational essence. . . . So here you are, in a wonderful state of being: no longer an infant under the control of others, somewhat acclimated into your physical environment, and now—by reading this book—returning"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26 to the recognition of the full power of your Being . . . no longer buffeted around by the Law of Attraction like a small cork on a raging sea, but fnally remembering and gaining control of your own destiny, fnally and deliberately guiding your life within the powerful Law of Attraction rather than responding in an attitude of default and just taking life as it comes. In order to do that, you have to tell a different story. You have to begin to tell the story of your life as you now want it to be and discontinue the tales of how it has been or of how it is. 14. Tell the Story You Want to Experience To live deliberately, you have to think deliberately; and in order to do that, you must have a reference point in order to determine the correct direction of your thought. Right now, just as at the time of your birth, the two necessary factors are in place. The Law of Attraction (the most powerful and consistent Law in the Universe) abounds. And your Guidance System is within you, all queued up and ready to give you directional feedback. You have only one seemingly small but potentially life-changing thing to do: You have to begin telling your story in a new way. You have to tell it as you want it to be. As you tell the story of your life (and you do it nearly all day, every day with your words, your thoughts, and your actions), you have to feel good while you tell it. In every moment, about every subject, you can focus positively or negatively, for in every particle of the Universe—in every moment in time and beyond—there is that which is wanted and the lack of what is wanted pulsing there for you to choose between. And as these constant choices reveal themselves to you, you have the option of focusing upon what you want or the lack of it regarding every subject, because every subject is really two subjects: what you want or the absence of what you want. You can tell, by the way you feel, which choice you are currently focused upon—and you can change your choice constantly. 15. Every Subject Is Really Two Subjects The following are some examples to help you see how every subject is really two subjects: Abundance/Poverty (absence of abundance) Health/Illness (absence of health) Happiness/Sadness (absence of happiness) Clarity/Confusion (absence of clarity) Energetic/Tired (absence of Energy) Knowledge/Doubt (absence of knowledge) Interested/Bored (absence of interest)"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27 I can do that/I can’t do that I want to buy that/I can’t afford that I want to feel good/I don’t feel good I want more money/I don’t have enough money I want more money/I don’t know how to get more money I want more money/That person is getting more money than his/her share I want to be slender/I am fat I want a new car/My car is old I want a lover/I don’t have a lover As you read this list, it is undoubtedly obvious to you which we consider to be the better choice in each example, but there is a simple and important thing that you may be forgetting. There is a tendency as you read a list such as this to feel a need to state the factual truth about the subject (“tell it like it is”) rather than make the statement of what you desire. That tendency alone is responsible for more miscreating and more personal disallowing of wanted things than all other things put together, and so, the examples and exercises offered in this book are given to help you orient yourself toward what is wanted, not to explain what already is. You have to begin telling a different story if you want the Law of Attraction to bring you different things. 16. What Is the Story I’m Now Telling? A very effective way to begin to tell that new story is to listen to the things that you are now saying throughout your day, and when you catch yourself in the middle of a statement that is contrary to what you want, stop and say, “Well, I clearly know what it is that I don’t want. What is it that I do want?” Then deliberately and emphatically make your statement of desire. I hate this ugly, old, unreliable car. I want a pretty, new, reliable car. I’m fat. I want to be slender. My employer doesn’t appreciate me. I want to be appreciated by my employer. Many would protest, claiming that a simple rewording of a sentence will not make a shiny new car appear in your driveway, or change your fat body to one that is slender, or cause your employer to"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28 suddenly change her personality and begin to treat you differently—but they would be wrong. When you deliberately focus upon any desired subject, often proclaiming it to be as you want it to be, in time you experience an actual shift in the way you feel about the subject, which indicates a vibrational shift. When your vibration shifts, your point of attraction shifts, and, by the powerful Law of Attraction, your manifestational evidence or indicator must shift, also. You cannot talk consistently of the things you do want to experience in your life without the Universe delivering the essence of them to you. 17. The Pivoting Process Can Reorient My Life The Process of Pivoting is a conscious recognition that every subject is really two subjects, and then a deliberate speaking or thinking about the desired aspect of the subject. Pivoting will help you activate within yourself the aspects that you desire regarding all subjects; and once you accomplish that, the essence of the things that you desire, on all subjects, must come into your experience. There is an important clarifcation that we must make here: If you are using words that speak of something that you desire while at the same time you are feeling doubt about your own words, your words are not bringing you what you want, because the way you are feeling is the true indication of the creative direction of your thought-vibration. The Law of Attraction is not responding to your words but to the vibration that is emanating from you. However, since you cannot speak of what you do want and what you do not want at the same time, the more you speak of what you do want, the less frequently you will be speaking of what you do not want. And if you are serious about telling it like you want it to be rather than like it is, you will, in time (and usually a rather short time), change the balance of your vibration. If you speak it often enough, you will come to feel what you speak. But there is something even more signifcantly powerful about this Process of Pivoting: When life seems to have you negatively oriented toward the lack of something you want, and when you make the statement “I know what I do not want; what is it that I do want?” the answer to that question is summoned from within you, and in that very moment the beginning of a vibrational shift occurs. Pivoting is a powerful tool that will instantly improve your life."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29 18. I Am the Creator of My Life Experience You are the creator of your own life experience, and as the creator of your experience, it is important to understand that it is not by virtue of your action, not by virtue of your doing—it is not even by virtue of what you are saying—that you are creating. You are creating by virtue of the thought that you are offering. You cannot speak or offer action without thought-vibration occurring at the same time; however, you are often offering a thought-vibration without offering words or action. Children or babies learn to mimic the vibration of the adults who surround them long before they learn to mimic their words. Every thought that you think has its own vibrational frequency. Each thought that you offer, whether it has come to you out of your memory, whether it is an infuence from another, or whether it is a thought that has become the combination of something you have been thinking and something that another has been thinking— every thought that you are pondering in your now —is vibrating at a very personal frequency . . . and by the powerful Law of Attraction (the essence of that which is like unto itself, is drawn), that thought is now attracting another thought that is its Vibrational Match. And now, those combined thoughts are vibrating at a frequency that is higher than the thought that came before; and they will now, by the Law of Attraction, attract another and another and another, until eventually the thoughts will be powerful enough to attract a “real life” situation or manifestation. All people, circumstances, events, and situations are attracted to you by the power of the thoughts that you are thinking. Once you understand that you are literally thinking or vibrating things into being, you may discover a new resolve within you to more deliberately direct your own thoughts. 19. Aligned Thoughts Are Thoughts That Feel Good Many people believe that there is more to their Beingness than what is represented in their physical reality as the fesh, blood, and bone person they know themselves to be. As people grapple with ways to label this larger part of themselves, they use words such as Soul, Source, or God. We refer to that larger, older, wiser part of you as your Inner Being, but the label that you choose to describe this Eternal part of you is not important. What is extremely signifcant is that you understand that the larger You does, and will eternally, exist and plays a very large part in the experience that you are living here on planet Earth."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 Every thought, word, or deed that you offer is played against the backdrop of that Broader Perspective. Indeed, the reason that in any moment of clearly knowing what you do not want, you emphatically then realize what it is that you do want is because that larger part of you is giving its undivided attention to what you do want. As you make a conscious effort to guide your thoughts, day by day, more in the direction of what you do want, you will begin to feel better and better because the vibration that is activated by your improved-feeling thought will be a closer match to the vibration of the larger Non-Physical part of you. Your desire to think thoughts that feel good will guide you into alignment with the Broader Perspective of your Inner Being. In fact, it is not possible for you to really feel good in any moment unless the thoughts you are thinking right now are a Vibrational Match to the thoughts of your Inner Being. For example, your Inner Being focuses upon your value—when you identify some faw in yourself, the negative emotion that you feel is about that vibrational discord or resistance. Your Inner Being chooses to focus only upon things about which it can feel love—when you are focusing upon some aspect of someone or something that you abhor, you have focused yourself out of vibra-tional alignment with your Inner Being. Your Inner Being focuses only upon your success—when you choose to see something you are doing as failure, you are out of alignment with the perspective of your Inner Being. 20. Seeing My World Through the Eyes of Source By choosing better-feeling thoughts and by speaking more of what you do want and less of what you do not want, you will gently tune yourself to the vibrational frequency of your broader, wiser Inner Being. To be in vibrational alignment with that Broader Perspective while living your own physical life experience is truly the best of all worlds because as you achieve vibrational alignment with that Broader Perspective, you then see your world from that Broader Perspective. To see your world through the eyes of Source is truly the most spectacular view of life, for from that vibrational vantage point, you are in alignment with—and therefore in the process of attracting— only what you would consider to be the very best of your world."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 Esther, the woman who translates the vibration of Abraham into the spoken or written word, does so by relaxing and deliberately allowing the vibration of her own Being to raise until it harmonizes with the Non-Physical vibration of Abraham. She has been doing this for many years now, and it has become a very natural thing for her to do. She has long understood the advantage of aligning her vibration so that she could effectively translate our knowledge for other physical friends, but she had not really understood another wonderful beneft of that alignment until one beautiful spring morning when she walked down the driveway by herself to open the gate for her mate, who would eventually follow in the automobile. As she stood there waiting, she gazed up into the sky and found it to be more beautiful than it had ever appeared before: It was rich in color, and the contrast of the brilliant blue sky and the strikingly white clouds was amazing to her. She could hear the sweet songs of birds that were so far away she could not see them, but their beautiful sound made her shiver with excitement as she heard them. They sounded as if they were right above her head or sitting on her shoulder. And then she became aware of many different delicious fragrances fowing from plants and fowers and earth, moving in the wind and enveloping her. She felt alive and happy and in love with her beautiful world. And she said right out loud, “There can never have been, in all of the Universe, a more beautiful moment in time than this, right here, right now!” And then she said, “Abraham, it is you, isn’t it?” And we smiled a very broad smile through her lips, for she had caught us peeping through her eyes, hearing through her ears, smelling through her nose, feeling through her skin. “Indeed,” we said, “we are enjoying the deliciousness of your physical world through your physical body.” Those moments in your life when you feel absolute exhilaration are moments of complete alignment with the Source within you. Those moments when you feel powerful attraction to an idea, or keen interest, are also moments of complete alignment. In fact, the better you feel, the more in alignment you are with your Source— with who-you-really-are. This alignment with your Broader Perspective will not only allow you faster achievement of the big things that you want in life—like wonderful relationships, satisfying careers, and the resources to do the things you really want to do—but this conscious alignment will enhance every moment of your day. As you tune yourself to the perspective of your Inner Being, your days will be flled with wonderful moments of clarity, satisfaction, and love. And that is truly the way you intended to live while here in this wonderful place, this wonderful time, and this wonderful body."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 21. I Can Deliberately Choose to Feel Better The reason that Esther was able to allow that fuller perspective of Abraham to fow through her, providing her with such a delicious experience, was because she had begun that day by looking for reasons to feel good. She looked for the frst thing to feel good about while she was still lying in her bed, and that good-feeling thought attracted another and another and another and another and another, until by the time she reached the gate (which was approximately two hours later), by virtue of her deliberate choice of thoughts, she had brought her vibrational frequency to a level that was close enough to matching that of her Inner Being that her Inner Being was able to easily interact with her. Not only does the thought you are choosing right now attract the next thought and the next . . . and so on—it also provides the basis of your alignment with your Inner Being. As you consistently and deliberately think and speak more of what you do want and less of what you do not want, you will fnd yourself more often in alignment with the pure, positive essence of your own Source; and under those conditions, your life will be extremely pleasing to you. 22. Could Illness Be Caused by Negative Emotion? Esther’s experience at the gate was dramatically enhanced by her vibrational alignment with her Source and therefore with absolute Well-Being. But it is also possible for you to experience the opposite of that enhanced experience if you are out of alignment with Source and Well-Being. In other words, sickness or illness, or lack of Well-Being, occurs when you vibrationally disallow your alignment with Well-Being. Whenever you experienced negative emotion ( fear, doubt, frustration, loneliness, and so on), that feeling of negative emotion was the result of your thinking a thought that did not vibrate at a frequency that was in harmony with your Inner Being. Through all of your life experiences— physical and Non-Physical—your Inner Being, or the Total You, has evolved to a place of knowing. And so, whenever you are consciously focused upon a thought that does not harmonize with that which your Inner Being has come to know—the resultant feeling within you will be one of negative emotion."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33 If you were to sit on your foot and cut off the circulation of the fow of blood, or if you were to put a tourniquet around your neck and restrict the fow of oxygen, you would feel immediate evidence of the restriction. And, in like manner, when you think thoughts that are not in harmony with the thoughts of your Inner Being, the fow of Life Force, or Energy, that comes into your physical body is stifed or restricted—and the result of that restriction is that you feel negative emotion. When you allow that negative emotion to continue over a long period of time, you often experience deterioration of your physical body. Remember, every subject is really two subjects: what is wanted or lack of what is wanted. It is like picking up a stick with two ends: One end represents what you do want; the other end represents what you do not want. So the stick called “Physical Well-Being” has “wellness” on one end and “illness” on the other. However, people do not experience “illness” only because they are looking at the negative end of the “Physical Well-Being” stick, but because they have been looking at the “I know what I don’t want” end of many, many sticks. When your chronic attention is upon things that you do not want—while the chronic attention of your Inner Being is upon the things that you do want—over time, you cause a vibrational separation between you and your Inner Being, and that is what all illness is: separation (caused by your choice of thoughts) between you and your Inner Being. 23. Pivot from Feeling Bad to Feeling Good Everyone wants to feel good, but most people believe that everything around them needs to be pleasing to them before they can feel good. In fact, most people feel the way they do in any moment in time because of something they are observing. If what they are observing pleases them, they feel good, but if what they are observing does not please them, they feel bad. Most people feel quite powerless about consistently feeling good because they believe that in order to feel good, the conditions around them must change, but they also believe that they do not have the power to change many of the condit ions. However, once you understand that every subject really is two subjects—what is wanted and lack of it—you can learn to see more of the positive aspects of whatever you are giving your attention to. That really is all that the Process of Pivoting is: deliberately looking for a more positive way—a better-feeling way—to approach whatever you are giving your attention to."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34 When you are facing an unwanted condition and are therefore feeling bad, if you will deliberately say, “I know what I do not want . . . what is it that I do want?” the vibration of your Being, which is affected by your point of focus, will shift slightly, causing your point of attraction to shift, also. This is the way that you begin telling a different story about your life. Rather than saying, “I never have enough money,” you say instead, “I’m looking forward to having more money.” That is a very different story—a very different vibration and a very different feeling, which will, in time, bring you a very different result. As you continue to ask yourself, from your ever-changing vantage point, “What is it that I do want?” eventually you will be standing in a very pleasing place—for you cannot continually ask yourself what it is that you do want without your point of attraction beginning to shift in that direction. . . . The process will be gradual, but your continued application of the process will yield wonderful results in only a few days. 24. Am I in Harmony with My Desire? So the Pivoting Process is simply: Whenever you recognize that you are feeling a negative emotion (it is really that you are feeling the lack of harmony with something that you want), the obvious thing for you to do is to stop and say, I’m feeling negative emotion, which means I am not in harmony with something that I want. What do I want? Anytime that you are feeling negative emotion, you are in a very good position to identify what it is that you are, in that moment, wanting—because never are you clearer about what you do want than when you are experiencing what you do not want. And so, stop, in that moment, and say: Something is important here; otherwise, I would not be feeling this negative emotion. What is it that I want? And then simply turn your attention to what you do want. . . . In the moment you turn your attention to what you want, the negative attraction will stop; and in the moment the negative attraction stops, the positive attraction will begin. And—in that moment—your feeling will change from not feeling good to feeling good. That is the Process of Pivoting. 25. What Do I Want, and Why? Perhaps the strongest resistance that people have to beginning to tell a different story about their own life is their belief that they should always speak “the truth” about where they are or that they should “tell it like it is.” But when you understand that the Law of Attraction is responding to you"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35 while you are telling your story of “how it is”—and therefore is perpetuating more of whatever story you are telling—you may decide that it really is in your best interest to tell a different story, a story that more closely matches what you would now like to live. When you acknowledge what you do not want, and then ask yourself, “What is it that I do want?” you begin a gradual shift into the telling of your new story and into a much-improved point of attraction. It is always helpful to remember that you get the essence of what you think about—whether you want it or not—because the Law of Attraction is unerringly consistent. Therefore, you are never only telling the story of “how it is now.” You are also telling the story of the future experience that you are creating right now. Sometimes people misunderstand what the Process of Pivoting is, as they incorrectly assume that to pivot means to look at something unwanted and try to convince themselves that it is wanted. They think that we are asking them to look at something that they clearly believe is wrong and to pronounce it right, or that it is a way of kidding themselves into accepting some unwanted thing. But you are never in a position where you can kid yourself into feeling better about something, because the way you feel is the way you feel, and the way you feel is always a result of the thought that you have chosen. It is really a wonderful thing that, through the process of living life and noticing the things around you that you do not want, you are then able to come to clear conclusions about what you do want. And when you care about how you feel, you can easily apply the Process of Pivoting to direct your attention toward more of the wanted aspects, and less of the unwanted aspects, of life. And then, as the Law of Attraction responds to your increasingly improved, better-feeling thoughts, you will notice your own life experience transforming to match more of those wanted aspects, while the unwanted aspects gradually fade out of your experience. When you deliberately apply the Process of Pivoting, which means you are deliberately choosing your own thoughts, which means you are deliberately choosing your vibrational point of attraction, you are also deliberately choosing how your life unfolds. Pivoting is the process of deliberately focusing your attention with the intent of directing your own life experience."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36 26. I Can Feel Better Right Now People often complain that it would be much easier for them to focus on something positive if it were already happening in their life experience. They accurately acknowledge that it is much easier to feel good about something when something good is already happening. We certainly do not disagree that it is easier to feel good while noticing things you believe are good. But if you believe that you only have the ability to focus upon what is happening, and if what is happening is not pleasing, then you could wait an entire lifetime because your attention to unwanted things is preventing wanted things from coming to you.You do not have to wait for a good thing to happen in order to feel good, for you have the ability to direct your thoughts toward improved things no matter what is currently present in your experience. And when you care about how you feel and you are willing to pivot and turn your attention toward better-feeling thoughts, you will quickly begin the positive, deliberate transformation of your life. Things that are coming into your experience are coming in response to your vibration. Your vibration is offered because of the thoughts you are thinking, and you can tell by the way you feel what kinds of thoughts you are thinking. Find good-feeling thoughts and good-feeling manifesta- tions must follow. Many people say, “It would be so much easier for me to be happy if I were in a different place: if my relationship were better, if my mate were easier to live with, if my physical body didn’t hurt or if my body looked different, if my work was more fulflling, if I only had more money. . . . If the conditions of my life were better, I would feel better, and then it would be easier for me to be thinking more positive thoughts.” Seeing pleasing things does feel good, and it is easier to feel good when a pleasing thing is there, obvious for you to see—but you cannot ask others around you to orchestrate only pleasing things for you to see. Expecting others to provide the perfect environment for you is not a good idea, for many reasons: (1) It is not their responsibility to feather your nest; (2) it is not possible for them to control conditions you have created around you; and (3) most important of all, you would be giving up your power to create your own experience. Make a decision to look for the best-feeling aspects of whatever you must give your attention to, and otherwise look only for good-feeling things to give your attention to—and your life will become one of increasingly good-feeling aspects."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37 27. Attention to Unwanted Attracts More Unwanted For every pleasing thing, there is an unpleasing counterpart, for within every particle of the Universe is that which is wanted as well as the lack of that which is wanted. When you focus upon an unwanted aspect of something in an effort to push it away from you, instead it only comes closer, because you get what you give your attention to whether it is something that you want or not. You live in a Universe that is based on “inclusion.” In other words, there is no such thing as “exclusion” in this “inclusion-based” Universe. When you see something that you desire and you say yes to it, that is the equivalent of saying, “Yes, this thing that I desire, please come to me. ” When you see something that you do not want and you shout no at it, that is the equivalent of saying, “ Come to me, this thing that I do not want!” Within everything that surrounds you is that which is wanted and that which is unwanted. It is up to you to focus upon what is wanted. See your environment as a buffet of many choices, and make more deliberate choices about what you think about. If you will try to make choices that feel good to you, as you make an effort to tell a different story about your life and the people and experiences that are in it, you will see your life begin to transform to match the essence of the details of the new-and-improved story you are now telling. 28. Am I Focused upon the Wanted or the Unwanted? Sometimes you believe that you are focused upon what you want when actually the opposite is true. Just because your words sound positive, or your lips are smiling while you say them, does not mean that you are vibrating on the positive end of the stick. It is only by being aware of the way you are feeling while offering your words that you can be sure that you are, in fact, offering a vibration about what you do want, rather than what you do not want. 29. Focus on the Solution, Not the Problem In the midst of what the television weatherman was calling “a serious drought,” our friend Esther walked down one of the paths on their Texas Hill Country property, noticing the dryness of the grass and feeling real concern for the well-being of the beautiful trees and bushes that were all beginning to show signs of stress from the shortage of rain. She noticed that the birdbath was empty"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38 even though she had flled it with water just a few hours earlier, and then she thought about the thirsty deer who had probably jumped the fence to drink the small amount of water that it held. And so, as she was pondering the direness of the situation, she stopped, looked upward, and—in a very positive voice, with very positive-sounding words—said, “Abraham, I want some rain.” And we said immediately back to her, “Indeed, from this position of lack, you think you will get rain?” “What am I doing wrong?” she asked. And we asked, “Why do you want the rain?” And Esther answered, “I want it because it refreshes the earth. I want it because it gives all of the creatures in the bushes water so that they have enough to drink. I want it because it makes the grass green, and it feels good upon my skin, and it makes us all feel better.” And we said, “Now, you are attracting rain.” Our question “ Why do you want the rain?” helped Esther withdraw her attention from the problem and turn her attention toward the solution. When you consider why you want something, your vibration usually shifts or pivots in the direction of your desire. Whenever you consider how it will happen, or when, or who will bring it, your vibration usually then shifts back toward the problem. You see, in the process of taking her attention from what was wrong—by our asking her why she wanted the rain—she accomplished a pivot. She began thinking not only of what she wanted, but why she wanted it; and in the process, she began to feel better. That afternoon it rained, and that night the local weatherman reported “an unusual isolated thunderstorm in the Hill Country.” Your thoughts are powerful, and you have much more control over your own experience than most of you realize. 30. What I do want is to feel good We visited with the young father who was at his wits‘ end because his son was wetting the bed every night. This father was not only frustrated about the physical disruption of finding wet bedding and clothing every morning but he was concerned about the emotional ramifications because it had been going on for such a long time, and frankly he was embarrassed by his son’s behavior. “He’s too big for this”, he complained to us. We asked him, “When you come into the bedroom in the morning, what happens?” “Well, as soon as I walk into his room I can tell by the odor that he’s wet the bed again”, he told us. “And how do you feel about that?” “Helpless, angry, frustrated. This has been going on for a long time and I don’t know what to do about it”, he said."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39 “What do you say to your son?” “I tell him to get out of those wet clothes and get into the bathtub. I tell him, he’s too big for this and that we’ve talked about this before”. We told this father that he was actually perpetuating bed wetting. We explained to him, when the way you feel is controlled by a condition, you can never influence a change in the condition. But when you’re able to control the way you feel within a condition, then you have the power to influence change in the condition. For example, when you enter your son’s bedroom, and become aware that something that you do not want has happened, if you would stop for a moment to think about that thing that has happened that you do not want, asking yourself what it is that you do want, and then further enforcing that side of the pivotal equation by asking yourself why you want it, not only would you immediately feel better, but you would soon begin to see the results of your positive influence. “What do you want?” we asked. He said, “I want my little one to wake up happy and dry and proud of himself and to not be embarrassed”. This father felt relief as he focused upon what he wanted, because in making that effort he found harmony with his desire. We told him, “As you’re thinking those sorts of thoughts, then what will be oozing out of you will be harmony with what you do want rather than harmony with what you do not want. And you will be more positively influencing your son. Then words will come out of you such as, “Oh, this is all part of growing up. And all of us have been through this. And you’re growing up very fast. Now get out of those wet clothes and get into the bathtub””. This young father called very soon after that and happily reported that the bed wetting had stopped. 31. Whenever I’m feeling bad, I’m attracting unwanted While almost everyone is aware of how they feel in varying degrees, there are few who understand the important guidance that their feelings, or emotions, provide. In the most simple of terms, whenever you feel bad, you’re in the process of attracting something that will not please you. Without exception, the reason for negative emotion is because you’re focused upon something you do not want, or upon the lack or absence of something that you do want. Many regard negative emotion as something unwanted, but we prefer to see it as important guidance to help you understand the direction of your focus, therefore the direction of your vibration, therefore the direction of what you’re attracting. You could call it a ‘warning bell’"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40 because it certainly does give you a signal that lets you know that it’s time to pivot. We prefer to call it a ‘guiding bell’. Your emotions are your guidance system to assist you in understanding what you are in the process of creating with every thought you think. Often people, who are beginning to understand the power of thought and the importance of focusing upon good feeling subjects, are embarrassed or even angry at themselves when they find themselves in the midst of negative emotion. But there is no reason to be angry at yourself for having a perfectly functioning guidance system. Whenever you become aware that you’re feeling negative emotion, begin by complimenting yourself for being aware of your guidance, and then gently try to improve the feeling by choosing thoughts that feel better. We would call this a very subtle process of pivoting, whereby you gently choose better-feeling thoughts. Whenever you feel negative emotion, you could say to yourself, “I’m feeling some negative emotion, which means I’m in the process of attracting something that I do not want. What is it that I do want?” Often just acknowledging that you want to feel good will help turn your thoughts in a better-feeling direction. But it is important to understand the distinction between wanting to feel good and not wanting to feel bad. Some people think that it’s just two different ways of saying the same thing, when actually those two statements are exact opposite with huge vibrational differences. If you can begin to orient your thoughts by steadily looking for things that cause you to feel good, you will begin to develop patterns of thoughts, or beliefs, that will help you create magnificent good feeling lives. 32. My thoughts dovetail into stronger matching thoughts Whatever thought you’re focused upon, whether it’s a memory from your past, something that you’re observing in your present, or something you’re anticipating in your future, that thought is active within you right now, and it is attracting other thoughts and ideas that are similar. Not only do your thoughts attract other thoughts that are of a similar nature, but the longer you focus, the stronger the thoughts become and the more attraction power they amass."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41 Our friend Jerry likens this to the ropes he once observed while watching a large ship being docked. It was to be tied with a rope that was very large, too big and bulky to be thrown across the expansive water. And so instead, a small ball of twine was tossed across the water to the dock. That twine had been spliced into a little bigger rope, which had been spliced into a little bigger rope, which had been spliced into a little bigger rope, until eventually the very large rope could easily be pulled across the expansive water, and the ship was then secured to the dock. This is similar to the way your thoughts dovetail one to another, with one connecting to another, connecting to another.. and so on. Upon some subjects, because you’ve been pulling upon the negative rope longer, it’s very easy for you to get off on a negative tangent. In other words, it just takes a little negative utterance from someone, a memory of something or a suggestion that takes you into a negative tailspin right away. Your point of attraction predominantly occurs from the day to day things that you’re thinking about as you’re moving through your day. And you have the power to direct your thoughts positively or negatively. For example, you’re in a grocery store, and you notice that something that you regularly purchase has increased substantially in price, and you feel strong discomfort wash over you. You may very well think that you’re just feeling shock over the sudden spike in the price of this item, and that since you have no say in what the grocer charges for the items, that you have no option other than to feel discomfort about it. However, we want to point out to you that your feeling of discomfort is not because of the grocer’s action of raising the price of the goods for sale, but instead it’s because of the direction of your own thoughts. Just like the analogy of the rope tied to the rope tied to the rope tied to the rope, your thoughts are tied to one another and travel quickly to heightened vibrational places. For example, “Wow, the price of this is much greater than it was just last week. This price jump seems unreasonable. There’s nothing reasonable about the greed in the market place. Things are getting way out of hand. I don’t know where it’s all headed. It doesn’t seem like we can go on like this. Our economy’s in trouble. I can’t afford these inflated prices. I’m having a hard time making ends meet. I can’t seem to earn it fast enough to keep up with the increase in the cost of living.” And of course, this negative train of thought could move in any directions: toward blame of the grocer, to the economy, to your government.. But it usually always turns back to the way you feel that the situation will negatively impact you, because everything that you observe feels personal to"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42 you. And everything, in truth, is personal to you, because you’re offering a vibration about it that is affecting what is now being attracted to you by your choice of thoughts. If you are aware of how you are feeling, and you understand that your emotions are indicating the direction of your thoughts, then you can more deliberately guide your thoughts. For example, “Wow, the price of this is much greater than it was last week. However, I’m not aware of the other things in my basket. They could be the same or maybe even a bit lower. I wasn’t really paying attention. This one just got my attention because it was so much greater. Prices do fluctuate. I always manage. Things are going up a bit, but it’s working out alright. It is quite an impressive system of distribution that makes this variety of goods so accessible to us.” Once you’ve decided that care about feeling good, you will find it easier to more consistently choose a better feeling direction in your thoughts. When a desire to feel good is effectively active within you, a consistent inspiration toward good-feeling thoughts will be present. And you’ll find it easier and easier to direct your thoughts in productive directions. Your thoughts contain enormous creative attractive power that you harness effectively only by consistently offering good-feeling thoughts. When your thoughts constantly move back and forth between wanted and unwanted, pros and cons, pluses and minuses, you lose the benefit of the momentum of your pure positive thought. 33. Creating a book of positive aspects In the first year of Jerry and Esther’s work with us they were using small hotel meeting rooms in different cities. Always wanting to provide a comfortable place where people could gather to address their personal questions with us. There was a hotel in the city of Austin that always seemed to forget they were coming, even though Esther had made arrangements with the hotel, signed contracts, even called in the days just prior to the event to confirm. The hotel was always able to accommodate them, even though when they arrived no one seemed to be expecting them. But it was very uncomfortable for Jerry and Esther to be in the position of urging the hotel to hurry to get the room ready before their guests arrived. Finally Esther said, “I think we should find a new hotel”. And we said, “That might be a good idea, but remember, you will take yourselves with you”. “What do you mean”, Esther asked a bit defensively. We explained to her, “If you take action from your perspective of lack, the action is always counterproductive. In fact, it is likely that the new hotel will treat you just like the last one did”."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43 Jerry and Esther laughed at our explanation, because they’d already moved from one hotel to another for the very same reason. “But what should we do?” they asked. We encouraged them to purchase a new notebook and right boldly across the front cover of it: My book of positive aspects . And on the first page of the book right: positive aspects of this hotel in Austin . And so, Esther began to write: It’s a beautiful facility. It’s immaculate. It’s very well situated, it’s close to the interstate, it’s easy to find. There are many different sized rooms to accommodate our increasing numbers. The hotel staff is friendly. And as Esther was making those entries, her feeling about the hotel changed from one of negative to one of positive. And in the moment that she began to feel better, her attraction from the hotel changed. She did not write, “ They’re always ready and waiting for us” , because that had not been her experience, and writing that would have evoked a feeling of contradiction, or a feeling of defense, or a feeling of justification from her. But by wanting to feel good, and by deliberately focusing her attention more upon the things about the hotel that did feel good, Esther’s point of attraction regarding the hotel shifted. And then something Esther found very interesting happened – the hotel never forgot they were coming again. Esther was amused to realize that the hotel had not been forgetting about their agreement because they were uncaring or disorganized, the staff was simply being influenced by her dominant thought about them. In short, they could not buck the current of Esther’s negative thought. Esther enjoyed her Book of positive aspects so much that she began writing pages on many subjects of her life. We encouraged her to not only write about the things in which she was seeking improved feelings, but to write about things she already felt mostly positive about, just to get in the habit of good-feeling thoughts and for the pleasure of good-feeling thoughts. It’s a nice way to live. 34. The Law of Attraction adds power to thoughts Often when experiencing an unwanted situation, you feel a need to explain why it has happened in an attempt, perhaps, to justify why you’re in the situation. Whenever you’re defending, or justifying, or rationalizing, or blaming anything or anyone, you remain in a place of negative attraction. Every word you speak as you explain why something is not the way you want it to be continues the negative attraction, for you cannot be focused upon what you do want while you’re explaining why you’re experiencing something that you do not want. You cannot be focused upon"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44 negative aspects and positive aspects at the same time. Often in an attempt to determine where your trouble started, you only hold yourself in that negative attraction longer. “What’s the source of my trouble? What’s the reason that I am not where I want to be?” It’s natural that you want improvement in your experience, and therefore it’s logical that you’re solution oriented. But there is a big difference between seriously looking for a solution and justifying the need for a solution by emphasizing the problem. The realization that something is not as you want it to be is an important first step. But once you’ve identified that, the faster you’re able to turn your attention in the direction of a solution, the better, because a continuing exploration of the problem will prevent you from finding the solution. The problem is a different vibrational frequency than the solution. As you become aware of the value of the process of pivoting, and as you become adept at identifying what is not wanted, and then immediately turn your attention toward what is wanted, you will realize that you’re surrounded primarily by wonderful things, for there is so much more that is going right in your world than wrong. Also, a daily utilization of the Book of positive aspects will help you to become more positively oriented. It will assist you in gradually tipping the balance of your thoughts more in the direction of what you do want. The more that you focus your attention with the intention of finding increasingly better-feeling thoughts, the more you will realize that there is a very big difference between thinking about what you want and thinking about the absence of it. Whenever you’re feeling uncomfortable as you’re speaking or thinking about improving something you want, such as a better financial condition or an improved relationship or physical condition, you’re in that moment preventing yourself from finding the improvement. The process of pivoting and the process of the Book of positive aspects are both offered to assist you in recognizing in the early subtle stages of your creation that you are pulling on the very tips of that negative ball of twine, so that you may right away release it and reach for the positive thread of thought instead."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"45 It is much easier to go from a thought of something that makes you feel a little better to an even better feeling thought to an even better feeling thought than to go directly to a wonderful feeling thought, because all thoughts, or vibrations, are affected, or managed, by Law of Attraction. 35. I’ll begin my day with good feeling thoughts When you’re focused upon something that you really do not want, it is actually easier for you to remain focused upon that unwanted topic, even finding other evidence to support that thought, than it is to move to a more positive perspective, because thoughts that are like unto themselves are drawn. So, if you attempt to make a big jump from a truly negative unwanted topic immediately to a positive delightful topic of something that you do want, you will not be able to make the jump, for there’s too much vibrational disparity between the two thoughts. A determination to gently, generally and steadily lean more and more in the direction of wanted things is really the best way to approach your personal vibrational improvement. When you first awaken in the morning after a few hours of sleep, and therefore a vibrational detachment from unwanted things, you are in your most positive vibrational state. If you would begin your day, even before you get out of bed, by looking for a handful of positive aspects in your life, you will begin your day in a more positive vane, and the thoughts that the LOA will now provide as your springboard into each day will be much better feeling and beneficial. In other words, every morning you have an opportunity to establish another vibrational basis, a sort of set point, that sets the general tone of your thoughts for the rest of the day. And while it is possible that some events of your day may deviate from that starting place, in time you will see that you have established complete control of your thoughts, of your vibration, of your point of attraction, of your life. 36. Sleep time is realignment of Energies time While you’re sleeping, or during the time that you’re not consciously focused through your physical body, the attraction to your physical body stops. Sleep is a time when your Inner-Being can realign your energies, and it is a time for refreshment and replenishment of your physical body."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46 If, when you put yourself in your bed, you will say, “Tonight I will rest well. I know that all attraction to this body will stop, and when I awaken in the morning I will literally re-emerge back into my physical experience “, you will receive the greatest benefit from your time of sleep. Awakening in the morning is not so different from being born. It’s not so different form the day you first emerged into your physical body. So, as you awaken, open your eyes and say, “Today I will look for reasons to feel good. Nothing is more important than that I feel good. Nothing is more important than that I choose thoughts that attract other thoughts that attract other thoughts that raise my vibrational frequency to the place where I can resonate with the positive aspects of the Universe.” You see, your vibration is right where you last left it. So, if you lie in your bed worrying about a situation before you go to sleep, when you wake up you will pick up right where your thoughts or vibration left off the night before, and then your thoughts for the day will get off on that negative footing. And then the LOA will continue to serve up for you other thoughts that are like those thoughts. But if you will make an effort as you go to sleep to identify some of the positive aspects of your life, and then deliberately release your thoughts as you remember that during your slumber you’re going to detach and refresh, and then if when you awaken you will open your eyes and say, “Today I will look for reasons to feel good”, you will begin to gain control of your thoughts and life. Rather than worrying about the problems of the world, or thinking about things that you have to do today, just lie in your bed and look for the positive aspects of the moment: how wonderful this bed feels, how comforting the fabric feels, how good my body feels, how comfortable this pillow is, how refreshing the air is that I am breathing, how good it is to be alive. You will have begun to pull on that positive good feeling rope. The LOA is like a giant magnifying glass, amplifying whatever is. And so, as you awaken and look for some reasons, something very immediate to you, to feel good about, the LOA will then offer you another thought that feels like that, and then another, and then another, and that really is what we call getting out of bed on the right foot. With a little bit of effort and a desire to feel good you can redirect your thoughts to more and more pleasing scenarios, until you will change your habits of thought as well as your point of attraction. And the evidence of your improvement in thought will begin to show up right away."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47 37. An example of a positive aspects bedtime process Your action orientation in life causes you to believe that it takes hard work to make things happen. But as you learn to deliberately direct your thoughts, you will discover that there is tremendous leverage and power in thought. As you focus more consistently only in the direction of what you desire, rather than diluting the power of your thought by thinking of the wanted and then the unwanted, you will understand from your personal experience what we mean. Because of your action orientation you often try too hard and work too hard, and as a result of that most of you bring yourselves more to the attention of what is wrong, or more to the attention of what needs to be fixed, than you do to the attention of what you desire. Here is a good way to apply the process of positive aspects at bedtime: Once you’re in your bed, try to recall some of the most pleasant things that happened during the day. Since many things have undoubtedly happened during this day, you may have to ponder for a little while, and you may remember some of the less than pleasant things that happened. But stick to your intention of finding something pleasing. And when you find it, ponder it. Prime your positive pomp by saying things such as, “The thing I liked about that was,,”, or “My favorite part of that was..” And then follow any positive thread that you find, thinking about the best parts of your day. And then, once you’re feeling the effect of your positive thoughts, focus on your dominant intention right now, which is getting a good night sleep and awakening refreshed in the morning. Say to yourself, “I am going to sleep now, and while I am sleeping, because my thoughts will be inactive, attraction will stop and my physical body will be completely refreshed at every level.” Turn your attention to the immediate things around you, like the comfort of your bed or the softness of your pillow – the Well-Being of your moment. And then softly set forth the intention, “I will sleep well, and I will awaken refreshed with another new good feeling positive point of attraction.” And then off to sleep you go."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48 38. An example of a positive aspects morning process As you awaken the next morning, you will be in that positive good feeling place, and your first thoughts will be something like, “Ah, I’m awake! I’ve re-emerged back into the physical.” Lie there for a little while and bask in the comfort of your bed, and then offer a thought such as, “Today, no matter where I’m going and no matter what I’m doing, no matter who I’m doing it with, it is my dominant intent to look for things that feel good. When I feel good, I’m vibrating with my Higher Power. When I feel good, I’m in harmony with that which I consider to be good. When I feel good, I’m in the mode of attracting that which will please me once it gets here. And when I feel good, I feel good. It’s just good to feel good. If the only thing it ever brought you is the way you feel in the moment. Ah, but feeling good brings ever so much more beyond that.” We would lie in the bed for 2 or 3 minutes. That is enough. And we would look for positive aspects of our surroundings. And then, as we move into the day, we would begin to acknowledge more positive aspects, looking for more reasons to feel good, no matter what the object of our attention is. In the first moment of any negative emotion, which will very likely occur, even though you’ve begun your day looking for reasons to feel good, because there is upon some subjects some negative momentum already in motion, so don’t worry about it, but upon the first inclination of any negative emotion, we would stop and say, “I want to feel good. I’m feeling some negative emotion, which means that I’m focusing upon something that I do not want. Now, what is it that I want?” And then we would turn our attention immediately to that which we want. Staying focused upon the new thought or the positive thought long enough that we could feel the positive energy again beginning to flow through our body. As you move through your day, look for more reasons to laugh and more reasons to have fun. When you want to feel good and you do not take things so seriously, and when you are not taking things so seriously, you’re not as likely to notice the lack of things wanted, and when you’re not focused upon the lack of what you desire, you just feel better. And when you feel better, you attract more of what you do want., and your life just gets better and better and better. And then that night as you lie in your bed, you’ll have many wonderful things to ponder as you drift off into your restful refreshing sleep. And then you’ll awaken into an even better feeling new day tomorrow."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"49 39. I know how I want to feel Sometimes, when you’re in the midst of an uncomfortable situation, you struggle to find any positive aspects within it. Some things are intolerable. Some things are so big and so bad, that it does not seem possible for you to find anything positive about it. But that is because you’re attempting to take too large of a jump from the awfulness of what you’re focused upon to the solution that you desire. In other words, if you want to find an action solution right now that will fix this, but you find yourself in a situation where no action that you can take seems appropriate, always remember that while there may not be a positive aspect to your action in this moment, and while you may not be able to figure out what to do that would make you feel better, you always do know how you want to feel. It’s a bit like someone saying, “I’ve just jumped out of an airplane and I have no parachute. What shout I do now?” There are situations where, given the current circumstances, there is no action or thought that at this point will make a significant enough difference to change the outcome that’s barreling in upon you. And in the same way that sometimes you cannot find any action that will fix things, there’s no thought that will immediately change it either. But if you understand the power of your thought, and the incredible leverage that consistently good feeling thoughts provide, and you begin deliberately choosing your thoughts by utilizing the guidance that your feelings or emotions are indicating to you, you can easily transform your life into predominantly good feeling experiences by focusing upon the improved feeling. If you’re able to find even the smallest feeling of relief in a deliberately chosen thought, your gentle path toward your solution will begin. What to do in certain situations may not by clear to you, and you may at times not even be able to identify what it is that you want to have, but there’s never a time that you are unable to identify to some extent how you want to feel. In other words, you know that you would rather feel happy than sad, you know you’d rather be refreshed than tired, or invigorated rather than enervated. You know that you would rather feel productive than unproductive. You know that you would rather feel free than confined, and growing rather than stagnant. There is not enough action available to compensate for misaligned thought. But when you begin to gain control of the way you feel, by more deliberately choosing the direction of your thought, you will discover the powerful leverage in thought. If you will bring yourself to a more deliberate"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"50 control of your own thought, you will bring yourself to a more deliberate control of your own life experience. 40. Nothing is more important than feeling good Becoming more deliberate about the things you think is not a difficult thing. You’re often particular about what you eat, or the vehicle you drive, or the clothes you wear, and being a deliberate thinker does not require much more deliberate discrimination than that. But learning to deliberately direct your thoughts toward the aspect of the subject that feels best to you will have a much greater impact on the improvement of your life than the choosing of a meal or of a vehicle or of clothing. Once you read these words and feel your own personal resonance with their meaning and power, you’ll never again feel negative emotion without realizing that you’re receiving important guidance to assist you in guiding your thoughts in a more productive and beneficial direction. In other words, you will never again feel negative emotion and not understand that it means you’re in the process of attracting something unwanted. A significant thing is happening with you as you’re coming into conscious awareness of your emotions and the guidance that they provide. Because even in your ignorance of what negative emotion meant, you were still negatively attracting. And so, understanding your emotion now gives you control of your life experience. When you’re feeling less than good, if you’ll stop and say, “Nothing is more important than that I feel good. I want to find a reason now to feel good”, you will find an improved thought, which will lead to another and another. And as you develop the habit of looking for good feeling thoughts, the circumstances that surround you must improve, the LOA demands it. When you feel good, you experience a sensation of doors opening as the Universe is cooperating with you. And when you feel bad, it feels as if doors are closing, and the cooperation stops. Anytime you feel negative emotion, you’re in the mode of resisting something that you want, and that resistance takes its toll on you. It takes its toll on your physical body, and it takes its toll on the wonderful things that you are allowing to come into your experience. Through your process of living life and noticing things wanted and unwanted, you’ve created a sort of vibrational escrow, which in a sense holds for you those wanted things you’ve identified, until you become a close enough vibrational match to them that you allow yourself a fully manifested"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"51 receiving of them. But until you find a way to feel good about them, even though they have not yet manifested in your experience, it may seem to you that they’re on the outside of a door that you cannot open. However, as you begin to look for more positive aspects regarding the things that occupy your thoughts, and as you deliberately choose the more positive end of the stick of possibilities, regarding the subjects that dominate your thought processes, that door will open and everything that you desire will flow easily into your experience. 41. It gets better the better it gets When you deliberately seek positive aspects of whatever you are giving your attention to, you, in a sense, tune your vibrational tuner to more positive aspects of everything. And, of course, you could tune yourself negatively as well. Many people struggle in an attitude of self-criticism as a result of negative comparison that has been directed to them from parents or teachers or peers, and there’s nothing more detrimental to your ability to positively attract than a negative attitude toward yourself. So, sometimes by choosing a subject about which you’ve practiced fewer negative thoughts, you can tune yourself to a better feeling frequency, and then from that better feeling place, as you redirect your thoughts toward yourself, you will find more positive aspects about yourself than usual. Once you find more positive aspects of the world that surrounds you, you will begin to find more positive aspects about yourself. And when that happens, finding more positive aspects about your world will be easier still. When you find things about yourself that you do not like, you will find more of those things in others. You say, “The worse it gets the worse it gets”. But as you are deliberately looking for positive aspects in yourself or in others, you will find more of those things: \"The better it gets, the better it gets\". We cannot overemphasize the value in looking for positive aspects and focusing upon more of things wanted, because everything that comes to you is dependant upon that very simple premise: you get more and more of what you are thinking about—whether you want it or not. 42. My Universe is positively and negatively balanced So, you are the creator of your experience. Or you could say that you’re the attractor of your experience. Creating is not about identifying something wanted and then going after it and capturing it. Creating is about focusing upon the subject of desire, tuning your thoughts more"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"52 precisely to the aspects of the subject that you would like to experience, and therefore allowing the LOA to bring it to you. Whether you’re remembering something from the past, imagining something about the future, or observing something from your now, you’re offering thought vibrations that the LOA is responding to. You may refer to your thoughts as desires or beliefs (a belief is only a thought that you keep thinking), but whatever you’re giving your attention to is establishing your point of attraction. Because every subject is actually two subjects – what is wanted and the lack of what is wanted – it’s possible to believe that you’re positively focused, when in fact you’re negatively focused. A person may say, “I want more money”, but what they’re actually focused upon is the fact that they don’t have as much money as they need. Most people talk most often about their desire to be healthy when they’re feeling sick. In other words, their attention to what they do not want is what is prompting their remarks about what they do want. But in the majority of cases, even though they may be speaking words that seem to indicate that they’re focused upon their desire, they are not. It’s only by consciously recognizing how you’re feeling while you’re speaking that you really know if you’re positively or negatively attracting. And while you may not see immediate evidence of what you’re in the process of attracting, whatever you’re thinking about is amassing matching thoughts and vibrations and energies. And eventually the evidence of your attraction will be obvious. 43. My Universe responds to my attention to.. Most people believe, or would like to believe, that everything in the Universe responds to their words in the same way that other people around them can sometimes be trained to behave. When you tell someone, “Yes, come to me”, you expect them to come. When you say, “No, go away from me”, you expect them to go. But you live in an attraction based Universe, an inclusion based Universe, which simply means, there’s no such thing as “No”. When you give your attention to something wanted and you say, “Yes, come to me”, you include it in your vibration, and the LOA begins the process of bringing it. But when you look at something unwanted and you say, “No, I do not want you. Go away!”, the Universe brings that also. Your attention to it, and therefore your vibrational alignment with it is what’s causing the response, not your words. And so, as you say, “Perfect health, I seek you, I want you. I bask in the idea of perfect health”, you’re attracting health. But as you say, “Sickness, I do not want you”, you’re attracting sickness. As you say, “No, no, no!”, it’s coming closer closer closer, because the more you struggle against something that you do not want, the more engulfed in it you become."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"53 People often believe that once they find their perfect mate or achieve their perfect body weight, or accumulate enough money, then once and for all they will find the happiness that they seek. But nowhere is there a little corner of something where only positive aspects exist. The perfect balance of the Universe says that positive and negative, wanted and unwanted exists in all particles of the Universe. When you as the creator, the chooser, the definer, the decider, when you look for positive aspects, that becomes what you live in all aspects of your life. You don’t have to wait around for that perfect thing to show itself to you so that you can then have a positive response to it, instead you can positively train your thoughts and vibrations. And then you will become the attractor of it, or the creator of it. We would encourage you to begin each day with the statement: “Today, no matter where I go, no matter what I’m doing, and no matter who I’m doing it with, it is my dominant intent to look for what I’m wanting to see.” Remember, when you awaken in the morning, you are reborn. While you have slumbered, all attraction has stopped. That sequestering away for a few hours of sleep, where your consciousness is no longer attracting, gives you a refreshing new beginning. And so, unless you wake up in the morning and begin regurgitating what troubled you the day before, it will not trouble you in your new day, in your new birth, in your new beginning. 44. Decisions to feel good attract good feelings A woman said to us, when she found out that she was going to be attending some holiday parties, she said, “As soon as I heard that I was going, I started thinking, “Oh, Mary is going to be there. She’s going to look so gorgeous””. She realized that just the idea of the party was causing her to compare herself to other people. And she said to us, “I want to stop doing that. I want to feel good about me, and just enjoy the parties no matter who is there”. She asked us if we could help her with the process of pivoting and positive aspects. She knew she was feeling self-conscious and didn’t know what to do about it. She said, “I don’t even want to go to the parties”. We said to her, “While your feeling of self-consciousness is amplified, as you think about going to these parties, it’s not Mary who is the reason for your discomfort”. It often feels very complicated to sort out your relationships with other people. Sometimes you even try to trace those feelings back to your childhood. But there really is no point in doing that. You have the ability from right where you stand right now to find positive or negative aspects, to think of wanted or unwanted. And whether you begin the process now or several days before you go to"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"54 the party, or whether you wait until you’re at the party, your work is still the same: you must look for things that feel good when you focus upon them. Because you have more control over what’s activated in your own mind, it is usually much easier to find the positive aspects of a situation before you’re standing right in the middle of it. So, if you do imagine the situation as you want it to be, and you take the time to practice your positive response to the upcoming situation, then when you’re at the party, you will witness the control that you set into motion days before, before you were at the party. You cannot feel good and bad at the same time. You can’t focus upon wanted and unwanted at the same time. So, if you’ve trained your thoughts to what you consider to be good or wanted before you arrive at the party, the LOA will deliver to you things that feel good and are wanted. It really is as simple as that. We said to our friend, if you want to feel different at these upcoming parties than you’ve felt at the parties in previous years, you have to begin telling a different story. The story you’ve been telling goes something like: “I’m only invited to these parties because of my relationship with my mate. It really is not important to anyone that I be there. I’m not really a part of his work environment, and I don’t really understand most of the things that they are interested in. I’m like an outsider. Mary doesn’t feel like an outsider like I do. Her confidence is obvious in the way she dresses and carries herself. I always feel less attractive and less smart, less everything when I’m near Mary. I hate feeling like this. I wish I didn’t have to go.” We told our friend, here’s an example of a better feeling story: “My mate is well respected at his firm. It’s nice that his company occasionally provides an opportunity for people who work there to include their spouses to get to know one another. No one there expects me to be up to speed with the inner workings of that environment. In fact, this is a party where they will probably enjoy thinking about things other than their work. Life’s much larger than what happens at my husband’s office. And since I’m never there, I may very well appear to be a breath of fresh air to many of them, because I’m not bogged down in the things that they’re troubled about. Mary seems light and friendly. She’s clearly not bogged down in office politics or problems. It’s fun to watch her. She’s interesting. I wonder where she buys her clothes. Very pretty things she wears.”"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"55 We wanted our friend to see that it’s not necessary to sort out every insecurity that she’d ever felt and use this office party as a means to solve it. We told her, “Just find something positive to focus upon, and feel the benefit of having done so. And in time Mary, or all the Maries, will be a non- issue. In fact, Mary could become your friend. But in any case, it’s your decision to make. You just have to vibrationally practice it to make it so”. 45. How can I not feel their pain? Our friend Jerry said to us that it seemed to him that the majority of his discomfort is because of observing others who are in discomfort or in pain. And he wanted to know how he could use the pivoting process to not feel pain about their pain. We explain that whatever the subject of your attention, it contains things that you want to see as well as things that you do not want to see. If you’re feeling pain, it is not because the person that you’re observing is in pain, your pain is because you’ve chosen to look at an aspect of them that causes you to feel pain. And there’s a big difference. Of course, if this person were not feeling pain, but were instead joyful, it would be easier for you to feel joyful. But you must not rely on conditions changing in order to control the way you feel. You must improve your ability to focus positively regardless of the condition. And to do that, it helps to remember that every subject has wanted and unwanted within it. And, if you’re deliberate, you can find something that feels better. Of course, it is easier just to observe something that’s right before your eyes, than it is to deliberately sift for things that you would prefer to see. However, when it really matters to you that you feel good, you’ll be less willing to merely lazily or sloppily observe, because your desire to feel good will inspire a greater willingness to look for positive aspects. Also, the more you do look for good feeling things to focus upon, the more of those kinds of good feeling things the LOA will bring to you. Until in time you’ll be so positively oriented that you simply will not notice the things that don’t match your positive orientation. We were visiting with a mother at one time, and we encouraged her to just ignore her son’s problems. And she said, “But won’t he feel like I’ve abandoned him? Don’t I need to be there for him?” And we explained to her that there is no abandonment in focusing upon the positive aspects of someone’s life. And there is powerful value in abandoning any thoughts that do not feel good when you think them. We told her, you will never help anyone by being their sounding board for"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"56 problems or complaints. By holding an image of improvement in your son’s life you help him move toward that. Be there for him. Call him there to that better feeling place. When it’s your deliberate intention to feel good, and you really care about how you feel, you’ll find more and more thoughts about more and more subjects that do feel good. And then you will be better prepared to interface with others who could be feeling good or bad. Because of your desire to feel good you will have prepaved your experience with others with whom you will be interacting. And then it will be much easier for you to focus positively about their situation no matter what sort of mess they’re in. But if you’ve not been tending to your own vibration and you’ve not been consistently holding yourself in good feeling thoughts and vibrations, then you may be swept away into their situation, and you may very well feel discomfort. We just want to emphasize that you’re not feeling their pain caused by their situation, but instead you’re feeling your own pain, brought about by your own thinking. There’s great control in that understanding, and, if fact, true freedom. When you discover that you can control the way you feel because you can control the thoughts you think, then you are free to joyously move about your Planet. But when you believe that the way you feel is dependant upon the behavior or situations of others, and you also understand that you have no control over those behaviors or situations, you do not feel free. That, in fact, was the pain that our friend Jerry was describing. 46. My sympathy is of no value to anyone So then Jerry said to us, “So, when I take my attention off those who are in trouble, I’ll feel good, but still that doesn’t help them feel better. In other words, I haven’t solved the problem, I’m just avoiding the problem”. And we told him, “If you don’t focus upon their problem, you can continue to feel good. But they’ll still have the problem, that is true, at first. But if you do focus upon their problem, you’ll feel bad, they’ll continue to feel bad, and they’ll still have the problem. And if you continue to focus upon their problem, in time you will have the problem too. However, if you don’t focus upon their problem but instead you try to imagine their solution or a positive outcome, you’ll feel good. And then there is the possibility of your influencing them to more positive thoughts and outcomes”. In simple terms, you are never of value to another and you never offer a solution when you are feeling negative emotion. Because the presence of negative emotion within you means you’re focused upon the lack of what is wanted rather than what is wanted. So, if someone is having a bad experience and they come into your awareness with a powerful wind of negativity rapped around"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"57 them, if you have not already deliberately achieved your alignment with feeling food, you may be swept into their negativity, you may become part of their chain of pain, and you may very well then pass your discomfort onto another who will then pass it onto another, and so on. But if you have been deliberately setting the tone of your day, but putting your head on your pillow each night and saying, “Tonight, as I sleep, all attraction will stop, which means tomorrow I will have a new beginning, and tomorrow I will look for what I’m wanting to see, because I want to feel good, because feeling good is the most important thing”, as you awaken in the morning, you will be upon a fresh path, bringing no negativity from the day before. And then, as you walk into a room and you see someone with pain coming toward you, as this person comes with his pain, you don’t become part of it, but instead you provide a better example of happiness. For that which you feel is that which you radiate. Now, it’s not likely that just because you remain happy, others will immediately join you in your happiness. In fact, when there’s a great disparity between the way you are feeling and the way others are feeling, you will have a difficult time relating to one another. But in time, if you maintain your positive vibrational stance, they will either join you in your positive place, or they will vibrate right out of your experience. The only way unhappy people can stay in your experience is by your continuing attention to them and their unhappiness. If you and two other people were walking along a mountain ledge, and you were not watching where you were going and you stumbled and fell over the edge, and you were hanging by a very flimsy vine, and one of your friends was very strong and surefooted, and the other was very clumsy and not focused, which one would you be glad was there? Looking for the positive aspects is the way you find your surefooting. It is who-you-are from an Inner perspective. And as you consistently align with increasingly better feeling thoughts, the powerful resources of the Universe become available to you. To sympathize with another means to focus upon their situation until you feel as they feel. And since everyone has the potential of feeling wonderful or feeling awful, of succeeding at their desires or of failing at their desires, you have options abut which aspects of them you sympathize with. We encourage you to sympathize with the best feeling aspects of others that you can find. And in doing so, you may influence them to an improved condition also."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"58 47. To not hurt when they feel hurt A man once asked us, “How do you end a relationship without being hurt by the other person being hurt? If you decide that it’s time to move on, and the other person is not ready to move on, so he or she is distraught, how can you keep your balance in a situation like that?” And we said to him, when you attempt to guide your behavior by paying attention to how someone else feels about your behavior, you’re powerless. Because you cannot control their perspective, and therefore you cannot achieve any consistent improvement in your own vibration or point of attraction or how you feel. If you’ve decided to take the action of leaving a relationship before you’ve done the vibrational work of focusing upon what you want and why you want it, any action that you take can only bring you more of the same discomfort that you’ve been experiencing. And even once the relationship is ended and you’re alone or beginning another relationship with another person, those old lingering negative vibrations will not allow a pleasant unfolding. In other words, it’s so much better to find your vibrational balance before you take the action of separation, or you may experience a rather long time of discomfort. We told our friend, let’s examine the components of the situation and bring some clarity to your options. You’ve come to the conclusion, as a result of being unhappy in this relationship for a while, that it would be better to end it. In other words, you believe that your chance of happiness is greater outside of the relationship than inside it. But when you announce that to your partner, your partner becomes even more unhappy. And now because your partner is more unhappy, you are more unhappy. One option is to stay. To say, “Never, mind, don’t be unhappy. I’ve changed my mind. I’ll stay”. But all that has happened is that you were both feeling unhappy, you made a decision to leave, which made your partner even more unhappy, and now you’ve pulled back from that decision, so your partner is not quite as unhappy as before, but still neither of you are happy. So nothing has changed except that things got a bit more intense for a while. But basically, you’re still unsatisfied and unhappy in this relationship. Another option is to just leave. You could focus upon all of the things that have caused you to feel uncomfortable in the relationship and use those things as your justification for leaving, and while that negative focus upon negative things will give you the conviction to take the action of leaving, you will really not feel that much better. While you may feel some relief from the intensity of your unhappiness once you’re on the outside of the relationship, you’ll continue to feel a need to justify your action of leaving, which will continue to hold you in an unpleasant state. So, even though you’ve walked away from the things that were really bothering you, you’ll still feel bothered."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"59 Really, there is nothing that you can do to prevent others from feeling bad, because they don’t feel bad because of your behavior. There is no greater entrapment in relationship or in life than an attempt to keep others happy by observing their emotions and then trying to compensate with your actions. The only way you can be happy is to decide to be happy. When you take upon yourself the responsibility of someone else’s happiness, you’re attempting the impossible and you’re setting yourself up for a great deal of personal discord. So now let’s consider the options of pivoting and positive aspects. Stay where you are for now, making no big change in your action or behavior. In other words, if you’re living together, continue to do so; if you’re spending time together, continue to do so. This option is a change in your thought process, not your action process. The process of pivoting and the process of positive aspects are designed to help you focus differently and to begin telling the story of your relationship or of your life in a better feeling, more self-empowering way. For example, “I’ve been thinking about leaving this relationship because I find that I am not happy within it. But as I think about leaving I realize that when I go I’ll take myself with me, and if I leave because I’m unhappy, I’ll be taking that unhappy person with me. The reason that I want to leave is because I want to feel good. I wonder if it’s possible to feel good without leaving. I wonder if there’s anything about our relationship that I could focus upon that does feel good. I remember meeting this person and how that felt. I remember feeling drawn by this person and eager to move forward to see what more we might discover together. I liked the feeling of discovery, I liked our relationship as it began. I think that the more time we spent together, the more we realized that we were not really a perfect match. I don’t believe that there is any failure on either of our parts in that. Not being a perfect match doesn’t mean that either of us is wrong. It only means that there are potentially better partners out there for each of us. There are so many things about this person that I like and that anyone would easily appreciate: so smart and interested in so many things, laughs easily, likes to have fun. I’m glad that we’ve come together. And I believe that our time together will prove to be of value to both of us”. So, our answer to this important question is, you cannot control the pain that any other feels by modifying your behavior. You can, however, control your own pain by directing your thoughts until your pain subsides and is replaced by improved feelings. As you give your attention to what you’re wanting, you will always begin to feel good. As you give your attention to the lack of what you’re wanting, you will always feel bad. And if you give your attention to the lack of what someone else is wanting, you will feel bad also."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60 You’re so action oriented as physical beings that you really think that you have to fix everything right now. Your partner did not get to this place all of a sudden, your partner did not even get there only during your relationship. It’s been a long path, momentum has been gathering along the way. So, don’t expect that a conversation that you’re having in this moment is going to make all of the difference. See yourself as one who is planting a seed, a very strong, sure, powerful seed. You’ve planted it perfectly, and you’ve nurtured it for a time with your words so that long after you’re gone that seed will continue to blossom into that which it is to be. There are many relationships that are not appropriate for you to continue. But we would never walk out of a relationship feeling angry or guilty or defensive. Do the vibrational work, get to feeling good, and then leave. And then what comes next will not be a replay of what you just left. 48. I am not responsible for others’ creations You must not accept the responsibility for what others are doing in their own life experience. See them as emerging from the lack and know that it’s going to get better for them later. And then you’ll begin to feel better. You may even inspire them in their sleep state to an improved direction. When you think about them, see them as happy. Don’t regurgitate in your mind the sad conversations you’ve had, or the parting. Instead, envision them as getting on with their life, just as you’re getting on with yours. Trust that they have the guidance within them to find their own way. What trips most of you up so often in your wanting to help others is that you believe, “They need me, because they can’t help themselves”. But that belief is detrimental to them, because down deep inside they know they can do it, and they’re wanting to do it. Begin to say things to your partner such as, “You’re such a wonderful person. And while we haven’t connected on as many levels as I would like, I know there’s a perfect partner waiting for you, and I’m releasing you to that opportunity. Look for it. I don’t want to keep you caged here, captive to something that neither one of us wants. I want to free us both to that which we both are wanting. I am not telling you goodbye forever, I’m saying, let’s let this relationship have a new understanding between us, one that’s inspired from passionate positive desire, not one that’s whipped into place because we’re afraid of the possible consequences”. And then say to the person,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61 “When I think of you, I will always know that while you’re sad now, you’re gonna be happy later. I’m gonna choose to see you as happy because that’s the way I like you best. And that’s what you like best too”. This may sound tough or cold. But nothing else makes sense. 49. Listen for guidance or reach for good feelings? You have the ability to pivot under any and all conditions. It does not matter how negative something seems, you have the ability to give your attention to the positive aspects of it. The only things that get in your way are some old habits or maybe some strong influence from others. Most people are habitual in nature. And your patterns are so well entrenched that at times the fastest path to the joy you seek is for you to take your pivot as you sleep, and then awaken in the new day already in the direction of what you’re wanting. By reaching for good feeling thoughts before you go to sleep, and then experiencing the benefit of the quite mind that occurs while you sleep, and then upon awakening immediately turning to good feeling thoughts, you can accomplish the ultimate pivoting experience. A few days of following that pattern will provide a big change in your habit of thought and your point of attraction. And you’ll discover immediate improvement in virtually every aspect of your life. 50. What if I played the What if..? game? As we encourage that you do your best to find positive aspects upon whatever subject is before you, there are often those who ask, “But what about the man who just lost his job and has a wife and five children and his rent is due in two days and he doesn’t have the money to pay it?” or, “What about the woman who has the Gestapo army at her door about to take her to be killed in a gas chamber? How could these people pivot?” And to those extreme questions we often reply, it’s as if you’ve jumped out of an airplane at an altitude of 20.000 feet and you have no parachute and so you’re saying, “Now what do I do?” You’re usually not faced with such extreme circumstances from which it seems there is no possible comfortable escape. However, these extreme situations, with all of the drama and trauma that they bring, also bring a power that, with the right focus, can provide resolutions that someone watching from the outside would find astonishing or even miraculous. In other words, there is no situation from which you cannot find a positive resolution, but you have to be able to focus powerfully in"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62 order to accomplish such a solution. And most people, who are in those kinds of situations, are not adept at that kind of focus, which is why they’re experiencing the negative situation to begin with. When you’re involved in extreme situations, a power comes forth from within, and so the intensit y of your desire will put you upon a plateau where if you can just get focused you can have your greater elevation. In other words, those who are very sick, are in a better position to be even more well than most others, because their desire for Wellness is amplified. But unless they’re able to pivot or to turn their attention to their desire for Wellness and away from their concern about illness, they cannot become well. We would encourage you to play the What if..? game, looking for positive aspects. In other words, rather than looking into your society for examples of disempowered people, having no control over the circumstances of their lives, tell a story that gives you a feeling of empowerment. Instead of telling stories of powerless victims, and amplifying your own feeling of being a victim, tell a different story. For example, What if this woman before the Gestapo army came pounding on her door had recognized the rumblings of the looming holocaust that were in the community weeks before? What if she’d left the community when many others had left? What if she had not been afraid of the unknown? What if she had not held to the familiar? What if she’d made the decision to start a new life in a new country with her sister and her aunt and uncle two weeks ago so that she was not at home when the Gestapo came calling? When you play the What if..? game, look for things you do want to see. Look for things that make you feel better. There is never a situation in which there is not a way out. In fact, there are hundreds and thousands of practical choices along the way. But out of habit most people continue to choose the lack perspective in situations, until they eventually find themselves in an unwanted place where it seems that there are no more choices. As you hold to your intention to look for evidence of Well-Being and thriving and success and happiness, you will tune yourself to the vibrations of those things. And so, those kinds of good feeling experiences will dominate your life. “Today, no matter where I am going, no matter what I am doing, it is my dominant intent to look for what I’m wanting to see”. As you make the decision that you are not a mere observer of your"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"63 world, but a deliberate positive contributor to your world, you’ll find great pleasure in your involvement with what’s going on upon your Planet. When you witness things that you do not want to happen in your world, in your nation, in your neighborhood, in your family, or even in your personal body, and you remember that you have the power to tell a different story, and you also know that there is enormous power in telling a different story, you will then step back into the exuberant knowledge that you held when you made the decision to come forth to participate on this Planet to begin with. You cannot be in a place other than where you are right now. But you do have the power to begin to express your perspective about where you are in increasingly better ways. And as you do that consciously and deliberately, you will see the evidence of the power of your focus on every subject to which you turn your attention. As you make the decision that you want to feel good, and you consciously look for positive aspects within the subjects that you’re involved in every day, and as you deliberately identify and focus upon what you do want, regarding these subjects, you’ll set yourself upon a path of eternal unfolding satisfaction and joy. These processes are simple to understand and to apply. But don’t let their simplicity cause you to underestimate their power. Consistently apply them and show yourself the leverage of the power of aligned thought. Discover the power of the Energy that creates worlds. The power that you have always had ready access to, but which you now understand how to apply and focus it toward your own personal creations."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 Part II. Attracting Money And Manifesting Abundance 51. Attracting money and manifesting abundance While money is not absolutely essential to your experience, to most people money and freedom are synonymous. And since an intense awareness of your right to be free is at the very core of that which you are, it then follows that your relationship with money is one of the most important subjects of your life experience. And so, it’s no wonder you have such strong feelings about the subject of money. Although some people have discovered the freedom of allowing large amounts of money to flow through their experience, it’s more often the case that because you’re experiencing far less money than you need or desire, most of you are not feeling free. It is our intention here to clearly explain why this financial disparity exists, so that you can begin to allow the abundance that you want and deserve into your experience. As you read these words, and as you begin to resonate with these Law based truths, you will align your desire with the abundance of your world and then the evidence of your new found alignment will soon become apparent to you and others who observe you. Whether you’re one who’s been working to achieve financial abundance for many years or you’re a youngster just starting down that path, the journey to financial Well-Being does not have to be a long one from where you are. And it does not require large amounts of time or physical effort, for we’re going to explain to you in simple and easy to understand terms how to utilize the leverage of Energy that’s available to you. We want to show you the absolute correlation between the thoughts you’ve been thinking about money, the way you feel when you think those thoughts and the money that flows into your experience. When you’re able to consciously make that correlation, and you decide to deliberately direct your thoughts accordingly, you’ll access the power of the Universe and you’ll then see how time and physical effort are rather irrelevant to your financial success. So, we’ll begin with the simple premise of your Universe and of your world – YOU GET WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT. Often people say to us, “That can’t be true, because I’ve wanted and thought about money for as long as I can remember, but I continue to struggle and not have enough money”. And what we tell them then is the most important thing for you to understand if you want to improve your financial situation - the subject of money is really two subjects: money, plenty of money, the feeling of freedom and ease that plenty of money can provide, and absence of money, not nearly enough money, the feeling of fear or disappointment that the thought of absence of money induces. Often people assume that because they’re speaking the words “I want more money”, they’re speaking positively about money. But when you’re speaking of money, or anything, and you’re feeling fear or discomfort as you speak, you’re not speaking about the subject"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"65 of money, but instead you’re speaking about the subject of not enough money. And the difference is very important because the first statement brings money, and the second holds it away. It is of value for you to become aware of how you are really thinking, and, more important, how you’re feeling about money. If you’re thinking or saying things like, “Oh, that’s a very beautiful thing, but I can’t afford it”, you’re not in the vibrational place to allow the abundance in that you desire. The feeling of disappointment that is present as you acknowledge that you cannot afford it is your indicator that the balance of your thought is pointed more toward the lack of your desire than toward the desire itself. The negative emotion that you feel as you acknowledge that you cannot afford something that you want is one way of understanding the balance of your thoughts, and the amount of abundance that you’re actually experiencing is another way of knowing it. Many people continue to perpetuate the experience of not enough in their lives simply because they don’t think beyond the reality of what they’re actually experiencing. In other words, if they’re experiencing the shortage of money, and are aware of it and speak of it often, they hold themselves in that chronic position. And so, many people protest when we explain to them the power of telling the story of their finances as they want it to be rather than as it is, because they believe that they should be factual about what’s happening. But we want you to understand that if you continue to look at what-is and speak of what-is, you will not find the improvement that you desire. You may see a parade of changing faces and places, but your life experience will essentially show no improvement. If you want to effect substantial change in your life experience, you have to offer substantially different vibrations, which means you must think thoughts that feel different as you think them. 52. Lackful action doesn‘t pay off Jerry: Abraham, many years ago I owned a motel down near El Paso, TX, and one of the wealthiest men in the United States (he was one of the multibillionaires) called me. He purchased a small resort down on the Rio Grande river, that was financially failing. And he‘d heard that I might have some useful information to help him turn it around. As we were visiting in my little coffee shop, I had a difficult time focusing on our conversation, because I just couldn‘t understand why a man, that wealthy, would be still discontent and looking for a way of making more money. I wondered why he didn‘t just sell the place at whatever price and go on about his life enjoying the money he‘d already accumulated. And I have another friend who is in multibillionaire class. We were in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, walking on the beach, a few years ago. And he was talking about some business"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 problems he was having. And it really struck me that that man, so wealthy, would have any kinds of troubles. But what I’ve learned from you, Abraham, and I’ve learned a lot from you, is that our true success in life is not about how much money we have, or about having the things, right? 53. First I‘ll find vibrational balance The things that you have and the things that you do are all meant to enhance your state of being. In other words, it‘s all about how you feel, and how you feel is all about coming into alignment with who-you-really-are. When you tend to your alignment first, then the things you gather and the actions you perform only enhance your good feeling state of being. But if you do not find that vibrational balance first, and attempt to make yourself feel better by bringing more things into your experience, or participating in more activities, in order to try to make yourself feel better, you just get further out of balance. We’re not guiding you away from accumulating things or from taking action, because all of that is an essential part of your physical experience. In other words, you intended the wonderful experience of exploring the details of your physical world in order to help you personally determine your own joyous growth and expansion. But when you try to move forward form an imbalanced footing, it’s always uncomfortable. If you’ll begin by identifying how you want to feel, or be, and then let your inspiration to accumulate or do come from that centered place, then not only will you maintain your balance, but you will now enjoy the things that you gather and the things that you do. Most people do most of their wanting from a place of lack. They want things in many cases simply because they do not have them. So the having of them does not really satisfy anything deep within them because there’s always something else that they do not have. And so it becomes a never- ending struggle to try to bring one more thing, one more thing that still will not be satisfying, into their experience. “Because I don’t have this, I want it.” And then they really think that getting it will fill the void. But that defies Law. Any action that’s taken from a place of lack is always counterproductive, and it always leads to more of a feeling of lack. The void that these people are feeling cannot be filled with things or satisfied with action, because the feeling of void is about the vibrational discord between their desires and their chronic habits of thought. Offering better feeling thoughts, telling a different story, looking for positive aspects,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67 pivoting to the subject of what you really do want, looking for positive what-ifs – that’s how you fill that void. And when you do, a most interesting thing will occur in your experience – the things you’ve wanted will begin to flood into your experience. But these things that you’ve been wanting will flood into your experience not to fill your void, because that void no longer exists, they flow in because your void no longer exists. Certainly, you will gather many magnificent things into your experience. Our message is not for you to stop wanting, having or doing. Our message is for you to want and accumulate and do from your place of feeling good. 54. Neither money nor poverty makes joy Jerry: Abraham, there‘s a saying that money doesn‘t make for a happiness. But on the other hand, I have noticed that poverty doesn’t make for a happiness either. But still it’s obvious that money isn’t the path to a happiness. So, if the idea of achieving something does bring us happiness, does that mean that the achievement is an appropriate goal for us to set? And how does a person maintain his or her feeling of happiness when reaching one’s goal is taking a lot of their time and energy? In other words, it often seems that it’s a sort of uphill climb to reach the goal, and then there is a short plateau of rest, but then an almost immediate tedious climb to achieve the next goal. In other words, how does a person keep all of the climbing toward their goals joyous, so there is not that struggle, struggle, struggle, and then, “Wow, I’ve made it!”, and then struggle, struggle, struggle, and, “Oh, here, I’ve made it again!”? Abraham: You‘re right, money is not the path to happiness, and, as you‘ve observed, poverty certainly is not the path to happiness either. It‘s so important to remember, that when you offer any action for the purpose of achieving happiness, you’re truly going about it in a backward way. Instead, use your ability to focus your thoughts and words toward things that cause you to feel better and better, and once you’ve deliberately achieved a state of happiness, not only will wonderful actions be inspired, but wonderful results must follow. Most people give the majority of their attention to whatever is happening in their experience right now, which means, if the results please them, they feel good, but if the results do not please them, they feel bad. But that’s really going about life the hard way. If you only have the ability to see what-is, then things cannot improve. You must find a way to look optimistically forward in order to achieve any improvement in your experience. When you learn how to deliberately focus your thoughts toward good-feeling things, it’s not difficult to find happiness and maintain it even before your goal has been accomplished. The feeling"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68 of struggle you were describing happens because of the continual comparison of where you are right now in relationship to the goal you’re reaching for. When you’re constantly taking score, noticing the distance that still needs to be traveled, you amplify the distance, the task, the effort, and that’s why it feels like such an uphill struggle. When you care about how you feel, and so you choose thoughts on the basis of how they feel, you then develop patterns of thought that are more forward looking. And as the LOA then responds to those better-feeling thoughts, you get more pleasing results. Struggle, struggle, struggle never leads to a happy ending. It defies Law. “When I get there then I’ll be happy” is not a productive mindset, because unless you’re happy, you can’t get there. When you decide to first be happy, then you’ll get there. 55. I am here as a joyful creator You’re not here as accumulators or regurgitators. You’re here as creators. When you’re looking toward an ending place, you exaggerate the feeling of lack between where you are now and that ending place. And that habit of thought can not only slow the progress of your creation, but can hold it apart from you indefinitely. You are the attractor of your experience. As you look for positive aspects and make an effort to find good-feeling thoughts, you will hold yourself in a place of positive attraction, and what you want will come faster. The sculptor of a work of art does not derive his greatest satisfaction from the finished piece. It is the process of creation, the sculpting of the piece that gives him pleasure. That’s the way we would like you to view your physical experience of creating – continual joyful becoming. As you focus your attention upon things that feel good, and achieve a consistently joyful state of being, you’ll then be in the position of attracting more of whatever you want. Sometimes people complain that it seems unfair that they have to become happy before things that bring them more happiness can then come to them. They believe that when they are unhappy, they need the happy events to come, but when they are already happy, then the happy events are unnecessary. But that would defy the LOA. You have to find a way of feeling the essence of what you desire before the details of that desire can come to you. In other words, you have to begin to feel more prosperous before more prosperity can come. Often people tell us that they want more money, and when we ask them what their balance of thought is about money, they tell us that they have very positive attitude about money. But as we probe a bit deeper, asking them how they feel when they sit to pay their bills, they often then realize"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69 that while they may have been attempting to sound positive about the subject, they’ve actually been feeling a great deal of worry or even fear around the subject of money. In other words, often without realizing it the majority of their thoughts about money have been on the “not enough” side of the subject rather than on the “abundance” side of the subject. 56. The power of vibrationally spending vibrational money Here’s a process that can quickly help you shift the balance of your thoughts regarding money to a place where you can begin to let more money flow easily into your experience: Put 100 dollars in your pocket and keep it with you at all times. As you move through your day, deliberately notice how many things you could exchange this money for: “I could purchase that”, “I could do that”. Someone said to us that a 100 dollars doesn’t really buy that much in today’s economy. But we explain that if you mentally spend that 100 dollars 1000 times today, you’ve vibrationally spent 100.000 dollars. That sort of positive focus will dramatically change your vibrational balance about money. This vibrational spending process will cause you to feel differently about money, and when that happens, your point of attraction will shift, and more money must flow into your experience. It is Law. Someone said to us, “I didn’t have a 100 dollars, but I put an IOU in my pocket”. And we said, that’s defeating the process, because you’re walking around with the feeling of debt in your pocket, which is exactly the opposite of what you want to do. You want to feel your prosperity. And so, even if it’s only 20 or 50 or if it’s a 1000 or 10.000 that you have in your pocket, utilize it effectively to help you notice how good things are now. Because in your acknowledgement of your prosperous now your prosperity must become more. 57. Needing money won’t attract it Jerry: Abraham, one of my greatest disappointments, as I’ve worked to help people find greater financial success, is that those who needed the money the most, had the least success with what I was teaching them, while those who needed it the least, seemed to have the most success with it. That always seemed backward to me. It seemed like those who needed it more would try harder and eventually they should have succeeded."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70 Abraham: Anyone who is in the place of lack, no matter how much action they offer, attracts more lack. In other words, the powerful feeling outweighs any action that they offer. Any action that’s offered from a place of lack is always counterproductive. Those who were not feeling need were not in a place of lack, so their action was productive. Your experience was in absolute harmony with the LOA. As is every experience. There is not a shred of evidence anywhere in the Universe that is to the contrary of this that we are speaking of. Jerry: Also, what I noticed was that those people who hadn’t achieved much success or weren’t very interested in even hearing about achieving success were people who’d been taught that to want money was evil or immoral, and that the best thing for them to do was to remain where they were, even though they were unfulfilled. Abraham: The reason that many reach a place where they say that they do not have desire is because they’ve wanted and wanted and wanted, but because they’ve not understood that every subject is two subjects, they’ve given more of their attention to the lack of what they’ve wanted than to what they want. And so, they continue to attract the lack of what they want. And then eventually they were just worn down by it. As a person begins to associate wanting with not having so much so that to want is an unpleasant experience, then he says, “I no longer want, because every time I want something, I get myself in this place of discomfort. So it’s easier for me to just not want in the first place”. 58. What if a “poor” one doesn’t feel poor? Jerry: Well, if others who are noticing you and comparing you to themselves come to the conclusion that you’re poor, but you don’t feel poor, then you wouldn’t be in a state of lack, and so you would be able to move quickly toward more abundance in that case, right? Abraham: That is correct. Others’ assessment of you has no bearing on your point of attraction. Unless you’re bothered by their assessment. Comparing your experience to the experiences of others can amplify a feeling of lack within you if you come to the conclusion that they’ve succeeded more greatly than you have, and then you activate within yourself a feeling of being less than. Also noticing a lack of prosperity in the experiences of others does not put you in a place of attracting greater prosperity for yourself, because you’ll be getting what you think about."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"71 What you draw to you or keep from you has nothing to do with what anyone else is doing. An improved feeling of prosperity, even if your current reality does not justify the feeling, will always bring more prosperity to you. Paying attention to the way you feel about money is a much more productive activity than noticing how others are doing. Allowing more money to flow into your experience requires far less than most people understand. All that’s required is that you achieve a vibrational balance in your own thoughts: if you want more money but you doubt you can achieve it, you’re not in balance; if you want more money but you believe there’s something wrong in having money, you’re not in balance; if you want more money and you’re angry at those who have more money, you’re not in balance. When you’re feeling those emotions of inadequacy, insecurity, jealousy, injustice, anger, and so on, your emotional guidance system is letting you know that you’re out of alignment with your own desire. Most people make no effort in coming into personal alignment with the subject of money. Instead, they spend years, even lifetimes, pointing out perceived injustices, attempting to define the rightness or the wrongness of the subject, and even trying to put laws in place to orchestrate the flow of money in the civilization. When a rather small effort, in comparison with the impossible attempt at controlling those outside circumstances, would yield them an enormous return. Nothing is more important than that you feel good, for when you feel good, you’re in harmony with your greater intent. Many believe that hard work and struggle are not only a requirement to achieve success, but that working hard and struggling long is a more honorable way of living life. Those hard times of struggle certainly do help you in the defining of what you desire. But until you release the feeling of struggle, what you desire cannot come into your experience. Often people feel as if they need to prove their worthiness, and that once that is accomplished, then and only then will rewards be given. But we want you to know that you’re already worthy. And that proving yourselves worthy is not only not possible, but not necessary. What is necessary for you to receive the rewards or benefits that you seek is alignment with the essence of those benefits. You have to first bring yourself into vibrational alignment with the experience you wish to live. We know that words do not teach, and that our knowledge regarding the Laws of the Universe and of your value do not necessarily mean that now you’ve read our words that you know your value. However, as you consider the premises that we are laying out for you here, and as you begin the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72 application of the processes that we’re suggesting here, it’s our knowing that the Universe’s response to your improved vibration will give you the evidence of the existence of these Laws. It will not be long and it will not require much deliberate application of what you’re hearing here before you will be convinced of your own value and of your ability to create whatever you desire. The primary reason that people do not believe in their own value is because they often have not found a way to get what they want, so they incorrectly assume that someone outside of them does not approve, and that somehow withholding the reward. That is never true. You are the creator of your experience. Make statements, such as, “I want to be the best that I can be. I want to do and have and live in a way that’s in harmony with my idea of the greatest good. I want to harmonize physically here in this body with that which I believe to be the best or the good way of life.” If you’ll make those statements and then don’t take action unless you feel good, you will always be moving upon the path in harmony with your idea of that which is good. 59. What is my financial abundance story? A belief in lack is the reason that more people are not allowing themselves the financial abundance they desire. When you believe that there is a finite pile of abundance, and that there’s not enough to go around, and so you feel injustice when someone has more than others, believing that because they have it, others are deprived of having it, you’re holding yourself apart from abundance. It’s not another’s achievement of success that’s responsible for your lack of achievement, but rather your negative comparison and your attention to the lack of your own desire. When you feel the negative emotion that you feel as you accuse others of injustice or of squandering wealth or hording, or when you simply believe that there’s not enough to go around, you hold yourself in the position of denying your own improved condition. What anyone else has or does not have has nothing to do with you. The only thing that affects your experience is the way you utilize the Non-Physical Energy with your thought. Your abundance or lack of it in your experience has nothing to do with what anyone else is doing or having. It has only to do with your perspective. It has only to do with your offering of thought. If you want your fortune to shift, you have to begin telling a different story."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"73 Many people criticize those who are living well, who accumulate land and money and things. And that criticism is symptomatic of their own lackful habit of thought. They want to feel better and often believe that if they can make that which they are unable to achieve wrong, then they will feel better. But they never do feel better, because their attention to lack perpetuates lack everywhere they look. They would not feel uncomfortable in seeing someone else’s achievement if that desire for achievement were not present within themselves as well. And that criticism that they often keep alive within themselves only serves to hold them in vibrational discord with what they want. In other words, if someone called you on the telephone and said, “Hello, you don’t know me. I’m just calling to tell you that I’ll never call you again”, you would not feel negative emotion about the caller’s absence from your life, because his presence was not something that you desired to begin with. But if someone you care about were to make that announcement to you, you would feel strong negative emotion, because your desire and your belief would then be at odds. When you feel negative emotion about anything, it always means that you have a desire that has been born from your personal life experience that you are right now opposing with other thoughts. Vibrational discord is always the reason for negative emotion. And negative emotion is always guidance to help you redirect your thoughts to find vibrational alignment with who-you-really-are and with your current desires. 60. What if the poor criticize the rich? Jerry: Abraham, when I was a kid, I associated with poor people primarily. And we used to make fun of those who were wealthy. We criticized those who drove luxury cars, for instance. And so, as an adult, when it came time that I would like to have owned a “Cadillac”, I couldn’t bring myself to drive one, because I felt that people would now make fun of me as I’d made fun of the others. So, I drove a “Mercedes”, because years ago people kind of thought they were economy cars. But the only way I could bring myself to drive a “Cadillac”, which I finally did, was to bridge my thoughts by saying, “Well, by buying this car I put all these people to work who put this car together. I created jobs for all the people who supplied the parts and the materials: the leather, the metal, the glass, and so on”. And in that justification then I was able to buy the car. So, somehow I discovered a process of bridging my thoughts that helped me to allow that symbol of success into my experience. Abraham: Your process of bridging thoughts is an effective one."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"74 When you want to feel good and you gradually find increasingly better-feeling thoughts, you’re bringing yourself into alignment with your desire and you’re releasing the resistance that is preventing your improved conditions. Focusing on opposing opinions of others is never productive because it always causes discord within you, which also prevents your improved condition. There will always be others who disagree with you, and your attention to them will always cause you to vibrationally disagree with your own desires. Listen to your own guidance system by paying attention to how you’re feeling in order to determine the appropriateness of your desires and behaviors. There will always be someone, no matter which side of any subject you choose, who does not harmonize with you. And that’s why we speak so firmly and want so much for you to understand that your greatest endeavor is to find harmony with who-you-really-are. If you would trust in yourself, if you could believe that through all that you’ve lived you’ve come to a place of very strong knowing, and that you can trust the way you feel as your personal form of guidance about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of what you’re contemplating doing, then you would utilize your guidance system in the way that it was really intended. 61. What if our money loses value? Jerry: Abraham, in the past our money was primarily coins, metal that had a value in and of itself, like the 20 dollar gold piece - the gold itself was worth 20 dollars, and the silver in the silver dollar had value. And so, it seems simple to understand the value of the coin. But now our money in and of itself has no actual value. In other words, the paper and coins are essentially valueless. I’ve always appreciated the convenience of money as a way of exchanging goods and talents rather than trading, let’s say, a chicken for a container of milk or for a basket of potatoes. But now our money is being artificially devalued. And it’s becoming increasingly difficult to really understand the value of a dollar. In other words, it reminds me of my own searching for my own value, like how much is my talent worth? How much should I ask for an exchange for the time and energy that I put forth? But now I’m learning from you that we don’t have to consider our value in that way. We only have to consider what it is we want and then to allow it in. I’m aware that many people are feeling insecure about their financial future, because they feel they don’t have control over what may happen to the value of the dollar, because it’s typically just a handful of people who seem to control or manipulate that. Many worry that there’s going to be more inflation or even another depression. I’d like people to understand what you’ve been teaching us about the LOA, so that they won’t be concerned with things that are outside their control, like the value of the dollar."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"75 Abraham: You’ve hit upon something very essential here, regarding the subject of money, because you’re right, many of you are recognizing that the dollars today just are not worth what they were at one time. But that’s another position of lack you very often stand firmly upon that keeps you from attracting the abundance that is yours. We’d like you to understand that the dollar and its assigned value is really not as important to your experience as your believing. And that if you could put your attention upon what you’re wanting, in terms of being and then having and then doing, that all of the money or other means for bringing about what you want could then flow easily and much more effortlessly into your experience. We keep coming back to the same terminology. From your place of lack you cannot attract its opposite. And so it really is a matter of adjusting your thinking so that your thinking harmonizes with what feels good to you. Every thought that you think vibrates, and it’s by virtue of having that vibrating thought that you attract. When you think a thought of lack, that thought’s vibrating at a place that is so alien to that which your Inner-Being knows to be, that your Inner-Being cannot resonate with you at all. And the resulting feeling within you is one of negative emotion. When you think a thought of upliftment or abundance or Well-Being, those thoughts do harmonize with what your Inner-Being knows to be, and under those conditions you’re filled with a feeling of positive emotion. You can trust that the way you feel is the indicator about which side of the subject that you’re on. Whether it’s a subject of money or lack of it, or health or lack of it, or relationship or lack of it, always when you feel good you’re in the place of attracting what you’re wanting. 62. To reverse a downward spiral Jerry: When I would see people having financial problems, I used to worry about them. I would watch as they spiral down down down till they would finally come crashing down in bankruptcy. But then in a very short time they’d have another new boat, a new luxury car, and another beautiful home. In other words, no one I watched seemed to stay down. But why couldn’t they stop the downward spiral somewhere earlier along the way and start back upward sooner? Why did so many of them have to go all the way to the bottom before they could start back up again? Abraham: Well, the reason for any downward spiral is attention to lack. In their fear that they might lose something or in their attention to the things that they were losing they were focused upon the lack of what they wanted, and as long as that was their point of attention, only more loss was possible. As they felt guarded or defensive, or as they began to justify or rationalize or blame, they were on the lack side of the equation, and only more lack could be their experience. But once they"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76 hit bottom and were no longer in a place of guardedness, because there was nothing else to lose, then their attention shifted and so their vibration shifted, so their point of attraction shifted. Hitting what they believed to be the bottom caused them to begin to look up. You could say that it forced them to begin telling a different story. Your life experience has caused you to ask for many wonderful things that are making their way into your experience, but your worry or your doubt or your fear or resentment or blame or jealousy, or any number of negative emotions, would indicate that the predominate thoughts you were thinking were holding those things away. It would be as if you’d drawn them right outside your door but the door was closed. As you begin telling a different story of the things you could buy with your 100 dollar bill, as you relax and focus more upon the positive aspects of your life, as you more deliberately choose the better-feeling end of the vibrational stick, that door will open and you will be flooded with manifestations of those wanted things and experiences and relationships. 63. A war against war is war Recognizing that you the creator of your own experience and learning to deliberately do so by directing your thoughts, is an adjustment for most people, because most people believe that you make things happen through action. Not only have you believe that action is what makes things happen, but you also believe that if you apply pressure to unwanted things, they’ll go away. And although you may believe that pushing against those unwanted things will cause them to leave your experience, that’s not how the Laws of the Universe work. And that’s not the proof of your experience either, for all of those wars are getting bigger. Attention to the lack of what is wanted causes it to increase and come closer to you. Just as focusing upon what is wanted causes it to increase and come closer to you. When you relax into your natural Well-Being, when you make statements such as, “I seek abundance, and I trust the Laws of the Universe. I’ve identified the things that I want and now I’m going to relax and allow them into my experience”, more of what you desire will come. If your financial situation feels like a struggle, you’re pushing your financial Well-Being further away. But when you begin to feel ease regarding your financial situation, you’re then allowing more abundance to flow into your experience. It really is as simple as that. And so, when you see others excelling in their attraction of money, and you feel negative emotion about it, that is your signal that your current thought is not allowing the abundance that you desire into your experience. When you find yourself critical of the way anyone has attracted or is"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"77 using money, you’re pushing money away from yourself. But when you realize that what others do with money has nothing to do with you, and that your primary work is to think and speak and do what feels good to you, then you’ll be in alignment not only about the subject of money, but about every important subject in your physical experience. 64. Can we succeed without talent? Jerry: Abraham, what bearing does talent or skill or ability have on bringing abundance or money into our lives? Abraham: Very little. Those are all action aspects for the most part, and your action is responsible but for a miniscule part of what comes to you. Your thoughts and words (words are thoughts articulated) are the reason that your life unfolds as it does. Jerry: So then would you say that people with no salable skill or talent could still receive all the financial abundance they want in their lives? Abraham: Absolutely. Unless in comparing themselves to others and concluding that they have no salable skill or talent they feel diminished and therefore defeat their own experience with their own negative expectation. The most valuable skill that you could ever develop is the skill of directing your thoughts toward what you want, to be adept at quickly evaluating all situations and then quickly coming to the conclusion of what you most want, and then giving your undivided attention to that. There is tremendous skill in directing your own thoughts that will yield results that cannot be compared with results that mere action can provide. 65. Can we get something without giving? Jerry: How can a person get passed the belief that they must give a dollar’s worth of something in order to get a dollar’s worth of something? Abraham: Your knowledge in all things comes only through life experience. But your life experience comes as a result of the thoughts that you’re thinking. So, even though you may have wanted something for a very long time, if your thoughts have been upon the absence of it, then it"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78 could not come to you, and so from your personal experience you come to the conclusion that it’s not possible, or that it’s a struggle. In other words, you come to many valid conclusions about things being hard when you’ve lead a difficult life. It’s our desire to help you to understand what is really at the heart of that self-created struggle. We want to help you to begin from a different premise, and understand the Laws at the basis of all things. A new understanding of the Laws of the Universe and a willingness to begin telling a different story will give you different results. And those different results will then give you different beliefs, or knowledge. You are the one, you are the only one who can evaluate your effectiveness. No one else has the ability to discern where you stand relative to where you’re wanting to be. And no one else can decide where you should be. Only you. 66. They want to win the lottery fortune Jerry: Many people are hoping for some major financial windfall to come to them to free them from debt or to release them from working at something they don’t want to work at in order to receive money. The thing I hear them say most often is that they want to win the lottery where they’ll get their abundance at exchange for someone else losing theirs. Abraham: If their expectation were in a place that would allow it, then that could be a way for money to come to them. But most know the odds against that, and so for most their expectation for winning the lottery is not in the powerful place either. Jerry: So, how does hoping to win relate to expecting to win? Abraham: Well, just as hoping is more productive than doubting, expecting is much more productive than hoping. Jerry: Well then how could a person begin to expect something that their life experience hasn’t yet shown them? In other words, how can you expect something you haven’t experienced? Abraham: You do not have to have money to attract money. But you cannot feel poor and attract money. The key is, you have to find ways of improving the way you feel from right where you stand before things can begin to change. By softening your attention to the things that are going"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"79 wrong, and by beginning to tell stories that lean more in the direction of what you want instead of in the direction of what you’ve got, your vibration will shift, your point of attraction will shift, and you’ll get different results. And in a short time, because of the different results you’re then getting, you will then have beliefs, or knowledge, of abundance that will easily perpetuate more of the same. People often say, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And that’s why. Look for reasons to feel good, identify what you want, and hold your thoughts in a place that feels good. 67. Living abundantly is not magic As we explain from our perspective the abundant nature of your Universe, and the potential for abundance that’s always available to you, we understand that our knowledge does not become your knowledge only because you hear us say it. If you asked you to trust what we say or just try to understand, you cannot just adopt our understanding as your own, for it’s only your own life experience that brings knowledge to you. The beliefs that you hold as a result of your own life experience are very strong. And we understand that you cannot release them immediately and replace them with others, even though we know that there are many more productive beliefs that you could foster. But there is something that you can begin today that will make a profound difference in the way your life unfolds, that does not require an immediate releasing of the beliefs that you currently hold – start telling a more positive better-feeling story about your life, and about the things that are important to you. Do not write your story like a factual document, weighing all the pros and cons of your experience. But instead tell the uplifting fanciful magical story of the wonder of your own life. And watch what happens. It will feel like magic as your life begins to transform right before your eyes. But it’s not by magic. It’s by the power of the Laws of the Universe and your deliberate alignment with those Laws. 68. Trading freedom for money? Whether you’re focused upon the lack of money or the lack of time, you’re still focused upon the lack of something you want, and therefore holding yourself in resistance to the things you really want. Whether your negative emotion is because of your feeling of shortage of time, or whether it’s because of your feeling of shortage of money, you’re still feeling negative emotion, and you’re still in the state of resistance, and therefore you’re holding away what you really want."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80 As you feel that you do not have enough time to do all of the things that you need or want to do, your attention to lack negatively impacts you much more than you realize. A feeling of being overwhelmed is your indicator that you’re denying yourself access to ideas, rendezvous, conditions and all manner of cooperation that could assist you if you were not disallowing them. It is an uncomfortable cycle where you feel a shortage of time, you focus upon your overloaded schedule, and then you feel overwhelmed, and in all of that you offer a vibration that makes improvement impossible. You have to begin telling a different story. You cannot continue to comment on how much you have to do without holding assistance away. There’s a cooperative Universe at your fingertips ready and able to help you in more ways than you can begin to imagine. But you deny yourself that benefit as you continue to complain about too much to do. As you feel that you do not have enough money, your attention to the lack of money disallows the avenues that could bring you more. You just cannot look at the opposite of what you want and get what you want. You have to begin telling a different story. You have to find a way to create a feeling of abundance before abundance can come. As you begin to feel free-er regarding the expenditure of time and money, doors will open, people will come to assist you, refreshing and productive ideas will occur to you, and circumstances and events will unfold. As you change the way you feel, you access the Energy that creates worlds. It’s there for your ready access at all times. 69. Feeling negative with respect to dollars or cancer Jerry: Abraham, what’s the difference between having a negative feeling about money, and therefore you don’t get the money, and saying, “I don’t want cancer”, but you do get cancer? Abraham: Here’s the way it works – you get the essence of what you think about. And so, as you’re thinking about the lack of health, you’re getting the lack of health. As you’re thinking about the lack of money, you’re getting the lack of money. You can tell by the way you feel as you’re offering your thought whether you’re attracting the positive or the negative aspects of the subject. The Universe does not hear “No”. When you’re saying, “No, I do not want illness”, your attention to the subject of illness is saying, “Yes, come to me this thing I do not want”. Anything you’re giving your attention to is an invitation to the essence of it. When you’re saying, “I want money, but it will not come”, your attention to its absence is the same thing as saying, “Come to me, absence of money, which I do not want”."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"81 When you’re thinking of money in the way that will make it come to you, you always feel good. When you are thinking of money in the way that keeps it from coming to you, you always feel bad. That’s how you know the difference. So, you’re asking, “If I can get cancer by focusing upon the lack of health, then why couldn’t I get money by focusing upon the lack of it?” The receiving of money which you do want is the same as the receiving of health which you do want. The receiving of cancer which you do not want is the same as the receiving of no money which you do not want. Just make sure that whatever thoughts you’re thinking, or whatever words you’re speaking, evoke from you positive emotion. And then you’ll be in the mode of attracting what you do want. When negative emotion is present, you’re always in the mode of attracting something you do not want. 70. He didn’t struggle for money Not long ago someone at a gathering was challenging LOA in a similar way as she told the story about her friend who had supported her former husband for many years. She explained how her friend had worked hard and taken care of him for all of that time and was often struggling to earn enough money to support them. Eventually she grew tired of his unwillingness to contribute financially, and they separated. Her husband never showed any evidence that money was important to him, but now, she tells us, he’s just inherited over a million dollars and now he won’t share his money with his ex-wife. “It doesn’t seem fair”, this woman said to us, “that his wife cared about money and worked hard for it and received so little, while he barely worked and didn’t seem to care about money at all, and now he’s inherited over a million dollars. How can that be?” she wanted to know. We explained to her that understanding the LOA as we do, this story makes perfect sense. This woman worked hard and felt resentment, and was focused upon lack, and the Universe matched those feelings precisely. Her husband felt ease, refused to feel guilty, expected things to come to him easily, and the Universe matched those feelings precisely. Many believe that they must work hard and struggle and pay a price and feel pain and that they will then be rewarded for their struggle. But that is not consistent with the Laws of the Universe. You cannot find a happy ending to an unhappy journey. That defies Law. We told our friend, there is not a shred of evidence to the contrary of the LOA, and you had the benefit of knowing these two people, of seeing their attitudes and watching their results: one struggling, working hard, doing what society taught her to do, and not getting what she wants; while"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82 the other refused to struggle, insisted on a feeling of ease, and is the recipient of the resources that support more ease. Many would say, “Well, it might be consistent with the Laws of the Universe, but it’s still not right”. But we want you to know that when you get in sync with this powerful Law, you will then understand the absolute justice of it. Since you have control over what you offer, what could be more just than the Universe giving you exactly what you offer vibrationally? What could be more just than the powerful LOA responding equally to everyone who offers a vibration? Once you gain control over the thoughts you think, your sense of injustice will subside, and will be replaced with the exuberance for life and the zest to create that you were born with. Let everything in the Universe be an example to you of the way the Laws of the Universe work. If you believe that you must work hard in order to deserve the money that comes to you, then money cannot come to you unless you do work hard. But the money that comes in response to physical action is very small in comparison with what comes through alignment of thought. Surely you have noticed the enormous disparity between some people who apply tremendous action for little return while you see others seemingly offering very little action for an enormous return. We want you to understand that the disparity exists only in the comparison of the action they’re offering. But there is no disparity or injustice relative to the alignment of Energies within them. Financial success or any other kind of success does not require hard work or action. But it does require alignment of thought. You simply cannot offer negative thought about things that you desire and then make up for it with action or hard work. When you learn to direct your own thoughts, you will discover the true leverage of Energy alignment. Most of you are much closer to a financial fortune than you are even allowing yourself to purely desire. Because in the thought that it might come you right away begin thinking of how disappointed you will be if it does not come. And so, in your lackful thought you do not allow yourself to desire or to expect anything magnificent in terms of money. And that’s the reason why for the most part you’re living rather mediocre financial experiences. You are right when you think money isn't everything. You certainly do not need money to have joy in your experience. But in your society—where so much of what you live is tied to money in some way—most of you associate money with freedom. And since freedom is a basic tenet of your being, then coming into alignment with money will help you establish a balanced footing that will be of value to you in all other aspects of your experience."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"83 71. Is spending money comfortable? A woman said to us one day, “I always feel uncomfortable when I spend money”. She told us that over time she’d managed to save quite a bit of money, but whenever she thought about spending any of it, she would freeze up and feel afraid to go another step further. We said to her, it is certainly understandable that when you believe that your money is coming to you because of the action that you’re offering, and you also believe that you will not always be able to offer the action, that you would want to hold on to your money and spend it sparingly to make it last. However, that feeling of shortage slows the process of more money flowing into your experience. If you feel uncomfortable with the idea of spending money, then we absolutely do not encourage you to spend the money while you’re feeling uncomfortable. Because any action taken during negative emotion is never a good idea. But the reason for your discomfort is not about the action of spending the money, but instead it’s an indication that your thoughts about money in that moment are not a vibrational match to your own desire. A belief in shortage will never resonate with your broader knowing, because there is no shortage. Any attention to lack of something wanted will always produce negative emotion within you because your guidance is letting you know that you have strayed from your broader basic understanding of abundance and of Well-Being. Find a way to ease your discomfort and eventually transform it into a feeling hope, and then into positive expectation. And then from that stable place of feeling better that feeling of freezing up will be replaced with confidence and enthusiasm. Whether you are focused upon the shortage of money—or seeing yourself as having only so many years to live (and so each day that is expended is one day closer to the end of your years)—that feeling of decline is contrary to your broader understanding of the Eternal nature of your Being. In the same way that you understand that you do not have to attempt the impossible task of drawing enough air into your lungs to last all day or all week or all year, but instead you easily breathe in and out, always receiving what you want or need whenever you want or need it, money can flow in and out of your experience with the same ease, once you achieve that expectation of eternal abundance. All of the money that you want is available for you to receive. All you have to do is allow it into your experience. And as the money flows in, you can gently allow it to flow out. For like the air you breathe, there will always be more to flow. You do not have to guard your money, like holding your breathe and not letting it out because there will not be any more coming. More is coming."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84 People sometimes protest as they tell their stories of shortage or scarcity, pointing out the reality of the shortage that they’ve experienced or witnessed or heard about. And we understand that there are plenty of examples to point to, of people who are experiencing shortages of many things that they desire. But we want you to understand that those experiences of shortage are not because abundance is not available. But instead because it is being disallowed. Continuing to tell stories of shortage only continues to contradict your desire for abundance. And you cannot have it both ways. You cannot focus on unwanted and receive wanted. You cannot focus upon stories about money that make you feel uncomfortable and allow into your experience what makes you feel comfortable. You have to begin telling a different story if you want different results. We would begin by saying, “I want to feel good. I want to feel productive and expansive. My thoughts are the basis for the attraction of all things that I consider to be good, which includes enough money for my comfort and joy, which includes health and wonderful people around me who are stimulating and uplifting and exciting”. Begin telling the story of your desire and then add to it the details of the positive aspects that you can find that match those desires. And then embellish your positive expectation by speculating with your good-feeling Wouldn't it be nice if . . . ? examples. Say things like: “Only good things come to me. . . While I don’t have all of the answers, and while I don’t know all of the steps, and I can’t identify all of the doors that will open for me, I know that as I move through time and space, the path will become obvious to me. I know I will be able to figure it out as I go along.” Every time you tell your better-feeling story, you will feel better and the details of your life will improve. The better it gets, the better it gets. 72. How to change my point of attraction? Sometimes people worry that they’ve been telling the story of what they do not want for such a long time that they now do not have time left in their life to make up for all those years of focusing upon the shortage of money. They have no cause for worry. Although it is true that you cannot go backward and undo all of that negative thinking, there is no reason to do that even if you could, because all of your power is in your now. As you find a better-feeling thought right now, your point"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85 of attraction shifts now. The only reason that it may seem like negative thinking that you’ve picked up many years ago is having an impact on your life now is because you have been continuing the negative train of thought or beliefs through all of those years. A belief is only a thought you continue to think. A belief is nothing more than a chronic pattern of thought, and you have the ability, if you try a little bit, to begin a new pattern, to tell a new story, to achieve a different vibration, to change your point of attraction. Just a simple act of noticing how many things you could purchase in this one day with a 100 dollars you’re carrying with you would dramatically alter your financial point of attraction. That one simple process is enough to tip the balance of your vibrational scale, enough to show you actual tangible results in your attraction of money. Mentally spend your money and imagine an improved lifestyle. Deliberately conjure a feeling of freedom by imagining what it would feel like to have a large amount of money at your disposal. You see, the LOA is responding to your vibration, not to the reality you’re currently living. But if your vibration continues to be only about the reality you are living, nothing can change. You can easily change your point of attraction by visualizing the lifestyle you desire and holding your attention upon those images until you begin to feel relief, which is an indicator that a true vibrational shift has occurred. 73. My standards are mine to set Sometimes from an awareness of shortage of money you think that you want everything that you see. A sort of uncontrollable craving rises within you, which tortures you when you do not have the money to spend, or causes even more distress when you give into the cravings and spend money you do not have, going deeper into debt. But that craving to spend money under those conditions is really a false signal. For it’s not coming from a real desire to have those things. Buying one more thing and bringing it home will not satisfy that craving. For what you’re really feeling is a void that can only be filled by coming into vibrational alignment with who-you-really-are. You’re currently feeling insecure, when who-you-really-are is someone who is absolutely secure. You’re currently feeling inadequate, when who-you-really-are is someone who is adequate. You’re feeling lack, when who-you-really-are is someone who is abundant. It is a vibrational shift that you’re craving, not the ability to purchase something. Once you’re able to achieve and consistently maintain your personal alignment, a great deal of money will flow into your experience, if that is your desire. And you will very likely spend large amounts of money on things that you desire. But your purchases will feel very different to you then. You will not feel a need or a void that you’re attempting to fill with that purchase, but instead you"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86 will feel a satisfying interest in something, which will easily make its way into your experience. And every part of the process – from the inception of the idea to the full blown manifestation of it in your experience – will bring you a feeling of satisfaction and joy. Do not let others set the standards about how much money you should have or about what you should do with it, for you are the only one who could ever accurately define that. Come into alignment with who-you-really-are and allow the things that life has helped you to know that you want to flow into your experience. 74. Does saving for security work? A man related to us that he once had a teacher who told him that to set money aside for security was the same as planning for a disaster. And that, I fact, the very act of trying to feel more secure would actually lead to more insecurity, because it would attract the unwanted disaster. He wanted to know if that philosophy fit in with our teachings about the LOA. We told him that teacher was right in pointing out that attention to anything brings more of the essence of it to you. And so, if you were to focus upon the idea of possible bad things looming out there in your future, the discomfort that you would feel as you pondered those unwanted things would be your indication that you are indeed in the process of attracting them. But it is absolutely possible to briefly consider something unwanted occurring in the future, such as a financial situation that makes you feel insecure as you consider it, which could cause you to then consider the financial stability that you desire. As you focus upon the security that you desire, you may very well be inspired to an action that enhances that state of security. The action of saving money or investing in assets in and of itself is neither positive nor negative. But that teacher would be correct to say that you cannot get to a place of security from an insecure footing. Our encouragement is to use the power of your mind to focus upon the good-feeling security you seek, and then take whatever positive action that’s inspired from that place of feeling good. Anything that feels good to you is in harmony with what you want. Anything that feels bad to you, is not in harmony with what you want. It is truly as simple as that. Some say that you should not want money at all, because the desire for money is materialistic and not spiritual. But we want you to remember that you are here in this very physical world, where spirit has materialized. You’re here in your very physical bodies on this very physical planet, where that which is spirit and that which is physical, or material, blend. You cannot separate yourself from the aspect of yourself that is spiritual. And while you are here in these bodies, you cannot separate"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"87 yourself from that which is physical, or material. All of the magnificent things of a physical nature, that are surrounding you, are spiritual in nature. 75. Telling a new story about abundance, money and financial Well-Being The LOA is not responding to the reality that you’re currently living and perpetuating. But instead it is responding to the vibrational patterns of thoughts that are emanating from you. So, as you begin to tell the story of who-you-are in relationship to money from your perspective of what you desire, rather than from the perspective of what you’re actually currently living, your patterns of thought will shift, and so will your point of attraction. What-is has no bearing on what is coming, unless you’re continually regurgitating the story of what-is. By thinking and speaking more of how you really want your life to be, you allow what you’re currently living to be the jumping off place for so much more. But if you speak predominantly of what-is, then you still jump off, but you jump off into more of the same. So, consider the following questions, letting your natural answers flow in response to them. And then hear some examples of what your new story regarding money might sound like. And then begin to tell your own new and improved story of your financial picture and watch how quickly and surely circumstances and events will begin to move around you to make your new story a reality. Do you have as much money in your life experience as you want right now? Is the Universe abundant? Do you have the option of having plenty of money? Was the amount of money that you would receive in this lifetime already decided before you were born? Are you now setting into motion through the power of your current thought the amount of money that will flow? Do you have the ability to change your financial situation? Are you in control of your financial condition? Do you want more money? Knowing what you now know, is financial abundance guaranteed? 76. An example of my “old” story about money Here’s an example of an “old” story about money:"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"88 “There are so many things that I want that I just can’t afford. I’m making more money today than ever before, but money feels as tight as ever, it just seems like I can’t get ahead. It seems like I’ve worried about money my whole life. I remember how hard my parents worked, and my mother’s constant worry about money, and I guess I inherited all of that. But that isn’t the kind of inheritance I’d hope for. I know there are really wealthy people in the world who don’t have to worry about money, but they aren’t anywhere near me. Everyone I know right now is struggling and worried about what’s going to happen next”. Notice how this story began by noticing a current unwanted condition, and then moved to justification of the situation, and then looked into the past for more emphasis of the current problem, which amplified the resentment more, then moved on to a broader view of perceived shortage. In other words, when you begin to tell a negative story, the LOA will help you reach from your present perspective into your past, even into your future, but the same vibrational pattern of lack will persist. When you focus upon lack in an attitude of complaining, you establish a vibrational point of attraction that then gives you access only to more thoughts of complaint, whether you’re focused in your present, your past or your future. Your deliberate effort to tell a new story will change that. Your new story will establish a new pattern of thought, providing you with a new point of attraction from your present, about your past and into your future. The simple effort of looking for positive aspects from right where you stand will set a new vibrational tone that will not only effect the way you feel right now, but will begin the immediate attraction of thoughts, people, circumstances and things that are pleasing to you. 77. An example of my “new” story about money Here’s an example of a “new” story about money: “I like the idea that money is as available as the air I breathe. I like the idea of breathing in and breathing out more money. It’s fun to imagine a lot of money flowing to me. I can see how my feeling about money affects the money that comes to me. I am happy to understand that with practice I can control my attitude about money or about anything. I notice that the more I tell my story of abundance, the better I feel. I like knowing that I am the creator of my own reality, and that the money that flows into my experience is directly related to my thoughts. I like knowing that I can adjust the amount of money that I receive by adjusting my thoughts. Now that I understand the formula for creating, now that I understand that I do get the essence of what I think about, and most"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"89 important, now that I understand that I can tell by the way I’m feeling whether I’m focused upon money or lack of money, I feel confident that in time I will align my thoughts with abundance and money will flow powerfully into my experience. I understand that the people around me hold many different perspectives about money, about wealth, about spending, saving, philanthropy, giving money, receiving money, earning money and so forth, and it’s not necessary for me to understand their opinions or experiences. I’m relieved to know that I do not have to sort all of that out. It is very nice to know that my only work is to align my own thoughts about money with my own desires about money, and that whenever I’m feeling good, I’ve found that alignment. I like knowing that it’s alright for me to occasionally feel negative emotion regarding money. But it is my intention to quickly direct my thoughts in better-feeling directions, because it’s logical to me that thoughts that feel good when I think them will bring positive results. I understand that money will not necessarily manifest instantly in my experience with the changing of my thinking, but I do expect to see steady improvement as a result of my deliberate effort to think better-feeling thoughts. The first evidence of my alignment with money will be my improved feeling, my improved mood, my improved attitude. And then real changes in my financial situation will be soon to follow. I’m certain about that. I am aware of the absolute correlation between what I’ve been thinking and feeling about money, and what is actually happening in my life experience. I can see the evidence of the LOA’s absolute and unerring response to my thought, and I look forward to more evidence in response to my improved thoughts. I can feel a powerful leveraging of Energy in being more deliberate about my thoughts. I believe that at many levels I’ve always known this, and it feels good to return to my core beliefs about my power and value and worthiness. I am living a very abundant life, and it feels so good to realize that whatever this life experience causes me to desire, I can achieve that. I love knowing that I am unlimited. I feel tremendous relief in recognizing that I do not have to wait for money or things to materialize before I can feel better. And I now understand that when I do feel better, the things and experiences and money that I want must come. As easily as air flows in and out of my being, so it is with money. My desire draws it in, and my ease of thought lets it flow out. In and out.. in and out.. ever flowing.. always easy.. whatever I desire.. whenever I desire.. as much as I desire.. in and out..” There is no right or wrong way to tell your improved story. It can be about your past, present or future experiences. The only criterion that’s important is that you be conscious of your intent to tell a better-feeling improved version of your story. Telling many good-feeling short stories through your day will change your point of attraction. Just remember that the story you tell is the basis of your life. So tell it the way you want it to be."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90 Part III. Maintaining my physical Well-Being 79. My thoughts create my physical experience The idea of success for most people revolves around money or the acquisition of property or other possessions. But we consider a state of joy as the greatest achievement of success. And while the attainment of money and wonderful possessions certainly can enhance your state of joy, the achievement of a good-feeling physical body is by far the greatest factor for maintaining a continuing state of joy and Well-Being. Every part of your life is experienced through the perspective of your physical body, and when you feel good, everything you see looks better. Certainly, it is possible to maintain a good attitude even when your physical body is diminished in some way, but a good feeling body is a powerful basis for an ongoing good attitude. And so, it’s not surprising that since the way you feel affects your thoughts and attitudes about things, and since your thoughts and attitudes equal your point of attraction, and since your point of attraction equals the way your life continues to play out, there are few things of greater value than the achievement of a good feeling body. It is quite interesting to note that not only does a good feeling body promote positive thoughts, but that also positive thoughts promote a good feeling body. That means, you do not have to be in a perfect state of health in order to find feelings of relief that can eventually lead to a wonderful mood or attitude. For if you’re able to somehow find that relief, even when your body is hurting or sick, you will find physical improvement, because your thoughts create your reality. 80. Complaining about complaining is also complaining Many complain that it’s easy to be optimistic when you’re young and in good health, but that it’s very difficult when you’re older or sicker. But we never encourage using your age or a current state of failing health as a limiting thought that disallows improvement or recovery. Most people have no idea of the power of their own thoughts. They do not realize that as they continue to find things to complain about, they disallow their own physical Well-Being. Many do not realize that before they were complaining about an aching body or a chronic disease, they were complaining about other things first. It does not matter if the object of your complaint is about someone you’re angry with, someone who’s betrayed you, behavior in others that you believe is wrong, or something wrong with your own physical body - complaining is complaining, and it disallows recovery. So, whether you’re feeling good and are looking for a way to maintain that good feeling state of being, or if your physical body is diminished in some way and you’re looking for recovery, the process is the same –"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"91 learn to guide your thoughts in the direction of things that feel good, and discover the power that only comes from vibrational alignment with Source. As you continue to read here, things that you’ve known long before you were born will be remembered, and you’ll begin to feel a resonance with these Laws and processes that will give you a feeling of empowerment. And then all that is required for the achievement and maintenance of a healthy good feeling body is some deliberate attention to thoughts and feelings, and a sincere desire to feel good. 81. I can feel good in my body If you’re not feeling good or looking the way you want to look, it has a way of reflecting out into other aspects of your life experience, and it’s for that reason that we want to emphasize the value in bringing your physical body into balance and comfort and Well-Being. There is nothing in the Universe that responds faster to your thoughts than your own physical body. And so, aligned thoughts bring a quick response and obvious results. Your physical Well-Being is really the easiest of subjects over which you have absolute control, for it is what you are doing about you. However, because you’re translating everything in this world through the lens of how your physical body feels, if you do get out of balance, it can negatively affect a much larger part of your life than only your physical body. You’re never more clear about wanting to be healthy and to feel good than when you are sick and feeling bad. And so, the experience of being sick is a powerful launching pad for the asking for wellness. So, if in the moment that your sickness has caused you to ask for wellness you could turn your undivided attention to the idea of being well, it would occur immediately. But for most, now that you’re feeling bad, that’s what has your attention. Once you’re sick, it is logical that you would now notice how you feel, and in doing so you would prolong the sickness. But it was not your attention to the lack of Wellness that made you sick, instead it was your attention to the lack of many things that you desire. Chronic attention to unwanted things holds you in a place of disallowing your physical Well-Being as well as disallowing the solutions to other subjects you’re focused upon. If you could focus your attention upon the idea of experiencing physical Well-Being with as much passion as you focus upon the absence of it, not only would you recover quickly, but maintaining your physical Well-Being in balance would also be easy."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92 82. Words do not teach, but life experience does Simply hearing words, even when they are perfect words that accurately explain truths, does not bring understanding. But the combination of careful words of explanation coupled with life experience, that is always consistent with the Laws of the Universe, does bring understanding. It is our expectation that as you hear these words, and then live your life, you will achieve a complete understanding of how all things occur in your experience, and you will accomplish complete control of all aspects of your life, especially things that have to do with your own body. Perhaps your physical condition is exactly as you want it to be. If that is the case, then continue to focus upon your body as it is, feeling appreciation for the aspects that are pleasing you, and you’ll maintain that condition. But if there are changes that you would like to make, whether it is in appearance or stamina or Wellness, then it will be of great value for you to begin telling a different story. Not only about your body, but about all subjects that have been troubling you. As you begin to positively focus, getting to feel so good about so many subjects, that you often feel passion rise up within you, you will begin to feel the power of the Universe. The power that creates worlds flowing through you. You are the only one who creates in your experience. No one else. Everything that comes to you comes by the power of your thought. When you focus long enough that you feel passion, you harness more power and you achieve greater results. The other thoughts, while they are important and have creative potential, usually are only maintaining what you’ve already created. And so, many people continue to maintain unwanted physical experiences simply by offering consistent – not powerful and not accompanied by strong emotion – thoughts. In other words, they merely continue telling the same stories about things that seem unfair or unwanted things that they disagree with. And in doing so they maintain unwanted conditions. The simple intention of telling better feeling stories about all subjects that you focus upon will have a great effect on your physical body. But since words do not teach, it is our suggestion that you try telling a different story for a while, and observe for yourself what happens. 83. The Law of Attraction expands my every thought The LOA says, “That which is like unto itself, is drawn”. In other words, that which you think in any moment attracts unto itself other thoughts that are like it. That is why whenever you’re thinking about a subject that is not pleasant, more unpleasant thoughts regarding that subject are quickly"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"93 drawn. You find yourself, in very short order, not only experiencing what you’re experiencing in this moment, but reaching into your past for more data that matches that vibration. And now, by the LOA, as your negative thought expands proportionately, so does your negative emotion. Soon you find yourself discussing the unpleasant subject with others. And now they add to it, often reaching into their past, until in a very short period of time most of you, upon any subject that you ponder very long, attract enough supporting data that it does bring forth the essence of the subject of the thought into your experience. It is natural that by knowing what you do not want you are able to clarify what you do want. And there is nothing wrong with identifying a problem before beginning to look for a solution. But many people over time become problem oriented rather than solution oriented, and in their examination and explanation of the problem they continue the perpetuation of the problem. Again, telling a different story is of great value. Tell a solution oriented story instead of a problem oriented story. If you wait until you’re sick before you begin to try to focus more positively, it’s much harder than if you begin to tell the story of Well-Being from your place of feeling good. But in any case, your new story will in time bring you different results. That which is like unto itself is drawn. So, tell the story you want to live and you will eventually live it. Some people worry that since they’re already sick, they cannot now be well, because their sickness now has their attention, and therefore their attention to sickness is perpetuating more sickness. We agree, that would be correct, if they only have the ability to focus upon what-is at this time. But since it is possible to think about things other than what is happening right now, it is possible for things to change. However, you cannot focus only upon current problems and get change. You have to focus upon the positive results that you are seeking in order to get something different. The LOA is responding to your thought, not to your current reality. When you change the thought, your reality must follow suit. If things are going very well for you right now, then focusing upon what is happening now will cause the Well-Being to continue. But if there are things that are happening now that are not pleasing, you must find a way of taking your attention away from those unwanted things. You have the ability to focus your thoughts about yourself, about your body, and about the things that matter to you in a different direction from only what is happening right now. You have the ability to imagine things that are coming, or to remember things that have happened before. And when you do so with the deliberate intent of finding good feeling things to think and speak about, you can quickly change your patterns of thought, and therefore your vibration, and eventually your life experience."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"94 84. 15 minutes to my intentional Well-Being It is not easy to imagine a healthy foot when your toe is painfully throbbing, but it is of great value for you to do everything you can do to distract yourself from your throbbing toe. However, a time of acute physical discomfort is not an effective time to try to visualize Well-Being. The best time to do that is when you’re feeling the best you usually feel. In other words, if you usually feel physically better during the first part of the day, choose that time for visualization of your new story. If you usually feel better after taking a long warm bath, choose that time for visualization. Set aside approximately 15 minutes where you can close your eyes and withdraw as much as possible from your awareness of what-is. Try to find a quite place, where you will not be distracted, and imagine yourself in a state of physical thriving. Imagine walking briskly and breathing deeply, and enjoying the flavor of the air you are breathing. Imagine walking briskly upon gentle incline and smile in appreciation of the stamina of your body. See yourself bending and stretching, and enjoying the flexibility of your body. Take your time exploring pleasant scenarios with the sole intent of enjoying your body, and appreciating its strength and stamina, and flexibility and beauty. When you visualize for the joy of visualizing rather than with the intention of correcting some deficiency, your thoughts are more pure and therefore more powerful. When you visualize to overcome something that is wrong, your thoughts are diluted with the lackful side of the equation. Sometimes people explain that they have long held desires that have not manifested, and they argue that the LOA is not working for them. But that is because they’ve been asking for improvement from a place of keen awareness of the lack of what they desire. It takes time to reorient your thoughts so that they’re predominantly focused toward what you want. But in time it will feel perfectly natural to you to do so. In time your new story will be the one that you tell most easily. If you do take the time to positively imagine your body, those good feeling thoughts will become dominant. And then your physical condition must acquiesce to those thoughts. But if you only focus upon the conditions as they exist, nothing will change. As you imagine and visualize and verbalize your new story, in time you will believe the new story. And when that happens, the evidence will flow swiftly into your experience. A belief is only a thought you continue to think, and when your beliefs match your desires, then your desires must become your reality."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"95 Nothing stands between you and anything that you desire other than your own patterns of thought. There is no physical body, no matter what the state of decline, no matter what the conditions, that cannot achieve an improved condition. Nothing else in your experience responds as quickly as your own physical body to your patterns of thought. 85. I am not bound by others’ beliefs With a little bit of effort focused in the right direction you will achieve remarkable results. And in time you will remember that you can be or do or have anything that you focus upon and achieve vibrational alignment with. You came into your physical body and into this physical world from your Nonphysical perspective, and you were very clear about your intention to be here. You did not define all of the details of your physical life experience before you got here, but you did set forth clear intentions about the vitality of your physical body from which you would create your life experience. You felt enormous eagerness to be here. When you first arrived in your small infant body, you were closer to the Inner world than to the physical world, and your sense of Well-Being and strength was very strong. But as time passed and you became focused into your physical world, you began to observe others who’d lost their strong connection to Well-Being. And bit by bit your sense of Well-Being began to fade as well. It is possible to be born into this physical world and continue to maintain your connection to who- you-really-are and to your absolute Well-Being. However, most people, once they’re focused into this time/space reality, do not. The primary reason for the fading of your awareness of personal Well-Being is the clamoring of those around you for you to find ways to please them. While your parents and teachers are, for the most part, well-meaning people, they are, nevertheless, more interested in your finding ways to please them than in your finding ways to please yourself. And so, in the process of socialization almost all people in almost all societies lose their way, because they’re coaxed or coerced away from their own guidance system. Most societies demand that you make your action your top priority. You are rarely encouraged to consider your vibrational alignment, or your connection to your Inner World. Most people eventually become motivated by the approval or disapproval that is directed at them by others. And so, with their misplaced attention upon accomplishing the action that is most respected by the onlookers of their lives, they lose their alignment, and then everything in their experience is diminished. But you were eager about being born into this physical world of such amazing variety, because you understood the value of that contrast from which you would build your own experience. You knew that you would come to"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"96 understand form your own experience what you preferred from the variety of options that would be available to you. Whenever you know what you do not want, you understand more clearly what it is that you do want. But so many people take that first step of identifying what is not wanted, and instead of then turning toward what is wanted and achieving vibrational alignment with that, they instead continue to talk about what they do not want. And in time, the vitality that they were born with, wanes. 86. There is time enough to accomplish it When you do not understand the power of thought, and you do not take the time to align your thought to allow this power, you are then resigned to create through the power of action, which comparatively is not much. And so, if you’ve been working hard with your action to accomplish something, and have not managed to achieve it, often you feel overwhelmed or incapable of now making it happen. Some people simply feel that they do not have enough time left in their lives to be and do and have the things that they have dreamed of. But we want you to understand that if you will take the time to deliberately align with the Energy that creates worlds through the power of focusing your thoughts, you will discover a leverage that will help you quickly accomplish things that have formally seemed not possible. There is nothing that you cannot be or do or have, once you accomplish the necessary alignment. And when you do, your own life experience will give you the evidence of your alignment. Before things actually manifest, your proof of alignment comes in the form of positive good feeling emotion. And if you understand that, then you will be able to hold steady to your course, while the manifestation of the things you desire are making their way to you. The LOA says, “That which is like unto itself, is drawn”. Whatever your state of being, whatever the way you feel, you’re attracting more of the essence of that. To want or desire something always feels good, when you believe you can achieve it. But desire in the face of doubt feels very uncomfortable. We want you to understand that wanting something and believing you can accomplish it, is a state of alignment. While wanting something and doubting it, is misalignment. Wanting and believing is alignment. Wanting and expecting is alignment. Expecting something unwanted is not alignment. You can feel your alignment or misalignment."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"97 87. Why do I want perfect bodily conditions? Although it may seem strange to you, we cannot begin to address your physical body without addressing your nonphysical roots and your eternal connection to those roots, because you, in your physical body, are an extension of that Inner-Being. In very simple terms, in order to be at your maximum state of health and Well-Being, you must be in vibrational alignment with your Inner- Being. And in order to do that, you must be aware of your emotions, or feelings. You physical state of Well-Being is directly related to your vibrational alignment with your Inner- Being, or Source. Which means, every thought that you think on every subject can positively or negatively affect that connection. In other words, it is not possible to maintain a healthy physical body without a keen awareness of your emotions and a determination to direct your thoughts toward good feeling subjects. When you remember that feeling good is natural and you make an effort to find the positive aspects of the subjects that you’re considering, you will train the thoughts to match the thoughts of your Inner-Being. And that is of tremendous advantage to your physical body. When your thoughts are chronically good feeling, your physical body will thrive. Of course, there is a broad range of emotions from those that feel very bad to those that feel very good. But in any moment in time, because of whatever you’re focused upon, you actually only have two choices in emotion – a better feeling one or a worse feeling one. So, you could accurately say, there are really only two emotions, and you effectively utilize your guidance system when you deliberately choose the better feeling of those two options. And in doing so, in time, you can tune yourself to the precise frequency of your Inner-Being. And when you do that, your physical body will thrive. 88. I can trust my eternal Inner-Being Your Inner-Being is the Source part of you that continues to evolve through the thousands of life experiences that you live. And with each sifting and sorting experience the Source within you always chooses the best feeling of the available choices, which means, your Inner-Being is eternally tuning itself to love and joy and all that is good. That is the reason that when you choose to love another or yourself, rather than find fault, you feel good. Good feeling is confirmation of your alignment with your Source. When you choose thoughts that are out of alignment with Source, which produces an emotional response like fear or anger or jealousy, those feelings indicate your vibrational variance from Source. Source never turns away from you, but offers steadily a steady"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98 vibration of Well-Being. And so, when you feel negative emotion, it means that you are preventing your vibrational access to Source and to the Stream of Well-Being. As you begin telling stories about your body, and about your life and your work and the people in your life, that feel good as you tell them, you will achieve a steady connection with that Stream of Well-Being that is ever flowing to you. And as you focus upon the things that you desire, feeling positive emotion as you focus, you access the power that creates worlds, and you flow it toward your object of attention. 89. What is the role of thought in traumatic injuries? Whether the trauma to your body seemed to come suddenly as a result of an accident, or whether it came from a disease such as cancer, you’ve created the situation through your thought. And the healing will come through your thought as well. Chronic thoughts of ease promote Wellness, while chronic stressful, or resentful, or hateful, or fearful thoughts promote disease. But whether the result shows up suddenly, as in falling and breaking your bones, or more slowly, as in cancer, whatever you’re living always matches the balance of your thoughts. Once you’ve experienced the diminishment of Well-Being, whether it has come as broken bones or internal diseases, it is not likely that you will suddenly find good feeling thoughts that match those of your Inner-Being. In other words, if before your accident, or disease, you were not choosing thoughts that aligned with Well-Being, it’s not likely that now you’re faced with discomfort or pain or a frightening diagnosis you will suddenly find that alignment. It is much easier to achieve great health from moderate health, than to achieve great health from poor health. However, you can get to wherever you want to be from wherever you are, if you’re able to distract your attention from the unwanted aspects of your life, and focus upon aspects that are more pleasing. It really is only a matter of focus. Sometimes a frightening diagnosis or traumatic injury is a powerful catalyst in getting you to focus your attention more deliberately on things that do feel good. In fact, some of our best students of deliberate creation are those who have been given a frightening diagnosis, where doctors have told them that there was nothing more that could be done for them. Who now, since they have no other options, deliberately begin to focus their thoughts. It is interesting that so many people will not do what really works until all other options have been exhausted. But we do understand that you’ve acclimated to your action oriented world, and so action does seem to most of you to be the best first option. We’re not guiding you away from action, but instead encouraging that you find better feeling thoughts first, and then follow with the action that you feel inspired to."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"99 90. Could a congenital illness be vibrationally resolved? From wherever you stand you can get to wherever you want to be. If you could understand that your now is only the jumping off place for that which is to come, you could move quickly, even from dramatic unwanted things, to things that please you. If this life experience contains a data that causes you to give birth to a desire, then the wherewithal to accomplish it is available to you. But you must focus upon where you want to be, not where you are, or you cannot move toward your desire. However, you cannot create outside your own beliefs. 91. Major diseases come and go. But why? Jerry: As cures are being discovered, why don’t we just finally run out of diseases to be cured? Abraham: Because of your attention to lack. Feelings of powerlessness and vulnerability all produce more to feel powerless and vulnerable about. You cannot focus upon the conquering of a disease without giving your attention to disease. But it’s also very important to understand that looking for cures for diseases, even when you find them, is a short-sided, and in a long run ineffective process, because new diseases are continually being created. When you begin to look for and understand the vibrational causes for diseases, rather than looking for cures, then you will come to the end of the pile of diseases. When you are able to deliberately accomplish the emotion of ease, and its accompanying vibrational alignment, it is possible to live disease-free. Most people spend very little time basking in appreciation for the Wellness they are currently experiencing, but instead they wait until they are sick and then they turn their attention to recovery. Good feeling thoughts produce and sustain physical Well-Being. You live in very busy times and you find many things to fuss and worry about. And in doing so, you hold yourself out of alignment. And disease is the result. And then you focus upon the disease and perpetuate more disease. But you can break the cycle at any time. You do not have to wait for your society to understand in order to achieve wonderful physical Wellness yourself. Your natural state is one of Wellness. 92. I’ve witnessed my body heal itself naturally Your body is made up of intelligent cells that are always bringing themselves into balance. And the better you feel, the less you are vibrationally interfering with that cellular rebalancing. If you’re"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"100 focused upon things that are bothering you, the cells of your body are hindered in their natural balancing process, and once an illness has been diagnosed, and you then turn your attention to that illness, the hindering is greater still. Since the cells of your body know what to do to come into balance, if you can find a way of focusing your attention upon good feeling thoughts, you’ll stop your negative interference, and your recovery will come. Every disease (hear it: dis-ease) is caused by vibrational discord, or resistance, without exception. And since most people were unaware of their discordant thoughts prior to the illness, usually making little effort to practice good feeling thoughts, once the illness occurs, it’s very difficult then to find pure positive thoughts. But if you could understand that your thoughts – and your thoughts alone – are causing the resistance that is preventing the Wellness, and you could turn your thoughts in a more positive direction, your recovery could be very fast. No matter what the disease is, and no matter how much it is progressed, the question is: can you direct your thoughts positively regardless of the condition? Usually at this point someone asks, “But what about the sick child, who’s just been born?” Do not assume, because a child is not yet speaking, that the child is not thinking, or offering vibration. There are tremendous influences to Wellness and sickness that occur even when the child is still in the womb, or newly born. 93. By attention to Wellness I’ll maintain Wellness Just as your wound or sickness is evidence of misalignment, your healing or Wellness is evidence of alignment. Your tendency toward Wellness is much stronger than your tendency for illness. And that is the reason that even with some negative thinking most of you do remain mostly well. You’ve come to expect your wounds to heal, which helps tremendously in the healing process, but when the evidence of your illness is something that you cannot see, where you must rely on the investigation of your doctor, who uses his medical tests or equipments to probe for information, you often feel powerless and fearful, which not only slows the healing process, but is also a strong reason for the creation of the illness. Many people have come to feel vulnerable about the unseen parts of their body, and that feeling of vulnerability is a very strong catalyst in the perpetuation of illness. Most people go to the doctor when they are sick, asking for information about what’s wrong. And when you look for something wrong, you usually find it. The LOA insists on it, actually. A continual searching for things wrong with your body will in time produce evidence of something wrong. Not because it was lurking there all along and you finally probed long enough to find it, but because repeated thought eventually creates its equivalent."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"101 94. When inspired to visit a medical doctor There are many who would protest our perspective claming that we are irresponsible when we do not encourage regular check-ups on the quest for things that have gone wrong or could potentially go wrong with your physical body. And if we did not understand the power of your thoughts, we might even say that if it makes you feel more secure to go to the doctor, then by all means go. In fact, sometimes when you go looking for trouble and do not find it, you do feel better. But more often than not, the repeated looking for something wrong over time creates it. It really is that simple. We’re not saying that medicine is bad, or that there is no value to be received by a visit to your doctor. Medicine, doctors, all healing professions in general are neither good nor bad at their own face value. But instead they are as valuable as your vibrational stance can allow them to be. Our encouragement is that you pay attention to your emotional balance, work deliberately to find the best feeling thoughts you can find, and practice them until they are habitual. And in doing so, you will tend to your vibrational alignment first, and then follow through with whatever action you feel inspired to. In other words, a trip to your doctor or action toward anything, when accompanied by joy, or love, or good feeling emotion, is always valuable. While action that is motivated by your fear, or vulnerability, or any bad feeling emotion, is never valuable. Your physical Well-Being, like everything else, is profoundly affected by the beliefs that you hold. Usually when you’re younger, your expectation of Wellness is stronger. But as you get older, most of you degenerate on a sort of sliding scale that reflects what you’re seeing in others around you. And your observation is not inaccurate. Older people often do experience more illness and less vitality. But the reason for the decline of people as they get older is not because their physical bodies are programmed to break down over time, but because the longer they live the more they find to fuss and worry about, causing resistance to their natural stream of Well-Being. Illness is about resistance, not about age. 95. Euphoria in the jaws of a lion Jerry: I heard that a famous man, a doctor Livingstone, while in Africa, was dragged off by a lion that had grabbed him in his jaws. He said that he went into a sort of euphoric state and felt no pain. I’ve seen prey go limp like that when they’re about to be eaten by a larger animal. It’s kind of like there is a giving up and the struggle is over. But my question is about his statement about feeling no pain. Was what he was calling “euphoria” a mental condition or a physical condition? And is that"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"102 something that only happens in extreme conditions, like when you’re about to be eaten or killed, or could it be utilized by anyone when there is something that’s painful in order to not feel the pain? Abraham: You cannot accurately separate that which is physical from that which is mental from that which is coming from your Higher or Inner-Being. In other words, you are a physically focused being, yes. And you’re a thinking mental being, yes. But the Life Force, or Energy, that comes forth from within you, is offered from a broader perspective. In a situation where it’s likely that you would not recover, in other words, once a lion has you in its jaws, usually he’s going to be the victor, your Inner-Being intervenes and offers a flow of Energy that would be received by you as that sort of euphoric state. You do not have to wait until you’re in such an intense situation before you have access to the stream of Well-Being from Source, but most people do not allow it until they have no other choice. You were right in your choice of words that there was giving up that allowed that stream of Well- Being to flow powerfully. But we want you to understand that what was actually given up was a struggle, the resistance, not the desire to continue to live in this physical body. You have to take all of that into consideration as you’re examining specific situations. Someone with less enthusiasm for life with less determination to live and to accomplish, may very well have experienced a different outcome, and have been killed and devoured by the lion. Everything that you experience is about the balance of thought between your desires and your expectations. A state of allowing is something that must be practiced in normal day-to-day circumstances, not in the midst of attacks by lions. But even in the middle of such an intense situation the power of your intentions always causes the outcome. Practiced alignment, brought about by consistently good feeling thoughts, is the path to being pain- free. Pain is only a more emphatic indicator of resistance. First there’s negative emotion, then more negative emotion, then more negative emotion (you have tremendous leeway here), then sensation, then pain. We tell our physical friends, if you have negative emotion and you don’t realize that it’s an indicator, letting you know about resistant thought, and you don’t do something to correct your resistant thought, by the LOA your resistant thought will grow stronger. If you still don’t do anything to bring yourself into alignment and better feeling thought, it will grow stronger still. Until eventually you will experience pain or illness or other indicators of your resistance."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"103 96. How could someone feeling pain focus elsewhere? Jerry: I’ve heard you say that in order to heal ourselves we want to get our thoughts off of the problem and onto what we are wanting. But if we’re in pain, how do we not feel it? How can we get our attention off the pain long enough to concentrate on something we do want? Abraham: You’re right, it is very difficult not to think about the throbbing toe. Most of you do not think clearly about what you do want until you’re living what you don’t want. Most of you sort of drift into your day blundering here and there, not offering any real conscious thought. Because you do not understand the power of your thought, you usually do not offer any real deliberate thought until you’re faced with something that you do not want. And then, once you’re faced with something that you do not want, then you attack it fully, then you give it your attention, which, knowing the LOA as we do, only makes things worse. And so, our encouragement would be, look for times, or segments, when you’re not feeling such intensity of throbbing pain, and then focus upon the Well-Being. You have to find a way of separating what is happening in your experience from your emotional response to what is happening. In other words, you could have pain in your body, and during the pain you could be feeling fear, or you could have pain in your body while feeling hopeful. The pain does not have to dictate your attitude or the thoughts that you’re thinking. It is possible to think about something other than the pain. And if you can achieve that, then in time the pain will subside. However, if once the pain occurs, you give the pain your undivided attention, then you will only perpetuate more of what you do not want. Someone who’s been focused negatively upon any variety of subjects, and now is experiencing pain, now has to overcome the pain and focus positively. You see, your negative habit of thought brought about the illness, and to suddenly switch to positive thoughts, required to allow Wellness, is not likely to be a fast process, because now you have the hindering pain, or illness, or both, to content with. Preventative Wellness is far easier to accomplish than corrective Wellness. But in either case, improved feeling thoughts, thoughts of greater and greater relief are the key. Even in situations where a lot of pain is being experienced, there are times of greater and lesser discomfort. Choose the best feeling times from the range you’re experiencing, to find positive aspects and to choose better feeling thoughts. And as you continue to reach for thoughts that bring greater emotional relief, that positive leaning will eventually bring you back to Wellbeing. Every time. No exceptions."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"104 97. My natural state is one of Well-Being At the core of that which you are is Wellness and Well-Being. And if you’re experiencing anything less than that, there is resistance present within your vibration. Resistance is caused by focusing upon the lack of what is wanted. While allowing is caused by focusing upon what is wanted. Resistance is caused by thought that does not match the perspective of your Source. Allowing is experienced when your current thoughts do match the perspective of your Source. Your natural state is one of Wellness, one of absolute health, one of perfect bodily conditions. And if you’re experiencing anything other than that, it is only because the balance of thought within you is toward the lack of what you want instead of what you do want. It is your resistance that causes an illness in the first place. And it’s your resistance to that illness that holds it to you once it gets there. It’s your attention to what you do not want that creates unwanted things in your experience. And so, it’s logical that your attention to what you do want would be more appropriate. Sometimes you think you’re thinking about Well-Being, when you’re really worried about being sick. And the only way to be sure of the vibrational difference is by paying attention to the emotion that always accompanies your thought. Feeling your way to the thoughts that promote Wellness is much easier than trying to think yourself there. Make a commitment to yourself to feel good, and then guide your thoughts accordingly, and you’ll discover that without even realizing it, that you’ve been harboring resentments, feeling unworthy and feeling powerless. But now that you’ve decided to pay attention to your emotions, these resistant illness producing thoughts will no longer go unnoticed. It’s not natural for you to be sick. And it’s not natural for you to harbor negative emotion. For at your core you’re like your Inner-Being – you are well and you feel very very good. 98. But could a baby’s thoughts attract disease? Jerry: How could a new baby, that has no conscious awareness of disease, how could they attract the disease? Abraham: First we want to state unequivocally that no one is creating your reality other than you. But it’s important to realize that the “you” that you know as you, did not begin as that small infant born to your mother. You are an eternal being, having lived many experiences. You came forth into this physical body from a long background of creating. People often think that it would be a much better world if all new-born babies could be born meeting all of the standards of a perfect physical"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"105 body. But that’s not necessarily the intention of every being who comes forth in to a physical body. There are many beings, who, because the contrast creates an interesting effect that proves valuable in many other ways, deliberately intend to very from what is normal. In other words, you just cannot assume that something has gone wrong when babies are born with differences. Imagine an athlete who’s become very good at playing tennis. People sitting course-side watching the match may assume that this player would be happiest always playing against an opponent with less skill, who she can easily beat. But the athlete may very well prefer exactly the opposite. She may prefer people who are at the top of their game, who draw forth from her focus and precision that’s not been drawn before. And in like manner, many who are at the top of their game in physical creating, want opportunities to view life differently, so that new options can be evoked, and new experiences can be lived. And these beings also understand that there can be tremendous benefit to those who are close by, when something different from what is normal is being experienced. People often incorrectly assume that since the baby cannot speak, it could not be creating its own reality. But that is not the case. Even those who do have language, are not creating through words, but through thoughts. Your babies are thinking when they’re born, and before they’re born, they are vibrationally aware. Their vibrational frequencies are immediately affected by the vibrations that surround them in their birth environment. But there is no need to worry about them, for they, like you, were born with the guidance system to help them to discern the difference between the offering of beneficial thoughts and the disallowing of Well-Being thoughts. 99. Why have some been born with illnesses? Jerry: So, when you’re speaking of the balance of thought, are you saying the balance of thought even from before we’re born? In other words, would that be why someone could be born with a physical problem? Abraham: It is. But just as the balance of your thought now is equaling what you’re living, the balance of thought that you held prior to your birth is also what equaled what you’re living. But you must understand that there are those who’ve come forth deliberately wanting physical disability, because they wanted the benefit that they knew would come from it. They were wanting to add some balance to their perspective."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106 Before you came into this physical body, you understood that from wherever you stand, you can make a new decision about what you want. And so, there was no concern about your starting place in your physical body, because you knew that if that condition inspired a desire for something different, the new desire was attainable. There are many people who have achieved tremendous success in many areas of life who are born into conditions that would be considered to be the extreme opposite of success. And those raw and ragged beginnings served them extremely well, because born out of that poverty, or dysfunction, was strong desire which was the beginning of the asking that was necessary before success could begin to flow to them. All beings who come forth into a physical body have full understanding of the body they are coming in to. And you may trust that if they came forth, and remain, it was their intention from nonphysical to do so. And without exception, when where you’re currently standing causes you to make another decision about what you now desire, you have the ability, if you focus your thought, to accomplish the essence of that creation. Most who are attracting less than Wellness, are doing so by default. They may very well desire Wellness, while the majority of their thoughts are upon subjects that do not support Wellness. It’s not a good idea to stand in your perspective and try to evaluate the appropriateness of what anyone else is living, because you will never be able to figure it out. But you always know where you stand relative to what you are wanting. And if you will pay attention to what you’re thinking, and let your thoughts be guided by the feeling that comes forth from within you, you will find yourself guiding your thoughts more of the time in the direction of that which will ultimately please you. 100. Let’s discuss the concept of “incurable” diseases There is not a physical apparatus, no matter what the state of deterioration, that cannot achieve perfect health. But that which you believe has everything to do with what you allow in your experience. If you’ve been convinced that something is not curable, that it’s fatal, and then you’re told that you have it, usually your belief will be that you will not survive. And so, you will not. But your survival has nothing to do with the disease and everything to do with your thoughts. And so, if you say to yourself, “That may be true for others, but it’s not true for me, because I am the creator of my experience, and I choose recovery, not death at this time”, you can recover. We know, that these words are easily said by us and not so easily heard by those who do not believe in their power to create. But your experience always reflects the balance of your thoughts."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"107 Your experience is a clear indication of the thoughts that you think. When you change the thoughts you are thinking, your experience, or indicator, must change also. It is Law. 101. Focus on fun to regain one’s health Jerry: Abraham, there was an author who’d contracted a disease that was considered to be incurable. But he survived it. And he said he was able to do so by watching a serious of humorous television programs. I understand, he just watched those programs and laughed, and the disease went away. What would you say was behind his recovery? Abraham: His recovery was accomplished because he achieved vibrational alignment with Well- Being. There are two primary factors involved in his finding vibrational alignment. First, his desire for Wellness was dramatically enhanced by his illness. And second, the programs he watched distracted him from the illness. The pleasure that he felt as he laughed at the humor of the program was his indication that his disallowance of Well-Being had ceased. Those are the two factors required in the creation of anything – want it and allow it. Usually once people have focused upon problems and such, enough that they’ve disallowed their Well-Being, and they’re seriously ill, then they turn their undivided attention to the illness, thus perpetuating it more. Sometimes a doctor can enhance your belief in Wellness, if he has a process or a remedy that he believes will help you. And in that case the desire is amplified because of the illness, and the belief is enhanced because of the proposed remedy. But in the case of the supposedly incurable disease or in the case of the supposedly curable disease, the two factors that brought about the healing were the same – desire and belief. Anyone who can come to expect Well- Being can achieve it under any conditions. The trick is to expect Well-Being, or, as the man in your example did, simply distract yourself from the lack of Well-Being. 102. Did ignoring the illness resolve the illness? Jerry: I’ve noticed that throughout my adult life, I’ve never been so sick I wasn’t able to do the work I intended to do that day. In other words, I always felt my work was so important that I didn’t consider not doing it. I noticed, however, that if I was beginning to feel less than good, like if I was in the beginning stages of cold or flu, once I got focused on what I needed to do in terms of my work, the symptoms went away. Is that because I was focused on something that I wanted?"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108 Abraham: Because you had a strong intention to do your work, and because you enjoyed it when you did it, you had the advantage of a strong momentum toward your Well-Being. So, when it seemed that something was distracting from that Well-Being, because of some attention to something unwanted, you had only to focus upon your usual attention, and your alignment returned quickly. And the symptoms of misalignment faded quickly. Often you try to accomplish too much through action, and in doing so, you feel tired, or overwhelmed. And those feelings are your indicator that it’s time to stop and refresh. But often you push forward in action, rather than taking the t ime to refresh and realign, and that’s a very common reason for uncomfortable symptoms to begin to surface. Most people, when they feel a symptom of sickness, begin to give their attention to the symptom, and usually slide rapidly into more discomfort and misalignment. The key is to catch your misalignment early. In other words, whenever you feel negative emotion, that’s your signal to reach for a different thought to improve your vibrational balance. But if you do not, your signal will get stronger, until eventually you may feel physical discomfort. But even then, as in the example you just stated, you can still refocus on something that you desire, taking your attention from whatever has you out of balance, and come into alignment, and the symptoms of sickness must then leave. There is no condition from which you cannot recover. But it is much easier, if you catch it in the early subtle stages. Sometimes being sick provides you in escape from something else that you do not want to do. And so, in your environment there is much allowing of sickness for the sake of not having to do something else. But when you begin playing that sort of game with self, you’re opening the door to greater and greater and greater sickness. 103. What’s the effect of vaccines on diseases? Jerry: Abraham, since we create our illnesses through thought, then why do vaccines seem to almost put an end to the spread of those particular kinds of diseases? Abraham: The illness amplifies your desire, and the vaccine amplifies your belief. Therefore, you’ve accomplished the delicate balance of creation – you want it, and you allow it, or believe it – and so it is."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"109 104. What about medical doctors, faith healers and witch doctors? Jerry: People like witch doctors and faith healers and medical doctors, all of them have a reputation for healing some people and for losing some of their patients too. So what do you see the place for such people in thought or in life? Abraham: The important thing that all of those have in common is that they stimulate belief in their patience. The first part of the balance of creation has been accomplished, because the illness has enhanced the desire for Wellness. And anything that brings about belief or expectation will give posit ive results. When medicine and science stop looking for cures and begin to look for vibrational causes, or imbalances, they will see a much higher rate of recovery. If a doctor does not believe that you can recover from your illness, your association with that doctor is extremely detrimental. And often well meaning doctors will defend their doubt for your recovery by pointing out the odds against it, telling you that it’s not likely that you will be an exception. The trouble with that logic, even though it’s based on the facts or evidence that medicine and science have come to expect, is that it has nothing to do with you. There are only two factors that have anything to do with your recovery: your desire and your belief. And this negative diagnosis is hindering your belief. And so, if you have a strong desire for recovery, and doctors are giving you no hope, it is logical that you would turn to alternative approaches, where hope is not only allowed, but encouraged. For there is much evidence to show that people can recover from supposedly “incurable” diseases. 105. Your physician as a means to Well-Being Do not condemn your modern medicine, for it has been created because of the thoughts, desires and beliefs of the members of your society. But we want you to know that you have the power to accomplish anything that you desire. But you cannot look outside of yourself for the validation to do so. Your validation will come from within you in the form of emotion. Seek your vibrational alignment first, and then follow through with inspired action. Let your medical community assist you in your recovery, but do not ask them to do the impossible – don’t ask them to give you a cure to compensate for your misaligned energy. Without asking there can be no answering. And attention to a problem really isn’t asking for a solution. So, it’s not unusual that doctors would be examining the physical body, looking for problems, for which they might have a solution. But looking for problems is a powerful catalyst for"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110 attracting them. And so, often well-meaning doctors are instrumental in perpetuating more illness than they are able to find cures for. We’re not suggesting that they are not wanting to help you, we’re saying that their dominant intent, when they examine you, is to find some evidence of something wrong. And since that is their dominant intent, that is more of what they will attract than anything else. In time, after they’ve been involved in it for a period of time, they begin to believe in the fallibility of man. They begin to notice more of what is wrong than what is right, and that is the reason that so many of them begin to attract illness into their own experience. Jerry: Is that the reason that so often physicians can’t heal themselves? Abraham: That is the reason. It is not easy to be focused upon others’ negatives, without experiencing the negative emotion within your own being. And illness exists because of the allowance of negativity. One who never experiences negativity, will not be sick. 106. What can I do to help them? Jerry: So what’s the best thing that I, as an individual, could do for other people that are having physical problems? Abraham: You never help others when you allow yourself to be a sounding board for their complaints. Seeing them as you know they want to be is the most valuable thing you can do for them. Sometimes that means removing yourself from their vicinity, because when you’re near them, it’s difficult not to notice their complaints. You might say to them, “I’ve learned the power of my attention and thought. And so, as I hear you speaking of what I know you don’t want, I must tell you that I must remove myself, for I don’t want to contribute to your miscreating”. Try do distract them from their complaints. Try to help them focus upon some positive aspects. Do your best to imagine their recovery. You will know when you are of value to anyone when you are able to think about the person and feel good at the same time. When you love others without worry, you are an advantage to them. When you enjoy them, you help them. When you expect them to succeed, you help them. In other words, when you see them as your own Inner-Being sees them, then and only then is your association with them to their advantage."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"111 107. But what if they are in a coma? Jerry: Is there anything we can do for a loved one who is in one of those sort of unconscious states? Abraham: You are communicating with those around you vibrationally even more than with your words. So, even though your loved one may show no signs of recognition, it does not mean that your communication is not being received on some level. You can even communicate with those who have made their physical transitions in what you call ‘death’. So, do not assume that a seeming unconscious state has barred your communication. The primary reason why people remain in a coma, or unconscious state, is that they’re seeking refreshment from the lackful thoughts that have been hindering them. In other words, while they have withdrawn their conscious attention from the details of their normal life, they are in a state of vibrational communication with their own Inner-Being. It’s an opportunity for refreshment and it’s often a time of decision making, where they’re actually determining whether they’ll find their alignment by returning to the nonphysical or whether they’ll awaken again back into their physical body. In many regards, it’s not very different from being born into the physical body in the first place. Here is the best attitude for you to hold regarding such people: “I want you to do what’s important to you. I approve of whatever you decide. I love you unconditionally. If you stay, I will be ecstatic. And if you go, I will be ecstatic. Do what is best for you”. That’s the best you can do for them. Jerry: And so, those people who are in a state like that for many years, they’re actually doing what they want to do? Abraham: Most of them, if it’s that length of time, made the decision not to return long ago. And someone in the physical overrode their decision and kept them plugged into a machine. But their consciousness has long gone, and will not return to this body. 108. Could I inherit my grandmother’s illness? Jerry: Don’t some people actually inherit physical problems? Abraham: What appears to be inherited tendencies is usually the LOA’s response to the thoughts that you learned from your parents. However, the cells of your body are thinking mechanisms also, and your cells, like you, can learn vibration from those around them. However, when you identify a"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112 desire, and you find thoughts that feel good, which indicate that you’re in vibrational alignment with your Inner-Being or Source, the cells of your body will quickly align to the vibration of Well- Being that your positive thought has established. The cells of your body cannot develop negative tendencies that lead to disease when you are in alignment with your Source. Your cells can only get out of alignment when you are. Your body is an extension of your thought. Your contagious, or so called inherited, negative symptoms are supported by your negative thought, and could not occur in the presence of chronically positive thoughts, no matter what diseases had been experienced by your parents. Jerry: So, if I hear my mother speak of her headaches, and I accept that, then I can start having headaches myself? Abraham: Whether you heard it from your mother, or from another, your attention to something you do not want will in time bring the essence of it to you. The headache is a symptom of resistance to Well-Being, which occurs when you hold yourself in vibrational contradiction to the Well-Being of your Inner-Being. For example, worrying about work or feeling angry at your government can cause physical symptoms. You do not have to focus upon a headache to have one. Jerry: Well then, if I hear my mother complain of headaches, and I consciously reject that, and say, “Well, that may be true for you, but that’s not for me”, does that in some way protect me? Abraham: It’s always to your advantage to speak of what you want. But you cannot stay in alignment with who-you-really-are and focus upon your mother’s headache at the same time. Speaking of what you do want while looking at what you do not want does not put you in alignment with what you do want. Take your attention from the things you do not want to attract, and put them upon the things you do want to attract. Focus upon some aspect of your mother that causes you to feel good, or focus upon something other than your mother that causes you to feel good. 109. What is the media’s role in epidemics? Jerry: Now, I’ve been hearing in the media recently that there are free flu shots in town for those who wanna go and get them. Will that news affect the spread of the flu virus in any way? Abraham: Yes, it will be of great value to the spread of the flu virus. There is no greater source of negative influence in your environment today than your television. Of course, as in every part of"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"113 your environment, there is wanted and unwanted. And you do have the ability to focus and therefore receive value from your television and media. But those sources do bring you a tremendously distorted imbalanced point of view. They look all around your world for pockets of trouble, shining spotlights upon them and magnifying them, and enhancing the trouble with dramatic music, and then funneling them into your living rooms, giving you a tremendously distorted picture of the trouble vs. the Well-Being of your Planet. The constant barrage of medical commercials is a powerful source of negative influence. As they explain to you that 1 out of 5 people has this disease lurking, and you’re probably the one, they influence you to give thought. And then they say, “See your physician”. And when you go to your physician, remember, the intent of the physician is to find something wrong. Now your negative expectation is born, or enhanced. And with enough of that influence your body begins to manifest the evidence of those pervasive thoughts. Your medicine is more advanced today than ever before, and yet more of you are sick than ever before. Remember, to create anything, you have only to give thought to it and then expect it, and it is. They show you the statistics, they tell you the horror stories, they stimulate your thought, and as you’re being stimulated by the thought in great detail, you have the emotion (the dread, or the fear) “I don’t want that”. And one half of the equation is complete. Then they encourage you to go in for a check-up, or to come and get the free flu shot (“Obviously we know it’s an epidemic or we wouldn’t be offering the free flu shots”), and that completes the expectation, or the allowing, part. And now you’re in the perfect position for the receiving of the flu, or the essence of whatever it is that they’re talking about. You get what you think about, whether you want it or not. And so, it’s of great value for you to begin practicing your own story about your Well-Being, so that when the television presents that frightening story, one that you do not want to live, you can hear their version and feel humor about it rather than fear. 110. Catch uncomfortable sensations while they’re small The first indication that you’re disallowing your physical Well-Being comes to you in the form of negative emotion. You will not see a breakdown of your physical body at the first sign of negative emotion, but focusing upon subjects that cause a prolonged feeling of negative emotion will eventually cause disease. If you’re unaware that the negative emotion indicates the vibrational disharmony that is hindering the level of Well-Being that you’re asking for, you may be like most people accepting a certain level of negative emotion and feeling no need to do something about it."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"114 Most people, even when they feel alarm at the level of negative emotion or stress they’re feeling, do not know what to do about it, because they believe they’re reacting to conditions or circumstances that are outside of their control. And so, since they can’t control the unpleasant conditions, they feel powerless to change the way they feel. We want you to understand that your emotions come in response to your focus. And under all conditions you have the power to find thoughts that feel slightly better or slightly worse. And when you consistently choose slightly better, the LOA will bring steady improvement to your experience. The key to achieving and maintaining a physical state of Well-Being is to notice the indicators of discord in the early stages. It’s much easier to refocus your thoughts in the early subtle stages than after the LOA has responded to chronic negative thoughts bringing bigger negative results. If you could make a decision to never allow negative emotion to linger within you, and at the same time acknowledge that it’s your work alone to refocus your attention in order to feel better, rather than asking someone else to do something different or for some circumstance to change to make you feel better, you will not only be a very healthy person, but you will be a joyful person. Joy, appreciation, love and health are all synonymous. Resentment, jealousy, depression, anger and sickness are all synonymous. 111. Are arthritis and Alzheimer’s disease somehow resolvable? Jerry: Is it possible to recover from those kinds of illnesses at whatever age a person’s at? Abraham: The conditions of your body truly are vibrational indicators of the balance of your thoughts. And so, when you change your thoughts, the indicators must change also. The only reason that some diseases seem stubborn and unchangeable is because your thoughts are often stubborn and unchanging. Most people learn their patterns of counterproductive thought often based on truths they’ve witnessed or learned form others. And as they hold stubbornly to those patterns of thought, which do not serve them, they then experience the results of those thoughts. And then an uncomfortable cycle occurs, where they think about unwanted things - valid, true unwanted things,- and in doing so, by the LOA they prevent wanted things from coming into their experience, and allow unwanted things to come instead, then they focus even more on those unwanted things, causing more unwanted things to come. You can accomplish change in every experience, but you have to begin to see your world differently. You have to tell the story the way you want it to be rather than like it is. When you"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"115 choose the direction of your thoughts and conversations by the way they feel as you think them or speak them, then you begin to deliberately offer vibrations. You are vibrational beings, whether you know it or not. And the LOA is eternally responding to the vibrations you are offering. Jerry: Can chemicals, such as alcohol, nicotine or cocaine, negatively affect our body? Abraham: Your physical Wellness is affected much more by your vibrational balance than it is by the things that you put into your body. And even more significant to your question is the fact that from your place of vibrational alignment you would not feel inclined toward any substance that would detract from that balance. Almost without exception, the seeking of those substances comes from a place of less alignment. In fact, the impulse to participate in those substances comes from a desire to fill the void that is present because of the vibrational imbalance. 112. Are exercise and nutrition a health factor? Jerry: Does better nutrition or more exercise add to our health? Abraham: You may have noticed that there are those who are very deliberate about food and exercise, whose physical Well-Being is obvious. And there are those who seem to be offering tremendous effort regarding food and exercise, who struggle for years to gain benefit, and still have no success in maintaining their physical Well-Being. What you do in terms of action is far less important than the thoughts you think, the way you feel, your vibrational balance, or the story you tell. When you take the time to find vibrational balance, the physical effort you apply will yield you wonderful results. But if you do not tend to your vibrational balance first, there’s not enough action in the world to compensate for that misaligned energy. From your place of alignment you will feel inspired to the beneficial behavior, just as from your place of misalignment you are inspired to detrimental behavior. The reason that so many are confused about the correct behavior for healthy living is because they’re only factoring in behavior, and they’re leaving out the part of the equation that’s most responsible for every outcome – the way you think, the emotions you feel and the story you tell."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"116 113. What if a healthy person feels mostly tired? Jerry: If a person seems to be in good health, but feels tired or listless most of the time, what would you suggest as a solution for that? Abraham: People often refer to that state of being tired, or listless, as a state of low energy, and that’s really a good way of saying it. While you cannot cut yourself off from your Energy Source, when you offer thoughts that contradict that Source, your resulting feeling is one of resistance, or low energy. The way you feel is always about the degree to which you are in alignment or out of alignment with your Source. No exceptions. As you tell the story of what you want, which is the story the Source within you is always telling, you feel happy and energized. The feeling of low energy is always a result of telling a different story than the expanded Source Energy part of you is telling. When you tell a story that focuses upon the positive aspects of your life, you feel energized. When you tell a story that focuses upon the negative aspects, you feel enervated. When you focus upon the absence of something that you desire in your present experience, you feel negative emotion. When you imagine an improved condition, you feel positive emotion. The way you feel is always about the relationship between the object of your attention and your true desire. Giving thought to what is wanted will give you the invigoration that you seek. 114. What is the chief cause of illness? Illness is caused by giving thought to unwanted topics, feeling negative emotion but ignoring it, and continuing to focus upon unwanted such that negative emotion is getting greater, but still ignoring it and maintaining attention upon unwanted, until by the LOA still more negative thoughts and experiences are attracted. Illness exists when you disregard the early subtle signs of misalignment that come in the form of emotion. If you feel negative emotion and you do not change the thought to relieve the discomfort of the negative emotion, it always gets bigger, until eventually the negative emotion becomes physical sensation, then physical deterioration. However, the illness is only an indication of your"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"117 vibration. And whenever you change your vibration, the indicator will change to match the new vibration. Illness is nothing more than a physical indicator of energy out of balance. Many people who are experiencing illness disagree with our explanation of the cause of their illness being that the LOA is responding to their thoughts, as they protest that they have never thought about that particular illness. But illness does not occur because you’re thinking about that illness, or about any illness. Illness is an exaggerated indicator of negative thoughts, that began as a subtle indicator of negative emotion and grew larger as the negative thoughts persisted. Negative thought is resistance, no matter the subject of the negative thought. That is the reason that new diseases continue to come about. And until the actual cause of the disease is addressed, there will never be a final cure. You have the potential for every illness in your body right now, and you have the potential for a perfect state of health in your body right now. And you will solicit one or the other, or a mixture, depending upon your balance of thought. Jerry: So, from your perspective, there is no physical cause for illness or disease, it’s all about thought? Abraham: We understand your urge to give credence to action or behavior in attempting to explain causes. As you explain where your water comes from, you would be accurate to point to the faucet as the source of water coming into your kitchen sink, but there is much much more to the story of where the water comes from than only the faucet. And in like manner, there is much much more to the story about the source of Wellness or of illness. Your ease or dis-ease are symptoms of the balance of your thought. And that balance will manifest through the path of least resistance as surely as water flows downhill. 115. An example of my “old” story about my physical Well-Being Let us give you an example of an “old” story about your physical Well-Being: “I am noticing symptoms in my body that worry me. As I get older, I feel less strong, less stable, less healthy, less secure. I worry about where I’m headed health-wise. I‘ve tried to take care of myself, but I don’t see that it has helped that much. I guess it’s just normal to feel worse as time goes on. I saw that with my parents, so I’m really worried about my health”."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118 116. An example of my “new” story about my physical Well-Being Here’s an example of your “new” story about your physical Well-Being: “My body responds to my thoughts about it, and to my thoughts about everything I think about. The better my thoughts feel when I think them, the more I allow my personal Well-Being. I like knowing that there is an absolute correlation between how I feel and what my chronic thoughts have been, and how those thoughts felt as I thought them. I like knowing that those feelings are meant to help me choose better feeling thoughts, which produce better feeling vibrations, which will produce a better feeling body. My body is so responsive to my thoughts, and that is such a good thing to know. I’m getting rather good at choosing my thoughts. No matter what condition I find myself in, I have the power to change it. My state of physical health is simply an indication of the state of my chronic thoughts. I have the control of both. A physical body is an amazing thing, in the way it began as a glob of fetal cells to become this full blown human body. I’m impressed with the stability of the human body, and the intelligence of the cells that make up the human body, as I notice how my body accomplishes so many important functions without my conscious involvement. I like that it’s not my conscious responsibility to move the blood through my veins, or the air through my lungs. I like that my body knows how to do that, and does it so well. The human body in general is quite an amazing thing. An intelligent, flexible, durable, resilient, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching thing. My body serves me very well. I love my exploration of life through my physical body. I enjoy my stamina and flexibility, I like living life in my body. I’m so pleased with my eyes that look out into this world, seeing near and far from where I stand, distinguishing shapes and colors with such vivid perception of depths and distances. I so enjoy my body’s ability to hear and smell and taste and feel. I love the tactile sensual content of this planet and my life in this wonderful body. I feel appreciation and fascination for my body’s self-patching ability as I watch wounds cover over with new skin, and as I discover new resiliency when traumas to my body occur. I’m so aware of my body’s flexibility, my fingers’ dexterity, and the immediate response that my muscles show to any task I attempt. I like understanding that my body knows how to be well and is always moving toward Wellness, and that as I do not get in the way of that, with negative thought, Wellness must prevail. I like understanding the value of my emotions. And I understand that I have the ability to achieve and maintain physical Well-Being because I have the ability to find and maintain happy thoughts. On any day in this world, even when some things in my body may not be at their best, I’m ever aware, that far far far far more things are functioning as they should, and that the aspects of Well-Being of my body are dominant. And, most of all, I love my body’s quick response to my attention and intentions. I love understanding my mind-body-spirit"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"119 connections and the powerful productive qualities of my deliberate alignment. I love living life in my body. I feel such appreciation for this experience. I feel good”. There is no right or wrong way to tell your improved story. It can be about your past, your present or future experiences. The only criterion that is important is that you be conscious of your intent to tell a better-feeling improved version of your story. Telling many good-feeling short stories throughout your day will change your point of attraction. Just remember, the story you tell is the basis of your life. So tell it the way you want it to be."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"120 Part IV. Perspectives Of Health, Weight, And Mind 118. I want to enjoy a healthy body Bringing your physical body into alignment is a tremedously valuable thing to do for two reasons: (1) there is no subject that people think about more than their own body. And that‘s logical, since you take it with you everywhere you go; (2) since every perspective or thought that you have flows through your lense of your physical body, your attitude on virtually every subject is influenced by the way you feel about your physical body. Because science and medicine have been slow to acknowledge the connection between mind and body, between thoughts and outcomes, between attitudes and resuts, most people are reeling in a plethora of contradictory guidance relative to their bodies. Whenever the basis of an understanding is flawed, no amount of patching it with methods or potions or remedies can bring consistently provable results. And because the alignment of Energies for each individual varies because of such a variety of factors in belief, desires, expectations, and early and current influencies, it‘s little wonder that remedies that work every time are non-existent. And it‘s no wonder that most are truly confused about their physical bodies. When you attempt to gather and process information about what‘s happening with other people‘s bodies, instead of using your own emotional guidance system to understand your current alignment or misalignment of Energy, it‘s tantamount to using a road map from a different country to plan your route in your own country. That information simply has no bearing on you and where you are right now. You‘ve been given so much information that is contradictory to that which we know to be and to the Laws of the Universe, that we‘re extremely happy to talk to you about you and your body relative to the greater picture. We want to assit you in finding a clear understanding of how to be a healthy being, who is physically fit, who looks as you want to look, whole in terms of mind and spirit and body. When you use your mind to deliberately focus your thoughts to align with the thoughts of your Inner-Being, or Spirit, your physical body will be the manisfestational evidence of that alignment."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"121 119. I want to balance my desires and experiences It is not possible to bring your physical body to a state of perfect health by only thinking about the physical aspects of your being, and then offering action regarding your physical body. Without an understanding of the connection bewteen the physical you and the nonphysical vibrational Inner You, there can be no consistent understanding or control. In other words, while it may feel to you that the path to a good-feeling good-looking body will be a result of your behaviour, in terms of food intake and activity, it is really much more about your vibrational alignment between the physical and nonphysical aspects of your being. Once you accept the totality of your being and you make that vibrational alignment your top priority, you are well on your way to achieving and maintaining your desired physical body. But if you use conditions of others, experiences of others and opinions of others as your gage for wellness, you will not be able to control the condition of your own physical body. In other words, as you strive for a physical standard, based on comparison with the experiences of others, rather than striving for your own personal alignment between you and you, you will never discover the key to control over your own body. 120. I needn‘t compare my body to others We would like to assist you in understanding that there is not one state of being that is the correct one, or even the most wanted one. For there are a great many varieties of states of physical bodies that have been intended by you as you emerged into this physical body. If it had been your intent to all be the same, more of you would be the same. But you are not. You come forth with all sorts of varieties of size and shape and flexibility and dexterity. Some are stronger and others are more agile. You come with great variety and in all sorts of differences that are of tremendous advantage to the whole. You came forth in your great variety to add balance to this time and place. And so, we would like to encourage you, rather than looking at yourselves and acknowledging that you are lacking in this or that characteristic, as most of you do, we would like to assist you in looking toward the advantages of that which you are. In other words, as you are assessing or analyzing your physical body, spend a greater part of your time looking for the advantages that it offers not just to you but to the balance of All-That-Is. 121. What if I saw myself as perfect? We are not necessarily encouraging you to look at whatever your current state is and proclaim it as perfect. Because you will always be striving for something that‘s just beyond what-is. But finding"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"122 aspects of your current experience that feel good when you focus upon them will cause you to align with the perspective of your Inner-Being, who is always focused upon your Well-Being. We encourage you to feel for the agreement between your thoughts about your body and you Inner- Being‘s thoughts about your body, rather than trying to get the conditions of your body to agree with the conditions of other bodies that you see around you. 122. Pushing against unwanted attracts more of unwanted As you are understanding that you‘re creating through your thoughts rather than through your action, you will accomplish many more of your desires with far less effort. And in the absence of struggle you will have much more fun. You‘re offering thought in every waking moment, and so achieving a propensity to positive good-feeling thoughts will serve you extremely well. You were born into a society that began warning you against unwated things as soon as you arrived. And over time most of you have taken on a guarded stance. Most of you really believe that the way you get to what yo do want is to defeat what you do not want. And so you give so much of your attention toward pushing away from you what you do not want. Where if you could see LOA as we see it, if you could accept yourselves as the attractors by virtue of the thoughts that you are holding, you would understand what a backwards approach most of you are taking. As you say, „I‘m sick, and I want not to be sick, so I‘ll beat this illness. I‘ll take this action and I‘ll defeat this illness“, you are from your position of guardedness and defensiveness and negative emotion holding on to that illness. 123. My attention to lack attracts more lack Every subject is really two subjects: there is the subject of what you‘re wanting and there‘s the subject of its lack. Regarding your body, since every thought that you think is filtered through your perspective of this body, if this body does not feel the way you want it to feel, it is a very natural thing that a larger numer of your thoughts, a very imbalanced proportion of your thoughts, would be slanded toward the lack side of the equation rather than toward the truly desired side of the equation. From your place of lack you will attract only more of that. And that is the reason most diets do not work – you‘re aware of your fat, you‘re aware of the body looking the way you do not want it to look, and so, when it gets bad enough that you can‘t stand it anymore, either from your perspective or because others are scowling at you, then you say, „I can‘t bear this negative place"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"123 anymore. I‘m going on a diet and I‘m gonna get rid of all of this stuff that I do not want.“ And yet your attention is given to the stuff that you do not want, and so you hold it to you. The way to get where you want to be is to give your full attention toward what you do want, and to not give your attention to what you do not want. 124. Planting fear seeds does grow more fear Jerry: Abraham, a dear friend of mine voluntueered to be a part of the medical study. He said that even though he was in brilliant health, he was willing to participate in it if he could be of value to others, because so many men that were his age that time in that area were dying form this, whatever this disease was. Well, it seemed like only a matter of weeks before we received a message from him that he had been diagnosed with the illness. And now he is no longer in physical form. But he didn’t seem to have a fear of the disease. Did he create it in his body by merely focusing on it? Abraham: It was his attention to it. In other words, it was his intent to be of value for others, and so he allowed them to probe and poke and look, and in the probing and poking and looking he received enough stimulation of thought from the others to make him aware of the possibility. Not only the possibility, but the probability. They planted within him the seed of probability, and then with the probing and poking and looking his body responded to what then became the balance of his thought. It‘s a wonderful example that you‘ve offered, because that disease was not within him until the attention to the disease was within him. But once the attention to the disease was within him, then his body responded in kind. The potential for wellness or illness is always within you. The thoughts you choose determine which you experience and to what degree you experience it. 125. Must attention to illness attract illness? Jerry: How much can we actually toy with these thoughts of illness? For instance, a person can watch on television and offer to come down for free examination of some part of his or her body, and if the person says, „Oh, well, I think I‘ll just go do that. I feel fine, but why not, since it‘s free“, what are the chances of that leading to what you‘re talking about a stimulation of thought and eventually an unwanted result? Abraham: Nearly a 100 percent. Because of the attention to illness in your society your diseases are running rampant. With all of your medical technology, all of the tools, all of the discoveries, there"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"124 are more people who are critically ill today than ever before. The prevalence of so much severe illness is predominantely because of your attetion to illness. You say, „How much can we toy with it?“ And we say, you are very particular about what you eat and about what you wear, abuot what you drive, and yet you‘re not particular about what you think. We would encourage you to be particular about what you think. Keep your thoughts on the side of the subject that is in harmony with your wanting. Think about wellness, not about lack of it; think about being as you want to be rather than lack of it. Your illnesses are not born and perpetuated only because of your negative attention to illness. Remember, that illness stems from your feelings of vulnerability and guardedness. Train your thoughts on all subjects, not only the subject of physical health, in the direction of what you desire. And through the improved emotional state that you accomplish your physical Well-Being will then be assured. 126. Is my attention predominantly focused on Well-Being? The potential for illness or wellness lies within you at all times. And whatever you give your attention to begins to foster within you the manifestation of the essence of that thought. Thought is very powerful. When someone comes into your experience who stimulates your thought so that your thought is predominantely upon illness rather than wellness, upon lack of Well-Being rather than upon Well- Being, where you‘re in a place where you‘re feeling vulnerable or defensive, or even angry, then the cells of your body begin to respond to the balance of that thought. Everything that you are living is as a result of the thoughts that you‘re thinking. And there is not an exception to that. 127. Others’ physical evidence needn’t be my experience As you see physical evidence around you, very often that physical evidence seems more real to you than a thought. You say things to us such as, „Abraham, this is real. This isn‘t just a thought.“ As if what is really real and a thought are two separate things. But we want you to remember that the Universe does not distinquish between your thoughts of current reality and thoughts of imagined reality. The Universe and the LOA are simply responding to your thought, whether it is real or imagined, or whether it is current or remembered. Whatever evidence you‘re seeing around you is"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"125 nothing more than the manifestational indicator of someone‘s thought. And there‘s no reason for what others are creating with their thoughts to cause you to feel frightened or vulnerable. There is no such thing as an unchangable condition. There is not a physical situation, no matter what the state of negative degenaration, that cannot receive wellness. But it requires an understanding of the LOA, the guidance represented by emotion and a willingness to deliberately focus upon things that make you feel good. If you could understand that your body is responding to what you‘re thinking, and if you could hold your thoughts where you want them to be, all of you would be well. 128. How can I influence all toward maintaining health? The process for regaining health and maintaining health are one and the same – focus more upon things that feel good. The biggest difference between regaining and maintaining is that it‘s easier to think good-feeling thoughts when you feel good than when you feel bad. So, maintaining health is easier to do than regaining health. The best way to influence others to good health is to live it. The best way to influence others to sickness is to get sick. We understand that for those who are now in a place where they do not want to be sounds very simplistic to just find a better-feeling thought. But it is our absolute promise to you, that if you would be determined to imrpove the way you feel by deliberately choosing thoughts that feel better, you would begin to see immediate improvement in anything that‘s troubling you. 129. I’ll relax and sleep myself into Well-Being Your natural state is one of absolute Well-Being. You do not have to fight anymore against illness. Just relax into your wellness. Put yourself in your bed tonight, and as you‘re going to sleep, feel the wonderful comfort of the bed beneath you. Notice how big it is, notice the pillow beneath your neck, notice the fabrick upon your skin, give your attention to things that feel good. Because every moment that you can think about something that feels good, you‘re cutting the fuel to that illness. In every moment that you think about something that feels good, you‘re stopping the illness from going forward. And in every moment that you‘re thinking about the illness, you‘re adding a little more fuel to the fire, so to speak. As you‘re able to accomplish holding your thoughts on something that feels good for 5 seconds, then for that 5 seconds you‘ll stop fueling your illness. As you accomplish it for 10 seconds, then"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"126 for 10 seconds you‘ve stopped fueling the illness. As you think about how good you feel right now and as you think about your natural state as being a state of wellness, you begin fueling your wellness. 130. Do negative emotions indicate unhealthy thoughts? As you think thoughts of illness, the reason that you feel such negative emotion about it is because that thought is so out of harmony with your greater knowing that you‘re not resonating with who- you-really-are. The negative emotion that you feel, in the form of concern or anger or fear about your illness, is really your indicator that you‘ve put a very strong restriction on the flow of Energy between you and who-you-really-are. Your wellness comes forth as you allow the full flow of nonphysical energy from your Inner-Being. And so, as you think, „I am well“, or „I‘m becoming well“, or „I am whole“, It‘s my natural state to be well“, those thoughts vibrate in a place that is in harmony with that which your Inner-Being knows to be. And you receive the full benefit of the thought Energy that comes forth from your Inner-Being. Every thought vibrates. And so, focus upon thoughts that make you feel good, which will attract others and others and others and others, until your vibrational frequency will raise to the place that your Inner-Being can fully envelop you. And then you will be in the place of Well-Being, and your physical aparatus will catch up very quickly. It is our absolute promise to you. You may begin to watch for dramatic physical evidence of your recovery, for it is Law. 131. To what degree can I control my body? Your body and your mind are forever connected. Your body is responding to your thoughts continually. In fact, to nothing else. Your body is absolutely a pure reflection of the way you think. There‘s nothing else that affects your body other than your own thoughts. When you consciously acknowledge the absolute correlation between what you‘re thinking and what you‘re getting, you can then eventually under all conditions control your own experience. All that is required for you to get only what you want vs. getting some of what you do not want is to recognize that the control you seek you alerady have. And then to deliberately think about things you want to experience. Thoughts of decline always feel bad because you do not want decline. So, utilize your guidance and choose good-feeling thoughts, and you‘ll have no reason to worry about moving through time. Really, it‘s simply a matter of making the decision, „I want to acknowledge that I have the only and the absolute control of my physical aparatus. I acknowledge that I am as the result of the thoughts I think“."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"127 The day you were born you possessed knowledge, not hope or desire, but deep understanding, that your basis is absolute freedom, that your quest is joy and that the result of your life experience would be growth, or expansion. That day that you were born you knew that you were perfect and still reaching out for more perfection. 132. Can we consciously grow new muscle and bone? The reason that more things do not change more quickly in your society today is because most people are giving their attention predominantely to what-is. In order to affect change you must look beyond what-is. It slows you down tremendously if you need to see evidence of something before you believe it. Because that means you have to wait for someone else to create it before you can believe it. But when you understand that the Universe and the LOA will respond to your imagined idea as quickly as it responds to an observed idea, then you can move quickly into new creations without having to wait for someone else to accomplish it first. The leading-edge does require vision and positive expectation. But it is really where the most powerful exhilaration is. To be in a state of desire and to have no doubt is the most satisfying experience possible. But to want something and not believe in your ability to achieve it does not feel good. When you think only of what you desire without constant contradictions that are filled with doubt or disbelief, the Universal response to your desire comes quickly. And in time you begin to feel the power of your deliberate thought. But that kind of pure thought takes practise. And it requires that you spend less time observing what-is and more time visualizing what you‘d like to experience. In order to tell the new and improved story about your physical experience you have to spend time thinking and speaking about the experience you would like to live. The most powerful thing you can do, the thing that will give you much greater leverage than any action is to spend time every day visualizing your life as you want it to be. We encourage that you go to a quite and private environment for 15 minutes every day where you can close your eyes and imagine your body, your environment, your relationships, your life in ways that please you. What has been has nothing to do with what will be. And what others experience has nothing to do with your experience. But you must find a way to separate yourself from all of that – from the past and from others – in order to be what you want to be."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"128 133. What about when one’s desire overrules one’s belief? When people do not allow the fact that no one else has ever done something to prevent them from doing it, they are of great advantage to others. Because once they break through and create it, then others can observe and then in time they can come to believe or expect it themselves. And for that reason everything that you accomplish is of value to your society. Your platform for progressive living continues to expand and life does get better and better for everyone. But we want to take you beyond the need to see it before you can believe it. We want you to understand that if you believe it, then you will see it. Anything that you practice in your mind until the idea begins to feel natural to you, must come to physical fruition. The LOA guarantees that. You will feel enormous liberation when you realize that you do not have to wait for someone else to do something in order to prove that it can be done or before you can allow yourself to do it. As you practice new thoughts reaching for improved emotions and then see the evidence that the Universe will provide, you’ll come to know your own true power. If someone were to tell you that you are experiencing an incurable disease, you could then say with confidence, “ I will decide what I will live, because I am the creator of my experience.” We’d like to say to you that if your desire is strong enough, a strong desire can outweigh your negative belief, and your recovery will begin. 134. But what if I believe in dangerous germs? If you were really listening to your guidance system, you would not enter an environment where you believe there are germs that could compromise your Well-Being. The dread you feel about going into the hospital is your indicator that you’re about to take action before you have achieved vibrational alignment. You could just not go to the hospital, but then you would feel uncomfortable because you know your sick friend would enjoy a visit from you. So you find a way to visit your friend without feeling dread. And that’s what we mean by finding vibrational alignment before you take the action of entering the hospital. In time you can come to believe so much in your Well- Being, or your desire for Well-Being can become so vivid, that you could be in any environment and not feel a threat to your Well-Being. When you’re in alignment with who-you-really-are, and you’re listening to your powerful guidance system, you would never enter an environment where your Well-Being could be threatened. Unfortunately, many people override their guidance system for the sake of pleasing others."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"129 Two people could enter the hospital, one feeling no threat to Well-Being and the other feeling great threat. The first would not get sick. The second one would. Not because of the germs that are present in the hospital, but because of the person’s relationship to his own sense of Well-Being. We are not attempting to alter your beliefs, because we don’t see your beliefs as inappropriate. It is our desire to make you aware of your own emotional guidance system so that you can achieve the balance of vibration between your desires and your beliefs. Doing what you call the right thing means to do that which is in harmony with your intent and your current beliefs. There are many who override their own guidance system by trying to please others. And there are many people who will call you selfish or cowardly when you have the audacity to please yourself rather than them. Often others will call you selfish because you’re unwilling to yield to their own selfishness without even realizing the hypocrisy of their demand. Sometimes we are accused of teaching selfishness. And we admit that it’s true, because if you’re not selfish enough to tend to your own vibration, and hold yourself in alignment with your Source, with who-you-really-are, then you have nothing to give another anyway. When others call you selfish or cowardly, their own vibrations are clearly out of balance, and a modification of your behavior will not bring them into balance. The more you think and speak of your own physical Well-Being, the more entrenched your own vibrational patterns of wellness will be, and the more LOA will then surround you with things that enhance and support those beliefs. The more you tell your own story of Well-Being, the less vulnerable you’ll feel. And then not only will your point of attraction shift so that different situations will surround you, but you’ll also feel different about the situations as they come. 135. I am guided toward what I do like The only path to the life you desire is through the path of least resistance, or the path of most allowance, allowance of your connection to your Source, to your Inner-Being, to who-you-really- are, to all that you desire. And that allowance is indicated to you in the form of good-feeling emotions. If you will let feeling good be your most important priority, then whenever you’re having a conversation that is not in harmony with the health you desire, you’ll feel bad and so you’ll be alerted to your resistance. And then you can choose a better-feeling thought and then you’ll be back on track. Whenever you feel negative emotion, it is your guidance system helping you realize that you are in this moment offering resistant thought that is hindering the stream of Well-Being that would otherwise be reaching you fully. It’s as if your guidance system is saying, “Here, you’re"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"130 doing it again. Here, you’re doing it again. Here, you’re doing it again.” This negative emotion means you’re in the process of attracting what you don’t want. Many people ignore their guidance system by tolerating negative emotion and in doing so they deny themselves the benefit of guidance from broader perspective. But once life has caused you to identify that you desire something, you will never again be able to look at its opposite or at the lack of it without feeling negative emotion. Once a desire has been born within you, you must look at the desire if you’re to feel good. And the reason for that is, you cannot revert back to less than life has caused you to become. Once you identify a desire for wellness, or for a specific bodily condition, you will never again be able to focus upon the lack of it without feeling negative emotion. Whenever you feel negative emotion, just stop whatever it is you’re doing or thinking and say, “What is it that I do want?” And then because you’ve turned your attention to what you do want, the negative feeling will be replaced by a positive feeling, and the negative attraction will be replaced by positive attraction. And you’ll be right back on track. 136. First, I must be willing to please myself When you have been on a particular train of thought for a while, it is not easy to abruptly change the direction of your thought, because LOA is applying you with thoughts that match your current train of thought. Sometimes while you are in that negative feeling mode, another who is not in that negative place will not agree with your negative view of your current subject, which only serves to make you want to defend your position all the more. Trying to defend or justify your opinion only causes you to stay in your resistant state longer. And the reason so many people hold themselves in resistance unnecessarily is because it is more important to them to be right rather than to feel good. When you meet those who are determined to convince you that they are right and they try to hold you in a negative conversation in an attempt to convince you, sometimes you are considered uncaring or cold-hearted if you do not hear them and eventually agree with their point of view. But when you forfeit your good feeling that comes when you choose thoughts that harmonize with your broader perspective to try to please a negative friend who wants to use you as a sounding board, you’re paying a very big price for something that will not help your friend either. That uncomfortable knot in your stomach is your Inner-Being saying, “This behavior, this conversation isn’t in harmony with what you want”. You must be willing to please yourself first, or you’ll often be swept up by the negativity that surrounds you."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"131 137. Is there an appropriate time to die? Jerry: Abraham, are there any limits of control for our bodily conditions as we approach a 100 years of age? Abraham: Only the limitations caused by your own limited thinking, and all are self-imposed. Jerry: Is there a time to die? And if so, when is it? Abraham: There is never an ending to the consciousness of you, so there really is no death. But there will come an end to the time that your consciousness will flow through this particular physical body that you identify as you. It’s really up to you when you withdraw your focus from this body. If you’ve learned to focus upon good-feeling subjects and continue to find things in this environment that excite you and interest you, there is no limit to the amount of time that you can remain focused in your physical body. But when you focus negatively and chronically diminish your connection to the stream of Source Energy, your physical experience is then shortened, because your physical apparatus cannot sustain long-term without Source Energy replenishment. And your negative emotion is a signal that you’re cutting off this Source Energy replenishment. Get happy and live long. 138. Are all deaths a form of suicide? Since everything that you experience comes about because of the balance of your thought and no one else can think your thoughts or offer your vibration, then everything that happens in your experience, including that which you term your “physical death”, is self-inflicted. Most do not decide to die. They just do not decide to continue to live. It makes no difference whether the thought you’re thinking is one you’ve deliberately chosen to focus upon or whether you’re merely lazily observing something and therefore thinking the thought, you’re still thinking the thought. You’re still offering the vibration. And you’re still reaping the manifestational result of the thought. So, you’re always creating your own reality, whether you’re doing it purposefully or not. There are those who seek to control your behavior for many different reasons, who even wish to control your behavior regarding your own personal experience. But their frustration level is great because they have no way of controlling others, and every attempt at that control is futile wasted effort. And so, many are uncomfortable with the idea of someone deliberately removing themselves from this physical experience by way of suicide. But we want you to understand that even if you do that, you do not cease to exist. And whether you depart this"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"132 physical experience by way of deliberate suicide or by way of not deliberate release, the eternal being that you are continues to be and looks back on the physical experience you’ve just left behind only with love and appreciation for the experience. There are those who are filled with so much hatred as they live in their physical experience, that the chronic pinching off from Source and Well- Being is the reason for the death. There are those who simply no longer find interesting reasons to focus and remain, who turn their attention to the nonphysical, and that is the reason for their death. And there are those who have not come to understand energy, or thought, or alignment, who desperately want to feel good, and can find no way of stopping the chronic pain they’ve lived for so long, that they deliberately choose to re-emerge back into nonphysical. But in any case, you are eternal beings, who, once refocused into the nonphysical, become whole and renewed and completely aligned with who-you-really-are. You come forth intending to live and joyfully expand. When you disregard your guidance system, continuing to find thoughts that disallow your connection to your Source, you diminish your connection to your replenishing Source Energy Stream, and without that support you wither. 139. A process to manage one’s body weight? There are so many beliefs upon this subject, so many different methods have been tried, and most beings who are struggling with the control of body weight have tried many of those methods with little lasting success. And so, their belief is that they cannot control their body weight, and so they do not. We would encourage a visualization of self as you’re wanting to be, seeing yourself in that way, and thereby attracting it. The ideas and the confirmation from others, and all of the circumstances and events that will bring it about easily and quickly for you will then come into your experience once you begin to see yourself that way. When you feel fat, you cannot attract slender. When you feel poor, you cannot attract prosperity. That which you are, the state of being that you feel, is the basis from which you attract. That’s why the better it gets – the better it gets, and the worse it gets – the worse it gets. When you feel negative about something, don’t try to hammer it out and solve it immediately, because your negative attention to it just makes it worse. Just distract yourself from the thought until you feel better. And then take another run at it from your more positive fresh perspective. Jerry: Is that why people will often go on a crash diet and lose massive pounds, and then they’ll find themselves gaining it right back? Is it because the desire was strong, but they didn’t have the belief and the picture of themselves as this thin person, so they just filled the fat picture back in again?"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"133 Abraham: They want the food. They believe the food will make them fat. And so, as they’re giving thought to that which they do not want, in belief they create that which they do not want. But again, that’s going about it the hard way. For the most part the reason why they lose the weight and then gain it back quickly is that they’ve never really gained an image of themselves as they want to be. They keep feeling fat. They continue to think of themselves as that, and that’s the image that they hold. Your body responds to the image of self. Always. That’s why if you see yourself as healthy, you will be. If you see yourself as slender, or whatever it is that you want in terms of muscle or shape or weight, that is what you will be. 140. Regarding food, can I follow my bliss? Some have argued that if they do take our advice and follow their bliss, always looking for things that feel good, that they would happily eat things that are detrimental to their health or their body weight. People do often choose food to try to fill the void when they’re not feeling good. However, if you’ve been tending to your vibrational balance for a while, and you’ve learned the power of positively directing your thoughts toward an image of your body as you want it to be, then if you believe that eating a particular food is contrary to accomplishing that desire, negative emotion would come forth as guidance. It’s never a good idea to pursue any action that brings forth negative emotion, because the negative emotion means there is an energy imbalance. And any action that you participate in during negative emotion will always produce negative results. Negative emotion does not occur within a person because a particular food is contrary to Well- Being, but because of current contradictory thoughts. Two people could eat identical diets and follow similar exercise programs and get opposite results, which means there is much more to the equation than the consumption of food and the burning of calories. Your results are always and only about your alignment of Energy caused by the thoughts you think. A good rule of thumb is – get happy, then eat. But do not try to eat your way to happiness. As you come to make your emotional balance your top priority, your relationship with food will change and your impulse toward food will change. But even more important, your response to food will change. Altering behavior about food without tending to your vibration nets minimal results. While altering thought will yield great returns without the necessity of altering the behavior. And so, let’s say that you’ve decided that you want to be very slender. But you currently do not see yourself as you want to be. And your belief is, “If I eat this food, I will be fat”. As you have a desire"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"134 to be slender, but a belief that eating this food will make you fat, you would feel negative emotion if you begin to eat the food. You might call it guilt, or disappointment, or anger, but whatever it is, eating the food feels bad, because given the set of beliefs that you hold, and given the desire that you hold, this action is not in harmony. And so, if you’re following your bliss, you would find yourself feeling good about eating the things that do harmonize with your beliefs and bad about eating the things that do not. Once a desire has been established within you, it is not possible to offer behavior that you believe contradicts it without feeling negative emotion. 141. What are my beliefs about food? The beliefs that you hold regarding food are boldly reflected in the experiences that you’re living. For example, If you believe that you can eat most anything and not gain weight, that’s your experience; If you believe that you gain weight easily, then you do. If you believe that certain foods give you an energy boost, they do. If you believe that certain foods deflate your energy, they do. If you want to be slender but you believe that a particular diet is not conducive to being slender, and you take the action of eating that diet, you will gain weight. People often initially balk at our seemingly simplistic analysis of your beliefs about food and how they affect your physical reality, because they believe that their beliefs have come about by observing experience. And it’s hard for them to argue with the factual evidence that the living of their own life and the observation of other lives has provided them. However, observation of results gives you scanty and inadequate information, because unless you factor in desire and expectation, then calculating the action of what has or has not been eaten is irrelevant. You simply can’t leave out the most important ingredient in the recipe of creation and understand the outcome. People respond differently to the food because the food is not the constant. The thought is. It’s the way you’re thinking about the food that’s making the difference. 142. Opinions of others about my body are insignificant Whenever you’re using the word “other”, use the word “insignificant” regarding them. Of course, we understand that people in your life are significant, but you must not let their opinions of you be more important than your own. And any time anyone influences you to focus upon something that"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"135 makes you feel bad, you’ve received negative influence. We want you to practice your own thoughts so steadily that opinions of others do become irrelevant to you. The only freedom that you’ll ever experience comes when you achieve an absence of resistance, which means you will have figured out how to align your chronic thoughts with the thoughts of your Inner-Being. We’ve never seen anyone achieve that alignment or the feeling of freedom when they’re factoring the desires and beliefs of others into the equation. There are just too many moving parts and it cannot be sorted out. And so, if someone says to you, “I see something about you that I don’t like”, we’d say, “Look some place else. What do you think of my nose? Cute little thing, isn’t it? What about this ear over here?” In other words, we would encourage the other to look for positive aspects and we would be playful and not allow our feelings to be hurt. In fact, we would practice thoughts about our life until we reach the point that our feelings are unhurtable. 143. An example of my “old” story about my body Here’s an example of your old story about your body: “I’m not happy about the way my body looks. I have been trim and fit at times in my life but it’s never been easy, and those periods never lasted very long. Seems to me that I always had to work irrationally hard to get even close to the way I wanted to look. And then I couldn’t manage to stay there. I’m tired of depriving myself of good things to eat only to end up not looking good anyway. This is hard. I just don’t have the kind of metabolism that allows me to eat much of anything that tastes good. It’s really not fair. But I don’t like being fat either.” 144. An example of my “new” story about my body Here’s an example of a new story abut your body: “My body is a reflection mostly of the thoughts I think. I am happy to understand the power of directing my thoughts. And I’m looking forward to seeing physical changes in my body which reflect my changes in thinking. I feel good as I think about my improved size and shape. And I am confident that those changes are in progress. And in the meantime I’m generally feeling so good that I’m not unhappy with where I currently am. It’s fun to think on purpose, and even more fun to see the results of those deliberately chosen thoughts. My body is very responsive to my thoughts. I like knowing that.”"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"136 Remember, there is no right or wrong way to tell your improved story. It can be about your past or your present or your future experiences. The only thing that’s important is that you be conscious of your intent to tell a better-feeling improved version of your story. Telling many good-feeling short stories through your day will change your point of attraction. Remember, the story you tell is the basis of your life. So tell it the way you want it to be."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"137 Part V. Careers, As Profitable Sources Of Pleasure 146. My First Steps In Career Choice You are always inspired from the events of your life. And when you allow yourself to follow the flow of those inspired ideas, your potential for a joyous experience is much greater than if you were to select your career based on other reasons that people use to justify their choices, such as family tradition or income potential. It‘s not surprising that so many have a difficult time deciding what they will do for the rest of their lives, because you are multifaceted beings, and your dominant intent is to enjoy your absolute basis of freedom, and in your quest for joyful experience to then experience expansion and growth. In other words, without a real perception of freedom you will never be joyful. And without joy you can‘t experience true expansion. We encourage you to decide as early in life as possible that your dominant intent and reason for existance is to live happily ever after. That would be a very good career choice to gravitate toward those activities and to embrace those desires that harmonize with your core intentions, which are freedom and growth and joy. Make a career of living a happy life rather than trying to find work that will produce enough money that you can do things with your money that will then make you happy. When feeling happy is of paramount importance to you, and what you do for a living makes you happy, you‘ve found the best of all combinations. You can become very good at feeling good under all conditions. But when you become good at reaching for your vibrational balance first, and then attract circumstances and events to yourself from that happy place, your potential for sustained happiness is much greater. 147. “What Do You Do for a Living?” Most people do feel a need to justify their existance through effort or work. And that is perhaps the reason why the first question that you ask one another upon meeting for the first time is, „What do yo do for a living?“ When you are in vibrational alignment, which means that you‘re in alignment with the Source within you, and that your own desires and beliefs are in balance, you never feel a need to justify to another. Many people attempt to justify their behaviour or ideas to others, but it‘s never a good idea to use the opinions of others as the guide that you‘re seeking alignment with rather than your own guidance system. Many people early on in your experience attempt to demand your compliance"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"138 with their rules and opinions. But if you allow what they want to be central to the decisions that you make, you only get further and further out of alignment with who you really are and with the intentions that you were born with as well as those that have evolved from the life experience you‘re living. You will never experience the deliciousness of feeling free until you release your desire to please others and replace it with your powerful intenion to align with who-you-really-are, to your Source, by caring how you feel, and choosing good-feeling thoughts that let you know you‘ve found your alignment. When you sense that someone is disapproving of you, or attacking you, it‘s a natural response to defend yourself, but the need to defend will quickly subside when you‘ve trained yourself into alignment with your Inner-Being, because all feelings of vulnerability will have been replaced with that surefooted sense of who-you-really-are. No matter what choices you make, there will always be someone who does not agree with those choices. But as you find your balance and maintain your alignment, most who are observing you will be more inclined to ask you what your secret to success is rather than criticizing you for being successful. And those who continue to criticize you would find no satisfaction in your justification no matter how compelling your argument is. It is not your role to fix the feeling of lack within others. It is your role to keep yourself in balance. When you allow your society or even one other person to dictate to you what you should want or how you should behave, you‘ll lose your balance. Because your sense of freedom, which is core to your very beingness, is challenged. When you pay attention to the way you feel and you practice self-empowering thoughts that align with who-you-really-are, you will offer an example of thriving that will be of tremendous value to those who have the benefit of observing you. You cannot get poor enough to help poor people thrive or sick enough to help sick people get well. You only ever uplift from your position of strength and clarity and alignment. 148. The Law of Attraction and Career Those who are seeking prestige have replaced their own guidance system with seeking aproval from others. And that is rather unfulfilling way to live, because the onlookers you‘re seeking to please do not sustain long lasting attention upon you. Most people do care more about what others think about them than they do about how they personaly feel, but there is no consistency in that form of guidance."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"139 Some people worry that if they selfishly consider what makes them happy above all other things, they will be uncaring and unfair to those around them. But we know the opposite is true. When you care about your alignment with Source, which is represented by the way you feel, and you work to maintain your connection., anyone who is then your object of attention receives benefit from your gaise. You cannot uplift another unless you‘re connected to the Stream of Well-Being yourself. We understand that it can feel very good when others hold you as their object of attention as they‘re feeling appreciation for you, because they‘re then doing exactly what we were just explaining to you. In their appreciation of you they‘re connected to Source and showering it all over you. But to ask others to always be in alignment with Source and to always hold you as their object of attention so that you can be showered with the Well-Being they‘re providing, is not practicle. Because you cannot control their connection and you will not always be their only object of attention. You do, however, have absolute control over your own connection to Source. And when your dominant intent is to maintain your connection, while leaving others out of that equation, then you will be free of tryig to please others, which you cannot consistently do, and you will be able to maintain a consistent connection and feeling of Well-Being. An interesting thing to note is, those who care about how they feel, who consistently hold themselves in an attitude of good-feeling emotions, who are connected to Source and flowing positive thoughts outward toward whatever they‘re focused upon, are usually seen by others to be attractive, and they‘re often the recipients of much appeciation and approval. You just cannot get the approval you seek from the place of needing it or from the place of lack of it. An office with a wonderful window view, or a parking place with your name on it, or an impressive title attached to your name cannot fill the void caused by not being in alignment with who-you- really-are. When you achieve that alignment, those things feel less important, but then, interestingly enough, they come anyway. 149. Filling My Void Through Service? Jerry: During my 20 years in a wide variety of positions in the entertainment industry I really had a lot of fun. It required only a few hours of my time and I had a lot of adventurous challenges because I had so many new experiences. And yet I often told people that I felt like I was walking across the sands of life, but when I looked back, I wasn‘t leaving any tracks. In other words, I felt like I was"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"140 bringing my audiences some temperory pleasure, but I wasn‘t leaving them with anything of permanent value. Do we all inherently have those drives to uplift others? Do they come from some other level of ourselves? Or do we just pick up those intentions to make other people feel better from others around us once we‘ve been born into this physical environment? Abraham: You‘re born wanting to be of value, wanting to uplift. And you‘re born understanding that you have value. Most of that feeling of lack that you were describing was not about your not being able to provide lasting value to others, but because your thoughts were keeping you away from your own personal alignment. It works like this: when you‘re in alignment with who-you-really-are, with your Inner-Being, or Source, you cannot help but uplift those with whom you come into contact. And in that alignment you do not notice so many others who are not in alignment. The LOA does not surround you with dissatisfied people when you are satisfied. And the LOA does not surround you with satisfied people when you are dissatisfied. You simply cannot compensate for your own misalignment by offering more time or energy or action. You cannot find ideas that are effective enough to make up the difference. Your value to those around you hinges upon only one thing – your personal alignment with Source. And the only thing that you have to give another is an example of that alignment—which they may observe, and then desire, and then work to achieve—but you cannot give it to them. The entertainment that you provided to your audiences was actually a much bigger gift than you were able to acknowledge at the time, for you were providing distraction from troubling things. And in the absence of your audience members attention to their problems, they did achieve, in many cases, temporary alignment with Source. But you can’t go with each of them, holding yourself as their only object of attention, in order to maintain their good feeling. Everyone is responsible for the thoughts they think and the things that they choose as their objects of attention. All of you have deep within you an understanding that you‘re here as joyous creators, and you‘re always being called toward that fulfillment. But there is not a long list of requirements that you‘re expected to accomplish. Your intention was to let your physical environment inspire your neverending ideas of expansion or desire. And then you intended to align with the Source Energy within you for the achievement of those ideas. In other words, you knew your desires would be born from your participation here, and then once the desire was alive within you, you could focus your thoughts until you accomplished a feeling of expectation, and then your desire would come to fruit io n."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"141 The primary role that others arond you play in that equation for creation is, they provide variety from which your desires are born. It was not your intention to measure your value against the value of others, but to be inspired to new ideas by the combination of things going on around you. Any comparison to others is only meant to inspire expanded desire. It was never intended as a means to diminish you or to discount your value. Your life is not about what you will do after work, or on the weekend, or after you retire. Your life is happening now. And it is really represented by how you‘re feeling now. If your work feels unpleasant, or unfulfilling, or hard, it is not because you‘re standing in the wrong place, but because your perspective is clouded by contradicted thought. You cannot have a happy ending to a journey that has not been pleasant along the way. The end absolutely does not justify the means. The means, or the path along the way, always brings about the essence of an identical ending. 150. Will my success uplift others? Jerry: Abraham, my freedom has always been what was most important to me, so I’ve never been willing to give much of it up for money. I always said that I had very little interest in money because I wasn’t willing to give up my freedom for it. But then, over time that ‘leaving no footprints in the sand’ feeling made me question if there wasn’t really something more to life than just having fun. So, shortly after that awareness, I found the book “Think and grow rich”. And even though the idea of thinking or of growing rich was something that I would have denied having interest in, the book got my attention and I felt a strong draw toward it. I picked it up and the hair actually stood up on my body as if I’d found something that would have some major meaning in my life. The book said: make a decision about what you want. It was a seemingly simple statement, but I felt the power of it in a strange and new way. So, for the first time in my life I consciously started making decisions about what I wanted and writing them down: “I want to be self-employed, I want a business of my own, I want no place of business, I don’t want my foot nailed to the floor, I want no employees, I don’t want that kind of responsibility, what I want is freedom.” I wanted to be able to control my income. I wanted to be mobile so that I could travel or be anywhere that I wanted to be. I wanted my work to be something where every life I touched I elevated in some way or just let people be where they were, but that no one would ever be diminished as a result of knowing me."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142 People used to laugh when I’d tell them that. They’d say, “Oh, Jerry, you’re such a dreamer. There’s no such thing as that”. And I said, “Well, there has to be”. Emerson had said, “You wouldn’t have the desire if you didn’t have the ability to achieve it”. And I believed that. And so, I really expected somewhere along the line opportunities to show up. And so, within about 30 days of my clarifying what I wanted, I met a man who showed me a business that I could take to California and start, and that answered everything I was asking for. And so, for the next years of my life that business really took hold, and, again, it fulfilled the essence of everything that I’d written down that I wanted. 151. I want freedom, growth and joy Jerry: I didn’t say it had to be something I was capable of doing, or that I had the talent or the ability or the intelligence for. I just said, “This is what I want”. Can any of us have that? Can any of us have whatever we want once we clarify what it is we want? Abraham: Yes. If this life experience has inspired the desire within you, this life experience has the wherewithal to fulfill it down to the very last detail. You’d been coming to those decisions about what you wanted over a long period of time because of the life experiences that you’d been living. Your decision point of focusing upon those decisions and writing them down in a comprehensive manner caused an emphasizing of your belief regarding them. And when your desires and beliefs come together, expectation occurs. And once expectation for anything is within you, it then comes quickly into your experience. Being free was the most important element in the desires that you’d held for some time. And when you saw something that you believed would not threaten your desire for freedom, but had the potential of bringing income, you then allowed your desire for more income to expand, where previously anything that you perceived as having the potential to dampen your freedom, you repelled immediately. You are all born with the triad of intentions pulsing within you – freedom, growth and joy. Freedom is the basis of that which you are, because everything that comes to you comes in response to the thoughts you think. And no one has control over the thoughts that you think other than you. When joy is your dominant quest, so that you gently train your thoughts into alignment with who-you-"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"143 really-are, all resistance subsides. And then you allow the expansion, or growth, that your life experience has inspired within you. 152. I want my life to feel good When choosing a career or when doing the things that your work currently requires, if your dominant intent is to feel joy while you are doing the work, your triad of intentions will come quickly and easily into alignment, because in your accomplishment of feeling good you come into complete alignment with the broader Nonphysical aspects of your being. That alignment then allows the expansion toward all of the things that your life has helped you to identify that you want. So your growth becomes swift and satisfying. Freedom is the basis of your life experience. It’s not something that you have to earn. Joy is your objective. And growth is the result of all of that. But if you believe that you are unworthy and you set out to prove worthiness through action, you cannot find your balance. Often we explain this perfect triad of intentions of freedom and growth and joy. But most physical beings then turn their attention immediately to the idea of growth and their misguided attempt of proving worthiness, worthiness that has never been in question. You have nothing to prove to anyone, and nothing to justify. Your reason for existence needs no justification, for your very existence is justification enough. 153. I create my own joyous career We would like you to see your \"career\" as one of creating a joyful life experience. You are not a creator of things or a regurgitator of what someone else has created or a gatherer of stuff. You are a creator, and the subject of your creation is your joyful life experience. That is your mission. That is your quest. That is why you are here. 154. Is it immoral to get without giving? The question still implies that there is a price to pay for the Well-Being that flows to you. And that some sort of action is required to justify the flowing of the Well-Being. And that’s not the case. It’s not necessary or possible to justify the Well-Being that flows to you, but it is necessary to align with the Well-Being. You cannot focus upon lack of Well-Being and allow Well-Being into your experience. Many people focus upon unwanted things with no deliberate attention to the emotional"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"144 guidance within them, and then they try to compensate for their lackful thinking with physical action. And because of the misalignment of Energy they don’t get the results from their actions, so then they try harder offering more action, but still things don’t improve. Like the air you breathe, abundance in all things is available to you. Your life will simply be as good as you allow it to be. If you believe that you must work hard for the abundance that comes to you, then it cannot come without hard work. But in so many cases, the harder you work, the worse you feel, and the worse you feel the more you disallow the results that you wanted to receive from your hard work. It’s no wonder so many people are discouraged and do not know which way to turn. Because it seems that no matter what they do, they don’t thrive. Appreciation and love and alignment to that which is Source is the ultimate giving back, so to speak. In your pain or struggle you have nothing to give back. Many complain of unfairness or injustice when they see some people receiving greatly, but offering seemingly little effort, while others who work very hard, often show very little success. But the LOA is always consistently just. What you’re living is always an exact replicat ion of your vibrational patterns of thought. Nothing could be more fair than life as you’re living it. Because as you’re thinking - you’re vibrating, and as you’re vibrating – you’re attracting. And so you always get back the essence of what you’re giving. What most people are doing with most of their lives is offering action to try to compensate for vibrational imbalance. In other words, they think so much of things they do not want, and in doing so, they prevent what they do want from easily flowing into their experience. And then they try to compensate for the misalignment through action. If you would tend to your vibrational alignment first, by recognizing the value of your emotions, and trying to focus upon things that feel good, you would benefit tremendously by that alignment and wonderful things would flow to you with far less action. The majority of action that is offered today is offered amidst tremendous vibrational resistance. And that is the reason why so many people have come to believe that life is a struggle. It’s also the reason why many, like you, believe that success and freedom are at odds with one another, when in reality they are actually synonymous. It’s not necessary to take money out of the equation, but it is necessary that you make your quest for joy be the most dominant part of your equation. When you do that, abundance in all manner will flow to you."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"145 155. Welcome to Planet Earth If we were talking to you on your first day of physical experience, we could be of great advantage to you, because we would say, “Welcome to Planet Earth. There is nothing that you cannot be or do or have. And your work here, your life time career is to seek joy. You live in a Universe of absolute freedom. You are so free that every thought you think will attract unto you. As you think thoughts that feel good to you, you will be in harmony with who-you-really are. And so, utilize your profound freedom, seek joy first, and all of the growth that you could ever imagine will come joyously and abundantly unto you.” But this is not the first day of your life experience. In most cases, you’re hearing this long after you’ve been convinced that you’re not free, and that you’re unworthy and that you must prove through your action that you are worthy of receiving. Many of you are currently involved in careers or work that you do not find pleasing. But you feel that you cannot just walk away, because the financial repercussions would cause even greater discomfort than what you’re already experiencing. Many others who do not currently have work that is producing income feel the discomfort of having no means of support, or no promise of future security. But no matter where you’re currently standing, if you will make a decision to look at the positive aspects of where you are right now, you will stop the offering of resistance, which is the only thing that’s holding you apart from what you desire. You don’t have to go back and undo anything, or beat up on yourself for what you have not yet accomplished. If you could, in a sense, regard this moment as the beginning of your life experience, doing your best to resist the bad- feeling resistant thoughts of unworthiness, or resentment that often surround the subject of money, your financial picture would begin to change right now. You only have to say, “Here I am, on the first day of the rest of my physical life experience, and it is my dominant intent from this moment forward to look for reasons to feel good. I want to feel good. Nothing is more important to me than that I feel good.” 156. Most important is feeling good Often there are things in your work environment that are not conducive to feeling good, and often you believe that your only chance of ever really feeling good is to get away from those negative influences. But the idea of quitting and leaving does not feel good either, because that could cause a"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"146 lapse in your income, when things are already financially tight. So, you continue on unhappy and feeling trapped. If you could stand back a little bit, and see your career not as work that you’re doing in exchange for money, but as the expenditure of your life experience in return for your joyful experience, then you would realize that many of the thoughts that you think and the words that you speak are not in alignment with that quest for joy. If you’ll say, “Nothing is more important than that I feel good”, you will find yourself guiding yourself to different thoughts, words and behaviors. The simple exercise of deliberately looking for positive aspects of your current work, and the people who work there with you, will give you an immediate feeling of relief. And that relief will indicate a shift in your vibration, which means your point of attraction has shifted. Once that occurs, the LOA will cause you to rendezvous with different people, and even cause you to have different experiences with the same people. It is a sort of creating from inside out rather than the outside in action version that never works. From your simple but powerful premise of deciding that you want to feel good, things will begin to improve in dramatic ways. 157. What is holding back my career Jerry: Abraham, what would you say to those who are moving toward their first field of employment or are making a career change and are considering things like income or growth potential, product or service demand and so forth. What would you say to them in trying to decide what direction for them to take? Abraham: The life you have already lived has caused you to determine the details of the experience you’re looking for. And the perfect situation is already lined up for you. Your work right now is not to get out there and find the perfect set of circumstances, but instead to allow the unfolding of circumstances that will lead you right to a position that satisfies a myriad of intentions that you’ve come to through your life experience. In other words, you never know more clearly what it is you do want than when you’re living what you don’t want. So, not having enough money causes you to ask for more money. An unappreciative employer makes you ask for someone who appreciates your talent and willingness. A job that asks very little from you causes you to desire something that inspires more clarity and expansion through you. A job that requires a long mute in traffic gives birth to a desire for work that is closer to where you live, and so on."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"147 We’d like to convey to anyone looking for a change in their work environment – it’s already queued up for you in a sort of vibrational escrow. Your work is to align with what your past and current experiences had helped you to identify that you want. It may sound strange, but the fastest way to an improved work environment is to look for things in your current environment that make you feel good. Most people do exactly the opposite by pointing out the flaws where they stand in an effort to justify an improved environment. But since the LOA always gives you more of whatever you’re giving your attention to, if your attention is upon unwanted things, then more unwanted things are on the way as well. When you leave one situation because of the unwanted things that are present, you find the essence of the same unwanted things in your next environment as well. Think and speak of what you do want, make lists of things that are pleasant about where you are, think excitedly about the improvements that are on the way to you, deemphasize what you don’t like and emphasize what you do like. And then observe the Universe’s response to your improved vibration. 158. I’ll seek reasons to feel good. No matter how justified you are in your negative emotion, you’re still messing up your future. Most of you have given enough thought to what you want to keep you happily busy for 10 or 20 lifetimes. But your manifestations can’t get to you because your door’s closed. And the reason that your door is closed is because you’re so busy complaining about what-is or busy defending where you now stand. Look for reasons to feel good, and in your joy you open the door. And as you open your door, all of these things that you’ve said “I want” can then flow in. And it is our expectation that under those conditions you will live happily ever after, which after all is that which you have truly intended as you’ve come forth into this career of physical life experience. 159. Do I want to or do I have to? Most people feel a stark difference between the things that they want to do and the things that they believe they have to do. And most put anything that earns money in the category of the things that I have to do . That’s why the money often comes so hard, and that’s why there’s usually not enough of it."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"148 If you’re wise enough to follow the trail of good-feeling-thoughts, you will discover that that blissful path will lead you to all things that you desire. By deliberately looking for positive aspects along your way, you will come into vibrational alignment with who-you-really-are and with the things you really want. And once you do that, the Universe must deliver to you a viable means to achieve your desires. 160. What if my pleasure attracts money? Jerry: Esther and I had no intention of receiving income from our work with you, Abraham. We were really enjoying learning from you, and we were thrilled by the positive results we were personally receiving as we applied what we were learning. But it was never our intention for our work with you to become a business. It was an enlightening experience or just playing fun. And it still is fun, but now it has expanded dramatically into a worldwide enterprise. Abraham: So, are you saying that as your life experience expanded, your ideas and desires expanded also? Jerry: Yes. Abraham: And even though in the beginning you were not able to see or describe the details of how things would unfold, because it was fun and because you felt good this became a powerful avenue to fulfill desires and goals that had been in place long before you met us or began this work. Jerry: That’s right. My original intention in visiting with you was to learn a more effective way to help others to become more financially successful, and also I wanted to learn how to live our lives more in harmony with the natural Laws of the Universe, whatever they were. 161. I want my work to feel free The secret to all success is keeping yourself happy. Many of you have been taught that your own happiness is a selfish and inappropriate quest, and that your real objectives should revolve around commitment and responsibility and struggle and sacrifice. But we want you to understand that you can be committed and responsible and an uplifter and happy. In fact, unless you do find a way of connecting to your true happiness, all of those other quests are usually just empty hollow words not backed up by any true value. You only ever uplift from your position of connection and strength."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"149 People often say, “I don’t want to work”, meaning “I don’t want to go some place where I have to do unwanted things to earn money”. And when we ask why, they usually say, “Because I want to be free.” But it’s not freedom from action that you’re looking for, because action can be fun. And it’s not freedom from money that you want, because money and freedom are synonymous. You’re seeking freedom from negativity, from resistance, from disallowance of who-you-really-are. You’re seeking freedom from the disallowance of the abundance that is your birth right. You’re seeking freedom form lack. 162. What are its positive aspects? Whenever you feel negative emotion, that’s your emotional guidance system giving you an indication that you are in that moment looking at negative aspects of something. And in doing so, you’re depriving yourself of something wanted. If you will set an intention to look for positive aspects in whatever you’re giving your attention to, you will begin to immediately see the evidence of the lifting of patterns of resistance, as the Universe is then allowed by your shift in vibration to deliver your long wanted desires to you. People often move from job to job, profession to profession, employer to employer, only to find the next place no better than the last. And the reason for that is, they take themselves everywhere they go. When you go to a new place, and you continue to complain about what was wrong with your last position in order to explain why you came to the new position, the same vibrational mix of resistance goes with you and continues to prevent the things you want from coming to you. The best way to accomplish an improved work environment is to focus upon the best things about where you currently are, until you flood your own vibrational patterns of thought with appreciation. And in that changed vibration you can then allow the new and improved conditions and circumstances to come into your experience. Some worry that if they follow our encouragement to look for good things about where they are, that it will only hold them longer in an unwanted place. But the opposite is really true. In your state of appreciation you lift all self-imposed limitations (and all limitations are self-imposed) and you free yourself for the receiving of wonderful things. The vibration of true love, that feeling of being in love, that feeling that you have sometimes when you see someone and you feel like you’re moving through one another, the feeling that you have when you’re looking at the innocence of a child and feeling the beauty and the power of that child,"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"150 love and appreciation are identical vibrations. Appreciation is the vibration of alignment with who you are. It’s the absence of resistance. It’s the absence of doubt and fear. It’s the absence of self- denial or hatred toward others. Appreciation is the absence of everything that feels bad and the presence of everything that feels good. When you focus upon what you want, when you tell the story of how you want your life to be, you’ll come closer and closer to the vicinity of appreciation, and when you reach it, it will pull you toward all things that you consider to be good in a very powerful way. Conversely, let’s talk about the difference between gratitude and appreciation. Many people use those words interchangeably, but we do not feel the same vibrational essence in them at all. Because when you feel gratitude, often you’re looking at the struggle that you’ve overcome. In other words, you’re happy that you’re still not in the struggle, but there’s still some of that struggle vibration present. In other words, the difference between inspiration, which is being called to who you are, and motivation, which is trying to make yourself go somewhere, is a similar difference. Appreciation is that tuned in tapped in turned on feeling. Appreciation is vibrational alignment with who I have become. The state of appreciation is me being in sync with the whole of that which I am. Being in the state of appreciation is seeing whatever you’re looking at through the eyes of Source. And when you are in that state of appreciation, you could walk down a crowded street, with all kinds of things that a lot of other people would find reason to criticize or worry about, and you would not have access to them, because your vibration of appreciation is picking out for you things of a different vibrational nature. A state of appreciation is a state of godliness. A state of appreciation is being who-you-really-are. A state of appreciation is who you were the day you were born and who you will be in the moment you die. And it would be, if we were standing in your physical shoes, our quest in every moment. Your friend Joseph Campbell used the word bliss. And we think it’s equal. Follow your bliss. But sometimes you cannot get a whiff of bliss from where you are. So we say, if you’re in despair, follow your revenge. It’s downstream, it’s the right direction. If you’re in revenge, follow your hatred. It’s downstream, it’s in the right direction. If you’re in hatred, follow your anger. It’s downstream. If you’re in anger, follow your frustration. It’s downstream."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"151 If you’re in frustration, follow your hope. It’s downstream. If you’re in hope, now you’re in the vicinity of appreciation. Once you get into the vibration of hope, now begin making lists of things you feel good about. Fill your notebooks full of them. Make lists of positive aspects, make lists of things you love, go to the restaurant and look for your favorite things and never complain about anything. Look for things that you like the best. Even if there’s only one thing in all of that that you like, give it your undivided attention and use it as your excuse to be who you are. And as you use those things that shine bright and make you feel good as your excuse to give your attention and be who you are, you will tune to who you are, and the whole world will begin to transform before your eyes. It’s not your job to transform the world for others, but it is your job to transform it for you. A state of appreciation is pure connection to Source where there is no perception of lack. 163. My time at work is perceptual In the same way that many people are focused upon a shortage of money, there are also many who are focused upon a shortage of time. And often these two lackful subjects are intertwined to negatively impact one another. Usually the reason for this detrimental coupling of lackful subjects is the feeling that there is just not enough time to do what’s necessary to achieve success. The primary reason that people feel a shortage of time is because they’re trying to get too much leverage out of their action. If you are unaware of the power of alignment and are making little or no effort at finding your personal alignment, if you’re overwhelmed or angry or resentful or ornery, and from those emotional perspectives you’re then offering your action to try to accomplish things, you’re very likely experiencing a severe shortage of time. There simply is not enough action in the world to compensate for the misalignment of energy. But when you care about how you feel, and you tend to your vibrational balance first, then you experience what feels like a cooperative Universe that seems to open doors for you everywhere. The physical effort required of someone who is in alignment is a fraction of that required to someone who is not. The results experienced by someone who is in alignment are tremendous in comparison with the results experienced by someone who is not. If you’re feeling a shortage of time or money, your best effort would be to focus upon better-feeling thoughts, to make long lists of positive aspects, to look for reasons to feel good, and to do more things that make you feel good when you do them. Taking the time to feel better, to find positive aspects, to align with who-you- really-are, will net you tremendous results and help you balance your time much more effectively."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"152 Shortage of time is not your problem. Shortage of money is not your problem. Shortage of connection to the Energy that creates worlds is what is at the heart of all sensations of shortage that you’re experiencing. Those voids, or shortages, can be filled with only one thing – connection to Source and alignment with who-you-really-are. Your time is a perceptual thing. And even though the clock is ticking the same for everyone, your alignment affects your perception as well as the results that you allow. When you set time aside to envision your life as you want it to be, you access a power that is unavailable to you when you focus upon the problems of your life. As you observe the enormous differences in the effort that people apply and the results they achieve, you have to conclude that there is more to the equation of achieving than action alone. The difference is, that some receive the benefit of the leverage of alignment because of the thoughts they think, while others disallow the leverage because of the thoughts they think. Imagine yourself running 1 mile. And in this mile there are 2000 doors to move through. Imagine coming to each door and then having to personally open it before you can run through it. Now imagine running the mile, and as you approach each door, the door is opened for you, so you’re able to continue the pace slowing not at all upon approaching each door. When you’re in alignment with the Energy that creates worlds, you no longer have to stop and open the doors, your Energy alignment allows things to line up for you. And the action that you offer is the way you enjoy the benefit of the alignment that you’ve accomplished. 164. Should I try to work harder? You are a powerful creator who came into this leading-edge environment understanding that you create through the power of your thought by deliberately directing your focus toward things you want. You did not intend to rely on your action for that creation. It may take some time to adjust to the understanding that you’re creating through your thoughts, not through your action. But we cannot overstate the value of thinking and speaking of things as you would like them to be rather than as they are. Once you not only understand the power of your thought, but you deliberately direct this powerful tool in the direction of things that you desire, then you will discover that the action part of your life is the way that you enjoy what you’ve created through your thought."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"153 When you achieve vibrational alignment, which means your thoughts are pleasing you as you think them, and you feel an inspiration to act, you’ve accomplished the best of both worlds. Your action feels effortless when you’re tuned in to the vibrational frequency of Source, and then you feel an inspiration to offer action. Those outcomes are always pleasing. But action taken without tending to vibrational alignment first is hardworking inefficient action that over time wears you down. Most are so busy dealing with that which is immediate that they don’t have time to tend to that which is important. Many tell us that they are so busy making their money that they don’t have time to enjoy it. For when you rely on your action to create, often you’re too tired to enjoy your creation. Most people have a rather negative attitude about money. Simply because most people speak more often of what they cannot afford or the lack of the money they desire than they speak of the benefit of money. Also most people spend more time thinking about what is currently happening in their experience rather than what they would prefer to happen. And so, without meaning to, most people are thinking rather lackfully about money. So then when you couple an idea of something that you enjoy – your adventure, your music, your art – with something that you’ve felt strong lack about for a long time, like money, the balance of your thought tips toward the dominant feeling. As you begin spending more time visualizing what you desire and less time observing what-is, and as you begin to practice your more positive better-feeling story, in time your adventure will become the dominant vibration within you. And then as you couple your adventure with your means of earning, the two will blend perfectly and enhance each other. There is no better way to earn money than to do things you love to do. Money can flow into your experience through endless avenues. It’s not the choice of the craft or avenue that limits the money that flows, but the attitude toward the money. That’s why so many niche markets are continually opening with people becoming very wealthy from ideas that only recently were not viable markets at all. You are the creator of your own reality. And you are the creator of your own markets of enterprise and your own flow of money. You cannot accurately define some activities as hard and others as easy, because all things that are in harmony with what you’re wanting are easy and flowing, while all things that are not in harmony with what you’re wanting are harder and more resistant. Anytime what you’re doing feels like a struggle, you must understand that your contradictory thought is introducing resistance into the equation. Resistance is caused by thinking about what you do not want, and that’s what makes you tired."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"154 165. An example of my “old” story about my career Here’s an example of your “old” story about your career: “I’ve always worked hard in every job I’ve had, but I’ve never really been appreciated. Seems to me that employers always take advantage of me, getting everything from me that they can and giving as little in return as they can get away with. I’m tired of working so hard for so little. I’m going to start holding back too. No point in my knocking myself out when no one else notices. Many of the people around me at work know less than I know, work less than I work and make more money than I make. That’s just not right.” 166. An example of my “new” story about my career Here’s an example of a “new” story about your career: “I know that I will not always be right here in this place doing this same work. I like understanding that things are always evolving, and it’s fun to anticipate where I’m headed. While there are many things that could be better where I am, it’s not really a problem, because where I am is constantly changing to something better. I like knowing that as I look for the best things around me where I am, those things become more prevalent in my experience. It’s fun to know that things are always working out for me. I like looking for the evidence of that. And I see more evidence of it every day.” Remember, there is no right or wrong way to tell your improved story. It can be about your past or your present or your future experiences. The only criterion that is important is that you be conscious of your intent to tell a better-feeling improved version of your story. By telling many good-feeling short stories throughout your day you will change your point of attraction. 167. Time to tell a new story For many of you your old story has been about things that have gone wrong, things that aren’t the way you want them to be or think they should be, others who have let you down, others who have not been truthful with you. Your old story’s been about not enough money or not enough time or how things usually are. Your old story’s been about how things have been all of your life, or how things have been lately. It’s been about the injustices that you see in the world or others who don’t understand. Your story’s been about others who don’t make an effort, or others who are capable but don’t apply themselves. Your story’s been about dissatisfaction with your appearance, or worry"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"155 about your body’s health, or about people who take advantage of others, or about people who want to control you.

Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking meaningful questions regarding the application of the principles of the Law of Atraction to fnances, bodily conditions, and relationships—and then successfully applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations—Jerry and Esther made a deliberate decision to allow Abraham’s teachings to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of answers to how to live a better life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Esther and Jerry have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting a series of interactive Law of Attraction Workshops to those leaders who have gathered to participate in this progressive stream of thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, flms, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person, as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. Abraham—a group of obviously evolved Non-Physical teachers —speak their Broader Perspective through Esther. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear Connection with our loving, guiding Inner Being and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self. Featuring the Universal Law of Attraction, the Hickses have now published more than 800 Abraham-Hicks books, cassettes, CDs, and DVDs.
