On hi s arrival h e thre w away all his money and possessions and abandoned himself to a ne wly-discovered awareness th at his real na ture w as formless, immanent consciousness. His absorption in this a wareness was so intense that he was complet ely oblivious of his b ody and the world; insects chewed away portions of his le gs, his body wasted away because he was rarely conscious enough to ea t and his h air an d fingernails gre w to unmanageable lengths. After two or thr ee years in this st ate he began a slow ret urn to physical no rmalit y, a process th at was not finally complete d for se veral years. His awareness of himself as consciousness was u naffected by this physical tran sition an d it remaine d continuous and undimmed for the r est of his life. In Hin du parlance he had ‘realised t he Self’; that is to say, he had realised by direct ex perience that n othing existed a part fr om an indivisi ble an d universal co nsciousness whi ch was experienced in its unm anifest form as beingness or awareness a nd in its manife st form as the appearance of the u niverse. Normally this a wareness is only generated a fter a lo ng and arduous period of s piritual pr actice but in this c ase it happened spontaneously, without pri or effort o r desire. Venkataraman, the si xteen-year- old schoolboy, was al one in an upstairs ro om of his u ncle’s ho use in Mad urai (n ear th e southern tip of India) wh en he was s uddenly gripped by an intense fear of de ath. In the foll owing few minutes he went through a simulated d eath experience during which he became co nsciously aware f or the first time that hi s real nat ure w as imperish able a nd that it was unrelated to th e body, the mind o r the personality. Many people have reported similar unexpected experiences but they are almost invariably tempor ary. In Ve nkataraman’s ca se the experience was p erman ent an d irreversible. From that time on his consciousness of be ing an individual person ceased to e xist an d it never functioned in him again. Venkatarama n told no one about his experience and for si x weeks he kept up the appearance of being an ordinary schoolboy. However, he found it an increasingly difficult posture to maintain a nd at the end of this six week period he abandoned his family and went directly to the h oly mountain of Arunachala. The c hoice of Arunachala w as far from random. Throughout his brief life he had always associated the name o f Arunachala with Go d and it was a maj or revelatio n to him when he d iscovered t hat it was not some heavenly realm but a tangible e arthly entity. The mo untain itself had long been regarded by Hindus as a manif estatio n of Siva, a Hindu Go d, and in later years Venkataraman o ften said that it was the spiritual power of Arunachala whi ch had brought ab out his Self- realisati on. His lov e for th e mountain was so great that from the day he arrived in 1 896 until his de ath in 1950 he could never be persuaded to go more tha n two miles away from its ba se. After a fe w years of livin g on its slo pes his inner awareness be gan to manif est as an outer spiritual ra diance. This radiance attra cted a small circle of follo wers an d, alth ough he remain ed sile nt for most of the time, he embar ked upon a teaching career. One of his earlie st follower s, impres sed by the evident saintlin ess an d wisd om of the young man, decided to r ename him Bhagavan Sri Raman a Maharshi – Bh agavan mea ns Lord or God, Sri is an Indian h onorific title, Rama na is a co ntraction o f Venkataraman a nd Maharshi means ‘ great s eer’ in San skrit. The name f ound favour with his ot her followers a nd it soon became the title by which he became known to the worl d. At this stag e of his life Sri Ramana wa s speaking very little an d so hi s teachings wer e transmitted in an unusual fashion. Instead of gi ving out verbal instructions h e constantly emanated a sile nt force or power whi ch stilled t he minds of th ose w ho were attu ned to it and occasionally even gave them a direct experience of the st ate that he himself was p erpetually immersed in. In later years he became more willing t o give out verbal teachings, but even then, the silent te achings were always available to those who were able to mak e good use of them. Throughout his life Sri Raman a insiste d that this sile nt flow of po wer represented hi s teachings in their most dire ct and concentrated f orm. The import ance he attached to this is indicated by his frequent statements to th e effe ct that his ve rbal teachings wer e only given out to th ose w ho were un able to un derstand his sile nce. As the years pa ssed he became more and more famous. A community grew u p around him, thousands of visitors flocked to se e him and for the last twe nty years of his life he was widely regarded as India’s most popular a nd revered 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman holy man. Some of these thousands were attr acted by the peace they felt in his pr esence, others by the authoritati ve way in whi ch he guided spiritual seekers an d interpreted r eligio us teachings, an d some merely came to tell him their problems. Whatev er their re asons for comi ng almost ev eryone wh o came int o contact with him was impress ed by his simplicity and his h umble ness. He made himself av ailable to visitors tw enty-four hours a day by living and sleeping in a commun al hall whi ch wa s always accessible to ev eryone, an d his o nly private possessions were a l oin-cl oth, a water- pot and a walking-sti ck. Altho ugh he was wo rshipped by thousands as a livin g God, he refused to allow a nyone to treat him as a special person and he always refused to ac cept anything w hich c ould not be shared equally by everyone in his a shram. He shared in the c ommunal wor k and for many years he rose at 3 a.m. In order to pr epare fo od for the residents of the a shram. His sense of eq uality was le gendary. When visitor s came to se e him – it made no differ ence whether they were VIPs, peasants or an imals – they would all be treated with equal respect and consideratio n. His egalitaria n concern even extended to the local tree s; he discouraged his follow ers from picking flo wers or le aves off them an d he tried to en sure that wh enever fruit was taken from the ashram trees it was always done in such a w ay that the tre e only suffered a minimum amount of p ain. Throughout this pe riod (1925-50) the centre of a shram life was the small ha ll where Sri Raman a lived, sle pt and held court. He spent most of his d ay sittin g in one corner radiating his sile nt power and simultan eously fielding q uestions from the constant flow of v isitors wh o descended on him from every corner o f the globe. He rarely committed his ideas to pa per and so the verbal re plies gi ven out during this pe riod (by far th e most well-documented o f his life) represent the lar gest surviving s ource of h is teachings. These verbal teachings flowe d authoritatively from his dir ect kn owledge that consciousness w as the o nly existing reality. Consequently, all hi s explanations and instru ctions were geared to convincing his follo wers th at this was their true a nd natural state. Few of his f ollower s were capable of assimilating this trut h in its highest an d most undiluted form and so he often adapted his te achings to conform to the limited understanding of the p eople who cam e to him for advice. Because of this te ndency it is possible to disti nguish many different lev els of his te achings. At th e highest le vel that could be expressed in wor ds he would say that co nsciousness alone exists. If this was r eceived with skepticism he would say that awareness of this trut h is obscured by the self- limiting ideas of th e mind a nd that if these ideas were abandoned then the r eality of consciousness w ould be revealed. Most of hi s follow ers fo und this high-level approach a little too theoretic al -they were so immersed in the self-limiting ide as that Sri Ramana wa s encouraging them to drop that th ey felt th at the truth a bout consciousness wo uld on ly be revealed to th em if they underwent a lo ng period of spiritu al practice. To satisfy such people Sri Rama na prescribed an innovative method of self-atte ntion which he called self-e nquiry. He recommende d this tec hnique so ofte n and so v igorously that it was re garded by many people as the most distinctiv e motif in his te achings. Even then, many people wer e not s atisfied a nd they would continue to as k for ad vice about other methods or try to engage him in the oretic al philosophical disc ussions. With such people Sri Rama na wo uld temp orarily abandon his absolute sta ndpoint an d give appropriate ad vice on whatever level it was a sked. If he appeared on these occasions to accept and endorse many of the misco nceptions whi ch his v isitors ha d about themselv es it was only to draw their attention to s ome aspect of hi s teachings that h e felt wo uld he lp them to bett er understand his re al views. Inevitably, this poli cy of mo difying his teachings to meet th e needs of different pe ople led to many contradictio ns. He might, for example, tell one person that the individual self is no n-existent and then turn to another person and give a detailed d escriptio n of how the in dividual self functions, accumulates k arma and reincarnates. It is possible f or an observer to s ay that such opposing statements may both be true w hen seen from different sta ndpoints, bu t the former stateme nt clearly has more v alidity when it is vie wed from the absolute standpoint of Sri Rama na’s o wn ex perience. This sta ndpoint, summarise d by his statement th at consciousness al one exists, is ultimately the only yardstic k by which one can realistically assess the rel ative trut h of his wid ely differing a nd contradictory statements. To wh atever extent his o ther st atements de viate from this it ma y be assumed that to th at extent they are dil utions of the trut h. Bearing this i n mind I ha ve tried to arr ange the materi al in this book in such a way that his h ighest tea chings come 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman first and his least import ant or most diluted ones last. The o nly exception is a ch apter in whi ch he talks a bout his sile nt teachings. It ought to b e somew here near the beginning bu t I found it more expedient for a variety of reasons to fit it into a section about half-way through the book. I decided on this ov erall stru cture for two re asons. Firstly it gives the re ader a ch ance to g auge the relati ve importa nce of the various id eas presented, and secondly, and more import antly, it was Sri Raman a’s ow n preferre d metho d of teaching. When visitor s came to se e him he would alw ays try to convince them of the truth o f his higher te achings and only if they seemed unwillin g to ac cept them would he tone down his an swers and speak from a more r elative le vel. The te achings have been presented i n the form of a seri es of qu estions an d answers in whi ch Sri Ramana ou tlines his views on various su bjects. Each chapter is de voted to a different to pic an d each topic is pr efaced by a few introductory or explanatory remarks. The questions and answers whi ch form the bulk of each chapter ha ve been taken from many sources and assemble d in such a way that th ey give the appearance of being a c ontinuous conversation. I was forc ed to adopt this method because ther e are n o continuous le ngthy conversations available w hich cover the full spectrum of his views on any particular s ubject. For those who are inter ested, the sources of th e quotations whi ch mak e up the conversations a re all listed at th e end of the book. Sri Rama na usually answered questions in on e of the thre e vernacular languages of Sout h India: Tamil, Telugu and Malay- alam. No tape-recordings w ere ev er mad e and most of his answers were hurriedly written d own in En glish by his offi cial inter preters. Be cause some of the int erpret ers wer e not com pletely fluent in English s ome of the transcripti ons we re eith er ungrammatical or written in a kind of stilted En glish whi ch occasionally makes Sri Raman a sound like a p ompo us Vict orian. I ha ve deviated from the published texts by correcting a few of th e worst e xample s of this ki nd; in su ch cases the mea ning h as not been tamp ered with, only the mod e of expression. I have also contracted some of th e questions and answers in or der to eliminate material whi ch digressed too far fr om the subject under discussion. Thr oughout the b ook the questions are p refaced by a ‘ Q: ’ and Sri Ramana’ s answers by an ‘ A: ’. The o riginal texts from which these conversations a re taken are characteris ed by a luxuriant profusion of ca pital letters. I have eliminate d most of them, leaving on ly three terms, Guru, Self and Heart, consistently capitalised. Sri Raman a ofte n used these terms as synony ms for co nsciousness an d wherever this meaning is implie d I have retai ned the capitalisatio n to avoid confusion. A compl ete glo ssary of Sans krit words which are n ot tran slated in the text can be found at th e end of the b ook. The same gl ossary also includes brief de scriptions o f unfamiliar people, places an d scriptur al works which are menti oned in the text. Sri Raman a occasionally used Sans krit terms in un conventional ways. On the f ew occasions th at he does so in t his book I ha ve ignored the sta ndard di ctionary definitio ns and have instead given a definition w hich more accurately reflects th e intended meani ng. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman PART ONE - The Self That in w hich all these w orlds s eem to exist ste adily, that of which all these worlds are a possession, that from which all thes e worl ds rise, that for w hich all th ese exist, that by which all these worl ds come int o existence and that w hich is indeed all these – that alone is the existing r eality. Let us cherish that Self, which is th e reality, in the Heart. Cha pter 1 - The nature of t he Self The e ssence of Sri Rama na’s te achings is co nveyed in his fre quent ass ertions that th ere is a single immanent reality, directly experienced by everyone, which is simultan eously the source, th e substance and the real nature of ev erything that exists. He gave it num ber of diff erent names, ea ch one signifying a different as pect of the same in divisibl e reality. The followin g clas sificatio n incl udes all of his more common synonyms and explains th e implication s of the v arious terms used. 1 The Self This is the term that he used the most fre quently. He defined it by saying that the real Self or re al ‘I’ is, co ntrary to perceptible e xperience, not an experience of individuality but a non-personal, all-in clusive aw areness. It is not to be confused with the in dividual s elf which he said was e ssentially non-existent, being a fa brication o f the mind whi ch obscures th e true e xperience of the re al Self. He maintai ned that th e real Self is alw ays present an d always experienced but he emph asized that one is only consciously aware of it as it really is when the s elf- limiting tendencies of the mind h ave ceased. Permane nt and continuous Self- a wareness is known as Self-r ealisati on. 2 Sat-chit-ananda This is a Sans krit term which tra nslates a s being-consciousness-b liss. Sri Raman a taught th at the Self is pure being, a subjective aw areness of ‘I am’ whi ch is compl etely devoid of the feeling ‘I am this’ or ‘I am th at’. There ar e no subjects or objects in th e Self, there is only an awareness of be ing. Because this awareness is co nscious it is also known as co nsciousness. The d irect ex perience of this consciousness is, according to Sri Rama na, a state o f unbroken happiness and so the term ananda or bliss is als o used to de scribe it. These thr ee aspects, being, co nsciousness and bliss, ar e experienced as a unitary whole an d not as s eparate attrib utes o f the Self. They are inseparable in the s ame way that wet ness, transparency and liquidity are in separable pr operties of w ater. 3 God Sri Rama na maintain ed that the universe is su stained by the power of the Self. Since t heists no rmally attribut e this power to Go d he often used the w ord G od as a synony m for the Self. He also used the words Brahman, th e supreme bei ng of Hinduism, and Siva, a Hin du name for Go d, in the same w ay. Sri Raman a’s God is not a personal God, he is the formless be ing which sust ains th e universe. He is not the creator of th e universe, the universe is merely a manifestati on of hi s inherent p ower; he is ins eparable from it, but he is not affected by its appearance or its disappearance. 4 The He art Sri Rama na fre quently used the Sans krit word hridayam when he was tal king a bout the Self. It is usually translated a s ‘the H eart’ bu t a more literal translation w ould be ‘this is th e centre’. In using this pa rticular term he was not impl ying that th ere wa s a particular lo cation or ce ntre for the Self, he was merely indicatin g that th e Self was the s ource from which all ap pearances manifest ed. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman 5 Jnana The e xperience of the Self is sometimes called jnana or knowledge. This term should not be taken to mean t hat ther e is a person who has knowledge of the Self, because in th e state of Self-a wareness there is no localise d knower and there is nothing that is separate from the Self th at can be known. True k nowledge, or jnana, is not an object of experience, no r is it an u nderstanding o f a state whi ch is diff erent and apart from the subject knower; it is a dire ct and knowing aw areness of the o ne reality in whi ch subjects an d objects have ceased to e xist. One who is est ablish ed in this state is kn own as a jnani. 6 Turiy a and turyatita Hindu ph ilosophy postulates thr ee alter nating levels of rel ative co nsciousness – w aking, dre am and deep sleep. Sri Raman a state d that th e Self wa s the underlying re ality which supported th e appearance of the ot her thr ee temp orary states. Because of this h e sometimes calle d the Self turiya avastha or th e fourth state. He als o occasionally used the wor d turiyatita, meaning ‘transcending the fourth’, to indicate that th ere ar e not r eally four states b ut only one real transcendental state, 7 Other terms Three other terms for the Self are worth no ting. Sri Ramana oft en emp hasized that the Self was o ne’s real an d natural state o f being, an d for this r eason, he occasionally employed the terms sahaja sthiti, meaning the natural state, and swarupa, meaning real f orm or real nature. He also used the word ‘sile nce’ to indi cate th at the Self was a sile nt thought-fre e state of u ndisturbed peace and total stillness. Q: What is reality? A: Reality must be always real. It is not with forms and names. Th at which underlies these is the reality. It underlies limitations, being itself limitless. It is not b ound. It un derlies un realities, itself bei ng real. Reality is that w hich is. It is as it is. It trans cends speech. It is beyond th e expressions ‘exist ence, no n-existence’, etc. The reality which is the mere c onsciousness th at remains wh en ignorance is de stroyed along with kn owledge of objects, al one is the Self [atma] . In that Brahma-sw arupa [real form of Bra hman], which is ab undant Self- awareness, there is not the least ig norance. The reality which shi nes fully, without misery and witho ut a body, not only when the worl d is known but also when the world is no t known, is your real form [nija-swar upa]. The radiance of consciousness-bliss, in th e form of one awareness shi ning equally within an d with out, is the supreme and blissf ul primal reality. Its form is silen ce and it is declared by jnanis to be the final an d unobstructable state o f true knowledge [jn ana]. Know th at jnana alone is no n-attachment; jnana alone is pu rity; jnana is th e attainment of G od; jn ana which is devoid of for getfulness of Self alone is immortalit y; jnana alone is ev erything. Q: What is this a wareness an d how can one obtain and cultivate it? A: You are awareness. Awareness is another nam e for you. Since you are awareness there is no need to attain o r cultivate it. All that you have to do is to give up being aware of other thin gs, that is of th e not-Self. If one gives up being aw are of them then pure awareness alo ne remains, and that is the Self. Q: If the Self is itself aware, why am I not aware o f it even now? A: There is no duality. Your present knowledge is due to the ego and is on ly relative. Relati ve knowledge requires a subject and an object, wh ereas the awareness of th e Self is ab solute an d requires no object. Remembra nce al so is similarl y relative, re quirin g an object to be remembere d and a subject to remember. When there 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman is no duality, who is to remember w hom? The Self is ev er-present. Each one wants to k now the Self. What ki nd of help does one require to kn ow oneself? People w ant to se e the Self as s omethin g new. But it is eternal and remains th e same all alo ng. Th ey desire to s ee it as a bla zing light etc. Ho w can it be so? It is no t light, not darkness. It is only as it is. It cannot be defined. The best definitio n is ‘I am that I am’. The srutis [scripture s] speak of the Self as being the size of one’s thumb, the tip of the h air, an electric s park, vast, su btler tha n the s ubtlest, etc. Th ey have no foundation in fact. It is only being, but d ifferent from the real an d the unreal; it is knowledge, bu t different from knowledge and ignorance. How ca n it be defined at all ? It is simpl y being. Q: When a man r ealises t he Self, what will he see? A: There is no seeing. Seeing is on ly being. The state o f Self-r ealisati on, as we c all it, is not attai ning somethin g new or reaching some goal which is far away, but simply being that whi ch you always are and which you alw ays have been. All that is ne eded is th at you giv e up your realis ation o f the not-true a s true. All of us ar e regarding as real that which is not r eal. We have only to give up this p ractice on our part. Then we shall realise th e Self as the Self; in other words, ‘Be the Self. At one stage you will laugh at yourself for trying to dis cover the Self whi ch is so s elf-evi dent. So, what can we say to this qu estion? That sta ge tra nscends the seer and the seen. Ther e is no seer th ere to se e anything. The s eer wh o is se eing all this n ow ceases to exist a nd the Self alone remains. Q: How to kn ow this by direct ex perience? A: If we talk of k nowing the Self, there must be two selves, on e a kn owing self, another th e self whi ch is kn own, and the process o f knowing. The stat e we call re alisatio n is simply being oneself, not knowing anything o r becoming anything. If on e has realis ed, on e is that whi ch alone is and which alone has always been. One cannot describe th at state. On e can only be that. Of co urse, we loosely talk o f Self-r ealisati on, for wa nt of a better term. How to ‘realise’ o r make r eal that whi ch alone is real? Q: You sometimes say the Self is silence. Why is this ? A: For those who live in Self as the b eauty devoid of thought, there is no thing whi ch should be thought of. That which should be adhered to is only the experience of silence, be cause in t hat su preme state n othing exists to be attained other than oneself. Q: What is mou na [silenc e]? A: That state w hich transcends speech and thought is mou na. Th at which is, is moun a. How ca n mou na be explained in wor ds? Sages say that the st ate in whi ch the thought ‘I’ [the eg o] does not rise ev en in the least, alone is Self [swaru pa] which is silence [mouna]. That sile nt Self al one is Go d; Self alone is the jiva [indivi dual soul]. Self alone is this an cient world. All other knowledges are o nly petty and trivi al knowledges; the experience of sile nce alone is the r eal an d perfect knowledge. Kn ow that th e many objective diff erences are not real bu t are mere s uperimposition s on Self, which is the form of true k nowledge. Q: As th e bodies a nd the sel ves animating th em are everywhere act ually observed to be innumera ble ho w can it be said that the Self is only one? A: If the ide a ‘I am th e body’ is accepted, the sel ves ar e multiple. The state in w hich this idea vanishes is the Self since in th at state ther e are n o other ob jects. It is for this re ason that th e Self is re garded as one only. Since t he body itself does not e xist in th e natural outl ook of the r eal Self, but only in the e xtroverted outlook of th e mind whi ch is del uded by the power of illusio n, to call Self, the space of consciousness, dehi [the po ssessor of t he body] is wrong. The w orld do es not exist without the body, the body never exists with out the mind, th e mind never exists witho ut consciousness an d consciousness ne ver exists with out th e reality. 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman For the wis e one who has known Self by diving withi n himself, there is not hing other tha n Self to be known. Wh y? Because sin ce the ego which identifies th e form of a body as ‘I’ has perished, he [the wis e one] is the formless existence-consciousness. The jnani [one w ho has realised the Self] knows he is the Self and that no thing, neit her his b ody nor anything els e, exists but the Self. To su ch a one what difference could the presence or absence of a body make? It is fals e to sp eak of realisation. What is there to r ealise ? The real is as it is always. We are not creating anything ne w or achieving somethi ng whi ch we did not have before. The illustrati on given in books is this. We dig a well an d create a huge pit. The space in the pit or w ell has not been created by us. We have just remov ed the earth which was filling the space there. The s pace was t here th en and is also ther e now. Similarly we have simply to thr ow ou t all the age- long samsk aras [innat e tendencies] which are insi de us. When all of t hem have been given up, t he Self will shi ne alone. Q: But h ow to d o this an d attain liber ation? A: Liberati on is ou r very nature. We are that. The very fact that we wis h for liber ation shows that fre edom from all bondage is ou r real nat ure. It is not to be freshly acquired. All that is necessary is to g et rid of th e false no tion that we are bound. When we achieve that, there will be no desire or th ought of any sort. So long as one desires lib eratio n, so long, you may take it, one is in bo ndage. Q: For on e who has realized his Self, it is said that h e will not have the thr ee state s of wakefulness, dream an d deep sleep. Is that a fa ct? A: What mak es you say that th ey do not h ave the three st ates? In saying ‘I had a dream; I was in de ep sleep; I am awake’, you must admit that you were th ere in all th e three st ates. That mak es it clear that you were th ere all th e time. If you remain as you are n ow, you are in the w akeful state; this b ecomes hid den in the d ream state; an d the dream state di sappears wh en you are in d eep slee p. You wer e there then, you are there no w, and you are there at all times. The thr ee state s come an d go, but you are always there. It is like a cinema. The screen is alw ays there bu t several types of pictures ap pear on the screen and then disappear. Not hing sticks t o the scr een, it remains a s creen. Similarl y, you remain your own Self in all the thr ee stat es. If you know that, th e three st ates will not trouble you, just as the pictures whi ch appear on the screen do not stick to it. On the s creen, you sometimes see a huge ocean with endless waves; that di sappears. Another time, you see fire s preading all around; that to o disappears. Th e screen is there on both occasions. Did th e screen get wet with th e water o r did it get burned by the fire? Nothing affected th e screen. In the same way, the thi ngs th at happen during the w akeful, dream and sleep states do not affect you at all; you remain your own Self. Q: Does that mean that, alth ough people have all three states, wa kefulness, dream and deep sleep, these do not affect them? A: Yes, that is it. All thes e states c ome an d go. The Self is not bothered; it has only one state. Q: Does that mean that s uch a person will be in this worl d merely as a witn ess? A: That is so; for this v ery thing, Vidyaranya, in the tenth c hapter of t he Pan chadasi, gives as example the lig ht that is kept on the sta ge of a theatre. When a drama is being played, the light is there, which illuminat es, without any distinction, all th e actors, whether they be kings or ser vants or da ncers, an d also all the audience. That light will be there before the drama begins, du ring th e performan ce and also after th e performan ce is ov er. Simi larly, the light within, th at is, the Self, giv es light to th e ego, the int ellect, the memor y and the mind without itself b eing subject to processes o f growth an d decay. Altho ugh during deep sleep and other states ther e is no feeling of the e go, th at Self remains attri buteless, and continues to s hine o f itself. Actually, the idea of the Self being the witness is only in the mind; it is not t he absolute truth o f the Self. Witnessin g is relative to objects witn essed. Both th e witnes s and his ob ject are mental cr eations. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Q: How are th e thre e states o f consciousness inferior i n degree of reality to the fourth [turi ya]? What is the actual relation between these thr ee state s and the fourth? A: There is only one state, that of c onsciousness o r awareness or e xistence. The thre e states o f waking, dr eam and sleep cannot be real. They simpl y come an d go. The re al will alw ays exist. The ‘I’ or ex istence th at alone persists in all the thr ee stat es is real. The other thr ee are not real and so it is not possible to say they have such and such a de gree of reality. We may roughly put it like this. Existe nce or consciousness is the only reality. Consciousness pl us wa king, we call wa king. Consciousness plus sle ep, we c all sleep. Consciousness pl us dream, we call dream. Consciousness is th e screen on which all the p ictures come a nd go. The s creen is real, th e pictures are mere s hadows on it. Because by long habit w e have been regarding these three states as r eal, we call th e state of mere a wareness or consciousness the f ourth. There is however no fourth state, bu t only one state. There is no difference between dream and the waking state ex cept that the d ream is short and the wa king long. Both are the res ult of the mind. Be cause the waking stat e is long, we imagi ne that it is our real state. But, as a matter of fa ct, our real stat e is turiya or the fourth state w hich is alw ays as it is and knows nothing of the t hree st ates of wa king, dream or sleep. Because we call th ese thr ee avasthas [states] we ca ll the fourth state al so turiya avastha. But is it not an avastha, but the r eal an d natural stat e of the Self. When this is realised, we kn ow it is not a turiya or fourth state, for a fourth stat e is only relative, bu t turiyatita, the trans cendent state. Q: But w hy should these three state s come an d go on the real state or th e screen of the Self? A: Who p uts this qu estion? Does the Self say these states com e and go? It is the seer who says these come an d go. The seer an d the seen together constitute t he mind. See if there is su ch a thing a s the mind. The n, the mind merg es in the Self, an d ther e is neither the s eer no r the s een. So th e real an swer to your qu estion is, ‘They neither come no r go.’ The Self al one remains as it ever is. Th e three states ow e their existence to non-enquiry and enquiry puts an end to them. However muc h one may explain, the fact will no t become cle ar till on e attai ns Self-r ealisati on and wonders ho w one was blind to the self-e vident a nd only existence so lo ng. Q: What is the differ ence between the mind and the Self? A: There is no difference. Th e mind turned inw ards is th e Self; tur ned outwards, it becomes th e ego and all the wo rld. Cotton made int o various cl othes we ca ll by various names. Gol d made int o various ornaments, we call by various names. But all th e clothes ar e cotton and all th e ornaments go ld. The o ne is re al, the many are mere names a nd forms. But th e mind d oes not e xist ap art from the Self, that is, it has no independent existence. The Self exists wit hout the mind, never the mind without the Self. Q: Brahman is sai d to be sat-chit-ananda. What do es that mean? A: Yes. That is so. Th at which is, is on ly sat. That is call ed Bra hman. The lu stre of sat is ch it and its nature is ananda. These are not diff erent from sat. All the thr ee together are known as sat- chit-ananda. Q: As th e Self is existence [sat] and consciousness [chit] what is the reason for describing it as diff erent from the existent an d the non-existent, the sentient an d the inse ntient? A: Although the Self is real, as it comprise s everything, it does not g ive room for questions involving du ality about its reality or unreality. Therefore it is sai d to be different from the real a nd the unreal. Similarl y, even though it is consciousness, since ther e is nothing f or it to kn ow or to make itself kn own to, it is sai d to be d ifferent from the sentient an d the insentient. Sat-chit-a nanda is said to in dicate that th e supreme is not asat [differ ent from being], not achit [differe nt from consciousness] and not an anananda [different from happiness]. Because we are in th e phenomenal world we s peak of the Self as s at-chit-a nanda. Q: In what se nse is happiness or blis s [ananda] our real na ture? 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman A: Perfect bliss is Bra hman. Perfect pe ace is of th e Self. That al one exists a nd is consciousness. That w hich is ca lled h appiness is only the nature of Self; Self is not o ther than perfect ha ppiness. That w hich is ca lled h appiness alone exists. Kn owing that fa ct and abiding in the stat e of Self, enjoy bliss eter nally. If a man thin ks that hi s happiness is du e to external ca uses and his po ssessions, it is reasonable to co nclude that his happiness must in crease with th e incr ease of possessions and diminish in p roportio n to their diminuti on. Ther efore if he is devoid of possessions, his h appiness sh ould be nil. What is the real ex perience of man ? Does it conform to this v iew? In deep sleep man is de void of p ossessions, including his o wn body. Instead of being un happy he is quite happy. Everyone de sires to sle ep soundly. The conclusion is that ha ppiness is inherent in man a nd is no t due to ex ternal causes. One must realise the Self in order to open the stor e of un alloyed ha ppiness. Q: Sri Bhagavan speaks of the He art as the s eat of c onsciousness a nd as identical with th e Self. What does the He art ex actly signify? A: Call it by any name, Go d, Self, th e Heart or th e seat of consciousness, it is all the same. The p oint to b e grasped is this, that He art means th e very core of o ne’s being, the c entre, without which there is no thing wh atever. The H eart is not physical, it is spiritual. Hridayam equals hrit plus ayam; it means ‘this is th e centre’. It is that fr om which thoughts arise, on whi ch they subsist an d where they are resolved. The t houghts are the content of the mind an d they shape the universe. The H eart is the centre o f all. That from which beings come i nto exi stence is sai d to be Brahman in th e Upanishads. That is the He art. Brahman is th e Heart. Q: How to realis e the He art? A: There is no one who even for a moment fails to ex perience the Self. For no one admits that he ever stands apart from the Self. He is the Self. The Self is the Heart. The H eart is the c entre from which everything sp rings. Because you see the worl d, the body and so on , it is sai d that there is a centre for th ese, whi ch is ca lled th e Heart. When you are in th e Heart, the H eart is kn own to be n either the centre n or the circumfer ence. There is nothing els e apart from it. The c onsciousness w hich is the real e xistence and which does not go out to kn ow those thin gs whi ch are other than Self, alone is the He art. Since the trut h of Self is known on ly to that consciousness, which is devoid of activity, that consciousness whi ch alw ays remains atte nding to Self alone is the shi ning of cle ar knowledge. 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Cha pter 2 - Self-awareness and Self-i gnorance Sri Rama na occasionally indicated that there were thr ee cla sses o f spiritual as pirants. The most advanced realise the Self as soon as they are told about its real na ture. Those in the second class ne ed to reflect on it for some time before Self-aw areness be comes firmly establish ed. Th ose in th e third ca tegory are less f ortunate sin ce they usually need many years of intensive spiritual practice to ac hieve the goal of Self-realis ation. Sri Rama na sometimes us ed a metap hor of c ombu stion to d escribe th e thre e levels: gunpowder ignit es with a sin gle sp ark, ch arcoal n eeds the application o f heat for a short time, and wet coal needs to dry out and heat up over a lo ng period of time before it will begin to burn. For the b enefit of those in th e top two c ategories Sri Raman a taught that th e Self alone exists a nd that it can be directly and consciously experienced merely by ceasing to pay attention to the wr ong ideas we have about ourselves. These wro ng ideas he collectively called t he ‘not-Self’ since they are an imaginary accretio n of wr ong notions and misperc eptions whi ch eff ectively veil the tru e experience of the r eal Self. The principal misper ception is th e idea that the Self is limited to the body and the mind. As so on as one ceases to imagi ne that one is an individual pe rson, inhabitin g a pa rticular body, the whole superstr ucture of wro ng ideas collapses and is replaced by a conscious and permane nt awareness of th e real Self. At this lev el of the te aching t here is no question of eff ort or practice. All that is re quired is an understanding that the Self is not a go al to be attain ed, it is merely the aw areness th at prevails wh en all th e limiting ideas ab out the not-Self have been discarded. Q: How can I attain Self-re alisatio n? A: Realisation is no thing to be gained afresh; it is alre ady there. All that is ne cessary is to get rid of th e thought ‘I have not realised’’. Stillness or pe ace is realiz ation. There is no mome nt when the Self is not. So long as th ere is do ubt or the feeling o f non-realization, the att empt should be made to rid o neself of th ese th oughts. They are due to the id entific ation o f the Self with the not-Self. When t he not-Self disappears, the Self alo ne remai ns. To make r oom, it is enough that objects be remove d. Room is not brought in fr om elsewhere. Q: Since realization is no t possible wit hout vasana-kshaya [destru ction o f mental tendencies], how am I to realize t hat state in w hich the tendencies are e ffectively destroyed? A: You are in th at state no w. Q: Does it mean that by holding on to the Self, the vasanas [mental tendencies] should be destroyed as and when they emerg e? A: They will th emselves b e destroyed if you remain as you are. Q: How shall I reach the Self? A: There is no reaching t he Self. If Self were to b e reached, it would mean th at the Self is not here and now and that it is yet to be obtained. What is got afresh will also be lost. So it will be impermane nt. What is not permanent is not worth striving for. So I say the Self is not r eached. You are the Self, you are already that. The fact is, you are ignorant of your blissful stat e. Ignorance supervenes and draws a veil o ver the pure Self which is bliss. Attempts are dir ected only to remo ve this ve il of ignorance which is merely wrong kn owledge. Th e wrong knowledge is the fals e identificatio n of th e Self with th e body and the mind. This fals e identificatio n must go , and then the Self al one remains. Therefore realiz ation is for everyone; realizati on mak es no difference between the aspirants. This ve ry doubt, whether you can realize, and the notion ‘I-h ave-not-realized’ are themselve s the obstacles. Be fre e 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman from these obstacles also. Q: How lon g does it take to reach mukti [liberation] ? A: Mukti is not to be gained in the f uture. It is there f or ever, here and now. Q: I agree, bu t I do not experience it. A: The experience is he re and now. On e cannot deny one’s own Self. Q: That means existence and not happiness. A: Existence is th e same as happiness and happiness is the same as b eing. The wo rd mukti is so provoking. Wh y should one seek it? One believes that ther e is bondage and therefore seeks liber ation. But the fact is th at there is no bondage but only liberati on. Wh y call it by a nam e and seek it? Q: True – but we are i gnorant. A: Only remove ig norance. That is all ther e is to be done. All questions relating to mukti are inadmissible. Mukti mea ns release from bondage which implies the present existence of b ondage. Th ere is no bondage and ther efore no mukti either. Q: Of wh at nature is the r ealization of w esterners w ho rel ate that th ey have had flashes of c osmic co nsciousness? A: It came as a flas h and disappeared as such. That whi ch has a b eginning must also end. Only when the ever-present consciousness is realized will it be perma nent. Consciousness is indeed al ways with us. Everyone k nows ‘I am’. No one can deny his ow n being. The man in de ep sleep is not aware; while a wake he seems to be aware. But it is the s ame person. There is no change in the one who slept and the one who is no w awake. In deep sleep he was not aware of his body and so there wa s no body-consciousness. In t he wa keful state he is aware of his bo dy and so th ere is bo dy- consciousness. Therefore the diff erence lies in th e emerg ence of b ody-consciousness a nd not in any change in the r eal consciousness. The b ody and body-consciousness a rise to gether and sink together. All this amou nts to saying that ther e are n o limitations in deep sleep, wh ereas ther e are limitations in th e waking state. These limitations ar e the b ondage. Th e feeling ‘Th e body is I’ is the err or. This false sense of ‘I’ must g o. The real ‘I’ is always there. It is here and now. It never appears anew an d disappears ag ain. Th at which is must als o persist for ever. That whi ch appears anew will als o be lost. Comp are de ep sleep and waking. The body appears in on e state b ut not in the other. Ther efore the body will be lost. The c onsciousness w as pre-exist ent an d will survive th e body. There is no one who does not s ay ‘I am’. The wrong kn owledge of ‘I am the body’ is the cause of all the mischi ef. This wro ng knowledge must go . That is realization. Re alizatio n is not acquisition o f anything ne w nor is it a new faculty. It is only removal of all cam ouflage. The u ltimate truth is so simple. It is nothing more than being in th e pristine state. This is all that need be said. Q: Is one nearer to pu re consciousness in de ep sleep than in the w aking state ? A: The sle ep, dr eam and waking stat es are mere p henomena appearing on the Self whi ch is itself stationary. It is also a state of simple awareness. Can a nyone remain a way from the Self at any moment ? This question can arise on ly if that w ere po ssible. Q: Is it not often sai d that on e is ne arer pure consciousness in deep sleep than in the wa king state? A: The question may as well be ‘Am I nearer to myself in my sleep than in my waking state ?’ The Self is pure consciousness. No one can ever be away from the Self. The q uestion is po ssible only if there is du ality. But th ere is no duality in the state of p ure consciousness. The same person sleeps, dreams an d wakes up.

The a bsence of su ch experience makes on e say that the sle ep stat e is dull. Before we proceed further let us make this p oint clear. Do you not admit that you exist in your sleep? Q: Yes, I do. A: You are the same per son that is now awake. Is it not so? Q: Yes. A: So there is a c ontinuity in the sle ep and the waking states. What is that co ntinuity? It is on ly the state of pu re being. There is a differ ence in th e two states. What is that difference? The incidents, namely , the body, the w orld an d objects appear in th e waking stat e but they disappear in slee p. Q: But I am not aware in my sleep. A: True, ther e is no awareness of th e body or of the w orld. But you must exist in your sleep in order to say now ‘I was not aware in my sleep’. Who says so now? It is the w akeful pe rson. The sle eper cannot say so. That is to say, the individual wh o is now identifying the Self with the body says that s uch awareness di d not exist in slee p. Because you identify yourself with th e body, you see the world a round you an d say that th e waking state is filled with beautiful and interesting thi ngs. Th e sleep state ap pears dull because you were not ther e as an individual an d ther efore these thin gs wer e not. But w hat is the fact? There is the continuity of being in all the thr ee stat es, but no continuity of the individual and the objects. Q: Yes. A: That whi ch is co ntinuous is also enduring, that is permanent. That which is discontinuous is transitory. Q: Yes. A: Therefore the state o f being is pe rmane nt and the body and the world a re not. They are fleeti ng ph enomena passing on the screen of be ing-consciousness whi ch is eter nal an d statio nary. Q: Relatively speaking, is not the sleep state ne arer to pure consciousness tha n the w aking stat e? A: Yes, in this se nse: when passing from sleep to w aking the ‘I’-t hought [indivi dual self] must start an d the mind must come into pl ay. Then thoughts aris e and the f unctions o f the body come int o operation. All these together mak e us say that we are a wake. The a bsence of all this ev olution is th e characteristic of sle ep and therefore it is nearer to pure consciousness th an the waking stat e. But on e should not therefore desire t o be always in sleep. In the first place it is impossi ble, for it will ne cessarily alternate with t he other state s. Secondly it cannot be the state of b liss in whic h the j nani is, for his stat e is perman ent and not alternating. Moreover, the sle ep state is not recognized to b e one of awareness by people, but the s age is always aware. Th us the sl eep st ate differ s from the state in whi ch the sage is esta blished. Still more, the slee p state is fre e from thoughts a nd their impressio n on the individual. It cannot be alter ed by one’s will because effort is impossi ble in th at condition. Although nearer to pu re consciousness, it is not fit for e fforts to realize th e Self. Q: Is not the realizatio n of on e’s absolute b eing, that is, Brahma-jn ana, somethin g quite unattainable f or a layman like me? A: Brahma-j nana is not a knowledge to b e acquired, so that ac quiring it one may obtain ha ppiness. It is on e’s ignorant outlook that on e should gi ve up. The Self you se ek to k now is truly yourself. Your su pposed ignorance causes you needless gri ef like that o f the ten foolish men who grieved at t he loss o f the tenth man wh o was n ever lost.

One aft er the other ea ch of the te n counted only 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman nine, missin g himself. ‘We are only nine’, they all agreed, ‘but wh o is the missing o ne?’ they asked themselv es. Every effort they made to dis cover th e ‘missin g’ individual failed. ‘Whoe ver he is that is drowned’, said th e most sentimental of th e ten fools, ‘we have lost him.’ So saying he burst into tear s, and the others foll owed suit. Seeing them we eping on the riv er bank, a sy mpath etic wayfarer enquired about th e cause. Th ey related w hat ha d happened and said th at even after counting themsel ves several times they could find no more tha n nine. On hearing the story, but seeing all the te n before him, the wayfarer gu essed what ha d happened. In order to make th em know for themsel ves th ey were re ally ten, th at all of t hem had survived the crossing, he told them, ‘Let ea ch of you count for himself but o ne after the o ther serially , one, two, thre e and so o n, while I sh all give you ea ch a blow so that all of you may be sure of having been included in the count, and included only once. Th e tenth missin g man will th en be found.’ Hearing this they rejoiced at th e prospect of fin ding their ‘lost’ comra de and accepted the method suggested by the wayfarer. While the kind wayfarer gave a blow to ea ch of the te n in turn, he that go t the bl ow co unted himself aloud. ‘Ten,’ said the last man a s he g ot the last blow in hi s turn. Bewild ered they looked at on e another, ‘We are ten,’ they said with one voice and thanked the wayfarer for having remove d their g rief. That is th e parable. From where was the tenth man b rought in? Was he ever lost ? By knowing that h e had been there all the w hile, did they learn anything n ew? The cause of th eir grief was n ot the r eal loss o f anyone, it was their ow n ignorance, or rather, their mere supposition th at one of them was lo st. Such is the case with you. Truly there is no cause for you to be miserabl e and unhappy. You yourself impos e limitations on your true nature of infinite b eing, and then weep that you are but a finite cr eature. Then you tak e up this or that spiritual pr actice to tran scend the non-existent limitations. But if your spiritu al practice itself as sumes the existence of t he limitations, how can it hel p you to tra nscend them? Hence I say know that you are really the infinit e pure being, the Self. Yo u are alw ays that Self and nothing but that Self. Therefore, you can never be really ignorant of th e Self. Your ignorance is merely an imagi nary ignorance, lik e the ignorance of the ten fools a bout the lo st tenth man. It is this ig norance that caused them grief. Know th en that true knowledge does not cre ate a n ew be ing for you, it only removes your ignorant ignorance. Bliss is not added to your nat ure, it is merely revealed as your true natural stat e, eternal and imperis hable. The o nly way to be rid of your grief is to kn ow and be the Self. Ho w can this be unattainable? Q: However oft en Bh agavan teaches us, we are not able to understand. A: People say that they are not able to kn ow the Self that is all pervading. What can I do? Even the smallest chil d says, ‘I exist; I do; this is mine.’ So, ev eryone un derstands th at the thi ng ‘I’ is always existent. It is only when that ‘I’ is there that ther e is the feeling th at you ar e the body, he is Ve nkanna, this is Ramanna and so on. To kn ow that the one that is alw ays visible is on e’s own Self, is it ne cessary to search with a candle? To say that we d o not know the atma swarupa [the re al nature of th e Self] which is no t differ ent bu t which is in one’s own Self is like saying, ‘I do not know myself.’ Q: But h ow is on e to re ach this state ? A: There is no goal to be reached. Th ere is nothing to be attained. You are the Self. Yo u exist always. Nothing more can be predicated o f the Self than that it exists. Seein g God or the Self is only being the Self or yourself. Seeing is being. Yo u, being the Self, want to kn ow how to att ain the Self. It is somethin g like a man be ing at Ramana sramam asking how many ways there ar e to reach Rama nasramam and which is the b est way for him. All that is re quired of you is to gi ve up the thought that you ar e this body and to give up all thoughts of the e xternal thin gs or th e not-Self. Q: What is the ego-self? How is it related to the r eal Self? A: The ego-Self ap pears and disappears an d is tra nsitory, whereas the real Self is perman ent. Though you are actually the true Self you wrongly identify the real Self with the ego-self. 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Q: How does the mistak e come a bout?

Ignorance pertains to t he ego. Wh y do you think o f the ego and also su ffer? What is ignorance again? It is that whi ch is nonexistent. However th e worldly life requires th e hypot hesis o f avidya. Avidya is only our ignorance and nothing more. It is ignorance or f orgetf ulness of th e Self. Ca n there be darkness before the sun? Similarly , can there be ignorance before th e self-ev ident and self- lumino us Self? If you know the Self there will be no darkness, no ignorance and no misery.

Q: How has the unreal come? Can the unreal spri ng from the re al? A: See if it has sprung. There is no such thi ng as th e unreal, from another standpoint. The Self alone exists. When you try to tra ce the e go, which is the basis of the p erception of th e worl d and everything else, you find the ego does not exist at all a nd neither does all this cr eation that you see. Q: It is cruel of God’s leela [play ] to make the k nowledge of the Self so h ard. A: Knowing the Self is being the Self, an d being mea ns existence, on e’s own existence. No one denies o ne’s exist ence any more th an one denies one’s eyes, although one cannot see them. The tr ouble lies with your desire to o bjectify the Self, in the same way as you objectify your eyes when you place a mirror be fore them. You have been so accustomed to objectivity that you have lost th e knowledge of yourself, simply because the Self ca nnot be o bjectified. Who is to know th e Self? Can the ins entient body know it? All th e time you speak and thin k of your ‘I’, yet when questioned you deny knowledge of it. You are the Self, yet you ask how to k now the Self. Where then is God’s le ela an d where is its cruelty? Be cause of this denial of th e Self by people the s astras s peak of maya, leela, etc. 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Q: Does my realiz ation help others? A: Yes, certainly. It is the best help possible. But th ere ar e no others to be helped. For a re alized being sees only the Self, just lik e a goldsmith estimating th e gold in various items of jewellery sees only gold. When you identify yourself with th e body then only the forms and shapes are there. But wh en you transcend your body the others disa ppear along with your body-consciousness. Q: Is it so with pl ants, trees, et c.? A: Do they exist at all apart from the Self ? Find it out. You thi nk that you se e them. The thought is projected o ut from the Self. Find ou t from where it rises. Tho ughts will cease to rise an d the Self alone will remai n. Q: I understand theoreti cally. But they are still ther e. A: Yes. It is like a cinema-show. There is th e light on the screen and the shadows flitting across it impres s the audience as the enactment of some pi ece. If in th e same play an audience als o is shown on the screen as part of th e performan ce, the s eer an d the seen will then both be on the screen. Ap ply it to yourself. You are the scr een, the Self has created the ego, the e go has its ac cretions of thoughts which are di splayed as th e world, th e trees an d the plants of which you are asking. In reality, all thes e are n othing b ut the Self. If you se e the Self, the same will be found to be all, everywhere an d always. Nothing but th e Self exists. Q: Yes, I still understand only theoretic ally. Yet the answers are simple, be autiful and convincing. A: Even the thought ‘I do not realize’ is a hi ndrance. In fa ct, the Self al one is. Our real nat ure is mukti. But we are imagi ning w e are b ound and are maki ng various, strenuous attempts to be come free, while we ar e all the whil e free. This will be understood on ly when we reach that stag e. We will be surprised that we were fra ntically trying to att ain somethi ng which w e have always been and are. An illustratio n will make this clear. A man g oes to slee p in this ha ll. He dreams he has gone on a wo rld tour, is roaming ov er hill an d dale, forest and country, desert an d sea, across va rious continents an d after many years of weary and strenuous tra vel, retur ns to this co untry, reaches Tiruv annamalai, enters the a shram and walks into th e hall. Just at th at moment h e wakes up and finds he has not move d an inch but was sleeping w here he lay down. He h as not retur ned after gr eat eff ort to this hall, but is and always has been in th e hall. It is exactly like th at. If it is asked, ‘Why being free d o we imagi ne that we are bound?’ I answer, ‘Why being in the h all did you imagi ne you were on a worl d adventure, crossing hill an d dale, desert an d sea? It is all mind o r maya [illusion].’ Q: How then does ignorance of this o ne and only reality unhappily arise in the c ase of the ajnani [on e who has not realized the Self]? A: The ajnani sees only the mind whi ch is a mere refle ction o f the lig ht of pure consciousness arisin g from the Heart. Of the H eart itself he is ig norant. Wh y? Bec ause his mind is extr overted and has never sought its source. Q: What prevents the infi nite, undifferentiated light of co nsciousness arisi ng from the H eart from revealing itself to the ajnani? A: Just as w ater in a p ot refle cts the enormous sun within th e narrow limits of the p ot, even so the vasanas or latent tendencies of the mind o f the individual, acti ng as t he refle cting medi um, catch the all-pervading, infinite light of consciousness arisin g from the He art. The form of this refle ction is th e phenomenon called the mind. Seeing only this reflection, th e ajnani is deluded int o the belief that he is a finite bei ng, th e jiva, the individual self. Q: What are the obstacles which hinder realizati on of th e Self? A: They are habits o f mind [vas anas]. Q: How to ov ercome the mental h abits [vas anas]? A: By realising th e Self. Q: This is a vi cious circle. 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman A: It is th e ego which raise s such diffic ulties, creating o bstacles a nd then suffering from the perplexity of apparent paradoxes. Find ou t who makes th e enquiries and the Self will be found. Q: Why is this mental bo ndage so p ersiste nt? A: The nature of bondage is merely the risi ng, ruin ous thought ‘I am different from the reality’. Since o ne surely cannot remain se parate from the reality, reject that th ought wh enever it rises. Q: Why do I never remember th at I am the Self? A: People speak of memory and oblivion o f the full ness o f the Self. Oblivio n and memor y are only thought-forms. They will alternate so lo ng as there are thoughts. But re ality lies beyond th ese. Memory or oblivion must be dependent on somethin g. That somethi ng must be f oreign to th e Self as w ell, otherwis e there would no t be oblivion. That up on which memor y and oblivion depend is th e idea of the in dividual self. When one looks for it, this indi vidual ‘I’ is not found because it is not real. Hence this ‘I’ is synonymous with illusi on or ignorance (ma ya, avidya or ajnana]. To know th at there n ever was ignorance is th e goal of all the spirit ual tea chings. Ignorance must be of o ne who is aware. Aw areness is jn ana. Jnana is eter nal an d natural, ajnana is unnatural an d unreal. Q: Having heard this truth, why does not one remain co ntent? A: Because samsk aras [innate ment al tendencies] have not b een destroyed. Unless th e samsk aras ce ase to exist, th ere will always be doubt and confusion. All eff orts are directed to de stroying doubt and confusion. To do so their r oots must be cut. Their ro ots are the samskar as. These are rendered ineffecti ve by practice a s prescribed by the G uru. Th e Guru leaves it to the seeker to do this much so that he might himself fin d out that there is no ignorance. Hearing the truth [srava na] is the first sta ge. If the understanding is not firm one has to pr actice refle ction [manan a] and uninterrupted contemplati on [nididhyasan a] on it. These two p rocesses scorch the seeds of samsk aras so that they are rendered ineffecti ve. Some extraordinary people get unshakable jnana after h earing th e truth o nly once. These are th e advanced seekers. Beginners take longer t o gain it. Q: How did ig norance [avidya] arise at all? A: Ignorance never arose. It has no real bei ng. Th at which is, is only vidya [knowledge]. Q: Why then do I not realize it? A: Because of th e samskar as. However, find out w ho does not realize a nd what he does not realiz e. Then it will be clear that th ere is no avidya? Q: So, it is wro ng to b egin with a go al, is it? A: If there is a g oal to b e reached it ca nnot be p erman ent. The g oal must alre ady be there. We seek to reach the goal with th e ego, but the goal exists be fore the e go. What is in the goal is even prior to ou r birth, that is, to the birt h of the ego. Bec ause we e xist the e go appears to exist to o. If we look on the Self as th e ego then we b ecome the ego, if as the mind w e become th e mind, if as th e body we become th e body. It is the thought which buil ds up sheaths in so many ways. The shadow on the wat er is found to be shaking. Can anyon e stop the shaking of th e shadow? If it would cease to sh ake you would not notice th e water b ut only the light. Similarl y take no notice of th e ego and its activities, bu t see only the light be hind. The e go is the thought ‘I’. The true ‘I’ is the Self. Q: If it is just a question o f giving up ideas the n it is only one step to re alizatio n. A: Realization is alr eady there. The stat e free from tho ughts is the only real state. Ther e is no such action as 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman realizatio n. Is there anyone wh o is not realising th e Self? Does anyone d eny his own existence? Speaking of realizatio n, it implies two selv es – th e one to re alize, the ot her to b e realized. What is not already realized is so ught to be realize d. Once we a dmit our existence, how is it that we d o not know ou r Self? Q: Because of the thoughts, the mind. A: Quite so. It is the mind th at veils ou r happiness. Ho w do we know th at we exist? If you say because of the worl d around us, th en how do you know that you existed in deep sleep? Q: How to get rid o f the mind ? A: Is it the mind t hat wa nts to kill itself ? The mind ca nnot kill itself. So your business is to fin d the r eal nat ure of t he mind. Then you will know that th ere is no mind. When th e Self is so ught, the mind is nowhere. Abiding in th e Self, one need not worry about the mind. Q: Is mukti the s ame as realiz ation? A: Mukti or liber ation is ou r nature. It is another name for us. Ou r wanting mukti is a very funny thing. It is like a man wh o is in the shade, voluntarily leaving t he shade, going into t he sun, feeling the s everity of the heat there, makin g great efforts to g et back into the s hade and then rejoicing, ‘How sw eet is the s hade! I ha ve reached the s hade at last!’ We are all doing exactly the same. We are not diff erent from the reality. We imagin e we are different, that is we create the bheda bhava [the feeling of diff erence] and then undergo great sa dhana [spiritual practices] to get rid of the bheda bhava and realiz e the o neness. Why imagin e or cr eate b heda bhava and then destroy it? Q: This c an be realized only by the grace of the master. I was reading Sri Bhagavata. It says that bliss ca n be had only by the dust of th e master’s feet. I pray for gr ace. A: What is bliss bu t your ow n being? You are not apart from being whi ch is the s ame as bliss. You are n ow thi nking that you are the mind or the b ody which are both changing and transient. But you are unchanging and eter nal. That is wh at you sh ould know. Q: It is darkness an d I am ignorant. A: This ign orance must go . Again, who says ‘I am ign orant’? He must be the witn ess of ig norance. That is wh at you are. Socrates s aid, ‘I know that I do not k now.’ Can it be ignorance? It is wisd om. Q: Why then do I feel un happy when I am in Vellore and feel pe ace in your presence? A: Can the feeli ng in this pl ace be bliss? When you leave this place you say you are unhappy. Therefore this pe ace is not permane nt, it is mixed with un happiness whi ch is felt in another place. Therefore you cannot find bliss in pla ces and in periods of time. It must be perman ent in or der th at it may be useful. It is your ow n being which is perman ent. Be the Self an d that is bliss. Yo u are always that. The Self is always realized. It is not necessary to seek to r ealize what is alre ady and always realized. For you cannot deny your ow n exist ence. That ex istence is co nsciousness, the Self. Unless you exist you ca nnot ask questions. So you must a dmit your own existence. Th at existence is the Self. It is already realiz ed. Th erefore the e ffort to re alize res ults only in your realising your present mistak e – that you have not realized your Self. There is no fresh realizati on. The Self be comes revealed. Q: That will tak e some years. A: Why years ? The idea of time is only in your mind. It is no t in the Self. There is no time for th e Self. Time arises as an idea after the e go arises. But you are the Self beyon d time and space. 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman You exist even in th e absence of time and space. Were it true th at you re alize it later it mea ns that you are not r ealized now. Absence of re alizati on in th e present moment may be repeated at any mome nt in the fut ure, for time is infinite. So too, su ch realization is impermane nt. But that is not true. It is wro ng to c onsider r ealization to b e impermane nt. It is the tru e eternal state w hich c annot change. Q: Yes, I shall understand it in course of time. A: You are already that. Time and space cannot affect the Self. They are in you. So als o all that you see around you is in you. There is a story to illustrate this po int. A lady had a pr ecious ne cklace round her neck. Once in he r excitement she forgot it and thought that the necklace was lo st. She b ecame anxious and looked for it in her h ome bu t could not find it. She asked her frie nds and neighbours if they knew anything ab out the necklace. They did not. At last a ki nd friend of he rs told h er to fe el the necklace round her neck. She found that it had all al ong been round her neck and she was h appy. When o thers asked her later if sh e had found the necklace whic h was l ost, she sai d, ‘Yes, I have found it.’ She still felt that she had recovered a lost jewel. Now did she lose it at all ? It was all al ong round her neck. But judge her feelings. She wa s as happy as if sh e had recovered a lost je wel. Similarl y with u s, we imagine th at we will realize that Self some time, whereas w e are never anything b ut the Self. Q: There must be somethin g that I ca n do to reach this stat e. A: The conception th at there is a goal and a path to it is wrong. We are the g oal or peace always. To get rid o f the notion th at we are not peace is all that is req uired. Q: All bo oks say that the g uidance of a Guru is necessary. A: The Gu ru will say only what I am saying now. He will not give you anything you ha ve not alre ady got. It is impossi ble for anyon e to get what he has not got already. Even if he gets any such thing, it will go as it came. What comes will als o go. What always is will alo ne remain. The Gur u cannot give you anything n ew, whi ch you don’t have already. Removal o f the notion that we ha ve not realized the Self is all that is required. We are alw ays the Self o nly we don’t realize it. We go round and round in search of atma [Self ] saying, ‘Where is atma? Where is it? ’ till at last the d awn of jnana drishti [vision o f knowledge] is reached, and we say, ‘This is atma this is me.’ We should acquire th at vision. When once that visio n is reached, ther e will be no attachments ev en if one mixes with t he worl d and move s about in it. When on ce you put o n shoes your fe et do not feel the pain of walking o n any number o f stones or th orns o n the way. You walk about with out fe ar or care, even if there are mou ntains on the way. In the same way, everything will be natural to th ose w ho have attai ned jnana drishti. What is there ap art from one’s own Self? Q: The natural state c an be known only after all this w orldly vision subsides. But how is it to subside? A: If the mind su bsides, the wh ole world su bsides. Mind is the c ause of all this. If that su bsides, the natural state presents itself. The Self pr oclaims itself at all times as ‘I, I’. It is self-lumino us. It is he re. All this is th at. We are in that o nly. Being in it, why search for it? The a ncients say: ‘Maki ng the vision absorbed in j nana one sees the w orld as Brahman.’’ 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Cha pter 3 - The jna ni Many of the Sri Ramana’s visitors a ppeared to h ave an insatia ble cu riosity about the st ate of Self-reali zation and they were particularly interest ed to k now how a jnani experienced himself an d the worl d around him. Some of the questions he was a sked on the subject reflected th e bizarre no tions that many people had about this stat e, but most of them ten ded to be v ariations of o ne of the f our foll owing questions: 1 How can a jn ani function without any individual aw areness of c onsciousness? 2 How can he say that he ‘does nothing’ (a stateme nt which Sri Raman a often made) wh en others see him acti ve in th e world? 3 How does he perceive the world? Does he perceive the wo rld at all? 4 How do es the jnani’s aw areness of p ure consciousness relat e to the alter nating state s of body and mind consciousness experienced in w aking, dr eaming an d sleeping? The h idden premise be hind all such questions is the b elief th at there is a p erson (th e jnani) who experiences a state h e calls th e Self. This a ssumptio n is not true. It is merely a mental co nstruct de vised by those wh o have not realized the Self (ajnanis) to make s ense of th e jnani’s experience. Even the u se of the wor d jnani is indicative o f this erroneous belief sin ce it literally mean s a knower of jnana, the reality. The ajnani uses this term because he imagines t hat the w orld is made up of seekers of re ality and knowers of reality; the truth o f the Self is that there are neither j nanis nor ajnanis, there is on ly jnana. Sri Rama na pointed this out b oth directly and indirectly on many occasions, but f ew of his q uestioners wer e able to grasp, ev en conceptually, the implicatio ns of s uch a statement. Be cause of this h e usually adapted his id eas in s uch a way that th ey conformed to th e prejudices of his liste ners. In most of th e conversations in this ch apter he accepts that his qu estioners per ceive a disti nction between the jnani and the ajnani, and, with out challenging the basis of that as sumptio n, he assumes th e role of th e jnani and attempts to explain the implicatio ns of be ing in that stat e. Q: Then wh at is the diff erence between the baddha and the mukta, th e bound man an d the one liberated? A: The ordinary man liv es in the b rain u naware o f himself in the He art. The jnana siddha [jn ani] lives in t he He art. When he moves about and deals with men an d things, he knows that wh at he sees is not s eparate fr om the one supreme re ality, the Brahman whic h he realized in th e Heart as his own Self, the real. Q: What about the ordinary man? A: I have just said that he sees things out side himself. He is se parate from the worl d, from his own de eper trut h, from the truth that su pports him and what he sees. The man wh o has realized the supreme trut h of his ow n existence realises that it is the one supreme re ality that is ther e behind him, behind the w orld. In fa ct, he is aw are of th e one, as the r eal, the Self in all sel ves, in all thin gs, eternal an d immutable, in all that is imperma nent and mutable. Q: What is the relatio n between the p ure consciousness realized by the jnani and the ‘I am’- ne ss whi ch is ac cepted as the primary datum of experience? A: The undifferentiated c onsciousness o f pure being is th e Heart or h ridayam, which is what you really are. From the Heart arises th e ‘I am’-n ess as the primary datum of on e’s experience. By itself it is complet ely pure [sudd ha-sattva] in character. It is in this f orm of pristine pu rity [sudd ha- sattva-s warupa], uncontaminated by rajas and tamas [activit y and inertia], that the ‘I’ ap pears to s ubsist in th e jnani. Q: In the jnani the e go subsists in the pure form and therefor e it appears a s somethi ng real. Am I right? A: The appearance of th e ego in any form, either in th e jnani or ajnani, is itself an experience. But to th e ajnani who is deluded into thi nking that the wa king state an d the world a re real, the ego also appears to be real. Since he sees th e jnani act like ot her in dividuals, he feels c onstrained to p osit some no tion of individuality with 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman reference to th e jnani also. Q: How then does the aham-v ritti [‘I’-thought, the sense of individuality] function in the j nani? A: It does not function in him at all. The jnani’s real na ture is th e Heart itself, be cause he is on e and identical with the undifferentiated, pu re consciousness ref erred to by the Up anishads as th e prajnana [full consciousness]. Prajnana is truly Brahman, th e absolute, an d there is no Brahma n other than prajnana. Q: Does a jnani have sankalpas [desir es]? A: The main qu alities of th e ordinary mind are tamas a nd rajas [sloth and excitement]; hence it is full of eg oistic desires an d weaknesses. But th e jnani’s mind is suddha-sattva [pure ha rmony] and formless, functioning in t he subtle vijnanamayakosha [the sh eath of knowledge], through which he keeps contact with th e world. His de sires ar e therefore also p ure. Q: I am trying to understand the jnani’s po int of vi ew ab out th e worl d. Is the worl d perceived aft er Self-r ealization? A: Why worry yourself ab out the worl d and what happens to it after Self-re alizatio n? First realize t he Self. What does it matter if the worl d is perceived or not? Do you gain anythin g to help you in your quest by the non-perception of th e world during sle ep? Conversely, what would you lose now by the perception of th e world? It is qu ite immaterial to the jnani or aj nani if he perceives the w orld or n ot. It is seen by both, bu t their vie w-poi nts differ. Q: If the j nani and the ajnani perceive the worl d in like man ner, wh ere is the diff erence between them? A: Seeing the wo rld, the jnani sees the Self whi ch is the s ubstratum of all that is seen; the ajnani, wh ether he s ees th e world or not, is ignorant of his tru e being, th e Self. Take the in stance of mo ving pi ctures on the scr een in the ci nema-sh ow. What is there in fro nt of you before the pl ay begins? Merely the scr een. On that s creen you see the e ntire sh ow, an d for all a ppearances th e pictures ar e real. But go and try to take hold of them. What do you take hold of? Merely the screen on which the pi ctures appeared. After the play, when the pictures dis appear, wh at remains ? The screen again. So with the Self. That alone exists, the pi ctures come an d go. If you hol d on to the Self, you will not be deceived by the appearance of t he pict ures. No r does it matter at all if the pictures ap pear or d isappear. Ignoring the Self the a jnani thinks the world is re al, just as ignoring the scr een he sees merely the pictures, as if they existed apart from it. If one knows that witho ut the s eer th ere is nothing to be seen, just as there are no pictures wit hout the screen, one is no t deluded. Th e jnani knows that the screen and the pictures are only the Self. With the pictures the Self is in its manif est form; without th e pictures it remains in th e unmanifest form. To th e jnani it is quit e immaterial if the Self is in th e one form or the ot her. He is alw ays the Self. But th e ajnani seeing the jnani active gets confounded. Q: Does Bh agavan see the w orld as part an d parcel of himself? How does he see the worl d? A: The Self alo ne is an d nothing els e. However, it is diff erentiated o wing to ignorance. Differ entiatio n is threefold: (1) of the same kin d; (2) of a diff erent kind; and (3) as parts in itself. The w orld is no t another Self similar to the Self. It is not diff erent fr om the Self; no r is it part of t he Self. Q: Is not the wo rld refle cted on the Self? A: For reflecti on there must be an object and an image. But th e Self do es not admit of these diff erences. Q: Does a jnani have dreams? A: Yes, he does dream, but he knows it to be a dream, in the same way as he knows the wa king state to be a dream. You may call th em dream no.1 and dream no.2. The jnani being establishe d in the f ourth state – turiya, the supreme 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman reality – he detachedly witnesses the t hree ot her states, waking, dr eaming a nd dreamless sleep, as pictures superimpo sed on it. For tho se wh o experience wa king, dream and sleep, the st ate of wa keful sleep, which is beyond th ose thr ee stat es, is named turiya [the fo urth]. But sin ce that turiya alone exists a nd since the seeming thr ee state s do not exi st, know for certain th at turiya is itself turiyatita [that whi ch tra nscends the f ourth]. Q: For th e jnani then, there is no distincti on between the three st ates of mind ? A: How can there be, when the mind itself is diss olved and lost in the light o f consciousness? For the j nani all the three states a re equally unreal. But th e ajnani is unable to compre hend this, be cause for him the sta ndard of re ality is the waking stat e, whereas for th e jnani the sta ndard of reality is reality itself. This re ality of pure consciousness is eternal by its nature and therefor e subsists eq ually during what you call waking, dr eaming an d sleep. To him who is one with th at reality there is neit her th e mind n or its thre e states a nd, th erefore, neit her intro version n or extroversion. His is the ever-waking stat e, because he is awake to th e eternal Self; his is th e ever-dreaming stat e, because to him the world is no better tha n a repeatedly presented dream phenomenon; his is the e ver-sl eeping state, be cause he is at all times without th e ‘body-am-I’ co nsciousness. Q: Is there no dehatma bu ddhi [I-am-the-b ody idea] for the jnani? If, for insta nce, Sri Bhagavan is bitten by an insect, is there no sensation? A: There is the sensatio n and there is also t he dehatma bu ddhi. The latt er is common to both jnani and ajnani with this difference, that th e ajnani thin ks only the body is myself, whereas the j nani knows all is of the Self, or all this is Brahman. If there be pain let it be. It is als o part of th e Self. The Self is po orna [perfe ct]. After tra nscending d ehatma buddhi one becomes a jnani. In th e absence of that id ea ther e cannot be eit her ka rtritva [doers hip] or karta [doer]. So a jn ani has no karma [that is, a jn ani performs no actions]. That is his experience. Otherwise he is not a jnani. Ho wever the a jnani identifies the jnani with his b ody, which the jnani does not do. Q: I see you do ing things. How ca n you say that you never perform acti ons? A: The radio sin gs and speaks, bu t if you open it you will fin d no one inside. Similarly , my existence is like the s pace; though this bo dy speaks like th e radio, there is no one inside as a d oer. Q: I find this hard to un derstand. Could you please elaborate on this? A: Various illustratio ns are given in bo oks to en able us t o understand how the jnani can live a nd act witho ut the mind, although livi ng and acting require the u se of t he mind. The potter’s wh eel go es on turning round even after t he potter has ceased to tur n it because the pot is finis hed. In the s ame way, the electric f an goes on revolving for some minutes after w e switch o ff the current. The prar abdha [prede stined karma] which created the b ody will make it go through whatever acti vities it was meant for. But th e jnani goes through all these activitie s without the notion th at he is th e doer of th em. It is hard to understand how this is possible. The illustrati on generally given is that the j nani performs actions in s ome such way as a c hild th at is roused from sleep to eat ea ts but d oes not remember n ext mor ning th at it ate. It has to be remember ed that all these explanations are n ot for th e jnani. He knows an d has no doubts. He knows that h e is not the body and he knows that h e is not doing anything ev en though his bo dy may be engaged in some activity. These explanations are f or the onlookers wh o thin k of the j nani as one with a bo dy and cannot hel p identifying him with h is body. Q: It is said th at the shock of re alizatio n is so great that th e body cannot survive it. A: There are various controversies or sc hools of th ought as t o whether a j nani can continue to live in his physical body after re alizatio n. Some ho ld that one who dies cannot be a jnani because his body must va nish into air, or some such thi ng. They put forwar d all sorts of f unny notions. If a man must at on ce leave his bo dy when he realis es the Self, I wonder how any knowledge of th e Self or the stat e of realiz ation can come do wn to other men. And that would mean th at all those who have given us the fruits of their Self-re alizatio n in bo oks cannot be c onsidered j nanis because they went on living aft er realization.

The fa ct is that any amou nt of acti on can be performed, an d performe d quite well, by the jnani, with out his id entifying himself with it in any way or ever imaginin g that h e is the doer. Some power acts t hrough his body and uses his body to get th e wor k done. Q: Is a jnani capable of or likely to commit sins? A: An ajnani sees someon e as a j nani and identifies h im with the b ody. Because he does not know the Self an d mistakes hi s body for the Self, he extends th e same mistake to th e state of th e jnani. The jnani is therefore considered to be the physical frame. Again sin ce the ajnani, though he is no t the d oer, imagin es himself to be the doer and considers the actions of the b ody his ow n, he thinks the jnani to be similarly acting w hen the b ody is acti ve. But th e jnani himself kn ows the trut h and is not confounded. Th e state of a j nani cannot be determined by the ajnani and therefore the q uestion tr oubles on ly the ajnani and never arises f or the jnani. If he is a do er he must determine th e nature of the actions. The Self cannot be the d oer. Find out wh o is the d oer and the Self is revealed. Q: So it amounts to this. To see a jnani is no t to understand him. You see the jnani’s bo dy and not his jnana. One must therefore be a jnani to know a jn ani. A: The jnani sees no one as an ajnani. All are only jnanis in his si ght. In th e ignorant state on e superimpo ses on e’s ignorance on a jnani and mistakes him for a do er. In th e state of j nana, the jnani sees nothing separate from the Self. The Self is all shining and only pure jnana. So there is no ajnana in his sig ht. There is an illustratio n for this ki nd of illusio n or superimpo sition. Two frie nds w ent to sle ep sid e by side. On e of th em dreamt that both of them had gone on a long journey and that they had had strange experiences. On waking up he recapitulate d them and asked his frien d if it was not s o. The other on e simply ridiculed him saying that it was only his dream and could not affect the o ther. So it is with th e ajnani who superimpos es his illus ory ideas on others. Q: You have said th at the jnani can be and is active, and deals with men an d things. I have no doubt about it now. But you say at the same time that he sees no differences; to him all is on e, he is alw ays in the consciousness. If so, how does he deal with differ ences, with men, with thin gs whi ch are surely different? A: He sees the se diff erences as but a ppearances, he sees them as not s eparate fr om the tru e, the real, with w hich he is one. Q: The jnani seems to be more accurate in his ex pressions, he appreciates th e differences bett er than the ordinary man. If sugar is sweet a nd wormwoo d is bitter to me, he too seems to realize it so. In fact, all forms, all sounds, all tast es, etc., are the same to him as they are to ot hers. If so, ho w can it be said that these are mere appearances? Do th ey not form part of his life-e xperience? A: I have said that eq uality is the true si gn of j nana. The very term equality implies the e xistence of differ ences. It is a unity that th e jnani perceives in all differ ences, whi ch I call eq uality. Equality does not mean ig norance of di stinctio ns. When you have the realizatio n you can see that these differences are very superficial, that they are not at all su bstantial or permane nt, and what is ess ential in all th ese ap pearances is the one truth, the real. That I call u nity. You referr ed to s ound, tast e, form, smell, etc. True th e jnani appreciates th e distinctions, but he always perceives and experiences the o ne reality in all of th em. That is why he has no preferences. Whether h e move s about, or talk s, or acts, it is all the o ne reality in which h e acts or move s or talks. He h as nothing apart from the one supreme trut h. Q: They say that the jnani conducts himself with ab solute eq uality towards all? A: Yes. Friendship, kindness, happiness an d such other bhavas [attitudes] become n atural to them. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Affection to wards the good, kindness tow ards th e helpless, ha ppiness in do ing good deeds, for giveness towards the wicked, all su ch things are natural characteristics of th e jnani (Pata njali, Yoga Sutras, 1:3 7).

In their daily routine o f taking food, movin g about and all th e rest, they, the jnanis, act only for others. Not a single acti on is do ne for themselve s. I have already told you many times that j ust as there are people whose profession is to mourn f or a fee, so also the jnanis do things for the sake of others with det achment, without themselv es bei ng aff ected by them. The jnani weeps with the w eeping, la ughs with the la ughing, plays with the playful, sings with th ose w ho sing, keeping time to the song. What does he lose? His presence is like a pure, transparent mirror. It reflects th e image exactly as it is. But the j nani, wh o is only a mirror, is unaffected by actions.

Q: Do not Hin du sastras s peak of mukti ? A: Mukti is synonymous with the Self. Jivan mukti [liberate d while still in the body] and videha mukti are all for th e ignorant. The jnani is not conscious of mukti or ba ndha [bondage]. Bondage, liber ation a nd orders of mukti are all said for an ajnani in or der th at ignorance might be shaken off. There is only mukti and nothing else. Q: It is all right from the standpoint of B hagavan. But w hat ab out us? A: The diff erence ‘he’ an d ‘I’ ar e the obstacles to jn ana.

Is there any desire left in him to choose? A: No, that wa s not my intention.

A: That ca nnot be Sankara’s vi ew. In ve rse 566 of Vive-k achudamani he s ays that after th e dissolutio n of the p hysical sheath the liber ated man becomes like ‘w ater po ured int o water an d oil int o oil’. It is a state in w hich t here is ne ither bondage nor liber ation. Taki ng another bo dy mean s throwi ng a v eil, however subtle, upon reality, which is bondage. Liberation is ab solute an d irrevocable. Q: How can we say the jnani is no t in two pl anes? He mov es about with us in th e world a nd sees the various objects we see. It is not as if he does not see them. For in stance he walks along. He s ees th e path he is tre ading. Suppose there is a chair or ta ble pla ced across th at path; he sees it, avoids it and goes round. So, have we not to admit he sees the world and the objects ther e, while of co urse he sees the Self? A: You say the jnani sees the path, trea ds it, comes acr oss ob stacles, av oids them, etc. In whose eye- sight is all this, in the jnani’s o r yours? He sees only the Self an d all in th e Self. Q: Are there n ot illustratio ns given in our books to e xplain this sa haja [natural] state cl early to us? A: There are. For insta nce you se e a reflection in th e mirror and the mirror.

A few of his a dvanced devotees w ere ab le to do this qui ckly and easily, but the others found it virtually impossi ble to dis card the ingrained habits o f a lifetime without un dertaking some f orm of spirit ual practice. Sri Ramana sympathised with th eir predicame nt and whenever he was asked to p rescribe a spiritual pr actice which wo uld facilitate Self-aw areness he would re commend a te chnique he called self-e nquiry. This pr actice was the cornerstone of his pr actical philosophy and the next thr ee chapters will be devoted to a det ailed presentatio n of all its aspects. Before embar king on a descriptio n of th e technique itself it will be necessary to explain Sri Ramana’s v iews o n the nature of the mind sin ce the aim of self-e nquiry is to d iscover, by direct ex perience, that th e mind is no n-existent. According to Sri Raman a, every conscious activity of the mind o r body revolves around the tacit as sumptio n that ther e is an ‘I’ wh o is doi ng somethin g. The common fa ctor in ‘I thin k’, ‘I remember’, ‘I am acting’ is the ‘I’ wh o assumes that it is responsible for all th ese ac tivities. Sri Raman a calle d this common f actor th e ‘I’-tho ught (aham-vritti). Literally aham-vritti means ‘mental modific ation o f I’. Th e Self or r eal ‘I’ never imagin es that it is doing or thi nking anything; th e ‘I’ that imagines all this is a ment al fiction and so it is calle d a mental modific ation o f the Self. Since this is a rath er cumb ersome tra nslatio n of ah am-vritti it is usually translated as ‘I’-th ought. Sri Rama na upheld the v iew th at the notion o f individuality is only the ‘I’-th ought manifesti ng itself in diff erent w ays. Instead of regarding the different acti vities of th e mind (s uch as eg o, intelle ct and memor y) as separate fu nctions he preferre d to vi ew them all as different forms of the ‘I’-t hought. Since he equated individuality with the mind a nd the mind with the ‘I’-t hought it follow s that the di sappearance of the s ense of in dividuality (i.e. Self-r ealization) implies the disappearance of both the mind a nd the ‘I’-th ought. This is confirmed by his frequent statements t o the eff ect that after Self-re alizatio n ther e is no thinker of thoughts, no performer of actions and no awareness o f individual existence. Since h e upheld the notion that the Self is the only existi ng reality he regarded the ‘I’-th ought as a mistake n assumption w hich has no real existence of its own. H e explained its ap pearance by saying that it can only appear to exist by identifying with a n object. When th oughts aris e the ‘I’- th ought claims ownership of th em - ‘I think’, ‘I believe’, ‘I wa nt’, ‘I am acti ng’ - but th ere is no separate ‘I’-thought that exi sts independently of the o bjects that it is identifying with. It only appears to exist as a real co ntinuous entity because of the incessant flow o f identificatio ns which are continually taking p lace. Almost all of th ese id entific ations c an be traced back to an initial assumption th at the ‘I’ is limited to the body, either as a n owner-occupant or co-e xtensive with its physical form. This ‘I am the body’ idea is the primary source of all s ubsequent wrong identificatio ns and its diss olutio n is the pri ncipal aim of self- enquiry. Sri Rama na maintain ed that this tendency towards self-limiting identificatio ns could be checked by trying to separate the subject ‘I’ from the objects of th ought w hich it ide ntified with. Sinc e the individual ‘I’-th ought ca nnot exi st without an object, if atte ntion is focused on the subjective feeling of ‘I’ or ‘I am’ with such inte nsity that the thoughts ‘I am this’ o r ‘I am that’ do not arise, the n the in dividual ‘I’ will be unable to co nnect wit h objects. If this awareness of ‘I’ is sustained, the individual ‘I’ (the ‘I’-th ought) will disappear an d in its pla ce there will be a direct ex perience of the Self. This co nstant atte ntion to th e inner awareness of ‘I’ or ‘I am’ was called self-en quiry (vichara) by Sri Raman a and he constantly recommende d it as the most efficie nt and dire ct way of discovering the unreality of the ‘I’-thought. In Sri Ramana’s termin ology the ‘I’-th ought rise s from the Self o r the He art and subsides back int o the Self wh en its tendency to ide ntify itself with th ought ob jects ceases. Bec ause of this he often tailore d his ad vice to co nform to this image of a rising and subsiding ‘I’. He might say ‘trace the ‘I’-th ought back to its source’, or ‘fin d out w here the ‘I’ rises fr om’, but the implic ation w as always the same. Whate ver th e language used he w as advising his de votees to maintain a wareness of th e ‘I’-thought until it dissolved in th e source from which it came. 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman He sometimes mentio ned that thin king or repeating ‘I’ mentally would also lead one in th e right dir ection but it is importa nt to note that this is only a preliminar y stage of th e practice. Th e repetition of ‘I’ still involves a s ubject (the ‘I’-thought) ha ving a pe rception of an object (the th oughts ‘I, I’) and while s uch duality exists the ‘I’-th ought will continue to thri ve. It only finally disappears wh en the perception o f all objects, both physical and mental, ceases. This is not brought about by being aw are of an ‘I’, but only by being the ‘I’. This stage of ex periencing the subject rather than being aware of an object is the culminating p hase of s elf-enquiry and it will be explained in gr eater d etail in th e following c hapter. This importa nt distincti on is the k ey element whi ch disti nguishes self-en quiry from nearly all oth er spiritu al practices and it explains w hy Sri Ramana c onsistently maint ained that most oth er practice s were in effective.

In his vi ew such practices may effectively quieten th e mind, and they may even produce blissf ul experiences, but they will never culmin ate in Self- realization b ecause the ‘I’-thought is not being isolated and deprived of its ide ntity.

The practical as pects of the te chnique will be explained in gr eater d etail in ch apter 5. Q: What is the nature of the mind? A: The mind is not hing other tha n the ‘I’-th ought. The mind a nd the ego are one and the same. The o ther ment al faculties such as th e intelle ct and the memory are only this. Mind [tnanas], intell ect [bud dhi], the storehouse of mental te ndencies [chittam ], and ego [ahamkar a]; all th ese ar e only the one mind itself. This is like different nam es bei ng given to a man ac cording to his diff erent functions. Th e individual soul [jiv a] is nothing b ut this soul or ego. Q: How shall we discover the nature of the mind, th at is, its ultimate cause, or the n oumenon of whi ch it is a manifest ation? A: Arranging thoughts in th e order of value, the ‘I’-thought is the all-importa nt thought. Personality- idea or thought is also the root or th e stem of all other thoughts, since each idea or th ought aris es only as someone’s thought and is not known to ex ist independently of the e go. Th e ego ther efore exhibits th ought-activity . The second and the thir d persons [he, you, that, etc.] do not appear except to the first per son [I]. Therefore they arise only after t he first person appears, so all the thr ee persons seem to rise a nd sink together. Trace, then, the ultimate cause of ‘I’ or personality . From where does this ‘I’ arise? Seek for it within; it then vanishes. This is the pursuit of wis dom. When th e mind unceasingly investigates its ow n nature, it transpires th at there is no such thi ng as mind. This is the d irect pa th for all. The mind is merely thoughts. Of all th oughts th e thought ‘I’ is the r oot. Ther efore the mind is only the th ought ‘I’. The b irth of th e ‘I’-thought is one’s own birth, its death is the person’s de ath. After th e ‘I’- thought has aris en, the wrong identity with t he body arises. Get rid o f the ‘I’-th ought. So long as ‘I’ is alive th ere is gri ef. When ‘I’ ce ases to exist there is no grief. Q: Yes, but wh en I ta ke to th e ‘I’-thought, other th oughts a rise an d disturb me. A: See whose th oughts they are. They will vanish. They have their root in th e single ‘I’- thought. Hold it and they will disappear. Q: How can any enquiry initiate d by the ego reveal its ow n unreality? A: The ego’s phenomenal ex istence is tra nscended when you dive int o the source from where the ‘I’-th ought rises. Q: But is no t the aham-vritti only one of the thr ee forms in whi ch the ego manifests itself. Yo ga Vasisht ha and other ancient texts de scribe the ego as ha ving a thr eefold form. A: It is so. Th e ego is described as h aving three b odies, the g ross, th e subtle and the causal, but that is only for the 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman purpose of analytical exposition. If the method of enquiry were to depend on the ego’s form, you may take it that any enquiry would be come altogether impossible, be cause the forms the e go may assume are legi on. Th erefor e, for the purposes o f self-en quiry you have to pr oceed on the basis that the e go has but one form, namely that of aham-vritti. Q: But it may prove inadequate f or realisin g jnana. A: Self-e nquiry by followin g the clue of a ham-vritti is just lik e the d og tracing his master by his scent. The master may be at some dista nt unknown place, but that does not st and in the way of the dog traci ng him. The master’s sc ent is an infallible cl ue for the animal, and nothing else, such as the d ress h e wears, or his b uild an d stature, etc., co unts. To that scent the dog holds on undistractedly while searching for him, and finally it succeeds in tracing him. Q: The question still remains w hy the quest for th e source of aham-v ritti, as distin guished from other v rittis [modifications o f the mind], should be considered the direct means to Self-re alizatio n. A: Although the c oncept of ‘I’-ne ss or ‘I am’- ness is by usage known as ah am-vritti it is not really a vritti [modification] like other vrittis of the mind. Because unli ke the other vrittis which have no essential int errelatio n, the aham-vritti is equally and essentially related to each and every vritti of the mind. Without the aham-vritti there c an be no other vritti, but the aham-vritti can subsist by itself with out de pending on any other vritti of th e mind. Th e aham- vritti is therefore fu ndamentally different from other vrittis. So the n, the search for the s ource of t he aham-vritti is not merely the search for th e basis of one of th e forms of the ego but for the v ery source itself from whic h arises the ‘I am’- ness. In other words, the quest for a nd the realizatio n of the source of t he ego in th e form of aham-vritti ne cessarily implies the tra nscendence of the e go in every one of its possible forms. Q: Conceding that the aham-vritti essentially compris es all the f orms of the ego, why should th at vritti alone be chosen as the mean s for self-e nquiry? A: Because it is the o ne irreducible datum of your experience and because seeking its so urce is the only practicable course you ca n adopt to realize the Self. The ego is sai d to have a causal bo dy [the stat e of the ‘I’ du ring sleep], but how can you make it the subject of your investigatio n? When th e ego adopts that form, you are immersed in th e darkness o f sleep. Q: But is no t the ego in its su btle an d causal forms too inta ngible to be tackled thr ough the enquiry into th e source of aham-vritti conducted while th e mind is aw ake? A: No. The e nquiry into the s ource of a ham-vritti touches the very existence of the e go. Therefore the s ubtlety of the e go’s form is not a material consideratio n. Q: While the one aim is to re alize th e unconditioned, pure being of the Self, which is in n o way dependent on the ego, how can enquiry pertaining to th e ego in the f orm of ah am-vritti be of any use? A: From the functional point of view th e ego has one and only one characteristic. The ego functions as th e knot between the Self whi ch is pu re consciousness an d the physical body which is inert and insentient. The ego is therefore called the chit-jada-granthi [the kn ot between consciousness a nd the inert b ody]. In your investigation into th e source of aham-vritti, you take the essential ch it [consciousness] aspect of th e ego. For this reason the enquiry must lead to the realization of p ure consciousness of the Self. You must distinguish b etween the ‘I’, pure in itself, and the ‘I’-tho ught. The latter, bei ng merely a thought, sees subject and object, sleeps, wakes up, e ats an d thinks, di es and is reborn. But th e pure ‘I’ is the pure bei ng, eternal existence, fre e from ignorance and thought-illusi on. If you stay as the ‘I’, your being alone, without thought, the ‘I’-thought will disappear and the d elusion will va nish for ever. In a cinema-sh ow you can see pictures only in a very dim light or in da rkness. But wh en all the lights ar e switc hed on, the p ictures dis appear. So als o in the flo odlight of th e supreme atman all ob jects disappear. Q: That is the trans cendental stat e. A: No. Tran scending wh at, and by whom? You alone exist. 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Q: It is said th at the Self is beyond th e mind a nd yet the realization is with th e mind. ‘The mind ca nnot think it.

A: Atman is realized with mruta mana s [dead mind], that is, mind devoid of thoughts an d turned inward. Then the mind se es its own source and becomes that [the Self]. It is not as th e subject perceiving an object. When th e room is dark a lamp is necessary to illumine an d eyes to cognise objects.

Then mind los es itself and Heart shines forth. The e ssence of mind is only awareness or c onsciousness. When th e ego, however, dominat es it, it functions a s the reasoning, thinking or s ensing faculty. The cosmic mind, being no t limited by the ego, has nothing separate from itself and is ther efore only aware. This is what th e Bible mean s by ‘I am that I am’.

It is devoid of prama da [forgetf ulness of Self] which is the cause of birt h and death. Q: How is the ego to b e destroyed ? A: Hold the ego first and then ask how it is to be destroyed. Who asks the question? It is the e go. This q uestion is a sure way to cherish th e ego and not to kill it. If you seek the e go you will find that it does not exist. That is the w ay to destroy it. Q: How is realization mad e possible? A: There is an absolute Self from which a s park proceeds as from a fire. The spark is call ed the ego. In the case of an ignorant man it identifies itself with an object simultan eously with its rise. It cannot remai n independent of s uch association with o bjects. The association is aj nana or ignorance and its de structi on is the o bject of our efforts. If its objectifying tendency is kille d it remains p ure, and also merg es into th e source. Th e wrong identificati on with th e body is dehatma buddhi [‘I am the b ody’ idea]. This must go before good results f ollow. The ‘I’ in its pu rity is experienced in int ervals between the two stat es or two th oughts. Eg o is like that ca terpillar which leaves its hold only after cat ching another. Its tru e nature can be found when it is out of co ntact with ob jects or thoughts. This gh ostly ego which is devoid of form comes int o existence by grasping a form; grasping a form it endures; feeding upon forms which it grasps it wa xes more; le aving one form it grasps another form, but w hen sought for it takes to flig ht. Only if that first pe rson, the e go, in th e form ‘I am the body’, exists will the second and third pe rsons [you, he, they, etc.] exist. If by one’s sc rutinisi ng the truth of th e first p erson the first pe rson is de stroyed, the second and third persons will cease to ex ist and one’s own nature w hich will the n shine as o ne will truly be the state of Self. The thought ‘I am this body of flesh and blood’ is the o ne thread on which are str ung the various oth er tho ughts. Therefore, if we t urn inw ards e nquiring ‘Wher e is this I?’ all thoughts (including the ‘I’-th ought) will come to an end and Self-kn owledge will then spontaneously shine forth. Q: When I re ad Sri Bhagavan’s w orks I find that in vestigation is said to be the one meth od for realization. A: Yes, that is vi chara [self- enquiry]. Q: How is that to be done? 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman A: The questioner must admit the e xistence of his Self. ‘I am’ is the realizatio n. To pursue the clue till realization is vichara. Vichara an d realizatio n are the same. Q: It is elusive. What sh all I meditat e upon? A: Meditatio n requires a n object to meditat e upon, whereas there is only the subject without the object in v ichara. Meditati on diff ers from vichara in this w ay. Q: Is not dhyana [meditation] one of the effici ent pr ocesses f or realization? A: Dhyana is concentration on an object. It fulfils th e purpose of ke eping away diverse th oughts a nd fixing the mind on a single tho ught, which must als o disappear b efore re alizatio n. But realization is no thing new to be acquired. It is already there, but obstructed by a screen of th oughts. All our attempts are dire cted to lifting this scr een and then realization is re vealed. If seekers are advised to meditat e, many may go away satisfie d with the a dvice. But some one among them may turn round and ask, ‘Who am I to medit ate on an object?’ Such a one must be told to find the Self. That is the finality . That is vichara. Q: Will vichara alone do in the absence of meditatio n? A: Vichara is the p rocess a nd the goal also. ‘I am’ is the goal and the final re ality. To hold to it with eff ort is vichara. When sp ontaneous and natural it is realizati on. If one leaves aside vi chara, the most effic acious sadhana, there are no other ad equate means w hatsoever to make t he mind su bside. If mad e to subside by other mea ns, it will remain as if subsided but will rise a gain. Self- en quiry is the o ne infallible mea ns, the only direct on e, to re alize th e unconditioned, absolute bei ng that you re ally are. Q: Why should self-en quiry alone be considered the direct means to jn ana? A: Because every kind of sadhana except th at of atma-vic hara [self-en quiry] presupposes the ret ention of the mind a s the instrument for c arrying on the sadhana, an d with out th e mind it ca nnot be p ractised. Th e ego may take different and subtler forms at the diff erent stages of on e’s practice, but is itself ne ver destroyed. When Ja naka exclaimed, ‘Now I have discovered the thief wh o has been ruining me all along. He shall be d ealt with s ummaril y’, the king was really referrin g to th e ego or the mind. Q: But th e thief may well be apprehended by the other sadhanas as well. A: The attempt to de stroy the ego or the mind thr ough sadhanas ot her th an atma-vi chara is just like th e thief pretending to be a policeman to ca tch the thief, th at is, himself. Atma-vi chara alone can reveal the tr uth that ne ither the ego nor the mind really exists, an d enable one to re alize th e pure, undifferentiate d being of the Self or th e absolute. Having realized the Self, no thing remains to b e known, because it is perfect bliss, it is the all. Q: Why is self-en quiry more dir ect tha n other metho ds? A: Attention to on e’s own Self, which is ever shining as ‘I’, the o ne undivided and pure reality, is the o nly raft with which the individual, who is de luded by thinking ‘I am th e body’, can cross th e ocean of un ending birth s. Reality is simply the loss of e go. Destroy the ego by seeking its identity. Because the ego is no entity it will automatically vanish and reality will shine forth by itself. This is th e direct meth od, wh ereas all other methods are done only by retaining the ego. In those paths there aris e so many doubts an d the eternal qu estion ‘Who am I? ’ remains to b e tackled finally. But in this meth od the final qu estion is the o nly one and it is rais ed from the beginning. No sadhanas ar e necessary for engaging in this qu est. There is no greater myster y than this – that bei ng the reality we seek to ga in reality. We think t hat ther e is somethin g hiding o ur reality and that it must be destroyed before th e reality is gai ned. It is ridic ulous. A day will da wn when you will yourself la ugh at your pa st efforts. That whi ch will be o n the day you laugh is also here and now. 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Chapter 5 - Self-enquiry – practice Beginners in self-e nquiry were advised by Sri Rama na to pu t their atte ntion on the inner feeli ng of ‘I’ an d to h old th at feeling as long as possible. They would be told that if their atte ntion w as distra cted by other th oughts th ey should revert to aw areness o f the ‘I’-th ought wh enever they became aw are th at their atte ntion ha d wandered. He su ggested various aids to a ssist this pr ocess – one could ask oneself ‘Who am I? ’ or ‘Wher e does this I come from ?’ - bu t the ultimate aim was to be continuously aware of th e ‘I’ which a ssumes th at it is res ponsible f or all the acti vities of th e body and the mind. In the early stages of pr actice attention to th e feeling ‘I’ is a mental activity which takes the f orm of a th ought or a perception. As the practice develops the thought ‘I’ gives w ay to a subjectively experienced feeling of ‘I’, and when this fe eling c eases to co nnect and identify with tho ughts an d objects it compl etely vanishes. What remains is an experience of b eing in whi ch the sense of in dividuality has temp orarily ceased to o perate. The e xperience may be intermittent at first but with re peated p ractice it becomes ea sier an d easier to re ach and maintain. When self-e nquiry reaches this le vel ther e is an effortless a wareness of being in which individual effort is no longer po ssible sin ce the ‘I’ who makes t he eff ort has temp orarily ceased to e xist. It is no t Self-r ealizati on sin ce the ‘I’-thought periodically reasserts itself bu t it is the hi ghest lev el of practice. Re peated e xperience of this state o f being we akens and destroys the vasanas (mental ten dencies) which cause the ‘I’-th ought to rise, an d, when their hold has been suffi ciently weakened, the p ower of the Self de stroys the re sidual tendencies s o compl etely that the ‘I’-th ought ne ver rises again. This is the fin al and irreversible st ate of Self-re alizatio n. This pr actice of self-att ention or awareness o f the ‘I’-th ought is a ge ntle te chnique which bypasse s the usual repressi ve metho ds of c ontrolling th e mind. It is not a n exercise in co ncentration, nor does it aim at suppressing thoughts; it merely invokes awareness of th e source from which the mind spri ngs. The meth od and goal of self- enquiry is to abide in th e source of the mind an d to b e aware of what on e really is by withdrawing attention and interest from what on e is not. In t he early stages eff ort in the form of tra nsferrin g attention fr om the thoughts to the thinker is es sential, but once awareness of the ‘I’-f eeling has been firml y establis hed, further e ffort is counter- productive. From then on it is more a pr ocess of b eing than doing, of e ffortles s being rat her tha n an effort to be . Being what one already is is eff ortless sin ce beingness is always present and always experienced. On the ot her hand, pretending to be w hat on e is no t (i.e. Th e body and the mind) re quires continuous mental effort, ev en though the eff ort is nearly always at a subconscious le vel. It therefore follows th at in the higher stages of self-e nquiry effort tak es attention a way from the experience of be ing while th e cessation of mental eff ort reveals it. Ultimatel y, the Self is not discovered as a r esult of do ing anything, but o nly by being. As Sri Raman a himself once remark ed: ‘D o not meditat e – be! Do not thin k that you are – b e! Don’t think about being – you are!’ Self-en quiry should not be regarded as a meditatio n practice th at takes place at cert ain ho urs and in certain po sitions; it should co ntinue thr oughout one’s waking hours, irrespective of what one is doing. Sri Raman a saw no conflict between wor king and self-e nquiry and he maintai ned that with a little practice it could be done under any circumstan ces. He di d sometimes say that regular pe riods of formal pr actice w ere go od for be ginners, but he never advocated long periods of sitting medit ation an d he always showed his disapproval when any of his d evotees expressed a de sire to gi ve up their mun dane activities in fa vour of a meditativ e life. Q: You say one can realize th e Self by a search for it. What is the character of t his search? A: You are the mind or think that you are the mind. Th e mind is nothing bu t thoughts. Now be hind every particular thought ther e is a general thought which is the ‘I’, that is yourself. Let us call this ‘I’ th e first th ought. Stick to this ‘I’-thought an d question it to find ou t what it is. When this q uestion ta kes strong hold on you, you ca nnot thin k of other th oughts. 34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Q: When I do this an d clin g to m y self, that is, the ‘I’-tho ught, other thoughts come an d go, but I say to myself ‘Who am I?’ and there is no answer forthcoming. To be in this co ndition is the p ractice. Is it so? A: This is a mistake that p eople oft en mak e. What ha ppens when you make a serious quest for t he Self is that the ‘I’-thought dis appears and somethi ng els e from the depths takes hold of you and that is not the ‘I’ whi ch commence d the quest.

Q: But you have often sai d that on e must re ject other thoughts when one begins the q uest but the thoughts are endless. If one thought is rejected, an other comes a nd there s eems to be n o end at all. A: I do not say that you must go on rejecting thoughts. Cling to yourself, that is, to the ‘I’- thought. When your interest keeps you to that sin gle id ea, oth er tho ughts will automatic ally get rejected and they will vanish. Q: And so rejection of th oughts is no t necessary? A: No. It may be necessary for a time or for some. Yo u fancy that there is no end if on e goes on rejecting every thought wh en it rises. It is no t true, ther e is an end. If you are vigilant and make a st ern eff ort to reject every thought when it rises you will soon find that you are going deeper and deeper into your own in ner self.

A: Here it is impossible f or you to be without effort. When you go deeper, it is impossibl e for you to mak e any effort. If the mind be comes introverted through enquiry into th e source of aham-v ritti, the vasanas become exti nct. The lig ht of the Self falls o n the vasanas and produces the p henomenon of refle ction w e call th e mind. Th us, when the vasanas become e xtinct the mind also d isappears, bei ng absorbed int o the light o f the one reality, the He art. This is the s um and substance of all that a n aspirant needs to kn ow. What is imper atively required of him is an earnest and one-pointed e nquiry into the s ource of th e aham-vritti? Q: How should a beginner start this pr actice? A: The mind will subside o nly by means of th e enquiry ‘Who am I?’ The th ought ‘Who am I?’, destroying all other thoughts, will itself fin ally be destroyed like th e stick u sed for stirring th e funeral pyre. If oth er tho ughts rise on e should, without attempting to com plete th em, enquire ‘To whom did they rise?’ What does it matter ho wever many thoughts rise ? At the very moment that ea ch thought rises, if one vigilantly enquires ‘To whom did this rise?’, it will be known ‘To me’. If one then enquires ‘Who am I? ’, the mind will turn b ack to its source [the Self] and the thought which had risen will also subside. By repeatedly practising th us, the power of the mind to a bide in its source increases. Although tendencies towar ds sense-objects [vishaya vasanas], which have been recurring down the ages, rise in countless num bers lik e the wa ves of the ocean, they will all pe rish as meditation o n one’s nature be comes more a nd more inte nse. Without givi ng room even to the d oubting thought, ‘Is it po ssible to destroy all th ese te ndencies [vasanas] and to remain as Self alone?’, one should pe rsistently cling fast to self-att ention. As long as t here a re ten dencies towards sense-objects in th e mind, the enquiry ‘Who am I? ’ is ne cessary. As and when thoughts rise, on e should annihilat e all of them through enquiry then and there in their ve ry place of origin. Not attending to wh at-is-ot her [anya ] is non-attachment [vaira gya] or desirelessness [niras a]. Not leaving Self is knowledge [jn ana]. In truth, these two [desireles sness an d knowledge] are one and the same. Just as a p earl-d iver, tying a sto ne to hi s waist, dives into th e sea and takes the pearl lying at the b ottom, so everyone, diving deep within himself with no n-attachment, can attain th e pearl of Self.

Q: The yogis say that on e must re nounce this worl d and go off into s ecluded jungles if on e wish es to fin d the trut h. A: The life of a ction need not be renounced.

A: Because you are accustomed to ide ntify yourself with the b ody and sight with the eyes, therefore you say you do not see anything. What is there t o be seen? Who is to s ee? How to se e? There is on ly one consciousness w hich, manifesti ng as ‘I’-th ought, id entifies itself with th e body, projects itself thr ough the eyes and sees th e objects around.

But he will no t admit that the seer, the seen and the seeing are all manife station s of the s ame consciousness – namely, ‘I, I’. Co ntemplatio n helps one to ov ercome the illusi on that the Self must be visual. In truth, th ere is nothing visual. How do you feel the ‘I’ no w? Do you hold a mirror be fore you to know your own being? The awareness is the ‘I’. Realize it and that is the trut h. Q: On enquiry into th e origin o f thoughts ther e is a perception o f ‘I’. But it does not s atisfy me. 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman A: Quite rig ht. The perception of ‘I’ is associated with a form, maybe the body. There sh ould be nothing a ssociated with th e pure Self. Th e Self is the u nassociated, pure reality, in wh ose light the b ody and the ego shine. On stilling all thoughts th e pure consciousness remains. Just on waking from sleep and before be comin g aware of th e worl d there is that pure ‘I, I’. Hol d on to it witho ut sleeping or with out allo wing th oughts to possess you. If that is held firm it does not matter ev en if the world is se en. The seer remain s unaffected by the phenomena. What is the ego? Enquire. The body is insentient an d cannot say ‘I’. The Self is pure consciousness a nd non-dual. It cannot say ‘I’. No one says ‘I’ in sleep. What is the ego then? It is somet hing int ermediate b etween the inert b ody and the Self. It has no locus sta ndi. If sought for it vanishes lik e a ghost. At night a man may imagi ne that there is a g host by his side because of t he play of shadows. If he looks clos ely he discovers th at the ghost is no t really there, an d what he imagi ned to be a ghost was merely a tree or a post. If he does not l ook closely the ghost may terrify him. All that is required is to look clos ely and the ghost va nishes. Th e ghost was n ever ther e. So also with th e ego. It is an intangible link b etween the body and pure consciousness. It is no t real. So long as one does not look closely at it, it continues to give tro uble. But wh en one looks for it, it is found no t to exi st. There is another story which illustr ates this. In Hin du marria ge functions the feasts o ften c ontinue for five o r six days. On one of these occasions a stranger w as mistake n for the b est man by the bri de’s p arty and they therefore tre ated him with sp ecial regard. Seeing him treated with s pecial regard by the bride’s party, the bri degroom’s pa rty considered him to be some man o f import ance relat ed to th e brid e’s pa rty and therefore they too showed him special re spect. The stranger had altogether a happy time of it. He was al so all alo ng aware of the r eal situatio n. On one occasion the groom’s party wanted to r efer to him on some p oint a nd so they asked the bri de’s p arty about him. Immediately he scented trou ble an d mad e himself scarce. So it is with the e go. If lo oked for, it disappears. If not, it continues to g ive trouble. Q: If I try to make th e ‘Who am I? ’ enquiry, I fall into slee p. What sh ould I do? A: Persist in the enquiry throughout your waking hours. Th at would be quite en ough. If you keep on makin g the enquiry till you fall asl eep, the enquiry will go on during sl eep al so. Tak e up the enquiry again as soon as you wa ke up. Q: How can I get peace? I do not seem to obtain it through vichara. A: Peace is your natural state. It is the mind that ob structs the n atural state. If you do not experience peace it means that your vichara h as been made on ly in the mind. Investigat e what th e mind is, and it will disappear. There is no such thing as mind ap art from thought. Neverthel ess, because of t he emerg ence of th ought, you surmise somethin g from which it starts and term that the mind. When you probe to see what it is, you find ther e is really no such thing a s mind. When th e mind h as thus vanished, you realize eternal pe ace. Q: When I am engaged in enquiry as to th e source from which the ‘I’ springs, I arrive at a sta ge of stillness of mind beyon d which I find myself unable to pr oceed further. I have no thought of any kind and there is an empti ness, a blankness. A mild light pe rvades and I feel that it is myself bodiless. I have neither c ognition nor vision o f body and form. The experience lasts ne arly half an hour and is ple asing. Would I be correct in c oncluding that all that wa s necessary to secure et ernal happiness, th at is fre edom or salvation or w hatever one calls it, was to continue the practice till this experience could be maintain ed for hours, days and mont hs tog ether? A: This do es not mean sal vation. Such a condition is terme d manolaya or temporary stillness o f thought. Manolaya means concentratio n, temporarily arresting the movement of th oughts. As s oon as this co ncentration ceases, th oughts, old and new, rush in a s usual; and even if this tempor ary lullin g of mind sh ould last a th ousand years, it will never lead to total de struction o f thought, which is wh at is called liber ation from birth an d death. The practition er must therefore be e ver on the alert an d enquire withi n as to wh o has this ex perience, who realise s its pleasantness. Without this en quiry he will go into a l ong trance or de ep sleep [yoga nidra]. Due to th e absence of a proper guide at this sta ge of spirit ual pr actice, many have been deluded and fallen a p rey to a false s ense of liber ation a nd only a few ha ve managed to rea ch the goal safely. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman The followin g story illustrates th e point very well. A yogi was doing penance [tapas] for a num ber of years on the banks of th e Ganges. When h e had attai ned a high degree of co ncentration, he believed that continuance in th at stage for pr olonged periods constitute d liber ation a nd practised it. One day, before going into de ep concentratio n, he felt thirsty and called to his dis ciple to b ring a little dri nking water fr om the Ganges. But b efore the di sciple arrived with the water, he h ad gone into yoga ni dra and remaine d in that stat e for countless years, during w hich time much w ater flowed under the b ridge. When he woke up from this ex perience he immediatel y called ‘Water! Water!’; but there wa s neither his d isciple nor the Ga nges in sig ht. The first thin g whi ch he asked for was w ater be cause, be fore going int o deep concentratio n, the topmost layer of thought in his mind wa s water an d by concentration, however deep and prolonged it might have been, he had only been able temp orarily to lull his thoughts. When h e regained consciousness this t opmost tho ught flew up with all the speed and force of a flo od breaking thro ugh the dykes. If this is the case with r egard to a th ought whi ch took shape immediatel y before he sat f or meditation, th ere is no doubt that thoughts which took root earlier wo uld als o remain unannihilated. If annihilatio n of th oughts is liber ation c an he be said to have attai ned salvation? Sadhakas [seek ers] rarely understand the difference between this tempor ary stilling of th e mind [ manol aya] and permanent d estruction of thoughts [manona sa]. In manol aya there is temp orary subsidence of thought-wa ves, and though this temporary period may even last for a th ousand years, thoughts, whi ch are thus temp orarily stilled, rise u p as soon as th e manolaya ceases. On e must therefore w atch o ne’s spiritu al progress c arefully. One must n ot allow o neself to be overtaken by such spells o f stillness o f thought. The moment one experiences this, on e must revive consciousness an d enquire withi n as to wh o it is who experiences this stillnes s. While not allo wing a ny thoughts to intru de, on e must not, at the s ame time, be overtaken by this deep sleep [yoga nidra] or self- hypn otism. Though this is a sign of progress towards the g oal, yet it is also the point wh ere th e divergence betw een the r oad to liberatio n and yoga nidr a takes pla ce. The e asy way, the direct way, the shortest cut t o salvation is th e enquiry method. By such enquiry, you will dri ve the thought force deeper till it reaches its source and merge s therein. It is the n that you will ha ve the res ponse fr om within a nd find that you rest there, de stroying all thoughts, on ce and for all. Q: This ‘I’-th ought rise s from me. But I do not know the Self. A: All th ese are only mental co ncepts. You are now identifying yourself with a wrong ‘I’, which is the ‘I’-th ought. This ‘I’-th ought rises a nd sinks, wh ereas the tr ue sig nifica nce of ‘I’ is beyond bo th. Ther e cannot be a break in your being. Yo u who slept are also now awake. Th ere is no unhappiness in your deep sleep whereas it exists no w. What is it that has happened now so th at this differ ence is ex perienced? There was n o ‘I’-th ought in your sleep, wh ereas it is present now. Th e true ‘I’ is not apparent and the fals e ‘I’ is parading itself. This f alse ‘I’ is the obstacle to your right knowledge. Find ou t from where this f alse ‘I’ arise s. Then it will dis appear. You will then be only what you are, that is, absolute b eing. Q: How to do it? I ha ve not succeeded so far. A: Search for th e source of the ‘I’-th ought. That is all that on e has to do . The universe ex ists on account of th e ‘I’-thought. If that ends there is an end to misery also. Th e false ‘I’ will end only when its source is so ught. Again pe ople often ask how the mind is co ntrolled. I say to them, ‘Show me th e mind a nd then you will know what to do.’ T he fact is that the mind is only a bundle of th oughts. Ho w can you exti nguish it by the thought of do ing so or by a desire? Your thoughts and desires ar e part an d parcel of the mind. Th e mind is simply fattened by new thoughts rising up. Therefor e it is foolish to attempt to kill the mind by means of the mind. Th e only way of doing it is to find its source and hold on to it. The mind will then fade away of its own accord. Yo ga teaches chitta vritti nirodha [control of the activitie s of the mind]. But I say atma vichara [self- investigati on]. This is the practical way. Chitta v ritti nirodha is brought about in sl eep, sw oon, or by starvation. As so on as the c ause is withdr awn there is a re crudescence of thoughts. Of what use is it then? In the state of stu por there is pe ace and no miser y. But miser y recurs wh en the stupor is removed. So nirodha [control] is useless an d cannot be of lasti ng benefit. How then can the benefit be made la sting? It is by finding the cause of misery. Misery is due to the perception of objects. If they are not there, there will be no contingent th oughts an d so misery is wiped off. ‘How will objects cease 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman to be?’ is the n ext question.

Since there is no duality, no thoughts will arise to di sturb your peace. This is realizatio n of the Self. The Self is eternal an d so al so is realiz ation. Abhyasa [spiritual pr actice] consists in with drawal within the Self ev ery time you ar e disturbed by thought. It is not concentration o r destruction of th e mind but with drawal into the Self. Q: Why is concentration ineffecti ve? A: To ask the mind to kill the mind is like maki ng the thief th e policeman. He will go with you and pretend to catch the thief, but nothing will be gained. So you must turn inw ard an d see from where the mind ris es and then it will cease to exist. Q: In turning the mind in wards, are we n ot still employing the mind ? A: Of course we are empl oying the mind. It is well known and admitted that o nly with t he hel p of th e mind can the mind be killed. But inst ead of setting about saying there is a mind, an d I wa nt to kill it, you begin to seek the s ource of the mind, an d you find the mind does not e xist at all. The mind, turned outwards, res ults in thoughts and objects. Turned inwards, it becomes itself th e Self. Q: Even so, I do not u nderstand. ‘I’, you say, is the wro ng ‘I’ no w. How to eliminat e the wro ng ‘I’ ? A: You need not eliminate the wr ong ‘I’. How ca n ‘I’ eliminate itself? All that you need do is to find ou t its origin an d abide there. Yo ur efforts can extend only thus far. Then the beyon d will tak e care of itself. You are helpless ther e. No effort can reach it. Q: If ‘I’ am alw ays, here and now, why do I not feel so? A: That is it. Who says it is not f elt? Does the real ‘I’ say it or the fals e ‘I’? Examine it. Yo u will fin d it is the wr ong ‘I’. The wro ng ‘I’ is the o bstruction. It has to be removed in or der th at the tru e ‘I’ may not be hidden. The feeli ng that I have not reali zed is th e obstruction to re alizatio n. In fact it is already realized and there is nothing more to be realized. Otherwis e, the realiz ation will be new. If it has not exist ed so far, it must take place hereafter. What is born will also die. If realizatio n is not eternal it is not wort h having. Therefore w hat we s eek is not that w hich must ha ppen afresh. It is only that which is eternal but n ot now known due to ob structions. It is that whi ch we s eek. All th at we need do is remo ve the o bstruction. That whi ch is eter nal is not known to b e so b ecause of ig norance. Ignorance is the obstruction. Get ov er the ignorance and all will be well. The ignorance is id entical with t he ‘I’-th ought. Find its source and it will va nish. The ‘I’-t hought is like a spirit which, although not p alpable, rises up simulta neously with the body, flourishes an d disappears with it. The b ody-consciousness is th e wrong ‘I’. Give up this bo dy-consciousness. It is done by seeking the source of t he ‘I’. The body does not say ‘I am’. It is you who say, ‘I am the b ody’. Find ou t who this ‘I’ is. Seeking its so urce it will vanish. Q: How lon g can the mind st ay or be kept in th e Heart? A: The period extends by practice. Q: What happens at th e end of th e peri od? A: The mind ret urns to th e present normal state. Unity in the He art is replaced by a variety of pe rceived phenomena. This is calle d the o utgoing mind. The He art-goi ng mind is ca lled th e restin g mind. When on e daily practise s more and more in this mann er, the mind will become extremely pure due to th e removal of its defects an d the practice will become so e asy that th e purified mind will plunge int o the He art as soon as the e nquiry is commenc ed.

A: Yes, it is possible, but he gradually loses the id entific ation in t he course of his pr actice. In the flo odlight of th e Self the darkness of illusio n dissi pates f or ever. Experience gained wit hout rooting out all th e vasanas cannot remain ste ady. Efforts must be made to e radicate th e vasanas; kn owledge can only remain unshaken after all th e vasanas are rooted out. We have to contend against age-long mental te ndencies. They will all go. O nly they go comp arativ ely soon in the case of those w ho have made s adhana in th e past an d later in the case of others. Q: Do these tendencies g o gradually or will th ey suddenly all disappear on e day? I ask this because alth ough I ha ve remain ed here for a long time I do not perceive any gradual c hange in me. A: When the s un rise s, does the darkness go gradually or all at once? Q: How can I tell if I am makin g progress with m y enquiry? A: The degree of t he absence of thoughts is the meas ure of your progress towards Self- realization. But Self- realizatio n itself does not a dmit of progress, it is ever th e same. The Self remains alw ays in realization. Th e obstacles are thoughts. Progress is meas ured by the degree of remo val of th e obstacles to understanding that th e Self is always realized. So th oughts must be c hecked by seeking to w hom they arise. So you go to their so urce, where they do not arise. Q: Doubts are alw ays arising. He nce my question. A: A doubt aris es and is cle ared. Another aris es and that is cle ared, making w ay for yet another; and so it goes on. So there is no possibility of clearing away all doubts. See to w hom the doubts arise. Go to their so urce and abide in it. Then they cease to arise. That is ho w doubts are to b e cleared. Q: Should I go on asking ‘Who am I?’ without answerin g? Who as ks wh om? Which b havana [attitude] should be in the mind at th e time of enquiry? What is ‘I’, the Self or the ego? A: In the e nquiry ‘Who am I?’, ‘I’ is th e ego. The question really means, wh at is the source or origin of this eg o? You need not have any bhavana [attitude] in the mind. All that is required is that you must give up the bhavana that you are the body, of such and such a de scription, with s uch and such a n ame, etc. There is no need to have a bhavana about your real nature. It exists as it always does. It is real an d no bhavana. Q: But is it not funny that th e ‘I’ should be searching for the ‘I’? Does not the e nquiry ‘Who am I?’ turn ou t in the e nd to be an empty formula ? Or, am I to put the question to myself endlessly, repeating it like s ome mantra? A: Self-e nquiry is certainly not an empty formula and it is more th an the repetition of any mantr a. If the enquiry ‘Who am I?’ were a mere ment al questioning, it would not b e of muc h value. The v ery purpose of self-e nquiry is to f ocus the e ntire mind at its source. It is not, therefore, a case of one ‘I’ searching f or another ‘I’. Muc h less is self-e nquiry an empty formula, for it involves an intense activity of the entir e mind to ke ep it steadily poised in pu re Self-aw areness. Q: Is it enough if I spend some time in the morni ngs and some time in the e venings for this atma-vi chara? Or should I do it alw ays, even when I am writin g or walking? A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, wal king o r being? The one unalterable reality is bei ng. Until you realize t hat state o f pure being you should pursue the enquiry. If once you ar e establishe d in it there will be no further wo rry. No one will en quire into th e source of thoughts unl ess th oughts aris e. So long as you think ‘I am walking’ or ‘I am writing’, en quire wh o does it. Q: If I go on rejecting thoughts ca n I call it vichara? A: It may be a ste pping sto ne. But re ally vichara begins when you clin g to your Self and are alr eady off the mental moveme nt, the thought waves. 40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Q: Then vichara is not int ellectual? A: No, it is antara vi chara, in ner qu est. Holding the mind an d investig ating it is advised for a be ginner. But what is mind after all ? It is a pr ojection of th e Self. See f or whom it appears and from where it rises. Th e ‘I’-thought will be found to b e the root-cause. Go de eper. The ‘I’-t hought disappears an d there is an infinitely expanded ‘I’-co nsciousness. Q: I asked Mother in Sri Aurobindo As hram the foll owing question: I keep my mind bl ank witho ut thoughts arisin g so that God might show h imself in his true being. But I do not perceive anything.’ The r eply was to this eff ect: ‘The attitud e is right. The p ower will come d own from above. It is a direct experience.’ Should I do anything f urther ? A: Be what you are. Th ere is not hing to come do wn or become manife st. All that is ne cessary is to lose th e ego. That which is is always there. Even now you are that. You are not a part from it. The blank is se en by you. You are th ere to see the blank. What do you wait for ? The thought, ‘I have not seen’, the expectation to se e and the desire of getti ng somethi ng, ar e all the wor kings of th e ego. You have fallen int o snares of th e ego. The ego says all th ese and not you. Be yourself an d nothing more! Once born you reach somet hing. If you reach it you return al so. Ther efore leave off all this ve rbiage. Be as you are. See wh o you are and remain a s the Self, free from birth, goi ng, comin g and returning. Q: How is one to know th e Self? A: Knowing the Self means being the Self. Can you say that you do not know the Self? Though you cannot see your own eyes and though not provided wit h a mirror to lo ok in, do you deny the existence of your eyes? Similarly , you are aware of th e Self even though the Self is no t objectified. Or, do you deny your Self be cause it is not o bjectified? When you say ‘I cannot know the Self, it means absence in terms of relative knowledge, because you have been so accustomed to rel ative k nowledge that you ide ntify yourself with it. Such wro ng identity has for ged the diffi culty of not knowing the obvious Self be cause it ca nnot be objectified. And then you ask ‘how is one to kn ow th e Self? ’ Q: You talk o f being. Bein g what? A: Your duty is to be and not to be this or th at. ‘I am that I am’ sums up the wh ole trut h. The metho d is summed up in the words ‘Be still’. What do es stilln ess mean ? It means destroy yourself. Because any form or sh ape is the cause of trouble. Giv e up the notion th at ‘I am so a nd so’. All th at is required to realize th e Self is to be still. What ca n be easier tha n that ? Hence atma-vi dya [Self- knowledge] is the easiest to attain. The tr uth of on eself alone is wort hy to be scrutinise d and known. Taking it as the tar get of on e’s attentio n, one should keenly know it in the H eart. This knowledge of on eself will be revealed only to the consciousness which is silent, clear and free from the activity of the a gitated and suff ering mind. Know th at the consciousness whi ch always shines in the Heart as t he formless Self, ‘I’, an d whi ch is kn own by one’s being still witho ut thinking a bout anything a s existent or n on- existent, alone is the p erfect reality. 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Chapter 6 - Self-enquiry — misconceptions Sri Rama na’s ph ilosophical pr onouncements wer e very similar to those upheld by the follow ers of ad vaita vedanta, an Indian p hilosophical school whi ch has flourished for w ell over a thousand years. Sri Ramana a nd the advaitins ag ree on most th eoretical matters but th eir attitudes to pr actice a re radically different. While Sri Raman a advocated self- enquiry, most a dvaitic tea chers recommende d a system of meditati on whi ch ment ally affirmed that th e Self was the only reality. These affirmation s such as ‘I am Brahman’ o r ‘I am he ’, are usually used as mantra s, or, more rar ely, one meditate s on their meani ng and tries t o experience the implicatio ns of th e statement. Because self-e nquiry often st arts with the question ‘Who am I?’, many of the traditio nal follow ers of ad vaita ass umed that th e answer to th e question was ‘I am Brahman’ a nd they occupied their minds with re petition s of this mental solution. Sri Rama na criticis ed this ap proach by saying that while t he mind was c onstantly engaged in finding or repeating sol utions to the q uestion it would never sink int o its source and disappear. He was e qually critic al, for th e same re ason, of those wh o tried to u se ‘Who am I?’ as a mantra, saying that bo th approaches misse d the p oint of s elf- enquiry. The question ‘Who am I?’, he said, is not an invitatio n to analyse the mind an d to come to co nclusions about its nature, nor is it a mantric formula, it is simply a tool which facilitate s redirecting attentio n from the objects of thought an d perception to the thi nker and perceiver of th em. In Sri Rama na’s o pinion, the s olutio n to the q uestion ‘Who am I? ’ is no t to be found in or by the mind since the only real answer is the e xperience of the a bsence of mind. Another widespread misun derstanding arose from the Hindu belief that th e Self c ould be d iscovered by mentally rejecting all th e objects of t hought and perception as not-Self. Traditio nally this is ca lled th e neti-n eti approach (not this, not this). Th e practition er of this system verbally rejects all the objects that the ‘I’ ide ntifies with - ‘I am no t the mind’, ‘I am not t he body’, etc. - in the expectation that th e real ‘I’ will eventually be experienced in its pu re uncontaminat ed form. Hinduism calls this pr actice ‘self-en quiry’ and, because of the id entity of names, it was ofte n confused with Sri Raman a’s metho d. Sri Ramana’s attitude to this traditio nal system of self- analysis was wholly negative and he discouraged his own follow ers from practisi ng it by tellin g them that it was an intellect ual acti vity which could not take them beyond th e mind. In his sta ndard re ply to qu estions about the e ffectiveness of t his practice he would say that th e ‘I’-tho ught is sustained by such acts of d iscriminatio n and that th e ‘I’ which eliminates the b ody and the mind as ‘not I’ can never eliminate itself. The follower s of the ‘I am Brahman’ and ‘neti-n eti’ schools s hare a common be lief that th e Self can be discovered by the mind, eith er thro ugh affirmation o r negation. This belief t hat the mind ca n, by its own activities, rea ch the Self is the root of most of th e misconceptions about the p ractice of self-e nquiry. A classic ex ample o f this is the beli ef that self-enquiry involves concentratin g on a particular ce ntre in the body called the Heart-c entre. This widely-held view results from a misinter pretatio n of some o f Sri Ramana’s statements o n the Heart, an d to un derstand how this b elief has come ab out it will be necessary to take a cl oser lo ok at s ome of his ideas on the subject. In describing the ori gin of th e ‘I’-tho ught he sometimes said that it rose to t he brain thr ough a ch annel which started from a centre in th e right-hand side of the c hest. He called this ce ntre th e Heart-c entre and said that wh en the ‘I’-thought su bsided int o the Self it went back int o the c entre and disappeared. He als o said that wh en the Self is consciously experienced, there is a ta ngible aw areness th at this centre is the s ource of b oth th e mind an d the w orld. However, these statements a re not strictly true and Sri Ramana s ometimes qualified them by saying that th ey were only schematic re presentations w hich were gi ven to tho se people who persisted i n identifying with their bo dies. He said that the H eart is not r eally located in the b ody and that from the highest sta ndpoint it is equally untrue to say that the ‘I’-t hought arises an d subsides int o this ce ntre on the rig ht of th e chest. Because Sri Rama na oft en sai d ‘Find the pl ace where the ‘I’ aris es’ or ‘Find th e source of the mind’, many people interpreted these stateme nts to mean th at they should concentrate o n this pa rticular centre while d oing self-e nquiry. Sri Rama na rejected this interpr etation many times by saying that the source of the mind o r the ‘I’ co uld only be 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman discovered through atte ntion t o the ‘I’- tho ught and not through concentratio n on a particular p art of th e body. He did sometimes say that putti ng atte ntion on this c entre is a good concentratio n practice, bu t he never ass ociated it with self- en quiry. He als o occasionally said that meditatio n on the He art was an effective w ay of reaching the Self, but again, he never said th at this s hould be done by concentratin g on the He art-ce ntre. Inst ead he said that on e should meditate o n the Heart ‘as it is’. The Heart ‘as it is’ is not a location, it is the immane nt Self an d one can only be aware of its real na ture by being it. It cannot be reached by concentratio n. Although there ar e several po tentially ambig uous comments of this ki nd about the H eart an d the Heart-c entre, in all his writin gs and recorded conversations ther e is not a si ngle st atement to su pport the contention that self-e nquiry is to be practised by concentrating on this c entre. In fact, by closely examinin g his stateme nts on the subject one can only conclude that whil e the experience of the Self contains an awareness of this ce ntre, co ncentration o n this c entre will not result in th e experience of th e Self. Q: I begin to ask myself ‘Who am I?’ eliminate the b ody as not ‘I’, the breath a s not ‘I’, an d I am not abl e to pr oceed further. A: Well, that is as far as th e intellect c an go. Your process is only intellect ual. Indeed, all the scriptures menti on the process only to gu ide the seeker to know th e truth. The trut h cannot be directly pointed o ut. Hence this int ellectual process. You see, the one who eliminates all th e ‘not I’ ca nnot eliminate th e ‘I’. To say ‘I am no t this’ or ‘I am that’ there must be the ‘I’. This ‘I’ is on ly the ego or th e ‘I’-thought. After the risin g up of this ‘I’-thought, all ot her th oughts aris e. The ‘I’-thought is therefore t he root-tho ught. If the root is pu lled o ut all oth ers are at the same time uprooted. Therefore seek the root ‘I’, qu estion yourself ‘Who am I?’. Find out its so urce, and then all these other ideas will va nish and the pure Self will remain. Q: How to do it? A: The ‘I’ is always there – in de ep sleep, in dream and in w akefulness. The o ne in sleep is the same as t hat wh o now speaks. There is always the feeling of ‘I’. Otherwis e do you deny your existence? You do not. Yo u say ‘I am’. Find ou t who is. Q: I meditate n eti-neti [not this – no t this]. A: No – th at is not meditatio n. Find the source. You must re ach the source with out fail. The fals e ‘I’ will disappear and the real ‘I’ will be realized. Th e former cannot exist ap art from the latter. There is now wrong identificatio n of th e Self with th e body, senses, etc. Yo u proceed to di scard these, an d this is neti. This ca n be done only by holding to th e one which cannot be discarded. That is iti [that which is]. Q: When I thin k ‘Who am I? ’, the answer come s I am not this mortal bo dy but I am chaitanya, atma [cons ciousness, the Self].’ And suddenly another question aris es, ‘Wh y has atma come i nto ma ya [illusion]?’ o r in other wor ds, ‘Why has God created this world?’ A: To enquire ‘Who am I? ’ really means trying to fin d out the source of th e ego or the ‘I’- th ought. Yo u are n ot to think of ot her th oughts, su ch as ‘I am not t his body’. Seeking the source of ‘I’ ser ves as a means of getting rid of all other th oughts. We should not give scope to ot her th oughts, su ch as you mention, bu t must keep the att ention fixe d on finding o ut the s ource of t he ‘I’-th ought by asking, as e ach thought arise s, to whom the thought aris es. If the answer is ‘I get the thought’ continue the e nquiry by asking ‘Who is this ‘I’ an d what is its source?’ Q: Am I to k eep on repeating ‘Who am I? ’ so as to make a mantra of it? A: No. ‘Who am I? ’ is no t a mantra. It mea ns that you must fin d out wh ere in you arise s the ‘I’- tho ught which is the source of all oth er tho ughts. Q: Shall I meditate on ‘I am Bra hman’ [aham Brahmasmi]? 43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman A: The text is not meant for thi nking ‘I am Brahman’. Ah am [‘I’] is known to every one. Brahman abi des as aham in every one. Find ou t the ‘I’. The ‘I’ is already Brahman. Yo u need not think so. Simpl y find out the ‘I’. Q: Is not discarding of th e ???e? [neti-n eti] mentioned in th e sastr as? A: After the ris e of the ‘I’-th ought th ere is the f alse ide ntificatio n of th e ‘I’ wit h the body, the senses, the mind, etc. ‘I’ is wrongly associated with them an d the tr ue ‘I’ is lost sight of. In o rder to sift th e pure ‘I’ from the contaminate d ‘I’, this dis carding is mentio ned. But it does not mean e xactly discarding o f the non-Self, it means the finding of th e real Self. The real Self is the infinit e ‘I’. Th at ‘I’ is pe rfection. It is eternal. It has no origin an d no end. The o ther ‘I’ is born and also dies. It is impermane nt. See to whom the c hanging thoughts b elong. Th ey will be found to aris e after th e ‘I’-thought. Hold th e ‘I’-tho ught and they subside. Trace back the s ource of t he ‘I’-th ought. The Self al one will remain. Q: It is difficult to foll ow. I understand the theory. But wh at is the practice? A: The other meth ods ar e meant for th ose w ho cannot ta ke to th e investigation of t he Self. Even to r epeat aham Brahmasmi or think of it, a doer is necessary. Who is it? It is ‘I’. Be th at ‘I’. It is the dire ct method. Th e other methods also will ultimately lead everyone to this meth od of th e investigation of t he Self. Q: I am aware of the ‘I’. Yet m y troubles ar e not ended. A: This ‘I’-tho ught is not pure. It is contaminate d with the association o f the body and senses. See to wh om the tro uble is. It is to th e ‘I’-thought. Hold it. Then the other tho ughts va nish. Q: Yes. How to do it? That is the w hole tr ouble. A: Think ‘I, I’, and hold to that o ne thought to the exclusion o f all others. Q: Is not affirmation of G od more eff ective than the q uest, ‘Who am I?’ Affirmation is positive, whereas the other is negation. More over, it indi cates separateness. A: So long as you seek to know how to re alize, this ad vice is given to fin d your Self. Your seeking the method denotes your separateness. Q: Is it not better to say I am th e supreme being’ th an ask ‘Who am I? ’ A: Who a ffirms? Th ere must be o ne to do it. Find that on e. Q: Is not meditation b etter th an investigation? A: Meditatio n implies ment al imagery, whereas inv estigation is for th e reality. The former is objective, wh ereas the latter is su bjective. Q: There must be a scientific approach to this subject. A: To eschew unreality and seek the reality is scientific. Q: I mean th ere must be a gradual elimination, first of the mind, the n of th e intellect, then of th e ego. A: The Self alo ne is re al. All others are u nreal. The mind an d intellect do not remain a part from you. The Bi ble says, ‘Be still an d know that I am Go d.’ Stillness is the sol e requisite for th e realization o f the Self as God. Q: Is soham [the affirmatio n I am ‘h e’] the same as ‘Who am I?’ A: Aham [‘I’ ] alone is common to th em. One is soham. The ot her is ko ham ‘Who am I? ’. They are different. Why should we go on saying soham? One must find out the r eal ‘I’. In the question ‘Who am I? ’, ‘I’ refer s to the ego. Trying to trac e it and find its source, we s ee it has no separate ex istence but merges i n the real ‘I’. You see the diffic ulty. Vichara is diff erent in meth od from the meditati on siv oham or soham [‘I am Siva’ o r ‘I am 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman he’]. I rather lay stress up on Self-knowledge, for you ar e first co ncerned with yourself b efore you proceed to know the world and its Lord. The s oham meditatio n or ‘I am Bra hman’ meditatio n is more or less a ment al thought. But th e quest for th e Self I speak of is a dir ect metho d, indeed superior to th e other meditation. Th e moment you start looking for the self an d go deeper and deeper, the real Self is waitin g ther e to take you in. The n whatever is done is do ne by somethi ng els e and you have no hand in it. In this pr ocess, all doubts an d discussions are a utomatic ally given up just as one who sleeps forgets, for the time being, all his cares. Q: What certainty is ther e that somet hing el se waits th ere to wel come me? A: When one is a sufficiently developed soul [pakvi] one becomes naturally convinced. Q: How is this development po ssible? A: Various answers are given. But whatever the previous de velopment, vichara quickens the d evelopment. Q: That is arguing in a circle. I am de veloped and so I am suitabl e for the q uest but the quest itself causes me to develop. A: The mind ha s always this s ort of diffic ulty. It wants a ce rtain th eory to satisfy itself. Really, no theory is necessary for the man who seriously desires to approach God or to reali ze his ow n true being. Q: No doubt the method taught by Bhagavan is direct. But it is so difficult. We do not know how to begin it. If we g o on asking, ‘Who am I?’, ‘Who am I?’ like a japa [repetition o f the nam e of God] or a mantra, it becomes du ll. In other metho ds ther e is somethin g preliminar y and positive with w hich one can begin and then go step by step. But in Bhagavan’s metho d, there is no such thing, an d to seek the Self at once, though dir ect, is diffi cult. A: You yourself c oncede it is the dire ct method. It is the dir ect an d easy meth od. When goi ng after oth er thin gs that are alien to u s is so easy, how can it be diffic ult for one to go to on e’s ow n Self? You talk o f ‘Wher e to begin?’ There is no beginning and no end. You are yourself in th e beginning and the end. If you are here and the Self some where else, and you have to reach that Self, you ma y be told ho w to start, how to travel and then how to reach. Sup pose you who are n ow in R amanasr amam ask, ‘I want to go to Raman asramam. How shall I start an d how to re ach it?’, wh at is one to say? A man’ s search for t he Self is like that. He is always the Self an d nothing els e. You say ‘Who am I?’ becomes a japa. It is not mea nt that you should go on asking ‘Who am I? ’ In that ca se, tho ught will no t so easily die. In the direct meth od, as you call it, in asking yourself ‘Who am I?’, you are tol d to co ncentrate within yourself wh ere the ‘I’-t hought, the root of all ot her th oughts, aris es. As the Self is not outside but insi de you, you are asked to div e within, inst ead of going with out. What can be more ea sy than going to yourself? But th e fact remain s that to some this metho d will seem difficult an d will not appeal. That is why so many different methods have been taught. Eac h of th em will appeal to s ome as the b est an d easiest. That is ac cording to their pa kva or fitness. But to some, no thing except the vichara marga [the path of enquiry] will appeal. They will ask, ‘Yo u want me to kn ow or to se e this or that. But wh o is the knower, the s eer?’ Whate ver ot her meth od may be chosen, there will be always a doer. Th at cannot be escaped. One must find out who the doer is. Till then, the sadhana cannot be ended. So ev entually, all must come to fin d out ‘Who am I? ’ You com plain th at there is nothing preliminary or positive to start with. You have the ‘I’ to st art with. You know you exist alw ays, whereas the b ody does not exist always, for example in sle ep. Sleep r eveals that you exist even without a body. We identify the ‘I’ with a body, we regard th e Self as having a body, and as having limits, and hence all ou r trouble.

But I know of n o other wo rk which ref ers to it as being located ther e. Q: Can I be sure th at the ancients meant this ce ntre by the term ‘Heart’? A: Yes, that is so. But you should try to have rather tha n to lo cate th e experience. A man need not find out wh ere his eyes are situat ed wh en he wants to se e. The He art is there ev er open to you if you care to en ter it, ever supportin g all your movements ev en when you are unaware. It is pe rhaps more pr oper to say that th e Self is the H eart itself tha n to say that it is in th e Heart. Really, the Self is the centre itself. It is everywhere, aw are of itself as ‘Heart’, th e Self- awareness. Q: In that ca se, how can it be localised i n any part of t he body? Fixin g a place for th e Heart would imply setting physiolo gical limitations to that whi ch is beyon d space and time. A: That is right. But th e person who puts the question about the position of th e Heart considers himself as existing with or in th e body. While putting the q uestion n ow, wo uld you say that your bo dy alone is he re but you are s peaking from somewh ere els e? No, you accept your bodily existence. It is from this po int of vi ew that any reference to a physical bo dy comes to b e made. Truly speaking, pure consciousness is indivisible, it is with out pa rts. It has no form and shape, no ‘within’ an d ‘without’. There is no ‘right’ or ‘left’ for it. Pure co nsciousness, whi ch is the H eart, includes all, and nothing is outside o r apart from it. That is the ultimate truth. From this ab solute sta ndpoint, the Heart, Self or consciousness ca n have no particular pla ce assigned to it in the physical bo dy. What is the reason? The body is itself a mere pr ojection of t he mind, and the mind is bu t a poor reflection o f the radiant Heart. How c an that, in which everything is contained, be itself co nfined as a tiny part within the physical body which is bu t an infinitesimal, phenomenal manifestati on of th e one reality?

Q: Should I meditate o n the right ch est in o rder to meditate on the He art? A: The He art is not physical. Meditatio n should not be on the rig ht or the left. Meditatio n should be on the Self. Everyone k nows ‘I am’. Who is the ‘I’? It will be neither within n or with out, neit her on the rig ht nor on the left. ‘I am’ - that is all. Lea ve alone the idea of rig ht and left. They pertain to the b ody. The H eart is the Self. Realize it and then you will see for yourself. Th ere is no need to kn ow where and what the He art is.

Sri Raman a accepted t he vali dity of such an approach and often said th at this meth od was as eff ective as self-e nquiry. Traditio nally the path of s urrender is associated with dualistic de votional practices, bu t such activities were only of secondary importa nce to Sri Raman a. Instead he stressed that true s urrender transcended wo rshipping God in a su bject – object relati onship sin ce it could only be successfully accomplishe d when the one who imagine d that h e was s eparate fr om God had ceased to ex ist. To achieve this g oal he recommend ed two di stinct pr actices: 1 Hol ding on to the ‘I’-th ought un til the one who imagine s that he is separate fr om God disa ppears. 2 Compl etely surrendering all res ponsibility for one’s life to God or the Self. For such self-s urrender to be effective one must have no will or desire of on e’ ow n and one must be complet ely free of the id ea that there is an individual person who is capable of acting independently of God. The first metho d is clearly self-en quiry masq uerading un der a differ ent nam e. Sri Ramana o ften e quated the practices of surrender a nd enquiry either by saying that th ey were differ ent nam es for the s ame process o r that th ey were the only two eff ective means by which Self-re alizatio n could be achieved. This is quite consistent with hi s view th at any practice which involved aw areness o f the ‘I’-th ought wa s a valid and direct route to the Self, whereas all pr actices which didn’t wer e not. This insist ence on the subjective awareness of ‘I’ as the only means of r eaching the Self col oured his attitude t owards practices of devotion [bha kti) and worship whi ch are usually associated with surr ender to G od. He n ever discouraged his de votees from followin g such practices, but he pointed out that any relationship with Go d (devotee, wors hipper, servant, etc.) was an illusory one since God alone exists. True devotion, he said, is to remain a s one really is, in th e state o f being in whi ch all id eas about relatio nships with Go d have ceased to exist. The second method, of surrendering responsibilit y for on e’s life to G od, is also related to self- en quiry since it aims to eliminate th e ‘I’-thought by separatin g it from the objects and actions that it constantly identifies with. In f ollowin g this pr actice there should be a co nstant aw areness t hat ther e is no individual ‘I’ wh o arts or d esires, that only the Self exists and that th ere is not hing apart from the Self th at is capable of acting independently of it. When followi ng this practice, whenever on e becomes aware that on e is as suming re sponsibility for thoughts and actions – for example, ‘I want’ or ‘I am do ing this’ — one should try to withdraw the mind from its external co ntacts an d fix it in the Self. This is analogous to the tra nsfer o f attention whi ch takes pl ace in self-en quiry when one realises that self-att ention has been lost. In bo th cases the aim is to isol ate the ‘I’-th ought and mak e it disappear in its source. Sri Rama na himself admitted th at spontaneous and complete s urrender of the ‘I’ by this metho d was a n impossi ble goal for many people and so he sometimes advised his follo wers to un dertake preliminar y exercises whi ch wo uld cultivate th eir devotion and control their minds. Most of these practice s involved thin king of or meditatin g on God or the Guru eit her by constantly repeating hi s name (j apa) or by visualisin g his form. He told his d evotees that if this was done regularly with l ove and devotion then the mind w ould become eff ortlessly absorbed in th e object of meditatio n. Once this h as been achieved complete s urrender becomes muc h easier. The constant aw areness o f God prevents the mind from identifying with other objects and enhances the conviction th at God alone exi sts. It also produces a reciprocal flow o f power or gr ace from the Self w hich w eakens the h old of the ‘I’-th ought an d destroys the vasanas which perpetuate and reinforce its existence. Eventually the ‘I’-th ought is re duced to manageable pr oportions and with a little self-atte ntion it can be mad e to sin k tempor arily into th e Heart. As with self-e nquiry, final realization is br ought ab out automatically by the power of the Self. When all the o utgoing tendencies of the mind ha ve been dissolved in the repeated e xperiences of being, th e Self 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman destroys the vestigial ‘I’-th ought so complet ely that it never ris es again. This final d estruction of the ‘I’ ta kes pl ace only if the self-s urrender has been com pletely motiv eless. If it is done with a desire for gr ace or Self-realiz ation it can never be more th an partial surr ender, a bu siness tran saction in whi ch the ‘I’-tho ught makes a n effort in the expectation of receiving a reward. Q: What is unconditional surr ender? A: If one surrenders on eself there will be no one to ask questions or to be thought of. Either the thoughts ar e eliminate d by holding on to th e root-thought ‘I’, or on e surrenders oneself uncondition ally to the higher po wer. Th ese are the only two w ays for realization. Q: Does not total or com plete su rrender r equire that on e should no t have left ev en the desire for liberatio n or Go d? A: Complete s urrender does require th at you ha ve no desire of your ow n. You must be satisfie d with whatever God gives you and that means h aving no desires o f your ow n. Q: Now that I am satisfied o n that point, I wa nt to know what the ste ps are by which I co uld achieve surr ender. A: There are two w ays. One is loo king into th e source of ‘I’ and merging int o that so urce. The other is feeli ng ‘I am helpless by myself, God alone is all-po werful an d except by throwi ng myself completely on him, there is no other means of safety for me.’ By this method one gradually develops the conviction that Go d alone exists an d that the ego does not count. Bot h methods lead to the same g oal. Complet e surrender is another name for jn ana or liber ation. Q: I find surrender is easier. I want to adopt th at path. A: By whatever pat h you go, you will have to los e yourself in the one. Surre nder is complete o nly when you re ach the stage ‘Th ou art all’ an d ‘Thy will be done’. The st ate is not diff erent from jnana. In s oham [the affirmation of ‘I am he’] there is dv aita [dualism]. In surrender there is advaita [no n-dualism] . In the reality there is neit her dv aita nor advaita, but that which is. Surre nder appears easy because people imagine th at, once they say with their lips ‘I surr ender’ a nd put their burdens on their Lord, th ey can be free and do what they like. But th e fart is that you ca n have no likes or dislik es after your surrender; your will should be come complet ely non- existent, the L ord’s will taking its place. The death of the e go in this way brings about a st ate whic h is not diff erent from jnana. So by whatever path you may go, you must come to j nana or on eness. Q: What is the best way of killing th e ego? A: To each person that way is the best whi ch appears easiest or appeals most. All the ways are equally good, as th ey lead to the s ame goal, which is th e merging of the e go in the Self. What the b hakta [dev otee] calls surr ender, the man who does vichara calls j nana. Both ar e trying only to tak e the e go back to th e source from which it sprang and make it merge th ere. Q: Cannot grace hasten such com petence in a seeker? A: Leave it to God. Surre nder unreservedly. One of two t hings must be done. Either s urrender because you admit your inability and require a higher po wer to h elp you, or investigat e the cause of misery by going to the source and mergin g into th e Self. Either w ay you will be free from misery. God never forsakes one who has surrendered. Q: What is the drift of th e mind a fter surr ender? A: Is the surrendered mind raisi ng the question? Q: By constantly desiring to s urrender I hope that in creasing grace is ex perienced. A: Surrender once for all an d be done with the desire. So lon g as th e sense of d oership is retained ther e is the desire. That is als o personality. If this goes the Self is found to shine forth p ure. 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman The sense of do ership is th e bondage and not th e actions th emselve s. ‘Be still and know that I am God.’ He re stillness is tot al surrender without a vestige of in dividuality.

There ‘k nowing’ mea ns ‘being’. It is not the relative knowledge involving the tria ds, knowledge, knowing and known. Q: Is the thought ‘I am Go d’ or ‘I am th e supreme bei ng’ helpful? A: ‘I am that I am.’ ‘I am’ is God, no t thinking ‘I am God.’ Re alize ‘I am’ and do not thin k ‘I am.’ ‘Kn ow I am God,’ it is sai d, and not ‘Thi nk I am God.’ All talk of s urrender is like pinching brown s ugar from a brown sugar image o f Lord Ganesa and offering it as naivedya [food offering] to the same Lor d Ganesa. Yo u say you offer your body, soul and all po ssessions to Go d. Were th ey yours that you could offer th em? At be st, you ca n only say, ‘I falsely imagin ed till now that all th ese whi ch are yours were mine. Now I re alize th ey are yours. I shall no more act a s if they are mine.’ This kn owledge that there is no thing bu t God or Self, that I and mine do n’t exist an d that o nly the Self exists, is jnana. Thus there is no difference between bhakti and jnana. Bhakti is jnana mata or th e mother of jn ana.

Q: We surrender; but still there is no help. A: Yes. If you ha ve surrendered, you must b e able to abi de by the will of G od and not make a grievance of what may not please you. Things may turn out diff erently from the way they look apparently. Distre ss ofte n leads men to faith in God. Q: But w e are wo rldly. There is the wife, th ere ar e the children, friends and relati ves. We cannot ign ore th eir existence and resign ourselves to divi ne will, without ret aining some little of the personality in us. A: That mean s you ha ve not surr endered as professed by you. You must on ly trust God. Surrender to him and abide by his will wh ether he appears or vanishes. Await his pl easure. If you as k him to do as you please, it is not surr ender bu t comman d to him. You cannot have him obey you and yet think that you have surrendered. He kn ows what is best and when and how to do it. Leave everything en tirely to him. His is th e burden, you have no longer any cares. All your cares are his. Suc h is surrender. This is bh akti. Or, enquire to whom the se questions aris e. Dive deep in the H eart an d remain a s the Self. One of these two ways is open to the aspirant. Q: Surre nder is impossible. A: Yes. Complet e surrender is impossible in t he beginning. Partial su rrender is ce rtainly possible f or all. In course of time that will lea d to compl ete surr ender. Well, if surr ender is impossi ble, what ca n be done? There is no peace of mind. You are helpless to brin g it about. It can be done only by surrender. Q: Is surrender, by itself, sufficie nt to reach the Self? A: It is en ough that on e surrenders oneself. Surre nder is to g ive oneself up to the o riginal cause of o ne’s being. Do n ot delude yourself by imagini ng such a source to be some God outside you. Your source is withi n yourself. Give yourself up to it. That means t hat you should seek the source and merg e in it. Q: [Given to Sri Ratnana in the form of a written n ote.] They say that o ne can obtain ev erything if one takes refuge in God wholly and solely, and with out th ought of anything el se. Do es it mean sitting still in on e place and contemplati ng God entir ely at all times, discarding all th oughts, incl uding even thoughts ab out food, which is es sential for the sustenance of th e body? Do es it mean that wh en one gets ill, one should no t think of medici ne and treatment, but 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman entrust on e’s health or sickness exclusively to providence? In the Bhagavad Gita it says: ‘The man w ho sheds all longing and moves wit hout concern, free from the s ense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, he attains pe ace’ (2:71). It means the discarding of all de sires. Therefore should we devote ourselves exclusively to the c ontemplation o f God, and accept food and water o nly if they are available by God’s grace, without asking for th em? Or does it mean that we s hould mak e a little eff ort? Bhagavan, please explain th e secret of this sar anagati [surre nder]. A: [After rea ding the n ote Sri Ramana a ddressed everyone in th e room.] Ananya saranagati [complete surr ender] means to be with out any attachment to thoughts, no doubt, but does it mean to d iscard ev en thoughts of food and water which are essential for the s ustenance of the physical bo dy? H e asks, ‘Should I eat only if I get anything by God’s dir ection, and without my asking for it? Or should I mak e a little effort?’ All right. Let us take it that what we have to eat come s of its own accord. But ev en then, who is to e at? Suppose some body puts it in our mout h, should we not swallow it at least ? Is that not a n effort? He asks, ‘If I become sic k, should I tak e medicin e or sh ould I keep quiet leaving my health and sickness in the hands of G od?’ In the b ook Sad hana Pan chakam written by Sankara, it is stated that for treatment of th e disease called h unger one should eat food received as alms. But th en one must at least go out and beg for it. If all pe ople clos e their eyes and sit still saying if the food comes we eat, ho w is the w orld to ge t on? Hence one must ta ke thi ngs as they come in ac cordance with on e’s tra ditions, bu t one must be free from the feeli ng that one is doing them on eself. The feeling that I am doing it is the bondage. It is therefore necessary to consider and find o ut the method whereby such a feeling c an be overcome, instead of d oubting as to w hether medici ne should be administere d if one is sick or w hether food should be taken if one is hungry. Such doubts will co ntinue to com e up and will ne ver end. Even such doubts as ‘May I groan if there is pai n? May I inhale air aft er exhaling?’ also occur. Call it Iswara [God] or call it karma [destiny]; some ka rta [high er power] will carry on everything in this world a ccording to th e development of the mind of e ach indi vidual. If the responsibility is thrown on the higher po wer thi ngs will go on of their ow n accord. We walk on this gr ound. While doing so, do we consider at ev ery step whether we sh ould raise one leg aft er the other or st op at some sta ge? Isn’t th e walking do ne automatically? The s ame is the case with inh aling and exhaling. No special effort is made to in hale o r exhale. The same is the case with this life als o. Can we gi ve up anything if we w ant to, or do anything as we please? Quite a number of thi ngs ar e done automaticall y without ou r being conscious of it. Complet e surrender to Go d means gi ving up all thoughts a nd concentrating the mind o n him. If we c an concentrate on him, other th oughts dis appear. If the actions of th e mind, speech and body are merg ed with Go d, all the burdens of our life will be on him. Q: But is Go d really the doer of all the acti ons I pe rform ? A: The present diffic ulty is that man thin ks he is the doer. But it is a mistake. It is the higher power whi ch does everything and man is only a tool. If he a ccepts th at position he is free from troubles, ot herwis e he courts th em. Take, for inst ance, the s culpted fig ure at th e base of a g opuram [temple tower], which is mad e to appear as if it is be aring the burden of th e tower on its sh oulder. Its posture and look are a pi cture of great strain w hich g ives the impressi on that it is bearing the wei ght of th e tower. But thin k.

Hence love means one has love tow ards o ne’s own Self. Q: That is why I am asking you whether Go d could be wor shipped thro ugh the p ath of love. 52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman A: That is ex actly what I ha ve been saying. Love itself is th e actual form of God. If by saying, ‘I do not love this, I do not love that’, you re ject all things, th at which remains is swar upa, that is the real form of the Self. That is pure bliss. Call it pure blis s, God, atma, or what you will. That is de votion, th at is realizatio n and that is everything. If you th us reject everything, wh at remains is the Self alo ne. That is re al love. On e who knows the secret of th at love finds the wo rld itself full of universal lov e. The e xperience of not f orgetting co nsciousness alone is the state of d evotion [bhakti] which is th e relationship of unfading r eal lov e, because the real kn owledge of Self, whic h shines as the undivided supreme bliss itself, sur ges up as the nature of l ove. Only if one knows the truth of lo ve, whi ch is the r eal nat ure of Self, will the strong entangled knot of life be u ntied. Only if one attains th e height of lo ve will liberati on be attain ed.

The mind th en becomes one with the o bject of meditatio n, and this makes it quite pure. Then thin k who is the wor shipper. Th e answer is ‘I’, that is, the Self. In this w ay the Self is ultimately gained. Worship ping t he formless re ality by unthought thought is th e best kind of worship. But wh en one is no t fit for s uch formless wo rship of God, worship of form alone is suita ble. Formless worship is po ssible o nly for people who are devoid of th e ego-form. Know that all the wo rship done by people who possess the ego-form is only worship o f form. The p ure state of b eing attac hed to gr ace [Self] , which is devoid of any attachment, alone is one’s own state of sile nce, which is de void of any other thi ng. Kn ow th at one’s ever abiding as that sile nce, having experienced it as it is, alone is true ment al worship [manasika-p uja]. Know th at the performa nce of the unceasing, true a nd natural wors hip in w hich the mind is su bmissively establishe d as th e one Self, having installed th e Lord o n the Heart-throne, is silence, the best of all forms of wor ship. Silen ce, which is devoid of the a ssertiv e ego, alone is liber ation. Th e evil for getful ness of Self which causes one to slip d own from that silence, alone is no n-devotion [vibhakti]. Know th at abiding a s that sile nce with th e mind s ubsided as no n-different from Self, is the truth o f Siva bhakti [dev otion t o God]. When on e has com pletely surrendered oneself at th e feet of Siva, th ereby becomin g of th e nature of th e Self, th e resulting a bundant pe ace, in whi ch there is not e ven the le ast room within th e Heart for one to make a ny complai nt about one’s def ects a nd deficiencies, alone is the n ature of su preme de votion. On e’s thus becomin g a slave to th e Lord and one’s remainin g quiet and silent, devoid even of the egotistical th ought ‘I am his slave’, is Self-ab idance, and this is the supreme knowledge. Q: Can spiritu al seekers att ain this go al in life if they go about the w orld ab sorbed in sin ging s ongs in pr aise of G od? Or should they stay at one place only? A: It is go od to keep the mind co ncentrated o n one thing on ly wherever t he person wanders. What is the use of keeping the body at one place if the mind is allowed to wa nder? Q: Is ahetuka bhakti [devoti on with out a motive] possible? A: Yes it is possible. Worshippi ng God for t he sake of a desired object is wo rshipping that d esired object alone. The compl ete ce ssatio n of any thought of a desired object is the first prerequisite in a mind which wish es to attai n the state of Siva. 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Q: Sri Bhagavatam outlines a way to find Kris hna in the H eart by prostratin g to all and looking on all as t he Lor d himself. Is this the rig ht path leading to Self-re alizatio n? Is it not easier to a dore Bhagavan in wh atever meets the mind, than to seek the s upramental thr ough the mental en quiry ‘Who am I? ’ A: Yes, wh en you see God in all, do you thin k of Go d or do you not? You must certainly think of G od if you want to see God all round you. Keeping God in your mind i n this way becomes dhyan a [meditation] and dhyana is the sta ge before realization. Re alizatio n can only be in and of the Self. It can never be apart from the Self. Dhyana must pr ecede realizatio n, but wh ether you make d hyana on God or on the Self is immaterial, for th e goal is the same. Yo u cannot, by any means, es cape the Self. You want to see God in all, but not in yourself ? If ev erything is God, are you not included in th at everything? Being God yourself, is it a wonder th at all is Go d? This is the metho d advised in Sri Bhagavatam, and elsewhere by others. But even for this practice th ere must be t he seer or thinker. Who is he? Q: How to se e God who is all-p ervasive? A: To see God is to b e God. There is no all ap art from God for him to pervade. He alone is. Q: The bhakta requires a G od to w hom he can do bhakti. Is he to be taught that th ere is only the Self, not a worshipper and the worshipped? A: Of course, Go d is req uired for sadhana. But the end of th e sadhana, even in bh akti marg a [the pa th of d evotion], is attained only after compl ete surr ender. What does it mea n, except th at effacement of th e ego results in Self remaini ng as it always has been? Whatev er path one may choose, the ‘I’ is inescapable, the ‘I’ that do es the nis hkama karma [motiveless acts], the ‘I’ that pines for jo ining the Lord fr om whom it feels it has been separated, th e ‘I’ that feels it has slipp ed from its real nat ure, an d so on. The source of this ‘I’ must be found out. The n all questions will be solved. Q: If ‘I’ also is an illusio n, who then casts off th e illusion? A: The ‘I’ ca sts off the illusi on of ‘I’ an d yet remains a s ‘I’. Suc h is the paradox of Self- realization. Th e realized do not see any contradiction in it. Take the case of b hakti. I approach Isw ara an d pray to be absorbed in him. I then surrender m yself with fait h and concentrate on him. What remains afterw ards? In place of the ori ginal ‘I’, pe rfect self-s urrender leaves a residuum of God in whic h the ‘I’ is lost. This is the highest form of de votion [parabhakti] and surrender and the height of vairagya [non-a ttachment]. You give up this and that of ‘my’ possessions. If you give up ‘I’ an d ‘mine’ inst ead, all ar e given up at a stro ke. Th e very seed of possession is lost. Thu s the evil is nipped in th e bud or cr ushed in the germ itself.

For him, a true G uru is some one who has realized the Self and who is abl e to use his power to a ssist others towar ds the goal of Self- realization. Sri Rama na ofte n said that Go d, Guru and the Self are id entical; the Gur u is God in human form and, simultan eously, he is also the Self in th e Heart o f each devotee. Be cause he is both inside and outside, his p ower works in two different ways. The o uter G uru gi ves instructions a nd by his power enables the d evotee to keep his attention on the Self; the inner Gur u pulls th e devotee’s mind b ack to its source, ab sorbs it in the Self and finally destroys it. It is a basic tenet o f Sri Ramana’s teaching that a G uru is ne cessary for almost ev eryone wh o is striving t owards a permane nt awareness of th e Self. The catalytic role o f the Gu ru in spirit ual de velopment is th erefor e crucial; ex cept in rare instances, ignorance of th e Self is so deeply rooted that individual seekers ar e unable to escape from it by their own efforts. Although Sri Rama na taught that a Guru is indispensable for th ose seeking Self-re alizatio n, he also pointed out t hat the Guru has no power to b ring a bout realizatio n in those wh o are n ot energetically seeking it. If the individual se eker makes a serious attempt to dis cover th e Self, the n the g race and power o f the Gu ru will automaticall y start to flow. If no such attempt is made, the G uru is he lpless. The c onversations in this ch apter summarise Sri Raman a’s views on the nature of the G uru an d the role h e plays in bringing about realizati on of th e Self. The distinctive way in whi ch Sri Ramana utilise d his ow n power will be explored in g reater det ail in chapter ni ne. Q: What is Guru’s g race? How do es it lead to Self-r ealization? A: Guru is the Self. Sometimes in his life a man becomes dis satisfie d and, not content with wh at he has, he seeks the satisfaction of his de sires thr ough prayer to Go d. His mind is gradually purified until he longs to kn ow God, more to obtain hi s grace than to satisfy his worl dly desires. Then, God’s gra ce begins to manifest. Go d takes the form of a Guru and appears to the d evotee, teaches him the trut h and, moreo ver, pu rifies his mind by association. Th e devotee’s mind gai ns stre ngth and is then able to turn inw ard. By meditatio n it is furth er purified an d it remains still without the least rip ple. That ca lm expanse is the Self. The G uru is bo th external an d inter nal. From the exterior he g ives a push to th e mind to turn it inwar ds. From the interior he pulls the mind to wards the Self and helps in th e quietening of t he mind. That is Guru’s gra ce. Th ere is no difference between Go d, Gur u and the Self. Q: In the The osophical Soci ety they meditate in o rder to seek masters to gu ide them. A: The master is within; meditatio n is meant to remov e the ig norant id ea that he is only outside. If he is a stra nger wh om you await, he is bo und to di sappear also. What is the use of a tra nsient being like th at? But so long as you think you are s eparate o r that you are the body, an external master is also necessary and he will appear to have a body. When th e wro ng identific ation of o neself with th e body ceases, the master will be found to be none other than the Self. Q: Will the Gur u help us to k now the Self thro ugh initiatio n? A: Does the Gu ru hold you by the hand and whisper in the e ar? You may imagi ne him to be what you are yourself. Because you think you are with a b ody, you think he also has a b ody and that he will do somethin g tangible to you. His wor k lies within, in th e spiritual re alm. Q: How is the Gur u found?

But th e Guru w ho is Go d or th e Self incarnate w orks from withi n, helps the man to se e the err or of his w ays and guides him on the rig ht path until he realise s the Self within. Q: What are the marks of a re al teacher [sad guru]? A: Steady abidance in the Self, looking at all with an equal eye unshakeable c ourage at all times, in all places an d circumstan ces. Q: There ar e a numb er of spirit ual tea chers teaching various paths. Whom should on e take for one’s Gur u? A: Choose that on e where you find you get shanti [peac e]. Q: Should w e not also consider his te achings? A: He who instr ucts an ardent se eker to do this or that is no t a true master. The s eeker is alre ady afflicte d by his activities an d wants pe ace and rest. In ot her wor ds he wants cessation of his ac tivities. If a teacher tells him to do somethi ng in a ddition to, or in pl ace of, his other acti vities, can that be a help to the seeker? Activity is creation. Activity is the destruction of on e’s inherent h appiness. If activity is advocated the adviser is not a master but a killer. In such cir cumstan ces eit her th e creator [Brahma] or death [Yama] may be said to h ave come i n the guise of a master. Such a person cannot lib erate th e aspirant, he can only strengthen his fetters. Q: How can I find my own Guru? A: By intense meditati on. Q: If it is tru e that the G uru is on e’s own Self, what is th e principle un derlying the doctrine w hich s ays that, however learned a dis ciple may be or wh atever oc cult powers he may possess, he cannot attain Self-re alizatio n witho ut the grace of the Gu ru? A: Although in ab solute truth th e state of th e Gur u is that of on eself [the Self], it is very hard for th e self whi ch has become th e indi vidual [jiva] through ignorance to re alize its true stat e or nature with out th e grace of the Gur u. Q: What are the marks of th e Guru’s grace? A: It is beyon d words or th oughts. Q: If that is so, ho w is it that it is said t hat the di sciple realise s his true stat e by the Gur u’s gr ace? A: It is like th e elephant whi ch wa kes up on seeing a lion in its dr eam. Even as t he ele phant wa kes up at th e mere sight of the lio n, so too is it certain that th e disciple wa kes up from the sle ep of i gnorance into the wa kefulness of tru e knowledge thr ough the Guru’s benevolent loo k of gr ace. Q: What is the significa nce of the saying that th e nature of th e real G uru is that o f the supreme Lor d [sarvesvaray]? A: First, the individual so ul whi ch desires to att ain the st ate of Go dhood, or th e state of tru e knowledge, practises incessant de votion. When th e individual’s de votion has reached a matur e stag e, the Lor d, who is th e witness o f that individual so ul and identical with it, manif ests. He appears in hum an form with the h elp of sat-chit-ananda, his thr ee natural fe atures, and form and name whic h he also graciously assumes. In the guise of blessing the disciple he absorbs him in himself. According to this do ctrine the Gur u can truly be called th e Lord. Q: How then did s ome great persons att ain kn owledge with out a Gu ru? A: To a few matur e persons the Lor d shines as th e formless light of k nowledge and imparts awareness of th e truth. Q: How is one to decide upon a proper Gu ru? What is the sw arupa [natur e or real form] of a Gu ru? A: He is the p roper Gur u to wh om your mind is attu ned. If you ask, ‘H ow to de cide who is the Gur u and what is his swarupa?’, he should be endowed with tran quillity , patience, forgiveness a nd other virtues; he should be capable of attracting ot hers e ven with his eyes just as a mag net attra cts iron; he should have a feeling o f equality towards all.

How can one know the real nature of th e Guru if on e does not know one’s own real na ture first? If you want to perceive the r eal nat ure or form of the Gur u you must first le arn to lo ok upon the whole universe as Gu ru rupam [the form of the G uru]. One must see the Guru in all living beings. It is the s ame with God. You must loo k upon all objects as G od’s r upa [form] .

Q: Sri Aurobindo and others r efer to you as having had no Guru. A: It all de pends on what you call a Gur u. He need not be in a hum an form. Dattatreya had twenty-four Gu rus including the five elements – ea rth, water, etc. Ev ery object in this world w as his Gu ru. The G uru is ab solutely necessary. The U panishads say that none but a Guru can take a man ou t of the j ungle of intelle ct and sense-perceptions. So ther e must be a Gu ru. Q: I mean a human Guru — Ma harshi did not have one. A: I might ha ve had one at on e time or other. But did I not si ng hymns to Aru nachala? What is a Guru? Guru is God or the Self. First a man p rays to God to fulfil his desires. A time comes w hen he will no more pray for th e fulfilment of material de sires b ut for Go d himself. God then appears to him in some form or other, hum an or n on-huma n, to guide him to himself in an swer to hi s prayer and according to hi s needs. Q: When loyal to on e Mast er can you res pect others? A: Guru is only one. He is not physical. So long as there is weakness th e support of strength is ne eded. Q: J.

A: Yes, it is. Is not your practice itself du e to such grace? The fruits ar e the result of the p ractice an d follow it automatically. There is a sta nza in Kaivalya which says, ‘O Gu ru! Yo u have been always with me, watc hing me through several reincarnations, and ordaining my course un til I was liberated.’ The Self manifests e xternally as the Guru when the occasion aris es, otherwise h e is always within, do ing what is ne cessary. Q: Some disci ples of Shir di Sai Ba ba wo rship a picture of him and say that it is their Guru. How could that be? They can worship it as God, but wh at benefit co uld th ey get by worshipping it as th eir Guru? A: They secure concentratio n by that. Q: That is all ve ry well, I agree. It may be to some extent an e xercise in c oncentratio n. But isn’t a Gur u required for that concentratio n? A: Certainly, but after all, Guru only means guri, co ncentration. Q: How can a lifeless p icture help in developing deep concentration? It re quires a living Guru w ho could show it in practice. It is possible p erhaps for Bha gavan to attain p erfection without a living G uru, bu t is it po ssible for people like myself? A: That is true. Ev en so, by worshipping a lifeless p ortrait, the mind ge ts concentrated to a certain extent. That concentration will not r emain constant unless on e knows one’s own Self by enquiring.

The G uru does not bring a bout Self- realization. He simply remove s the obstacles to it. The Self is always realized. Q: Is it absolutely necessary to have a Guru if on e is se eking Self- realization? A: So long as you seek Self-re alizati on the Guru is ne cessary. Guru is the Self. Take Gu ru to be the re al Self a nd your self as t he individual self. The di sappearance of this se nse of duality is the remo val of ig norance. So long as duality persists in you the Guru is necessary. Because you identify yourself with th e body you think t hat the G uru is als o a body. You are not the body, nor is th e Guru. You are t he Self and so is the G uru. This kn owledge is gai ned by what you call Self- realization. Q: How can one know whether a pa rticular individual is compet ent to be a Guru? A: By the peace of mind found in hi s presence and by the sense of re spect you feel for him.

Where els e should th e fault lie? Q: May one have more th an one spiritual master ? A: Who is a master ? He is the Self after all. Ac cording to t he sta ges of d evelopment of th e mind the Self manifests as the master e xternally. The famous a ncient sai nt Dattatreya said that he had more tha n twenty-four masters. The master is one from whom one learns anything. Th e Guru may be sometimes ina nimate also, as i n the case of D attatreya. God, Guru and the Self ar e identical. A spiritu ally-minde d man thin ks that God is all-pe rvading and takes G od for h is Guru. Later, God brings him in contact with a personal Gur u and the man recognises him as all in all. Lastly the same man is mad e by the grace of the master to fe el that his Self is the reality and nothing el se. Thus he finds that the Self is the master. Q: It is said in Srimad Bhagavad Gita: ‘Realize the Self with pure intelle ct and also by service to the G uru an d by enquiry.’ How ar e they to be reconciled? A: ‘Iswaro Gururatmeti’ - Isw ara, Guru and Self are ide ntical. So lon g as th e sense of d uality persists i n you, you se ek a Guru, thin king that he is diff erent from you. However, he te aches you the trut h and you gai n the i nsight. He who bestows the supreme knowledge of Self up on the soul by makin g it face tow ards Self, alo ne is th e supreme Guru who is praised by sages as the form of God, who is Self. Cling to him. By approaching the Guru and serving him faithfully one should learn through his grace th e cause of one’s birt h and one’s sufferin g. Knowing then that the se are due to on e’s straying from Self, it is be st to abide firml y as Self.

Peace, the one thing which is de sired by everyone, cannot be attain ed in a ny way, by anyon e, at any time or in any place, un less stilln ess of mind is obt ained thr ough the grace of th e sadguru.

Q: Can I dispense with ou tside h elp and by my own effort get to the d eeper truth by myself? A: The very fact that you are possessed of the q uest for the Self is a manifest ation of t he divine g race. It is eff ulgent in the Heart, the in ner being, the real Self.

Th at is why I say there is no real quest witho ut grace, nor is there g race active for him who does not seek the Self. Both ar e necessary. Q: How lon g is a Guru necessary for Self-r ealization? A: Guru is necessary so long as there is ignorance. Ig norance is du e to th e self-impos ed but wrong limitation of the Self. God, on being wo rshipped, be stows ste adiness i n devotion whi ch lea ds to su rrender. On the devotee surrendering, Go d shows his mercy by manif esting a s the G uru. The G uru, ot herwis e God, guides the devotee, saying that G od is within a nd that he is not differ ent from the Self. This leads to intro version of mind a nd finally to realizatio n. Q: If grace is so important, wh at is the role o f individual effort? A: Effort is necessary up to the st ate of re alizatio n. Even then the Self should spontaneously become evi dent, otherwis e happiness will not be compl ete. Up to th at state of sp ontaneity there must be effort in some form or another. There is a state beyon d our efforts o r effortles sness. Until it is realized eff ort is necessary. After tasti ng such blis s, even once, one will repeatedly try to regain it.

Q: Is divine g race necessary for attai ning r ealizati on, or ca n an individual’s ho nest efforts by themselves le ad to t he state fr om which there is no return to life and death? A: Divine grace is ess ential f or realization. It leads one to Go d reali zation. But such grace is vo uchsafed only to him who is a true d evotee or a yogi. It is given only to tho se wh o have striven hard and ceaselessly on the path towards freedom. Q: Does dist ance have any effect upon grace? A: Time an d space are withi n us.

Grace is always there. ‘Disp assion cannot be acquired, nor realizatio n of th e truth, no r inherence in t he Self, in the absence of Guru’s gr ace’. But pr actice is also necessary.

These ‘sile nt teachings’ co nsisted of a spiritual for ce which seemed to ema nate fr om his form, a force so powerful that he considered it to be the most dir ect an d importa nt aspect of his teachings. Inst ead of giving out verbal in structio ns on how to co ntrol th e mind, he effortlessly emitted a silent p ower which automatically quietened the minds o f everyone in his vi cinity . The p eople wh o wer e attuned to this force report th at they experienced it as a state o f inner peace and well-bei ng; in s ome advanced devotees it ev en precipitat ed a dir ect ex perience of the Self. This metho d of te aching has a lo ng tra dition in I ndia, its most famous ex ponent bei ng Dakshinamurti, a manife station of Siva w ho brought four lear ned sages to a n experience of t he Self through the power o f his silen ce. Sri Rama na frequently spoke of D akshinamurti with gr eat ap proval and his name cr ops up in many of the conversations in this chapter. This flow o f power from the Gur u can be received by anyone wh ose attention is fo cused on the Self or on the form of the Guru; dist ance is no impediment to its efficacy. This atte ntion is oft en called sat-sanga, which liter ally means ‘association with b eing’. Sri Raman a wholeheartedly encouraged this pr actice and frequently said that it was the most efficient way of bri nging about a direct experience of the Self. Traditio nally it involves being in th e physical presence of one who has realized the Self, but Sri Rama na gave it a muc h wider d efinitio n. He said that th e most importa nt eleme nt in sat-sanga was the mental co nnection with th e Guru; s at-sanga takes place not o nly in his presence but whenever and wherever on e thinks of h im. The followin g quotation gives an indication of th e power of sat-s anga. It consists of fiv e stray Sanskrit ve rses w hich Sri Rama na came a cross at various times. He was s o impressed by their co ntents that he transl ated them into Tamil and incorporated th em in Ulla du Na rpadu Anubandham, one of his own written wo rks which d eals with the nature of reality. 1 By sat-sanga the association wit h the objects of the wo rld will be remo ved. When th at worldly association is remove d the att achment or tendencies of the mind will be d estroyed. Those wh o are devoid of mental att achme nt will pe rish in th at which is motio nless. Th us they attain j ivan mukti [liberation]. Cherish their a ssociation. 2 The supreme state whi ch is pr aised and which is attain ed here in t his life by clear vic hara, which arises i n the He art when association with a sadhu [a noble person, or on e who has realized the Self] is gained, is impossi ble to attain by listeni ng to pr eachers, by studying and learning the meani ng of th e script ures, by virtuous deeds or by any other means. 3 If on e gains association with sadhus, of what use are all the religi ous observances [ni yamas]? When the excellent cool southern br eeze itself is blowing, wh at is the use of holding a ha nd-fan? 4 Heat will be remov ed by the cool moon, po verty by the celestial wish-f ulfilling tre e and sin by the Ga nges. But know th at all these, beginning with h eat, will be remo ved merely by having the darshan [sight] of incompar able sadhus. 5 Sacr ed bathing places, which are com posed of w ater, an d images o f deities, whi ch are made o f stone and earth, cannot be compar able to those great so uls [mahatmas]. Ah, what a wonder! T he bat hing places and deities be stow purity of mind after c ountless days, whereas such purity is instantly bestowed upon people as soon as sadhus see them with th eir eyes. Q: Why does not Bhagavan go about and preach the truth to th e people at large? A: How do you know I am no t doing it? Does preaching consist in mou nting a p latform and haranguing the people around? Preaching is simple communi cation of knowledge; it can really be done in silence only.

Compar e him with a nother, wh o sits in a ho ly presence and goes aw ay after some time with his o utlook on life totally changed. Which is the better, to preach loudly without eff ect or to sit silently sending out inner for ce? Again, how does speech arise? First there is ab stract kn owledge. Out of t his arises th e ego, which in tur n gives rise to th ought, and thought to the spoken wor d. So th e wor d is the great- gr andson of the o riginal source. If the w ord can produce an effect, judge for yourself, how much more po werful must b e the p reaching thr ough sile nce. Q: How can silen ce be so powerful? A: A realized one sends out w aves of spirit ual influ ence whi ch draw many people to wards him. Yet he may sit in a cave and maintai n complet e silence. We may listen to le ctures upon truth and come a way with hardly any grasp of th e subject, but t o come into c ontact with a re alized one, though he speaks nothing, will give much more gr asp of the subject. He never needs to go out amo ng the public. If necessary he can use others as i nstruments. The G uru is th e bestower o f silence wh o reveals th e light of Self-kn owledge which s hines as th e residual re ality. Spoken words are o f no use wh atsoever if the eyes of the Gur u meet the eyes of the dis ciple. Q: Does Bh agavan give diksha [initiation]? A: Mouna [silence] is the best and the most potent dik sha. That was practise d by Sri Da kshinamurti. Initiation by touch, lo ok, etc., ar e all of a lower o rder. Silent initiatio n changes the hearts of all. Dakshinamurti observed sile nce when the disciples ap proached him. That is the highest form of initiatio n. It includes the other forms. There must be subject-object relati onship est ablished in the other di kshas. First the s ubject must emanate an d then the object. Unless these two ar e there how is th e one to look at th e other or touch him ? Mouna diksha is the most perfect; it com prises lo oking, tou ching and teaching. It will purify the indi vidual in ev ery way and establish him in the r eality. Q: Swami Vivekananda says that a spiritual Guru can tra nsfer s pirituality substantially to the dis ciple. A: Is there a substance to b e transferr ed? Transfer means er adication of the s ense of be ing the dis ciple. Th e master does it. Not th at the man wa s somethin g at on e time and metamorp hosed later into an other. Q: Is not grace the gift of the G uru? A: God, grace and Gur u are all synonymous and also eternal a nd immane nt. Is not the Self already within? Is it for the Guru to be stow it by his look? If a Gu ru thin ks so, h e does not deserve the name. The b ooks say that there a re so many kinds of d iksha, initiatio n by hand, by touch, by eye, etc. They also say that the G uru mak es some rites with fire, water, ja pa or mantr as and calls s uch fantastic perf orman ces dikshas, as if the dis ciple be comes ripe only after such processes are gone through by the Gu ru. If the individual is so ught he is no where to b e found. Such is th e Guru. Such is Da kshinamurti. What did he do? He wa s silent wh en the disci ples ap peared before him. He maintai ned silence and the doubts of the disciples w ere dis pelled, which means th at they lost their in dividual id entities. That is jn ana and not all th e verbiage usually associated with it. Silenc e is the most potent form of work. However vast an d emp hatic th e sastras may be they fail in th eir effect. Th e Guru is quiet and peace prevails in all. His silence is more vast and more emp hatic t han all th e sastr as put together. These questions aris e because of the feeling th at, having been here so long, heard so muc h, exerted so hard, on e has not gained anything. The wor k proceeding withi n is not apparent. In fact the G uru is alw ays withi n you. Q: Can the G uru’s sile nce really bring about advanced states of s piritual aw areness? 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman A: There is an old story which demonstrates th e power of t he Gur u’s sile nce. Tattv araya composed a b harani, a ki nd of poetic compo sition in Tamil, in ho nour of his Gur u Swarupananda, an d convened an a ssembly of learned pandits to hear the work and assess its value. The pandits raised the objection that a bharani was only compos ed in h onour of great he roes capable of killin g a thousand elephants in battl e and that it was not in order to comp ose such a wor k in honour of a n ascetic. Th ereupon the author sai d, ‘Let u s all go to my Guru and we s hall ha ve this matter settle d ther e.’ They went to the Gu ru and, after t hey had all taken their se ats, the author told his G uru th e purpose of th eir visit. The Guru sat sile nt and all the others als o remaine d in mou na. The wh ole day passed, th e night came, and some more days and nights, an d yet all sat there silently, no thought at all occurring to any of them and nobody thinking or as king why they had com e there. After thr ee or four days like this, the G uru mov ed his mind a bit, and the people assembled immediatel y regained their thought activity. They then declared, ‘Co nquering a th ousand ele phants is no thing beside this Gur u’s po wer to conquer the rutting el ephants of all ou r egos put t ogether. So cert ainly he deserves th e bharani in his ho nour!’ Q: How does this sile nt power wor k? A: Language is only a medium for communicati ng on e’s thoughts to another. It is called in only after th oughts a rise. Other thoughts arise aft er the ‘I’-th ought rises a nd so the ‘I’-thought is the root of all conversation. When one remains without thin king one understands another by means of the universal lan guage of sile nce. Silenc e is ever-speaking. It is a perennial flow of la nguage whi ch is interr upted by speaking. These wor ds I am speaking obstruct that mute language. For ex ample, ther e is electricity flowing in a wire. With resistance to its passage, it glows as a lamp o r revolves as a fan. In the wire it remains a s electric energy. Similarly also, silence is the eter nal flow o f language, ob structed by words. What one fails to know by conversation extending to se veral years can be known in stantly in silence, or in fro nt of silence -Dakshinamurti and his f our dis ciples are a good example o f this. This is th e highest an d most eff ective language. Q: Bhagavan says, ‘The i nfluence of the j nani steals into th e devotee in sile nce.’ Bh agavan als o says, ‘Contact with great men [ mahatmas] is one effic acious mea ns of re alising o ne’s true being.’ A: Yes. What is the contradiction ? Jnani, gre at men, mahatmas – do you differ entiate between them? Q: No. A: Contact with th em is good. They will work through silence. By speaking t heir po wer is re duced. Silenc e is most powerful. Speech is always less p owerful tha n silen ce, so ment al contact is the b est. Q: Does this h old good even after th e dissolutio n of the p hysical body of the jnani or is it true o nly so long as h e is in flesh and blood? A: Guru is not the p hysical form. So the contact will remain e ven after th e physical form of the Gu ru vanishes. On e can go to another Gur u after on e’s Guru passes aw ay, but all Gurus a re one and none of th em is the f orm you see. Always mental co ntact is the best. Q: Is the operation of gr ace the mind of th e Gur u acting on the mind of th e disciple or is it a different pr ocess? A: The highest form of grace is silen ce. It is als o the hi ghest up adesa [teaching]. Q: Vivekananda has also said th at silence is the loudest form of prayer. A: It is so f or the seeker’s sile nce. Th e Guru’s silence is the lo udest up adesa. It is also gr ace in its highest form. All other di kshas [initiations] are derived from mouna, and are therefore se condary. Mouna is th e primary form. If the Guru is silent the s eeker’s mind ge ts purified by itself. Q: Sri Bhagavan’s silence is itself a powerful f orce. It brings about a certain peace of mind in us. A: Silence is ne ver-ending speech. Vo cal sp eech obstructs the ot her speech of silen ce. In sile nce one is in intimate contact with the surroundings.

The fire o f wisdom consumes all actions. Wisdom is acquired by association with th e wise [sat- sanga] or rather its mental atmos phere. Q: Can the G uru’s sile nce brin g about realizati on if the dis ciple mak es no effort ? A: In the p roximity of a g reat master, th e vasanas cease to be active, th e mind becomes still and samadhi results. Thu s the disciple gains true k nowledge and right ex perience in th e presence of the master. To remain un shaken in it furth er efforts are necessary. Eventually the dis ciple will kn ow it to be his real be ing and will th us be liberated even while alive. Q: If the s earch has to be made withi n, is it necessary to be in th e physical proximity of the Master ? A: It is ne cessary to be so until all do ubts are at a n end. Q: I am not able to co ncentrate by myself. I am in se arch of a for ce to he lp me. A: Yes, that is call ed grace. Individually we ar e incapable b ecause the mind is we ak. Gr ace is ne cessary. Sadhu seva [servin g a sadhu] will bri ng it about. Ther e is however nothing new to get. Just as a weak man com es under the control of a stronger one, the weak mind of a man c omes un der control ea sily in the presence of str ong-minde d sadhus. That which is is only grace; ther e is nothing el se. Q: Is it necessary to serve the Gu ru physically? A: The sastras say that o ne must ser ve a G uru for twelve years in or der to attai n Self- re alizati on. What does the Gur u do? Does he hand it ov er to th e disciple? Is not the Self always realized? What does the c ommon belief mea n then? Man is alw ays the Self and yet he does not know it. Instead he c onfounds it with th e non-Self, the body, etc. Suc h confusion is due to ignorance. If ig norance is wiped out the confusion will ce ase to exist an d the true knowledge will be unfolded. By remaini ng in c ontact with re alized sages the man gradually loses the ignorance until its remov al is compl ete. The eternal Self is thus revealed. Q: You say that a ssociation with the wis e [sat-sa nga] and service o f them is required of th e disciple. A: Yes, the first re ally means a ssociation with the u nmanif est sat or absolute exi stence, but a s very few c an do that, they have to take second best which is association with the manif est sat, that is, the Gur u. Association with sages should be mad e because th oughts a re so p ersistent. The sage has already overcome the mind a nd remains in pe ace. Being in his p roximity helps to bri ng about this co nditio n in ot hers, ot herwis e there is no meani ng in s eeking hi s company. The Gu ru provides th e needed strength for this, un seen by others. Service is primaril y to abide in the Self, but it also includes making th e Gur u’s bo dy comforta ble an d looking aft er his place of abode. Contact with the Gu ru is also necessary, but this means spirit ual co ntact. If the d isciple finds the Gur u inter nally, then it does not matter where he goes.

Sri Ramana maintain ed that other techniques could only take one to th e place wh ere self-enquiry starts an d so h e never endorsed them unl ess he felt that pa rticular q uestioners wer e unable or unwilling to a dopt self-en quiry. This is illustrate d by a conversation in Sri Ramana Gita ( an early collection of his q uestions a nd answers) in w hich Sri Ramana e xplained in detail why self-en quiry was th e only way to reali ze the Self. After listeni ng carefully to Sri Raman a’s ex planation the questioner w as still unwilling to a ccept th at self-en quiry was t he only route to th e Self an d so he a sked if ther e were any other metho ds by which the Self co uld be realized. Sri Raman a replied: The g oal is th e same for th e one who meditates [on an object] and the o ne who practises self- en quiry. One attain s stillness t hrough meditation, th e other through knowledge. One striv es to attai n somethin g; the ot her seeks the one who strive s to attain. The f ormer takes a longer time, but in the e nd att ains th e Self. Not w anting to sh ake the faith o f a man wh o had a kn own predilection f or subject-object meditation a nd, having alr eady ascertained that he was unwilling to ta ke up self- en quiry, Sri Raman a encouraged him to follow his ow n chosen meth od by telling him that it would en able him to reach the Self. In Sri Rama na’s vi ew any metho d is better t han no meth od sin ce there is always the possibilit y that it will lea d to self-e nquiry. He gave many other similar replies t o other people for similar rea sons. These replies, which i ndicate that meth ods other tha n self-e nquiry or surrender could result in Self-realiz ation, should no t be taken at face value sin ce they were only given to people who were no t attract ed to s elf-enquiry and who wanted to f ollow th eir own meth ods. When he spoke to oth er devotees w ho were no t attached to what he called ‘in direct meth ods’, he would us ually reaffirm that self-att ention was ultimately indispensable. Although Sri Rama na vigorously defended his views on self-en quiry he never insist ed that anyone ch ange their beli efs or practices and, if he was unable to convince his follow ers to tak e up self-en quiry, he would happily give advice on other metho ds. In the c onversations in this ch apter he is mostly answering questions from devotees wh o wanted advice on conventional forms of meditatio n (dhyana). In giving this ad vice he usually defined meditatio n as concentration o n one thought to th e exclusion of all ot hers, bu t he sometimes gave it a higher definition by saying that keeping the mind fixe d in the Self was tr ue meditatio n. This latter practice is re ally another name for s elf-enquiry, for, as he explained in one of his e arly writte n works, ‘Alw ays keeping the mind fix ed in Self alo ne is ca lled self-enquiry, whereas meditatio n is thinking on eself to be Brahman.’ Q: What is the differ ence between meditatio n [dhyana] and investigati on [vichar a]? A: Both amo unt to th e same. Those unfit for in vestigatio n must practise meditation. In medit ation th e aspirant forgettin g himself medit ates ‘I am Bra hman’ or ‘I am Siva’ and by this method holds on to Brahman or Siva. This will ultimately end with th e resid ual aw areness of Brahman or Siva as b eing. He will then realize that this is pure being, that is, the Self. He who engages in in vestig ation st arts by holding on to himself, and by asking himself ‘Who am I? ’ the Self becomes clear to him.

Q: Meditation is more dir ect tha n investigation be cause the f ormer holds on to th e truth w hereas th e latter sifts the truth fr om the untruth. A: For the beginner medit ation on a form is more e asy and agreeable. Practi ce of it leads to self-en quiry which consists in siftin g the re ality from unreality. What is the use of holding on to tr uth wh en you are filled with a ntagonistic fact ors? Self-en quiry directly leads to realizatio n by removin g the o bstacles w hich mak e you think that the Self is not already realized.

Q: But th oughts c ome up. Is ou r effort meant to eliminate th oughts on ly? A: Yes. Meditati on being on a single t hought, the other thoughts are kept away. Meditation is on ly negative in e ffect in as muc h as th oughts ar e kept away. Q: It is said ‘atma samsth am mana h krtv a’ [fixing the mind in th e Self]. But th e Self is un thinkable. A: Why do you wish to meditate at all ? Because you wish to d o so you are told ‘atma samstham manah krtva’. Wh y do you no t remain as you are with out meditatin g? What is that ‘manah’ [mind]? When all thoughts are eliminat ed it becomes ‘ atma samsth a’ [fixed in the Self]. Q: If a form is given I can meditate on it and other thoughts are eliminate d. But the Self is formless. A: Meditatio n on forms or concrete ob jects is sai d to be dhyana, whereas the enquiry into t he Self is vichara [enq uiry] or nididhyasana [uninterr upted aw areness of being]. Q: There is more ple asure in dhyan a than in sensual enjoyments. Yet th e mind r uns after the latter a nd does not s eek the former. Why is it so? A: Pleasure or pa in are aspects o f the mind on ly. Our es sential nature is happiness. But w e have forgotten the Self an d imagin e that the b ody or the mind is the Self. It is that wro ng identity that giv es rise to misery . What is to be done? This mental te ndency is very ancient and has continued for innumerabl e past birt hs. Hence it has grown stro ng. That must go before the e ssential nature, ha ppiness, asserts itself. Q: How is dhyana pr actise d – with eyes open or cl osed? A: It may be done either w ay. The p oint is that the mind must be introverted and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are closed the late nt tho ughts rus h forth with g reat vigour. It may also be difficult to introvert th e mind with the eyes open. It requires stre ngth o f mind to do so. The mind is co ntaminat ed wh en it tak es in objects. Oth erwise, it is pure. Th e main factor i n dhyana is to ke ep the mind acti ve in its ow n pursuit witho ut taking in external impre ssions or thin king of ot her matters. Q: Bhagavan, wh enever I meditat e, I feel great heat in the head and, if I pe rsist, my whole bo dy burns. What is the remedy? A: If concentratio n is made with th e brain, sensations of heat and even headache ensue. Concentratio n has to be made in th e Heart, whi ch is co ol and refreshing. Rela x and your meditatio n will be easy. Keep your mind ste ady by gently warding o ff all intrudi ng thoughts b ut with out strain. Soon you will succeed. Q: How do I prevent m yself fallin g asle ep in medit ation? A: If you try to prevent slee p it will mean thi nking in meditatio n, which must be avoided. But if you slip into sl eep while medit ating, the medit ation will continue even during and after sleep. Yet, being a thought, sleep must be got rid of, for th e final na tural stat e has to be obtained consciously in jagrat [the wa king state] without the d isturbing th ought. Waking a nd sleeping a re mere pict ures o n the screen of the native, th ought-fre e state. Let them pass unnoticed. Q: What is to b e meditate d upon? A: Anything that you prefer. 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Q: Siva, Vish nu and gayatri are said to be equally efficacious. Which should I meditate u pon? A: Any one you like best. They are all eq ual in th eir effect. But you should stic k to on e. Q: How do I meditat e? A: Concentrate o n that one whom you like b est. If a single thought prevails, all other thoughts are put off an d finally eradicated. So lo ng as d iversity prevails th ere ar e bad thoughts.

As so on as you begin meditation ot her th oughts will cro wd to gether, gather for ce and try to sink the single t hought to which you tr y to ho ld. The g ood thought must gradually gain strength by repeated p ractice. After it has grown strong the ot her th oughts will be put to flig ht. This is th e battle royal always taking place in meditatio n. One wants to rid oneself of misery. It requires peace of mind, which means absence of perturbation owing to all kinds of thoughts. Pea ce of mind is br ought ab out by dhyana alo ne. Q: Since Sri Bh agavan says that th e Self may function at any of the centres or chakras while its se at is in the He art, is it not possible that by the practice of inte nse concentratio n or dhyan a between the eyebrow s this centre may become the seat of th e Self? A: Any consideratio n about th e seat of the Self is theoretical if you fix your attention on a place in th e body. You consider yourself as the subject, the seer, and the pl ace where you fix your attentio n becomes t he object seen. This is merely bhavana [mental imag ery]. When, on the contrary, you se e the seer himself, you merge in th e Self an d you become o ne wit h it. That is the H eart. Q: Is the practice of c oncentratio n between the eyebro ws ad visable? A: The fin al result of th e practice o f any kind of dhyan a is that the o bject on which t he seeker fixes hi s mind c eases to exist as distin ct and separate from the subject. They, the subject and object, become the o ne Self, an d that is the Heart. Q: Why does not Sri Bhagavan dire ct us to pr actise concentratio n on some pa rticular c entre or chakra? A: Yoga Sastra says that the sahasrara [the ch akra located in the brain] or the brai n is the seat of the Self. Purusha Sukta declares that the H eart is its seat. To enable the sadhaka to steer clear of p ossible do ubt, I tell him to take up the thread or the clue of ‘I’-n ess or ‘I am’-ne ss and follow it up to its source. Be cause, firstl y, it is impossibl e for anybo dy to entertain any doubt about this ‘I’ notion. Seco ndly, whatever be the means adopted, the final g oal is th e realization of the source of ‘I am’-ne ss whi ch is th e primary datum of your ex perience. If you ther efore practise self-e nquiry, you will re ach the He art which is the Self. Q: I practise h atha yoga a nd I also meditate ‘I am Brahman’. After a few moments of this meditatio n, a blank prevails, the brain g ets he ated and a fear of de ath arises. What should I do ? A: ‘I am Bra hman’ is only a thought. Who says it? Brahman itself do es not say so. What ne ed is there f or it to say it? Nor c an the real ‘I’ say so. For ‘I’ always abides as Brahman. To be saying it is only a thought. Whose th ought is it? All thoughts are from the u nreal ‘I’, th at is the ‘I’-tho ught. Remain with out thi nking. So long as there is thought there will be f ear. Q: As I go on thinking of it ther e is forgetfuln ess, the b rain b ecomes he ated and I am afr aid. A: Yes, the mind is co ncentrated in the brain an d hence you get a hot sensatio n ther e. It is be cause of the ‘I’-th ought. When th e ‘I’-thought arises fe ar of de ath arises simultan eously. With regard t o forgetfuln ess, so lo ng as there is thought ther e will be forgetful ness. First there is th e thought ‘I am Brahman’, then forgetfuln ess su pervenes. Forgetfuln ess an d thought ar e for th e ‘I’- th ought on ly. Hold on to it and it will dis appear like a ph antom. What remains o ver is the real ‘I’ an d that is the Self. ‘I am Bra hman’ is an aid to co ncentration since it keeps off ot her th oughts. When that o ne thought alone persists, see 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman whose thought it is. It will be found to be fr om ‘I’. From where is the ‘I’- th ought? Probe into it, the ‘I’-th ought will vanish, and the supreme Self will shi ne forth of itself. No further eff ort is needed. When th e one real ‘I’ remains al one, it will not be saying ‘I am Brahman’. Do es a man g o on repeating ‘I am a man’ ? Unless he is challenged, why should he declare himself a man ? Does anyone mistak e himself for an animal that he should say, ‘No, I am not an animal, I am a man’ ? Similarly , Brahman or ‘I’ be ing the only existing reality, there is no one there to ch allenge it and so there is no need to be r epeating ‘I am Bra hman’. Q: Why should one adopt this s elf-hypnotism by thinking on the unthinkable po int? Why not adopt other metho ds like g azing int o light, holding the breath, he aring music, he aring inter nal so unds, repetition of th e sacred syllable om or other mantra s? A: Light-ga zing stu pefies the mind an d produces cat alepsy of the will for the time being, but it secures n o permanent benefit. Breath co ntrol temp orarily benumbs the will but it is not permane nt. It is the same with listeni ng to so unds, un less th e mantra is sa cred and secures the help of a h igher po wer to p urify and raise the thoughts. Q: We are advised to co ncentrate on the spot in th e forehead between the eyebrows. Is this right ? A: Everyone is aw are - ‘I am’. Lea ving aside that aw areness o ne goes about in s earch of G od. What is the use of fixing one’s atte ntion b etween the eyebrows ? It is mere folly to say that God is between the eyebrows. Th e aim of such advice is to he lp the mind to concentrate. It is on e of th e forcible metho ds to ch eck the mind an d prevent its dissipation. It is forcibly directed into on e channel. It is a help to concentration. But th e best mea ns of re alizatio n is the enquiry ‘Who am I? ’ The present trouble is to the mind an d it must be remov ed by the mind only. Q: I do not alw ays concentrate on the same ce ntre in th e body. Sometimes I find it easier to c oncentrate o n one centre and sometimes on another. And sometimes wh en I co ncentrate on one centre th e thought of its own accord goes and fixes itself in another. Wh y is that? A: It may be because of past practices of yours. But in any case it is immaterial on whi ch centre you co ncentrate sinc e the real He art is in e very centre an d even outside t he body. On whatever part of the body you may concentrate or o n whatever ext ernal object, the He art is there. Q: Can one concentrate at on e time on one centre and at another time on another or should one concentrate always consistently on the same centre? A: As I have just said, there can be no harm wherever you concentrate, be cause concentration is on ly a mea ns of giving u p thoughts. Whatev er the centre or object on which you concentrate, he who concentrates is always the same. Q: Some say that on e should practise meditatio n on gross objects on ly. It may be disastro us if one constantly seeks to kill the mind. A: For whom is it disastrous? Can ther e be d isaster apart from the Self? Unbroken ‘I, I’ is the infinite o cean. Th e ego, the ‘I’-t hought, remain s only a bubble on it and is call ed jiva or individual soul. Th e bubble too is wat er for wh en it bursts it only mixes in t he ocean. When it remains a bu bble it is still a part of th e ocean. Ignorant of this simple truth, in numera ble metho ds under different de nominations, such as yoga, bhakti, karma, ea ch again with many modifi cations, are being taught with gr eat skill an d in intric ate det ail only to entice the s eekers an d confuse their minds. So also are the r eligio ns and sects and dogmas. What are they all for? Only for knowing the Self. They are aids and practice s required for knowing the Self. Objects pe rceived by the senses are spoken of as immediate kn owledge [prat yaksh a]. Can anything be as direct as the Self -always experienced wit hout the aid o f the senses? Sense- pe rceptions can only be indirect knowledge, and not direct knowledge. Only one’s own awareness is direct knowledge, and that is the common e xperience of one and all. No aids are needed to kn ow one’s own Self. 73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Chapter 11 Mantra s and japa A mantra is a wor d or ph rase whi ch has been given to a di sciple by a Guru, us ually as part of an initiati on rite. If the Guru has accumulat ed spiritu al power as a result of hi s realization o r meditation, some of t his power is transmitted in the mantr a. If the disciple re peats t he wor d continuously, the power of th e Guru is in voked in such a w ay that it hel ps the disciple to progress towar ds the goal of Self- realization. Sri Ramana ac cepted the v alidity of this approach but he very rarely gave out mantra s himself and he never used them as part of an initiation c eremo ny. He di d, on the other hand, speak highly of the p ractice of nam a-japa (the continuous re petitio n of God’s name) a nd he often advocated it as a useful ai d for th ose wh o wer e followi ng the path of surr ender. In chapter I it was pointed out that surrender to God or the Self co uld be effectively practise d by being aw are at all times that there is no individual ‘I’ acti ng and thinking, only a ‘higher p ower’ whic h is responsible f or all the activities of the world. Sri Ramana re commend ed japa as an effective way of culti vating this attitude since it replaces an awareness o f the individual an d the worl d with a constant awareness of this h igher po wer. In its early stages the r epetition of th e name of G od is on ly an exercise in concentration and meditati on, but with continued practice a st age is reached in whic h the r epetition pr oceeds effortles sly, automatically and continuously. This sta ge is not r eached by concentration alone but only by compl etely surrendering to th e deity whose nam e is being repeated: ‘To us e the n ame of Go d one must call up on him with yearnin g and unreservedly surrender oneself to him. Only after su ch surrender is the name o f God constantly with the man.’ When Sri Ramana tal ked about this ad vanced stage of j apa there wa s an almost m ystical dime nsion to his ideas. He would speak of th e identity of the name of Go d with th e Self an d sometimes he would even say that when the Self is reali zed the name o f God repeats itself effortlessly and continuously in the H eart. This ultimate stag e is only reached aft er the practice of japa merges int o the p ractice of self- att ention. Sri Ramana usually illustr ated th e necessity of this tra nsition by quoting from the wo rds of N amdev, a fourteenth-century Maharashtra sai nt: ‘The all-pe rvading nature of the Name ca n only be understood wh en one recognises o ne’s own ‘I’. When on e’s own name is not recognized, it is impossi ble to ge t the all-pe rvading Name.’ This qu otation com es from a short work by Namdev e ntitled Th e Philos ophy of the Divin e Name an d the full text is given in on e of Sri Ramana’s answers later in the c hapter. He first dis covered it in 1937 and for the last thirte en years of his life he kept a copy of it on a small bookshelf by his bed. He fre quently read it out w hen visitors a sked him about the nature an d usefulness of japa and from the num ber of times he spoke of it with ap proval it is reasonable to assume that he fully endorsed its contents. Q: My practice has been a continuous japa of the name s of God with the in coming b reath an d the name of Sai Bab a with th e outgoing breath. Simultane ously with this I see the form of Baba always. Even in Bha gavan, I see Ba ba. Now, should I co ntinue this or c hange the meth od, as s omethin g from withi n says that if I stick to the n ame an d form I shall never go above name a nd form? B ut I can’t un derstand what furt her to do after gi ving up name an d form. Will Bhagavan enli ghten me on this p oint? A: You may continue in your present metho d. When t he japa becomes c ontinuous, all ot her th oughts ce ase and one is in one’s real nat ure, whi ch is ja pa or dhyan a. We turn ou r mind outwards on things of the wo rld an d are therefore n ot aware of o ur real nature bei ng always japa. When by conscious eff ort of japa or dhyana, as we call it, we prevent our mind from thinking of o ther things, then what remains is ou r real n ature, which is japa. So lon g as you think you are nam e and form, you can’t e scape name an d form in japa also. When you realize you are not name an d form, then name an d form will drop of themsel ves. No ot her eff ort is necessary. Japa or dhyan a will nat urally and as a matter of co urse lead to it. What is now regarded as the mea ns, japa, will then be found to be the goal. Name an d God are not diff erent. This is cle arly shown in the teachings of Namdev. 1 The Name perme ates de nsely the sky and the low est regions and the entire un iverse. Who can tell to what de pths in the nether regions and to what height in the h eavens it extends. The ignorant undergo the 84 lakhs [8.4 million] of 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman species of births, no t knowing the essence of thin gs. Namde v says the N ame is immortal. Forms are innumera ble, but the Name is all that. 2 The Name itself is Form. There is no distinction be tween Name a nd Form. God became manifest an d assumed Name an d Form. Hence the N ame the Vedas establis hed. Beware there is no mantra beyon d the N ame. Those w ho say otherwis e are ignorant. Namdev says the N ame is Ke shava [God] Himself. This is known only to the loving d evotees of the Lord. 3 The all-pervading nature of th e Name ca n only be understood when one recognises on e’s own ‘I’. When on e’s own name is no t recognized, it is impossibl e to get th e all-pe rvading Name. When one knows o neself, the n one finds the Name ev erywhere. To se e the Name a s different from the Name d creates illusio n. Namdev says, ‘Ask the Saints.’ 4 No one can reali ze the N ame by practice of kn owledge, meditatio n or austerity . Surrender yourself first at the f eet of th e Guru and learn to know that ‘I’ m yself is that Name. After fin ding the source of that ‘I’ merg e your in dividuality in that oneness whi ch is self-e xistent and devoid of all du ality. That whi ch pervades beyond d vaita [duality] and dvaitatita [that which is beyond du ality], that Name h as com e into the t hree worlds. The Name is Para brahman itself where ther e is no action arising out of d uality. The same idea is als o found in the Bibl e: ‘In the beginning was t he Word and the Word was wit h God and the Word was G od.’ Q: So th e true name o f God will ultimately be revealed by self-en quiry? A: Since you yourself ar e the form of th e japa, if you know your own nature by enquiring wh o you are, what a w onder it will be! T he japa which wa s previously going on with e ffort will then continue untiringly and effortlessly in the Heart. Q: How lon g should I do japa for? Should I also concentrate o n an image of Go d at th e same time? A: Japa is more important th an external form. It must be done until it becomes nat ural. It starts with effort an d is continued until it proceeds of itself. When nat ural it is called realization. Japa may be done even whil e engaged in other work. That which is, is the one reality. It may be represented by a form, a japa, mantra, vi chara, or any kind of att empt to reach reality. All of th em finally resolve themselve s into that one single re ality. Bhakti, vichara and japa are only different forms of our efforts to k eep out the unreality. The unreality is an obsession at p resent bu t our true nature is re ality. We are wro ngly persisting in u nreality, that is, attachment to th oughts a nd worldly activities. Ce ssatio n of th ese will reveal the trut h. Our attempts ar e directed towards k eeping them out and this is do ne by thinking of the reality only. Although it is our true nat ure it loo ks as if we are thin king of it while doi ng these practices. What we do really amounts to th e remov al of obstacles for th e revelatio n of ou r true b eing. Q: Are our attempts sure to s ucceed? A: Realization is ou r nature. It is nothing n ew to b e gained. What is ne w cannot be eternal. Therefore ther e is no need for do ubting w hether on e could lose or gain the Self. Q: Is it good to d o japa when we know that enquiry into the Self is the real thing? A: All meth ods ar e good since they will le ad to th e enquiry eventually. Japa is ou r real na ture. When we r ealize t he Self then japa goes on without effort. What is the mea ns at on e stage becomes the goal at another. When effortle ss constant japa goes on, it is realization. Q: I am not lear ned in the s criptur es and I fin d the metho d of self-e nquiry too hard for me.

Q: For co ntrolling th e mind, whi ch of the two is be tter, performing ja pa of the ajapa [unsp oken] mantr a or of omk ar [the sound of ‘om’]? A: What is your idea of u nspoken and involuntary japa [ajapa]? Will it be ajapa if you go on repeating with th e mouth ‘soham, soham’ [‘I am he, I am he ’]? Aj apa really means t o know that j apa which goes on involuntarily witho ut being uttered thr ough the mouth. Without knowing this re al meaning people think t hat it means rep eating with th e mouth the words ‘so ham, soham’ hundreds of th ousands of times, counting them on the fing ers or on a strin g of beads. Before be ginning a japa breath c ontrol is prescribed. That mean s, first do pranayama [regulati ng of b reath] and then begin repeating the mantra. Pran ayama means first closing the mouth, do esn’t it? If, by stopping the breath, the five eleme nts in the body are bound down an d controlled, wh at remains is th e real Self. That Self will by itself be repeating alw ays ‘aham, aham’ [‘I, I’]. That is aj apa. Knowing this, ho w could th at which is repeated by mouth be ajapa? The visi on of the real Self whi ch performs ja pa of its own accord involuntarily and in a n ever-ending stre am, like th e flowin g down continuously of oil, is ajapa, gayatri and everything. If you kn ow who it is that is doing japa you will know what japa is. If you search and try to fin d out w ho it is that is doing japa, that japa itself b ecomes the Self. Q: Is there no benefit at all in do ing japa with the mouth ? A: Who s aid th ere is no benefit? Such japa will be the mea ns for ch itta su ddhi [purifying the mind]. As the japa is done repeatedly the effort rip ens and sooner or later lea ds to th e right pat h. Good or bad, whatever is done never goes to wast e. Only the differences an d the merits and demerits of each will have to be told, loo king to the st age of development of t he person concerned. Q: Is not mental ja pa better t han oral japa? A: Oral japa consists of s ounds. Th e sounds arise fr om thoughts, for on e must thin k before one expresses the t houghts in wor ds. The th oughts f orm the mind. Th erefore mental ja pa is bett er than oral japa. Q: Should w e not contemplate th e japa and repeat it orally also? A: When the j apa becomes mental, where is the need for the s ounds? Japa, be comin g mental, becomes co ntemplati on. Dhyana, co ntemplati on and ment al japa are the s ame. When th oughts c ease to be promisc uous and one thought persists to the e xclusion of all oth ers, it is sai d to be contemplatio n. The object of j apa or d hyana is the e xclusion of several thoughts and confining on eself to one single tho ught. Then that tho ught too v anishes into its source -a bsolute consciousness. The Self, the mind en gages in japa and then sinks into its own source. Q: The mind is said to be from the brain. A: Where is the brain? It is in the b ody. I say that the body itself is a projection of th e mind. You speak of the b rain w hen you thin k of th e body. It is the mind whi ch creates t he body, the brain in it and also ascertains that th e brain is its se at. Q: Sri Bhagavan has said that th e japa must be traced to its so urce. Is it not the mind that is meant ? A: All th ese are only the workings of the mind. Ja pa helps to fix t he mind on a single tho ught. All other thoughts are first su bordinated until they disappear.

Q: People gi ve some n ames to Go d and say that th e name is sa cred and that re petitio ns of the n ame be stow merit on the individual. Can it be true ? A: Why not? You bear a name to whi ch you answer. But your bo dy was not born with th at name written on it, nor did it say to anyone that it bore such and such a name. An d yet a name is given to you and you an swer to t hat name, because you ha ve identifie d yourself with the name. Therefore the n ame signified somet hing a nd it is not a mere ficti on.

On waking u p I recollect that my japa has been interrupted. So I try again. A: ‘Like sle ep’, that is rig ht. It is the nat ural stat e. Because you are now as sociated with the ego, you consider t hat the natural stat e is somethin g which interr upts your work. So you must ha ve the experience repeated u ntil you realiz e that it is your natural state. Yo u will th en fin d that japa is extraneous but still it will go on automatically. Your present doubt is due to that false i dentity, namely of identifying yourself with the mind th at does the japa. Japa mea ns clin ging to one thought to th e exclusion of all ot her th oughts. Th at is its purpose. It leads to dhyana whi ch ends in Self- realizatio n or jnana. Q: How should I carry on japa? A: One should not use the nam e of God mech anically and superficially without th e feeling of de votion. Q: So mech anical repetition is un productive? A: Acute dise ases will no t be cured merely by repeating the name of th e medicine but only by drinking the medicine. Similarl y, the bonds of birt h and death will not cease merely by doing many repetition s of maha vakyas such as ‘I am Siva’. Inste ad of wandering about repeating ‘I am th e supreme’, abide as th e supreme yourself. The misery of birth and death will no t cease by vocally repeating countless times ‘I am that’, but only by abiding as th at. Q: Can anyone g et any benefit by repeating s acred syllables/mantras] picked up casually? A: No. He must be c ompet ent an d initiate d in su ch mantr as. This is illustrat ed by the st ory of the king and his minister. A king visited his p remier in his resi dence. Th ere he was tol d that th e premier was e ngaged in r epetitio n of sacred syllables. The ki ng waited f or him, and on meeting him, asked wh at the mantr a was. The p remier said th at it was the holiest of all, gayatri. The king desired to be initiated by the premier but th e premier confessed his in ability to initiate him. Therefore the ki ng learned it from some one else, an d, meetin g the minister later, he r epeated the gayatri and wanted to know if it was right. Th e minister sai d that th e mantra was c orrect, but it was not proper for him to say it. When pressed for an explanation, the minister called to a pa ge close by and ordered him to take hold of the king. The o rder was n ot obeyed. The order wa s often repeated, and still no t obeyed. The ki ng fle w into a ra ge and ordered the same man to ho ld the minister, an d it was immediately done. The minister laughed and said that th e incident was the explanation required by the king. ‘Ho w?’ asked the king. Th e minister re plied, ‘Th e order was th e same an d the executor als o, but the authority was differ ent. When I or dered, the eff ect was n il, whereas, when you ordered, there was immediate eff ect. Similarly with mantras. Q: I am taught that mantra j apa is ve ry potent in practice.

Renunciation does not imply apparent divesting o f costumes, family ties, home, et c., but renunciation of desires, aff ection and attachment. There is no need to resi gn your job, only resign yourself to God, the bearer o f the burden of all.

Similar thoughts th at you are a sannyasi [wand ering mo nk] will haunt you, even if you go out as a sannyasi.

Your efforts ca n be made ev en now, whatever t he environment. Q: Is it possible to e njoy samad hi [awar eness of r eality] while b usy in worl dly work? A: The feeling ‘I wo rk’ is the hi ndrance. As k yourself ‘Who wor ks?’ Remember who you are. Then the w ork will not bi nd you, it will go on automatically . Make no effort eith er to wor k or to re nounce; it is your effort which is the bondage. What is de stined to ha ppen will ha ppen. If you are destined not to w ork, wor k cannot be had even if you hunt for it. If you are destined to work, you will no t be able to av oid it and you will be forced to engage yourself in it. So, lea ve it to the hi gher power; you cannot renounce or r etain as you choose. Q: Bhagavan sai d yesterday that while on e is en gaged in se arch of Go d ‘within’, ‘o uter’ wo rk wo uld go on automatically. In the life of Sri Chaitanya it is said th at during his le ctures to students h e was really seeking Kris hna within a nd he forgot all ab out his body and went on talking o f Krishna only. This raise s a doubt as to whether w ork can safely be left to itself. Should o ne keep part of one’s att ention on the physical wor k? A: The Self is all. Are you apart from the Self? Or can the wo rk go on without the Self? The Self is uni versal so all actions will go on whether you strain yourself to b e engaged in th em or no t. The w ork will go on of itself. Thus Krish na tol d Arjuna that he need not trouble to kill th e Kauravas because they were already slain by God. It wa s not for him to res olve t o work and worry himself about it, but to allow his o wn nature to c arry out the will of th e higher power. Q: But th e wor k may suffer if I do not atte nd to it. A: Attending to the Self means att ending to t he wor k. Because you ide ntify yourself with the b ody, you think that work is done by you. But th e body and its activities, including that wo rk, are n ot apart from the Self. What do es it matter whether you attend to the wo rk or n ot? When you walk from one place to another you do not atte nd to th e steps you take and yet you find yourself aft er a time at your goal.

Q: How can my mind b e still if I have to use it more than other people? I want to g o into solitud e and renounce my headmast er’s wor k.

A: Renunciation is always in the mind, no t in going to f orests or s olitary places or giving u p one’s duties. Th e main thing is to see that the mind do es not turn outward but inw ard. It does not r eally rest with a man whether he goes to this pl ace or that or wh ether he g ives up his duties or not. All these events ha ppen according to destiny. All the acti vities that th e body is to g o through are determined wh en it first comes int o existence. It does not rest with you to accept or reject them. The o nly freedom you have is to tur n your mind inw ard an d renounce activities th ere.

For instance, don’t our books say that it is helpful to go on pilgrimage s to sacred shrines or to ge t sat-sanga? A: Who s aid th ey are not helpful? Only such thin gs do not rest with you, whereas turning your mind inw ard does. Many people desire the pil grimage or s at-sanga that you mentio n, but do they all get it ? Q: Why is it that turning inwar d alone is left to us a nd not any outer thi ngs? A: If you want to g o to fundamentals, you must en quire wh o you are and find o ut wh o it is wh o has freedom or destiny. Who are you and why did you get this bo dy that h as these limitations? Q: Is solit ude necessary for vichara? A: There is solitud e everywhere. The individual is solitary always. His business is to fin d it out within, no t to seek it outside h imself. Solitud e is in the mind of man. On e might be in th e thick of the w orld an d maintai n serenity of mind. Suc h a on e is in solitude. An other may stay in a forest, bu t still be unable to control his mind. Such a man ca nnot be s aid to be in solitu de. Solitud e is a function of the mind. A man atta ched to de sires c annot ge t solitude wherever h e may be, whereas a detached man is alw ays in solitud e. Q: So th en, on e might be engaged in w ork and be free from desire a nd keep up solitu de. Is it so? A: Yes. Work performed with atta chment is a s hackle, wh ereas wor k perf ormed with d etachment do es not affect the doer. On e who works like this is, even whil e working, in s olitud e. Q: Our everyday life is no t comp atible with su ch efforts. A: Why do you think you are active? Take the gross ex ample o f your arriv al here. You left hom e in a ca rt, took a train, alig hted at the railw ay statio n here, got into a cart th ere an d found yourself in this as hram.

J ust as those mov ements ar e confounded with your ow n, so also are the other acti vities. They are not your own, they are God’s a ctivities. Q: How can cessatio n of ac tivity [nivritti ] and peace of mind be attain ed in t he midst of household duti es whic h are of the nature of co nstant acti vity? A: As the a ctivities of th e wise man ex ist only in the eyes of others an d not in his ow n, alth ough he may be accomplis hing immense tas ks, he r eally does nothing. Th erefore his a ctivities do not st and in the way of inaction and peace of mind. For he knows the trut h that all acti vities tak e place in his mere p resence and that he does nothing.

A: The householder’s life is not a bar, but the householder must do his utmost to pr actice self- control. If a man has a strong desire for the higher life th en the sex tendency will su bside. When the mind is de stroyed, the other desires are destroyed also. Q: I have committed sexual sin. A: Even if you have, it does not matter so lo ng as you do not think aft erwar ds that you have done so. The Self is not aware of a ny sin and renunciatio n of se x is inter nal, not merely of the body alone. Q: I am carried away by the si ght of th e breasts of a youn g woman ne ighbour an d I am often tempted to c ommit adultery with her. What should I do ? A: You are alw ays pure. It is your se nses and body which tempt you and which you confuse with your real Self. So first know who is tempted an d who is th ere to tempt. But even if you do commit adultery, do not think a bout it afterwards, because you are yourself always pure. You are not the sin ner. Q: How do we root out our sex idea? A: By rooting o ut the f alse id ea of th e body being the Self. Ther e is no sex in th e Self. Be th e Self an d then you will have no sex tro ubles. Q: Can fastin g cure sexual desire? A: Yes, bu t it is temporary. Mental fast is th e real aid. Fastin g is not an end in itself. There must be spiritu al development side by side. Complete fastin g makes t he mind too w eak.

In the early days after my comin g here, I had my eyes closed and I was s o deeply absorbed in meditation th at I hardly knew whether it was day or night. I had no food and no sleep. When there is mov ement in the b ody, you need food. If you have food, you need sleep. If there is no movement, you do not need sleep. Very little food is en ough to sust ain life.

Most of these exercises can be traced back to the Y oga Sutras of Pata njali which were writte n about 2000 years ago. Pata njali’s system , known as ra ja yoga, co ntains eig ht distinctive le vels an d practices. 1 Yatna Conduct o f life in r elation to others – av oiding u ntruth, theft, injury to others, sensuality and greed. 2 Niyama Conduct towards oneself – cleanliness, tran quillity , austerity, study and devotion. 3 Asana Stretc hing, bending, bal ancing a nd sitting exercises. These exercises are n owadays collectively known as hatha yoga. 4 Pran ayama Breathing exercises w hich aim to control th e mind. 5 Pratyahara Withdrawin g the att ention from the body and the senses. 6 Dharana Concentration o f the mind. 7 Dhyana Me ditatio n. 8 Samad hi Uninterrupted c ontemplation o f reality. Most of th ese pr actices can be found in other spiritual systems. The only exceptions are hatha yoga a nd pranayama and it is these w hich give raja yoga its disti nctive character. When visitors as ked Sri Rama na about these practices h e would us ually criticise ha tha yoga b ecause of its obsession with th e body. It is a fundame ntal premise of h is teachings that spiritual pr oblems ca n only be solved by controlling th e mind, and because of this, he never encouraged the practice of spiritu al discipli nes whi ch devoted themsel ves primarily to the well-bei ng of the body. He had a higher opinion of pr anayama (breath control), saying that it was a us eful ai d for tho se wh o could not otherwis e control their mind, but on the w hole he tended to re gard it as a beginner’s p ractice. His vie ws on the other as pects of raja yoga (su ch as morality, meditati on and samadhi) ha ve been dealt with in separate ch apters. In addition to ra ja yoga th ere is another popular system called kundalini yoga. The practition ers of this system concentrate on psychic ce ntres (c hakras) i n the body in order to ge nerate a spiritual po wer they call ku ndalini. The aim of this p ractice is to force the k undalini up a psychic channel (the s ushumna) whi ch runs from the b ase of the s pine t o the brain. Th e kundalini yogi believes that wh en this power rea ches the s ahasrara (the highest chakra located in t he brain), Self-r ealization will result. Sri Rama na never advised his devotees to p ractise ku ndalini yoga since he regarded it as being bo th potentially dangerous an d unnecessary. He ac cepted the e xistence of the k undalini power and the chakras but he said that ev en if the kundalini reached the sahasrara it would not result in realization. For final re alizati on, he s aid, the k undalini must go beyond th e sahasrara, do wn another na di (psychic nerve) he called amrita nadi (also ca lled th e paranadi or j ivanadi) and into the He art- centre on the rig ht-hand side of t he chest. Since h e maintain ed that self-en quiry would automatically send the kundalini to the He art-ce ntre, he taught that se parate yoga ex ercises wer e unnecessary. The Self is rea ched by the search for th e origi n of th e ego and by diving into t he He art. This is th e direct meth od of Self-realiz ation. One wh o adopts it need not worry about nadis, the brain ce ntre [sah asrara], the sushumna, the paranadi, th e kundalini, pranayama or the si x centres [cha kras]. In addition to the p ractices ou tlined above, Hinduism contains an other yoga calle d karma yoga, the yoga of ac tion. Practition ers of this system aim to evolve spiritu ally by selflessly serving a nd assistin g others. Although it is sp oken of highly in the Bh agavad Gita, Sri Rama na generally discouraged his devotees from following this p ath since it presupposes the existence of an ‘I’ wh o is going to p erform the g ood deeds and ‘other pe ople’ wh o are in n eed of assistance.

Q: Yoga means union. I wonder union of what with what? A: Exactly. Yoga implies prior di vision and it mea ns later un ion of one thin g with an other. But who is to b e united and with wh om? You are th e seeker, seeking u nion with somet hing. If you assume this the n that s omethin g must be apart from you. But your Self is intimate to you and you are alw ays aware of it.

A: Find out t o whom is the viyoga. That is yoga. Yoga is common to all paths. Yoga is really nothing but ceasing to think that you are diff erent fr om the Self or re ality. All th e yogas -k arma, jnana, bhakti an d raja – are just different paths to suit diff erent natures with diff erent modes of e volution. They are all aimed at getti ng people out of the lo ng- cherished notion that th ey are differ ent from the Self. There is no question of un ion or yoga in the sense of going and joining somet hing that is somewh ere away from us or differ ent from us, because you never were or co uld be separate from the Self. Q: What is the differ ence between yoga an d enquiry? A: Yoga enjoins chitta-v ritti-nirodha [repres sion o f thoughts] whereas I prescribe atma nveshana [quest of oneself]. This latter metho d is more practicable. The mind is re pressed in sw oon, or as th e effe ct of fastin g. But as soon as the cause is with drawn th e mind r evives, that is, the thoughts be gin to flow as b efore. There are just two ways of controllin g the mind. Either s eek its source, or surrender it to be struck down by the supreme po wer. Surrender is the recognitio n of the e xistence of a higher o verruling power. If the mind ref uses t o help in seeking the source, let it go and wait for its retur n; the n turn it inwar ds. No o ne succeeds with out pa tient pe rseverance. Q: Is it necessary to control one’s breath? A: Breath control is only an aid for di ving deep withi n oneself. On e may as well di ve down by controlling th e mind. When th e mind is co ntrolled, th e breath is controlled automatically . One need not attempt br eath c ontrol, mind c ontrol is enough. Bre ath co ntrol is only recommend ed for those who cannot control their minds strai ghtaway. Q: When s hould on e do pranayama and why is it effective? A: In the a bsence of e nquiry and devotion, the natural s edative pr anayama [breat h regulatio n] may be tried. This is known as yoga marga [the pat h of yoga]. If life is imperiled th e whole inter est centres ro und one point, the saving of life. If the breath is hel d the mind c annot aff ord to (and does not) jump at its pets -ext ernal objects. Thus th ere is rest for the mind so long as t he breath is he ld. All attentio n being turned on breath or its re gulati on, oth er inter ests are lost. The source of b reath is the same as that of th e mind. Therefore th e subsidence of eith er leads eff ortlessly to the subsidence of th e other. Q: Will concentratio n on chakras quieten the mind? A: Fixing their minds on psychic centres such as the sahasrara [the tho usand-petalled lot us chakra], yogis remain any length of time without awareness of th eir bodies. As lo ng as this state co ntinues they appear to be immersed in some 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman kind of j oy. But when the mind w hich has become tran quil emerg es and becomes active again it resumes its worl dly thoughts. It is therefore ne cessary to train it with the help of p ractices like d hyana [meditation] whenever it be comes externalised. It will then attain a state i n which there is neither subsidence nor emergence. Q: Is the mind control ind uced by pranayama also tempor ary? A: Quiescence lasts only so long as the b reath is controlled. So it is transient. The goal is clearly not pranayama. It extends on to pratyahara [withdr awal], dharana [con centratio n of mind], dhyana [meditation] and sama dhi. Tho se stages de al with co ntrol of the mind. Suc h mind control be comes e asier f or a person who has earlier pr actise d pranayama. Pranayama therefore le ads on e to the higher st ages. Because these higher sta ges in volve controlling th e mind, one can say that mind co ntrol is th e ultimate aim of yoga. A more ad vanced man will naturally go direct to co ntrol of mind with out w asting h is time in pr actisin g control of breath. Q: Pranayama has three phases – e xhalation, inhalation and retention. Ho w should they be regulated? A: Completely giving up identificatio n with the b ody alone is exhalation [recha ka]; mergin g within thr ough the enquiry ‘Who am I? ’ along is inhalation [pur aka]; abiding as the one reality ‘I am th at’ alone is retention [kumbh aka]. This is the re al pranayama. Q: I find it said in Maha Y oga that in th e beginning of meditatio n one may attend to th e breath, that is, its ins piratio n and expiration, an d that after a ce rtain amo unt of stillne ss of mind is attained, on e can dive int o the He art seeking the source of the mind. I ha ve been badly in want of some such practical hint. Can I follo w this method? Is it correct? A: The thi ng is to kill the mind some how. Th ose w ho have not t he stre ngth t o follow th e enquiry method are advised to adopt pranayama as a h elp to c ontrol the mind. This pr anayama is of two k inds, controlling a nd regulatin g the breath, or simply watching the breath. Q: For co ntrolling th e breath, is not the ratio 1:4: 2 for in haling, retaining the breath an d exhaling b est? A: All th ose proportio ns, sometimes regulated not by counting b ut by uttering mantras, ar e aids to c ontrolling th e mind. That is all. Watchin g the b reath is also one form of pranayama. Inhaling, retai ning a nd exhaling is more violent and may be harmful in some c ases, for example wh en there is no proper G uru to g uide the s eeker at ev ery step and stage. But merely watching the breath is easy and involves no risk. Q: Is the manifestatio n of ku ndalini sakti [kun dalini po wer] possible on ly for th ose who follow th e yogic pa th of acquiring sakti [power], or is it possible als o for tho se wh o follow t he pat h of de votion [bhakti] or love [prema]? A: Who d oes not have kundalini sa kti? When th e real nat ure of that sa kti is known, it is call ed akhandakara vritti [unbroken consciousness] or aham sp hurana [effulgence of ‘I’]. Kundalini sa kti is there for all pe ople whatever pa th they follow. It is only a differ ence in nam e. Q: It is said th at the sakti manifests itself in five p hases, te n phases, a h undred phases and a thousand phases. Which is true: fiv e or te n or a hu ndred or a thousand? A: Sakti has only one phase. If it is sai d to manifest itself in se veral phases, it is only a way of speaking. Th e sakti is only one. Q: Can a jn ani help not o nly those who follow his p ath but also others wh o follow ot her paths such as yoga? A: Undoubtedly. He can help people whatever path th ey choose to follow. It is somethin g like this. Sup pose there is a hill. There will be v ery many paths to climb it. If he were to a sk people to climb by the way he came, some ma y like it and some may not. If people who do not like it are asked to climb by that path, an d by that path only, they will not be able to come u p. Hence a jnani helps people followi ng any particular path, whatever it ma y be. Pe ople w ho are midway may not know about the merits an d demerits of o ther p aths, but one who has climbed t o the summit and sits there observing others coming up is ab le to se e all the paths. He will ther efore be able to tell pe ople who are c oming up to move a little to this sid e or that or t o avoid a pitf all. The g oal is th e same for all. 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Q: How can one direct the p rana or life-for ce into the sushumna na di [a psychic n erve in the s pine] so that the chit- jada-granthi [the ide ntificatio n of co nsciousness with th e body] can be severed i n the man ner state d in Sri Rama na Gita? A: By enquiring ‘Who am I?’ The yogi may be definitely aiming at r ousing the kundalini an d sending it up the sushumna. The jnani may not b e having this as his object. But bot h achieve the same res ults, that of sending the life- force up the sushumna an d severing th e chit-j ada-granthi. Kundalini is only another name for atma or Self or sa kti. We talk of it as being insi de the body, because we co nceive ourselves as limited by this body. But it is in reality both insi de and outside, being no t different from Self or th e sakti of Self. Q: How to ch urn up the nadis [ps ychic ne rves] so that the kundalini may go up the sushumna? A: Though the yogi may have his meth ods of b reath co ntrol for t his object, the jnani’s metho d is only that of e nquiry. When by this metho d the mind is merge d in the Self, the sakti or kundalini, whi ch is not a part fr om the Self, rises automatically. The yogis attach the hi ghest importa nce to s ending the kundalini u p to th e sahasrara, the brain ce ntre o r the thousand- petalled l otus. They point out the script ural stateme nt that the life-c urrent ent ers the b ody through the fontanelle an d argue that, viyoga [separatio n] having come a bout that way, yoga [union] must also be effected in the re verse way. Therefore, they say, we must by yoga practice ga ther u p the pranas and enter the fontanelle for th e consummation of yoga. The jnanis on the other ha nd point out that the yogi assumes th e existence of th e body and its separateness fr om the Self. Only if this sta ndpoint of separateness is adopted can the yogi ad vise e ffort for re union by the practice of yoga. In fact the body is in the mind whi ch has the brain for its seat. That th e brain functions by light borrowed from another source is admitted by the yogis themselv es in their fo ntanelle th eory. The jnani further argues: if the lig ht is borrowed it must come fr om its native source. Go to the s ource dir ect an d do not depend on borrowed resources. Th at source is the Heart, the Self. The Self do es not come fr om anywher e else an d enter th e body through the crown o f the head. It is as it is, ever sparkling, ever steady, unmo ving and unchanging. The individual co nfines himself to th e limits of the changeful b ody or of the mind whi ch derives its existence from the unchanging Self. All that is necessary is to give up this mistake n identity, and that do ne, the ever-shining Self will be seen to be the single no n-dual re ality. If one concentrates on the sahasrara there is no doubt that the e cstasy of samadhi en sues. The v asanas, that is the late nt mental te ndencies, are not however destroyed. The yogi is therefore b ound to wake up from the samad hi because release from bondage has not yet been accomplish ed. He must still try to eradicate th e vasanas in herent in him so that th ey cease to distur b the p eace of his samad hi. So he passes down from the sahasrara to th e Heart through what is call ed the jivanadi, whi ch is only a continuation of th e sushumna. The sushumna is thus a curve. It starts from the lowest chakra, rises t hrough the spi nal co rd to th e brai n and from there bends down and ends in t he He art. When th e yogi has reached the Heart, th e samadhi becomes permane nt. Thus we s ee that the He art is the final ce ntre. Q: Hatha yogic pra ctices are said to ba nish diseases e ffectively and are therefor e advocated as n ecessary preliminaries to jnana yoga. A: Let those who advocate them use them. It has not been the experience here. All di seases will be effectively annihilated by continuous self-e nquiry. If you proceed on the notion th at health of bo dy is necessary for health of mind, there will ne ver be an end to th e care of the b ody. Q: Is not hatha yoga ne cessary for the e nquiry into the Self? A: Each one finds some one metho d suitable to himself, because of lat ent tendencies [purva s amskar a].

Why all the se only to kn ow oneself? The truth is th at from the Self the ego rises up, confuses itself with t he body, mistak es the w orld to be real, an d then, co vered wit h egotistic co nceit, it thin ks wildly and looks for as anas [seats]. Such a p erson do es not understand that he himself is the centre o f all and thus forms the basis for all. The a sana [seat] is mea nt to make him sit firm. Where an d how can he remain firm except in his ow n real state? This is the real asana; Attaini ng the steadiness of no t swerving fr om the knowledge that the b ase [asana] upon whi ch the whole un iverse rests is on ly Self, which is the space of true k nowledge, the illustrious g round, alone is the firm and motionl ess posture [asana] for excellent samadhi. Q: In what as ana is Bhagavan usually seated? A: In what asana? In the a sana of th e Heart. Where ver it is pleasant, ther e is my asana. That is called sukhasana, the asana of happiness. That asana of the He art is peaceful, and gives happiness. There is no need for any other asana for th ose w ho are seated in that on e. Q: The Gita seems to emp hasise karma yoga, for Arjuna is persuaded to fight. Sri Krishna himself set the example by an active life of great ex ploits. A: The Gita starts by saying that you are not the body and that you are not therefore the karta [the doer]. Q: What is the significa nce? A: It mea ns that on e should ac t without thinking that oneself is the a ctor. Acti ons will go on even in the e goless state.

Many gradations a nd subdivisions of samadhi have been described, with differ ent sc hools an d religions each tending to produce their ow n distin ctive ca tegories a nd terminolo gy. The cl assific ation g enerally used by Sri Raman a divides th e various samadhis int o the f ollowin g three-fold d ivision: 1 Sah aja nirvikalpa sama dhi This is the st ate of th e jnani who has finally and irrevocably eliminated hi s ego. Sahaja means ‘natural’ an d nirvikalpa mean s ‘no diff erences’. A jnani in this st ate is able to function n aturally in the world, just as a ny ordinary person does. Knowing th at he is th e Self, the s ahaja jnani sees no difference between himself and others an d no difference between himself an d the worl d. For su ch a person, ev erything is a manifest ation of t he indivisible Self. 2 Kevala nirvikalpa samad hi This is the sta ge below Self-re alizatio n. In this state th ere is a temp orary but effortless Self-aw areness, bu t the ego has not been finally eliminate d. It is characterise d by an absence of body-consciousness. Although on e has a temp orary awareness of th e Self in this st ate, one is not able to pe rceive s ensory information o r function in the w orld. When bo dy-consciousness retur ns, the e go reappears. 3 Savi kalpa sama dhi In this stat e Self-a wareness is maint ained by constant effort. The c ontinuity of the sama dhi is wh olly dependent on the effort pu t in to maintain it. When Self-att ention wavers, Self-aw areness is ob scured. The followin g brief d efinitio ns formulat ed by Sri Raman a should be sufficie nt to guide the uninitiated thr ough the terminolo gical jungle of sama dhi: 1 Hol ding on to reality is samad hi. 2 Hol ding on to reality with eff ort is savikalpa samad hi. 3 Mer ging in r eality and remaini ng unaware o f the wo rld is nirvikalpa samad hi. 4 Mer ging in i gnorance and remainin g unaware of the w orld is sle ep. 5 Remaini ng in th e primal, pure, na tural state witho ut effort is sa haja nirvikalpa samadhi. Q: What is samadhi ? A: The stat e in which the u nbroken experience of existence-consciousness is attai ned by the still mind, alo ne is samadhi. That still mind whi ch is ad orned with the attai nment of th e limitless supreme Self, al one is th e reality of God. When th e mind is in c ommunion wit h the Self in darkness, it is call ed nidra [sleep], that is, the immersion of th e mind in ignorance. Immersion i n a conscious or wakeful stat e is called samadhi. Samadhi is co ntinuous inherence in the Self in a wa king state. Nidr a or sleep is also i nherence in th e Self but in an unconscious state. In sa haja samadhi the communi on is co ntinuous. Q: What are kevala nirvikalpa sama dhi an d sahaja nirvikalpa samad hi? A: The immersion of th e mind in the Self, but with out its destruction, is kevala nir vikalpa sama dhi. In this stat e one is not free from vasanas and so one does not therefore attain mukti. Only after the v asanas have been destroyed can one attain liberatio n. Q: When c an one practise sa haja samadhi ? A: Even from the beginning. Even though one practises ke vala nirvikalpa sama dhi for years together, if one has not rooted o ut the vasanas one will not attai n liberati on. 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Q: May I have a cle ar ide a of th e difference betw een savikalpa and nirvikalpa? A: Holding on to th e supreme state is samad hi. When it is with eff ort due to mental disturbances, it is savikalpa. When these dist urbances are absent, it is nir vikalpa. Remaini ng permane ntly in the primal state without effort is sa haja. Q: Is nir vikalpa sama dhi ab solutely necessary before the attai nment of sa haja? A: Abiding perman ently in any of these samad his, either s avikalpa or nir vikalpa, is sahaja [the natural state]. What is body-consciousness? It is the ins entient body plus consciousness. Bot h of these must lie in a nother consciousness which is ab solute an d unaffected and which remains a s it always is, with or with out th e body-consciousness. What does it then matter w hether the b ody- consciousness is lost or ret ained, provided one is ho lding on to that pu re consciousness? Total absence of b ody-consciousness h as the advantage of maki ng the samadhi more i ntense, although it makes no difference to th e knowledge of the s upreme. Q: Is sama dhi th e same as turiya, the fourth stat e? A: Samadhi, turiya and nirvikalpa all have the same implication, th at is, aw areness o f the Self. Turiya literally mean s the fourth stat e, the supreme co nsciousness, as distin ct from the other thre e states: wa king, dreaming an d dreamless sl eep. Th e fourth state is eter nal an d the other thre e states c ome and go in it. In turiya there is the awareness that th e mind has merg ed in its so urce, the He art, and is quiescent there, although some tho ughts still imping e on it an d the s enses are still somew hat acti ve. In nir vikalpa the senses ar e inactive a nd thoughts are totally absent. Hence the e xperience of pure consciousness in this stat e is intense and blissf ul. Turiya is obt ainable in savikalpa s amadhi. Q: What is the differ ence between the bliss en joyed in sl eep and the bliss e njoyed in turiya? A: There are not differ ent bliss es. There is only one bliss whic h incl udes the blis s enjoyed in th e waking stat e, the bliss of all ki nds of beings fr om the lowest an imal to the highest Brahma. That bliss is the blis s of the Self. The bliss which is en joyed u nconsciously in sleep is enjoyed consciously in turiya, that is the only difference. Th e bliss en joyed in the waking stat e is second- hand, it is an adjunct of the r eal bliss [upa dhi an anda]. Q: Is sama dhi, the ei ghth stage of raja yoga, the s ame as the sama dhi you speak of? A: In yoga the term samadhi refers to some ki nd of trance and there ar e various ki nds of samad hi. But the sama dhi I speak of is different. It is sa haja samadhi. From here you have samadh ana [steadiness] and you remai n calm and composed even while you are acti ve. Yo u realiz e that you are mov ed by the deeper re al Self withi n. You have no worries, no anxieties, no cares, for you come to r ealize t hat ther e is nothing b elonging to you. You kn ow that everything is done by somethi ng with w hich you are in c onscious union. Q: If this sa haja samadhi is the most d esirable co ndition, is ther e no need for nir vikalpa s amadhi ? A: The nir vikalpa s amadhi of r aja yoga may have its use. But in jnana yoga this sahaja sthiti [natural stat e] or sahaja nishtha [abid ance in th e natural state] itself is th e nirvikalpa state. In this na tural state the mind is fre e from doubts. It has no need to swi ng between alter natives of p ossibilities and probabilities. It sees no vikalpas [differe nces] of any kind. It is sure of th e truth be cause it feels the presence of th e real. Even when it is active, it knows it is active i n the reality, the Self, the supreme being. Q: What is the differ ence between deep sleep, laya [a trance-lik e state in whi ch the mind is temp orarily in abeyanc e] and sama dhi? A: In deep sleep the mind is merge d and not d estroyed. That whi ch merg es rea ppears. It ma y happen in medit ation also. But the mind whi ch is de stroyed cannot re appear. The yogi’s aim must be to destroy it and not to sink into laya. In the peace of meditatio n, laya sometimes ensues but it is not enough. It must be supplement ed by other pr actices for destroying the mind. Some pe ople have gone into yogic samadhi with a triflin g thought and after a lo ng time awakened in th e trail of the same th ought. In th e meantime generations ha ve passed in the w orld. Suc h a yogi ha s not destroyed his mind. The true d estruction of the mind is th e non-recognitio n of it as being apart from the Self. Even now the mind is no t. Recognise it. How can you do it if not in e veryday activities whi ch go on automatically? 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Know th at the mind pr omoting th em is not real but is on ly a phantom proceeding from the Self. That is how th e mind is destroyed. Q: Can the meditat or be a ffected by physical distur bances during n irvikalpa samadhi? My friend and I disagree on this po int. A: Both of you are rig ht. One of you is referring to ke vala and the other to sahaja sama dhi. In bo th cases the mind is immersed in the blis s of the Self. In the f ormer, physical mov ements ma y cause disturbance to th e meditator, be cause the mind h as not compl etely died out. It is still alive and can, as aft er deep sleep, at any moment be a ctive again. It is compared to a bu cket, which, although compl etely submerg ed under wat er, can be pulled o ut by a rope whi ch is still attached to it.

Whatev er is done by such people is just incidental, th ey will never slid e down from their hig h state. Those th at are in th e kevala nirvikalpa state are not realized, they are still seekers. Tho se wh o are in the sahaja nirvikalpa state a re like a light in a win dless pl ace, or the ocean with out wa ves; that is, there is no movement in th em.

Q: Is the experience of ke vala nirvi kalpa the s ame as that of s ahaja, although on e com es down from it to the relativ e world? A: There is neither coming d own nor going up – he who goes up and down is no t real.

Q: What is the use of sama dhi an d does thought subsist th en? A: Samadhi al one can reveal the trut h. Thoughts cast a v eil over reality, and so it is not realized as s uch in states o ther than sama dhi. In sama dhi th ere is only the feeling ‘I am’ an d no thoughts. The experience of ‘I am’ is ‘being still’. Q: How can I repeat the e xperience of samad hi or th e stillness th at I obtain h ere in your pr esence? A: Your present ex perience is du e to th e influ ence of th e atmosp here in which you find yourself. Can you have it outside t his atmosp here? The e xperience is sp asmodic. Until it becomes p erman ent, pra ctice is ne cessary. Q: Is sama dhi an experience of ca lmness or p eace? A: The tra nquil clarity, which is devoid of mental turmoil, alone is the sama dhi whi ch is the firm base for liberati on. By earnestly trying to de stroy the deceptive mental turmoil, experience th at samadhi as the p eaceful consciousness which is inn er clarity. Q: What is the differ ence between inter nal an d external sama dhi? A: External samad hi is holding o n to th e reality while witnes sing the worl d, without reacting to it from withi n. There is the stillne ss of a wa veless oc ean.

Are we then undergoing all th ese te dious processes o f meditation, pu rificati on and disciplin e only to end in a stat e of terror ? Are we going to tur n into livin g corpses? A: People have all so rts of notions about nirvi kalpa. Why speak of R omain Rolland? If th ose w ho have all the Upanishads and vedantic tra dition at th eir disposal ha ve fantastic no tions about nirvikalpa, wh o can blame a w esterner for similar notions? Some yogis by breathing exercises all ow themsel ves to fall into a cataleptic stat e far deeper tha n dreamless sle ep, in whi ch they are aware of no thing, absolutely nothing, and they glorify it as n irvikalpa.

Still others take nirvikalpa to be attainable only through a tra nce in w hich the wo rld-co nsciousness is totally obliterat ed, as in a faintin g fit. All this is due to th eir viewing it intellect ually. Nirvikalpa is chit – eff ortless, formless co nsciousness. Where do es the terror com e in, and where is the mystery in being oneself? To some people whose minds ha ve become rip e from a long practice in th e past, nir vikalpa com es suddenly as a flo od, bu t to others it comes in the c ourse of th eir spiritual practice, a practice w hich slowly wears d own the obstructing thoughts an d reveals the scr een of pure awareness ‘I’-’I’. Furth er practice re nders the s creen permane ntly exposed. This is Self-re alizatio n, mukti, or sahaja samad hi, the natural, eff ortless stat e. Mere non- perception of the diff erences [vikalp as] outside is no t the real nature of firm nirvikalpa. Kn ow that th e non-risin g of differences [vikal pas] in the dead mind al one is the tru e nirvikalpa. Q: When th e mind begins to s ubside int o the Self ther e is often a sensation of fear. A: The fear and the q uaking of on e’s body while on e is entering s amadhi is due to th e slight e go-consciousness still remaini ng.

Q: Is sama dhi a blissf ul or ec static stat e? A: In sama dhi itself there is only perfect pe ace. Ecstasy comes wh en the mind re vives at t he end of samadhi, with th e remembra nce of the peace of samadhi. In d evotion the ecstasy comes first. It is manif ested by tears of joy, hair sta nding on end and vocal stumbling. When the e go finally dies and the sahaja is won, these symptoms and the e cstasies ce ase. Q: On realisin g samad hi, does not o ne obtain sid dhis [sup ernatural po wers] also? A: In order to dis play siddhis, there must be others to re cognise them. That means, ther e is no jnana in the o ne who displays them. Therefore, sid dhis ar e not wo rth a th ought. Jn ana alone is to be aime d at and gained. Q: It is stated in the Man dukyopanis had that un less samadhi, th e eighth an d last sta ge of yoga, is also ex perienced, there can be no liberatio n [moksha] however muc h meditation [dhyana] or physical austerities [tapas] are performed.

Th at which is steady, continuous like the flow of oil, is austerity, medit ation an d absorption. To b e one’s own Self is samadhi.

Both of th ese effects c an be deliberately produced. Concentratio n on a mental image will sometimes result in visi ons, pa rticularly if the concentration is do ne with devotion or if there is a stro ng desire for the visi ons to a ppear. Psychic powers (sid dhis) may also be attained by special yogic ex ercises. Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, the cl assic te xt on yoga, lists several ex ercises whi ch accelerate the development of eight siddhis ra nging from invisi bility to walking on water. Sri Rama na dis couraged his devotees from deli berately pursuing eit her visi ons or siddhis by pointing o ut that th ey were products of th e mind which might impe de rat her th an facilitate Self- re alizati on. If visions came sp ontaneously he would sometimes admit that they were a sign of progress but he would us ually add that th ey were only tempor ary experiences in th e mind an d that th ey were ‘b elow th e plane of Self-re alizatio n’.

Without Siva th ere is no life in w hat I se e around me. I am so happy to thi nk of him. Please tell me how his v ision may be everlasting to me. A: You speak of a vision of Siva. Visio n is always of an object. That implies the existence of a subject. The v alue of the vision is the same as th at of the s eer. That is to say, the nature o f the visi on is on the same plane as th at of the seer. Appearance implies dis appearance al so. Whatev er appears must als o disappear. A visi on can never be eternal. But Siva is eter nal. The v ision implies th e seer. Th e seer cannot deny the existence of th e Self. Ther e is no moment wh en the Self as consciousness do es not exi st, nor can the s eer remain a part from consciousness. This co nsciousness is the et ernal being and the only being. The s eer ca nnot see himself. Does he deny his ex istence because he cannot see himself with the eyes as in a visi on? No. So pratyaksh a [direct experience] does not mea n seeing, but bei ng.

Even if God should appear in that form, how is the disciple’s ig norance wip ed out? The truth must be et ernal realization. Th e direct perception is ever-present ex perience.

Q: Does the sage use occult po wers for makin g others realiz e the Self, or is the mere fa ct of his Self-reali zation enough for it? A: The for ce of his Self- realization is far more p owerful tha n the u se of all other powers. Though sid dhis ar e said to be many and differ ent, jn ana alone is the highest of those many different siddhis, because those wh o have attained other sid dhis will de sire jn ana. Those wh o have attained jnana will no t desire other siddhis. Therefore aspire only for jn ana. Although the powers ap pear to be wonderful to th ose wh o do not p ossess th em, yet they are only transient. It is useless to a spire for that whi ch is tra nsient. All these wonders are contained in th e one changeless Self. Greedily begging for wo rthless o ccult powers [siddhis] from God, who will re adily give himself, wh o is everything, is like b egging for wort hless st ale gr uel from a generous-n atured p hilanthropist wh o will readily give everything.

These can exist only so long as th ere ar e the s ubject and object. For wh om are these two again? On in vestigation you will find that th ey resolve into th e subject only. See wh o is the subject and this en quiry will lead you to pure consciousness beyond th e subject. You say ‘normal self: th e normal self is the mind. The mind is with limitations.

First the e go arises an d sees objects as external. If the ego does not rise, the Self alone exi sts and there is nothing e xternal. For anything ext ernal to oneself implies the e xistence of the s eer within. See king it there will eliminat e doubt and fear. Not only fear, all ot her th oughts ce ntred round the e go will disappear al ong with it. Q: How can the terri ble fe ar of death be overcome? A: When does that fear sei ze you? Does it com e when you do not see your body, say, in dreamless sleep? It haunts you only when you are f ully ‘awake’ and perceive the w orld, incl uding your body. If you do not see these and remain your pure Self, as in dr eamless sle ep, no fear can touch you. If you trac e this fear t o the object, the loss of whi ch gives rise to it, you will find that that ob ject is not t he body, but the mind w hich functions in it.

Q: When I try to be witho ut all thoughts, I pass into sleep. What sh ould I do about it? A: Once you go to sle ep you can do nothing in th at state. But while you are awake, try to keep away all thoughts. Why think about sleep? Even that is a thought, is it not? If you are able to be witho ut any thought while you are awake, that is enough. When you pass into sleep the stat e which you were in be fore falling asl eep will co ntinue when you wake up. You will continue from where you left off when you fell int o slumber. So long as there ar e thoughts of activity there will also be sleep. Thought and sleep are counterparts of on e and the same thi ng. We should not sl eep too muc h or go without it alto gether, but sleep only moderately. To prevent too muc h sleep, we must try and have no thoughts or c halana [movement o f the mind], we must eat only sattvic fo od and that only in moder ate meas ure, an d not indulge i n too muc h physical activity. The more we control thought, acti vity and food the more we s hall be a ble to c ontrol slee p. But mod eratio n ought to b e the r ule, as explained in the Gita, for th e seeker o n the path. Sleep is the first ob stacle, as explained in the books, for all sa dhaks. Th e second obstacle is said to be vikshepa or the sense objects of th e worl d which divert on e’s att ention. The third is sai d to be kashaya or thoughts in the mind ab out previous experiences with sense objects. The fourth, an anda [bliss], is als o calle d an obstacle, be cause in that stat e a feeling of s eparatio n from the source of a nanda, enabling the e njoyer to say ‘I am enjoying an anda’, is pr esent. Even this h as to be surmo unted. The fi nal stag e of sama dhi ha s to be reached in whi ch one becomes an anda or one with re ality. In this state the duality of enjoyer an d enjoyment ceases in the ocean of sat-chit-a nanda or th e Self. Q: So on e should not try to perpetuate blis sful or ec static stat es? A: The fin al obstacle in medit ation is ec stasy; you feel gr eat bliss a nd happiness an d want to stay in that ec stasy. Do not yield to it but p ass on to th e next stag e which is gre at calm. The calm is higher than ecstasy and it merge s into samadhi. Successful samadhi c auses a w aking sleep state t o supervene. In that state you know that you are alw ays consciousness, for consciousness is your nat ure. Act ually, one is alw ays in samadhi b ut one does not know it. To know it all one has to do is to remo ve the obstacles. Q: Through poetry, music, japa, bhajans [dev otional songs], the si ght of b eautiful lan dscapes, reading the line s of spiritu al verses, etc., one experiences sometimes a tru e sense of th e all- pervading unity. Is that feeling of deep blissful quiet in whi ch the personal self ha s no place the same a s the entering into th e Heart of which Bha gavan speaks? Will undertaking these activities le ad to a d eeper samadhi an d so ultimatel y to a full visi on of th e real? A: There is happiness wh en agreeable thi ngs ar e presented to th e mind. It is the h appiness in herent in the Self, an d there is no other happiness. An d it is not alien and afar. Yo u are diving into th e Self on those oc casions whic h you consider pl easurable an d that di ving results in self-exi stent bliss. But th e association of id eas is res ponsible for foistin g that blis s on other thi ngs or occurrences whil e, in fact, that bliss is within you. On thes e occasions you are pl unging into th e Self, though unconsciously. If you do so consciously, with th e conviction th at comes of t he experience that you are identical with th e happiness w hich is truly the Self, the one reality, you call it realization. I wa nt you to dive consciously into t he Self, that is the Heart. Q: I have been makin g sadhana for nearly twenty years and I can see no progress. What should I do? From about five o’clock every morning I co ncentrate on the th ought th at the Self alone is real a nd all els e unreal. Alth ough I ha ve been doing this for about tw enty years I cannot concentrate f or more than two or thr ee minutes with out m y thoughts wandering. A: There is no other way to succeed than to draw the mind ba ck every time it turns o utwards a nd fix it in th e Self. There is no need for meditatio n or mantra o r japa or anything of t he sort, be cause these are our real nature. All th at is needed is to gi ve up thin king of ob jects other than the Self. Meditation is no t so muc h thinking o f the Self as giving u p thinking of the n ot-Self.

At times there is illumination a nd then contemplatio n is easy. At other times contemplatio n is impossi ble ev en with r epeated attempts. This is due to the wo rking of th e three gunas [sattva, ra jas and tamas]. Q: Is it influenced by one’s activities an d circumstan ces? A: Those cannot influ ence it.

Some people ca ll this a disease and some call it a test of Go d. All these pains will go if you continue your meditatio n, bestowing your thought sol ely on understanding your Self or on Self-r ealizati on. Ther e is no greater remedy than this continuous yoga o r union with Go d or atma n. Pain is inevitable as a re sult of dis carding t he vasanas [mental tendencies] which you have had for so long. Q: What is the best way of dealing with d esires and vasanas with a v iew to ge tting rid o f them satisfying them or suppressing them ? A: If a desire can be got rid of by satisfying it, ther e will be no harm in satisfying such a desire. But de sires g enerally are not eradicated by satisfa ction. Trying to root them out that way is like trying to quench a fire by pouring inflammable spirits on it. At the same time, the proper remedy is not forcible su ppression, since such repressi on is bo und to re act so oner or later i nto a for ceful surging up of de sires wit h undesirable c onsequences. The proper way to get rid of a desire is to fi nd ou t ‘Who g ets the d esire? What is its source?’ When this is fo und, the desire is rooted out and it will ne ver again emerg e or grow. Small desires such as th e desire to eat, dri nk, slee p and attend to calls o f nature, tho ugh these ma y also be classed amon g desires, you can safely satisfy. They will not implant va sanas in your mind, ne cessitatin g further birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life an d are not likely to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. As a g eneral rul e, therefore, ther e is no harm in satisfying a de sire where th e satisfaction will not le ad to f urther d esires by creating vasanas in t he mind. Q: In the practice of meditatio n are there any signs in th e realm of subjective experience whi ch will indicate the aspirant’s progress towards Self- realization?

His pri ncipal concern wa s to bring people to an awareness of th e Self and, to a chieve this end, he always insiste d that pr actice w as more importa nt than speculatio n. He discouraged questions of a theoretic al nature eith er by remainin g silent wh en they were asked or by asking the questioner to find the source of the ‘I’ that w as asking t he question. Occasionally he would relent an d give detailed e xpositions on various aspects of p hilosophy, but if his questioners pe rsisted too long with t heir qu eries, or if the conversation veered towar ds sterile int ellectualism, he would change the subject an d direct the attention of hi s questioners towards more pr actical matters. Many of these ph ilosophical co nversations centred around the nature and origin of the p hysical world sin ce Sri Raman a was k nown to h ave views which wer e totally at variance with t he common- s ense view of the wo rld. As with most other topics he tailor ed his statements to c onform to the differ ent levels of u nderstanding he encountered in his questioners, but even so, almost all hi s ideas were radical refutati ons of the concepts of physical reality that most people cherish. Sri Rama na adopted thr ee diff erent standpoints wh en he spoke about th e nature of the physical worl d. He advocated all of th em at differ ent times but it is clear from his general comments on the subject that he only considered the first two th eories given below to b e either true o r useful. 1 Ajata vada (the theory of non-causality). This is an ancient Hindu doctrine which states th at the creation of th e world never happened at all. It is a compl ete de nial of all ca usality in the p hysical world. Sri Raman a endorsed this view by saying that it is the jnani’s experience that nothing e ver comes int o existence or ce ases to be because the Self alone exists as th e sole unchanging reality. It is a c orollary of this th eory that time, space, cause and effect, ess ential components o f all creation theories, exist only in the mind s of ajnanis an d that the experience of the Self reveals th eir non-existence. This th eory is not a de nial o f the reality of the w orld, only of the creative p rocess whi ch brought it into e xistence. Speaking from his own experience Sri Raman a said that the j nani is aw are th at the worl d is real, not as an assembla ge of interacting matter and energy, but as an uncaused appearance in th e Self. He e nlarged on this by saying that because the real nature or su bstratum of this a ppearance is ide ntical with th e beingness of the Self, it necessarily partakes of its reality. That is to s ay, the w orld is not r eal to the j nani simply because it appears, bu t only because th e real nature of th e appearance is ins eparable from the Self. The a jnani, on the other hand, is totally unaware of the u nitary nature an d source of th e world a nd, as a consequence, his mind co nstructs an illusory world of separate interacting objects by persistently misinter pretin g the sense- impressio ns it receives. Sri Ramana po inted out that this vi ew of the w orld ha s no more reality than a dream since it superimpo ses a c reation of th e mind on the reality of the Self. He summarised th e differ ence between the jnani’s and the ajnani’s sta ndpoint by saying that the w orld is un real if it is perceived by the mind as a collection o f discrete objects and real wh en it is directly experienced as an appearance in th e Self. 2 Dris hti-srishti vada If his qu estioners fo und the idea of aj ata or no n-causality impos sible to as similate, he would teach them that the worl d comes int o existence simultan eously with th e appearance of the ‘I’-th ought an d that it ceases to exist w hen the ‘I’-th ought is ab sent. This th eory is known as drishti-sris hti, or simulta neous cr eation, and it says, in effe ct, that the wo rld whi ch appears to a n ajnani is a pr oduct of t he mind that pe rceives it, and that in th e absence of that mind it ceases to e xist. The theory is true in so far a s the mind do es create an imagi nary world for itself, but from the sta ndpoint of the Self, an imagin ary ‘I’ cr eating an imagi nary world is no creation at all, an d so the doctrine of ajata is not subverted. Although Sri Ramana s ometimes said that dris hti-srishti was n ot the u ltimate truth about creation he encouraged his follo wers to ac cept it as a working hypot hesis. He j ustified this ap proach by saying that if on e can consistently regard the w orld as an unreal creation o f the mind the n it loses its attracti on and it becomes easier to maintain a n undistracted awareness of t he ‘I’- thought. 3 Srishti-dris hti vada (gradual cre ation). This is th e common-se nse view w hich h olds that th e world is an objective 107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman reality governed by laws of cause and effect which can be traced back to a single act of c reation. It includes virt ually all west ern id eas on the subject from the ‘big b ang’ theory to the biblical ac count in Genesis. Sri Raman a only invoked theories of this na ture when he was talki ng to q uestioners wh o wer e unwillin g to ac cept the implicatio ns of the ajata and drishti-srishti th eories. Ev en then, he would usually point o ut that su ch theories sh ould not be taken too seriously as they were only promulgate d to satisfy intellect ual cu riosity. Literally , drishti-srishti means th at the wo rld only exists when it is perceived whereas srishti-dris hti means that the world existed pri or to anyone’ s perception of it. Although the former th eory sounds perverse, Sri Raman a insiste d that serious seekers sh ould be satisfied wit h it, partly because it is a cl ose approximation to th e truth an d partly because it is the most be neficial attitude to adopt if on e is seriously interested in re alising th e Self. Q: How has srishti [creation] come ab out? Some say it is predestined. Oth ers say it is the Lor d’s leel a or sport. What is the trut h? A: Various accounts are given in books. But is there cr eation? Only if there is cr eation do we have to explain h ow it came a bout. We may not know about all the se theories b ut we c ertainly know th at we exist. Why not k now the ‘I’ an d then see if there is a cr eation? Q: In the vedanta of Sri Sankaracharya the pri nciple of the c reation of th e worl d has been accepted for the s ake of beginners, but for th e advanced the principle of n on-creation is put forw ard. What is your view on this matter? A: ‘There is no dissolution or cr eation, no one in bondage, nor anyone pu rsuing spirit ual pra ctices. There is no one desiring lib eratio n nor anyone lib erated. This is the absolute truth.’ This slo ka appears in th e second chapter of Gaudapada’s karika. On e who is establis hed in the Self se es this by his knowledge of re ality. Q: Is not the Self the c ause of this w orld we s ee around us? A: Self itself ap pears as the wo rld of di verse names a nd forms. However, Self do es not act as the e fficient cause [nimit ta karana], creating, sustaining a nd destroying it. Do not ask ‘Wh y does the confusion of Self, not k nowing the truth th at it itself ap pears as t he worl d, arise?’ If inst ead you en quire ‘To wh om does this confusion occur?’, it will be discovered that n o such confusion ever existed for Self. Q: You seem to be an exponent of ajata doctrine of a dvaita ve danta. A: I do not teach only the ajata doctrine. I approve of all s chools. The s ame truth ha s to be e xpressed in diff erent ways to suit th e capacity of the h earer. The ajata doctrine says, ‘Nothing exists except the one reality. There is no birth o r death, no projection or dr awing in, no seeker, no bondage, no liberatio n. The one unity alone exists.’ To su ch as find it difficult to grasp this truth a nd who ask, ‘Ho w can we ignore this solid wo rld we s ee all ar ound us?’, the dream experience is poi nted out and they are told, ‘All that you see depends on the seer. Apart fr om the seer, ther e is no seen.’ This is calle d the d rishti-sris hti vada or the argument that on e first cre ates o ut of on e’s mind a nd then sees w hat one’s mind itself ha s created. Some pe ople cannot gra sp even this an d they continue to ar gue in the f ollowin g terms: ‘The d ream experience is so sh ort, while th e world al ways exists. Th e dream experience wa s limited to me. But the world is felt and seen not only by me, but by so many others. We cannot call such a w orld no n-existent.’ When people argue in this way they can be given a srishti-d rishti theory, for ex ample, ‘G od first created s uch and such a thi ng, ou t of such and such an element, an d then somet hing el se wa s created, an d so on.’ Th at alone will satisfy this cla ss. Their minds ar e otherwise no t satisfie d and they ask themselv es, ‘How c an all g eography, all maps, all sci ences, stars, planets a nd the rul es governing or relati ng to th em and all kn owledge be totally untrue?’ To su ch it is best to s ay, ‘Yes, Go d created all this an d so you see it.’ Q: But all th ese ca nnot be true. Only one doctrine can be true. A: All th ese th eories are o nly to suit the capacity of the lear ner. Th e absolute c an only be one. The v edanta says that th e cosmos s prings into vi ew simultan eously with th e seer and that ther e is no detailed process of creation. This is said to be yugapat-sris hti [instantaneous creation]. It is quite similar to the cr eations in dr eam where th e experiencer spri ngs up simultan eously with th e objects of e xperience. When this is tol d, some people are not satisfied f or they are deeply rooted in objective knowledge. They seek to fin d out how there ca n be sudden 108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman creation. They argue that a n effect must be preceded by a cause. In short, th ey desire an explanation for th e existence of the world w hich they see around them. Then the srutis [scriptures] try to satisfy their curiosity by theories of creation. This meth od of dealing with th e subject of creation is call ed krama-srishti [grad ual cre ation]. But th e true seeker can be content with yugap at-srishti, instantaneous creation. Q: What is the purpose of c reation? A: It is to gi ve rise to this q uestion. In vestigate th e answer to this q uestion, an d finally abide in the supreme or r ather the primal source of all, the Self. The investig ation will res olve itself int o a quest for th e Self and it will cease only after th e non-Self is sifted aw ay and the Self realized in its pu rity and glory. There may be any number of theories o f creation. All of them extend outwardly. There will be no limit to them because time and space are unlimited. They are however on ly in the mind. If you see the mind, time and space are transcended and the Self is realize d. Creation is ex plained scientifically or logically to on e’s own satisf action. But is there a ny finality about it? Such explanations are called krama-srishti [gradual creation]. On th e other hand, drishti-srishti [simultaneo us cre ation] is yugap at-srishti. Without th e seer th ere ar e no objects seen. Find th e seer and the creation is comprise d in him. Why look outward and go on explaining the p henomena whi ch are endless? Q: The Vedas contain co nflictin g accounts o f cosmogony. Ether is sai d to be the first creation in o ne place; vital energy [pran a] in another place; somethi ng els e in yet another; wat er in still an other, and so on . How ar e these to be reconciled? Do not the se impair the credibility of the Ve das? A: Different seers saw diff erent a spects of trut h at different times, each emp hasising o ne view. Why do you worry about their conflicting stat ements? The essential aim of the V edas is to teach us th e nature of t he imperish able atma n and show us th at we are that. Q: I am satisfied with t hat po rtion. A: Then treat all the re st as artha vada [auxiliary arguments] or expositions for th e sake of th e ignorant who seek to trace the g enesis of thi ngs. Q: I form part of th e creation a nd so remain d ependent. I cannot solve the riddle of creation u ntil I become independent. Yet I ask Sri Bhagavan, sh ould he n ot answer t he question for me? A: Yes. It is Bhagavan that says, ‘Become in dependent an d solve the riddle yourself. It is for you to do it.’ Ag ain, where ar e you now that you ask this q uestion? Are you in the worl d, or is the worl d within you? You must admit that the world is no t perceived in your sleep although you cannot de ny your existence th en. Th e world a ppears when you wake up. So where is it? Clearly the world is your thought. Th oughts ar e your pr ojections. The ‘I’ is first created a nd then the w orld. The w orld is cr eated by the ‘I’ which in its turn rises u p from the Self. The rid dle of th e creation o f the world is thus sol ved if you solve the c reation of th e ‘I’. So I say, find your Self. Again, do es the world c ome an d ask you ‘Why do ‘I’ exist? How was ‘I’ cr eated?’ It is you wh o ask the question. The questioner must est ablish th e relatio nship bet ween the w orld an d himself. He must admit that the w orld is his ow n imagin ation. Who imagines it ? Let him again find the ‘I’ an d then the Self. Moreover, all th e scie ntific an d theological e xplanations d o not harmo nise. The d iversities in such theories clearly show th e uselessness of s eeking such explanations. Suc h explanations are purely mental or intell ectual and nothing more. Still, all of th em are true according to th e standpoint of th e individual. There is no creation i n the state o f realizatio n. When one sees the wo rld, one does not see oneself. When on e sees the Self, the w orld is not s een. So se e the Self an d realize th at there has been no creation. Q: Brahman is real. Th e world [ja gat] is ‘illusio n’ is the stoc k phrase of Sri Sankaracharya. Yet oth ers say, ‘The wo rld is reality.’ Which is true? 109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman A: Both stat ements ar e true. They refer to d ifferent stages of de velopment and are spoken from different points of view. The aspirant [abhyasi] starts with the definitio n, that which is real ex ists always. Then he eliminat es the wo rld as unreal because it is changing. Th e seeker ultimately reaches the Self and there finds unity as the prevailing no te. Then, that whi ch wa s originally rejected as be ing unreal is fo und to be a part of th e unity. Being a bsorbed in th e reality, the worl d also is re al. There is only being in Self-re alizati on, an d nothing but b eing. Q: Sri Bhagavan often says that maya [illusion] and reality are the same. How ca n that be? A: Sankara was criticise d for his vi ews on maya without be ing understood. He said that (1) Brahman is real, (2) the universe is unreal, and (3) The u niverse is Bra hman. He did not st op at th e second, because the third ex plains th e other two. It signifies th at the universe is real if pe rceived as the Self, and unreal if perceived apart from the Self. Hence maya and reality are one and the same. Q: So th e world is no t really illusory? A: At the lev el of the s piritual se eker you have got to s ay that the worl d is an illusio n. There is no other way. When a man for gets th at he is Bra hman, who is re al, perman ent an d omni present, and deludes himself into thi nking that h e is a body in the u niverse w hich is filled wit h bodies that are transitory, and labours un der that de lusion, you have got to remind him that th e world is un real and a delusion. Why? Because his visi on whi ch has forgotten its own Self is dwelling in th e external, material un iverse. It will no t turn inw ards into intros pection u nless you impress on him that all this ext ernal, material un iverse is un real. When on ce he realises h is own Self he will know that th ere is nothing other tha n his ow n Self and he will come to l ook upon the whole un iverse as Br ahman. There is no universe wit hout the Self. So lo ng as a man does not see the Self which is the origi n of all, but looks only at the e xternal wo rld as re al and perma nent, you have to tell him that all this e xternal un iverse is an illusion. Yo u cannot hel p it. Take a pa per. We see only the script, and nobody notices t he paper on which t he scri pt is writte n. The paper is there wh ether the s cript on it is there or not. To th ose w ho look upon the script as real, you ha ve to say that it is unreal, an illusion, sin ce it rests up on the paper. The wise man lo oks upon both th e paper and script as o ne. So als o with Bra hman an d the universe. Q: So th e world is re al when it is experienced as the Self an d unreal when it is seen as separate names an d forms? A: Just as fire is ob scured by smoke, the shining lig ht of consciousness is obscured by the assembla ge of names an d forms, the worl d. When by compas sionate divine g race the mind b ecomes cle ar, the nature of the worl d will be known to be not the illusory forms but only the reality. Only those people whose minds a re devoid of th e evil po wer o f maya, having given up the knowledge of the w orld and being unattached to it, and having thereby attained the knowledge of th e self-s hining supreme re ality, can correctly know the meaning of th e statement ‘Th e world is re al.’ If one’s outlook has been transformed to th e nature of real knowledge, the worl d of the fi ve eleme nts beginning wit h ether [ak asa] will be real, being the s upreme reality, which is the n ature of kn owledge. The o riginal state of this empty world, whi ch is be wildering a nd crowded with many names an d forms, is blis s, which is one, just as the egg-yolk of a multi-col oured peacock is only one. Know this truth by abiding in th e state of Self. Q: I cannot say it is all clear to me. Is the w orld th at is seen, felt an d sensed by us in s o many ways somet hing like a dream, an illusio n? A: There is no alter native for you but to ac cept the w orld as u nreal if you are seeking the truth an d the truth al one. Q: Why so? A: For the simple rea son that un less you give up the idea that th e world is re al your mind will alw ays be after it. If you take the appearance to b e real you will never know th e real itself, although it is the real alone that exi sts. This 110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman point is illustrated by the analogy of the snake in the r ope. Yo u may be deceived into beli eving that a piece of ro pe is a snake. While you imagin e that the r ope is a snake you cannot see the rope as a r ope. Th e nonexistent snake becomes real to you, while the r eal ro pe seems wholly non-existent as s uch. Q: It is easy to accept tentatively that the wo rld is not ultimately real, but it is hard to h ave the conviction that it is really unreal. A: Even so is your dream world re al while you are dreaming. So lon g as th e dream lasts e verything you see and feel in it is real. Q: Is then the world n o better tha n a dr eam? A: What is wro ng with th e sense of reality you have while you are dreamin g? You may be dreaming of somet hing quite impossibl e, for instance, of h aving a happy chat with a de ad person. Just for a moment, you may doubt in th e dream, saying to yourself, ‘Was he not d ead?’, but someh ow your mind reconciles itself to th e dream-vision, an d the person is as good as alive for the p urposes of th e dream. In other wor ds, the dream as a d ream do es not permit you to doubt its reality. It is the same in th e waking state, for you are unable to doubt the reality of the w orld whi ch you see while you are awake. Ho w can the mind whi ch has itself cr eated the world accept it as un real? That is the signific ance of t he comp arison made b etween the worl d of the w aking state a nd the dream world. Both ar e creations o f the mind an d, so lo ng as the mind is en grossed in eith er, it find s itself unable to deny their re ality. It cannot deny the reality of the d ream world w hile it is dreaming a nd it cannot deny the reality of the waking wo rld while it is awake. If, on the contrary, you withdraw your mind compl etely from the w orld an d turn it within a nd abide ther e, that is, if you keep awake always to the Self whi ch is the s ubstratum of all experiences, you will find the w orld of w hich you are n ow aware is just as unreal as t he worl d in whic h you lived in your dream. Q: We see, feel an d sense the w orld in so many ways. These sensatio ns are the reactions to th e objects seen and felt. They are not mental cr eations as in d reams, which differ n ot only from person to person but also with regard to t he same pe rson. Is that not e nough to pr ove the o bjective reality of the world? A: All this tal k about inconsiste ncies i n the dream-world a rises on ly now, wh en you are awake. While you are dreaming, th e dream was a perfectly integrated w hole. Th at is to s ay, if you felt thirsty in a d ream, the illusory drinking of illusory water quenched your illusory thirst. But all this was r eal an d not illusory to you so lo ng as you did not k now that th e dream itself was illus ory. Similarl y with the w aking wo rld. The sensations you now have get co-ordinated to giv e you the impre ssion that the world is real. If, on the contrary, the worl d is a self-exi stent re ality (that is wh at you evi dently mean by its objectivity), what prevents th e world fr om revealing itself to you in sle ep? You do not say you did not exist in your sleep. Q: Neither do I deny the worl d’s existence while I am asleep. It has been existing all th e while. If during my sleep I did not see it, oth ers wh o wer e not sleeping saw it. A: To say you exi sted w hile asle ep, wa s it necessary to call in th e evidence of others so as to prove it to you? Why do you seek their evi dence now? Those others ca n tell you of having seen the wo rld du ring your slee p only when you yourself are awake. With regard to your own existence it is different. On waking up you say you ha d a so und sleep, and so to that ext ent you are aware of yourself in th e deepest sleep, whereas you have not the slig htest no tion of the world’s exi stence then. Eve n now, while you are awake, is it the worl d that says ‘I am real’, or is it you? Q: Of co urse I say it, but I say it of the worl d. A: Well then, th at world, whi ch you say is real, is really mocking at you for seeking to prove its re ality while of your own reality you are ignorant. You want somehow or ot her to maintai n that the w orld is re al. What is the stan dard of re ality? Th at alone is real which exists by itself, which reveals itself by itself an d which is eternal and unchanging. 111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Does the w orld ex ist by itself ? Was it ever seen without the aid of the mind ? In sleep there is neither mind no r world. When aw ake there is the mind an d ther e is the wo rld. What do es this i nvariable c oncomitan ce mea n? You are familiar with th e principles o f inductive logic w hich are considered the very basis of scientific in vestig ation. Wh y do you not decide this qu estion of th e reality of the worl d in the lig ht of those accepted principles o f logic? Of yourself you can say ‘I exist’. That is, your exi stence is not mere e xistence, it is existence of whi ch you are conscious. Really, it is existence identical with consciousness. Q: The world may not be conscious of itself, yet it exists. A: Consciousness is alw ays Self-co nsciousness. If you are c onscious of a nything you are essentially conscious of yourself. Unself-c onscious ex istence is a c ontradiction in terms. It is no existence at all. It is merely attrib uted existence, wh ereas true e xistence, the sat, is not an attribut e, it is the substance itself. It is the vastu [reality ]. Reality is therefore known as sat-c hit, being- co nsciousness, an d never merely the one to the exclusion o f the other. The w orld neither ex ists by itself, nor is it conscious of its existence. How can you say that su ch a w orld is real ? And what is the nature of the wo rld? It is perpetual ch ange, a co ntinuous, intermina ble flu x. A dependent, unself-co nscious, ever- changing worl d cannot be real. Q: Are the name s and forms of the w orld re al? A: You won’t find them se parate from the substratum [adhisht ana]. When you try to get at n ame an d form, you will find reality only. Therefore attain th e knowledge of th at which is real for all time. Q: Why does the waking state loo k so re al? A: We se e so much o n the cinema screen, but it is not real. Nothing is real there ex cept the s creen. In the s ame way in the waking stat e, there is no thing but a dhishtana. Kn owledge of th e world is kn owledge of th e knower of the w orld [jagrat-prama is the prama of j agrat-pramata]. Both go away in sleep. Q: Why do we see such permane ncy and constancy in the world? A: It is se en on account of wrong ideas. When some one says that he took a bath in the s ame river twice h e is wro ng, because when he bathed for the second time the riv er is not the s ame as it was wh en he bathed for the first time. On looking twice at th e brig htness of a flame a man s ays that he sees th e same flame, but this flame is changing every moment. The waking state is like this. The st ationary appearance is an error of pe rception. Q: Where is the e rror? A: Pramata [the kn ower]. Q: How did th e knower come? A: On account of the err or of pe rception. In fact th e knower and his misperc eptions appear simultan eously, and when the knowledge of the Self is obtained, they disappear simultan eously. Q: From where did the knower and his misperc eptions com e? A: Who is as king the q uestion? Q: l am. A: Find out t hat ‘I’ and all your do ubts will be solved. Ju st as in a dr eam a false kn owledge, kn ower and known rise up, in the wa king state the same process operates. In both states o n knowing this ‘I’ you know everything and nothing remains to b e known. In de ep sleep, knower, kn owledge and known ar e absent. In the same way, at the time of experiencing the real ‘I’ th ey will not exist. Whatev er you se e happening in th e waking state ha ppens only to the knower, and since the knower is un real, nothing in fact ever happens.

A: On realizatio n of th e Self you will find t hat the refl ection and the s urface on which it takes place do not actually exist, but that bo th of t hem are one and the same chit. Ther e is the worl d, which requires lo cation for its existence and light to mak e it perceptibl e. Both rise simultan eously.

As a co ncession to t hose who were unable to a ssimilate the implication s of this truth, Sri Rama na wo uld sometimes admit that rein carnation existed. In re plying to such people he would say that if one imagin ed that the individual self was real, then that imagin ary self wo uld persist aft er death and that eventually it would identify with a ne w body and a new life. The whole pr ocess, he said, is sustained by the tendency of the mind to i dentify itself with a body. Once the limiting illusio n of mind is tran scended, identificati on with th e body ceases, an d all the ories a bout death an d reincarnation are f ound to b e inapplicable. Q: Is rei ncarnation tru e? A: Reincarnation exists o nly so long as th ere is ign orance. There is re ally no reincarnation at all, either now or be fore. Nor will ther e be any hereafter. This is the trut h. Q: Can a yogi know his past lives? A: Do you know the p resent life that you wish to know th e past? Find the p resent, the n the re st will follow. Ev en with our present limited knowledge, you suffer so much. Wh y should you bu rden yourself with more kn owledge? Is it to suffer more? When s een through the sig ht of the s upreme space of Self, the illusi on of ta king birth in this mirage-li ke false world is fo und to be nothing b ut the egotistical ign orance of identifying a bo dy as ‘I’.

Q: How lon g does it take a man to be r eborn aft er death? Is it immediately after de ath or some time after? A: You do not know what you were be fore birth, yet you want to k now what you will be after de ath. Do you kn ow what you are n ow? Birth an d rebirth pe rtain to th e body. You are identifying the Self with the b ody. It is a wr ong identificatio n. You believe that the b ody has been born and will die, and confound the phenomena relating t o the body with the Self. Know your real being and these questions will no t arise. Birth an d rebirth are menti oned only to mak e you inv estigate the q uestion a nd find ou t that th ere ar e neither births n or rebirths.

Q: Is the Buddhist vi ew, that ther e is no continuous entity answering to th e ideas of th e individual soul, co rrect or not? Is this co nsistent with the Hi ndu notion of a reincarnating e go? Is the s oul a c ontinuous entity which rei ncarnates again and again, according to the Hin du doctrine, or is it a mere mass of ment al tendencies – samskar as? A: The real Self is co ntinuous and unaffected. The rei ncarnating ego belongs to t he low er plane, namely, thought. It is transcended by Self-re alizatio n. Reincarnations are due to a sp urious offs hoot. Therefore th ey are denied by the Bu ddhists.

Ther e is only the present. Yesterday was the present to you when you experienced it, and tomorr ow will be also the present when you experience it. Therefore, ex perience ta kes place only in the present, and beyond ex perience nothing exists. Q: Are then past an d future mere imagin ation?

A: There is no relation be tween the standard of meas urements o f one state of c onsciousness a nd another. All su ch measurements ar e hypothetic al.

Q: How does the jiva tran sfer from one body to another? A: When one begins to die, hard breathing s ets in; that mean s that on e has become un conscious of th e dying b ody. The mind at o nce takes hold of a nother body, and it swings to and fro between the tw o, until attachment is fully transferre d to th e new body.

One remains only as wh at one really is. This is the only truth. Q: I find this very confusing. Ar e both births an d rebirths ultimately unreal?

For the same re ason and in th e same mann er you must have succeeding births. But if you as k who has the birth and whether birth an d death are for you or for s omebo dy distinct from you, then you re alize th e truth an d the truth burns up all ka rmas and frees you from all birt hs. The books graphically describe h ow all sa nchita ka rma [karma accumul ated fr om previous birth s], which would take countless lives to e xhaust, is burnt up by one little sp ark of jnana, just as a mountain of gu npowder will be blown up by a single s park of fire.

Sometimes he would say that Go d is just an idea in t he mind, while at ot her times he would say that God is th e only existi ng reality. These contradictory stateme nts are largely a reflection of t he differi ng levels of u nderstanding h e encountered in his questioners. Those w ho worshipped personal G ods w ould often be given anthropomor phic e xplanations. They would be told th at God created the world, th at he sustains it by his divi ne power, th at he looks after the n eeds of all its inhabitants an d that nothing h appens that is contrary to his will. On the other hand, those wh o wer e not attr acted to such a theory would be told th at all such ideas about G od and his power wer e mental cre ations which only obscured the real ex perience of G od whi ch is in herent in ev eryone. At the highest level of his teachings th e terms ‘God’ an d ‘Self ar e synonyms for the immanent re ality which is discovered by Self-r ealization. Th us realiz ation of the Self is realization o f God; it is not an experience of Go d, rath er it is an understanding that on e is Go d. Speaking from this ultimate le vel, Sri Ramana’s statements o n God can be summarised in t he follo wing w ay: 1 He is immanent a nd formless; he is pu re being and pure consciousness. 2 Manifestatio n appears in him and through his po wer, bu t he is no t its creator. God never acts, he j ust is. He h as neither will no r desire. 3 Individuality is the illusio n that we ar e not id entical with God; when the illusi on is dis pelled, what remains is Go d. On a lower le vel he spoke about Iswar a, the Hin du name for th e supreme personal God. He said th at Iswara exists a s a real entity only so long as one imagin es that on e is an individual per son. When in dividuality persists th ere is a God who supervises th e activities o f the universe; in th e absence of individuality Iswara is non-existent. Besides Isw ara, Hin duism has many deitie s which resembl e the gods and demons of Nor se and Greek my thology. Such deities a re a ce ntral feature of popular Hin duism and their re ality is still widely accepted. Sri Rama na sur prised many people by saying that su ch beings wer e as re al as the p eople who believed in them. He admitted that aft er realizatio n they shared the same fate a s Iswar a, but prior to that, he s eemed t o regard th em as senior o fficials in a cosmologi cal hier archy which l ooked after the a ffairs of th e world. Q: God is de scribed as manifest an d unm anifest. As th e former he is sai d to incl ude the wo rld as a p art of his b eing. If that is so, we as part of that worl d should have easily known him in the manifest ed form. A: Know yourself before you seek to decide about the n ature of Go d and the world. Q: Does knowing myself imply knowing God? A: Yes, Go d is within you. Q: Then, wh at stands in th e way of my knowing myself or God? A: Your wandering mind an d perverted ways. Q: Is Go d personal? A: Yes, he is always the first person, the I, ever standing b efore you. Because you give precedence to wo rldly things, God appears to ha ve receded to th e background. If you give up all els e and seek him alone, he alone will remain a s the ‘I’, the Self. Q: Is Go d apart from the Self? A: The Self is God. ‘I am’ is Go d. This qu estion arises because you are holding on to the e go self. It will not aris e if 118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman you hold onto th e true Self. For the real Self will not and cannot ask anything. If Go d be apart fr om the Self he must be a Self-less Go d, which is absurd. Go d, who seems to be non-existent, alone truly exists, whereas th e indi vidual, who seems to be existing, is ever non-existent. Sages say that th e state in w hich o ne thus knows on e’s own no n- existence [sunya] alone is th e glorious supreme knowledge. You now thin k that you are an individual, that there is the universe and that God is beyon d the cosmos. So there is the idea of se parateness. This id ea must go. For Go d is not separate from you or th e cosmos. The Gita also s ays: The Self am I, O Lor d of Sleep, In every creature’s heart enshrined. The ris e and noon of every form, I am its final do om as well (Bh agavad Gita, X.20). Thus God is not only in the heart of all, he is the p rop of all, he is the s ource of all, their ab iding place and their en d. All proceed from him, have their stay in him, and finally resolve into h im. Therefore he is no t separate. Q: How are w e to understand this pa ssage in th e Gita ‘This wh ole co smos forms a particle of me’? A: It does not mea n that a small particle o f God separates from him and forms the universe. His sa kti [pow er] is acting. As a re sult of one phase of su ch activity the cosmos has become manifest. Similarl y, the stat ement in Purusha Sukt a, ‘All th e beings form his on e foot’, does not mea n that Bra hman is in se veral parts. Q: I understand that. Brahman is cert ainly not divisi ble. A: So the fact is that Brahman is all an d remain s indivisible. It is ever realized but man is no t aware of this. He must come to k now this. Knowledge mea ns the overcoming of ob stacles whi ch obstruct the revelation of t he eter nal trut h that th e Self is the same as Brahman. The obstacles ta ken together f orm your idea of s eparateness as an individual. Q: Is Go d the same as Self? A: The Self is known to everyone, but not cl early. You alw ays exist. The b e-ing is the Self. ‘I am’ is the name o f God. Of all the definitio ns of Go d, none is in deed so well put as t he Biblic al statement ‘I am th at I am’ in Exo dus 3. There are other statements, su ch as Brahmaiv aham [Brahman am I], aham Brahmasmi [I am Brahman] and soham [I am he]. But no ne is so dire ct as the n ame Je hovah which means ‘I am’. The absolute bei ng is wh at is. It is the Self. It is God. Knowing the Self, God is known. In fa ct God is none other th an the Self. Q: God seems to be known by many different names. Are any of them justified? A: Among the many thousands of names of G od, no name suits G od, wh o abides in the He art, devoid of thought, so truly, aptly, and beautifully as the name ‘I’ or ‘I am’. Of all the k nown nam es of Go d, the nam e of God ‘I’ - ‘I’ al one will resound triumpha ntly when the ego is de stroyed, rising as the silent su preme wor d [moun a-para-vak] in the He art- space of those wh ose attentio n is Selfw ard-facing. Eve n if one unceasingly meditates u pon that name ‘I-’I’ with one’s attention o n the feeling ‘I’, it will take one and plunge one into th e source from which thought rises, de stroying the ego, the embryo, which is jo ined to t he body. Q: What is the relatio nship bet ween God and the world? Is he the creator or s ustainer of it? A: Sentient and insentient be ings of all kin ds are performing acti ons only by the mere presence of the sun, which rises in the sky without any volition. Similarly all ac tions are done by the Lor d without any volition or de sire on his pa rt. In the mere p resence of th e sun, th e magnifying lens emits fire, the lotus-b ud blossoms, the wat er-lily closes and all the countless cr eatures perform actions and rest.

The a ctions of livin g beings certainly do not g o and affect Go d, who transcends th e mind, in the same man ner as t he activities of th e world d o not affect that su n and as the qualities of th e conspicuous four eleme nts [earth, water, fire and air] do not affect th e limitless space. Q: Why is samsara — cr eation and manifest ation as finitised — so f ull of sorrow and evil? A: God’s will! Q: Why does Go d will it so? A: It is ins crutable. No motiv e can be attrib uted to that po wer – no desire, no end to achieve can be asserte d of th at one infinite, all-wis e and all-po werful being. Go d is untouched by activities, which take place in his pr esence. Compar e the s un and the worl d activitie s. There is no meaning in attrib uting r esponsibility and motiv e to the o ne before it becomes many. Q: Does everything ha ppen by the will of God? A: It is no t possible f or anyone to do anything o pposed to th e ordinance of God, who has the ability to do everything. Therefore to remain sile nt at the feet of God, having given up all the anxieties of the wic ked, defective and delusive mind, is best. Q: Is there a se parate be ing Iswara [personal God] who is th e rewarder of virtue a nd punisher of sins ? Is ther e a God? A: Yes. Q: What is he like? A: Iswara has individuality in mind and body, which a re perishable, bu t at the same time he has also the transcendental consciousness a nd liberati on inw ardly. Iswara, the personal Go d, the s upreme creator of th e universe really does exist. But this is true o nly from the relative standpoint o f those who have not realiz ed the truth, th ose pe ople who believe in the re ality of individual so uls. From the absolute st andpoint the sage cannot accept any other existence than the impers onal Self, one and formless. Iswara has a physical bo dy, a form and a name, but it is not so g ross a s this material body. It can be seen in visio ns in the form created by the devotee. Th e forms and names of G od are many and various an d differ with ea ch religio n. His essence is the s ame as ours, the real Self be ing only one and with out form. Hence forms he assumes ar e only creations or appearances. Iswara is immane nt in every person and every object throughout the u niverse. The totality of all thi ngs and beings constitut es God. Th ere is a po wer out of w hich a small fra ction h as become all this u niverse, an d the remain der is in reserve. Both this res erve power plus the manif ested p ower as material worl d together c onstitute Isw ara. Q: So ultimately Iswara is not r eal? A: Existence of Iswara follows fr om our conception of Isw ara. Let us first know whose concept he is. The c oncept will be only according to th e one who conceives. Find o ut wh o you are and the o ther p roblems will sol ve themselves. Iswara, God, th e creator, the p ersonal God, is the la st of the unreal forms to go. Only the absolute be ing is real. Hence, not only the wo rld, not only the ego, but also the p ersonal God are of u nreality. We must fin d the a bsolute – nothing less. Q: You say that e ven the hi ghest Go d is still only an idea. Do es that mean that th ere is no God? 120"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman A: No, ther e is an Iswara. Q: Does he exist in any particular pl ace or form? A: If the individual is a form, even Self, the source, wh o is the Lor d, will als o appear to be a form. If one is not a form, since th ere th en cannot be knowledge of ot her thi ngs, will that statement th at God has a form be correct? God assumes any form imagi ned by the devotee thr ough repeated thinking in p rolonged medit ation. Th ough he thus assumes en dless names, the r eal formless co nsciousness alone is Go d. With regard to h is location, Go d does not resi de in any place other than the He art. It is due to illusio n, caused by the ego, the I am the body’ idea, that the ki ngdom of Go d is conceived to be elsewhere. Be sure that the H eart is the kingdom of God. Know th at you are the perfect, shi ning lig ht which not o nly makes the existence of Go d’s ki ngdom possible, bu t also allows it to be seen as s ome wonderful heaven. To kn ow this is alone jnana. Ther efore, the kingdom of God is withi n you.

Q: They say that the jiva [individ ual] is subject to t he evil eff ects o f illusion such as limited vision a nd knowledge, whereas Iswar a has all-pervading vision and knowledge. It is als o said th at jiva and Iswara be come id entical if the individual dis cards his limited vision a nd knowledge. Should not Isw ara als o discard hi s particular ch aracteristics s uch as all-p ervading vision a nd knowledge? They too are illusio ns, are n’t they? A: Is that your doubt? First discard your own limited vision and then there will be time en ough to think of Iswar a’s all-pe rvading vision and knowledge. First get rid of your own limited knowledge. Why do you worry about Is wara? He will look after himself. Has h e not got as muc h capacity as we have? Why should we w orry about wh ether h e possesses all-p ervading vi sion a nd knowledge or not? It is indeed a g reat thi ng if we ca n take care of o urselves. Q: But d oes God know everything? A: The Ve das declare G od to b e omnis cient on ly to those w ho ignorantly think t hemselv es to be people of little knowledge. But if one attains a nd knows him as he really is, it will be found that God does not know anything, because his nature is the e ver-real wh ole, ot her th an whi ch nothing exists to be known. Q: Why do religio ns speak of Gods, he aven, he ll, etc.? A: Only to make the p eople realize t hat they are on a par with this wo rld an d that the Self alone is real. The reli gions are according to t he vie w-poi nt of th e seeker. Q: Do Vishnu, Siva, etc., exist? A: Individual huma n souls are n ot the o nly beings kn own. Q: And their sacred regions Kailas a or Vai kuntha, ar e they real? A: As real as you are in t his body. Q: Do they possess a phenomenal e xistence, like my body?

Do the Go ds Isw ara or Vis hnu exist lik e that? A: Yes. Q: Is Go d subject to pralaya [cosmic diss olutio n]? A: Why? Man be comin g aware of th e Self transcends cosmic dissolution a nd becomes liber ated. Why not Iswara w ho is infinitely wiser and abler? Q: Do devas [an gels] and pisachas [devils] exist similarl y? A: Yes. Q: These deities, wh at is their status rel ative to th e Self? A: Siva, Ganapati and other deities lik e Brahma, exist fr om a hum an sta ndpoint; that is to s ay, if you co nsider your personal self as real, then they also exist. Just as a government ha s its high executive offic ers to ca rry on the government, so h as the creator. But from the sta ndpoint o f the Self all these gods are illusory and must th emselve s merge int o the o ne reality. Q: When ever I worship God with name an d form, I feel tempted t o think w hether I am not wro ng in d oing so, as t hat would be limiting the limitless, giving form to the formless. At the same time I feel I am not c onstant in my adherence to wor ship G od with out form. A: As long as you respond to a name, wh at objection could there b e to your worshipping a G od with n ame or form ? Worship Go d with or with out form till you know who you are. Q: I find it diffic ult to believe in a p ersonal God. In f act I find it impossible. But I ca n believe in an imper sonal Go d, a divine f orce w hich rules an d guides the world, an d it would be a great help to me, ev en in my work of h ealing, if this faith w ere in creased. May I know how to increase this faith? A: Faith is in things unknown, bu t the Self is self-ev ident. Even the greatest egotist ca nnot deny his ow n existence, that is to say, cannot deny the Self. You can call the ultimate reality by whatever name you like and say that you have faith in it or lo ve for it, but wh o is there who will no t have faith i n his own existence or lo ve for h imself? That is because faith an d love are our real nat ure. Q: Should I no t have any idea about Go d? A: Only so long as th ere ar e other tho ughts in the H eart ca n there be a thought of Go d conceived by one’s mind. The destruction of e ven that thought of God due to the destruction o f all other thoughts alone is the u nthought th ought, which is the tru e thought of Go d. 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Chapter 20 - Suffering and morality The p aradoxes inherent in theistic th eories h ave engaged the minds of west ern th eologians and philosophers for centuries. For exampl e, if Go d is perfect, why is there ev il in the wo rld? Why does an omnip otent God all ow suff ering when he has the p ower to abolish it at a stroke? Sri Ramana si de-ste ps such conundrums by statin g that th e world, God and the individual who suffers a re all inv entions of t he mind. All religio ns first postulate thr ee pri nciples, the wo rld, the soul and God. To say that on e principle alone appears as the three p rinciples or th at the thr ee pri nciples are al ways three principles is po ssible only as long as the ego exists. Instead of attributi ng suffering to the c onsequence of wr ong actions or to th e will of God, Sri Rama na taught that it only arises because w e imagine th at we are separate i ndividuals interacting wit h each other an d with th e worl d. He said that wro ng actions comp ound the suff ering, an d are ther efore to be avoided, but they are not its ori ginal ca use. It is the mind th at creates the illusi on of s eparateness and it is the mind th at suffers the consequences of its illusory inventions. Sufferi ng is thu s a product an d consequence of the dis criminative mind; wh en the mind is eliminated, suffering is found to be non-existent. Many questioners c ould relat e to this idea on an individual level but th ey found it hard to accept that all the suffering in the world e xisted only in the mind o f the person who perceived it. Sri Raman a was quite adamant ab out this an d he repeatedly said th at if one realises th e Self one will kn ow th at all suffering, no t just one’s own, is non-existent. Taki ng this id ea to its logical conclusion, Sri Ramana o ften said th e most eff ective way of eliminating ot her people’s suffering was to re alize th e Self. This sta ndpoint should no t be interpreted to mea n that Sri Ramana en couraged his f ollower s to ignore th e suffering of other pe ople. On a more pr agmatic le vel he said th at prior to Self-re alizatio n one should accept the reality of other people’s suff ering and take step s to relieve it whenever on e com es across it. However, he also pointed out that su ch remedi al actions wo uld on ly be spiritu ally beneficial if they were do ne witho ut the feeling t hat ‘oth er people less fortunate than me ar e being helped’ an d with out th e feeli ng that ‘I am performing the se acti ons’. On th e whole, the q uestion o f what on e should or s hould no t do in the worl d was o f little inter est to Sri Raman a. He maintain ed the view t hat all conventional id eas ab out right an d wrong were value-judgments mad e by the mind, an d that w hen the mind ce ases to exi st, ideas ab out right an d wrong also cease. Because of this he rarely spoke about the conventional canons of moralit y, and whenever he was pressed to offer an opinion on them, he would us ually side- step the iss ue by saying that the only ‘right action’ was d iscovering th e Self. Q: What do you consider to be the cause of worl d suffering? And how can we help to ch ange it, (a) as in dividuals, or (b) co llectively? A: Realize the re al Self. It is all th at is necessary. Q: In this life beset with limitations ca n I ev er realize th e bliss of th e Self? A: That bliss o f the Self is always with you, and you will find it for yourself, if you would seek it earnestly. The cause of your misery is not in the life ou tside you, it is in you as the ego. You impose limitations on yourself and then make a vain stru ggle to transcend them. All unhappiness is du e to th e ego; with it com es all your trou ble. What does it avail you to attrib ute to th e happenings in life th e cause of misery which is really withi n you? What ha ppiness can you get from things extraneous to yourself? When you get it, how long will it last? If you would deny the ego and scorch it by ignoring it, you would be free. If you accept it, it will impos e limitations on you and throw you into a va in stru ggle to transcend them. To be the Self that you really are is the only means to realiz e the blis s that is ever yours. Q: If truly there is ne ither b ondage nor liber ation, what is the reason for th e actual ex perience of j oys and sorrows ? A: They appear to be r eal only when one turns asi de from one’s real nature. They do not really exist. Q: Is the world c reated for h appiness or misery? 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman A: Creation is neither go od nor bad; it is as it is. It is the human mind which puts all sorts of co nstructions on it, seeing things from its ow n angle and interpreting th em to suit its ow n interests. A woma n is just a woman, bu t one mind calls he r ‘mother’, an other ‘sister’, and still another ‘a unt’ an d so on. Men love wome n, hate snakes, an d are indifferent to th e grass an d stones by the roadside. These value-judgments ar e the cause of all the misery in the worl d. Creation is like a pe epul tree: bir ds come to e at its fruit, or take shelter under its br anches, men c ool th emselv es in its shade, but s ome may hang themselve s on it.

Instead, he goes on whi ning, like the hungry man w ho sits be side the tasty dish and who, in stead of stretc hing out his hand to satisfy his hunger, goes on lamentin g, ‘Whos e fault is it, Go d’s or man’s ?’ Q: If Go d is all why does the individual su ffer for hi s actions? Are not the actions for w hich the individual is made to suffer prompted by him? A: He who thin ks he is the doer is als o the suff erer. Q: But th e actions ar e prompted by God and the i ndividual is only his tool. A: This logi c is applied only when one suffers, but not when one rejoices. If the c onviction prevails always, there will be no suffering eith er. Q: When will the suffering cease? A: Not until individuality is lost. If both the g ood and bad actions are hi s, why should you think that the enjoyment and suffering are yours alo ne? He who does good or ba d, also enjoys pleasure o r suffers pain. Leave it there an d do not superimpos e suffering on yourself. Q: How can you say that s ufferin g is non-existent? I see it ev erywhere. A: One’s own reality, which shi nes wit hin ev eryone as th e Heart, is itself the ocean of u nalloyed bliss. Th erefore like the unreal blu eness of th e sky, misery does not e xist in re ality but only in mere imagin ation. Since one’s ow n reality, which is the s un of jnana that c annot be approached by the dark delusion of i gnorance, itself shi nes as happiness, miser y is nothing but an illusio n caused by the unreal sense of in dividuality. In trut h no one has ever experienced any such thi ng other th an that unreal illusio n. If one scrutinis es one’s own Self, which is bliss, there will be n o misery at all in on e’s life. On e suffers because of t he ide a that th e body, which is ne ver oneself, is ‘I’; suffering is all due to this delusion. Q: I suff er in bot h mind an d body. From the day of my birth I have never had happiness. My mother t oo suff ered from the time she conceived me, I hear. Why do I suffer thus? I have not sinned in this life. Is all this du e to th e sins of p ast lives? A: You say the mind an d body suffer. But do they ask the questions? Who is the questioner? Is it not the o ne that is beyon d both mind and body? Yo u say the body suffers in this life an d ask if the cause of this is the p revious life. If that is so t hen the cause of that life is the o ne before it, and so on.

That same ignorance is present even now, framing this qu estion. That ig norance must be remove d by jnana. ‘Why and to wh om did this suff ering c ome?’ If you question th us you will find that the ‘I’ is separate from the mind and body, that the Self is the o nly eternal being, an d that it is eternal bliss. That is jn ana. Q: I suff er from worries with out en d; there is no peace for me, th ough there is nothing wanting for me to be happy. A: Do these wo rries aff ect you in sle ep?

Are w e to call it a dream and remain u nmov ed by his pain? A: From the point o f view of j nana or the reality, the pain you speak of is certainly a dream, as is the worl d of which the pain is an infinite simal part. In the dream also you yourself fe el hunger. You see others suff ering h unger. You feed yourself an d, move d by pity, feed the o thers that you find suff ering fr om hunger. So long as th e dream lasts, all tho se hunger pains are quit e as real as you now thin k the p ain you see in t he world to be.

But all this is not t o say that while you are in th e dream you can act as if the p ain you feel there is not r eal. The hunger in th e dream has to be assuaged by the food in th e dream. The fellow be ings you fo und so hungry in the dream had to be provided with fo od in that dream. You can never mix up the two state s, the dream and the wa king state. Till you reach the stat e of jnana and thus wa ke out of this maya, you must do social service by relieving suffering wh enever you see it. But ev en then you must do it, as we a re told, with out ah amkar a, that is without the sense ‘I am the doer’, bu t feeling, ‘I am the Lord’s tool.’ Similarl y one must not be conceited a nd think, ‘I am helping a man b elow me. He ne eds help. I am in a position to h elp. I am superior an d he inferi or.’ You must he lp the man as a mean s of wors hipping God in that man. All such service to o is for you the Self, no t for anybo dy else. You are not h elping anybody else, but o nly yourself. Q: In the case of p ersons w ho are not c apable of long meditatio n, will it not be enough if they engage themselv es in doing good to ot hers? A: Yes, it will do. Th e idea of good will be in their he art. That is en ough. Good, God, lo ve, are all the same thin g. If the person keeps continuously thinking of a ny one of these, it will be enough. All meditation is for th e purpose of k eeping out all ot her th oughts. Q: So on e should try to amelior ate suff ering, even if one knows that ultimatel y it is no n- existent? A: There never was and never will be a time wh en all ar e equally happy or rich o r wise or he althy. In fact n one of these terms has any meaning except in so far a s the opposite to it exists. But th at does not mea n that wh en you come across a nyone wh o is less ha ppy or more misera ble th an yourself, you are not to be moved to compassion or to se ek to relieve him as best you ca n. On the contrary, you must lo ve all an d help all, since only in that way can you help yourself. When you seek to re duce the suffering of a ny fellow man or f ellow cre ature, whether your efforts su cceed or not, you are yourself ev olving spirit ually especially if such ser vice is rendered disint erestedly, not with the e gotistic feeling ‘I am doing this’, but i n the spirit ‘Go d is making me the c hannel of this ser vice; he is the d oer and I am the instrument.’ If one knows the truth th at all that on e gives to ot hers is gi ving only to oneself, who indeed will not be a virtuous person and perform the kind act o f giving to ot hers? Since e veryone is on e’s own Self, whoever does wh atever to whomever is doing it only to himself. Q: There ar e widespread disaster s spreading havoc in th e worl d, for example famine an d pestilence. What is the cause of this stat e of affairs? A: To whom does all this a ppear? 125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman Q: That won’t d o. I see misery everywhere. A: You were not aware of th e worl d and its sufferings in your sleep but you are conscious of th em now in your waking state. Co ntinue in that state i n which you wer e not affli cted by them. That is to say, when you ar e not aware of the world, its sufferings do not affect you. When you remain as t he Self, as in sleep, the worl d and its sufferings will not affect you. Therefore lo ok withi n. See the Self! Then there will be an end of the w orld an d its miseries. Q: But th at is selfishness. A: The wo rld is not external. Because you identify yourself wro ngly with the body you see the w orld ou tside, and its pain becomes a pparent to you. But they are not real. Seek the r eality and get rid of this un real feeling. Q: There ar e great men, public workers, wh o cannot solve the p roblem of the misery of the worl d. A: They are ego-centred and that ac counts for their in ability . If they remaine d in the Self they would be different. Q: Why do not mah atmas help? A: How do you know that th ey do not h elp? Public sp eeches, physical activity and materi al help are all ou tweighed by the sile nce of mahatmas. They accomplis h more than others. Q: What is to b e done by us for amelior ating th e condition of th e worl d? A: If you remain fre e from pain, ther e will be no pain anywhere. Th e trouble no w is due to your seeing the wo rld externally and also thin king that ther e is pain there. But b oth th e worl d and the pain ar e within you. If you look withi n there will be no pain. Q: God is pe rfect. Wh y did he create the world imperf ect? The wor k shares the nature of th e author. But he re it is not so. A: Who is it that raise s the question? Q: I — the individual. A: Are you apart from Go d that you ask this qu estion? So long as you consider yourself to be the body, you se e the world as external and the imperf ections appear to you. God is perfection. His w ork al so is perf ection. But you see it as imperfe ction b ecause of your wrong identificatio n. Q: Why did the Self manifest as this misera ble worl d? A: In order th at you might seek it. Yo ur eyes cannot see themselv es. Place a mirror bef ore th em and they see themsel ves. Similarl y with cr eation. ‘See yourself first and then see the whole worl d as the Self.’ Q: So it amounts to this – that I sh ould always look within. A: Yes. Q: Should I no t see the worl d at all? A: You are not instru cted to shut your eyes to the w orld. Yo u are o nly to ‘see yourself first and then see the wh ole world as the Self.

What is peace, and who is th e worker? The worl d is not in your sleep and forms a projection of your mind in your jagrat [wakin g state]. It is therefore an idea and nothing else.

Q: If it is a q uestion o f doing somet hing o ne considers wro ng, an d thereby saving someo ne else from a great wrong, should one do it or refr ain? A: What is right a nd wr ong? There is no standard by which to judge somethin g to be right and another to be wrong. Opinions differ ac cording to th e nature of th e indi vidual an d according to the s urroundings. They are again ideas and nothing more. Do not worry about them but g et rid of th oughts in stead. If you always remain in th e right, the n right will prevail in the wo rld. Q: Will not right conduct be e nough to se cure salvation? A: Salvation for wh om? Who wants s alvation? And what is right co nduct? What is conduct? And what is right? Who is to judge what is right an d what is wrong? According to pr evious samskar as, each one regards somethi ng or o ther a s right. Only when the reality is known can the truth ab out right an d wro ng be known. The b est co urse is to find ou t who wants this salv ation. Tracing this ‘w ho’ or e go to its original source is the ri ght co nduct for everyone. Q: Will not the p ractice of g ood conduct [nitya karmas] lead to sal vation? Several bo oks state th at it will. A: It is sai d so in bo oks. Who denies that good conduct is good or th at it will eventually lead you to the goal? Good conduct or sat karma pu rifies th e chitta o r mind a nd gives you chitta suddhi [pur e mind]. The pure mind attain s jnana, which is wh at is mea nt by salvation. So, eventually, jnana must be reached, that is, the ego must be traced to its source. But to those to wh om this do es not appeal, we have to say that sat ka rmas lead to chitta su ddhi, and chitta suddhi will le ad to rig ht knowledge or jnana, and that in its tur n gives salvation. Q: What about motives ? Are th e motiv es for p erformin g actions not important ? A: Whatever is do ne lovingly, with ri ghteous purity and with peace of mind, is a g ood action. Everything whi ch is do ne with the stai n of de sire an d with a gitatio n filling the mind is cla ssified a s a bad action. Do not perform any good action [karma] through a bad mean s, thinking ‘It is sufficie nt if it bears good fruit.’ Because, if the mea ns is ba d, even a good action will turn o ut to be a bad one. Therefor e, even the means of doing actions should be pure. Q: Sankara says we ar e all free, not b ound, and that we s hall all go back to Go d from whom we ha ve come as s parks from a fire. Then w hy should we n ot commit all sorts o f sins? A: It is tru e we are n ot bound and that the re al Self h as no bondage. It is tru e that you will eventually go back to your source. But meanwhile, if you commit sins, as you call th em, you will have to fa ce the consequences of such sins. Yo u cannot escape them. If a man b eats you, then, can you say, ‘I am free, I am no t bound by these beatings and I don’t feel any pain. Let him beat on’? If you can feel like t hat, you ca n go on doing what you like. What is the use of merely saying with your lips ‘I am free’? Q: It is said th at the wh ole un iverse is Go d’s pl ay of consciousness a nd that ev erything is full of Brahman. Th en why should we say that ba d habits a nd bad practices s hould be discarded? A: Suppose there is some wound inside th e huma n body. If you neglect it, on the assumptio n that it is only a small part of the body, it causes pai n to th e whole body. If it is not cured by ordinary treatme nt, the doctor must come, cut off the affected p ortion with a kn ife an d remo ve the impurities. If the dis eased part is not cut off it will fester. If you do not b andage it after o perating, pus will form. It is the same thing with re gard to conduct. Bad h abits a nd bad conduct ar e like a w ound in th e body. Every disease must be given appropriat e treatment. Q: So on e should adhere to th e conventional co des of be haviour? A: Since the prescribed observances for self-d iscipline [ni yamas] help one to a considerable ext ent, they are w orthy to be accepted and followe d.

In its most po pular form it states t hat ther e is a universal accounting system in which each individual must experience the c onsequences of all his a ctions [karmas]; good actions bring g ood results an d bad actions inevitably result in su ffering to the o ne who does them. The theory also states that the c onsequences of a ctions [also k nown as karmas] need not n ecessarily be experienced in th e present life, they can be carried over into future lives. Bec ause of this, se veral sub-divisions of karma ha ve been postulated. Th e following cl assific ation w hich w as used by Sri Rama na is common to many Hindu schools of th ought: 1 San chita k arma The st ore of k armic debts accumulat ed from previous births. 2 Prara bdha karma That pa rt of one’s sa nchita ka rma which must be worked out in th e present life. Be cause the law of karma implies de terminism in hum an acti vities, prarabdha is often tra nslated as d estiny. 3 Agami karma New ka rma accumulate d in the p resent lifetime which is ca rried forwar d into f uture liv es. Sri Rama na accepted the validity of the laws of k arma but s aid th at they were on ly applicable as long as a person imagin ed that he was separate fr om the Self. At this level (the lev el of the a jnani), he said that in dividuals will pass through a se ries of pr e-ordained activities a nd experiences, all of which are t he consequences of previous act s and thoughts. He oc casionally even said t hat ev ery act and experience in a p erson’s life is det ermined at b irth an d that the only freedom one has is to realiz e that th ere is no one acting and no one experiencing. However, on ce one realis es the Self there is no one left to ex perience the consequences of actions and so the wh ole str ucture of karmic laws then becomes r edundant. Sri Rama na regarded the law of k arma as a manif estatio n of God’s will. He said th at prior to Self-re alizatio n there is a personal Go d, Iswara, who controls ea ch person’s d estiny. It is Iswar a who has ordained that e veryone must suff er the consequences of his ac tions and it is Iswar a who selects the sequence of activities th at each person must undergo in each lifetime. One cannot es cape from Iswar a’s jurisdiction w hile on e still identifies wit h the acti vities of th e body. The o nly way to become free o f his authority is to tra nscend karma completely by realisin g the Self. Q: Is it possible to o vercome, ev en while the b ody exists, the prarabdha karma which is said to last till the end of th e body? A: Yes. If the agent upon whom the karma depends, namely the ego, whi ch has com e into ex istence between the body and the Self, merge s in its source and loses its form, how can the k arma whic h depends upon it sur vive? When th ere is no ‘I’ there is no karma. Q: It is said th at prarabdha karma is only a small fraction of the k arma accumulat ed from previous lives. Is this tru e? A: A man might have performed many karmas in his previous birth s. A few of these alone will be chosen for this birth and he will have to enjoy their fruits in this birth. It is somethin g like a slid e show wh ere th e projectionist picks a few slides to be exhibited at a performanc e, the remaini ng slid es bei ng reserved for another performan ce. All this k arma can be destroyed by acquiring knowledge of the Self. The differ ent ka rmas are th e slide s, karmas bei ng the result of past experiences, and the mind is th e projector. Th e projector must be destroyed so that ther e will be no further reflection a nd no further birt hs and no deaths. Q: Who is the projectionist? What is the mec hanism whic h selects a small portion of th e sanchita k arma an d then decides that it shall be experienced as prarabdha karma? A: Individuals ha ve to suffer their ka rmas but Isw ara mana ges to make the b est of th eir karmas f or his purpose. Go d manip ulates t he fruits of k arma but he does not add or ta ke aw ay from it. The subconscious of man is a warehouse of good and bad karma. Iswara ch ooses from this wa rehouse wh at he sees will best suit the spiritu al evolution at the time of each man, whether pl easant or pa inful. Thus ther e is nothing arbitrary. Q: In Upadesa Saram you say that karma be ars fruit by the ordinance of God [karta]. Does this mea n that we r eap the 129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman consequences of karma solely because God wills it? A: In this ve rse karta [God] means Iswara. He is the one who distrib utes th e fruits of ac tions to each person according to his k arma. That means th at he is th e manifest Bra hman. The real Brahman is unm anifest and without motio n. It is only the manifest Brahma n that is name d as Iswara. He gives th e fruit to each person according to his ac tions [karma]. That mea ns that Isw ara is only an agent and that he gives w ages according to the labour done. That is all. Without this sakti [pow er] of Isw ara, this karma wo uld not take pla ce. Th at is why karma is sai d to be on its ow n, inert. Q: The present e xperiences are the result of past ka rma. If we k now the mistak es committed before, we ca n rectify them. A: If one mistak e is rectifie d there yet remains t he wh ole sa nchita ka rma from former birth s which is going to gi ve you innumera ble birt hs. So that is not the procedure. The more you prune a plant, the more vi gorously it grows. The more you rectify your karma, the more it accumulates. Find th e root of k arma an d cut it off. Q: Does the karma th eory mean that the worl d is the result of action and reaction? If so, acti on and reaction of w hat? A: Until realization th ere will be karma, that is action and reaction. After realization th ere will be no karma and no world. Q: If I am no t the b ody why am I responsible for th e consequences of my good and bad actions? A: If you are not the b ody and do not have the idea ‘I am the d oer’, the consequences of your go od or bad actions will not affect you. Why do you say about th e actions th e body performs ‘I do this’ or ‘I did th at’? As lo ng as you ide ntify yourself with the body like th at you are a ffected by the consequences of th e actions, th at is to say, while you identify with th e body you accumulate g ood and bad karma. , Q: But si nce I am not the body I am not really responsible for the c onsequences of g ood or b ad actions. A: If you are not, why do you bother ab out the question? Q: In some places it is stat ed that human effort is the s ource of all stre ngth and that it can even transcend karma. In others it is said that it is all di vine grace. It is not clear which of th em is correct. A: Yes, some sc hools of ph ilosophy say that there is no God other tha n the k armas of th e previous birth, that th e karma done in th e present birt h in accordance wit h the scri ptures is known as purushakara [human eff ort], that the previous and present ka rmas meet for a head-on fight like rams and that th e one that is we aker gets eliminate d. That is why these people say that on e should strengthen purushakara. If you as k such people what the ori gin of ka rma is, they say that su ch a question is not be raised as it is like the eter nal qu estion, ‘Which is earlier, th e seed or th e tree?’ Debates such as this a re mere ar guments w hich c an never arri ve at th e final truth. Th at is why I say first fin d out w ho you are. If one asks ‘Who am I? How di d I get this d osha [fault] of life?’, the ‘I’ will subside and one will re alize th e Self. If one does this properly the idea of d osha will be eliminate d and peace will be obtained. Wh y even obtained? The Self remains a s it is. The e ssence of karma is to kn ow the trut h of oneself by enquiring ‘Who am I, the doer, who begins to do karmas? ’ Unless the d oer of karmas, the ego, is annihilated through enquiry, the perfect peace of supreme bliss, which is the result of karma yoga, cannot be achieved. Q: Can people wipe o ut the consequences of t heir ba d actions by doing mantras or j apa or will they necessarily have to experience them? A: If the feeling ‘I am doing japa’ is not there, the b ad actions committed by a man will no t stick to him. If the feeling ‘I am do ing the j apa’ is ther e, the consequences of ba d actions will pe rsist. Q: Does not punya [merit accumul ated fr om virtuous acts] extinguish papa [demerit accumulated from sinful acts]? A: So long as the f eeling ‘I am do ing’ is there, on e must experience the r esult of on e’s acts, wh ether th ey are good or bad. How is it possible to wi pe out one act with a nother? When the feeling t hat ‘1 am doing’ is lost, nothing affects a 130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman man. Unless one realis es the Self, the feeling ‘I am doing’ will never vanish. For one who realise s the Self where is the need for j apa? Where is the need for tapas? Owing to th e force of pr arabdha life go es on, but he who has realized the Self do es not wish f or anything. Prarabdha karma is of t hree c ategories, ichha, anichha and parechha [perso nally desired, without desire and due to others’ de sire]. For the o ne who has realized the Self, there is no ichha- p rarabdha but the two others, anichha and parechha, remain. Whate ver a jnani does is for others only. If there a re thin gs to be done by him for oth ers, he d oes them but th e results do not affe ct him. Whatev er be the actions th at such people do, th ere is no punya and no papa attached to them. But th ey do only what is proper according t o the accepted standard of th e world – nothing el se. Those wh o know that wh at is to b e experienced by them in this life is on ly what is already destined in th eir prarabdha will never feel perturbed about w hat is to be e xperienced. Kn ow that all on e’s experiences will be thrust upon one whether one wills th em or not. Q: The realized man h as no further karma. He is no t bound by his karma. Why should he still remain within his b ody? A: Who a sks this q uestion? Is it the realized man o r the ajnani? Why should you bother wh at the jnani does or w hy he does anything? Look aft er yourself. Yo u are n ow under the impre ssion you are th e body and so you think th at the jnani also h as a b ody. Does the j nani say he has a body? He may look to you as if he has a b ody and he may appear to be doing thi ngs with th e body, as others do, b ut he himself knows that he is bo diless. Th e burnt rope still looks lik e a rope, but it ca n’t ser ve as a rope if you try to bind anything with it. A jnani is like th at – he may look like other people, but this is only an outer ap pearance. So long as one identifies on eself with the b ody, all this is difficult to un derstand. That is why it is sometimes sai d in reply to such questions, ‘The b ody of the jnani will continue till the for ce of prarabdha wor ks itself out, an d after the p rarabdha is ex hausted it will dr op off.’ An illustr ation mad e use of in this connection is that of a n arrow alre ady discharged whic h will continue to advance and strike its targ et. But the truth is the jnani has transcended all karmas, including the p rarabdha karma, and he is no t bound by the body or its karmas. Not ev en an iota of pr arabdha exists for those wh o uninterruptedly attend to the s pace of co nsciousness, whi ch alw ays shines as ‘I am’, which is not confined in the vast physical space, an d which p ervades ev erywhere with out limitations. Such alone is the mea ning of the a ncient saying, ‘There is no fate f or those who reach or e xperience the heavens.’ Q: If a thi ng come s to me with out any planning or working for it and I en joy it, will there be no bad consequences from it? A: It is no t so. Every act must ha ve its co nsequences. If anything c omes your way by reason of prarabdha, you ca n’t help it. If you take wh at comes, with out any special attachment, and without any desire for more of it or for a repetition o f it, it will not harm you by leading to furt her birth s. On the ot her hand, if you enjoy it with great attachment an d naturally desire for more o f it, it is bo und to le ad to more an d more birt hs. Q: According to the a strolo gical science, predictions ar e made a bout comin g events taking into ac count th e influ ence of the stars. Is that tru e? A: So long as you have the fe eling of egotism all that is tru e. When th at egotism gets destroyed all th at is untrue. Q: Does it mean that astrolo gy won’t be true in th e case of th ose w hose egotism is destroyed ? A: Who is th ere left to say it won’t be true? There will be seeing on ly if ther e is one who sees. In the case of th ose w hose egotism is destroyed, even if they appear to s ee they do not really see. Destiny is the r esult of pa st acti on. It concerns the body. Let the b ody act as may suit it. Why are you concerned with it? Why do you pay attention to it? Should anything h appen, it happens as th e result of one’s past actions, of divine will and of other fact ors. Q: The present is sai d to be d ue to past karma. Can we transcend the past ka rma by our free will no w? 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Ramana Maharshi – Be As You Are – by David Godman A: See what the present is. If you do this you will understand what is aff ected by or has a past or a fut ure, what is ever-present an d always free and what remains un affected by the past or fut ure or by any past karma. Q: Is there su ch a thing a s free will ? A: Whose will is it? So lon g as th ere is the s ense of do ership, ther e is the sense of enjoyment and of individual will. But if this sense is lost thr ough the practice of vi chara, the d ivine will will act and guide the course of ev ents. Fate is overcome by jnana, Self-k nowledge, which is beyond will and fate. Q: I can understand that the outstanding events in a man’s life, such as his c ountry, nationality, family, career o r professi on, marriag e, death, etc., are all pr edestine d by his karma, bu t can it be that all the d etails of hi s life, do wn to the minut est, have already been determine d?

Can it be that it was alre ady decided that o n such and such a day, at such and such an h our, I should move t he fan like this an d put it down here? A: Certainly. Whate ver this b ody is to do and whatever experiences it is to p ass through was alre ady decided wh en it came int o existence. Q: What becomes th en of man’ s freedom and responsibilit y for his a ctions? A: The only freedom man ha s is to strive f or and acquire the jnana which will en able him not to id entify himself with the body. The b ody will go through the acti ons rendered inevitabl e by prarabdha and a man is free eith er to ide ntify himself with the b ody and be attached to th e fruits of its actions, or to be detached fr om it and be a mere witn ess of its activities. Q: So fre e will is a m yth? A: Free will holds the field in a ssociation with indi viduality . As lon g as in dividuality lasts there is free will. All the scriptures are based on this fact an d they advise dire cting t he fre e will in th e right ch annel. Find ou t to whom free will or d estiny matters. Find o ut wh ere th ey come from, and abide in their so urce. If you do this, bot h of th em are transcended. That is the o nly purpose of discussing these questions. To w hom do these questions aris e? Find o ut and be at peace. Q: If wh at is destined to h appen will happen, is there a ny use in p rayer or eff ort or sh ould we ju st remain i dle? A: There are only two ways to conquer destiny or be independent o f it. One is to e nquire for whom is this destiny and discover th at only the ego is bo und by destiny and not the Self, an d that the ego is no n-existent. The other way is to kill the ego by completely surrendering to the Lor d, by realising o ne’s helplessness and saying all th e time, ‘Not I but thou, O Lord’, gi ving u p all se nse of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ a nd leaving it to the Lor d to do what he likes with you. Surrender can never be regarded as com plete so long as the d evotee wants this or that fr om the Lor d. True surrender is lo ve of God for th e sake of lo ve and nothing els e, not even for the s ake of liber ation. In ot her w ords, com plete eff acement of the ego is necessary to conquer destiny, whether you ac hieve this eff acement through self-en quiry or through bhakti marga. 132"}]
