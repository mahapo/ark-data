It deals with one of the most significant andenduring fault lines in science and philosophy. For well over a century, therehave been strongly divided opinions about the existence of psychic phenomena,such as telepathy. The passions aroused by this argument are quite out ofproportion to the phenomena under dispute. They stem from deeply held worldviewsand belief systems. They also raise fundamental questions about the nature ofscience itself. This debate, and the present state of parapsychology, arebrilliantly summarized in this book. Chris Carter puts his argument in awell-documented historical context, without which the present controversies makeno sense.The kind of skepticism Carter is writing about is not the normal healthy kind onwhich all science depends, but rather it arises from a belief that the existenceof psychic phenomena is impossible; they contradict the established principlesof science, and if they were to exist they would overthrow science as we knowit, causing chaos and confusion. Therefore, anyone who produces positiveevidence supporting their existence is guilty of error, wishful thinking,self-delusion, or fraud. This belief makes the very investigation of psychicphenomena taboo and treats those who investigate them as charlatans or heretics.Although some committed skeptics behave as if they are engaged in a holy war, inthis debate there is no clear correlation with religious belief or lack of it.Among those who investigate psi phenomena are atheists, agnostics, and followersof religious paths. But the ranks of committed skeptics also include religiousbelievers, agnostics, and atheists.As Carter shows so convincingly in this book, the question of the reality of psiphenomena is not primarily about evidence but about the interpretation ofevidence; it is about frameworks of understanding, or what Thomas Kuhn, thehistorian of science, called paradigms. I am sure Carter is right.I have myself spent many years investigating unexplained phenomena, such astelepathy in animals and in people. At first, I naively believed that this wasjust a matter of doing properly controlled experiments and collecting evidence.I soon found that for committed skeptics this is not the issue. Some dismiss allthe evidence out of hand, convinced in advance that it must be flawed ordefective. Those who do look at the evidence have the intention of finding asmany flaws as they can, but even if they can’t find them they brush aside theevidence anyway, assuming that fatal errors will come to light later on.The most common tactic of committed skeptics is to try to prevent the evidencefrom being discussed in public at all. For example, in September 2006, Ipresented a paper on telephone telepathy at the Annual Festival of the BritishAssociation for the Advancement of Science. Our controlled experiment had shownthat people could, before answering the phone, correctly identify who wascalling (from a choice of four people) over 40 percent of the time, when asuccess rate of 25 percent would be expected by chance alone. The following day,in The Times and other leading newspapers, several prominent British skepticsdenounced the British Association for “lending credibility to maverick theorieson the paranormal” by allowing this talk to take place at all. One of them,Professor Peter Atkins, a chemist at Oxford University, was quoted as saying,“There is no reason to suppose that telepathy is anything more than acharlatan’s fantasy.”1 [32_endnote-title.html#enf1] Later the same day, he and Itook part in a debate on BBC Radio. He dismissed all the evidence I presented as“playing with statistics.” I then asked him if he had actually looked at theevidence, and he replied, “No, but I would be very suspicious of it.”As Carter shows, conflicts about frameworks of understanding are inherent withinscience itself. Since its beginnings in the sixteenth century, science grewthrough a series of rebellions against established worldviews. The Copernicanrevolution in astronomy was the first. The mechanistic revolution of theseventeenth century—with its dismissal of souls in nature, as previously taughtin all the medieval universities—was another great rebellion. But what startedas rebel movements in turn became the orthodoxies, propagated by scholars andtaught in universities. Subsequent revolutions, including the theory ofevolution in the nineteenth century and the relativity and quantum revolutionsin physics of the twentieth century, again broke away from an older orthodoxy tobecome a new orthodoxy.There is a similar tension within the Christian religion, which provided thecultural background to the growth of Western science. Christianity itself beganas a rebellion. Jesus rejected many of the standard tenets of the Jewishreligion into which he was born. His life was one of rebellion against theestablished religious authorities, the scribes and Pharisees, the chief priestsand the elders. But the religion established in his name in its turn becameorthodox, rejecting and persecuting heresies, only to be disturbed by furtherrebellions, most notably the Protestant Reformation. In the debate that Carterdocuments, the skeptics are the upholders of the established mechanistic order,and they help maintain a taboo against “the paranormal.” These skeptics come invarious forms, and it would probably not be too difficult to find parallels tothe chief priests and elders, concerned with political power and influence, andto the scribes and Pharisees, the zealous upholders of righteousness.This struggle has a strong emotional charge in the context of Western religiousand intellectual history. But now, in the twenty-first century, there are manyscientists of non-Western origin, including those from India, China, Africa, andthe Middle East—especially the Arab countries. Western history is not theirhistory, nor are the strong emotions aroused by psi phenomena ones with whichthey can easily identify. In most parts of the world, even including Westernindustrial societies, most people take for granted the existence of telepathyand other psychic phenomena and are surprised to discover that some people denytheir existence so vehemently.From my own experience talking to scientists and giving seminars in scientificinstitutions, dogmatic skeptics are a minority within the scientific community.Most scientists are curious and open-minded, if only because they themselves orpeople they know well have had experiences that suggest the reality of psiphenomena. Nevertheless, almost all scientists are aware of the taboo, and theopen-minded tend to keep their interests private, fearing scorn or ridicule ifthey discuss them openly with their colleagues.I believe that for the majority of the scientific community, in spite of theappearances created by vociferous skeptics, what counts more than polemics isevidence. In the end, the question of whether or not psi phenomena occur, andhow they might be explained, depends on evidence and on research.No one knows how this debate will end or how long it will take forparapsychological investigations to become more widely known and accepted. Noone knows how big a change they will make to science itself, or how far theywill expand its framework. But the conditions are good, and an intensifyingdebate about the nature of consciousness makes the evidence from parapsychologymore relevant than ever before.This is one of the longest-running debates in the history of science, butchanges could soon come faster than most people think possible. Science andPsychic Phenomena is an invaluable guide to what is going on. It is essentialreading for anyone who wants to be part of a scientific revolution in themaking.RUPERT SHELDRAKE, PH.D., is a former research fellow of the Royal Society andformer director of studies in biochemistry and cell biology at Clare College,Cambridge University.

After long deliberationsand examination of much evidence, the conclusion reached by the committee wasthat with which they started: there are no such things as hot stones that havefallen from the sky because there are no stones in the sky to fall. Reports ofthe phenomena must have other explanations—delusionary “visions,” stones heatedafter being struck by lightning, stones borne aloft by whirlwinds or volcaniceruptions, and so forth. So great was the prestige of the committee and soconvincing its arguments that museums all over Western Europe threw away theirmeteorite specimens. As a result, there are very few preserved meteoritespecimens that date prior to 1790.Meteorites were dismissed as superstitions lingering from a time when Jove wasthought to punish errant mortals by hurtling his thunderbolts at them. But whenevidence of their reality was eventually conceded— in 1803, following anotherreport from the Academy—scientists did not learn humility. They merelycongratulated themselves for correcting the errors of their predecessors.a[38_notes.html#a1]In 1831 the French Academy appointed another committee, this one to investigatereports of what is now called clairvoyance—correct perception of objects orevents not accessible to one’s sense organs at the time of apprehension. Much tothe surprise of many Academy members, the committee reported that clairvoyancehad, in fact, been satisfactorily demonstrated.b [38_notes.html#a2] But unlikemeteorites, the Academy did not finally concede that clairvoyance was more thanjust silly superstition. The mechanistic science of Galileo and Newton simplycould not accommodate such phenomena. So the report was set aside and ignored.THE STRANGE TRIALS OF HENRY SLADEForty-five years later, a bizarre trial divided London and attractedinternational attention. It all started in the summer of 1876 when the Americanpsychic Henry Slade visited some friends in London and held séances with severalprominent townspeople. At these séances Slade would demonstrate his apparentpsychic powers, which would include the movement of untouched objects, thedisappearance and reappearance of objects, and the tying of knots in untouchedendless cords.But what got Slade into trouble was his most popular skill: that of seeminglyproducing automatic writing on a slate. Slade would take a child’s slate, put acrumb of pencil lead on it, and hold it face up under the flap of a table, withhis fingers under the back of the slate, and his thumb on top of the table flap.After a few seconds, scraping noises would be heard, and a scrawled messagewould be found on the slate. Slade had been tested in America by Robert Collyer,and although Collyer found the messages often trivial and sometimes ridiculous,he was satisfied that they could not have been produced by any trick.Shortly after arriving in England, Slade was tested by August Cox on behalf ofthe Psychological Society Cox had founded. Although anxious to expose cheats,Cox was also unable to find any fault with Slade. The room, he reported, wassunlit; in addition to slate writing, the inexplicable movement of large andsmall objects was said to have occurred. A few days later, Slade was tested byDr. Carter Blake, the former secretary of the Anthropological Society, who alsopronounced that he considered Slade genuine.All of this was too much for Edwin Ray Lankester, the young laboratory assistantto the famous zoologist and skeptic Thomas Henry Huxley. Apparently eager toimpress his heroes Charles Darwin and Thomas Huxley, Lankester and his fellowmedical student Horatio Donkin visited Slade, pretending to be believers. Duringa séance, Lankester claimed that he had suddenly snatched a slate out of Slade’shands before the “spirit” could begin to write and had found a message on it.Slade claimed in a letter to The Times that the writing had, in fact, been heardbefore the slate was snatched away. But Donkin denied this, and Slade wascharged with violating the Vagrancy Act, an old law designed to protect thepublic from traveling palm readers and sleight-of-hand artists.Throughout the fall of 1876, London buzzed with talk of the Slade trial. Thecourtroom was packed with Slade’s supporters and detractors, and The Timescarried trial transcripts day after day. The trial also divided the scientificcommunity: Darwin contributed ten pounds to the prosecution (a substantial sumin those days), while his cofounder of the theory of evolution, Alfred RussellWallace, was set to testify as star witness for the defense.By common consent, the legal evidence against Slade was weak. Even a historianfavorably disposed toward Lankester and Donkin wrote thatboth scientists turned out to be terrible witnesses; their observational skills,developed in anatomy and physiology labs, were useless in detecting fraud byprofessional cheats. . . . Indeed, Lankester and Donkin apparently could notagree on anything much beyond their charge that Slade was an imposter.1[32_endnote-title.html#enin1]The two had to admit they could not explain how Slade’s tricks wereaccomplished. All they were prepared to assert with confidence was that theymust have been tricks, because the conjuror John Maskelyne had shown them howthe table had been designed for that purpose. It had specially constructedflaps, movable bars, and wedges, expressly designed to hold the slate, leavingSlade’s fingers free to write on it, and to produce raps during the séances.The table itself was produced as an exhibit, and Maskelyne was called as awitness. He then proceeded to demonstrate how he thought the trick must havebeen done: with the aid of a pencil shaped like a thimble. The prosecutionpointed out that the table had been constructed according to the specificationsof Slade’s assistant, who had been prosecuted with him, and so conspiracy wasadded to the charge of vagrancy.This was a blow to the defense, but soon there was a new twist in the trial. Theprosecution subpoenaed R. H. Hutton as a witness. Hutton was the shrewd,skeptical editor of the Spectator, a man with an unblemished reputation, whocould be counted upon to testify accurately to whatever he had seen. He hadattended séances, he told the court, and although he had doubts about some ofthe things he had seen, there were many that he could not account for by sleightof hand. The testimony of the foreman carpenter, on whose premises the table hadbeen made, also turned out to be an embarrassment for the prosecution. Heconfirmed that the table had indeed been constructed to a particularspecification—for instance, to have one support for each flap instead of two—butit was difficult to see how this could help a conjuror. What about the wedges,which Maskelyne alleged had been used to make the raps? The carpenter had toadmit that these had not been in the specifications but had to be inserted afterthe table had been made, to compensate for some faulty workmanship.The high point of the trial was the testimony of Wallace for the defense. Hisintegrity and candor were well-known. Wallace testified that the effects he hadobserved could not have been produced by sleight of hand, although he refused tospeculate on whether the slate writings were caused by spirits.In his summation, Slade’s attorney argued that there was no convincing evidenceagainst his client. The prosecution had not proved that the table was rigged,and Maskelyne’s demonstrations of how the trick could have been done wereirrelevant. The timing of the answer’s appearance proved nothing about itsorigin, and Lankester and Donkin could not even agree on exactly what they hadseen during the séance. Finally, the testimony of such an eminent scientist asWallace should be considered at least as credible as that of young Lankester.But nothing could save the accused. The judge ruled that Slade must be guilty,since “according to the well-known course of nature” there could be no otherexplanation. Three months’ hard labor was the sentence.Two months later, the Court of Appeal rejected the verdict, because the words bypalmistry or otherwise had inadvertently been omitted from the indictment.Lankester announced that he would initiate a fresh prosecution, putting Slade ina difficult situation. If he left for Germany, accepting an invitation to visit,his enemies would allege that he was a fugitive from justice. Before his trial,Slade had been urged by his friends to leave England, on the grounds that hewould not receive a fair trial; Slade had refused. But now he had been shownthat an English court could not give him a fair trial, as a judge had ruledthat, regardless of the evidence, he must be guilty since the alleged phenomenawere contrary to the laws of nature. Seeing no hope of escaping conviction,Slade left for Germany. He wrote to Lankester, offering to come back to Englandto be tested, but only if Lankester would end his legal crusade. Lankester didnot reply, and Slade did not return.THE PHYSICISTS TEST SLADEThis was not the end of Slade’s story. He had been invited to Germany by JohannZollner, professor of physics and astronomy. Zollner had heard of Slade’spredicament and of Slade’s insistence that he could prove his innocence byduplicating his feats before a scientific body. Intrigued, Zollner decided totake up the challenge.Although only in his early forties, Zollner had already acquired aninternational reputation for his work, some of which centered on the possibilityof a fourth spatial dimension. Nothing in mathematics or theoretical physicsexcluded that possibility—but what Zollner needed was empirical evidence. Themost convincing evidence, he thought, would be “the transport of material bodiesfrom a space enclosed on every side.”To understand why, consider the analogy of beings existing on a flat plane,limited to a world of only two spatial dimensions. In such a world, a square ora circle would appear to be a sealed container. Once inside, it would seemimpossible to the two-dimensional beings that an object would be able to escape,unless the square or circular-shaped container was opened. But if the enclosedobject could move in the third spatial dimension, it could be raisedperpendicularly to the plane, passed over, and let down on the other side of thecontainer. To the inhabitants of this flat land, it would appear as though theobject had suddenly vanished, and then reappeared outside the container. Theexistence of a third spatial dimension would be, for such beings, asincomprehensible as a fourth spatial dimension seems to us.Since Zollner wanted to find empirical evidence to support his theories, itcould be argued that he was predisposed in Slade’s favor, and thereforesusceptible to his guile. But some of Zollner’s best work had been done inresearch into sensory illusions, so he was no innocent. He shrewdly realizedthat he would need independent testimony, and so he asked some of his colleaguesto collaborate with him. These included Gustav Fechner, professor of physics andpsychology, and Wilhelm Weber, who, along with Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss, hadbeen one of the leading innovators in electromagnetism. (Today, the officialunit of magnetism, the “weber,” is named after him.)The tests began with slate writing and then moved on to tests with a compassneedle, which, after some difficulty, Slade apparently caused to oscillate.Other phenomena reported included a string tying itself in knots, objects movingout of sealed containers, and a seashell passing through a table, after which itwas found to be hot to the touch, almost too hot to hold.But critics pointed out thatscientists, because they are trained to trust their senses, are the worstpossible people to evaluate a magician. A magician is trained specifically todistract, deceive, and confuse those very senses. A scientist may carefullyobserve the magician’s right hand, but it is the left hand that secretlyperforms the trick. . . . [O]nly another magician is clever enough to detect thesleight-of-hand tricks of a fellow magician. Only a thief can catch a thief.2[32_endnote-title.html#enin2]Accordingly, Slade was also tested by several professional magicians, the mostfamous among them Samuel Bellachini. After testing Slade in a series ofsittings, Bellachini provided Slade with a witnessed affidavit, claiming thatthe phenomena were “impossible” to produce with sleight of hand.c[38_notes.html#a3]An astonishing number of the most prominent physicists of the day expressedinterest in Zollner’s work with Slade, including William Crookes, inventor ofthe cathode ray tube, which until recently was used in television and computermonitors; J. J. Thomson, who won the Nobel Prize in 1906 for the discovery ofthe electron; and Lord Rayleigh, considered one of the greatest physicists ofthe late nineteenth century, and winner of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1904.For their efforts in investigating these and other unusual phenomena, these menwere criticized and ridiculed mercilessly by their colleagues.d[38_notes.html#a4] One particularly savage piece of criticism, which appeared inthe science quarterly Bedrock, was leveled at prominent physicists WilliamBarrett and Oliver Lodge, for their work in telepathy. In part, it read:It is not necessary either to regard the phenomena of so-called telepathy asinexplicable or to regard the mental condition of Sir W. F. Barrett and SirOliver Lodge as indistinguishable from idiocy. There is a third possibility. Thewill to believe has made them ready to accept evidence obtained under conditionswhich they would recognize to be unsound if they had been trained inexperimental psychology.3 [32_endnote-title.html#enin3]Of course, Barrett and Lodge could easily have retorted that the will todisbelieve made the critics ready to reject evidence obtained under conditionsthey would recognize to be sound if they had been trained in experimentalphysics or psychology.THE NEW QUANTUM CONTROVERSYOne hundred twenty-five years after Slade’s trial, another storm was brewing. Inthe intervening period, physics had undergone two major revolutions. First,Einstein introduced his theory of relativity; then, shortly afterward, came theeven more fundamental revision known as quantum mechanics. Newtonian physics hadbeen overthrown by two new upstarts, yet the subject matter of parapsychologywas just as controversial as ever. And a few daring physicists were stillstirring up that controversy.In September 2001, Britain’s Royal Mail decided to honor the hundredthanniversary of the Nobel Prize by asking a British winner of each of the sixdifferent Nobel Prize categories—physics, chemistry, medicine, peace,literature, and economics—to write a small article about the implications ofresearch in their field. Brian Josephson, who won the prize in 1973 for his workin quantum physics, contributed the following short article:Physicists attempt to reduce the complexity of nature to a single unifyingtheory, of which the most successful and universal, the quantum theory, has beenassociated with several Nobel prizes, for example those to Dirac and Heisenberg.Max Planck’s original attempts a hundred years ago to explain the precise amountof energy radiated by hot bodies began a process of capturing in mathematicalform a mysterious, elusive world containing ‘spooky interactions at a distance’,real enough however to lead to inventions such as the laser and transistor.Quantum theory is now being fruitfully combined with theories of information andcomputation. These developments may lead to an explanation of processes stillnot understood within conventional science such as telepathy, an area whereBritain is at the forefront of research.e [38_notes.html#a5]The last sentence of this article ignited a firestorm of controversy. It hadbeen over a century since Zollner worked with Slade, but it was clear that evenin the twenty-first century a prominent scientist still could not endorseresearch into telepathy—the direct communication between minds that is said tooccur independently of the sense organs—without arousing strong emotions in manyof his colleagues. The first to denounce Josephson in print was David Deutsch,quantum physics expert at Oxford University. “It is utter rubbish,” Deutschsputtered to the London newspaper The Observer. “Telepathy simply does notexist. The Royal Mail has let itself be hoodwinked into supporting ideas thatare complete nonsense. The evidence for the existence of telepathy isappalling.”4 [32_endnote-title.html#enin4]f [38_notes.html#a6] The scienceeditor of The Observer even suggested patronizingly that Josephson had “gone offthe rails.”The controversy was not confined to Britain. Professor Herbert Kroemer of SantaBarbara University, California, was quoted as saying:I am highly skeptical. Few of us believe telepathy exists, nor do we thinkphysics can explain it. It also seems wrong for your Royal Mail to get involved.Certainly, if the US postal services did something like this, a lot of us wouldbe very angry.5 [32_endnote-title.html#enin5]But in the controversy that followed, other prominent scientists were quoted asexpressing opinions supporting Josephson’s position. Bernard Carr, a cosmologistat the University of London, argued that even if one regards the probability ofextrasensory perception being real as small, “its significance if establishedwould be so immense that it is surely worth investing some effort into studyingit.”6 [32_endnote-title.html#enin6]In an article in Physics World, Carr defended Josephson and other physicistsinterested in telepathy, explaining that the interaction between mind and matteris one of the main reasons why some physicists are interested in the paranormal.Quantum mechanics, after all, is the first theory in physics in which the roleof the observer has to be taken into account. You cannot separate the observerfrom the system being observed, although the precise role of consciousness inthis process remains controversial.7 [32_endnote-title.html#enin7]A few weeks later Josephson defended himself in a letter to The Observer, inwhich he pointed out that complete skeptical denial regarding the existence oftelepathy is by no means the rule among working scientists, contrary to whatsome skeptics would have us believe. In part, he wrote:Surveys show that a large proportion of scientists accept the possibility thattelepathy exists; if it appears that the contrary is the case, this is becausesuch scientists wisely keep quiet about their opinions when in scientificcompany.The problem is that scientists critical of this research do not give theirnormal careful attention to the scientific literature on the paranormal: it ismuch easier instead to accept official views or views of biased sceptics.The CIA’s Stargate Project provided clear evidence that people canintermittently pick up with their minds images of distant objects such asmilitary installations, sometimes with striking accuracy. The research arm ofthe project found that under controlled conditions the extent to which thisability exceeded chance guessing was statistically highly significant.There is much other supporting research: the views you present are uninformedones. Recently Henry Stapp of the University of California has given strongarguments for it being necessary to take mind into account in physics, whichopens up a whole field of possibilities; ironically, he also gives strongarguments against Deutsch’s many-worlds philosophy, which has no experimentalsupport whatever. My speculations in the brochure are by no means incompatiblewith current science. My contacts at Royal Mail do not consider they made anerror in allowing the statement to stand.Brian JosephsonDepartment of PhysicsUniversity of Cambridge8 [32_endnote-title.html#enin8]In the same issue Phillip Parker of the Royal Mail defended the Post Office’sdecision.Royal Mail was fully aware that Professor Josephson’s views in the Nobel Stampspresentation pack could cause a debate among physicists. This is why telepathywas referred to as an area ‘not understood by conventional science’. Six Nobellaureates were invited to write a personal reflection. Professor Josephson endedhis piece on Quantum Theory with a few words speculating on the possible futuredirection of this particular subject.The Nobel Stamps issued on 2 October celebrate 100 years of Nobel prizes. We aredelighted that six laureates made unique contributions to our pack.9[32_endnote-title.html#enin9]The controversy also played out over the airwaves. BBC radio confrontedJosephson with psychologist Nicholas Humphrey and conjuror James Randi, neitherof whom, it should be noted, are Nobel laureates, Fellows of the Royal Society,or even physicists.Randi was first quoted, in part, as saying, “There is no firm evidence for theexistence of telepathy, ESP, or whatever we want to call it, and I think it isthe refuge of scoundrels in many respects for them to turn to something likequantum mechanics, which uses a totally different language from the regularEnglish that we are accustomed to using from day to day.”Humphrey was more coherent: “Well, I think the idea that quantum physicsexplains the paranormal is an unnecessary idea, because there’s nothing toexplain. We haven’t got any evidence.”10 [32_endnote-title.html#enin10]Since reports of telepathy, clairvoyance, and so forth date back over at leasttwo thousand years, and since these phenomena have been studied experimentallyfor over one hundred years, the remark that “we haven’t got any evidence” mayseem somewhat surprising.It may be even more surprising to learn that this remark came from a formerholder of the Cambridge University Perrott-Warrick Fellowship for PsychicalResearch.g [38_notes.html#a7]Nothing, of course, was resolved in the brief exchange that followed. Humphreypatronizingly implied that Josephson “and other well-meaning physicists” arebeing fooled by conjuring tricksters if they believe in telepathy. In response,Josephson taunted Humphrey: “Now a few years ago he wrote a book . . . I lookedat the book very carefully and I believe I disposed of all the arguments. Ihaven’t heard any comeback from him.”“This isn’t the time to review my book!” Humphrey squealed. The psychologistthen proceeded to make some rather inaccurate remarks about the controversialrole of consciousness in quantum physics, and time ran out on the talk showbefore Josephson was allowed to respond.The issue was no more settled at the end of the radio talk show than it had been125 years earlier, at the end of Slade’s trial. Despite the fact that thecontroversy has now spanned three centuries, and has been carried on inscientific academies, courtrooms, academic journals, newspapers, and radiostations, the opponents and proponents of parapsychology seem just as implacablyopposed in the twenty-first century as they were in the nineteenth. Today, inthe world of science, nothing seems more controversial than parapsychology.Indeed, the story of parapsychology’s struggle for legitimacy is an epic talespanning centuries and continents, containing victories, sudden reversals,intrigue, scandals, heated arguments, wild accusations, ruined reputations, andsome of the most bizarre characters that have ever walked the earth.

[But] I do not believe the subject will make any progress unless we aresufficiently open-minded to accept the possibility of supernormal powers, andsufficiently critical to abandon claims shown to be false.HORACE BARLOW, PHYSIOLOGIST,CAMBRIDGE, APRIL 2000"},{"pageContent":"ONEOrigins of the DebateThe world is a battlefield of ideas, and the battle over the subject matter ofparapsychology has been raging for centuries. The first shots of the war overthe reality of the paranormal were fired almost three hundred years ago, andthey signaled the opening rounds of an exchange that continues to this day. Theskeptics often seem to be engaged in a kind of holy war, fueled by the beliefthat they alone are the last defenders of the citadel of science. Thisbattlefield of ideas is murkier than most, as some of the disputants fight notonly with logic and statistics but also with ridicule and charges of“pseudoscience,” incompetence, and fraud. However, the smoke is finallyclearing, and at last it is becoming possible to see what is left standing.Skepticism, meaning the practice of doubt, is a crucial component of thepractice of science. New and controversial claims must be subjected to critical,careful scrutiny before they are accepted into the scientific worldview. Throughthe practice of conjecture, prediction, testing, analysis, and debate, ourscientific understanding of the universe continually evolves. Critical thinkingis crucial if we are to minimize our chances of accepting unwarrantedconclusions.But skepticism is a double-edged sword that can be applied to any claim,including the claims of the skeptics. The philosopher Curt Ducasse made thispoint forcefully:Although the evidence offered by addicts of the marvelous for the reality of thephenomena they accept must be critically examined, it is equally necessary onthe other side to scrutinize just as closely and critically the skeptic’sallegations of fraud, or of malobservation, or of misinterpretation of what wasobserved, or of hypnotically induced hallucinations. For there is likely to bejust as much wishful thinking, prejudice, emotion, snap judgment, naïveté, andintellectual dishonesty on the side of orthodoxy, of skepticism, and ofconservatism, as on the side of hunger for and belief in the marvelous.1[32_endnote-title.html#c1e1]a [38_notes.html#one1]This book is a critical examination of skeptical claims regarding so-calledparanormal phenomena. The term paranormal phenomena encompasses four other maincategories of phenomena as well as evidence for the survival of bodily death:(1) telepathy—a direct communication between minds that occurs independently ofthe sense organs and regardless of distance or obstacles; (2)clairvoyance—correct perception of objects or events not accessible to one’ssense organs at the time of apprehension; (3) precognition—information perceivedabout future events without the use of ordinary means; and (4) psychokinesis—thedirect action of mind upon matter, independent of muscles and limbs. The firstthree phenomena are referred to together as extrasensory perception (ESP), andthe last one is usually abbreviated as PK. All four are referred to collectivelyas psi phenomena, or simply as psi (pronounced “sigh”)—the second last letter ofthe Greek alphabet.Research into the question of survival is somewhat out of fashion in theparapsychology community today, as most researchers in the field spend theirtime designing and performing experiments in order to test theories oftelepathy, clairvoyance, and psychokinesis. The evidence for survival will beassessed in the second and third books in this series, in which the discussionof the survival hypothesis is defended on three grounds. The first ishistorical: the early psychic researchers were much more concerned about thesurvival question than with telepathy and other forms of psi. The second ispsychological: evidence for the survival of consciousness past the point ofbiological death is surely of great interest to most of humankind. And the thirdis simply the fact that the skeptics do not shy away from criticizing the claimsof those who profess to offer evidence of survival, and so I consider the topicfair game.BASIS OF THE CONTROVERSYWebster’s dictionary defines prima facie evidence as “evidence having such adegree of probability that it must prevail unless the contrary be proved.” As wewill see, in terms of sheer quantity and variety, the evidence in favor of thepsi and survival hypotheses certainly does seem to provide strong prima faciecases in their favor. However, many alternative explanations have been proposed,explanations that account for this evidence in terms that do not require theexistence of psi or the survival of bodily death. So, if we are to make up ourminds about the reality of psi and survival on rational grounds, then we mustdemonstrate that one set of these explanations is more likely to be true thanthe other.In order to understand the controversy, it is crucial to realize that many ofthe arguments about psi phenomena are not really about the evidence, as much asthey are about the underlying preconceptions of the disputants. The fact thatthere is evidence in the form of numerous reports is not disputed by those whohave taken the trouble to investigate these matters: what is disputed is theinterpretation of this evidence. Believers and disbelievers tend to bring adifferent set of preconceptions to the table. Consequently, different people canexamine the same evidence yet come to radically differentconclusions—conclusions that usually support their initial preconceptions. Whenpeople are faced with seemingly compelling evidence that conflicts withlong-held preconceived notions, they only rarely change their opinions withease. This is because changing opinions would not merely mean accepting thereality of the phenomena in question: it would also mean changing one’s deeplyheld preconceptions.When people are faced with a conflict between belief and evidence, many arelikely to enter into a state psychologists have termed cognitive dissonance.This is an uncomfortable state of tension that can only be relieved by changingone’s preconceptions, or by dismissing the objectionable evidence. Needless tosay, since the preconceived opinions we bring to the table are formed over alifetime on the basis of our unique experiences, education, and personalities,changing them is rarely easy.This means that any examination of the dispute over the reality of psi phenomenacannot simply be an examination of the evidence. As Professor Henry Bauer haswritten:In considering the available evidence we usually fail to make the cruciallyimportant distinction between weight of evidence adequate to support one’s ownbelief and weight of evidence adequate to convince others. Since preconceptionsvary, estimates of plausibility also vary: what seems likely to some seems quiteunlikely to others. When something occurs that seems to us plausible, we acceptit even on quite slender evidence; when however a thing seems implausible to us,we demand a mass of proof before accepting it and may even then remainunconvinced.2 [32_endnote-title.html#c1e2]In addition to examining the evidence, it is necessary to critically examine thedifferent philosophic and scientific assumptions underlying acceptance andrejection of the evidence. It is these assumptions that are in dispute, more sothan the evidence itself. That a mass of favorable evidence exists can hardly bedisputed if one has taken the trouble to look for it. Whether or not theconclusions to which the evidence seems to point should be accepted depends uponthe validity of the skeptical objections and, by implication, of theirunderlying philosophic and scientific assumptions.As Bauer points out, in order to make sense of the arguments over psi phenomena,“one needs to realize that the antagonists are always to a certain extenttalking past one another: the manifest issue may be a proximate cause of theargument, but the real cause is a different set of preconceptions.”3[32_endnote-title.html#c1e3] There are few subjects that generate as muchpassion among both scientists and laypersons as parapsychology. This is becausean examination of the evidence the parapsychologists present brings usface-to-face with our most profound beliefs concerning the nature of humanbeings and our relationship with the world. The opinions we form on the subjectof parapsychology have implications for our opinions concerning the relationshipof mind with matter, and even the nature of reality itself. No small wonder thenthat the debate over parapsychology has been fought with the passion of a holywar.It should also be stressed that just because the disputants are always to acertain extent “talking past one another,” this does not mean that they cannotsomehow understand each other, or that it is not possible to arrive at arational conclusion to the debate. The idea that such opposing positions aresomehow “equally valid” is one that should be soundly rejected. The philosopherof science Karl Popper referred to this idea as the “myth of the framework,” anddismissed as “dangerous dogma” the idea that we are hopelessly trapped in aprison built of our preconceptions:I do admit that at any moment we are prisoners caught in the framework of ourtheories; our expectations; our past experiences; our language. But we areprisoners in a Pickwickian sense; if we try, we can break out of our frameworkat any time. Admittedly, we shall find ourselves again in a framework, but itwill be a better and roomier one; and we can at any moment break out of itagain.4 [32_endnote-title.html#c1e4]The different preconceptions of researchers and skeptics may be thought of as“frameworks,” but then the questions are: Have the scientists and philosopherswho endorse psi research broken through into a better and roomier framework, oneable to accommodate psi phenomena? Or, on the contrary, have the skeptics brokenthrough to a framework that no longer has any place in it for psi phenomena, anymore than it has a place for faeries and leprechauns? As we shall see,scientific theories (and the philosophical ideas that are always developed intheir wake) have changed drastically over the last four hundred years. Ourframework has been enlarged again and again. Some would argue that it is nowlarge enough to accommodate the reality of psi; others would argue that thesebeliefs are relics from the past and have no place in the current scientificworldview.DEBATE ORIGINSUntil the eighteenth century, the great majority of philosophers and scientiststook for granted the existence of phenomena that could only be explained interms of a spirit world. These phenomena might operate in accordance with God’swill, or they might occur to serve the nefarious plans of Lucifer and hisdemons. A few individuals, such as witches, sorcerers, and alchemists, werethought to be able to induce these phenomena for better or for worse: to curethe sick, to see into the future, or to place a hex on someone. When thesepowers were wielded by a saintly individual, the results were deemed miraculous;on the other hand, the suspicion that these powers were being used for darkpurposes could result in someone being burned at the stake. Other sorts ofphenomena, such as glimpses of the future in dreams, were considered toocommonplace to be either miraculous or diabolic.Among educated people, all this changed with the dawn of the ScientificRevolution. This momentous mutation in human affairs spans the period betweenthe birth of Galileo in 1564 and the death of Newton in 1727. Scientificadvances during this period had the greatest impact on human affairs since theinvention of agriculture and the dawn of civilization. And this period gave riseto a new worldview that drew a sharp distinction between the natural and thesupernatural, between the normal and the paranormal.The culmination of this revolution was surely the publication of Newton’sPrincipia in 1687. Building upon the earlier works of Johannes Kepler andGalileo, Newton created a system that predicted the motions of the heavenlybodies with astonishing accuracy. No longer were comets considered portents ofdisaster: Newton and Edmond Halley calculated the orbits of certain comets andshowed that they were as obedient as the planets to the law of gravitation. Theuniverse was now viewed as a gigantic clockwork mechanism. There might still bea need for God to set the machine running—according to Newton the planets wereoriginally hurled by the hand of God—but once started, the solar system was keptgoing by its own momentum, and operated as a self-regulating machine inaccordance with inviolable laws. The rule of natural law had established itshold on people’s imaginations, and there seemed to be no room left in theuniverse for magic and sorcery.These views became prevalent in the eighteenth century, during what became knownas the Enlightenment, which can be thought of as the ideological aftermath ofthe Scientific Revolution. Its most salient feature was the rejection of dogmaand tradition in favor of the rule of reason in human affairs, and it was theprecursor of modern secular humanism. Inspired by the dazzling success of thenew physics, prominent spokespeople such as Denis Diderot and Voltaire arguedfor a new worldview based upon an uncompromising mechanism and determinism thatleft no room for any intervention of mind in nature, whether human or divine. Inthe previous century, René Descartes had written that the bodies of animals andmen were machines, governed entirely by the laws of physics. Animals he regardedas mindless automata, but men, he maintained, had a soul and were thus the soleexceptions in an otherwise deterministic universe. But his successors during theEnlightenment did not hesitate to ask whether human beings themselves might alsobe, in the final analysis, nothing more than self-regulating machines.One of the brightest stars of the Enlightenment was the Scottish philosopherDavid Hume, a contemporary of Diderot and Voltaire. As one biographer hasremarked, the eighteenth century “must have seemed to Hume like the dawning ofan era of opportunity: an age when human culture could at long last emerge fromthe darkness of superstition.”5 [32_endnote-title.html#c1e5] There were nomiracles, Hume argued in 1748, because miracles were contrary to the uniformexperience of mankind, “and as a uniform experience amounts to a proof, there ishere a direct and full proof, from the nature of the fact, against the existenceof any miracle.”Hume’s criticism was directed specifically toward religious miracles, but histwenty-first century followers apply this argument to those secular miraclesthat are today called paranormal events. In an earlier age, the fallacy of hisargument would have been obvious: miraculous events may not have been common,but they had been reported often enough to show that human experience had notbeen uniform. But by this time scientists longed for mechanistic certainties,and the assumption grew that there were natural laws that could not be brokenand that now mankind knew these laws. Miraculous events did not fit into the newscientific worldview.However, down through the ensuing centuries “miraculous” events, such as thoughttransference, second sight, spiritual healing, hauntings, and so forth,continued to be reported. But the science of Newton, Galileo, and Kepler hadgiven birth to a new metaphysics—philosophical assumptions about the nature ofreality—that simply could not accommodate the reality of these phenomena.Skepticism based on the Humean model had taken hold, and so these reports were,for the most part, simply dismissed as incredible. Lingering widespread beliefin the reality of these phenomena was considered to be the unfortunate legacy ofa superstitious, irrational, prescientific era.Parapsychology, which has its roots in the psychical research of the nineteenthcentury, is the scientific study of these “anomalous” phenomena, consideredanomalous by some in the sense that they seem to defy a mechanistic explanation.However, parapsychologists part company with the astrologers, palm readers, andother practitioners of the occult arts in the manner in which they treat theevidence, a manner which they claim is scientific. But the claim thatparapsychology is a science—or even that parapsychology has a subject matter toinvestigate—is, of course, controversial."},{"pageContent":"TWOThe Modern CriticsAt the present time, the opponents of parapsychology are those who seethemselves as heirs of the Enlightenment, guardians of rationality who must atall costs discredit any dangerous backsliding into superstition. To this end,they even resort to mockery, the weapon Voltaire so-often wielded against hisopponents. Although physics has changed in ways Newton could never have dreamedof, and although the “laws of nature” have been rewritten several times sincethe publication of the Principia, the modern skeptics still invoke theprinciples of Newtonian physics and other arguments literally straight out ofthe eighteenth century—such as those of the skeptical philosopher David Hume—toargue against the claims of parapsychology.1 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e1] Theyalso occasionally blur the distinction between parapsychology and the variousNew Age cults, whose adherents, for the most part, are simply not interested ina careful and critical examination of the evidence.Until the mid-1970s skeptics and debunkers of paranormal claims weredisorganized; they did not have a formal organization with which to advancetheir point of view. Serious skeptical opposition came almost entirely fromfreelance writers, such as Martin Gardner, who wrote in the preface to his 1957book Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science: “Not many books have beenwritten about modern pseudoscientists and their views.”2[32_endnote-title.html#c2e2] He knew of only two, with the most recent publishedin 1936. However, in the years following World War II, a number of books byauthors with favorable views on the paranormal were published, and with whatsome have termed the “occult revival” of the early 1970s, the pace of publishingin this area accelerated.This upsurge of interest in paranormal claims during the 1970s was not viewedfavorably by several individuals in different quarters. One such individual whothought the growing interest signaled a rise in irrationality was Paul Kurtz,then a philosopher at the State University of New York at Buffalo and editor ofThe Humanist (the bimonthly magazine of the American Humanist Association).Determined to do something about the rising popularity of astrology, Kurtzcollected 186 scientists’ signatures for a five-paragraph article titled“Objections to Astrology,” which was published in the September–October 1975issue of The Humanist, and released with much fanfare to the press. In part, thestatement read:One would imagine, in this day of widespread enlightenment and education, thatit would be unnecessary to debunk belief based on magic and superstition. Yet,acceptance of astrology pervades modern society. We are especially disturbed bythe uncritical dissemination of astrological charts, forecasts, and horoscopesby the media and by otherwise reputable newspapers, magazines, and bookpublishers. This can only contribute to the growth of irrationalism andobscurantism. We believe that the time has come to challenge directly, andforcefully, the pretentious claims of astrological charlatans.3[32_endnote-title.html#c2e3]The statement, which also asserted that astrology has “no scientificfoundation,” was favorably reported in the nation’s newspapers, with the NewYork Times giving the story front-page attention in its September 3, 1975,edition.Less noted was the objection of one famous nonsigner, celebrity astronomer CarlSagan, who wrote in a letter to The Humanist:I find myself unable to endorse the “Objections to Astrology” statement . . .not because I feel that astrology has any validity whatever, but because I feltand still feel that the tone of the statement is authoritarian. The fundamentalpoint is not that the origins of astrology are shrouded in superstition. This istrue as well for chemistry, medicine, and astronomy, to mention only three. Todiscuss the psychological motivations of those who believe in astrology seems tobe quite peripheral to the issue of its validity. That we can think of nomechanism for astrology is relevant but unconvincing. No mechanism was known,for example, for continental drift when it was proposed by Wegener.Nevertheless, we see that Wegener was right, and those who objected on thegrounds of unavailable mechanism were wrong.Statements contradicting borderline, folk, or pseudoscience that appear to havean authoritarian tone can do more damage than good. They never convince thosewho are flirting with pseudoscience but merely seem to confirm their impressionthat scientists are rigid and closed-minded.4 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e4]But the rhetoric of “Objections,” with its warnings of “the growth ofirrationalism and obscurantism,” would echo in future attacks on the paranormalin which Kurtz would play a role. With Kurtz as editor, The Humanist vigorouslycriticized paranormal ideas of all kinds, defined as everything from religiousfaith to popular occultism to the findings of academic parapsychology, andtreated them all as irrational superstition. Kurtz and his humanist associatesbelieved interest in unorthodox claims was indicative of hostility to scienceand criticized favorable coverage of any such claims as dangerously promotingirrationality and primitive superstition.However, there were other types of skeptics, such as sociologist of scienceMarcello Truzzi, publisher of The Zetetic, a newsletter that dealt with academicresearch into anomalies and the paranormal. Although a skeptic about the realityof many anomalous and paranormal phenomena, Truzzi did not regard interest insuch matters as itself proof of irrationality or hostility to science. On thecontrary, Truzzi stated in the September 1979 issue of Fate that some of thoseinterested in unorthodox phenomena were presenting their arguments in ways“amenable to investigation and justification just like any scientificstatement.” He envisioned The Zetetic as a forum in which anomalous andparanormal claims could be debated in an intellectually responsible fashion,with fair representation given to all points of view.Meanwhile, encouraged by the favorable media response to “Objections toAstrology,” Kurtz began to explore the idea of founding an organization tochallenge what he saw as the uncritical coverage of paranormal and occult ideasin television and print. One of the first prospective members he called wasTruzzi, who expressed his opposition to “Objections” and made it clear that hewas not a humanist. Nevertheless, Kurtz asked him if he would be cochairman ofthe committee Kurtz was trying to organize, and even suggested that The Zeteticcould be its official publication. Truzzi in turn sought assurances that the neworganization would not simply be a debunking operation but would take a moreopen-minded approach than that of The Humanist. With Kurtz’s reassurances thatthe group would separate itself from the magazine and have a diverse membership,Truzzi accepted the position of cochairman.The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal(CSICOP) was thus formed in 1976 at a meeting of the American HumanistAssociation. The expressed goals for CSICOP (pronounced PSI-cop) were indeedlaudable, as it pledged to pursue “objective and impartial inquiry” and stressedthat “the purpose of the committee is not to reject on a priori grounds,antecedent to inquiry, any or all such claims, but rather to examine themopenly, completely, objectively, and carefully.”5 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e5]No reasonable scientist could take issue with goals like these, and CSICOPachieved considerable credibility by quickly attracting prominent figures inscience and philosophy. Committee fellows included Antony Flew, philosopher;Carl Sagan, astronomer; B. F. Skinner, behavioral psychologist; W. V. Quine,Harvard philosopher; and others. Less prominent academics were put on a list of“scientific consultants.” But with the exception of Sagan, who had undertakensome research on UFO sightings and had written a critique of the radicalastrophysical theories of Immanuel Velikovsky, these eminent individuals hadlimited experience with anomaly research and little familiarity with therelevant literature.In addition to scientists and philosophers, many of CSICOP’s most active memberswere nonscientists. These members included the magician James Randi, who hadmade a career out of attempting to debunk metalbender Uri Geller; Phillip Klass,aviation journalist and critic of UFOlogy; and, of course, Martin Gardner,columnist, author, and true godfather of the movement. These and otherlaypersons would write articles frequently in CSICOP’s publications and help setthe tone of the organization.Over the next year, it became clear that Kurtz’s plans for CSICOP were somewhatdifferent from the professed goals of the organization. The committee came to bedominated by antiparanormal hardliners who considered Truzzi, editor of CSICOP’sofficial publication The Zetetic, too soft on CSICOP’s intended targets. Truzzi,who had become increasingly uncomfortable with the crusading, inquisitionalapproach of the committee, resigned as cochairman of the organization. Severalother noted academics resigned shortly afterward for similar reasons. AfterTruzzi’s departure, the name of CSICOP’s official publication was changed toSkeptical Inquirer, and Kurtz appointed Kendrick Frazier as editor.THE SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION OF CSICOPIn spite of its name, CSICOP has engaged in only one case of scientificinvestigation. It concerned a neoastrological claim of French psychologistsMichel and Françoise Gauquelin. Much of the Gauquelins’ work has been aimed atdebunking traditional astrology, but they have also gathered some of the mostcompelling scientific evidence in support of certain quasi-astrological ideas,namely, that the position of the planets at time of birth correlates withcertain human characteristics. One of the Gauquelins’ strongest claims has beenfor the so-called Mars Effect: although critical of traditional astrology, theGauquelins had published statistical studies that seemed to show thatsignificantly more world-class athletes were born when Mars was rising ortransiting.The Gauquelins’ results showed that 22 percent of European sports champions wereborn with Mars rising or transiting. Since the Gauquelins divided the sky intotwelve sectors, according to pure chance the probability of Mars being in anytwo sectors at one’s time of birth is 2/12 or 17 percent, well below the 22percent reported. With a sample size of 2,088 sports champions, the odds aremillions-to-one against these results occurring by chance.The controversy started with an article by Lawrence Jerome that Kurtz hadpublished in The Humanist along with his “Objections to Astrology.” In hisarticle, Jerome attacked the Mars Effect. When the Gauquelins responded andturned out to be a more skilled statistician than his critic, and also intimatedpossible legal action, Kurtz reportedly became frantic to attack the Mars Effectin print.Shortly before the formation of CSICOP, Kurtz began mailing articles relating tothe Gauquelins’ claims to several of his fellow CSICOP members, including thestatistician Marvin Zelen and astronomers George Abell and Dennis Rawlins. Inresponse, Rawlins wrote a paper that first cautioned that if the European samplewas unreliable, then no conclusions could be based upon it. He then wondered ifthere was a natural explanation, and proposed one: as seen from Earth, Marsappears near the sun more often than not. Since birth rates are higher at dawn,one would expect all births (not just those of sports champions) to be slightlyhigher with Mars rising (Sector 1) or transiting (Sector 4).However, Rawlins’ paper was not published in the January–February 1976 issue ofThe Humanist; instead, Kurtz published two other papers, one by Abell onastrology in general, and another by Zelen, “A Challenge” to the Gauquelins.Zelen’s challenge was a proposal for a classic control experiment: isolate thesports ability variable by comparing the position of Mars at the time theGauquelins’ champions were born with the position in the sky at the time ofbirth of all other persons (nonsports champions, that is), the control group,defined as individuals born about the same time and place as the champions. Ifthe 22 percent of the control group were also born when Mars was rising ortransiting, then the Mars Effect would be shown to be due to entirely naturalcauses. This, of course, is the result Kurtz, Abell, and Zelen expected. If,however, only 17 percent of the control group’s births occurred with Mars inthese positions, then the results would be in the Gauquelins’ favor. As Zelenwrote, “If the sports figures’ hours of birth fall into either of these sectorsin greater proportion than do those on nonsports figures, we must accept theGauquelins’ conclusions.” The challenge concluded with the words “We now have anobjective way for unambiguous corroboration or disconfirmation”6[32_endnote-title.html#c2e6] (emphasis added). Similarly, the astronomer Abelldescribed it as a “very definitive test.”7 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e7]The Gauquelins agreed to the terms of the test, and they began to collect dataon a large European sample of nonchampions who were born about the same time andplace as a smaller group of champions (chosen from their original sample). Whenready, the data on the nonchampions and the subset of champions was delivered toCommittee members. The stage was now set for a decisive first encounter betweenCSICOP and the “astrological charlatans.”The results of the test did not appear in print for nearly two years. Finally,however, the results were published in two papers in the November–December 1977issue of The Humanist. One paper, written by the Gauquelins, claimed that theresults of the Zelen test supported the Mars Effect. The other paper, by Zelen,Kurtz, and Abell, questioned this interpretation. Zelen and his colleagues notedthat when female athletes were dropped from the sample, the statisticalsignificance of the results was reduced. They further argued that when theremaining sample was subdivided by geographical locale, the statisticalsignificance of the results was further reduced. In order to gather enough birthrecords of nonchampions born within one week of the champions in the samegeographical locale, the Gauquelins had been forced to restrict their search tothose born in large metropolitan areas. The Committee members noted that most ofthe significant effect came from one geographical region— Paris—and so arguedthat any evidence for the Mars Effect was just a fluke: “In looking at many datasets one will occasionally conclude the existence of a real difference when infact none really exists.”8 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e8]The debate did not end there, and arguments continued back and forth. Two yearslater, in their new magazine the Skeptical Inquirer, the Committee published theresults of its own study on an American sample, which seemed to disprove theMars Effect. The Gauquelins vigorously disputed the methodology used to gatherthe sample, arguing that it excluded “the very greatest” champions, and sodiluted the effect. In response, they conducted their own study and reportedpositive results, which the Committee in turn refused to accept.FATE INTERVENESShortly after the Skeptical Inquirer article concerning the American athletes,there was a change in the membership of CSICOP’s ruling Executive Council. OnDecember 15, 1979, Dennis Rawlins, astronomer, founding member of CSICOP, anddebunking hard-liner, was ejected from the Council and replaced by Abell. Thevote for expulsion was unanimous. The following October, Rawlins was alsoremoved from the list of Fellows. The significance of these events would notbecome known until a year later, when an extraordinary article appeared in theOctober 1981 issue of Fate magazine.The article, titled “Starbaby,” was Rawlins’s inside account of CSICOP’sinvestigation into the Mars Effect. Rawlins—the only planetary motions expertinvolved with the project—wrote that the CSICOP test on European athletes andnonchampions had been botched from the beginning. According to Rawlins, Kurtz,Zelen, and Abell had repeatedly ignored his warnings. Then, when results came insupporting the existence of a Mars Effect, the three CSICOP officials coveredthem up and so distorted them that it appeared that their results did notsupport the Mars Effect. Rawlins attributed the long delay between Zelen’sChallenge and the publication of results to a frantic search by Kurtz for a wayout of having to admit that the test results seemed to confirm an astrologicalclaim.When Rawlins alerted other CSICOP notables, including Gardner, Frazier, Randi,and Klass, he was shocked to learn that they were more interested in keeping himquiet than in facing up to the truth. When Rawlins refused to drop the issue, hewas expelled from the organization. In the opening paragraph of “Starbaby” hewrote, “I am still skeptical of the occult beliefs CSICOP was created to debunk.But I have changed my mind about the integrity of some of those who make acareer of opposing occultism.”9 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e9]Rawlins pointed out that the original purpose of the Zelen Challenge had been toexamine the position of Mars in the sky at the time of birth of a group ofnonsports champions born in about the same time and place as a subsample ofGauquelin’s sports champions. Since Gauquelin had found that about 22 percent ofthe champions were born when Mars was in Sectors 1 and 4 (rising andtransiting), and since pure chance would indicate that only 17 percent of birthsshould occur at these times, the purpose of the test was to see if 22 percent ofthe nonchampions were also born with Mars in Sectors 1 and 4. If so, then theposition of Mars at time of birth would seem to have nothing to do with theability to become a sports champion, and Gauquelin’s claim for the Mars Effectwould be refuted.Rawlins had earlier warned Kurtz that, as far he could tell, Gauquelin hadperformed his statistical analysis correctly, and so the whole analysis reliedon the validity of Gauquelin’s sampling method. Rawlins had repeatedly warnedKurtz, Zelen, and Abell that they were gambling CSICOP’s reputation on thevalidity of the sample, but his warnings were ignored until results came insupporting Gauquelin’s claims. Finally something had to be published. This isRawlins’s account of the November– December Humanist Control Test report, “IsThere a Mars Effect?”:In the report KZA [Kurtz, Zelen, Abell] tried to obscure the clear successGauquelin had scored. The Control Test had entailed analyzing 16,756nonchampions born near (in time and space) 303 champions (a subsample of theoriginal 2,088 champions). KZA had believed that they too would score at 22percent in key sectors (1 and 4) thus establishing that the champions’ 22percent hit rate was “natural.”Instead, the nonchampions scored at exactly the chance-level (17 percent) thatGauquelin had predicted. . . . Faced with this disaster KZA pulled abait-and-switch. (Thus the report will be hereafter called the BS report.)Suddenly converting their nonchampions test into a champions test, they attackedthe subsample of 303 champions!10 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e10]As mentioned earlier, Kurtz, Zelen, and Abell used various techniques to reducethe significance of the results from the sample of 303 champions, such asexcluding female athletes and then subdividing the subsample of 303 (from theoriginal 2,088) by geographical locale, then arguing that the difference betweenthe champions and the nonchampions was only significant for Paris. As will bediscussed later, the smaller the sample the weaker its ability to prove anythingstatistically. But as Rawlins pointed out, all of this was completely beside thepoint. The whole purpose of the challenge was to see if the nonchampions scoredat the chance level of 17 percent, as Gauquelin had predicted. The subsample ofchampions was only used as a means of selecting the sample of nonchampions.Since the nonchampions’ rate came out to be 17 percent, Rawlins was disgustedthat Kurtz, Zelen, and Abell would not admit that the initial results had comeout in Gauquelin’s favor, but instead distorted the findings: “This is‘scientific investigation’ which CSICOP claims as its middle name?”a[38_notes.html#two1]An independent investigation by Patrick Curry backed up Rawlins’s charge thatCSICOP had mishandled the investigation.b [38_notes.html#two2] A similarconclusion was reached by psychologist and CSICOP fellow Richard Kammann, whowas one of several members to resign in the wake of Rawlins’s statements.11[32_endnote-title.html#c2e11],c [38_notes.html#two3] Eventually, CSICOPacknowledged that mistakes had been made, although it did not directly addressRawlins’s more serious charges that a Watergate-style cover-up had occurred. Oneimmediate consequence of the Mars Effect scandal was the announcement that theCommittee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal would nolonger conduct any more “scientific investigation,” and this remains theofficial policy to this day.12 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e12]d[38_notes.html#two4]So today most of the opposition faced by parapsychologists and other proponentsof unusual claims comes from an organization that refuses to conduct anyscientific research itself and merely criticizes the work of others from thesidelines. The policy of no research has reduced the organization’svulnerability to criticism, for as George Hansen remarked, “If CSICOP hadcontinued to undertake its own research, scientists might again point out errorsin its procedures and ambiguities in its interpretations. That could threatenCSICOP’s image of authority.”13 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e13] In their review ofthe Mars Effect controversy, sociologists of science T. J. Pinch and H. M.Collins concluded:As regards the Committee itself, and similar scientific-vigilante organizations,there are lessons to be learned. The Committee’s main platform for attack uponparapsychology and astrology has been the standard, or canonical, model ofscience. This is a strategy that can only be used in complete safety byorganizations that do not engage in controversial science themselves. . . . TheCommittee’s new position is that it will continue to fight the battle from theplatform of the canonical version of science—preserving the ideology as it doesso—while sensibly keeping its own hands clean and avoiding the risks of doingany experimental science itself.14 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e14]As for Rawlins, his experience did not change his skeptical views, but he didcome to the conclusion that the leading members of CSICOP who tried to keep himquiet—including Kurtz, Randi, Gardner, Frazier, Klass, and others—were moreconcerned about publicity than in conducting open-ended scientific research.Shortly before he published his exposé in Fate, Rawlins and James Randi had acouple of telephone conversations during which Randi suggested that CSICOPdistance itself from the Gauquelin matter and not wash its dirty linen inpublic. Rawlins was “quite disgusted” when he hung up.I had asked Randi the big question, the question all CSICOPs will be askingthemselves for years to come: Why? Why get involved in a conspiracy that was asstupid as it was low? Why do something that would mark him and CSICOP for therest of their lives? The reply was ever the same: We can’t let the mysticsrejoice. A lifetime price—just to prevent a little transient cuckoo chirping.15[32_endnote-title.html#c2e15]In due course the Starbaby scandal faded from the memories of all but those whowere paying close attention, and through its magazine Skeptical Inquirer CSICOPwent on to address a growing audience. Backed by an aggressive marketingcampaign, the magazine achieved wide circulation, claiming a paid worldwidecirculation of over 50,000 by the end of 2002,e [38_notes.html#two5] althoughcirculation seems to have peaked in recent years.Since the departure of the more moderate members, little dissent or criticism ofthe Committee has been seen in the pages of Skeptical Inquirer. Engineer GeorgeHansen has closely monitored the activities of CSICOP over the years, and notes:The magazine nearly always presents only one side of a controversy in itsarticles. Although “SI” sometimes published letters of complaint, full papersfrom CSICOP’s critics almost never appear. This is in remarkable contrast torefereed parapsychology journals, and even some of the pro-paranormal magazines.For instance, the popularly written magazine Fate has carried full articles byCSICOP members Susan Blackmore, L. Sprague de Camp, Kendrick Frazier, MartinGardner, Philip Klass, Larry Kusche, Lawrence Jerome, David Marks, Joe Nickell,James Oberg, Dennis Rawlins, Robert Sheaffer, Gordon Stein, and Marcello Truzzi.In keeping with CSICOP’S one-sided approach, “SI” has given scant attention topapers in well-known, orthodox scientific journals that present evidence forpsi.16 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e16]The writers whose work appears in Skeptical Inquirer also largely ignore thespecialized scientific journals that deal exclusively with psi research, such asthe Journal of Parapsychology and the Journal of the American Society forPsychical Research. The existence of these journals is rarely acknowledged inthe magazine, and when they are mentioned it is usually only in passing, despitethe fact that the former journal has been published for more than sixty yearsand the latter for more than ninety. In fact, the Committee has even claimedthat “the Skeptical Inquirer is the only major periodical in the world thatexamines paranormal and occult claims from a scientific viewpoint.”17[32_endnote-title.html#c2e17]Under the editorship of Kendrick Frazier, the Skeptical Inquirer has becomeCSICOP’s organ of propaganda, the means by which the Committee almost alwayspresents only one side of controversies. Although Frazier has written that “theCommittee founded a quarterly journal, the Skeptical Inquirer, to disseminateaccurate information about the results of . . . inquiries to the scientificcommunity and the public,”18 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e18] the real purpose ofthe magazine is hardly the impartial, objective evaluation of anomalous claims.Henry Bauer has written that a publication such as Skeptical Inquirer “servesonly the purpose of speaking to the already converted: These writings are betterunderstood as rituals of self-motivation and selfassurance than as attempts tomake a case that might persuade opponents or the general public, let alone asattempts to clarify the substantive issue.”19 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e19] ButBauer’s penetrating analysis implies that the magazine’s purpose is alsopropaganda, a systematic attempt to persuade the uncommitted that the study ofthese anomalous phenomena has nothing to offer science.f [38_notes.html#two6]Even some skeptics have expressed dismay over the nature of the writing inSkeptical Inquirer. For instance, skeptical psychologist Elizabeth Mayerdescribes how she began investigating psi phenomena:I had high hopes for what CSICOP’s journal might provide. At the very least itwould, I thought, offer useful balance to journals with a clear bent towardbelief in the paranormal. I was particularly enthused about the SkepticalInquirer’s policy of reviewing research on anomalous mental capacities publishedelsewhere. I figured that CSICOP would help me come up with useful challenges toarticles written from the more credulous side.But it didn’t work that way. Reading the Skeptical Inquirer was like reading afundamentalist religious tract. I found the journal dismayingly snide, regularlypunctuated by sarcasm, self-congratulation, and nastiness, all parading asreverence for true science.20 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e20]g[38_notes.html#two7]NATURE OF CSICOP MEMBERSHIPThe major features of CSICOP’s membership that affect its goals and spheres ofinfluence would seem to be the high educational level of its membership, thedisproportionate number of magicians among its members, and the influence ofreligious convictions. A substantial portion of the members share similar viewson religion and are active in promoting them.Educational LevelThe academic status of many of the Committee’s members gives the organizationits legitimacy in the eyes of important segments of society. CSICOP has soughtsupport (and thus prestige) by actively recruiting people such as MurrayGell-Mann (Nobel laureate in physics), Francis Crick (Nobel laureate forphysiology), and (now-deceased) members Carl Sagan, Stephan Jay Gould, and B. F.Skinner. When such prestigious people lend their names to an antiparanormalcrusade, readers may assume that such individuals are experts on anomaliesresearch and that scientists speak with one voice on the matters CSICOP“investigates.”According to George Hansen:The prominence of the membership gives the Committee a number of benefits. Itallows CSICOP’s voice to be heard in academic debates on the paranormal. TheNational Research Council report on parapsychology is an example. Nonmemberacademics are likely to consider CSICOP’s views when refereeing papers,evaluating grant proposals, and counseling students. CSICOP’s views are likelyto be influential when it comes to deciding how, and to what extent, theparanormal will be scientifically investigated within academia.21[32_endnote-title.html#c2e21]MagiciansThe proportion of magicians in CSI is much higher than in the generalpopulation, and the number of prominent magicians who are or have been membersof CSI/CSICOP includes Henry Gordon, Milbourne Christopher, Robert Steiner, andPersi Diaconis. Martin Gardner has contributed to magic magazines, Randi hasbeen a professional magician since the age of eighteen, and Ray Hyman, althoughprimarily a psychologist, has been featured on the cover of “Linking Ring,” oneof the most popular magic magazines in the world. All three have served on theExecutive Council of the Committee. Even cofounder Marcello Truzzi (who, asmentioned above, has long since resigned) has served as vice president of thePsychic Entertainers Association.The large and important role conjurors have played within CSICOP may give onethe impression that most professional magicians are skeptical about theexistence of psi. Surprisingly, various polls have shown that conjurors seem tobelieve in the reality of psi in even greater numbers than members of thegeneral public. Polly Birdsell polled a group of magicians in California andfound that 82 percent of her sample expressed a belief in ESP;22[32_endnote-title.html#c2e22] Muller polled conjurors in Germany and found that72 percent thought psi was probably real;23 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e23] Truzzipolled members of the Psychic Entertainers Association and discovered that 87percent thought that ESP “truly exists” and 25 percent believed that “sciencehas demonstrated the existence of extrasensory perception.”24[32_endnote-title.html#c2e24] And many prominent magicians, such as HowardThurston and Joseph Dunninger, have endorsed reports of psychic phenomena.25[32_endnote-title.html#c2e25] As Hansen concludes, “It is simply a myth thatmagicians have been predominantly skeptical about the existence of psi.”26[32_endnote-title.html#c2e26]Religious ViewsMany members of CSICOP hold religious views that are antagonistic toward theparanormal. The influence of religion on the antiparanormal views of theCommittee cannot be overstated, and it is apparent in the writing of many of itsleading spokespersons, such as Paul Kurtz, James Alcock, and Martin Gardner, allof whom are, or have been, members of the Executive Council.CSICOP chairman and founder Paul Kurtz has been active in promoting atheism,both in his former role as editor of The Humanist and in his current role aspresident of Prometheus Books, which has published such titles as The AtheistDebater’s Handbook and Atheism: The Case Against God. Prometheus has alsopublished books written by Kurtz himself, such as The Transcendental Temptation:A Critique of Religion and the Paranormal, the title of which speaks foritself.h [38_notes.html#two8]James Alcock has made several attempts to associate parapsychology with religionin order to discredit its status as a branch of science, even at one pointreferring to parapsychology as “the spiritual science.”27[32_endnote-title.html#c2e27] Elsewhere, in a book titled Parapsychology:Science or Magic? Alcock writes:In the name of religion human beings have committed genocide, toppled thrones,built gargantuan shrines, practiced ritual murder, forced others to conform totheir way of life, eschewed the pleasures of the flesh, flagellated themselves,or given away all their possessions and become martyrs. . . . An examination ofthe origins and functions of religion . . . is a useful starting point for thestudy of modern parapsychology.28 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e28]But not all CSICOP members have antireligious views. One can only guess whatKurtz and Alcock think of the opinions of fellow member Martin Gardner, whofrankly acknowledged the influence his religious beliefs have had on hisopposition to parapsychology when he wrote:It is possible that paranormal forces not yet established may allow prayers toinfluence the material world, and I certainly am not saying that thispossibility should be ruled out. . . . As for empirical tests of the power ofGod to answer prayer, I am among those theists who, in the spirit of Jesus’remark that only the faithless look for signs, consider such tests both futileand blasphemous . . . let us not tempt God.29 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e29]However, his theistic beliefs appear to make Gardner a rare exception amongCommittee members. As mentioned, the roots of CSICOP are in the AmericanHumanist Association, and several leading members have publicly identifiedthemselves as holding atheistic or nontheistic views, including George Abell,Francis Crick, Paul Edwards, Antony Flew, Stephen Jay Gould, James Randi, GordonStein, and many others.30 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e30]To Kurtz and several other prominent Committee members, belief in the paranormalis based, in part, upon the same foundations as religious belief, and becausereligion is delusionary and harmful, paranormal beliefs are also a danger tosociety. There can be no doubt that some of the psychological needs that promotebelief in religion (such as the desire to influence nature and for life afterdeath) are at least partially responsible for the widespread interest inparapsychology. Modern science has discredited naïve and literal interpretationsof many religions, so some people have looked to parapsychology for empiricalevidence of a mental and perhaps spiritual realm over and above the materialworld. Indeed, a desire to challenge what they regarded as the depressingmechanistic worldview proposed by nineteenth-century science, combined with anintense curiosity about the evidence for life after death, formed an explicitand openly acknowledged part of the motivation of many of those who founded theSociety for Psychical Research in 1882.The revolutionary new science that began in the seventeenth century, with itsmechanistic assumptions, gave intellectuals the tools to effectively challengethe authority of church and scripture, and to replace it with an appeal to humanreason and secular values. During the period that became known as theEnlightenment, the horrors of the Inquisition and the religious wars were stillfresh in people’s minds. The new worldview, spread by people such as Diderot andVoltaire, can be seen partly as a reaction to the ecclesiastical domination overthought that the church held for centuries. In the mechanistic, materialisticworldview given birth by seventeenth-century science, there was little if anyroom for the intervention of a deity, the action of an immaterial mind, and, bycorollary, for telepathy, second sight, and other “supernatural” phenomena thatwere now dismissed as vulgar superstition. And it is this worldview that isdefended by modern secular humanists, which they rightly see as threatened bythe claims of parapsychology. For many humanists, the widespread acceptance ofthese claims would be the first step in a return to religious fanaticism,superstition, and irrationality.i [38_notes.html#two9]However, although CSICOP was ostensibly formed to defend society from“antiscientific and pseudoscientific irrationalism,” there seems to be little ifany evidence that the scientific adventure is threatened by unorthodox claims.Belief in the reality of psi phenomena is widespread among the general public,but polls have also shown that over 90 percent of the public regard scientistsas having “considerable” or even “very great” prestige.31[32_endnote-title.html#c2e31] Furthermore, as we will see later, polls haveshown that a majority of mainstream scientists consider ESP to be at least “alikely possibility,” and many leading scientists have lent their support toparapsychological research. As Jerome Clark has written, “Some observers viewCSICOP’s claims about ‘anti-science’ components of paranormal interest not onlyas a rhetorical strategy, but also as an equation (explicitly stated in theliterature) of the Humanist vision with the scientific vision.”32[32_endnote-title.html#c2e32]Most modern parapsychologists consider themselves committed to a scientificexamination of so-called paranormal phenomena; furthermore, many believe thereis persuasive scientific evidence for the existence of these phenomena, and theydo not consider this belief a danger to society or to science. This book willconsider whether or not there is convincing scientific evidence for theexistence of these phenomena; whether or not the existence of these phenomenawould be in conflict with modern science; and whether or not parapsychology is ascience.CONCLUSIONSParapsychology is the only scientific discipline for which there is anorganization of skeptics trying to discredit its work. It should be noted thatin 2006 CSICOP shortened its name to the Committee for Scientific Inquiry, withthe new acronym CSI. As this organization no longer performs any research of itsown, the true nature of CSI is clearly that of a scientific vigilanteorganization defending a narrow brand of scientific fundamentalism, whose majorgoal has been to influence the media and, through it, public opinion. Manywriters have pointed out that true skepticism involves the practice of doubt,not of simple denial, and so, according to this criterion, CSI does not trulyqualify as an organization of skeptics. As CSI’s major moderate figure, RayHyman, has observed, “Many well-intentioned critics have jumped into the fraywithout carefully thinking through the various implications of their statements.They have sometimes displayed more emotion than logic, made sweeping chargesbeyond what they reasonably support, failed to adequately document theirassertions, and, in general, have failed to do the homework necessary to maketheir challenges credible.”33 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e33]Surveys have shown that over half of the adult population claims to have hadpsychic experiences and believes in the reality of the phenomena: for instance,the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center surveyed 1,473adults, of which 67 percent claimed that they had experienced ESP.34[32_endnote-title.html#c2e34] When these individuals encounter the debunking anddismissive attitudes of those claiming to be “scientific authorities,” many arelikely to conclude that scientists are dogmatic and closed-minded. Ironically,one of the major effects of CSI’s relentless campaign may be an increasedrejection of science by the public, as many individuals conclude that scienceitself is a dogma, with little relevance for important aspects of their lives.As we will see in chapter 15 [27_chapter-title-15.html], twentieth-centurymodels of science show that science has a marvelously self-correcting mechanismbuilt into it, and so there is no need for self-appointed vigilantes to guardthe gates. The debate over the reality of psi will be ultimately settled not atpress conferences but by the quality of the data gathered by those who conductserious research. Indeed, the quality of the data has resulted in changing viewsamong the skeptics in recent years, and several prominent skeptics have beenforced to make some notable concessions, which, for the most part, they are noteager to advertise.But one prominent member of CSICOP, the late Carl Sagan, who on severaloccasions urged his fellow Committee members to resist dogmatic thinking and beopen to new discoveries, made a candid admission in a 1995 book, otherwiseloaded with skepticism over various New Age and “psychic” claims:At the time of writing there are three claims in the ESP field which, in myopinion, deserve serious study: (1) that by thought alone humans can (barely)affect random number generators in computers; (2) that people under mild sensorydeprivation can receive thoughts or images “projected” at them; and (3) thatyoung children sometimes report the details of a previous life, which uponchecking turn out to be accurate and which they could not have known about inany other way than reincarnation.35 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e35]Over the last ten years or so there have been signs that psi research is beingtaken much more seriously by mainstream scientific organizations.Parapsychologist Dean Radin pointed out:In the 1990s alone, seminars on psi research were part of the regular programsat the annual conferences of the American Association for the Advancement ofScience, the American Psychological Association, and the American StatisticalAssociation. Invited lectures on the status of psi research were presented fordiplomats at the United Nations, for academics at Harvard University, and forscientists at Bell Laboratories.The pentagon has not overlooked these activities. From 1981 to 1995, fivedifferent U.S. government–sponsored scientific review committees were given thetask of examining the evidence for psi effects. The reviews were prompted byconcerns that if psi was genuine, it might be important for national securityreasons. . . . [A]ll five reviews concluded that the experimental evidence forcertain forms of psychic phenomena merited serious scientific study.36[32_endnote-title.html#c2e36]The metaphor invoked at the beginning of this section was that of war, but abetter comparison may be that of revolution. Radical new ideas in fields asdiverse as physics and cognitive science have transformed our understanding ofnature, and, as a result, a new scientific worldview is emerging, one that isconsistent with the reality of psi. Parapsychologists have developed new andmore rigorous experimental techniques, physicists and psychologists havedeveloped testable theories about how psi may work, and the skeptics have beenforced to make some notable concessions. As always, the defenders of the oldorder are not giving up without a fight. But as will be seen in the pages thatfollow, the old regime may be on the verge of collapse.Many of the ideas presented in the pages that follow may seem strange, and manyof them are strange. But I can do no better at this point than to quote the latebiologist J. B. Haldane: “The fact about science is that everyone who has made aserious contribution to it is aware, or very strongly suspects, that the worldis not only queerer than anyone has imagined, but queerer than anyone canimagine.”37 [32_endnote-title.html#c2e37]"},{"pageContent":"THREEThe Historical EvidenceIt has always seemed to me most strange and most deplorable that the vastmajority of philosophers and psychologists should utterly ignore the strongprima facie case that exists for the occurrence of many supernormal phenomenawhich, if genuine, must profoundly affect our theories of the human mind, itscognitive powers, and its relation to the human body.C. D. BROADOne needs to remember that skepticism is not necessarily a badge oftoughmindedness: it may equally be a sign of intellectual cowardice.JOHN BELOFFHerodotus tells us that back in 550 BC, Croesus, king of Lydia, was becomingincreasingly alarmed by the growing strength of the Persian Empire. He thusconsidered launching a preemptive strike against his enemies. Croesus wantedadvice, but he was unsure about which of the halfdozen oracles doing business inand around Greece he should consult. So he devised a test. He sent a message toeach of the oracles, asking for a written description of the king’s activitiesat a specified day and time.The answers given to the messengers were to be taken down in writing and broughtback to Lydia. None of the replies remain on record except that from the Oracleat Delphi. Herodotus tells us that the moment the Lydians entered the sanctuary,the Pythoness answered them in hexameter verse:I can count the sands, and I can measure the ocean;I have ears for the silent, and know what the dumb man means;Lo! On my sense there strikes the smell of a shell-covered tortoise,Boiling now on a fire, with the flesh of a lamb, in a cauldron—Brass is the vessel below, and brass the cover above it.On that day Croesus had cut a lamb and a tortoise into pieces and boiled theflesh in a brass cauldron. Impressed only with this answer, Croesus consultedthe Oracle at Delphi a second time. Should he attack the Persians? The Pythonessanswered that if Croesus attacked the Persians, he would destroy a mightyempire. So Croesus attacked, and lost both the war and his empire. Herodotusthus described the world’s first recorded psi experiment.Another ancient story concerns the Greek traveler and philosopher Apollonius ofTyana. While in Ephesus he suddenly began to describe an attack on the cruelRoman emperor Domitian in Rome, to the astonishment of bystanders. Later, theywere still more astonished to learn that Domitian had, in fact, beenassassinated at the time of the vision.1 [32_endnote-title.html#c3e1]The famous scientist and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, while at a reception inGothenburg in 1759, suddenly went into a trance and described in detail adisastrous fire that was sweeping Stockholm three hundred miles away. Hedescribed where and when it had started, where it was burning, and was relievedwhen he informed the company that its progress had been halted not far from hisown house. When a courier later arrived from Stockholm, it was found that thecourse of the fire exactly matched Swedenborg’s description. The reception wasattended by several local nobles who testified to the accuracy of Swedenborg’svision.2 [32_endnote-title.html#c3e2]REPORTS FROM TRIBAL SOCIETIESThe Zulus were studied by Bishop Henry Callaway, and his results were publishedin his 1869 book The Religious System of the Amazulu. Callaway’s work is ofspecial interest because he had studied the tribes before contact with Europeancivilization had made much impression on them. In his book, he described how theZulus assumed that anyone could practice a form of distant vision:When anything valuable is lost, they look for it at once; when they cannot findit, each one begins to practice this inner divination, trying to feel where thething is; for, not being able to see it, he feels internally a pointing whichtells him, if he will go down to such a place, it is there, and he will find it.At length he sees it, and himself approaching it; before he begins to move fromwhere he is he sees it very clearly indeed, and there is an end of doubt. Thesight is so clear that it is as though it were not an inner sight, but as if hesaw the very thing itself and the place where it is.3[32_endnote-title.html#c3e3]The Zulus had a poetic name for this faculty: “Opening the gates of distance.”Many similar reports have come from Africa. In The Sixth Sense, Joseph Sineltold of his son, who lived among the tribespeople of the southern Sudan, and howhe had found that “telepathy is constant.” They always seemed to know where hewas and what he was doing, even when he was far away. Once, when he was lost, agroup of them came out to find him, as if they had sensed his plight. LaurensVan Der Post found that villagers in the Kalahari could tell in advance which ofthe bush pilots would be flying in to use their landing strip—“Red Nose,”“Shining Face,” or “Hippo-belly”—although they had no radio communication. Thehistorian Brian Inglis wrote:When a Kalahari bushman killed an eland—regarded as a notable achievement—thecamp immediately knew of it “by wire,” as one bushman described it, evidentlyunder the impression that the white man’s telegraph also worked by telepathy.Before they reached the camp with the eland, Van Der Post would hear the soundsof the song which was used to celebrate on such occasions.4[32_endnote-title.html#c3e4]On the other side of the world, it seems that telepathic communication was verymuch a part of the Australian aborigine way of life. In 1914 DavidUnaipon—described in the Melbourne journal that covered the story as “aChristianised and highly-educated brainy Australian native”—delivered a lecturein which he told how the aborigines used smoke signals not, as travelers hadreported, as a kind of code but to attract attention, so that communicationcould then be made by telepathy.He might want to give his brother, who might be twenty miles away, a message; sohe would set to and make a smoke signal, and then sit down and concentrate hismind on his brother. The column of smoke would be seen by all the blacks formiles around, and they would all concentrate their minds, and put their brainsinto a state of receptivity. Only his brother, however, would get into touchwith him, and he could then suggest to his brother the message which he wishedto convey.5 [32_endnote-title.html#c3e5]SEEING THE FUTUREIn all parts of the world, in all eras, it has been assumed that certainindividuals could glimpse the future. This has been one of the main functions ofthe tribal shaman. Unfortunately, most of the early explorers took littleinterest in testing the shamans they encountered, and at any rate, thosemissionaries who accepted the shaman’s powers as genuine almost invariablyconsidered them diabolical.However, the French missionary Friar P. Boilat published the results of hisinvestigation into the psychic powers of African witch doctors in his 1853Esquisses Senegalaises (Sketches Senegalese). Boilat described how, hoping toprove that a witch doctor’s powers were not genuine, put to him an unspokenquestion. The witch doctor not only guessed the question correctly but also gaveBoilat the accurate prediction that the documents he was waiting for wouldarrive in fifteen days.6 [32_endnote-title.html#c3e6]Dreaming of the FutureIn 1865 Abraham Lincoln told his wife and his friend, Ward Lamon, of a ratherdisturbing dream:About ten days ago, I retired very late. I had been up waiting for importantdispatches from the front. I could not have been long in bed when I fell into aslumber, for I was weary. I soon began to dream. There seemed to be a death-likestillness about me. Then I heard subdued sobs, as if a number of people wereweeping. I thought I left my bed and wandered downstairs. There the silence wasbroken by the same pitiful sobbing, but the mourners were invisible. I went fromroom to room; no living person was in sight, but the same mournful sounds ofdistress met me as I passed along. I saw light in all the rooms; every objectwas familiar to me; but where were all the people who were grieving as if theirhearts would break? I was puzzled and alarmed. What could be the meaning of allthis? Determined to find the cause of a state of things so mysterious and soshocking, I kept on until I arrived at the East Room, which I entered. There Imet with a sickening surprise. Before me was a catafalque, on which rested acorpse wrapped in funeral vestments. Around it were stationed soldiers who wereacting as guards; and there was a throng of people, gazing mournfully upon thecorpse, whose face was covered, others weeping pitifully. ‘Who is dead in theWhite House?’ I demanded of one of the soldiers, ‘The President,’ was hisanswer; ‘he was killed by an assassin.’ Then came a loud burst of grief from thecrowd, which woke me from my dream. I slept no more that night; and although itwas only a dream, I have been strangely annoyed by it ever since.7[32_endnote-title.html#c3e7]Three days later the president was dead, and shortly after his body lay in statein the East Room.Less well known is the fact that General Ulysses S. Grant and his wife, Julia,were scheduled to accompany Lincoln to Ford’s theater that fateful night, to sitwith the president in his balcony box. The honor was due to Grant’s acceptance afew days earlier of the unconditional surrender of Confederate General Robert E.Lee.On the morning of the day of the assassination, Mrs. Grant felt a great sense ofurgency that she, her husband, and her child should leave Washington and returnto their home in New Jersey. The general had appointments throughout the day andcould not leave, but as Mrs. Grant’s sense of urgency increased she kept sendinghim messages begging him to leave. Her insistence was so great that he finallyagreed to leave with her, even though they were scheduled to accompany thepresident to the theater that night. When they reached Philadelphia, they notonly heard that the president had been assassinated, but that they were also onthe assassin’s list of intended victims.8 [32_endnote-title.html#c3e8]The Sinking of TitanicA startling case of precognition emerged in a work of fiction, Futility,published in 1898. It told the story of a new monster ocean liner, the largestever built, designed to be unsinkable and so, despite a capacity of threethousand passengers, carried only twenty-four lifeboats, the minimum numberrequired by regulation. It was described as being eight hundred feet long andbuilt with nineteen watertight compartments, separated by bulkheads that wouldclose automatically upon impact.However, a starboard impact with an iceberg near midnight on her Atlanticcrossing sank the liner, with heavy loss of life. Fourteen years later Titanic,882 feet long, with sixteen watertight compartments, and despite a capacity ofthree thousand passengers equipped with only twenty lifeboats, collided with aniceberg on her starboard side at 11:40 p.m. and sank shortly afterward withheavy loss of life. What made the resemblance between the novel and the actualsinking even more uncanny was the name Morgan Robertson had given his fictionalliner: Titan.Churchill’s Close CallIn her autobiography, Lady Churchill recalled that after a tour of inspection hemade during the Blitz of London, Winston Churchill was about to get into a staffcar on the near side, as he always did, when, for no apparent reason, he stoppedand got into the other side of the car instead, something Lady Churchill hadnever known him to do before. While being driven back a bomb fell near the car,lifting it up on its two nearside wheels. Had Churchill been sitting on thatside, as usual, the car would have turned over: “Only Winston’s extra weight hadprevented disaster.” Later, when asked by his wife why he had changed his mindgetting into the car, Churchill said that something made him stop, in a way thattold him he was meant to sit on the other side. “I sometimes have a feeling—infact I have had it very strongly—a feeling of interference,” he told a gatheringof miners later in the war. “I have a feeling sometimes that some guiding handhas interfered.”9 [32_endnote-title.html#c3e9]David Booth and Flight 191On May 15, 1979, David Booth of Cincinnati woke up from a nightmare. In hisdream he had been watching a jetliner coming in for a landing, but “not makingthe sound that it should—being so close to home it should have been louder thanit was.” In describing his dream to his wife, Pam, he said the plane suddenlybanked right, turned upside down, and went down nose first.The dream was repeated every night from then on, until, on May 24, Booth calledPaul Williams of the Federal Aviation Administration at the Cincinnati airport.Booth told Williams about his dream and was described as being “verydistraught.”The next day American Airlines Flight 191 approached O’Hare Airport in Chicagoand was given permission to land. When the DC-10 was three hundred feet off theground, it suddenly banked right, turned upside down, and crashed nose first,with 273 lives lost. Paul Williams later described the precrash maneuver as“very unusual—as a matter of fact the only one I’ve heard of for a plane thatsize.” When asked if he believes Booth foresaw the crash, he replied, “All I cansay is, I don’t know,” but quickly added, “If David told me that a certain planewas going to crash, I certainly wouldn’t get on that plane.”10[32_endnote-title.html#c3e10]Is the Future Fixed?A burning question that arises from reports like these is: Are these glimpses ofwhat will happen, or only of what might happen if steps are not taken to avoidit? Louisa Rhine probed this question in great detail. She examined 433 cases inwhich the foreseen event was so unpleasant that anyone would want to prevent it.In about two-thirds of the cases, no attempt was made to prevent the event,because the person simply forgot, feared ridicule, or for some other reason. Inthe end, she was left with 191 cases in which people had attempted to prevent aforeseen event from taking place.In 31 percent of the cases, the attempted intervention was unsuccessful, mostoften because the psychic experience had not provided enough information toallow the experient to prevent the occurrence. However, in the remaining cases(69 percent) the people were able to take adequate steps to prevent the event,or at least to avoid some of the undesirable consequences. Here is an example,in Louisa Rhine’s own words:It concerns a mother who dreamed that two hours later a violent storm wouldloosen a heavy chandelier to fall directly on her baby’s head lying in a cribbelow it; in the dream she saw her baby killed dead. She awoke her husband whosaid it was a silly dream and that she should go back to sleep. . . . Theweather was so calm the dream did appear ridiculous and she could have gone backto sleep. But she did not. She went and brought the baby back to her own bed.Two hours later just at the time she specified, a storm caused the heavy lightfixture to fall right on where the baby’s head had been—but the baby was notthere to be killed by it.11 [32_endnote-title.html#c3e11]Cases such as this suggest that the individual precognizes not the actual futureevent but rather the potential event that may occur. These cases suggest thatthe future exists not deterministically but only as a range of probabilities,and that human intervention may affect which of those events of varyingprobability actually do occur.Louisa Rhine advised a pragmatic approach to what appear to be glimpses into thefuture. If it appears to be a warning, then it should be treated as such, andsteps should be taken to avoid the problem. But with the present state of ourignorance, and because of the number of cranks in our midst, she advised againstissuing public warnings. And since we know so little about the nature of theseexperiences, and because efforts to prevent disasters often fail for reasonsentirely beyond the control of the person who had the experience, she alsocounseled that there is absolutely no reason to feel any guilt over failures toprevent these mishaps.Psychic SpiesFrom 1978 to 1995 the U.S. government ran its controversial Stargate program,studying, among other things, remote viewing, which has been defined as the“ability of human participants to acquire information about spatially andtemporally remote geographical targets, otherwise inaccessible by any knownsensory means.”When Army Brigadier General James Dozier was kidnapped by the Red Brigades innorthern Italy in 1981, the remote viewers in the program were assigned the taskof locating Dozier, with the idea that any information provided would be used asan adjunct to more conventional sources. Six hours after Dozier was kidnapped,the remote viewers, including Joe McMoneagle, were given a photograph of thegeneral and his name, and asked to describe his location. Enough time hadelapsed to have moved Dozier out of Italy, so no one was sure if he was still inthe country. McMoneagle provided the name of the town where Dozier was beinghidden—Padua—and another remote viewer gave the name of the building.Meanwhile, the Italian authorities received a tip from a relative of one of thekidnappers, and Dozier was rescued by the Italian paramilitary police shortlybefore information from the remote viewers arrived. However, it was laterreported that the information provided by the remote viewers regarding Dozier’slocation was accurate, right down to the bed where he had been chained.Remote SensingThe following case was related to a prominent parapsychologist by a manager at ahigh-technology firm:In the middle of the night, out of a deep sleep, Fred suddenly jerked uprightinto a sitting position. He clutched his chest, gasping for breath. His wife,abruptly awakened by her husband’s sudden movement, anxiously asked, “What’swrong?” A few moments later, when Fred was able to breathe normally again, hetold his wife that he was all right, but he had a feeling that somethingterrible had happened. They glanced at the clock: 2:05 A.M.Fifteen minutes later, as they settled back to sleep, the phone rang. Fred’sfather was on the line. “I have bad news,” he said. “Your mother just had aheart attack. We were sleeping, when she suddenly sat bolt upright, clutched herchest, and . . . she passed away.” Fred was shocked. “When did this happen?” heasked. “About fifteen minutes ago, just after 2:00 A.M.,” replied his father.12[32_endnote-title.html#c3e12]ANIMALS AND ESPBiologist Rupert Sheldrake has collected and analyzed hundreds of cases of whatappear to be ESP in animals. Here is one reported by Stephen Hyde of Acton,London:My brother Michael was a copilot in a Wellington bomber during the war. He wenton many raids over Germany in 1940. At that time we had a dog, Milo, who washalf spaniel, half Collie, and was particularly fond of Michael. One night inJune, Michael was on his way home from a raid when he radioed to base to saythat he was just off the coast of Belgium and would soon be back. That samenight Milo, who slept in a stable at the back of the house, howled so much thatmy mother had to get up and bring him into the house. Michael never returnedfrom his mission, that night. He was reported missing, believed killed, June 10,1940.13 [32_endnote-title.html#c3e13]Of course dogs are social animals that form bonds not only with people but alsowith each other. So if there is evidence of telepathic contact between dogs andhumans, there should also be evidence of telepathy between dogs. Here is one ofseven collected by Sheldrake in which the death of one dog occurred unexpectedlyand at a distance; this one was reported by Dr. Max Rallon of Chateauneuf leRouge, France:I have a Beance Sheepdog, Yssa, two years old, who came with me to France at theage of three months from the island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean, 10,000kilometers away. There I left her mother, Zoubida, aged ten. On February 13 thisyear, Yssa was sleeping in my son’s room. About 3:00 A.M. she came scratching atmy door, whining, crying, and excited. She didn’t want to go outside. At 9:00A.M. my brother-in-law called from Reunion. The guard of our house had foundZoubida dead. She had been poisoned.14 [32_endnote-title.html#c3e14]From his studies with our animal cousins, Sheldrake has concluded that“telepathy usually occurs between animals that are bonded with each other,” andthat “in schools, flocks, herds, packs, and other social groups telepathiccommunication may play an important role in the coordination of the activity ofthe group.” Also, “At least in birds and mammals, telepathy has to do withemotions, needs, and intentions. Feelings communicated telepathically includefear, alarm, excitement, calls for help, calls to go to a particular place,anticipation of arrivals or departures, and distress and dying.”15[32_endnote-title.html#c3e15]He has also concluded that most of the psi abilities he has discussed in hiswork “are better developed in animals than in people. Normally, dogs seem to bethe most sensitive, followed by cats, horses, and parrots, with humans trailingfar behind.”16 [32_endnote-title.html#c3e16]ANECDOTAL VERSUS E XPERIMENTAL EVIDENCEThe cases discussed above are only a tiny sample of the total reported in theliterature, but the skeptics dismiss all such reports as “anecdotal”—that is,based on spontaneous experience and not controlled observation. Anecdotalevidence is of course still evidence, but often it can only be considered merelysuggestive, not conclusive. This is especially so when we are dealing with acomplex phenomenon involving many variables. So, for instance, if a number offormerly depressed patients tell their physicians that they feel better aftertaking some herbal supplement, most of the physicians will not simply accept thereports at face value. After all, the positive effects in a patient may be dueto any number of factors—a healthier diet, more exercise, nicer weather, theplacebo effect, or any combination of such factors. With the accumulation ofenough anecdotal reports, double-blind experiments might be performed, with thepurpose of controlling as many causal variables as possible in order todetermine if there really is an effect, and, if so, of what magnitude.Most of us may have no problem with accepting anecdotal reports on somesubjects, such as, say, the amusing behavior of house cats, because most of ushave seen domestic cats in action. But psi phenomena are comparatively rare, andfor this and other reasons their existence is highly controversial. So theconventional theorists have attempted to explain away the anecdotal reports asbeing due to coincidence, misperception, faulty memory, embellishment,hallucination, fraud, and so forth. The skeptics have demanded—quitereasonably—experimental evidence for the existence of psi. Has reliableexperimental evidence been provided?"},{"pageContent":"QUESTION 1Is There Conclusive Experimental Evidence for Psi?Psychic phenomena have failed to be verified after 150 years of attemptsinvolving thousands of independent experiments.

The statistical results of thestudies examined are far beyond what is expected by chance.JESSICA UTTS, AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE FOR PSYCHIC FUNCTIONING, 1995"},{"pageContent":"FOURThe Early YearsThe year 1882 marks a milestone in psi research: in February of that year theSociety for Psychical Research (SPR) was founded in London. The early membershipincluded many distinguished scholars and scientists of the late Victorian era,including the Cambridge philosopher Henry Sidgwick, distinguished physicistsWilliam Barrett and William Crookes, and Nobel laureates Lord Rayleigh and J. J.Thomson, the latter being the discoverer of the electron. Other prominentmembers included scholars Frederic Myers, Edmund Gurney, and Richard Hodgson,and the Balfour family. Arthur Balfour was a philosopher, politician, and, from1902 to 1905, prime minister of England. His younger brother, Gerald, was aclassical scholar and politician, while his sister, Eleanor Balfour, was a womanof outstanding intellectual ability and a pioneer of women’s education. Allthree Balfours would in turn serve as presidents of the Society. In 1885 thedistinguished philosopher-psychologist William James helped found the AmericanSociety for Psychical Research in New York, and both organizations exist to thisday.The main work of the SPR during the early years was carried out by officersappointed by its Council, in particular by Myers, Gurney, Hodgson, and EleanorBalfour. Much of the early work involved investigation of spontaneous cases, andof hauntings and apparitions. But there was also experimental work, primarilyinvolving the reproduction of drawings at a distance, and it was Myers whocoined the term telepathy—Greek for “distant feeling.” However, the work of theSociety drew criticism from many scientists of the time, as it was seen asincompatible with the materialist doctrine that was then becoming prevalent. Aparticularly dogmatic response to the Society’s work came from physiologistHermann von Helmholtz, who remarked that “neither the testimony of all theFellows of the Royal Society, nor even the evidence of my own senses, would leadme to believe in the transmission of thought from one person to anotherindependently of the recognized channels of sense. It is clearly impossible.”1[32_endnote-title.html#c4e1]a [38_notes.html#four1]But the work continued at a vigorous pace, and soon the SPR was publishing ascholarly journal. The SPR was also notoriously tough in its investigations, andit exposed several fraudulent mediums. As mentioned, most of the early workfocused on case studies, but a few of the early researchers were alreadyconducting experiments involving card guessing and the remote viewing ofdrawings. Nobel Laureate Charles Richet is generally credited with being thefirst to recognize that probability theory could be applied to card-guessingexperiments, and in 1884 he published a paper on the application of statisticsto experiments testing clairvoyance. However, despite Richet’s innovations, thestatistical apparatus necessary to properly evaluate psi experiments was notfully in place until the 1920s, due to the work of R. A. Fisher and otherpioneer statisticians. By this time, J. B. Rhine was setting up the firstuniversity laboratory to be devoted exclusively to parapsychological research.STATISTICAL ISSUESReplication and Comparison with ChanceFirst of all, few human capabilities are perfectly replicable on demand. Eventhe best hitters in baseball cannot produce home runs on demand, nor can wepredict with certainty when home runs will occur. But this does not mean homeruns do not occur.Statistics are used whenever there is difficulty separating signal from noise.The frequency of home runs obviously depends on the player, but for anyindividual batter in a single game it will also depend upon the skill of thepitcher, his state of mind, the angle of the sun, the wind, and probably a hostof other factors. Yet, over the long run, a good baseball player should hit theball a fairly consistent proportion of times, and we should expect fairlyconsistent differences between players.The same should be true of psi. If it exists, it may not be replicable ondemand, but over the long run in well-controlled laboratory experiments weshould expect to see a consistent level of results, above that expected bychance.Evidence based on statistics comes from comparing what actually happened withwhat would have been expected to happen if chance alone were operating. JessicaUtts, professor of statistics at the University of California at Davis,illustrates this point by noting that about 51 percent of births in the UnitedStates result in boys. If someone claimed to have a method that enabled a coupleto increase the chances of having a baby of the desired sex, then we couldexamine the validity of their claim by comparing the percentage of boys bornusing that method with the percentage expected when chance alone is operating.If the actual percentage is higher than the chance percentage of 51 percent overthe long run, then we may conclude that the claim is supported by statisticalevidence.However, simply showing that the results were greater than that expected bychance is not enough, because in smaller samples departures from chance are morelikely. No one is likely to be impressed by finding two boys in a sample of onlythree births. But where do we draw the line? Is seven boys in a sample of tenbirths sufficient evidence to establish the claim? Or do we require at least 70boys in 100 births? In order to answer questions like these, statisticians havedeveloped numerical methods for comparing actual results to those expected bychance. In assessing the results of an experiment, it is common to use the“p-value” to answer the following question: If chance alone were responsible forthese results, how likely would we be to observe results this strong orstronger? If the p-value is very small, then we would be unlikely to haveobtained these results by chance alone. Suppose, for example, someone performedan experiment with ten couples who desire boys, and out of ten births, sevenwere boys. If chance alone were responsible—that is, if the method of sexselection did not, in fact, work—then the probability of seven boys in tenbirths would be .19, or 19 percent. Thus, the result of the experiment wouldhave a p-value of 0.19.The standard convention is to use a p-value of .05 as a criterion ofsignificance; if we observe a p-value of less than .05, we say the results arestatistically significant at the 5 percent level of significance. Obviously, thesmaller the p-value the more convincingly chance can be ruled out as anexplanation for the observed results. According to the standard convention, inthe example above, seven boys out of ten births would not qualify as astatistically significant departure from chance (since .19 > .05).Note that a p-value can also be expressed in terms of odds against chance, witha p-value of .05 corresponding to results to odds against chance of about 20 to1. So, we may expect about 1 in 20 experiments to provide results significant atthe 5 percent level even if nothing but chance is responsible.Replication and Effect SizeIn the past few decades, scientists have begun to realize that replicationefforts need to take into account not only p-values but also the magnitude ofthe effect, or the effect size. This is because the p-value is heavily dependenton the size of the study. The smaller the effect size, the larger the studyrequired to attain statistical significance. Very powerful effects only requiresmall studies to convincingly rule out chance, whereas very small effectsrequire large studies.Jessica Utts illustrates this relationship with her example mentioned above:In our hypothetical sex-determination experiment, suppose 70 out of 100 birthsdesigned to be boys actually resulted in boys, for a rate of 70 percent insteadof the 51 percent expected by chance. The experiment would have a p-value of0.0001, quite convincingly ruling out chance. Now suppose someone attempted toreplicate the experiment with only ten births and found 7 boys, i.e., also 70percent. The smaller experiment would have a p-value of 0.19, and would not bestatistically significant. If we were simply to focus on that issue, the resultwould appear to be a failure to replicate the original result, even though itachieved exactly the same 70 percent boys! In only ten births it would require90 percent of them to be boys before chance could be ruled out. Yet the 70percent rate is a more exact replication of the result than the 90 percent.2[32_endnote-title.html#c4e2]Statisticians distinguish two types of errors when evaluating the results of anexperiment: The Type I error and the Type II error. A Type I error occurs whenwe mistakenly conclude that there is an effect when there really is none: thatis, it occurs when the experimental result occurred purely by chance. The levelof significance is therefore a measure of the probability of a Type I error. Inthe example above, there is a probability of .0001 that 70 boys out of 100births occurred purely by chance, and so the probability of a Type I error is,of course, .0001 (or .01 percent). A Type II error occurs when we mistakenlyconclude that there is no effect when there really is one. This typically occurswhen our sample size is too small to detect an effect as statisticallysignificant, as in the example above using only ten births.b[38_notes.html#four2]Realizing that small samples may lack the necessary statistical power to detecta weak effect size, and that individual researchers often operate with limitedtime and resources, statisticians have developed a technique calledmeta-analysis. This is essentially a set of procedures for combining the resultsof many small studies into one large study in order to see if there is anoverall effect and, if there is, to determine how big it is and whether itvaries with variations in experimental procedure. Meta-analysis is widely usedin medicine and the behavioral sciences.The final statistic we need is the confidence interval. This is expressed as arange of values around the result of our experiment: for instance, the 95percent confidence interval would be the range of values that we are 95 percentconfident contains the actual underlying effect size. Another way of looking atit is to suppose we repeat the experiment one hundred times in an identicalmanner: then about 95 percent of the results should include the “true” resultwithin their confidence intervals.c [38_notes.html#four3]In the experiment above, the 95 percent confidence interval for the study withthe sample of 100 would be 70 plus or minus 10, or (60–80); for the smallerstudy, it would be 7 plus or minus 3.57, or (3.43–10.57). Note that the firstconfidence interval does not include the chance value of 51, and so we can befairly confident that the results were not simply due to chance. Our confidenceshould increase if we find additional studies with similar results.THE REVOLUTION OF J. B. RHINEJoseph Banks Rhine’s first incursion into higher education, at Wooster Collegein Ohio, was seen as preparation for his becoming a Methodist minister. But hisfervent fundamentalist faith did not survive the intellectual challenges itencountered there, and it was soon abandoned. But like many others who had losttheir religious faith, Rhine found the materialism of the then-prevailingscientific worldview distasteful. And so, like Sidgwick and Myers before him, heturned to the study of psychic phenomena as a possible means of finding analternative to this bleak outlook without sacrificing an impeccable scientificapproach.After graduating with a Ph.D. in plant physiology, Rhine joined Duke Universityin 1927, and shortly afterward asked Karl Zener, an authority on the psychologyof perception, to design a set of cards with symbols that would be easy tovisualize but were as distinctive from each other as possible. Zener came upwith a set of twenty-five cards with five different symbols—circle, square,star, cross, and wavy lines— each repeated five times. These cards were thenused in card-guessing experiments. If chance alone were operating, over manytrials each card should be chosen about 20 percent of the time. In the 800preliminary trials Rhine and Zener carried out in 1930–31, 207 (nearly 26percent) were guessed correctly when 160 would have been expected by chance. Itwas a modest start, but it launched Rhine on his long career as an experimentalparapsychologist.What convinced Rhine that he was dealing with a genuine effect was the manner inwhich results varied according to various psychological and physiologicalconditions. For instance, Rhine found that a depressant drug, such as sodiumamytal, decreased the level of scoring, whereas a stimulant, such as caffeine,increased scores. In later experiments, Rhine would find this relationship heldtrue even when subjects were unaware of which drug they were taking.The early tests focused on telepathy, with a subject in one room trying toidentify the order of cards as they were read by a sender in another room. Rhinequickly realized the difficulty in distinguishing the effects of telepathy fromclairvoyance, and he devised an experiment to test pure telepathy, in which thesender would simply think of each successive symbol, using a coded numericalassociation unknown to the subject. Later experiments dispensed with an agentviewing the cards and were therefore tests of clairvoyance. In these tests thesubject usually tried to identify the order of the cards as they lay in anopaque envelope or in another room. Still later, Rhine introduced tests ofprecognition, in which the subject would try to guess the order of the cardsbefore they were randomly shuffled.Some of Rhine’s most impressive results came from experiments with a studentsubject named Hubert Pearce. After attaining double the scores expected bychance in some preliminary experiments, Rhine was eager to devise a test forPearce that would exclude every conceivable possibility of an explanation notrequiring ESP. Accordingly, he then asked a research assistant named GaitherPratt to perform a long-distance experiment, in which the subject, Pearce,located in one building, would attempt to identify the order of the cards asthey were handled, but not viewed, by Pratt, the experimenter, located inanother building. In this way 1,850 trials were completed, resulting in 558 hitswhen only 370 would be expected by chance. The odds against these resultsoccurring by chance were calculated to be astronomical, at 22 billion to one.By 1934, Rhine was ready to publish his findings, and this he did in a booktitled Extra-Sensory Perception, thereby introducing the acronym ESP to theEnglish language. Rhine’s book was greeted as the start of a new era, andlaboratories at other universities readily adopted the card-guessingmethodology. The scientific community was now faced with the largest body ofevidence for psychic phenomena ever collected through conventional experimentalmethods.But acceptance did not come easily. Critical articles began to appear,challenging almost every aspect of the evaluative techniques and experimentalconditions. Between 1934 and 1940, approximately sixty critical articles byforty authors appeared, primarily in the psychological literature. Since Rhinehad based his conclusions entirely on statistical analysis of data, many of theearliest criticisms focused on the statistical methods Rhine had used. One ofthe most persistent critics was a psychologist from McGill University namedChester Kellogg, who questioned the fundamental underpinnings of Rhine’sstatistical approach.3 [32_endnote-title.html#c4e3] Rhine and his colleaguesresponded to these criticisms, and the debate went back and forth, untilstatistician Burton Camp, then president of the Institute of MathematicalStatistics, finally settled the issue. At a press conference in 1937, Campreleased a statement to the press that read:Dr. Rhine’s investigations have two aspects: experimental and statistical. Onthe experimental side mathematicians, of course, have nothing to say. On thestatistical side, however, recent mathematical work has established the factthat, assuming that the experiments have been properly performed, thestatistical analysis is essentially valid. If the Rhine investigation is to befairly attacked, it must be on other than mathematical grounds.4[32_endnote-title.html#c4e4]The criticisms also focused on the methodology of the experiments, withallegations that subjects could have produced the correct answers through theuse of ordinary sensory cues. It is true that some of the early exploratoryexperiments did not provide adequate shielding against sensory cues. But whileRhine did not base major conclusions on such poorly controlled data, criticismsof these experiments distracted attention from experiments whose results couldnot be explained by sensory cues, such as the Pearce-Pratt series.With the popularity of Rhine’s book, several companies had begun marketingcommercial versions of the Zener cards. Critics pointed out that under certainconditions the cards could be read from the back, because of the printingimpression, and this explanation for the positive results began to circulate.The parapsychologists retorted that defective cards had not been used in any ofthe experiments reported in the literature, and, in any case, this defect couldnot explain the results when the cards were shielded in opaque envelopes, behinda screen, or when, as in the Pearce-Pratt series, tester and subject were indifferent buildings. And there was no way sensory cues could explain the resultsof the precognition experiments, in which the target series did not even existuntil the responses had been safely recorded.In order to answer the criticisms that had been leveled at the experimentsdescribed in Rhine’s earlier book, in 1940 Rhine and his colleagues publishedtheir book Extra-Sensory Perception after Sixty Years. The phrase after sixtyyears was a reference to 1882, the year the original SPR had been founded. InESP-60 (as the book came to be known) statistical procedures used were explainedin detail, criticisms were rebutted, and it was shown how results from the sixbest parapsychology experiments could not be explained away by any of thesecriticisms. The professional response to this book was far more positive, andparapsychology gained a measure of acceptance. Other laboratories began ESPresearch without fear of ridicule, and independent replications began to bereported.Parapsychologist Charles Honorton performed a detailed statistical review of theearly experiments, and this was his conclusion:By 1940 nearly one million experimental trials had been reported underconditions which precluded sensory leakage. These included five studies in whichthe target cards were enclosed in opaque sealed envelopes, 16 studies employingopaque screens, ten studies involving separation of subjects and targets indifferent buildings and two studies involving precognition tasks. . . . Theresults were independently significant in 27 of the 33 experiments. By the endof the 1930s there was general agreement that the better-controlled ESPexperiments could not be accounted for on the basis of sensory leakage.5[32_endnote-title.html#c4e5]There has been a widespread belief that most of the positive results came fromRhine’s laboratory at Duke University and that most of the experiments performedelsewhere failed to confirm Rhine’s results.6 [32_endnote-title.html#c4e6]Honorton investigated, and wrote:A survey of the published literature between 1934 and 1940 fails to support thisclaim. [The table below] shows all the published experimental reports duringthis period. Inspection of this table reveals that a majority (61 percent) ofthe outside replications report significant results (p < .01) and that theproportion of significant studies was not significantly greater for the DukeUniversity group.7 [32_endnote-title.html#c4e7]TABLE 4.1. BREAKDOWN OF EXPERIMENTAL ESP STUDIES (1934–1939)image [images/image85-00.jpg]Since 1940, most of the criticisms of the early results have focused on thepossibility of fraud on the part of the subject, the experimenter, or both. Oneof the most prominent critics was the English psychologist C.E.M. Hansel, whowrote that “it is wise to adopt initially the assumption that ESP is impossible,since there is a great weight of knowledge supporting this point of view.”8[32_endnote-title.html#c4e8] Hansel provided no documentation at all for thisassumption, and went on to develop elaborate fraud scenarios to explain how eachexperiment could have been accomplished by fraud on the part of subject orexperimenter.For instance, in the case of the above-mentioned Pearce-Pratt experiments,Hansel pointed out that Rhine and Pratt had failed to assign someone to watchPearce at all times during the experiment. So it was conceivable, Hansel argued,that Pearce could have left his station, made his way to where Pratt wassituated, peered through a glass window or through a trap door in the ceilingand watched Pratt as he turned over the cards while compiling the target sheet,and only then completed his own target sheet. Hansel never provided any directevidence that fraud actually did occur; he merely raised the possibility thatfraud could have occurred and thereby argued that the experiments cannot beconsidered conclusive proof of ESP. Almost forty years after ESP-60, Hanselwrote:A possible explanation other than [ESP], provided it involves only wellestablished processes, should not be rejected on the grounds of its complexity.. . . If the result could have arisen through a trick, the experiment must beconsidered unsatisfactory proof of ESP, whether or not it is finally decidedthat such a trick was, in fact, used.9 [32_endnote-title.html#c4e9]His comments show the lengths a skeptic must be prepared to go in order todiscount the early ESP experiments."},{"pageContent":"FIVEPsychokinesisMind over MatterWith ESP, we are dealing with a transfer of information; with psychokenesis (PK)we are dealing with a physical effect. But with both ESP and PK we are dealingwith the automatic realization of an intention—conscious or unconscious. Thisrealization of intention is the essential property of psi. With ESP it occurswithout the use of the recognized sense organs; with PK it occurs without theuse of our muscles.When most people think of PK, they think of claims about metal bending or oflevitation of objects. Most modern PK research involves phenomena far lessdramatic and impressive, but the evidence for these less-impressive phenomena isconsidered much sounder. Typically, skeptics dismiss dramatic reports of PK asthe work of clever illusionists. However, reports concerning the activities ofat least one individual cannot be so easily dismissed.His name was Daniel Dunglas Home, born in Scotland in 1833, raised inConnecticut, and one of the most famous international figures of the 1870s.Reports of séances with Home would strain credibility, if it were not for theprominence and respectability of many of his investigators. A typical séancewith Home, which might include a dozen sitters, might start off with the roomitself shaking. Later, the table around which all were seated might tilt, withobjects on the table staying in one place instead of sliding off. Musicalinstruments would be seen and heard playing recognizable tunes, apparentlywithout anyone playing them. The climax of the séance would often be thelevitation of a large, mahogany, dining room table. Early in his career, Homewas investigated by William Cullen Bryant, a journalist, and Dr. David Wells ofHarvard, both of whom intended to expose him as a fraud. The men were allowed toinspect the room beforehand to their satisfaction, and the séance took place ina well-lit room. This was their report:Three gentlemen, Wells, Bryant, and Edwards, seated themselves simultaneously ontop of the table, and while these men were so seated, the table started to movein various directions. After some time the table was seen to rise completelyfrom the floor and floated about in the air during several seconds, as ifsomething more solid than air was upholding it. . . . we have the certainty thatwe were not imposed upon and neither were we the victims of optical illusions.1[32_endnote-title.html#c5e1] (emphasis added)Prominent scientists who investigated Home included Robert Hare, professor ofchemistry at the Medical College of the University of Pennsylvania, and WilliamCrookes, of the SPR. Both were originally skeptics; both were impressed withHome. And, for their empiricism, both were savagely attacked by many of theircolleagues.2 [32_endnote-title.html#c5e2]Crookes had urged other scientists to witness Home’s phenomena for themselves,but few were willing to risk upsetting their preconceptions. One of the fewwell-known scientists who did respond to Crookes’s invitation was FrancisGalton. After attending three séances with Home, he was so impressed that hewrote his cousin Charles Darwin and urged him to visit Home to see for himself.In his letter dated April 19, 1872, he mentions that the séance was conducted in“full gas-light” and describes how an accordion held by its base played byitself. He goes on to say:What surprises me is the perfect openness of Miss F. and Home. They let you dowhatever you like within certain limits, their limits not interfering withadequate investigation. I really believe the truth of what they allege, thepeople who come as men of science are usually so disagreeable, opinionated andobstructive and have so little patience, that the séance rarely succeeds withthem. . . . I am convinced that the affair is no matter of vulgar legerdemainand believe it is well worth going into, on the understanding that a first ratemedium (and I hear there are only three such) puts himself at your disposal.3[32_endnote-title.html#c5e3]Darwin was impressed, and Galton wrote to Home with a letter enclosed fromDarwin. No reply came, as Home had gone to Russia, and so Crookes and Darwindecided to wait until he returned the following spring. But Home’s health, whichhad never been very good, had deteriorated, and so he never returned to England.Unfortunately, we will never know what would have happened if there had been ahistoric encounter between Darwin and Home.Was he a fraud? Home normally held his séances in good light, often in privatehouses, or occasionally in hotels. The use of machinery or of accomplices seemsout of the question. Mass hallucination? Hundreds of individuals witnessed hisphenomena, but we do not have even one instance of anyone failing to see whateveryone else claimed to see. Home remains an enigma to this day.MICRO-PKAlthough there have been some more recent investigations of large-scale PKphenomena, most notably with the Russian woman Nina Kulagina,4[32_endnote-title.html#c5e4] such investigations form only a very small part ofmodern PK research. Unfortunately, most of the research into large-scale PKeffects consists only of anecdotal reports, rather than results from controlledexperiments. Since the 1930s, most of the work has not been concerned with PKeffects that are directly observable, but rather with smaller-scale effectsdetectable only with statistical analysis: so-called micro-PK.Rhine and other researchers originally performed these experiments usingordinary dice, with subjects attempting to mentally influence which dice facewould land faceup. It quickly became apparent that, compared to results obtainedin the clairvoyance and telepathy experiments, the results with PK were veryweak. As is typical in research involving weak effects, the results from thedice-PK experiments remained controversial for years, even amongparapsychologists. But in 1990 meta-analysis was applied to the diceexperiments. Parapsychologists Dean Radin and Diane Ferrari combed theEnglish-language literature and found 148 studies performed between 1935 and1987, involving over 2,500 subjects attempting to influence more than 2.5million dice throws. For each study they calculated a 50 percent equivalent hitrate. The overall hit rate for the control studies (that is, no influenceintended) was 50.02 percent; for the experimental studies, it was 51.2 percent.Obviously a very weak effect, but for a sample of this size, the odds againstthese results occurring by chance are more than a billion to one.5[32_endnote-title.html#c5e5]Other conclusions from this study were that positive results were not negativelycorrelated with measures of study quality; results did not depend upon a handfulof a few extreme studies or upon studies coming from only a handful oflaboratories; and that the quality of the experiments significantly improvedover time, indicating that parapsychologists were responding to constructivecriticism throughout this period.THE AGE OF ELECTRONICS AND PKGerman physicist Helmut Schmidt is the world’s leading exponent of modern PKresearch. After earning his doctorate from the University of Cologne, Schmidtsettled in the United States, where, from 1965 to 1969, he worked as seniorresearch scientist at the Boeing research laboratory in Seattle. Since then,however, he has been fully committed to psi research.It was Schmidt who first introduced automated electronic testing devices into PKresearch. A random number generator (RNG), developed by Schmidt, employs anextremely rapid clock that is stopped at random intervals by the emission ofelectrons as radioactive strontium-90 decays. What is so unusual about Schmidt’sRNGs is that the precise rate of radioactive decay is theoreticallyunpredictable, and so his experiments are essentially tests to see if humanintention can influence random events at the quantum level.In order to test PK, Schmidt employed a binary counter, one that rapidly flippedback and forth between two positions (recorded as 0 or 1). This electronic coinflipper would be stopped in one of its two positions by the emission of anelectron from the radioactive material. It is theoretically impossible topredict when an electron will be emitted: the timing of the event appearscompletely random. So, in the absence of any psi effect, the behavior of the RNGshould be completely random, and an approximately equal number of 0s and 1sshould be recorded.The 0s and 1s generated by the RNG were usually presented to the subject in oneof two ways: either as a series of clicks in the left or right earpiece of a setof headphones or as a display of lights arranged in a circle. If the headphonedevice was employed, the goal of the subject was to produce more clicks in oneearpiece than in the other. With the display of lights, the situation was a bitmore complicated. If the oscillating device stopped in one position, the lightmoved one step clockwise; if it stopped in the other, it moved one stepcounterclockwise. If only chance were operating, the lights would be expected tomake a random walk around the circle, with about an equal number of clockwiseand counterclockwise moves. The goal of the subject was to “will” the lights inone direction around the circle.The absolute deviation from chance with Schmidt’s experiments was slight, butbecause the experimental design allows enormous numbers of trials to becollected in a short span of time, highly significant results can be obtained.Most modern RNG experiments are based on Schmidt’s original design, and by 1987an enormous database of results had been accumulated. In that year, Dean Radinand Roger Nelson at Princeton University searched the literature and found 832PK studies conducted by sixty-eight different investigators between 1959 and1987. These experiments all involved the use of truly random event generators(as described above) or else electronic pseudo–random number generators. Radinand Nelson subjected the database to meta-analysis, and their results, publishedin the prominent physics journal Foundations of Physics, showed an overall hitrate of about 51 percent, when 50 percent was expected by chance. Because of thesize of the database, the odds against chance were beyond a trillion to one.They also assigned each study a quality score derived from many publishedcriticisms of PK experiments and concluded:This meta-analysis shows that effects are not a function of experimentalquality, and that the replication rate is as good as that found in exemplaryexperiments in psychology and physics. . . . Skeptics often assert that only“believers” obtain positive results in such experiments. However, a thoroughliterature search finds not a single attempted replication of the RNG experimentby a publicly proclaimed skeptic.6 [32_endnote-title.html#c5e6]Of the 597 experimental studies (235 were control studies), 258 came from thePrinceton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) laboratory at PrincetonUniversity, founded by Robert Jahn in 1979. Since then, the majority of RNG PKstudies have come from the PEAR lab. Unlike Schmidt, who selected and trainedhis subjects carefully, Jahn and his colleagues have made a practice ofaccepting all comers. This has resulted in an effect magnitude not as large asthat generally found in Schmidt’s studies. Yet the PEAR lab has generated anenormous database of trials and has corroborated Schmidt’s results to a highlysignificant degree.7 [32_endnote-title.html#c5e7] In about a fourth of theexperiments, the distance between subject and the RNG was varied, with thedistance varying from a few meters to several thousand miles. Distance did notaffect the results.8 [32_endnote-title.html#c5e8]IMPLICATIONS FOR PHYSICSThe RNG devices pioneered by Schmidt are driven by purely random events at thequantum level. So the subjects in these experiments are not really shiftingmatter around but rather shifting probabilities of events in desired directions.It is useful to remember that many of our modern “laws of nature” arestatistical in nature, rather than absolutely true at all times. For instance,laws dealing with the behavior of large numbers of particles, such as the gaslaws, are true only in the statistical sense and do allow for violations, nomatter how improbable those violations may be. The smaller the number ofparticles involved, the more likely such a violation is to occur. Similarly, thesecond law of thermodynamics (disorder tends to increase) is a statistical law:if we have two rooms of equal temperature joined by a door, it is possible(though not likely) that the highest energy particles will end up in one roomand the lowest energy particles in the other. This decrease in entropy becomesmore likely the fewer the number of particles in each room.According to quantum mechanics—physics’ most successful theory to date—evenevents concerning single particles can occur in a truly random fashion; that is,some individual events and properties would be unpredictable even if we hadperfect information regarding the initial conditions. Such events and propertiescan be predicted only in the statistical sense. The experiments of Schmidt andothers suggest that human consciousness can influence the timing of theseevents. As some readers will no doubt be aware, the role that consciousnessplays in quantum mechanics is one of the burning issues in modern physics. As wewill see in chapter 10 [21_chapter-title-10.html], Schmidt’s experiments may beable to settle this controversy.FINAL POINTSSchmidt and the theoretical physicist Evan Harris Walker do not view micro-PK asa force but rather as a type of information flow from the consciousness of theobserver to the indeterminate quantum state. Rhine’s tumbling dice experimentscan be incorporated into a PK model involving quantum mechanics because the actof tumbling may introduce sufficient quantum mechanical uncertainty into thesystem to make the outcome truly random. Since it seems difficult to extend thisexplanation to macro-PK phenomena, it may be that micro-PK and macro-PK(assuming the latter is real) are two separate phenomena. But at this point, therelationship between the two, if any, is completely unknown.Skeptics of psychokinesis are fond of pointing out that there arewell-established laboratories for testing PK in Reno, Las Vegas, and MonteCarlo. So, could PK be used to beat the odds in the casinos? Not likely. The PKeffects observed in the laboratories are simply far too weak. Physicist NickHerbert has calculated that the odds in favor of the house on even the mostfavorable casino games are about one hundred times larger than most of thedeviations from chance observed in the PK experiments.9[32_endnote-title.html#c5e9] Even the most gifted micro-PK subjects do not evencome close to displaying results that would allow them to consistently beat thehouse. Furthermore, even if some forms of the PK, telepathic, or precognitiveeffects displayed in laboratories were strong enough in theory to beat thecasinos over a long run, it is highly unlikely they would work in practice.First, psi researchers, aware of their subjects’ potential for boredom andfatigue, typically limit experimental sessions to only 15 to 30 minutes.However, in order to beat the casinos over the long run, people would need toperform consistently at an optimal level, perhaps over a period of months, oreven years. Second, conditions in psi experiments are designed to be aspsi-conducive as possible, and so are generally quiet and relaxing with few, ifany, distractions. On the other hand, casinos are designed to be distracting andto prevent careful thought and concentration, with bright lights, loud music,scantily clad women, and free alcohol. Replications in science are meant to beconducted in experimental conditions as nearly identical to the originalexperiment as possible, not wildly different.Can PK ability be increased with proper training? Does it have practicalapplications? Like so many other poorly funded areas of psi research, at thispoint there are more questions than answers regarding PK. But there is one thingwe should have no doubt about: these highly significant results, coming fromseveral laboratories, have caused some skeptics a good deal of consternation.Admitting the difficulty she experiences maintaining her well-publicizedskeptical beliefs in the face of mounting experimental evidence, psychologistSusan Blackmore writes:Human beings are not built to have open minds. If they try to have open mindsthey experience cognitive dissonance. Leon Festinger first used this term. Heargued that people strive to make their beliefs and actions consistent and whenthere is inconsistency they experience this unpleasant state of “cognitivedissonance,” and they then use lots of ploys to reduce it. I have to admit Ihave become rather familiar with some of them.First, there is premature closure. You can just pick one theory and stick to itagainst all odds. . . . Or the disbeliever can refuse to look at the positiveresults. You may think I wouldn’t refuse, but I have to admit that when theJournal of Parapsychology arrives with reports of Helmut Schmidt’s positivefindings I begin to feel uncomfortable and am quite apt to put it away “to readtomorrow.”10 [32_endnote-title.html#c5e10]"},{"pageContent":"SIXTelepathySilent CommunicationBy the 1960s a number of researchers were becoming dissatisfied with therepetitive forced-choice card-guessing experiments that had been pioneered by J.B. Rhine in the 1930s. Subjects simply became bored after guessing dozens ofcards, and so researchers sought a more interesting experimental technique, onethat also would more closely replicate the conditions that seemed to facilitatepsi experiences in real life.One such condition seems to be dreaming. History records many famous psychicdreams, and cross-cultural surveys indicate that about half of all real-life psiexperiences occur during dreams.1 [32_endnote-title.html#c6e1] These findingsmotivated psychiatrist Montague Ullman and clinical psychologist StanleyKrippner at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York, to develop alaboratory technique to test telepathy in dreams. Encouraging results werereported, with odds against chance of millions to one.2[32_endnote-title.html#c6e2]Unfortunately, there have been few attempted replications of these studies. Partof the problem is that dream laboratories are notoriously expensive to run;indeed, a lack of funds caused the Maimonides Dream Lab to close in 1978. As analternative to the rather prosaic card-guessing experiments of an earlier era,the dream experiments did show promising results. So as the dream experimentsbegan to wind down in the late 1970s, parapsychologists began searching for analternative with less expensive overhead.THE GANZFELDOne of these parapsychologists was Charles Honorton, who spent several summersas an assistant at J. B. Rhine’s lab in Durham, North Carolina, then worked forseveral years as a researcher at the Maimonides Dream Lab. Honorton noted that,historically, apparent psi effects have frequently been associated not only withdreaming but with other altered states of consciousness, such as meditation andhypnosis. Spontaneous cases are, of course, anecdotal, and Honorton thought thatno conclusions should be based upon them, but he also rightly considered thatsuch cases could be used to generate hypotheses that can then be testedexperimentally. And his work at the Dream Lab convinced him that, in the case ofdreaming at least, the anecdotal reports had been experimentally corroborated toan impressive degree.These anecdotal reports and experimental findings led Honorton to postulate thatpsi may operate as a weak signal that is normally masked by the stronger signalsconstantly besieging us from our conventional sense organs. The altered statesdiscussed above—dreaming, meditation, hypnosis—have something in common:physical relaxation combined with reduced sensory input and an alert, receptivemental state. Honorton speculated that the re-creation of these conditions inthe laboratory might be an excellent technique for investigating psi. Thehypothesis formed was that, by reducing ordinary sensory noise while keeping thesubject relaxed and alert, the subject’s mind would become starved for stimuliand thus more receptive to any faint or weak signals that ordinarily would notreach consciousness. In order to test this “noise-reduction” model of psi,Honorton and other researchers turned to the ganzfeld technique.Like the dream studies, the ganzfeld procedure has most often been used to testfor telepathic communication between a sender and a receiver. Typically, thesubject is led into an acoustically sealed room and onto a comfortable recliningchair. A table tennis ball is cut in half, and the halves are placed over thesubject’s eyes. A red lamp shines above, causing the subject to see only a warm,reddish glow. Headphones are placed over the ears, and the subject is then ledthrough a progressive series of relaxation exercises designed to clear the mindof the day’s worries and distractions. After about fifteen minutes, therelaxation exercises end and a voice asks the subject to simply relax anddescribe whatever thoughts and images come to mind. For the next thirty minutesthe subject hears only a steady, not-unpleasant white noise through theheadphones and sees only the reddish glow. This is the ganzfeld, a German wordmeaning “total field” that refers to the homogeneous, undifferentiatedperceptual field that the experimenter wishes to create.About fifteen minutes after the receiver begins the relaxation exercises, asender in another acoustically sealed room opens a sealed envelope and removesthe target picture, or begins to watch a randomly chosen video clip. The targetis chosen from a large pool of potential targets, and the sender’s task is toconcentrate on the target and attempt to send the visual image to the receiver.Often there is a one-way audio link through which the sender can hear thereceiver so that the sender may adjust his or her thoughts in response to thefeedback coming from the receiver.After thirty minutes the session ends and the receiver is shown a set of fourpictures or video clips. Unlike the dream experiments, the subjects usually rankthe pictures themselves, on the grounds that they should best know what has gonethrough their own minds during the session. Each of the possibly used targetsreceives a ranking from 1 to 4, with 1 being considered a direct hit and allother rankings considered complete misses. So if chance alone is operating, wewould expect receivers to correctly guess which target was used about 25 percentof the time.By 1982, Honorton was ready to present the results of a series of ganzfeldexperiments. At the annual convention of the Parapsychological Association ofthat year, Charles Honorton summarized the results of all the forty-two ganzfeldstudies that had been published between 1974 and 1981: an amazing 55 percent ofthe studies reported statistically significant results, whereas only 5 percentwould have been expected to do so if chance alone had been operating. Itappeared that parapsychologists had finally found their long-sought repeatableexperiment.Acceptance, however, would not come easily. One of parapsychology’s mostsophisticated critics was spoiling for a fight."},{"pageContent":"SEVENThe Great Ganzfeld DebatePsychologist Ray Hyman, a longtime critic of psi research and a founding memberof CSICOP, disagreed with Honorton’s conclusions and undertook his ownmeta-analysis of the ganzfeld data. This disagreement led to a debate, theopening rounds of which were carried in two full issues of the Journal ofParapsychology in 1985 and 1986.Ray Hyman opened the debate by claiming that the estimate of 55 percentsignificant studies was far too high because of a number of problems with theforty-two studies. First of all, he pointed out that some investigators usedmore than one measure of a successful outcome (multiple-analysis); even worse,there was a possibility that some investigators had “shopped around,” applyingdifferent criteria to the data until they found a measure that was“significant.” He also raised the possibility of a bias in favor of reportingsuccessful outcomes. This is the so-called “file-drawer” problem, which allegesthat experiments with successful results tend to be reported, while theunsuccessful results simply languish in file drawers. Finally, Hyman presentedthe results of a statistical analysis that claimed to show a relationshipbetween the number of flaws in each study and the reported success: he claimedthat the most flawed studies tended to report the highest scores. Adjusting forall these factors, Hyman concluded that the actual success rate was close towhat chance would predict.Honorton agreed with the first of these criticisms, that multiple-analysis wasindeed a problem. In response, he restricted his analysis to only thosetwenty-eight studies that actually reported the hit rates obtained so that hecould calculate the percentage of direct hits, defining a successful outcomeonly as one in which the subject ranked the target in first place. Using thisuniform measure, twenty-three of the twenty-eight studies had results greaterthan the chance expectation, and 43 percent of the twenty-eight studies yieldedsignificant results. The overall hit rate was 35 percent (with 25 percentexpected by chance) and the 95 percent confidence interval ranged from 28 to 43percent. The odds against these results happening by chance alone were a billionto one.1 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e1]Honorton demonstrated that these positive results were not due to only one ortwo labs. These twenty-eight studies came from ten different labs: one lab,directed by British psychologist Carl Sargent, contributed nine of the studies,Honorton’s own lab contributed five, two other labs contributed three each, twocontributed two each, and the remaining four labs each contributed one study.Thus, half of the studies came from only two labs, one of them Honorton’s.Accordingly, Honorton analyzed the results for each lab separately and foundthat results were significant for six of the ten laboratories. Even if weexcluded the results from the two most prolific labs, the odds against chancewere still ten thousand to one.2 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e2]Thus, the positive results could not be explained by multiple-analysis, or asthe effect of just one or two labs contributing the lion’s share of the studies.Honorton then addressed Hyman’s other criticisms.SELECTIVE REPORTINGIt has long been believed that in all fields there may be a bias in favor ofreporting and publishing studies with positive outcomes. Given the controversialnature of their subject, parapsychologists were among the first to becomesensitive to this problem, and in 1975 the Parapsychological Association adopteda policy opposing the withholding of nonsignificant data, a policy unique amongthe sciences. In addition, in 1980 the skeptical British psychologist SusanBlackmore conducted a survey of parapsychologists to see if there was a bias infavor of reporting successful ganzfeld results, and she concluded that there wasnone. She uncovered only nineteen completed but unreported ganzfeld studies.Seven of these had significantly positive results, a proportion (37 percent)very similar to the proportion of the studies in the meta-analysis that achievedindependently significant outcomes (43 percent).3 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e3]Still, since it is impossible, in principle, to know how many unreported studiesmay be sitting in file drawers, Honorton used a technique of meta-analysis tocalculate just how many unreported, nonsignificant ganzfeld studies would beneeded to reduce the reported outcomes to chance levels. It turns out that forthe twenty-eight direct-hit ganzfeld studies, it would take 423 unreported,nonsignificant studies, for a ratio of unreported-to-reported studies ofapproximately fifteen to one. Given that a single ganzfeld session takes over anhour to conduct and considering the small number of laboratories in the worldequipped to conduct ganzfeld experiments, it is not surprising that Hymanconcurred with Honorton that selective reporting could not explain thesignificance of the results.4 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e4]STUDY FLAWSOne of the most frequent criticisms of psi research is that many, if not most,psi experiments have methodological flaws. It is claimed that these poorlydesigned and executed studies account for most of the positive outcomes.Furthermore, it is maintained that if these flawed studies were removed, thepositive results would vanish.Fortunately, meta-analysis provides a technique for determining the extent towhich, if any, methodological flaws can account for positive results. Each studyis rated according to the degree that a given flaw is present; these ratings arethen correlated with study outcomes. Large positive correlations between thepresence of flaws and successful outcomes would support the skeptics’ contentionthat the successful outcomes are simply due to study flaws.One of the most fatal flaws in psi research is that of sensory leakage, in whicha subject is able to gain knowledge of the target through the use of ordinarysenses, either inadvertently or through intentional cheating.Sensory LeakageWith its use of sensory deprivation and acoustically sealed rooms, the design ofthe ganzfeld tends to minimize any opportunity for sensory leakage of thetarget. Nevertheless, critics have raised some possibilities: if experimentersdealing with subjects know the target, they may somehow bias the subjects’choice. One study did contain this flaw, but there the subjects actually scoredslightly below chance. Another possibility for leakage arises if the actualphysical picture used by the sender is included in the set of pictures given tothe receiver for judging: Perhaps the receiver may consciously or unconsciouslynotice that the target picture was handled. This is the so-called greasy fingershypothesis, and although contemporary ganzfeld experiments use duplicate sets oftargets, some of the early studies did not.Hyman and Honorton both concluded that there was no systematic relationshipbetween flaws possibly leading to sensory leakage and study outcome. Honortonalso reported that, even if the studies that failed to use duplicate target setswere excluded, the results were still highly significant, with odds againstchance of about a hundred thousand to one.5 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e5]Inadequate RandomizationHyman then concentrated his attack on what he claimed were flaws inrandomization procedures. Randomization is important in ganzfeld experiments, intwo respects: each potential target must have an equal chance of being selected,and each target must not appear in a predictable position when the target poolof four pictures is presented to the subject at the end of the session.Hyman claimed that there was a significant relationship between randomizationflaws and successful outcomes; Honorton claimed that there was no suchrelationship. The source of the disagreement can be traced to conflictingdefinitions of flaws. Perhaps the differences over this part of the analysiscould be due to differences in bias. After all, Hyman is a confirmed longtimeskeptic, and Honorton had been conducting psi research for decades.However, none of the ten contributors to the subsequent debate published in 1986agreed with Hyman’s conclusions, whereas four nonparapsychologists—twostatisticians and two psychologists— explicitly agreed with Honorton’sconclusion.6 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e6] David Saunders, a psychologicalstatistician, was one of the first to independently examine Hyman’s flaw study,and he concluded that “the entire analysis is meaningless.”7[32_endnote-title.html#c7e7]Yet, it is worth pointing out that while many critics have historically arguedthat experimental flaws can explain positive results in psi experiments, Hyman’sanalysis was the first to attempt to actually quantify the relationship betweenflaws and significant results, and for this he should be congratulated. At anyrate, Hyman continued to insist that there was a positive relationship betweeninadequate randomization and study outcome, but he also finally agreed that “thepresent database does not support any firm conclusion about the relationshipbetween flaws and study outcome.”8 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e8]As mentioned above, ten additional critics and supporters of parapsychologycontributed commentary on the debate. For the most part, the critics remainedunconvinced, but there was one notable exception: the British mathematician andwell-known critic Christopher Scott described Honorton’s reasoning as “the mostconvincing argument for the existence of ESP that I have yet encountered.”9[32_endnote-title.html#c7e9]THE JOINT COMMUNIQUÉPerhaps the biggest surprise of the second round of the debate was a jointcommuniqué, coauthored by Hyman and Honorton. Instead of continuing with thedebate, the two decided to jointly write a paper, which started out listingtheir points of agreement and disagreement:We agree that there is an overall significant effect in this database thatcannot reasonably be explained by selective reporting or multiple analysis. Wecontinue to differ over the degree to which the effect constitutes evidence forpsi, but we agree that the final verdict awaits the outcome of futureexperiments conducted by a broader range of investigators and according to morestringent standards.10 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e10]They then described the more stringent standards for the conditions under whichfuture ganzfeld experiments should be conducted. These included strict securityprecautions against sensory leakage and possible fraud; required testing ofrandomization methods; and an insistence on the thorough documentation of theexperimental procedures, randomization methods, and the status of the experiment(whether it was meant to merely confirm previous findings or explore novelconditions). One of Honorton’s parapsychology colleagues pointed out that“Honorton was especially interested in getting Hyman to agree publicly to thesecriteria, as skeptics are notorious for changing the rules of the game after allprevious objections have been met and new experiments continue to providesignificant results.”11 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e11]It is worthwhile at this point to mention how very unusual this debate was, asit marked a sharp departure from the usual rhetorical exchanges betweenparapsychologists and their critics. Shortly before the opening rounds, Hymanwrote, “The level of the debate during the past 130 years has been anembarrassment for anyone who would like to believe that scholars and scientistsadhere to standards of rationality and fair play.”12[32_endnote-title.html#c7e12]After the joint communiqué, psychologist Robert Rosenthal wrote,“Parapsychologists in particular and scientists in general owe a great debt ofgratitude to Ray Hyman and Charles Honorton for their careful and extensiveanalytic and meta-analytic work on the ganzfeld problem. Their debate hasyielded an especially high light/heat ratio, and many of the important issueshave now been brought into bold relief.”13 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e13]The culmination of the second round in a joint communiqué was also remarkable,as it marked the first time a parapsychologist and a critic collaborated on ajoint statement of this type. The stage was now set to see if future ganzfeldexperiments, conducted according to these more stringent standards, wouldcontinue to provide significant results. But before the results of new ganzfeldexperiments were revealed, a rather disturbing incident occurred.THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL REPORT“Perhaps our strongest conclusions are in the area of parapsychology” continuedthe speaker, reading the prepared statement. The room was quiet as the speakerpaused for slight dramatic effect and then went on. “The committee finds noscientific justification from research conducted over a period of one hundredthirty years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena.”14[32_endnote-title.html#c7e14]The paragraph above is an account of a statement read by John Swets to a roomfulof journalists at a December 1987 press conference. Swets was the chairman of acommittee created by the National Research Council to investigate varioustechniques of enhancing human performance in which the U.S. Army was interested.He called the press conference to announce the results of this two-year, nearlyhalf-milliondollar project.Three years earlier, the U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI) asked the NationalResearch Council (NRC), a branch of the National Academy of Sciences, toevaluate various techniques of enhancing human performance, such as sleeplearning, guided imagery, meditation, telepathy, and clairvoyance. To helpensure fairness, ARI normally appointed an unbiased observer to monitor researchcontracts. But in this case, they appointed Dr. George Lawrence, a civilian armypsychologist with a history of opposition to psi research. For instance, alongwith Ray Hyman, he was instrumental in getting a Pentagon-funded parapsychologyproject at Stanford canceled in 1972.15 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e15]And when the NRC began to form subcommittees to investigate the different areas,they appointed Ray Hyman to head the parapsychology subcommittee. At the timeHyman held this position, he was an active member of the executive council ofCSICOP.The only psi studies evaluated in the report were the ganzfeld experiments, andthe NRC evaluation was based upon the meta-analysis conducted by Hyman. Althoughtwo years earlier he had agreed with Honorton that “there is an overallsignificant effect in this database that cannot reasonably be explained byselective reporting or multiple analysis” and that “significant outcomes havebeen produced by a number of different investigators,”16[32_endnote-title.html#c7e16] neither of these points is mentioned in thereport. At the press conference, Hyman announced that the “poor quality of psiresearch was a surprise to us all—we believed the work would be of much higherquality than it turned out to be.”17 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e17]The NRC committee requested several reports from outside experts, but forparapsychology, no parapsychologist was consulted. Instead, they commissionedpsychologist James Alcock to prepare a report. Like Hyman, Alcock is also amember of CSICOP and is widely known for his books and articles attackingparapsychological research.Psychologist Robert Rosenthal of Harvard University was also asked to prepare areport. Rosenthal is world-renowned as an expert in evaluating controversialresearch claims in the social sciences, and along with Monica Harris, heprepared a report on the quality of research in all five controversial areasstudied by the committee. In direct contradiction to Hyman’s remark at the pressconference, Harris and Rosenthal wrote that, of the five areas “only theganzfeld ESP studies meet the basic requirements of sound experimentaldesign.”18 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e18] Their report concluded:The situation for the ganzfeld domain seems reasonably clear. We feel it wouldbe implausible to entertain the null [that is, conclude the results are due tochance] given the combined p [probability] from these 28 studies. . . . When theaccuracy rate expected under the null is ¼, we estimate the obtained accuracyrate to be about [images/1.jpg].19 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e19]In other words, Harris and Rosenthal concluded that the ganzfeld results werenot simply due to chance and that the accuracy rate was about 33 percent, when25 percent would be expected if chance alone were responsible.Incredibly, committee chairman John Swets phoned Rosenthal and asked him towithdraw the section of his report that was favorable to parapsychology.Rosenthal refused. In the final NRC report, the Harris-Rosenthal paper is citedonly in the several sections dealing with the non-parapsychology topics. Thereis no mention of it in the section dealing with parapsychology.An extended and detailed refutation of the committee’s report was prepared bypsychologist John Palmer, Charles Honorton, and Jessica Utts, professor ofstatistics at the University of California at Davis. This paper led U.S. SenatorClaiborne Pell to request that the Congressional Office of Technology Assessmentconduct an investigation with a more balanced group. His request led to aone-day workshop held on September 30, 1988, which brought togetherparapsychologists, critics, and experts in related fields. The workshop’s reportconcluded that parapsychology needs “a fairer hearing across a broader spectrumof the scientific community, so that emotionality does not impede objectiveassessment of experimental results.”20 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e20]An article written the following year by Colonel John Alexander (U.S. Army,retired) was far more blunt. Alexander was involved with the army’sinvestigation of many of the subjects the NRC committee was asked to examine,and it seems worthwhile here to quote at length from the article he wrote as achallenge to the NRC report:I was a briefer to the NRC committee members as they researched the EHP Report.I have served as chief of Advanced Human Technology for the Army Intelligenceand Security Command (1982–84) and, during the preparation of the EHP Report,was director of the Advanced Systems Concepts Office at the U.S. Army LaboratoryCommand. I believe I am personally well qualified to review the committee’sfindings.Many organizations in the Army had already been experimenting with varioustechniques to enhance human performance and frequently they had reported somevery exciting results. . . . It was felt by several in the top leadership of theArmy that contracting such an august body as the NRC . . . would provide acredible report on which the stewardship of the public funds for Army researchallocations in the field of enhancing human performance could be based.The task of administering the contract fell to ARI. It was they who proposedthat Dr. George Lawrence, a civilian army psychologist with a background inbiofeedback, be assigned as the Contracting Officers Technical Representative(COTR). A COTR is normally an unbiased observer who does not participate in thestudy and who is there to ensure that the study is technically sound.Unfortunately . . . Lawrence was far from unbiased. He had a prior history inthe field of being firmly and publicly in opposition to several of the areas tobe studied. In fact, in a previous assignment with the U.S. Defense AdvancedResearch Projects Agency (DARPA), Lawrence had been instrumental in thecancellation of funding for psychic (“psi”) research at Stanford ResearchInstitute (SRI). . . . To accomplish that end, Lawrence had gone to SRI with awell-known critic of the psi-research field, Dr. Ray Hyman . . . Lawrence andHyman effectively killed DARPA’s funding for SRI, which was the only governmentsponsored research at the time.Prior to the formal organization of the EHP board, Lawrence told me in personalconversation in 1984 that he was seeking to get Hyman on the EHP committee, aneffort at which he proved to be successful. The issue to be raised concerningthe credibility of the EHP Report here is that the only person assigned to thecommittee who had had any previous familiarity with the parapsychologicalresearch literature was Ray Hyman—who was known from the outset to have his mindalready made up. Hyman is a founding member of the Committee for the ScientificInvestigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP)—the self-appointed vigilantecommittee that opposes parapsychological research. . . .Thus, I questioned from the beginning the issues of “bias” and “objectivity” asthey related to the committee’s constitution. For it seems clear that Lawrence,and then Hyman and James Alcock (another charter CSICOP member and public criticof this research) proceeded on an intentional path to discredit the work inparapsychology. . . . Throughout the parapsychology section of the EHP Report,the committee referred only to those published articles that supported itsposition and ignored material that did not. . . .What, then, are we to conclude about the EHP report? . . . First, it issignificant that a determined group of psi debunkers could find no “smoking gun”and no “plausible alternative” to the psi hypothesis. . . . Second, we shouldworry about the fact that the highest scientific court in the land operated insuch a biased and heavy-handed manner, and that there seems to be no channel forappeal or review of their work. What, we may ask, are they afraid of? Isprotecting scientific orthodoxy so vital that they must deny evidence andsuppress contrary opinion? 21 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e21] (emphasis added)THE AUTOGANZFELDShortly after the Congressional Office report was issued, results were presentedfrom new ganzfeld experiments that fully adhered to the tough standards spelledout in the joint communiqué. Since 1983, Honorton and his colleagues worked on anew series of ganzfeld experiments that were computer-controlled. Research withthe new automated ganzfeld system—called the autoganzfeld—continued until 1989,when lack of funding forced Honorton’s laboratory to close.The major innovations of the autoganzfeld were the use of computers to controlthe experiment and the introduction of closed-circuit video cameras to presentshort film clips and still pictures as targets. During the session, neither theexperimenter nor the receiver could monitor events inside the sender’s room,which was also acoustically sealed and electromagnetically shielded.The targets consisted of eighty still pictures (static targets) and eighty shortvideo clips, complete with sound tracks (dynamic targets), all recorded onvideotape. Since meta-analysis of the earlier experiments revealed a positiverelationship between hit rates and the use of dynamic targets, the autoganzfeldexperimenters wished to test the hypothesis that the use of dynamic targetswould result in greater success.The automated controls and sealed rooms were, of course, meant to reduce anypossibility of sensory leakage, due either to accident or intentional cheating.In addition, two “mentalists”—magicians that specialize in simulating psi—werebrought in to inspect the autoganzfeld system to see if it was vulnerable tocheating, deception, or conjuring tricks. One of these was Ford Kross, aprofessional mentalist and officer of the Psychic Entertainers Association. Heprovided the following written statement:In my professional capacity as a mentalist, I have reviewed PsychophysicalResearch Laboratories’ automated ganzfeld system and found it to provideexcellent security against deception by subjects.22[32_endnote-title.html#c7e22]The other magician was Cornell University psychologist Daryl Bem, who fullyconcurred with Kross’s assessment of the security procedures and coauthored apaper on the 1994 ganzfeld experiments with Honorton.23[32_endnote-title.html#c7e23] Bem has performed as a mentalist for many yearsand is also a member of the Psychic Entertainers Association.RESULTSDuring the six-year autoganzfeld program, 100 men and 140 women participated asreceivers in 354 sessions. The participants ranged in age from seventeen toseventy-four years old, and eight different experimenters, including Honorton,conducted the studies.Over the eleven experiments involving 354 sessions, 122 direct hits wereobtained for an overall hit rate of 34 percent, when 25 percent is expected bychance. These results are almost identical to the 35 percent hit rate obtainedin the 1985 meta-analysis. The new 95 percent confidence interval ranged from 30percent to 39 percent, and the odds against these results occurring by chanceare about 45,000 to 1.The eleven studies comprise all sessions conducted during the six years of theautoganzfeld program. In other words, there is no “file drawer” of unreportedstudies.The hypothesis that dynamic targets would yield higher hit rates was stronglyconfirmed. Overall, sessions using dynamic targets yielded hit rates of 40percent, as opposed to 27 percent with static targets.24[32_endnote-title.html#c7e24]Other results included corroboration of the relationship between psi performanceand various personal traits of the receivers, such as extraversion, previouslyreported psi experiences, and creativity or artistic ability. Successfulperformance was significantly predicted by all of these factors, but therelationship with artistic ability was particularly marked. In a session withtwenty undergraduates from the Julliard School of Performing Arts, the studentsachieved a hit rate of 50 percent, one of the highest hit rates ever reportedfor a single sample. The musicians were particularly successful: six out ofeight (75 percent) successfully identified the targets, with odds against chanceof about 250 to 1.25 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e25]HAVE THE GANZFELD RESULTS BEEN CORROBORATED?In their joint communiqué Honorton and Hyman wrote: “We agree that the finalverdict awaits the outcome of future experiments conducted by a broader range ofinvestigators and according to more stringent standards.” Autoganzfeldexperiments certainly met the “more stringent standards” requirement. Theresults were statistically significant and consistent with those in the earlierdatabase. In addition, there were reliable relationships between conceptuallyrelevant variables and psi performance, relationships that also replicatedprevious findings. Hyman commented on these studies:Honorton’s experiments have produced intriguing results. If . . . independentlaboratories can produce similar results with the same relationships and withthe same attention to rigorous methodology, then parapsychology may indeed havefinally captured its elusive quarry.26 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e26]As Hyman’s remark implies, Honorton’s autoganzfeld experiments did not satisfythe requirement that replications be conducted by “a broader range ofinvestigators.”However, by 1995 the results of the autoganzfeld experiments were replicated bythree additional laboratories, and the results are summarized below. The firstline shows the results of the first autoganzfeld replications at Honorton’sPsychophysical Research Laboratories (PRL) in Princeton, New Jersey. The nextthree lines show the results from three different laboratories in threedifferent countries.TABLE 7.1. GANZFELD REPLICATIONS AS OF 1995image [images/image112-00.jpg]Dick Bierman at the University of Amsterdam reported in 1995 results from a setof four experiments: the hit rates were 34 percent, 37.5 percent, 40 percent,and 36 percent, for a total of 124 sessions and a combined hit rate of 37percent.27 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e27] Robert Morris, Kathy Dalton, DeborahDelanoy, and Caroline Watt, also in 1995, reported results from 97 sessions atthe University of Edinburgh.28 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e28] Finally, Broughtonand Alexander reported their results in the same year for 100 sessions at theInstitute for Parapsychology in North Carolina.29 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e29]The twenty-eight studies in the original meta-analysis produced a combined hitrate of 35 percent; Robert Rosenthal later estimated the true hit rate to beabout 33 percent, when 25 percent is expected by chance alone. As can be seen inthe final row in table 7.1, the overall combined hit rate for all these studies,totaling 675 sessions, is 34 percent. It was these results that led statisticianJessica Utts at the University of California at Davis to write:This is a robust effect that, were it not in such an unusual domain, would nolonger be questioned by science as a real phenomenon. It is unlikely thatmethodological problems could account for the remarkable consistency ofresults.30 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e30]A NEW CHALLENGEThe year 1999 was marked by a challenge to Honorton’s claims of replication withthe autoganzfeld. The challenge appeared in the form of a short article bypsychologists Julie Milton and Richard Wiseman, in which they presented theresults of thirty ganzfeld studies completed since 1987, the starting datechosen so that “the studies’ designers would have had access to Hyman andHonorton’s (1986) guidelines for ganzfeld research.”31[32_endnote-title.html#c7e31] These thirty studies were retrieved from fourteenpapers written by ten different principal authors from seven laboratories,comprising altogether 1,198 sessions. No criteria were used to select thestudies: the authors simply followed a policy “of including in our database allpsi studies that used the ganzfeld technique.”32 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e32]The combined hit rate for these thirty studies is 27.5 percent, just below the95 percent confidence intervals of the first two major studies. At the end oftheir brief article Milton and Wiseman concluded:The new ganzfeld studies show a near-zero effect size and a statisticallynonsignificant overall cumulation. . . . This failure to replicate couldindicate that the autoganzfeld’s results were spurious. . . . Alternatively, thedifferences in outcome between the autoganzfeld studies and the new databasecould have been due to the latter not being carried out under psi-conduciveconditions.Whatever the reason, the autoganzfeld results have not been replicated by a“broader range of researchers.” The ganzfeld paradigm cannot at present be seenas constituting strong evidence for psychic functioning.33[32_endnote-title.html#c7e33]However, it later turned out that Milton and Wiseman had botched theirstatistical analysis of the ganzfeld experiments by failing to consider samplesize. Dean Radin simply added up the total number of hits and trials conductedin those thirty studies (the standard method of doing meta-analysis) and found astatistically significant result with odds against chance of about twenty toone.The thirty studies that Milton and Wiseman considered ranged in size from fourtrials to one hundred, but they used a statistical method that simply ignoredsample size (N). For instance, say we have three studies, two with N = 8, 2 hits(25 percent), and a third with N = 60, 21 hits (35 percent). If we ignore samplesize, then the unweighted average percentage of hits is only 28 percent; but thecombined average of all the hits is just under 33 percent. This, in simplestterms, is the mistake they made. Had they simply added up the hits and missesand then performed a simple one-tailed t-test, they would have found resultssignificant at the 5 percent level. As statistician Jessica Utts later pointedout, had Milton and Wiseman performed the exactly accurate binomial test, theresults would have been significant at less than the 4 percent level, with oddsagainst chance of twenty-six to one.Not only that, but Milton and Wiseman did not include a large and highlysuccessful study by Kathy Dalton due to an arbitrary cut-off date, even thoughit was published almost two years before Milton and Wiseman’s paper;34[32_endnote-title.html#c7e34] had been widely discussed among parapsychologists;was part of a doctoral dissertation at Julie Milton’s university; and waspresented at a conference chaired by Wiseman two years before Milton and Wisemanpublished their paper.There was yet another problem with the Milton and Wiseman study. In their jointcommuniqué, Hyman and Honorton asked future ganzfeld investigators, as part oftheir “more stringent standards,” to clearly document the status of theexperiment; that is, whether it was meant to merely confirm previous findings orto explore novel conditions.35 [32_endnote-title.html#c7e35] The problem withthe Milton and Wiseman study was that it simply lumped all studies together,regardless of whether the status of each study was confirmatory or exploratory.In other words, Milton and Wiseman made no attempt to determine the degree towhich the individual studies complied with the standard ganzfeld protocol asspelled out in the joint communiqué.Milton and Wiseman’s paper led to a vigorous online debate, culminating in apaper published in the Journal of Parapsychology, jointly written by apsychologist and two parapsychologists. After a brief summary of the debate sofar, Bem, Palmer, and Broughton wrote:One of the observations made during the online debate was that several studiescontributing negative z scores to the analysis [that is, results were less thanexpected by chance] had used procedures that deviated markedly from the standardganzfeld protocol. Such a development is neither bad nor unexpected. Many psiresearchers believe that the reliability of the basic procedure is sufficientlywell established to warrant using it as a tool for the further exploration ofpsi. Thus, rather than continuing to conduct exact replications, they have beenmodifying the procedure and extending it into unknown territory. Notunexpectedly, such deviations from exact replication are at increased risk forfailure. For example, rather than using visual stimuli, Willin modified theganzfeld procedure to test whether senders could communicate musical targets toreceivers. They could not. When such studies are thrown into an undifferentiatedmeta-analysis, the overall effect size is thereby reduced, and perversely, theganzfeld procedure becomes a victim of its own success.36[32_endnote-title.html#c7e36]Bem, Palmer, and Broughton set out to test their hypothesis that the decline inaverage scoring was due to the studies that were meant to be exploratory ratherthan confirmatory. Accordingly, three independent raters unfamiliar with therecent ganzfeld studies, and unaware of each study outcome, were asked to ratethe degree to which each of the recent studies deviated from the standardganzfeld protocol. The database was then reexamined to test the hypothesis thathit rates were positively correlated with the degree to which the experimentalprocedures adhered to the standard protocol.The raters assigned a rank to each of the forty studies, and the ranks were thenaveraged for each study. The ranking ranged from 1 to 7, with a rank of 7indicating the highest degree of adherence to standard protocol as described intwo articles written by Honorton in the early 1990s.RESULTSAs hypothesized, hit rates were significantly correlated with the degree towhich the experimental procedures adhered to the standard protocol. If we defineas “standard” those studies that ranked above the midpoint of the scale (4),then the standard replications obtained an overall hit rate of 31.2 percent; thenonstandard studies obtained a hit rate of only 24 percent. The results are evenmore dramatic if we consider only those replication studies ranked 6 and above:these twenty-one studies (more than half the sample) achieved an overall hitrate of 33 percent, almost identical to that of the earlier studies.There is little point in continuing with more replication studies: some of thosewith a prior commitment to contrary views may never change their publicly statedopinions, no matter how many replication studies are performed. Real progresscan only be made if investigators are willing to explore new frontiers.Results from the ganzfeld experiments are summarized in table 7.2. These shouldbe compared with table 7.1. Table 7.3 summarizes all reported ganzfeldexperiments performed over nearly three decades.These figures should make the conclusion clear: the earlier results have beenreplicated by a variety of researchers in different laboratories in differentcultures, with similar hit rates. In 1996 Hyman wrote: “The case for psychicfunctioning seems better than it has ever been. . . . I also have to admit thatI do not have a ready explanation for these observed effects.”37[32_endnote-title.html#c7e37] Hyman and the other skeptics have lost theganzfeld debate.TABLE 7.2. STANDARD GANZFELD REPLICATIONS FROM 1996 FORWARDimage [images/image117-00.jpg]TABLE 7.3. ALL GANZFELD STUDIES 1974–1999image [images/image117-01.jpg]SOME NOTES ON EFFECT SIZE AND SAMPLE SIZEAs we have seen, researchers have isolated a few variables, such as artisticability and the use of dynamic targets, which seem to enhance psi performancebeyond what we may typically expect. But the overall hit rate so far seemsfairly consistent at around 33 percent, when 25 percent is expected by chance.This corresponds with a hit about every third session, when chance would predictone out of every four.This may not seem very impressive, but it may be instructive to compare theseresults with that of a major medical study that sought to determine whetheraspirin can reduce the risk of a heart attack. The study was discontinued aftersix years, because it was already clear that taking aspirin reduced the risk,and it was considered unethical to keep this treatment away from the controlgroup taking a placebo. The results of this study were publicized as a majormedical breakthrough, but the size of the aspirin effect is quite small: Takingaspirin reduces the probability of a heart attack by only .8 percent. This isabout ten times as small as the effect observed in the ganzfeld experiments.38[32_endnote-title.html#c7e38]The fact that the size of the effect observed in the ganzfeld experiments isusually not large enough to be observed without the aid of statistics partlyexplains why the controversy has continued as long as it has. When effect sizesare small, large samples are required to provide the statistical power necessaryto detect the effect. The aspirin study mentioned above was performed with over22,000 participants. If it had been conducted with only 2,200 participants, theresults would not have attained statistical significance.If the true hit rate in the ganzfeld studies were only 33 percent when 25percent was expected by chance, then an experiment with thirty sessions (theaverage for the twenty-eight studies in the 1985 meta-analysis) has only aboutone chance in six of finding an effect significant at the 5 percent level. Withfifty sessions, the chance rises to about one in three. One has to increase thesample size to one hundred sessions in order to reach the breakeven point, atwhich there is a 50/50 chance of finding a significant effect.39[32_endnote-title.html#c7e39]Some skeptics seem to have difficulty grasping the importance of sample size, orperhaps they simply choose to ignore it. Statistician Jessica Utts emphasizesthis point: “When dealing with a small to medium effect, it takes hundreds orsometimes thousands of trials to establish ‘statistical significance.’ . . .Despite Professor Hyman’s continued protests about parapsychology lackingrepeatability, I have never seen a skeptic attempt to perform an experiment withenough trials to even come close to ensuring success.”40[32_endnote-title.html#c7e40]"},{"pageContent":"EIGHTThe Research of the SkepticsCharles Honorton, in his classic article “Rhetoric over Substance,” noted animportant difference between the psi controversy and more conventionalscientific disputes. Controversies in science normally occur between groups ofresearchers who formulate hypotheses, design experiments, and then collect datain order to test their hypotheses. But as Honorton wrote, “In contrast, the psicontroversy is largely characterized by disputes between a group of researchers,the parapsychologists, and a group of critics who do not do experimentalresearch to test psi claims or the viability of their counterhypotheses.”1[32_endnote-title.html#c8e1]This lack of research may surprise anyone whose main source of information hasbeen the skeptical literature. For instance, in 1983 the well-known skepticMartin Gardner wrote:How can the public know that for fifty years skeptical psychologists have beentrying their best to replicate classic psi experiments, and with notableunsuccess? It is this fact more than any other that has led to parapsychology’sperpetual stagnation. Positive evidence keeps coming from a tiny group ofenthusiasts, while negative evidence keeps coming from a much larger group ofskeptics.2 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e2]But as Honorton pointed out, “Gardner does not attempt to document thisassertion, nor could he. It is pure fiction. Look for the skeptics’ experimentsand see what you find.”For the most part, skeptics have simply criticized from the sidelines and haveproduced no experimental research of their own.THE RESEARCH OF SUSAN BLACKMOREOne notable exception to this rule has been British psychologist SusanBlackmore. She began working on a Ph.D. in parapsychology in the 1970s, but shehas repeatedly claimed that she has failed to find any evidence for theexistence of psi. For instance, she wrote in 1996: “When I decided to become aparapsychologist I had no idea it would mean 20 years of failing to find theparanormal.”3 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e3] Blackmore has made a career forherself as one of the world’s most well-known skeptics of psi, and in 1988 shewas elected a Fellow of CSICOP.In a number of publications, Blackmore claims to have become increasinglyskeptical of the existence of psi phenomena after “ten years of intensiveresearch in parapsychology.”4 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e4] These claims ledparapsychologist Rick Berger to critically examine the Blackmore experiments ingreat detail, and he found that “the claim of ‘ten years of psi research’actually represents a series of hastily constructed, executed, and reportedstudies that were primarily conducted during a 2-year period.”5[32_endnote-title.html#c8e5] These consisted of a set of experiments conductedbetween October 1976 and December 1978 for her Ph.D. dissertation.Blackmore reported twenty-nine experiments completed over this two-year period,of which twenty-one were eventually published as separate experiments in fiveparapsychology journal papers. Seven of these experiments produced statisticallysignificant results. Although these experiments form the basis of Blackmore’sclaim of “failing to find the paranormal,” the odds against seven successes outof twenty-one attempts happening by chance are over twenty thousand to one!So how does Blackmore reconcile the fact of seven successful experiments out oftwenty-one total experiments with her often-repeated claim that her own researchled her to become a skeptic? Simple: As Berger pointed out, Blackmore applied adouble standard to her experiments. When her experiments seemed to show evidenceof psi, the results were dismissed as due to flaws in the experiment. But whenthe results did not seem to show evidence of psi, she simply ignored the qualityof the study.There are many design flaws that can lead to false positive results, but thereare also many that can lead to false negatives, such as inadequate sample size(low statistical power), inappropriate sampling, and so forth. Berger writes,“Blackmore’s database is replete with examples of such flaws,”6[32_endnote-title.html#c8e6] and continues:Some skeptics, including Blackmore, argue that differing standards ofexperimental design can be held depending on study outcome: Significant positiveoutcomes must have tighter designs than the same study with a negative outcome.This post hoc determination of experimental criticism leads to the paradoxexemplified by the Blackmore work: Had such work produced consistently positiveoutcomes, the results could all be dismissed as having arisen from design flaws.. . . Negative conclusions based on flawed experiments must not be given moreweight than positive conclusions based on the same flawed experiments.7[32_endnote-title.html#c8e7]In other words, our decision to invoke study flaws to dismiss the results of anexperiment should not be influenced by our preconceptions of what the result“should have been.” But this seems to have been exactly what Blackmore has donein order to justify her beliefs, as evidenced in the following remark of hers:Well, if you don’t find evidence of ESP, what can you say? Only that you havefailed to find something which, according to science, shouldn’t have been therein the first place!8 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e8]As we shall see, this appeal to “science” as a monolithic body of conclusionsthat tell you in advance how experiments should turn out is a rhetorical tacticoften used by Blackmore. Berger finally concluded:Blackmore’s claims that her database shows no evidence of psi are unfounded,because the vast majority of her studies were carelessly designed, executed, andreported, and in Blackmore’s own assessment, individually flawed. As such, noconclusions should be drawn from this database. . . . Blackmore is extremelyvocal in decrying psi research in her writings, on television and radio, andbefore the skeptical advocacy group CSICOP (the Committee for ScientificInvestigation of Claims of the Paranormal), citing her own work as the basis forher strong convictions.9 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e9]And in a follow-up article Berger wrote:Blackmore has achieved a notable position in the skeptical community based onher conversion from believer to skeptic during her “ten years of negativeresearch.” Her insistence to the contrary notwithstanding, I believe that myreview of her psi research has achieved a constructive end by showing that herconversion from parapsychologist to CSICOP Fellow had no scientific basis in herown experimental work.10 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e10]The same journal issue also includes a response by Blackmore to Berger’scritique, in which Blackmore conceded, “I agree that one cannot draw conclusionsabout the reality of psi based on these experiments.”11[32_endnote-title.html#c8e11] Near the end of his critique, Berger had written,“During my aborted meta-analysis of Blackmore’s published work, I was struck bypatterns in the data suggestive of the operation of psi. . . . Without a seriousmeta-analysis of the original unpublished source material, complete withweighting for flaws, . . . the issue of whether the Blackmore experiments showevidence for psi cannot be resolved.”12 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e12] Presumablyeager to nip this embarrassment in the bud, Blackmore hastened to add: “I amglad to be able to agree with his final conclusion—‘that drawing any conclusion,positive or negative, about the reality of psi that are based on the Blackmorepsi experiments must be considered unwarranted.’”13[32_endnote-title.html#c8e13]It is interesting to examine Blackmore’s writings before and after Berger’scritique. Two years earlier, in an article for the Skeptical Inquirer titled“The Elusive Open Mind: Ten Years of Negative Research in Parapsychology,” shewrote:How could I weigh my own results against the results of other people, bearing inmind that mine tended to be negative ones while everyone else’s tended to bepositive ones? I had to find some kind of balance here. At one extreme I couldnot just believe my own results and ignore everyone else’s. . . . At the otherextreme I could not believe everyone else’s results and ignore my own. Thatwould be even more pointless. There would have been no point in all those yearsof experiments if I didn’t take my own results seriously.”14[32_endnote-title.html#c8e14] (emphasis added)In another article published at about the same time, she wrote:The other major challenge to the skeptic’s position is, of course, the fact thatopposing positive evidence exists in the parapsychological literature. Icouldn’t dismiss it all. This raises an interesting question: just how muchweight can you or should you give the results of your own experiments over thoseof other people? On the one hand, your own should carry more weight, since youknow exactly how they were done. . . . On the other hand, science is necessarilya collective enterprise. . . . So I couldn’t use my own failures as justifiableevidence that psi does not exist. I had to consider everyone else’s success.I asked myself a thousand times, as I ask the reader now: Is there a rightconclusion?The only answer I can give, after ten years of intensive research inparapsychology, is that I don’t know.15 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e15]After Berger’s critique, Blackmore was willing to concede in an academic journalthat “I agree that one cannot draw conclusions about the reality of psi based onthese experiments.” But her writings in the popular press have not reflectedthis admission, published in 1989. Commenting on the ganzfeld experiments in anewspaper article in 1996, she wrote:My own conclusion is biased by my own personal experience. I tried my firstganzfeld experiment in 1978, when the procedure was new. . . . Of course the newautoganzfeld results are even better. Why should I doubt them because of eventsin the past? The problem is that my personal experience conflicts with thesuccesses I read about in the literature and I cannot ignore either side. Theonly honest reaction is to say “I don’t know.”16 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e16]a[38_notes.html#eight1]Wouldn’t a more honest reaction be for Blackmore to admit in the popular pressthat “one cannot draw conclusions about the reality of psi” based upon her ownexperiments, and that a scientific opinion should be based only upon a criticalevaluation of other people’s published works?But perhaps this is asking too much. After all, Blackmore pursued a Ph.D. inparapsychology in order to become a “famous parapsychologist.”17[32_endnote-title.html#c8e17] Having failed to produce research supporting thepsi hypothesis, she evidently decided to try to make a name for herself byattacking the psi hypothesis, which must at the time have seemed to be an easytarget. Apparently, though, in a recent article she claims to have given up. “Atlast, I’ve done it. I’ve thrown in the towel,” she wrote.Come to think of it, I feel slightly sad. It was just over thirty years ago thatI had the dramatic out-of-body experience that convinced me of the reality ofpsychic phenomena. . . . Just a few years of careful experiments changed allthat. I found no psychic phenomena. . . . I became a sceptic. [emphasis added]So why didn’t I give up then? There are lots of bad reasons. Admitting you arewrong is always hard, even though it’s a skill every scientist needs to learn.And starting again as a baby in a new field is a daunting prospect. So is losingall the status and power of being an expert. I have to confess I enjoyed myhard-won knowledge.. . . None of it ever gets anywhere. That’s a good enough reason for leaving.But perhaps the real reason is that I am just too tired—and tired above all ofworking to maintain an open mind. I couldn’t dismiss all those extraordinaryclaims out of hand. After all, they just might be true, and if they were thenswathes of science would have to be rewritten.18 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e18]THE RESEARCH OF RICHARD WISEMANAnother British psychologist, Richard Wiseman, now carries on where Blackmorehas left off. Wiseman is very well funded by a variety of skepticalorganizations, is a member of CSI, and frequently appears in the British mediato criticize, condemn, and generally debunk psi research. Wiseman was brieflymentioned earlier, as one of the authors of the report that attempted to refutethe results from the ganzfeld experiments using flawed methodology and botchedstatistics.Like Blackmore, Wiseman is unusual among skeptics in the sense that he sometimesactually does experiments, instead of merely criticizing from the sidelines.And, like Blackmore, Wiseman has been very vocal with claims that he has neverfound any evidence of psi. Let us now examine some of Wiseman’s research, whichhas frequently been reported in the British press.One of Wiseman’s most highly publicized experiments concerned a dog namedJaytee. His owner, Pamela Smart, claimed that the dog could anticipate herarrival home, even when she arrived home at unpredictable times. Pamela adoptedJaytee, a mixed-breed terrier, when he was only a few weeks old, and Jayteebecame very attached to her. When Pam was working as a secretary in Manchester,England, she would leave Jaytee with her parents, who were retired and lived ina flat next door. Her parents noticed that, on most weekdays around 4:30 p.m.,Jaytee would wait by the French window when Pam was on her way home. Since Pamworked routine hours, her parents assumed that the dog’s behavior was based uponsome sense of time.Pam was laid off in 1993, and for a while she no longer kept regular hours.However, her parents noticed that Jaytee still seemed to anticipate Pam’sreturn, even when Pam returned at completely unpredictable times. It seemed asthough Jaytee would begin waiting by the window at about the time she set off onher homeward journey.In April 1994 Pam read an article in the Sunday Telegraph about research intoanimals that seem to know when their owners were coming home, being undertakenby biologist Rupert Sheldrake, whom we met earlier. She contacted Sheldrake andvolunteered to take part in his research. The first stage of the researchrequired Pam’s parents to keep a log of the dog’s behavior when Pam was out.Between May 1994 and February 1995, they made notes of Jaytee’s reactions on onehundred occasions when Pam was out; Pam also recorded where she went, how longshe was out, how far she traveled, how she returned, and when she set off tocome home. On eighty-five of these one hundred occasions, the log indicated thatJaytee began to wait at the French window before Pam returned, usually tenminutes or more in advance.When Sheldrake analyzed the data statistically, he found that Jaytee’s reactionswere very significantly related to the time that Pam set off for home. It alsodid not seem to matter how far away Pam was, or what vehicle—her own car, abicycle, or a taxi—she used to return.However, on fifteen out of one hundred occasions, Jaytee did not react. On someof these occasions the researchers could find an obvious explanation: Jaytee wasill, or there was a bitch in heat in a neighbor’s flat. But on three of theseoccasions there was no obvious explanation. So, Jaytee did not always react asPam set off for home, and he could be distracted.By this stage Sheldrake decided that it was important to start taping Jaytee’sbehavior, so that more precise and objective records could be kept. Just at thispoint, Sheldrake was approached by the science unit of the Austrian StateTelevision (ORF), which expressed interest in filming an experiment with Jaytee.An experiment was designed in which one film crew would continuously film Jayteein Pam’s parents’ flat, while the other would follow Pam as she went out andabout.The experiment took place in November 1994. Pam was sent out on an excursion andneither she nor her parents knew the randomly selected time she would be askedto return. Three hours and fifty minutes later, she was asked to return home.When the experiment was broadcast, the screen was split in two, showing Pam onone side and Jaytee on the other, in perfect time synchronization. Before Pam isasked to return, Jaytee spends most of his time lying at the feet of Mrs. Smart.Almost immediately after Pam is told it is time to go home, Jaytee shows signsof alertness, pricking up his ears. Eleven seconds after Pam is told to return,as she is walking to the taxi stand, Jaytee goes to the window and stays thereuntil Pam returns, ten minutes later.There seems to be no way that Jaytee could have known by normal sensory meansthat Pam was returning. Since Jaytee responded before Pam actually climbed intothe taxi, he seemed to have responded to Pam’s intentions. In other words,Jaytee’s response appears to be telepathic.After receiving a grant from the Lifebridge Foundation of New York, Sheldrakebegan his own videotaped experiments with Jaytee in May 1995. Between May 1995and July 1996, thirty videotapes were made of Jaytee’s behavior under naturalconditions while Pam was out and about. Pam’s parents were not told when shewould be returning, and Pam usually was not sure herself. The results showedthat Jaytee waited at the window far more when Pam was on her way home than whenshe was not, and this difference was highly statistically significant (p <0.000001).The researchers discovered early on that Jaytee responded even when Pam set offat randomly selected times. This was an important discovery, as it seemed toclearly rule out an explanation based upon routine, or expectations based uponthe behavior of her parents. Consequently, twelve more experiments werevideotaped in which Pam returned home at random times, determined by the throwof dice after she had left her home.image [images/image129-00.jpg]Figure 8.1. Sheldrake’s results: random returns homeFigure 8.1 [18_chapter-title-8.html#fig81] shows the results of these twelvevideotaped experiments.The chart clearly shows that Jaytee was at the window far more when Pam was onher way home than during the main period of her absence (55 percent versus 4percent). The difference is highly statistically significant, with a p-value of.0001, implying odds against chance of over ten thousand to one.The general pattern of Jaytee’s response can be seen more clearly in thefollowing three graphs in figure 8.2 [18_chapter-title-8.html#fig82], whichsummarize the average results from long, medium, and short absences. Thehorizontal axis shows the series of ten-minute periods (p1, p2, etc.) from thetime Pam went out until she was on her way home. The last period shows the firstten minutes of Pam’s return journey. The graphs clearly show that Jaytee spentmore time at the window during Pam’s return journey, and also that he usuallystarted waiting at the window shortly before she set off, as she was thinking ofreturning.Following the televised experiment carried out by ORF, a number of reports aboutthis research appeared in British and European television and newspapers.Journalists sought out a skeptic to comment on the results, and the obviouschoice for many was Richard Wiseman. He suggested a number of possibleexplanations, such as routine times of return and selective memory, thatSheldrake had already tested and eliminated. However, rather than debate theissue, Sheldrake simply invited Wiseman to perform some tests of his own. Pamand her family kindly agreed to help him.image [images/image130-00.jpg]image [images/image130-01.jpg]image [images/image130-02.jpg]Figure 8.2. Time course data of Jaytee’s visit to the window during Pam’s long,medium, and short absences. The graphs represent the averages of eleven long,seven medium, and six short experiments. Source: Sheldrake, Dogs That Know WhenTheir Owners Are Coming Home, 61.In his four experiments, Wiseman himself videotaped Jaytee, while his assistant,Matthew Smith, went out with Pam and videotaped her. They went out to pubs orother places five to eleven miles away, and they returned at times selectedrandomly by Smith once they were out. Smith himself knew in advance when theywould be returning, but he did not tell Pam until it was time to go. Wiseman,back in the apartment, did not know when they would be returning. Furthermore,Pam and Smith traveled by taxi or by Smith’s car, in order to eliminate thepossibility that Jaytee was listening for the sound of a familiar vehicle. Threeof Wiseman’s experiments with Jaytee were performed in the flat of Pam’sparents, similar to the experiments Sheldrake had conducted. The fourthexperiment was performed in the flat of Pam’s sister, but Jaytee fell ill duringthe experiment.The results from Wiseman’s three experiments in Pam’s parents’ flat are shown infigure 8.3 [18_chapter-title-8.html#fig83].As in Sheldrake’s experiments, Jaytee was at the window much more when Pam wason her way home than during the main period of her absence (78 percent versus 4percent). With only three experiments, the sample size was small, but theresults were still statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.03. In otherwords, Wiseman had replicated Sheldrake’s results.image [images/image131-00.jpg]Figure 8.3. Wiseman’s resultsHowever, much to Sheldrake’s astonishment, in the summer of 1996 Wiseman went toa series of conferences announcing that he had refuted the “psychic pet”phenomenon, and later he appeared on a series of television shows claiming tohave refuted Jaytee’s abilities. How did he justify his conclusions?Simple: Wiseman used an arbitrary criterion for success in the experiment, acriterion that enabled him to ignore most of the data he gathered. If Jayteewent to the window “for no apparent reason” at any time during the experiment,Wiseman simply ignored all the rest of the data and declared the experiment afailure. These “failures” occurred during the 4 percent of the time Jaytee wasat the window when Pam was absent. After these “failures,” the rest of the datawas ignored, even though Jaytee was at the window 78 percent of the time whenPam was on her way home.Sheldrake met with Wiseman in September 1996 and pointed out to Wiseman that hisdata showed the same pattern as the data Sheldrake had gathered. Sheldrake madeit clear that, far from refuting Sheldrake’s results, Wiseman’s own datareplicated them. He even gave Wiseman copies of graphs showing Wiseman the datafrom his own experiments. Figure 8.4 [18_chapter-title-8.html#fig84], forinstance, shows the graphs from the three experiments that Wiseman did withJaytee in Pam’s parents’ apartment.By Wiseman’s standards, only the fourth experiment—the one performed in Pam’ssister’s apartment—was a partial success, because only in this trial did Jayteego to the window “for no apparent reason” for the first time during the periodPam was on her way home. (The videotape record showed that his visit to thewindow coincided exactly with Pam setting off on her way home). However, Wisemandid not consider the fourth trial a success, because Jaytee did not stay therefor at least two minutes, but instead he left the window and vomited.Over the next two years, Wiseman repeatedly announced through the media that hehad discredited the dog’s ability to anticipate his owner’s return. Forinstance, on a British television program called Strange but True, he said ofJaytee: “In one out of four experiments he responded at the correct time—not avery impressive hit rate, and it could just be a coincidence.”19[32_endnote-title.html#c8e19] The three “misses” are the experiments summarizedin figure 8.4 [18_chapter-title-8.html#fig84].image [images/image133-00.jpg]image [images/image133-01.jpg]image [images/image133-02.jpg]Figure 8.4. Wiseman’s results, three experiments in Pam’s flat. The periodsafter which Wiseman ignored the data are indicated by arrows. The final pointson each graph represent the first ten minutes of Pam’s return journey, indicatedby a filled circle.Wiseman dismissed Sheldrake’s graphical analysis of his data, calling it “posthoc” (Latin for “after this”), implying that it is somehow unscientific tographically analyze data someone else has collected. However, it is important toremember that Sheldrake applied exactly the same graphical analysis to his owndata two months before Wiseman arrived on the scene and for two years afterward.As mentioned, Wiseman used an arbitrary criterion that enabled him to ignoremost of the data he gathered: if Jaytee went to the window “for no apparentreason” at any time during the experiment, Wiseman simply ignored all the restof the data and declared the experiment a failure. An analogy would be ifWiseman set out to test the claim that a radical new treatment is more effectivein treating a form of cancer than conventional treatments; set the criterionthat if any patient in the control group showed an improvement “for no apparentreason” at any time during the experiment, then the experiment would be declareda failure; used this criterion to ignore the majority of his data; and thenannounced to the press that his experiment shows that this new treatment doesnot have a greater success rate in treating cancer, despite long-term evidenceto the contrary.Sheldrake made two claims based on his data: (1) the dog spends more time at thewindow when his owner is on the way home than when she is not, and (2) thisdifference is statistically significant. Wiseman’s data shows the same pattern.It should be obvious that whether or not the dog went to the window at any timefor “no apparent reason” is irrelevant with regard to the truth or falsity ofthese two claims.During the controversy that followed, Susan Blackmore came to Wiseman’s aid in anewspaper article, claiming that there was a fatal flaw in Sheldrake’sexperiment.Sheldrake did 12 experiments in which he beeped Pam at random times to tell herto return. Now surely Jaytee could not be using normal powers, could he? No. Butthere is another simple problem. When Pam first leaves, Jaytee settles down anddoes not bother to go to the window. The longer she is away, the more often hegoes to look.20 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e20]Blackmore’s point is simply that Jaytee spends more and more time by the windowthe longer Pam is out, and so of course he spends more time by the window as Pamis on her way home, but not because of any telepathic ability. But anyone wholooks at the actual data can easily see that Blackmore’s remark is simply nottrue. For instance, in figure 8.2 [18_chapter-title-8.html#fig82], we can seethat, during the short absences, Jaytee spends the most time by the window whenPam is on her way home, but there is no comparable increase in time spent at thewindow in this same period during the medium and long absences. Likewise, thespike in time Jaytee spends by the window when Pam is on her way home during themedium absences does not show up in period 11 of the long absences.Sheldrake also made a series of videotapes on evenings when Pam was not cominghome until very late, or staying out all night (figure 8.5). These tapes serveas controls, and they show that Jaytee did not go to the window more and morethe longer Pam is away.Once again, a close examination of the evidence shows the need to treat theclaims of the skeptics with skepticism.image [images/image135-00.jpg]Figure 8.5. Time spent by Jaytee at the window on evenings when Pam was notcoming home during the experiment, in ten-minute periods. Averages from tenevenings.In public lectures and on TV shows, Wiseman claimed over and over again that hehad refuted Jaytee’s abilities. As recently as April 2004, he was still makingthis claim on his website.b [38_notes.html#eight2] However, as Sheldrake notes,“His presentations are deliberately misleading.”He makes no mention of the fact that Jaytee waits by the window far more whenPam is on her way home, nor does he refer to my own experiments. He gives theimpression that my evidence is based on one experiment filmed by a TV company,rather than on more than two hundred experiments, and he implies that he hasdone the only rigorous scientific tests of this dog’s abilities. I confess thatI am amazed by his persistence in this deception.21[32_endnote-title.html#c8e21]Despite the fact that his criticism of the ganzfeld studies has been shown to beclearly flawed, and despite the fact that his own experiments with Jayteeclearly replicated Sheldrake’s results, Wiseman still cheerfully tells the mediathat he has “never come across a paranormal experiment that can bereplicated.”22 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e22]c [38_notes.html#eight3]JAMES RANDIAt least Blackmore is willing to admit that results from the best experimentsleave her stumped. But another well-known critic simply ignores the ganzfeldstudies; indeed, his work is so irrelevant to serious psi research that, for themost part, parapsychologists simply ignore it. In his classic article onskepticism, Honorton devotes only one paragraph to him:Randi’s contribution is pure polemic and fails to deal in any substantive waywith the scientific issues underlying the psi controversy. His disparagingcomments about meta-analysis suggest that he does not understand meta-analysisand is unaware of its widespread use in medicine and the behavioral sciences.Randi’s skill as a magician is well-known; but despite well-publicized claims tomethodological expertise, his ability to design scientifically adequate psiexperiments is not at all apparent from an examination of his public efforts.Serious methodological weaknesses and statistical errors occur, for example, inhis book on testing ESP and in his televised tests of psychics.23[32_endnote-title.html#c8e23]Here is Randi’s opinion of academic freedom, taken from his book Flim Flam!Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions.The public has been badly served by scientists who lean upon their considerablereputations in other fields to give weight to their declarations on the subjectof parapsychology. I have noted that possession of a driver’s license permitsone to drive an automobile only if the privilege is not abused; perhaps Ph.D.sshould similarly be withdrawable in science.24 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e24]Randi (a nonscientist) obviously thinks that any scientist who disagrees withCSICOP’s narrow brand of scientific fundamentalism should be excommunicated forthe crime of heresy. One such scientist would surely be Rupert Sheldrake, whoearned his Ph.D. in biochemistry at Cambridge University. Here is Sheldrake’saccount of his experiences with Randi:The January 2000 issue of Dog World magazine included an article on a possiblesixth sense in dogs, which discussed some of my research. In this article Randiwas quoted as saying that in relation to canine ESP, “We at the JREF [JamesRandi Educational Foundation] have tested these claims. They fail.” No detailswere given of these tests. I emailed James Randi to ask for details of this JREFresearch. He did not reply. He ignored a second request for information too.I then asked members of the JREF Scientific Advisory Board to help me find outmore about this claim. They did indeed help by advising Randi to reply. In anemail sent on February 6, 2000 he told me that the tests he referred to were notdone at the JREF, but took place “years ago” and were “informal.” They involvedtwo dogs belonging to a friend of his that he observed over a two-week period.All records had been lost. He wrote: “I overstated my case for doubting thereality of dog ESP based on the small amount of data I obtained. It was rash andimproper of me to do so.”Randi also claimed to have debunked one of my experiments with the dog Jaytee, apart of which was shown on television. Jaytee went to the window to wait for hisowner when she set off to come home, but did not do so before she set off. InDog World, Randi stated: “Viewing the entire tape, we see that the dog respondedto every car that drove by, and to every person who walked by.” This is simplynot true, and Randi now admits that he has never seen the tape.25[32_endnote-title.html#c8e25]Randi often publicizes his “challenge” to psychics, in which he offers to pay $1million for any convincing demonstration of psychic ability under controlledconditions. The problem with this test is that Randi himself acts as policeman,judge, and jury. Given his countless disparaging and insulting remarksconcerning parapsychology, and his financial stake in the debunking movement, hecan hardly be considered an unbiased observer. It is also Randi who decides whowill be tested, and he has explicitly refused to test at least one challenger:homeopath John Benneth. Randi also backed down from a challenge issued by Dr.Jule Eisenbud, who wagered $10,000 that Randi could not duplicate the “thoughtphotography” of Ted Serios, even with the aid of a prop in which a gimmick couldbe housed.26 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e26] More typically, Randi simply ignoreschallenges, such as the challenge to test English psychic Chris Robinson live ontelevision.Occasionally, Randi will appear to agree to a serious test. Dick Bierman, apsychologist at the University of Amsterdam with a Ph.D. in experimentalphysics, has published extensively in the fields of experimental physics,psychology, and parapsychology for over a quarter of a century. Bierman took upRandi’s challenge with an offer for an experiment testing a form of precognitionknown as presentiment, to which Randi responded:Dr. Bierman:I’ve received and read your response. Thank you. I’ve turned this over to mycolleague, Andrew Harter, for first viewing, and it will eventually go toseveral other persons who will give me their learned opinions. That should nottake very long. . . . I will stay in touch with you as we consider yourproposal.Sincerely,James RandiBierman described what happened next:Basically this was followed by a few other irrelevant mails between me and Randiand then I never heard anything on my proposal again.27[32_endnote-title.html#c8e27]Randi also insists on a “preliminary test” before the real test, and he hasnever let anyone past the preliminary stage. This means that Randi’s “challenge”is really nothing but a publicity stunt. Even psychologist Ray Hyman, a Fellowof CSI/CSICOP, has pointed out that this “prize” cannot be taken seriously froma scientific point of view: “Scientists don’t settle issues with a single test,so even if someone does win a big cash prize in a demonstration, this isn’tgoing to convince anyone. Proof in science happens through replication, notthrough single experiments.”28 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e28]With regard to his “challenge” Randi has been quoted as saying, “I always havean out.”29 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e29] However, because of his many outrageousremarks, Randi has been the target of several expensive lawsuits, and in May1991 Randi resigned from CSICOP in order to prevent it from being named as adefendant in subsequent suits.This concludes our review of the experimental evidence. So where are we now?Former member of CSICOP Marcello Truzzi summed up the history of laboratoryparapsychology:As proponents of anomalies produce stronger evidence, critics have sometimesmoved the goal posts further away. . . . To convince scientists of what hadmerely been supported by widespread but weak anecdotal evidence,parapsychologists moved psychical research into the laboratory. Whenexperimental results were presented, designs were criticized. When protocolswere improved, a “fraud proof” or “critical experiment” was demanded. When thosewere put forward, replications were demanded. When those were produced, criticsargued that new forms of error might be the cause (such as the “file drawer”error that could result from unpublished negative studies). When meta-analyseswere presented to counter that issue, these were discounted as controversial,and ESP was reduced to being some present but unspecified “error some place” inthe form of what Ray Hyman called the “dirty test tube argument” (claiming dirtwas in the tube making the seeming psi result a mere artifact). And in oneinstance, when the scoffer found no counter-explanations, he described theresult as a “mere anomaly” not to be taken seriously so just belonging on apuzzle page. The goal posts have now been moved into a zone where some criticshold unfalsifiable positions.30 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e30]Susan Blackmore seems to have retreated into this zone, at least as recently as1995:I am skeptical because believing in psi does not get me anywhere. . . . I am notwaiting for even stronger evidence that psi exists. I am waiting for the psihypothesis to reach the point at which it does more scientific work thanrejecting it. I do not think that point has been reached, and accordingly I amhappy to call myself a skeptic about psi.31 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e31]In other words, Blackmore can continue to call herself a skeptic, regardless ofwhat evidence the researchers present, because in response she can always claimthat “believing in psi does not get me anywhere.” This trivialization of thereality of psi is startling, coming as it is from someone who claims to havespent the past thirty years searching for hard evidence of psi. It will seemeven more startling when we see later that the reality of psi has implicationsfor everything from physics to philosophy.CONCLUDING REMARKSThis is not the first time in history that psychic researchers finally seemed tohave established a solid case for the reality of psi. Back in 1955, Dr. GeorgePrice, then a research associate at the Department of Medicine at the Universityof Minnesota, published an article in the prestigious journal Science thatbegan:Believers in psychic phenomena . . . appear to have won a decisive victory andvirtually silenced opposition. . . . This victory is the result of carefulexperimentation and intelligent argumentation. Dozens of experimenters haveobtained positive results in ESP experiments, and the mathematical procedureshave been approved by leading statisticians. . . . Against all this evidence,almost the only defense remaining to the skeptical scientist is ignorance.32[32_endnote-title.html#c8e32]But Price then argued “ESP is incompatible with current scientific theory” andasked:If, then, parapsychology and modern science are incompatible, why not rejectparapsychology? . . . The choice is between believing in something “trulyrevolutionary” and “radically contradictory to contemporary thought” andbelieving in the occurrence of fraud and self-delusion. Which is morereasonable?33 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e33]More than forty years later, archskeptic Ray Hyman has run out of plausiblecounterexplanations for the results of the latest sets of nowautomatedexperiments, yet he remains undiscouraged. Commenting on the report written bystatistician Jessica Utts, he writes:If Utts’s conclusion is correct, then the fundamental principles that have sosuccessfully guided the progress of science from the days of Galileo and Newtonto the present must be drastically revised. Neither relativity theory norquantum mechanics in their present versions can cope with a world that harborsthe psychic phenomena so boldly proclaimed by Utts and her parapsychologicalcolleagues.34 [32_endnote-title.html#c8e34]In the next section of the book we deal with this, the most fundamental of allthe skeptical objections."},{"pageContent":"QUESTION IIWould the Existence of Psi Contradict Established Science?Say this about assertions that aliens have been, are or will soon be landing onEarth: at least a scenario like that of Independence Day would not violate anylaws of nature. In contrast, claims in other fringe realms, such as telepathyand psychokinesis, are credible only if you ignore a couple or three centuriesof established science.SHARON BEGELY, “SCIENCE ON THE FRINGE,”NEWSWEEK, JULY 1996Psychologists, much more than physicists and biologists, are apt to cherish thedelusion that science has reached the point where it can perfectly delimitbetween the possible and the impossible, that its principles and final conceptshave been perfectly and fully ascertained. Science has been in our own time achanging panorama, continually enlarging the circle to introduce facts formerlyregarded impossible, tearing down old and erecting new theories and alteringsome of its very foundation principles.WALTER FRANKLIN PRINCE, “IS PSYCHIC RESEARCH WORTH WHILE?” 1927Scientism is a psychological process of taking the currently accepted scientifictheories about how the universe functions and subtly starting to regard them asif they were the absolute truth, beyond any further serious questioning. Atheory, always subject to further test and refinement, becomes a law. Thus theprocess of science becomes an “ ism,” becomes a psychological stopping point,becomes a dogmatic belief system, like many of our most dogmatic religions.CHARLES TART,FOREWORD TO MINDSIGHT, 1999"},{"pageContent":"NINEThe Roots of DisbeliefRemarks such as the one from Sharon Begely’s article, cited above, are common inthe skeptical literature. Such remarks are based on the assumption that theexistence of psi phenomena is somehow incompatible with fundamental,well-established scientific principles. So no matter what evidence theparapsychologists produce, the skeptics stoically maintain their denial anddoggedly search for any possible counterexplanation. As we have seen, Ray Hymanhas simply run out of plausible counterexplanations, yet he refuses to acceptthe latest results from a long line of experiments as conclusive. He seemed toconsider himself the spokesperson for mainstream scientists when he wrote in theSkeptical Inquirer: “What seems clear is that the scientific community is notgoing to abandon its fundamental ideas about causality, time and otherprinciples on the basis of a handful of experimentsa [38_notes.html#nine1] whosefindings have yet to be shown to be replicable and lawful.”1[32_endnote-title.html#c9e1]Although surveys consistently show that most people either accept the reality ofESP or have had psychic experiences themselves, remarks such as this in theskeptical literature can give one the impression that all such phenomena are“scientifically impossible.”But many mainstream scientists do not hold this opinion. Two surveys of overfive hundred scientists in one case and over a thousand in another were made inthe 1970s. Both surveys found that the majority of respondents considered ESP“an established fact” or “a likely possibility”: 56 percent in one and 67percent in the other.2 [32_endnote-title.html#c9e2]b [38_notes.html#nine2] Yetif most scientists are open to the possibility of psi, how can we account forthe following story?Robert Jahn was dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science atPrinceton University and a noted authority on aerospace engineering with a longrecord of work for NASA and the Department of Defense when he decided thatcertain parapsychological problems were worth investigating. Did his colleaguesapplaud his pioneering spirit? Not exactly. They as much as said he was crazyand a disgrace to science and the university. The university even convened an adhoc committee to oversee his research— something unheard of for a scientist ofhis stature.3 [32_endnote-title.html#c9e3]And yet not all scientists reacted this way, as Jahn pointed out in a 1983address to the Parapsychology Association. Referring to his PrincetonEngineering Anomalies Research program, he said, “We have had commentary on ourprogram from no less than six Nobel laureates, two of whom categorically rejectthe topic, two of whom encouraged us to push on, and two of whom werecategorically evasive. So much for unanimity of high scientific opinion.”4[32_endnote-title.html#c9e4]However, despite the willingness of many scientists to express favorableopinions toward psi research, parapsychology courses are not routinely taught atuniversities; there are only two labs conducting full-time psi research in theUnited States, and only a handful of such labs in the entire world. Oneexplanation for this (and for Robert Jahn’s experience) is that skepticalopinions of psi seem more common among the administrative elite than amongordinary working scientists. Sociologist Dr. James McClenon surveyed the counciland selected section committees of the American Association for the Advancementof Science (AAAS) in 1981.5 [32_endnote-title.html#c9e5] He found that thesescientists were more skeptical of ESP than scientists in general, with justunder 30 percent believing that ESP was “an established fact” or “a likelypossibility.” Surveyed members in the social sciences (where parapsychologycourses would normally be categorized) were even more skeptical (20 percentbelievers) than those in the natural sciences (30 percent believers). Worriedabout the reputations of their schools and labs, administrators seem far morereluctant to express favorable opinions of psi research than ordinary workingscientists.The skepticism of those who run the scientific establishment is surely onereason why, throughout its history, the resources devoted to psi research havebeen extremely meager. Psychologist Sybo Schouten compared the funding directedtoward parapsychology over the one hundred years spanning 1882 to 1982 and foundthat it was approximately equal to the expenditures of two months ofconventional psychological research in the United States in 1983.6[32_endnote-title.html#c9e6] The other reason funding is difficult to come by isthat many private and public funding agencies have no wish to be associated withwhat the skeptics call “pseudoscience.” Is it any wonder they feel this way? Notwhen scientific journals continue to publish hostile attacks on the scientificvalidity of parapsychology. For instance, the prominent journal Nature publishedthe following in a commentary by skeptical psychologist David Marks:Parascience has all the qualities of a magical system while wearing the mantleof science. Until any significant discoveries are made, science can justifiablyignore it, but it is important to say why: parascience is a pseudo-scientificsystem of untested beliefs steeped in illusion, error, and fraud.7[32_endnote-title.html#c9e7]Clearly then, many scientists find the claims of parapsychology disturbing. Theexistence of psi implies that the minds of people can sometimes communicate,perceive events, and influence objects without the use of the five ordinarysenses or their limbs. Science in its present state cannot explain thesephenomena. This, in itself, should not be a problem: there are plenty of otherphenomena that science cannot currently explain, such as consciousness, theplacebo effect, and the fact that the expansion of the universe appears to beaccelerating. But is the existence of psi in conflict with well-establishedscientific principles?EINSTEIN’S OPINIONIn 1946 parapsychologist Dr. Jan Ehrenwald sent Albert Einstein a copy of a bookhe had recently written called Telepathy and Medical Psychology, asking Einsteinif he would read it and perhaps write an introduction. This was his response:8 July 1946Dear Mr. Ehrenwald:I have read your book with great interest. It doubtlessly represents a good wayof placing your topic in a contemporary context, and I have no doubt that itwill reach a wide circle of readers. I can judge it merely as a layman, andcannot say that I have arrived at either an affirmative or negative conclusion.It seems to me, at any rate, that we have no right, from a physical standpoint,to deny a priori the possibility of telepathy. For that sort of denial thefoundations of our science are too unsure and too incomplete.My impressions concerning the quantitative approach to experiments with cards,and so on, is the following. On the one hand, I have no objection to themethod’s reliability. But I find it suspicious that “clairvoyance” [tests] yieldthe same probabilities as “telepathy,” and that the distance of the subject fromthe cards or from the “sender” has no influence on the result. This is, apriori, improbable to the highest degree, consequently the result is doubtful.Most interesting, and actually of greater interest to me, are the experimentswith the mentally retarded nine-year-old girl and the tests by Gilbert Murray.The drawing results seem to me to have more weight than the large scalestatistical experiments where the discovery of a small methodological error mayupset everything.I find important your observations that a patient’s productivity inpsychoanalytic treatment is clearly influenced by the analyst’s “school.” Thisportion of your book alone is worth careful attention. I cannot fail to notethat some of the experiences you mention arouse the reader’s suspicion thatunconscious influences along sensory channels, rather than telepathicinfluences, may be at work.At any rate, your book has been very stimulating for me, and it has somewhatsoftened my originally quite negative attitude toward the whole of this complexof questions. One should not walk through the world wearing blinders.I cannot write an introduction, as I am quite incompetent to do so. It should beprovided by an experienced psychologist. You may show this letter privately toothers.Respectfully yours,[signed] A. Einstein8 [32_endnote-title.html#c9e8]Einstein’s main problem with reports of telepathy was that the reported effectdid not seem to decline with distance. All of the four known forces ofnature—gravity, electromagnetism, the strong, and the weak nuclearforces—diminish in strength as they radiate from a source. The famousparapsychologist J. B. Rhine considered this proof that psi phenomena operateentirely outside the bounds of known physical laws.However, the laws of physics have been rewritten several times in just the lastcentury. This continual modification of the scientific worldview is calledprogress. Einstein was profoundly uncomfortable with many of the claims ofquantum physics that are now commonly accepted. However, a number of leadingphysicists, such as Henry Margenau, David Bohm, and Olivier Costa de Beauregard,have repeatedly claimed that nothing in quantum mechanics forbids psi phenomena.Costa de Beauregard even maintains that the theory of quantum physics virtuallydemands that psi phenomena exist.9 [32_endnote-title.html#c9e9] Nobel laureateBrian Josephson has stated that some of the most convincing evidence he has seenfor the existence of psi phenomena comes not from the experiments ofparapsychologists but rather from experiments in quantum physics.10[32_endnote-title.html#c9e10]"},{"pageContent":"TENModern Science versus Classical ScienceA serious problem has arisen. Most of the fundamental assumptions underlyingclassical science have been severely challenged in recent years. As the oldassumptions dissolve because of advancements in many disciplines, newassumptions are carrying us toward a conception of the world that is entirelycompatible with psi. Few scientists have paid attention to this dramatic shiftin scientific fundamentals, and the general public has heard almost nothingabout it. . . . Thus, the persistent controversy over psi can be traced back tothe founding assumptions of modern science.DEAN RADIN, THE CONSCIOUS UNIVERSEMany of the skeptical arguments are based on the assumptions that currentscientific theories are complete and that they are in conflict with theexistence of psi. The former is laughable to anyone familiar with the history ofscience. Until about one hundred years ago, Newtonian physics was assumed to becorrect and complete, and was based upon the metaphysical assumptions oflocalism, determinism, the assumption that an observer did not affect a systembeing observed, and on an absolute view of space and time. Then two new theoriesreplaced Newtonian physics. Quantum mechanics did so by abandoning the firstthree assumptions while retaining the fourth, and Einstein’s theory ofrelativity did so by abandoning the fourth while retaining the first three.Because relativity retained most of the assumptions of classical physics whileintroducing a new conception of space and time, it is considered to be thecrowning achievement of classical physics.The predictions of quantum mechanics differ from those of Newtonian physicsprimarily but not entirely at the level of the molecule and below. Relativitydiffers from Newtonian physics most noticeably on the scale of the very largeand the very fast—it is a theory of space, time, and gravity, so most of itspredictions are corroborated by astronomical observations. Yet the theories areinconsistent: relativity breaks down at the atomic level, and quantum mechanicscannot accommodate relativity’s assumptions regarding space and time. Eachtheory is incomplete and limited.It is thought that the reason the theories conflict is because each retained andabandoned different assumptions from Newtonian physics. Some or all of theseassumptions must be either wrong or incomplete, and if a unified theory ofphysics is someday developed, then quantum mechanics and relativity will both beconsidered special cases of the unified theory.a [38_notes.html#ten1]Let us now examine the assumptions of classical science, assumptions that seemto be in conflict with the existence of psi. * Determinism—the idea that the future states of isolated systems can be predicted precisely (at least in principle) from current states. * Observer independence—the assumption that the act of observing a system or particle does not alter the behavior or characteristics of the system or particle. * Localism—the assumption that everything interacts only with its closest neighbors and that, therefore, there is no action at a distance. * Reductionism—the idea that complex systems can be explained as the sum of their parts. * Upward causation exclusively—related to the idea of reductionism, this idea asserts that causation only flows upward, from the simpler to the more complex. * Materialism—the idea that everything in the universe can ultimately be explained in terms of the fundamental particles and the four forces of physics.DETERMINISM AND THE ROLE OF THE OBSERVERQuantum mechanics replaces the deterministic universe described by classicalphysics with a probabilistic universe. This is the idea that the behavior andvarious properties of subatomic systems and particles cannot be predictedprecisely, that only a range of probable values can be specified. If you roll aseries of marbles at a hill, at velocities below a certain critical velocity,all the marbles will roll back down; at velocities above the critical level, allthe marbles will make it over the hill. In our classical macroscopic world,either they all get over or they all fall back. Things are not so simple at thequantum level.b [38_notes.html#ten2]For instance, if subatomic particles, such as electrons, are fired at apotential barrier at a given velocity, it may not be possible to say withcertainty whether or not an individual electron will pass through the barrier.Fire the electrons at a low enough velocity and most will be reflected, althougha minority will pass through; fire them at a high enough velocity and most willpass through; and at some intermediate velocity about half will pass through andhalf will be reflected. But for any individual electron (out of a group ofapparently identical electrons) all we can specify is the probability that theelectron will pass through. And probability enters here for a different reasonthan it does in the tossing of a coin, the throw of a dice, or a horse race: inthese cases probability enters because of our lack of precise knowledge of theoriginal state of the system. But in quantum theory, even if we had completeknowledge of the original state, the outcome would still be uncertain and onlyexpressible as a probability. (Philosophers refer to these two sources ofuncertainty as subjective and objective probability. Quantum mechanics suggeststhat in some situations probability has an objective status.)Another surprising proposition is that subatomic particles do not have definiteproperties for certain attributes, such as position, momentum, or direction ofspin, until they are measured. It is not simply that these properties areunknown until they are observed; they do not exist in any definite state untilthey are measured.This conclusion is based, in part, on the famous “two-slit” experiment, in whichelectrons are fired one at a time at a barrier with two slits. Measuring deviceson a screen behind the barrier indicate the electrons seem to behave as waves,going through both slits simultaneously, with patterns of interference typicalof wave phenomena: wave crests arriving simultaneously at the same place in timewill reinforce each other; waves and troughs arriving simultaneously at the sameplace will cancel each other. These waves are only thought of as probabilitywaves—or “wave functions”—as they do not carry any energy and so cannot bedirectly detected. Only individual electrons are detected by the measuringdevice on the screen behind the barrier, but the distribution of numerouselectrons shows the interference patterns typical of waves. It is as though eachunobserved electron exists as a wave until it arrives at the screen to bedetected, at which time its actual location (the place the particle is actuallyobserved on the screen) can only be predicted statistically, according to theinterference pattern of its wave function.If, however, a measuring device is placed at the slits, then each electron isobserved to pass through only one slit, and no interference pattern in thedistribution of electrons is observed. In other words, electrons behave as waveswhen not observed, but as particles in a definite location when observed.c[38_notes.html#ten3] All quantum entities—electrons, protons, photons, and soon—display this wave-particle duality, behaving as wave or particle, dependingon whether or not they are directly observed.A variation of this experiment, conducted by physicists Bruce Rosenblum and FredKuttner,1 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e1] makes this bizarre point even moreclearly. If a wave corresponding to a single atom encounters a semitransparentreflecting surface (such as a thin film), it can be split into two equal parts,much as a light wave goes through and reflects from a windowpane. One part thenreflects from a fully reflecting surface, and the two parts of the wave canfinally be trapped in two boxes, as in figure 10.1[21_chapter-title-10.html#fig101].image [images/image155-00.jpg]Figure 10.1. The wave function at three successive times: t1, t2, and t3Since the wave was split equally, if you repeated this process many times, theneach time you looked into the boxes you would find a whole atom in Box A abouthalf the time and in Box B about half the time. But, according to quantumtheory, before you looked, the atom was not in any particular box. The positionof the atom is thus an observer-created reality. Its position will also be thesame for all subsequent observers, so it is an observer-created reality, not anobserver-dependent reality.It may be tempting to think that the atom really was in one box or the otherbefore it was observed there, but, in fact, it can be demonstrated that, beforeobservation, the atom as a wave was in a “superposition state,” a state in whichit was simultaneously in both Box A and Box B. Take a pair of boxes that havenot been looked into and cut narrow slits at one end, allowing the waves tosimultaneously leak out and impinge on a photographic film, as shown in figure10.2 [21_chapter-title-10.html#fig102]. At points where wave crests from Box Aand Box B arrive together, they reinforce each other to give a maximum in theamplitude of the wave function at that point—a maximum of “waviness.” At somepoints higher or lower, crests from Box A arrive simultaneously with troughsfrom Box B. The two waves are of opposite signs at these positions and thereforecancel each other out to give zero amplitude for the wave function at thesepoints.Since the amplitude of an atom’s wave function at a particular place determinesthe probability for the atom to be found there when observed, the atom emergingfrom the box-pair is more likely to appear on the film at places where theamplitude of the wave function is large, but it can never appear where it iszero. If we repeat this process with a large number of box-pairs and the samefilm, many atoms land, causing the film to darken near positions of wavefunction amplitude maxima, but none appear at wave function minima. Thedistribution of darker and lighter areas on the film forms the “interferencepattern.”d [38_notes.html#ten4]image [images/image156-00.jpg]Figure 10.2. Waves emanating from slits in the two boxes travel distances dA anddB and impinge upon a film at F (a). The resulting pattern formed on the film byatoms from many box pairs (b).The distribution of electrons on the film will show the interference patternstypical of two waves, which overlap to cancel each other out at some places. Toform the interference pattern, the wave function of each atom had to leak out ofboth boxes, since each and every atom avoids appearing in regions of the filmwhere the waves from the two boxes cancel out each other. Each and every atomtherefore had to obey a geometrical rule that depends on the relative positionof both boxes. So, the argument goes, the atom had to equally be in both boxes,as an extended wave. But if instead of doing this interference experiment youlooked into the pair of boxes, you would have found a whole atom in a particularbox, as a particle. Before you look it is in both boxes; after you look it isonly in one.Rosenblum and Kuttner sum up the puzzle:Quantum mechanics is the most battle-tested theory in science. Not a singleviolation of its predictions has ever been demonstrated, no matter howpreposterous the predictions might seem. However, anyone concerned with what thetheory means faces a philosophical enigma: the so-called measurement problem, orthe problem of observation. . . . Before you look we could have proven—with aninterference experiment—that each atom was a wave equally in both boxes. Afteryou look it was in a single box. It was thus your observation that created thereality of each atom’s existence in a particular box. Before your observation,only probability existed. But it was not the probability that an actual objectexisted in a particular place (as in the classical shell game)—it was just theprobability of a future observation of such an object, which does not includethe assumption that the object existed there prior to its observation. Thishard-toaccept observer-created reality is the measurement problem in quantummechanics.2 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e2]Up until the moment of measurement, certain properties of quantum phenomenasimply exist as a collection of probabilities, known as the state vector, orwave function. The wave function can be thought of as the probabilitydistribution of all possible states, such as, for instance, the probabilitydistribution of all possible locations for an electron.e [38_notes.html#ten5]But this is not the probability that the electron is actually at certainlocations: it is the probability that the electron will be found at certainlocations. The electron does not have a definite location until it is observed.Upon measurement this collection of all possible locations “collapses” to asingle value—the location of the particle that is actually observed. In general,upon measurement, the wave function that contains all possible states for theproperty in question “collapses” to a single value—the one that is observed.Measurements thus play a more positive role in quantum mechanics than inclassical physics, because here they are not merely observations of somethingalready present but actually help produce it. According to one interpretation ofquantum mechanics popular among many theorists, it is the existence ofconsciousness that introduces intrinsic probability into the quantum world.This interpretation owes its origin to mathematician John von Neumann, one ofthe most important intellectual figures of the twentieth century. In addition tohis contributions to pure mathematics, von Neumann invented game theory to modeleconomic and social behavior as rational games, and he made fundamentalcontributions to the development of the early computers. In the 1930s, vonNeumann turned his restless mind to the task of expressing the newly developedtheories of quantum mechanics in rigorous mathematical form, and the result washis classic book, The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. In it hetackled the “measurement problem” head on and rejected the so-called Copenhageninterpretation of quantum theory that was becoming the orthodox position amongphysicists (and arguably, still is). Although somewhat vague, the central tenetsof the Copenhagen interpretation seem to be: (1) that all we have access to arethe results of observations, and so it is simply pointless to ask questionsabout the quantum reality behind those observations, and (2) that althoughobservation is necessary for establishing the reality of quantum phenomena, noform of consciousness, human or otherwise, is necessary for making anobservation. Rather, an observer is anything that makes a record of an event,and so it is at the level of macroscopic measuring instruments (such as Geigercounters) that the actual values of quantum phenomena are randomly set from arange of statistical possibilities.f [38_notes.html#ten6]Von Neumann objected to the Copenhagen practice of dividing the world in twoparts: indefinite quantum entities on the one side, and measuring instrumentsthat obey the laws of classical mechanics on the other. He considered ameasuring apparatus—a Geiger counter, for example—in a room isolated from therest of the world, but in contact with a quantum system, such as an atomsimultaneously in two boxes. The Geiger counter is set to fire if the atom isfound in one box, but to remain unfired if it is found in the other. This Geigercounter is a physical instrument, hence subject to the rules of quantummechanics. Therefore, it should be expected to enter into a superposition statealong with the atom: a state in which it is simultaneously fired and unfired.Should the Geiger counter be in contact with a device that records whether ornot the counter has fired, then, logically, it too should enter a superpositionstate that records both situations as existing simultaneously. Should anobserver walk into the room and examine the recording device, this logic can becontinued up the so-called von Neumann chain: from the recording device tophotons to the eyes and brain of the observer, which are also physicalinstruments that we have no reason to suppose are exempt from the rules ofquantum mechanics. The only peculiar link in the von Neumann chain is theprocess by which electrical signals in the brain of the observer become aconscious experience.Von Neumann argued that the entire physical world is quantum mechanical, so theprocess that collapses the state vectors into actual facts cannot be a physicalprocess: the intervention of something from outside of physics is required toconvert quantum possibilities into actualities. Von Neumann reluctantlyconcluded that this outside entity had to be consciousness, and that prior toobservation, even measuring instruments interacting with a quantum system mustexist in an indefinite state. Physicist Nick Herbert writes:Ironically this conclusion comes not from some otherworldly mystic examining thedepths of his mind in private meditation, but from one of the world’s mostpractical mathematicians deducing the logical consequences of a highlysuccessful and purely materialistic model of the world—the theoretical basis forthe billion-dollar computer industry.3 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e3]g[38_notes.html#ten7]Von Neumann extended the Copenhagen interpretation by requiring the measurementprocess to take place in a mind.h [38_notes.html#ten8] His arguments weredeveloped more completely by his illustrious followers, most notably FritzLondon, Edmond Bauer, and Eugene Wigner. Wigner, who went on to win the NobelPrize in physics, wrote:When the province of physical theory was extended to encompass microscopicphenomena, through the creation of quantum mechanics, the concept ofconsciousness came to the fore again; it was not possible to formulate the lawsof quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to theconsciousness. . . . It will remain remarkable, in whatever way our futureconcepts may develop, that the very study of the external world led to theconclusion that the content of consciousness is an ultimate reality.4[32_endnote-title.html#c10e4]At this point, it should be stressed that this is only one interpretation of thefacts of quantum mechanics: in addition to the Copenhagen interpretation, thereare several other speculations about what is really happening when quantumpossibilities settle down into one actuality. Most attempt to rescue thedeterminism and observer-independence of classical physics.For instance, hidden-variable theory holds that the indeterminacy of quantumphysics is an illusion stemming from our ignorance: if we knew more about thesystem in question—that is, if we knew the value of some “hidden variables”—thenthe indeterminacy would vanish. However, there are several reasons why thegeneral community of quantum physicists never held the hidden-variable theory inhigh regard.One reason, according to quantum physicist Euan Squires, is that thehidden-variable theory is “extremely complicated and messy. We know the answersfrom quantum theory and then we construct a hidden-variable, deterministictheory specifically to give these answers. The resulting theory appearscontrived and unnatural.” Squires points out that the hidden variable theorynever gained widespread acceptance, because “the elegance, simplicity andeconomy of quantum theory contrasted sharply with the contrived nature of ahidden-variable theory which gave no new predictions in return for its increasedcomplexity; the whole hidden-variable enterprise was easily dismissed as arisingfrom a desire, in the minds of those too conservative to accept change, toreturn to the determinism of classical physics.”5 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e5]Another reason the general community of quantum physicists consider thehidden-variable theory highly implausible is that it explains away indeterminacyby postulating the existence of an ad hoc “quantum force” that, unlike any ofthe other four forces in nature, behaves in a manner completely unaffected bydistance.The many-worlds hypothesis is perhaps the strangest of all. It is the only onethat denies the existence of nonlocality, but it does so by postulating that allpossible values of a measured property exist simultaneously in coexistinguniverses. When a measurement is made, we are told that the universe we are insplits into multiple universes, with one of the possible results in each ofthem. For instance, if a measurement may yield two possible results, then at thepoint of measurement the entire universe splits in two, with each possibleresult realized in each universe. If a measurement may yield a continuum ofpossible states—such as the position of an electron—then the instant such ameasurement occurs, it is proposed that the universe splits into an infinity ofuniverses. Since it is further assumed that these parallel universes cannotinteract with each other, this hypothesis is completely untestable. Entities arebeing multiplied with incredible profusion. William of Occam must be spinning inhis grave.In the opinion of many physicists, the last two interpretations are simplydesperate, last-ditch attempts to rescue the classical assumptions ofdeterminism and observer-independence that have been abandoned by quantummechanics. For instance, one interpretation salvages determinism from classicalphysics by postulating hidden variables, and the other by speculating thateverything that can happen does in fact happen in an infinity of constantlysplitting parallel universes—regardless of the way things may appear to anyparticular version of our constantly splitting selves.At any rate, these four interpretations are all consistent with the observedfacts. They are attempts to describe what reality is really like betweenobservations, to account for the seemingly bizarre behavior of matter predictedso accurately by the theory of quantum physics. They are not actually scientifictheories about the nature of reality, but metaphysical theories, as withinquantum mechanics there does not currently seem to be any obvious experimentthat one could perform in order to choose between them.i [38_notes.html#ten9]Physicist J. C. Polkinghorne summed up the metaphysical confusion many quantumtheorists feel when he wrote:It is a curious tale. All over the world measurements are continually being madeon quantum mechanical systems. The theory triumphantly predicts, within itsprobabilistic limits, what their outcomes will be. It is all a great success.Yet we do not understand what is going on. Does the fixity on a particularoccasion set in as a purely mental act of knowledge? At a transition from smallto large physical systems? At the interface of matter and mind that we callconsciousness? In one of the many subsequent worlds into which the universe hasdivided itself?6 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e6]j [38_notes.html#ten10]Perhaps one interpretation is simpler, or more logically consistent, or perhapsone of the interpretations is more aesthetically pleasing than the others. Theseconsiderations may provide philosophical reasons for preferring one over theothers, but they can hardly be considered decisive. However, recall that inchapter 5 [15_chapter-title-5.html] we described how the experiments ofphysicist Helmut Schmidt appeared to show that conscious intent can affect thebehavior of otherwise purely random quantum phenomena. Could a parapsychologyexperiment be designed to test the von Neumann interpretation?Consciousness is central to the von Neumann interpretation of quantum mechanics.According to this interpretation, some properties of quantum phenomena do notexist in any definite state except through the intervention of a conscious mind,at which point the wave function of possibilities collapses into a single state.The usual form of this interpretation allows the observer to collapse the wavefunction to a unique outcome, but not to have any effect on what outcomeactually occurs. But the PK experiments of Schmidt and other physicistsdiscussed earlier indicate that the observer may not only collapse the wavefunction to a single outcome but may also help specify what outcome occurs byshifting the odds in a desired direction. If the observer can affect the outcomeof the collapse, it should be possible to design an experiment to test at whichpoint the wave function collapses.As mentioned earlier, physicist Helmut Schmidt has pioneered the use of PKexperiments using random number generators (RNGs) that operate on the basis oftruly random events at the quantum level. His standard experiments indicate thatindividuals can shift the probability of a binary event from a chance rate of 50percent to between 51 and 52 percent, with a few gifted subjects achieving hitrates of about 54 percent. But one variation of Schmidt’s standard experiment isdirectly relevant to the choice between the von Neumann and the Copenhageninterpretations.First of all, Schmidt recorded signals (0s and 1s) from a binary random eventgenerator simultaneously on two cassette tapes, without anyone listening to thesignals or otherwise knowing the output of the RNG. One tape was kept in asecure location, the other was given to a subject with instructions to producemore 0s or 1s, usually distinguished as clicks in the left or right speaker ofstereophonic headphones. Results from these time-displaced PK experimentsindicated that PK still operated, and that the two records still agreed afterthe PK effort.Some theorists have speculated that the PK effort reached back in time to whenthe random events were generated, but, of course, there is another possibility,one more consistent with the von Neumann/Wigner interpretation of quantumphysics. As Schmidt, Robert Morris, and Luther Rudolph point out:Perhaps events are not physically real until there has been an observation. Fromthis viewpoint, the PK effort would not have to reach into the past becausenature had not yet decided on the outcome before the PK subject, the firstobserver, saw the result. Then, the PK effort should no longer succeed if wehave some other observer look at the prerecorded data previous to the PKsubject’s attempt. [An] experiment to study this situation . . . has, indeed,reported a blocking of the PK effect by a previous observation.7[32_endnote-title.html#c10e7]It appears that von Neumann, Wigner, and the others were right: prior toobservation, even measuring instruments interacting with a quantum system mustexist in an indefinite state.Could Schmidt’s results be due to fraud? Well, Schmidt has even used thistime-independence of PK to design a fraudproof experiment involving skeptics.Essentially, it works like this: one of the unobserved tapes is sent to anoutside observer, and the other is sent to a subject. The outside observerdecides whether she wants to see more 0s or 1s, and this decision iscommunicated to the subject, who then listens to the tape and attempts to exertan influence in the desired direction. The observer then examines her copy ofthe tape and counts the number of 0s and 1s to see if the experiment was asuccess. Obviously, there can be no possibility of fraud on the part of subjector experimenter—unless the skeptics are also in on the trick. Schmidt, Morris,and Rudolph performed this experiment: Morris is an active parapsychologyresearcher and Rudolph is a communications engineer, and both were skepticalwith regard to PK on prerecorded events. But the experiment was a success, withodds against chance of one hundred to one.8 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e8]The von Neumann/Wigner interpretation of quantum physics, supported now by theexperiments of Schmidt and others, may bring to mind the idealism of BishopBerkeley, who thought that ordinary objects, such as trees and furniture, didnot exist unless observed. But this interpretation does not deny that anexternal reality exists independent of anyone observing it. Properties ofquantum phenomena are divided into static and dynamic properties, with theformer, such as mass and charge, having definite and constant values for anyobservation. It is the dynamic properties, those that do not have constantvalues— such as position, momentum, and direction of spin—that are thought toexist as potentialities that become actualities only when observed. But asquantum theorist Euan Squires points out, this raises a very strange question:The assumption we are considering appears even more weird when we realize thatthroughout much of the universe, and indeed throughout all of it in early times,there were presumably no conscious observers. . . . Even worse are the problemswe meet if we accept the modern ideas on the early universe in which quantumdecays (of the ‘vacuum,’ but this need not trouble us here) were necessary inorder to obtain the conditions in which conscious observers could exist. Who, orwhat, did the observations necessary to create the observers?9[32_endnote-title.html#c10e9]Squires enters the realm of theology with great trepidation and considers whatseems to be the only possibility under this interpretation: that consciousobservations can be made by minds outside of the physical universe. This, ofcourse, is one of the traditional roles of God, or of the gods.Whether expressed in theological terms or not, the suggestion that consciousminds are in some way connected and that they might even be connected to a formof universal, collective consciousness appears to be a possible solution to theproblem of quantum theory. It is not easy to see what it might mean, as weunderstand so little about consciousness. That there are “connections” of somesort between conscious minds and physical matter is surely implied by the factthat conscious decisions have effects on matter. Thus there are links betweenconscious minds that go through the medium of physical systems. Whether thereare others, that exploit the nonphysical and presumably nonlocalised nature ofconsciousness, it is not possible to say. Some people might wish to mention herethe “evidence” for telepathy and similar extra-sensory effects.10[32_endnote-title.html#c10e10]k [38_notes.html#ten11]Professor Squires concludes his discussion on the role of consciousness inphysics with this remark:It is remarkable that such ideas should arise from a study of the behavior ofthe most elementary of systems. That such systems point to a world beyondthemselves is a fact that will be loved by all who believe that there are truthsof which we know little, that there are mysteries seen only by mystics, and thatthere are phenomena inexplicable within our normal view of what is possible.There is no harm in this—physics indeed points to the unknown. The emphasis,however, must be on the unknown, on the mystery, on the truths dimly glimpsed,on things inexpressible except in the language of poetry, or religion, ormetaphor.11 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e11]LOCALISMAll interactions in classical physics are explicitly local. Interactions betweena body at Location A and another body at Location B must be mediated by a forcefield that traverses the distance between A and B, at a speed not exceeding thatof light. Body A causes a change in the force field, and this change in thefield is propagated at or below light speed to Body B. So, for instance, thegravitational field of the sun exerts an influence on the earth: if the sun wereto be suddenly destroyed, the orbit of the earth would be affected about eightminutes later.Localism implies that any information exchange must be mediated by a signal, andrelativity implies that no such signal can travel faster than the speed oflight. But experiments in quantum mechanics strongly suggest that we can, infact, have action at a distance, with no signal required to transmitinformation.This is one such experiment. Suppose a pair of electrons is split off from anatom. Quantum physics tells us that when the spin of the electrons is measuredalong a chosen axis, they will be found to spin in opposite directions. Thisdoes not mean that they started off spinning in opposite directions: directionof spin is a dynamic property, and according to quantum theory dynamicproperties do not exist with any definite value until they are measured. Theelectrons are in a state of opposite direction of spin, but both are without anyparticular direction of spin until the spin of one is measured.Let the electrons travel light-years apart and measure the spin of one. If it isfound to be clockwise, then, according to quantum theory, the spin of the otheris instantaneously determined to be in the opposite direction, despite noapparent force or signal linking them. Einstein called this “spooky action at adistance” and rejected it on the grounds that there could be no harmony withoutsome signal passing between the distant particles, a signal that, in this case,would have to travel faster than the speed of light, which his theory ofrelativity did not allow.For years, Albert Einstein and the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr argued overwhether the adjustment was, in reality, truly instantaneous. Most physicistsconsidered the disagreement purely philosophical, as no one knew how thenonlocality implied by quantum theory could be tested. Then, in 1964,mathematical physicist John Bell derived a theorem—later known as “Bell’sTheorem”—which could be used to test whether or not the universe was trulynonlocal. These experiments are difficult to conduct with sufficient accuracy,but a series of experiments, beginning in the early 1970s, supportednonlocality. With progress in technology, more sophisticated experiments havebecome possible, usually using photons instead of electrons, and measuringpolarization (direction of vibration of the electric field—totally polarizedwhen its electric field vibrates in only one direction) instead of spin. In the1980s, a French team headed by Alain Aspect of the Institut d’Optique Theoriqueet Appliqué added to Bohm’s experiment an ultrafast switch to eliminate thepossibility of any light-speed signal between the paired photons, and found thenonlocal prediction of quantum mechanics to hold.12[32_endnote-title.html#c10e12] Since then, several other experiments haveprovided overwhelming evidence of the reality of nonlocal influences and haveeven demonstrated nonlocality over distances of sixteen kilometers (tenmiles).13 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e13]l [38_notes.html#ten12] David Bohm hascommented:All we can do is to look at several possible interpretations. . . . It may meanthat everything in the universe is in a kind of total rapport, so that whateverhappens is related to everything else. Or it may mean that there is some kind ofinformation that can travel faster than the speed of light. Or it may mean thatour concepts of space and time have to be modified in some way that we don’t nowunderstand.14 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e14]As Bohm remarks, there are several possible interpretations, but nonlocalityappears to be an experimentally demonstrated fact.15[32_endnote-title.html#c10e15] It is these sorts of experiments that haveprovided Nobel laureate Brian Josephson with some of the most convincingevidence he has seen for the reality of psi. And it overcomes Einstein’sobjection that since the observed effects of telepathy do not seem to declinewith distance, the phenomenon is therefore “a priori, improbable to the highestdegree.”Several points about nonlocality are worth noting. First of all, nonlocalitydoes not seem to violate special relativity’s prohibition of fasterthan-lightsignals, as no signals are sent. The four known forces of nature are thought tooperate with the exchange of particles, all of which obey the cosmic speedlimit.m [38_notes.html#ten13] But in the case above, a change in the state at A(due to measurement) instantaneously causes a change at B, regardless ofdistance or barriers. Since no signal is sent through space, the quantumconnection is immediate and unaffected by barriers and distance. Anotherimportant point is that nonlocality appears to have been established byarithmetic and experiment, and it is thus a fact about the universe, independentof quantum mechanical theory.n [38_notes.html#ten14] So any theory thateventually supersedes quantum mechanics will have to incorporate nonlocality.Finally, it is worth noting that the quantum connection differs from ordinaryforces in that it is very discriminating. Ordinary forces reach out and affectevery particle of a certain kind in the immediate vicin-ity; for instance,gravity affects all particles, electromagnetism all charged particles. Bycontrast, the quantum connection only affects those systems that have interactedwith each other since they were last measured. (Such systems are called“phase-entangled.”) This brings to mind the discriminating nature of telepathyfound in anecdotal reports and observed in the lab: images are not sent at orreceived by everyone but seem targeted at specific individuals.So could telepathy be an example of quantum nonlocality? The answer would seemto depend upon whether or not the brain operates according to quantum mechanicalprinciples. Scientists and philosophers intent on clinging to classical conceptsusually argue at this point that quantum effects are normally observed onlyunder certain strictly controlled conditions, that quantum effects will be wipedout in warm wet brains, and, hence, classical physics is completely adequate fordealing with the relationship between thoughts and brain activity.According to Berkeley physicist Henry Stapp, “That argument is incorrect.”Quantum effects at the large scale are often difficult to observe in practice.This fact allows certain computations to be simplified in practice by treating aquantum system as if it were a classical one. But according to Stapp, if no trueclassical reality emerges at any macroscopic scale, “then the investigation ofan issue as basic as the nature of the mind-brain connection ought in principleto be pursued within an exact framework, rather than crippling the investigationfrom the outset by replacing correct principles by concepts known to befundamentally and grossly false, just because they allow certain practicalcomputations to be simplified.”16 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e16]So, theoretical rigor requires us to investigate the theoretical problem of themind-brain relationship within the much more accurate framework of quantumphysics. But there is also some empirical evidence that sheds light on therelationship between quantum principles and consciousness. AnesthesiologistStuart Hameroff claims to have found evidence that anesthesia arrestsconsciousness by hindering the motion of electrons in microtubules, minutetunnels of protein that serve as a kind of skeleton for cells. Hameroffspeculates that microtubules could be a possible site for quantum effects in thebrain,17 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e17] and his speculations have ledmathematical physicist Roger Penrose to endorse the hypothesis.18[32_endnote-title.html#c10e18] Attempts to develop models of consciousness basedon quantum mechanics have also been made by neuroscientist John Eccles, andphysicists Henry Stapp and Evan Harris Walker.o [38_notes.html#ten15] Walker andthe experimental physicist Helmut Schmidt (the latter responsible for many ofthe micro-PK experiments described earlier) have also proposed mathematicaltheories of psi based on quantum mechanics.19 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e19]These theories rest upon two propositions that are now supported by experimentalevidence: that mind can influence random quantum events, and that influence canoccur instantaneously at a distance.p [38_notes.html#ten16]If consciousness exploits quantum mechanical principles, and if, as experimentsindicate, reality is truly nonlocal, then our experience of psi may be ourexperience of the connectedness of nature that nonlocality suggests: nonlocalityat the macroscopic level. This is highly speculative, of course, but both theanecdotal and experimental evidence for psi is consistent with the nonlocaleffects of quantum physics.20 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e20]REDUCTIONISMScience generally—and, in particular, all of classical physics—is highlyreductionist, in that it seeks to explain objects and systems in terms of theirparts. Scientists attempt to take entities apart and to explain them in terms ofsmaller, simpler, localized entities. So, for instance, organisms are understoodas composed of tissues and organs, which are in turn understood as collectionsof cells, cells are composed of molecules, which are composed of atoms composedof subatomic particles, and so forth. This method of reduction is a powerfulform of analysis, and it has led to many very successful explanations. Molecularbiology has proved to be an extraordinarily powerful approach to understandingevolution, heredity, and other aspects of life. Quantum mechanics, the study ofthe smallest scale of reality, has provided insights into the life and death ofstars, and the origin of the universe.However, the successes of reductionist methods have sometimes led to claims thatbiology is really nothing but applied cell biology, cell biology is reallynothing but applied molecular biology, which in turn is just chemistry, thatchemistry is really just applied many-body physics, and that ultimately,everything can be explained by the laws of quantum mechanics. So, for instance,in his book Of Molecules and Men we have molecular biologist andüber-reductionist Francis Crick writing, “The ultimate aim of the modernmovement in biology is to explain all biology in terms of physics andchemistry.”It was irritation with claims like this that led Phillip Anderson, acondensed-matter physicist, to write the essay “More Is Different,” published inScience in 1972.21 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e21] Anderson, who went on to winthe Nobel Prize in 1977, acknowledged the many successes of reductionism butthen argued that “the main fallacy with this kind of thinking is that thereductionist hypothesis does not by any means imply a ‘constructionist’ one: theability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply theability to start with those laws and reconstruct the universe.” Reality has ahierarchal structure, Anderson contended, ordered in terms of increasingcomplexity. And at each level of complexity entirely new propertiesunpredictably appear, so that “at each stage entirely new laws, concepts, andgeneralizations are necessary, requiring inspiration and creativity to just asgreat a degree as in the previous one.” Or, in other words, “Psychology is notjust applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry.”As we go up the hierarchy of the sciences, complexity increases, and newproperties emerge at each new level. And it is the existence of these“emergent”—that is, unpredictable, irreducible, and holistic—properties that donot allow us to explain the social sciences in terms of psychology, psychologyin terms of biology, and everything ultimately in terms of quantum mechanics. Asimple example of an emergent property is the fluidity of water, which isnothing like any property of hydrogen and oxygen.q [38_notes.html#ten17] Asanother example, crystals have all sorts of properties, both geometrical andoptical, that the molecules that compose them do not possess. New chemicalproperties can also emerge and replace others: sodium violently explodes when itcomes into contact with water, and chlorine is a deadly poison, but whencombined they form crystals of sodium chloride—table salt.Indeed, it seems as though the entire history of the universe as we know itcould be understood as the emergence of new entities and properties, withincreasing levels of complexity. Heavy atomic nuclei emerged in the center oflarge stars, and later on organic molecules emerged on earth. When organicmolecules were combined in special ways, single-celled life emerged, with allthe new properties of molecular and cell biology. The combination of individualcells into multicellular organisms also resulted in something new: the behaviorof complex animals. When sufficient complexity was attained, something utterlynew and completely different entered the universe: the emergence of consciousstates. Conscious minds interacted with other minds, and in turn emerged theproducts of human minds, such as culture, works of art, and, of course, thescientific studies of all the preceding levels of reality, from quantummechanics to chemistry to biology to psychology, and to the social sciences thatstudy the products of human culture itself. As the celebrated philosopher ofscience Karl Popper often pointed out, the universe is creative.Claims such as “psychology is just applied biology” or “organisms are nothingbut collections of cells” are given the pejorative label of reductionism becausethey are considered to be unwarranted reductions. It is perfectly acceptable andoften very useful to consider an organism as a collection of cells in the samesense that a building can be considered a collection of materials: theproperties of any complex entity are determined largely (but not entirely) bythe properties of its parts. The dispute is with the assertion that thesecomplex entities are nothing but their component parts.The nothing but reductions ignore the new properties that emerge when componentsare combined in special ways. Of course, a complex entity like a building can bereduced to rubble, but this reduction destroys the space-time relationships ofthe building components. Emergent properties result from the parts and from thespacing and timing of the parts with reference to one another, but the laws ofthe components do not include these space-time factors. In other words, it isthe spatiotemporal relationships between the components that make the wholegreater than the simple sum of its parts.And it is important to realize that the properties that emerge at new levels ofcomplexity do not replace the more fundamental properties of the more basiclevels: they are additions, not replacements or even amendments. This has animportant implication for the hierarchy of sciences. For although a less basicscience—for example, chemistry in relation to physics, biology in relation tochemistry—is still an independent science with its own principles, the lessbasic science should not usually make claims that are incompatible withwell-established claims of a science that is more basic relative to it. Shouldclaims be made that appear to be in conflict with the principles of a more basicscience, they must be abandoned, modified, shown to be in conformity with theclaims of the more basic science or—if there is sufficient evidence for theclaims—considered as potential falsifications of the general yet more basicprinciple.Anyway, from what we have seen so far, it would appear that the charge that theclaims of parapsychology are incompatible with those of the more basic sciencesis groundless, as they are not incompatible with quantum mechanics, at this timethe most basic science of all. Given the existence of emergent properties, theoperation of psi in our macroscopic world is consistent with but not necessarilyexplained by quantum mechanical principles.Quantum systems exhibit an unexpected degree of togetherness. Mere spatialseparation does not divide them from each other. It is a particularly surprisingconclusion for so reductionist a subject as physics. After all, elementaryparticle physics is always trying to split things up into smaller and smallerconstituents with a view to treating them independently of each other. I do notthink we have yet succeeded in taking in fully what quantum mechanicalnonlocality implies about the nature of the world.J. C. POLKINGHORNEUPWARD AND DOWNWARD CAUSATIONFrom a purely reductionist standpoint, all causation must flow strictly in anupward direction, from the simpler to the more complex. For if we assume thatpsychology is nothing but applied biology, biology nothing but appliedchemistry, and chemistry nothing but applied physics, then the more complexstructures are nothing more than functions of their substructures, and socausation only flows upward. In this traditional view, the cosmos is physicallydriven from below by the elemental forces of chemistry and physics, andultimately by quantum mechanics.If however, with increasing complexity new phenomena emerge that are to someextent independent of the smaller-scale processes that created them, then theymay be able to exert top-down control over their substructures. This is theconcept of downward causation, which may be said to occur whenever a higherstructure operates upon its substructure. According to this view, due mostly toneuroscientist Roger Sperry and biologist Donald Campbell, causation flowsdownward as well as upward. No one disputes that causation flows upward; thequestion is whether things are determined exclusively from below or whetherdownward causation is also operating.The concept of downward causation may be illustrated within the structuralhierarchy of nature. A simple example is the downward control exerted by amolecule of water over its hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The laws defining thebehavior of the atoms, particularly their course through space and time, becomequite different after they are joined together in a molecule. Although theatomic properties are preserved, the atoms are now obliged to follow a newcourse through space and time, determined by the newly emerged properties of thewater molecule. If the molecule is itself part of a single-celled organism, suchas a paramecium, then it in turn is obliged to follow a new course through spaceand time, determined by the forces driving the cell. If the cell is part of amulticelled organism, such as a cat, then the behavior of the cell is determinedby its purpose in terms of cat physiology, and its fate is determined by thebehavior of the cat, as may be described in terms of feline zoology andpsychology. At all times, the simpler lower-level forces and laws are alloperating: they have not been replaced but superseded by the properties of thehigher-level organizational structures.r [38_notes.html#ten18]A reductionist may agree with this account but may then argue that thehigher-level properties, as, for instance, those of a water molecule, may bepredicted from the atomic properties. But predictability is not the issue here.Being able to predict the emergence of new properties does not make thoseproperties any less real, important, or powerful as causal determinants. Perhapsevolution is in principle entirely predictable, starting with subatomicparticles and forces (although this is extremely doubtful, given the purerandomness of many quantum phenomena), but this does not change the argumentthat evolution does occur, that new properties do emerge, and that these newproperties in turn exert downward causal influence over their constituents,which are thereafter governed by new scientific laws.Extending this discussion of emergent properties and their causal influence upthe hierarchy of nature leads to the suggestion that minds may be able to havecausal influence upon lower-level structures and, ultimately, that human culturemay be able to influence human minds. This brings us to the final assumption ofclassical science, one that is of special relevance to the existence of psiphenomena.MATERIALISMThe final assumption of classical science considered here is materialism. Oftenknown today as physicalism, it asserts that everything in the universe canultimately be explained entirely in terms of the fundamental particles andforces of physics. The cruder forms of materialism simply deny the existence ofmental states, or hold that mental states are identical to brain states.s[38_notes.html#ten19] The more sophisticated forms of materialism considermental states and consciousness as mere epiphenomena of brain activity—that is,as phenomena that accompany brain activity, are caused by brain activity, butare of no real use and carry no explanatory power.This metaphysical hypothesis is the most drastic of the proposed solutions tothe so-called mind/body problem—that is, what is the nature of the relationshipbetween mind and body? After thousands of years of debate, three top contendersfor a solution remain: * Materialism—Mental events have no causal influence, they are simply by-products of physical events in the brain. The mind is a mere epiphenomenon, dependent upon and controlled by a physical brain, and therefore incapable of existing apart from a physical brain. All that matters is matter. * Mentalism—Matter exerts causal influence on mind, but mind also exerts causal influence on matter and has causal primacy. However, mind is an emergent property of physical brains, so the existence of mind ultimately depends on matter. * Dualism—Not only do mind and matter exert causal influence on each other, but both are entirely irreducible phenomena that can exist independent of each other.The most ancient of these beliefs is dualism, found as it is in the oldshamanistic religions around the world. Although the first formal statement ofdualism was by Descartes, one of the earliest written references to dualistthinking may be found in Plato’s description of the last hours of Socrates, inwhich Socrates ridicules the notion that purposeful behavior can be explained inphysical terms. Plato made a sharp distinction between mind and body, holdingthat the mind could exist both before and after its residence in the body andcould rule the body during that residence. An even earlier reference to a formof dualism may be found in a lecture given by Hippocrates on epilepsia(epilepsy), in which the brain is described as “the messenger to consciousness”and as “the interpreter for consciousness.” Modern dualists can count amongtheir ranks several distinguished modern philosophers and brain scientists.t[38_notes.html#ten20]Materialism in all its varieties also has an ancient history, going back atleast as far as Democritus, who back in the fifth century BC wrote that “nothingexists, but atoms and the void.” It had a powerful and influential advocate inthe nineteenth century in the form of Darwin’s close friend Thomas Huxley, whoproposed the thesis that animals and men are automata. Huxley did not deny theexistence of mental events, but he maintained that the relationship between mindand body was strictly one-sided, with the mental having no effect on thephysical. Huxley described mental events as mere epiphenomena, or just uselessby-products of brain activity. So men and animals for him were just automata,even if conscious ones. This is still the position of many philosophers,biologists, and neuroscientists.Materialism was popular in psychology in the 1950s, as part of a movement knownas “behaviorism,” and the doctrine of behaviorism is still adhered to by someneuroscientists and psychologists. But in the 1960s, the concept of mentalismbegan to spread in acceptance among cognitive scientists, mostly due to thewritings of neurobiologist Roger Sperry. Sperry, who won the 1981 Nobel Prize inmedicine for his work on the functions of the two hemispheres of the brain,rightly recognized that the profound mystery of consciousness makes a choicebetween the alternatives difficult:Once we have materialism squared off against mentalism in this way, I think wemust all agree that neither is going to win the match on the basis of direct,factual evidence. The facts do not simply go far enough. Those centermostprocesses of the brain with which consciousness is presumably associated aresimply not understood. They are so far beyond our comprehension at present thatno one I know of has been able even to imagine their nature.22[32_endnote-title.html#c10e22]Apart from the dwindling number of pure materialists who still deny theexistence of consciousness, and the dwindling number of researchers in the fieldof artificial intelligence still trying to raise money for the construction of“thinking machines,”u [38_notes.html#ten21] this position is reflected in thewritings of most serious scientists. Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner writes, “Wehave at present not even the vaguest idea how to connect the physiochemicalprocesses with the state of the mind.”23 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e23]Physicist Nick Herbert concurs:Science’s biggest mystery is the nature of consciousness. It is not simply thatwe possess bad or imperfect theories of human awareness; we simply have no suchtheories at all. About all we know about consciousness is that it has somethingto do with the head, rather than the foot.24 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e24]Materialists sometimes claim to represent the scientific viewpoint. Butmaterialism is in no sense a more “scientific” hypothesis than the alternatives,as it does not draw stronger support from current scientific thinking.Materialism is a legacy of classical physics, which actually had two ways ofdealing with the problem of consciousness and free will. The first, followed byDescartes and Newton, was to place mind outside of the scope of physics andconsider it the sole exception in an otherwise deterministic, mechanisticuniverse. The other approach, followed by popularizers of Newton’s work, such asDiderot and Voltaire, was to assume that the physics of the time was a completedescription of the world, and to argue that consciousness must then beepiphenomenal. But we now know that classical physics is fundamentallyincorrect, and so any worldview based upon it must be flawed. Sperry writes:To conclude that conscious, mental, or psychic, forces have no place in fillingthis gap in our explanatory picture is at least to go well beyond the facts intothe realm of intuition and speculation. The doctrine of materialism inbehavioral science, which tends to be identified with a rigorous scientificapproach, is thus seen to rest, in fact, on an insupportable mental inferencethat goes far beyond the objective evidence and hence is founded on the cardinalsin of science.25 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e25]Our common sense would certainly seem to suggest that mental events such asperceptions, beliefs, emotions, intentions, and so forth all have causaleffects. We normally speak and think as if our thoughts, feelings, and values dodetermine our course of action. And, of course, our moral judgments alsopresuppose that these things have a real impact on human behavior. But commonsense arguments, however seemingly compelling, are not sufficient by themselvesto draw strong conclusions, as on many occasions science has shown common senseto have been dead wrong.What, then, is the argument in favor of the causal efficacy of mental events? Itis simple and straightforward. First, it contends that mind and consciousnessare emergent properties of living brains, and then it goes a critical stepfurther and asserts that these emergent properties have causal potency, just asthey do elsewhere in the universe. In other words, it applies the concepts ofemergent properties and downward causation to mind and consciousness, and toeverything they seem to affect.It is important to stress that the lower-level forces and properties of atoms,molecules, and cells all continue to operate, and all continue to exert upward(and in most cases downward) causal influence. None of these causal forces havebeen canceled or replaced, but they have been superseded by the properties of ahigher organizational structure. According to this new view, mind andconsciousness exert just as much (or even more) causal effect on the lower-levelstructures than the lower-level structures exert on them. Mental events interactwith other mental events at their own level, according to their own rules, andin the process exert downward control over the lower-level structures. Sperry’smodel puts mind back into the driver’s seat, and, accordingly, perceptions,thoughts, beliefs, emotion, judgment, and so forth are recognized as having areal, not just an imaginary, impact on the world.The ultimate paradox of materialism is that the one feature of the universewhich alone gives meaning to all the rest is the one feature which has to bedeclared redundant! Nothing can account for its emergence; nothing follows fromits existence.JOHN BELOFFShortly after Sperry first proposed these ideas in the mid 1960s, thephilosopher Karl Popper seems to have come to an almost identical conclusion,although from a somewhat different perspective. Popper points out that noDarwinist should accept the one-sided action of body on mind proposed by thematerialists. In his books On the Origin of Species and Natural Selection,Darwin discussed the mental powers of animals and men, and argued that these areproducts of natural selection.Now if that is so, then mental powers must assist organisms in their strugglefor survival. And it follows from this that mental powers must exert causalinfluence on the behavior of animals and people. If conscious states exist,then, according to Darwinism, we should look for their uses. If they are usefulfor living, then they must have real effects on the physical world.As mentioned earlier, Darwin’s close friend Thomas Huxley was a thoroughgoingmaterialist. While he did not deny the existence of mental events, he wrote thatthe relationship between mind and body was strictly one-sided, with the mentalhaving no effect on the physical. Since mental events for Huxley were justuseless by-products of brain activity, he thought people and animals were justautomata, with useless consciousness along for the ride.Although Darwin liked and admired Huxley, he would have none of this. SupportingHuxley’s opinion would have contradicted his life’s work, as Popper rightlypoints out:The theory of natural selection constitutes a strong argument against Huxley’stheory of the one-sided action of body on mind and for the mutual interaction ofmind and body. Not only does the body act on the mind—for example, inperception, or in sickness—but our thoughts, our expectations, and our feelingsmay lead to useful actions in the physical world. If Huxley had been right, mindwould be useless. But then it could not have evolved . . . by naturalselection.26 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e26]So from a strictly Darwinian standpoint, the mental powers of animals and humansshould be expected to lead to useful actions and should therefore be a causalinfluence in nature. According to this account, perceptions, emotions,judgments, and thoughts all have a real effect. And the more highly developedthe mental powers, the more causal impact they should be expected to have. Weshould conclude from this that the mental powers of humans exert more causalpotency than that of any other living creatures on earth, as, arguably, we arethe only creatures on earth with ideas and ideals. Sperry writes:In the brain model proposed here the causal potency of an idea, or an ideal,becomes just as real as that of a molecule, a cell, or a nerve impulse. Ideascause ideas and help evolve new ideas. They interact with each other and withother mental forces in the same brain, in neighboring brains, and thanks toglobal communication, in far distant, foreign brains. And they also interactwith the external surroundings to produce in toto a burstwise advance inevolution that is far beyond anything to hit the evolutionary scene yet.27[32_endnote-title.html#c10e27]Mind-Body InteractionCritics of mentalism and dualism often question how two fundamentally differentproperties, such as mind and matter, could possibly interact. How can somethingnonspatial, with no mass, location, or physical dimensions, possibly influencespatially bound matter? As K. R. Rao writes:The main problem with such dualism is the problem of interaction. How doesunextended mind interact with the extended body? Any kind of causal interactionbetween them, which is presumed by most dualist theories, comes into conflictwith the physical theory that the universe is a closed system and that everyphysical event is linked with an antecedent physical event. This assumptionpreempts any possibility that a mental act can cause a physical event.28[32_endnote-title.html#c10e28]Of course, we know now that the universe is not a closed system and that thecollapse of the wave function—a physical event—is linked with an antecedentmental event. The objection Rao describes is of course based on classicalphysics.Furthermore, by asking “How does unextended mind interact with the extendedbody?” Rao is making the implicit assumption that phenomena that exist as causeand effect must have something in common in order to exist as cause and effect.So is this a logical necessity? Or is it rather an empirical truth, a fact aboutnature? As David Hume pointed out long ago, anything in principle could be thecause of anything else, and so only observation can establish what causes what.Parapsychologist John Beloff considers the issue logically:If an event A never occurred without being preceded by some other event B, wewould surely want to say that the second event was a necessary condition orcause of the first event, whether or not the two had anything else in common. Asfor such a principle being an empirical truth, how could it be since there arehere only two known independent substances, i.e. mind and matter, as candidateson which to base a generalization? To argue that they cannot interact becausethey are independent is to beg the question. . . . It says something about thedesperation of those who want to dismiss radical dualism that such phonyarguments should repeatedly be invoked by highly reputable philosophers whoshould know better.29 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e29]Popper also rejects completely the idea that only like can act upon like,describing this as resting on obsolete notions of physics. For an example ofunlikes acting on one another we have interaction between the four known andvery different forces, and between forces and physical bodies. Popper considersthe issue empirically:In the present state of physics we are faced, not with a plurality ofsubstances, but with a plurality of different kinds of forces, and thus with apluralism of different interacting explanatory principles. Perhaps the clearestphysical example against the thesis that only like things can act upon eachother is this: In modern physics, the action of bodies upon bodies is mediatedby fields—by gravitational and electrical fields. Thus like does not act uponlike, but bodies act first upon fields, which they modify, and then the modifiedfield acts upon another body.30 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e30]It should be clear that the idea that only like can act upon like rests upon anobsolete, billiard-ball notion of causation in physics.31[32_endnote-title.html#c10e31]So Are We Free?And what does all this imply about free will? Sperry writes that “the proposedbrain model provides in large measure the mental forces and abilities todetermine one’s own actions. It provides a high degree of freedom from outsideforces as well as mastery over the inner molecular and atomic forces of thebody. In other words, it provides plenty of free will as long as we think offree will as self-determination.”32 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e32] So,accordingly, a person does indeed determine with his own mind what he is goingto do from a range of alternatives, but the ultimate choice is restricted by avariety of factors, including available information and mental acuity. Perhapsthe ultimate form of free will would not be complete freedom from all causalfactors but rather unlimited causal contact with all relevant information,scenarios, choices, and possible results.And, of course, our choices are in large part determined by our personalpreferences, experiences, and cultural and inherited factors. It could be arguedthat this is a form of determinism, but do we really wish to be free fromourselves? As Arthur Schopenhauer wondered, “We may be free to do as we please,but are we free to please as we please?”With this conception of free will it could be argued that the more we learn, thewider the experience we gain, the more logical we become, the greater ourknowledge of ourselves and of history, the more our sciences advance, thegreater then the extent of true human freedom. However, an interestingexperiment was performed by a psychologist in the late 1980s that seems to havebearing on the subject of free will and may imply a different conclusion.Benjamin Libet, at the University of California at San Francisco, asked subjectsto push a button at a moment of their choosing while they noted the moment oftheir decision as displayed on a clock. He found that subjects on average tookabout a fifth of a second to flex their fingers after they had decided to do so.But data from an electroencephalograph monitoring their brain waves showed aspike in electrical activity about a third of a second before they consciouslydecided to push the button. Some have interpreted this result as implying thatour decisions may be unconsciously determined for us before we are aware of thedecision, and thus free will is only an illusion.Before we jump to this conclusion, however, we immediately recognize that we donot typically make our decisions the way these subjects arbitrarily decided toflex their fingers. Decisions on anything important are usually made bygathering information and mulling over the different possibilities and theirimplications. The decision to push a button at the moment of our choosing, bycontrast, seems to involve waiting for the trivial urge to strike us, a ratherrandom, indeterminate process.Libet himself believes that one implication of his work is an altered view ofhow we exercise free will:The role of conscious free will would be, then, not to initiate a voluntary act,but rather to control whether the act takes place. We may view the unconsciousinitiatives for voluntary actions as “bubbling up” in the brain. Theconscious-will then selects which of these initiatives may go forward to anaction or which ones to veto or abort, with no act appearing. . . . Theexistence of a veto possibility is not in doubt. The subjects in our experimentsat times reported that a conscious wish or urge to act appeared but that theysuppressed or vetoed that. . . . All of us, not just experimental subjects, haveexperienced our vetoing a spontaneous urge to perform some act. This oftenoccurs when the urge to act involves some socially unacceptable consequence,like an urge to shout some obscenity at the professor.33[32_endnote-title.html#c10e33]He also considers and rejects the possibility that the conscious veto itself mayhave its origin in preceding unconscious processes, writing thatthe conscious veto is a control function, different from simply becoming awareof the wish to act. There is no logical imperative in any mind-brain theory,even identity theory, that requires specific neural activity to precede anddetermine the nature of a conscious control function. And, there is noexperimental evidence against the possibility that the control process mayappear without development by prior unconscious processes.Popper would take this as another example of downward causation, as nonrandomselection from a choice of random alternatives: “The selection of a kind ofbehavior out of a randomly offered repertoire may be an act of choice, even anact of free will.”34 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e34] If quantum phenomena haveany real effect in the brain, then perhaps their random influences are acceptedwhen they fit into the higher-level structure; otherwise they are rejected.But there is another interpretation, due to another of Libet’s experiments. In1973 Libet found that electrical stimulation of the sensory cortex—that part ofthe brain’s surface primarily responsible for processing tactile informationfrom the skin—did not result in conscious sensation unless the stimulation wasprolonged for at least 500 milliseconds (0.5 second). The necessity of 500milliseconds of cortical stimulation before the signal was felt also held forstimulation of the skin: in both cases, if the signal as recorded in the cortexwas less than half a second long, it was not consciously experienced. This doesnot mean that the signal at the skin must last half a second, but rather thatthe secondary signals at the surface of the brain must last at least half asecond before they can be consciously experienced.However, Libet found that patients experienced their finger shocks almostimmediately, between 10 and 20 milliseconds after the shock was applied. Typicalreaction time—the time it takes to perceive a shock and push a button—is about100 milliseconds (0.1 second). So how can Libet’s observation that 500milliseconds of neural activity is required before a shock can be felt bereconciled with the fact that we can perceive and respond to such shocks inabout one-fifth the time they apparently require to become part of consciousexperience?In a series of ingenious experiments involving electrical stimulation of bothskin and cortex, Libet resolved this paradox. What appears to happen is that thetactile signal reaches the cortex in about 10 milliseconds but is notconsciously perceived. However, the arrival time is unconsciously marked in somemanner. Then, if the cortical activity due to the skin response is notinterrupted but allowed to continue for at least 500 milliseconds, the shock isfelt. But it is not felt half a second late: rather, it is “backdated” to theoriginal arrival time of the signal.These surprising results seem to refute the idea that every mental experience isdirectly correlated with a physical process in the brain. Or, as neuroscientistJohn Eccles put it, “there can be a temporal discrepancy between neural eventsand the experiences of the self conscious mind.”v [38_notes.html#ten22]Dean Radin takes this idea a step further: He notes that the equations of bothclassical and quantum physics are neutral with respect to the direction of timeand so do not rule out the possibility of future events causing events in thepast. In addition, he has presented some experimental evidence that individualscan subconsciously react to future events.At the University of Nevada, people were shown a series of pictures on acomputer screen. Most of the images were of an emotionally calming nature, suchas images of landscapes and various nature scenes, but some were meant to bearousing or disturbing, including pornographic photos and pictures of corpses.At the beginning of each trial, the screen was blank. The participant wouldstart the trial by pressing a mouse button. After five seconds, one of theseimages, calm or emotional, was shown for three seconds, and then the screenwould go blank again. Ten seconds later, a message informed participants thatthey could press the mouse button again whenever they felt ready for the nexttrial. Five seconds after pressing the mouse button, another picture would bedisplayed, and the session would continue until forty pictures had been shown.The order in which the pictures were displayed was chosen randomly by thecomputer. Throughout the session the participants’ heart rate, skin resistance,and blood volume in the fingertips were monitored.Not surprisingly, dramatic changes in all three physiological measures wererecorded when the emotional pictures were shown. But what was remarkable wasthat the arousal began before the emotional picture was displayed, even thoughthe participants could not have known by any normal means what sort of picturewas going to be displayed next. This effect, of unconsciously preparing for areaction to an impending event, has been labeled “presentiment” and has beenreplicated independently by a laboratory in Holland.35[32_endnote-title.html#c10e35]As Radin notes, if we allow “for the possibility of signals traveling backwardin time, then what Libet saw [in the experiment involving deciding when to pusha button] may be the brain’s response to its own decision taking place a thirdof a second in the future.”36 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e36] In other words,given the apparent temporal discrepancy between neural events and theexperiences of the self-conscious mind, the subconscious mind may generateneural activity in order to prepare the brain for the execution of an impendingdecision. The second experiment described may be an example of the reverse: themind may experience and respond to a sensation because of a signal from thefuture state of the brain.THE CONSCIOUSNESS REVOLUTIONSince the early 1970s, the idea that consciousness exerts causal effects hasgained wide support in the cognitive sciences, especially in psychology, whereit has become the majority position. This movement has been referred tovariously as the “consciousness revolution,” the “cognitive revolution,” or the“mentalist revolution,” and it has led to the overthrow of behaviorism as thedominant paradigm in psychology. Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner writes that“today the theoretical claims of behaviorism are largely of historical interest.The cognitive revolution . . . has carried the day.”37[32_endnote-title.html#c10e37] And Sperry himself commented on the paradigmshift, writing that “the accepted role of conscious experience in brain functionand behavior changed from that of a noncausal, epiphenomenal, parallel, oridentical status (and something best ignored or excluded from scientificexplanation) to that of an ineliminable causal, or interactional role.”38[32_endnote-title.html#c10e38] The appearance in neuroscience of a plausible,logical explanation for the causal effects of consciousness has also influencedother neuroscientists39 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e39] and has been accepted bysome philosophers concerned with the ancient mind-brain problem.40[32_endnote-title.html#c10e40]It is curious how quantum physicists in the tradition of von Neumann, studyingthe most fundamental level of reality, and cognitive scientists working at theother end of the spectrum of science should come to almost identical conclusionsregarding the causal role of consciousness. Wigner, in his essay “Remarks on theMind-Body Question,” first notes the effects that physical properties have onmental sensations, and asks, “Does conversely, the consciousness influence thephysicochemical conditions?”He notes that the traditional answer among biochemists has been “no”: the bodyinfluences the mind but the mind does not influence the body. Wigner thenpresents two reasons why physicists should not support this view. The firstreason he gives is the causal role of the observer in quantum mechanics, asdiscussed above. The other is more classical: “The second argument to supportthe existence of an influence of the consciousness on the physical world isbased on the observation that we do not know of any phenomenon in which onesubject is influenced by another without exerting an influence thereupon.”41[32_endnote-title.html#c10e41]Harold Morowitz, professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry at Yale,noted in his article “Rediscovering the Mind” a strange phenomenon occurring inthe dominant paradigms of psychologists, biologists, and physicists. He notesthat while biologists have been relentlessly moving toward the hard-corematerialism that characterized nineteenth-century physics, “at the same time,physicists, faced with compelling experimental evidence, have been moving awayfrom strictly mechanical models of the universe to a view that sees the mind asplaying an integral role in all physical events. It is as if the two disciplineswere on fast-moving trains, going in opposite directions and not noticing whatis happening across the tracks.”42 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e42] Biologists ofa materialist bent, such as Francis Crick, seek to explain mind andconsciousness by activities of the central nervous system, which can be reducedto a biological substructure. They then seek to understand biological phenomenain terms of chemistry, biophysics, and, ultimately, in terms of quantummechanics, which quantum theorists in the von Neumann tradition believe must beformulated with mind as a primary component of the system. As Morowitz writes,“We have thus, in separate steps, gone around an epistemological circle—from themind, back to the mind.”43 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e43]At the logical core of our most materialistic science we meet not dead matterbut our own lively selves.NICK HERBERTIf Sperry’s work is to be criticized, then it should be on the grounds that itis incomplete because it ignores the similar conclusions of the quantumphysicists. Sperry based his conclusions regarding consciousness on a rejectionof classical reductionism; the physicists who follow von Neumann base theirconclusions regarding the causal role of consciousness on a rejection of theclassical assumptions of determinism and observer independence. The positionsare similar but not exactly the same. The main difference seems to be thatSperry’s position is still rooted in the materialist hypothesis that mindultimately depends upon matter for its existence, whereas the von Neumanninterpretation of reality leaves open the possibility that the mind is not anemergent but rather an elemental property—that is, a basic constituent of theuniverse as elemental as energy and force fields. This is obviously a moreradical position, but in its favor we should note that it would resolve theparadox mentioned earlier that is raised by the von Neumann interpretation: Ifconsciousness depends on the physical world, and the value of many quantumphysical properties depend on consciousness, then how did the physical worldever bring about consciousness in the first place?These are fascinating and important issues, which will be discussed in moredetail later. But, for now, it is sufficient to note how the quantum theoristshave come to almost the same conclusions as Popper and Sperry, but by rejectingdifferent aspects of classical metaphysics. Quantum physicist Henry Stapp hasdescribed how, for centuries, philosophy has been hamstrung by its dependenceupon the metaphysical implications of classical physics:Philosophers have tried for three centuries to understand the role of mind inthe workings of a brain conceived to function according to principles ofclassical physics. We now know that no such brain actually exists. . . . Henceit is hardly surprising that those endeavors of philosophers have been beset byenormous difficulties, which have led to such positions as that of the“eliminative materialists,” who hold that our conscious thoughts do not exist;or of the “epiphenomenalists,” who admit that human experiences do exist butclaim that they play absolutely no role in how we behave; or of the “identitytheorists,” who claim that each conscious feeling is exactly the same thing as amotion of the particles that nineteenth century science thought brains andeverything else in the universe to be made of. The difficulties in reconcilingmental realities with prequantum physics is dramatized by the fact that for manyyears the mere mention of “consciousness” was considered evidence ofbackwardness and bad taste in most of academia, including, incredibly, even thephilosophy of mind.44 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e44]So, what does all of this imply for the scientific acceptance of psi phenomena?In a nutshell, the refutation of materialism removes the last barrier skepticscan raise about the scientific legitimacy of psi. Psi phenomena, such astelepathy, are tightly bound up with notions such as “intent” and “values,” andtheir operation seems to indicate a causal role for consciousness. Ifconsciousness were a mere epiphenomenon, how could it be that one mindinfluences another according to the desires, values, and interests of bothparties? Psi phenomena, if real, represent the operations of minds upon minds,and minds upon matter. And as they do not appear to operate in a random manner,the desires and values of these minds appear to play crucial causal roles. Thenew view of mind as causal, which has gained widespread scientific acceptancesince the early 1970s, is consistent with the theoretical possibility of psi.w[38_notes.html#ten23] It can no longer be cogently argued that materialism is apillar of the modern scientific view and that parapsychology is in seriousconflict with modern science because the acceptance of psi would underminematerialism.Perhaps not surprisingly, Susan Blackmore disagrees. In a recent essay, shenotes that telepathy and psychokinesis are commonly seen as evidence for thecausal effect of consciousness, and she then accuses parapsychologists of tryingto prove the power of consciousness. She writes, “It is a desire for this ‘powerof consciousness’ that fuels much enthusiasm for the paranormal.”45[32_endnote-title.html#c10e45] Then, in what seems like a reversion to 1950sbehaviorism, she adds:As our understanding of conscious experience progresses, this desire to find“the power of consciousness” sets parapsychology ever more against the rest ofscience (which of course is part of its appeal). The more we look into theworkings of the brain the less it looks like a machine run by a conscious self.. . . Indeed, the brain seems to be a machine that runs itself very well andproduces an illusion that there is someone in charge. This illusion is just whatmeditators and spiritual practitioners have been saying for millennia; that ourordinary view of ourselves, as conscious, active agents experiencing a realworld, is wrong—an illusion. Now science seems to be coming to the sameconclusion.Parapsychology is going the other way. It is trying to prove that consciousnessreally does have power; that our minds really can reach out and “do” things.Well, if a belief in the “power of consciousness” sets parapsychology “ever moreagainst the rest of science,” then I suppose that neuroscientists Roger Sperry,Sir John Eccles, and D. M. MacKay; brain surgeons Charles Sherrington and WilderPenfield; philosopher of science Karl Popper; physicists Eugene Wigner and HenryStapp; and Charles Darwin are all set against the rest of science, not tomention the majority of contemporary psychologists. It may be more plausible tosay that her dogmatic opposition to the power of consciousness sets SusanBlackmore ever more against the rest of science.Benjamin Libet, whose experimental work is sometimes offered as scientificevidence that free will is an illusion, has expressed strong opposition to thisinterpretation.The intuitive feelings about the phenomenon of free will form a fundamentalbasis for views of our human nature, and great care should be taken not tobelieve allegedly scientific conclusions about them which actually depend uponhidden ad hoc assumptions. A theory that simply interprets the phenomenon offree will as illusory and denies the validity of this phenomenal fact is lessattractive than a theory that accepts or accommodates the phenomenal fact.In an issue so fundamentally important to our view of who we are, a claim forillusory nature should be based on fairly direct evidence. Such evidence is notavailable; nor do determinists propose even a potential experimental design totest the theory.My conclusion about free will, one genuinely free in the nondetermined sense, isthen that its existence is at least as good, if not a better, scientific optionthan is its denial by a determinist theory.46 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e46]In the same journal, Henry Stapp expresses the same opinion as Libet, writingthat epiphenomenalism is a mistake arising from outmoded classical physics:There is no compulsion from the basic principles of physics that requires anyrejection of the sensible idea that mental effort can actually do what it seemsto do. . . . It is therefore simply wrong to proclaim that the findings ofscience entail that our intuitions about the nature of our thoughts arenecessarily illusory or false. Rather, it is completely in line withcontemporary science to hold our thoughts to be causally efficacious.47[32_endnote-title.html#c10e47] (emphasis added)Rather than being in conflict with the rest of science, evidence of psiphenomena provides further reason to think that materialism is fatally flawed.Indeed, it would seem that the acceptance of psi would clinch the argument: inthe absence of psi, epiphenomenalism may be a strained and threadbare option,but it still remains a theoretical possibility. However, unlike ordinarycommunication, perception, or action, psi phenomena seem to involve the directaction of mind-on-mind or between mind and matter, bypassing the normalbiological channels. For a dualist, this poses no problem: it has beenconjectured that when a person exercises psi, his mind is being influenced by oris influencing objects or brains outside of his body in the same way his mindnormally interacts with his own brain.48 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e48]x[38_notes.html#ten24] After all, each type of interaction is no more mysteriousthan the other, even though one is commonplace and the other relatively rare.But as the arguments above have shown, and as Popper has written, “radicalphysicalism can be regarded as refuted, quite independently of theparanormal.”49 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e49]Materialism may have been useful as a source of inspiration for classicalscience, but in hindsight it can be viewed as an error of determinism,observer-independence, and reductionism.WHY ARE WE CONSCIOUS?With the emergence of consciousness something new and utterly different hasentered the universe—something with no mass or physical dimensions, yetpossessing enormous power. And while mental activity seems to exert causalinfluence, much of our mental activity is unconscious. Consciousness seems to beemployed when dealing with novel situations and when learning new skills.Learning to drive a vehicle requires conscious attention to detail, but once wehave mastered the skills required, we can operate the vehicle unconsciously, onautomatic pilot, all the while carrying on a detailed conversation. But as soonas something out of the ordinary happens, such as an animal darting into ourpath, conscious control returns to deal with the unexpected.Renowned neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield thought that the relationship of mind tobrain was that of programmer to computer: The mind programs the brain to handleroutine tasks, freeing itself to do other things. From his work with epilepticpatients, Penfield noted that an epileptic discharge may confine itself to onefunctional area within the brain. If, for instance, the speech area of thecerebral cortex were the only part affected, then the epileptic discharge wouldproduce nothing more than paralytic silence. If, however, the discharge occurredin the higher brain stem, which Penfield identified as the “seat ofconsciousness,” then he described how the individual was converted into amindless automaton: “He may wander about, confused and aimless. Or he maycontinue to carry out whatever purpose his mind was in the act of handing on tohis automatic sensory-motor mechanism when the highest brain-mechanism went outof action. Or he follows a stereotyped, habitual pattern of behavior. In everycase, however, the automaton can make few, if any, decisions for which there hasbeen no precedent.”50 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e50]Penfield provides several examples of patients who suffered attacks in thehigher brain stem while playing piano, walking home through busy streets, ordriving a car. In these cases the individuals continued on with what they weredoing, although retained no memory of doing so. He describes what happens whenthe “seat of consciousness” is temporarily incapacitated:The human automaton, which replaces the man when the highest brain-mechanism isinactivated, is a thing without the capacity to make completely new decisions.It is a thing without the capacity to form new memory records and a thingwithout that indefinable attribute, a sense of humor. The automaton is incapableof thrilling to the beauty of a sunset or of experiencing contentment,happiness, love, compassion. These, like all awareness, are functions of themind. The automaton is a thing that makes use of the reflexes and the skills,inborn and acquired, that are housed in the computer. At times it may have aplan that will serve it in place of a purpose for a few minutes. This automaticcoordinator that is ever active within each of us, seems to be the most amazingof biological computers.51 [32_endnote-title.html#c10e51]Consciousness seems to resemble a searchlight beam that illuminates the parts ofour mental activity accessible to it, on demand, as determined by our drives anddesires. But it remains a mystery why conscious mental activity is required atall, even for dealing with novel situations. Perhaps the reason has to do withemotion. It is possible to be conscious without emotion, but is it possible tofeel emotion without being conscious? Perhaps our animal ancestors that weremotivated by primitive emotion simply enjoyed a decisive advantage over theirlesssentient competitors.Consciousness, or at least aspects of it, may very well enhance an organism’sability to survive and propagate, but some conscious activity seems to havelittle if anything to do with biological survival, even among our cousins in theanimal kingdom. Birds have been known to tumble in the wind, dolphins have beenspotted body surfing, and wild eagles have been seen playing catch. It’sdifficult to explain these activities in terms of contributing to survival, asdifficult as it is to explain the survival value of listening to music, playingchess, or drinking wine.y [38_notes.html#ten25]And it must be stressed how little we are actually saying when we describeconsciousness as an emergent property. We certainly have no idea howconsciousness could possibly emerge from the configurational properties of thebrain. At any rate, saying consciousness emerges does not, to my mind,necessarily imply that consciousness depends for its existence on a materialbrain—that is, did not exist before the full development of brains, and cannotexist without material brains. It seems coherent to speculate that consciousnessmay have emerged into the material world when conditions finally allowed—thatis, when primitive brains finally achieved the required level of complexity.So the brain may be necessary for consciousness to emerge into and interfacewith the material world. As mentioned, some writers, such as physicist NickHerbert, would then describe consciousness as an elemental property, rather thanan emergent one. Herbert and other physicists in the von Neumann traditionseriously entertain the idea that consciousness is a property of the universe aselemental as energy and force fields, and that mind interacts with matter at thelevel of the emergence into actuality of individual quantum events. As mentionedearlier, this would resolve the paradox of existence that is raised by the vonNeumann interpretation.At any rate, it could be argued that the distinction between elemental andemergent is largely semantic. When we say a rabbit emerges from a hole, are weimplying that the rabbit depends on the hole for its existence? Yet it must beadmitted that when we describe a property as “emergent” we are usually referringto its creation as a result of the special arrangement in space and time of itsconstituent parts, and so perhaps a dependency is implied. Perhaps a respect forconventional usage requires a dualist to describe consciousness as an elementalrather than an emergent property.However, without presenting any empirical evidence to support the existence ofpre-and-postmortem consciousness, dualism is pure speculation. Nothing discussedso far has provided solid support for dualism as opposed to mere mentalism.Support for dualism depends upon the evidence for disembodied consciousness thatwill be discussed in the second book of this series."},{"pageContent":"ELEVENThe “Extraordinary Claims” of ParapsychologySkeptics often quote Carl Sagan’s remark that “extraordinary claims requireextraordinary evidence,” and certainly this rule of thumb is useful as a guide.But we must remember that we have no objective guidelines as to what constitutesan “extraordinary claim” or what counts as “extraordinary evidence.” And as ourtheories change, what was once considered extraordinary can become quiteordinary—as, for instance, has happened with the acceptance of meteorites,continental drift, and quantum mechanics. What makes the claims of the psiresearchers so extraordinary to the skeptics is the supposed inconsistency ofpsi with all of modern science. This misconception, probably more than any otherfactor, explains the continuing refusal of the skeptics to accept the best ofthe latest evidence as conclusive, even when they have run out ofcounterexplanations.It also explains why the controversy has continued for as long as it has. In anyother field, the debate would have ended long ago. Back in 1951, thepsychologist Donald Hebb wrote:Why do we not accept ESP as a psychological fact? Rhine has offered enoughevidence to have convinced us on almost any other issue. . . . Personally, I donot accept ESP for a moment, because it does not make sense. My externalcriteria, both of physics and of physiology, say that ESP is not a fact despitethe behavioral evidence that has been reported. I cannot see what other basis mycolleagues have for rejecting it. . . . Rhine may still turn out to be right,improbable as I think that is, and my own rejection of his view is—in theliteral sense—prejudice.1 [32_endnote-title.html#c11e1]As mentioned earlier, in 1955 George Price wrote that “believers in psychicphenomena . . . appear to have won a decisive victory and virtually silencedopposition. . . . This victory is the result of careful experimentation andintelligent argumentation. Dozens of experimenters have obtained positiveresults in ESP experiments, and the mathematical procedures have been approvedby leading statisticians.”2 [32_endnote-title.html#c11e2] Yet later in the samearticle, after writing that “ESP is incompatible with current scientifictheory,” he offers his conclusion:My opinion concerning the findings of the parapsychologists is that many of themare dependent on clerical and statistical errors and unintentional use ofsensory cues, and that all extrachance results not so explicable are dependenton deliberate fraud or mildly abnormal mental conditions.3[32_endnote-title.html#c11e3]Here we have two skeptics in effect admitting that if this were any other fieldof inquiry—that is, one with results less threatening to a worldview based onseventeenth-century science—then the experimental data would have carried theday by 1950.As we have seen, similar views are still held by many in the skepticalcommunity, despite the fact that the experimental evidence today is even moreimpressive than it was in the 1950s. In 2007 Rupert Sheldrake engaged militantatheist Richard Dawkins in a filmed debate for a television program calledEnemies of Reason, in which Dawkins raised the issue of “extraordinary claims.”However, unlike Hebb in 1951, Dawkins expressed willful ignorance of theevidence. Sheldrake recalls the debate:Dawkins said in a romantic spirit he himself would like to believe in telepathy,but there just wasn’t any evidence for it. He dismissed all research on thesubject out of hand, without going into any details. He said that if it reallyoccurred it would “turn the laws of physics upside down,” and added,“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”“This depends on what you regard as extraordinary,” I replied. “The majority ofthe population say they have experienced telepathy, especially in connectionwith telephone calls. In that sense, telepathy is ordinary. The claim that mostpeople are deluded about their own experience is extraordinary. Where is theextraordinary evidence for that?”He could not produce any evidence at all, apart from generic arguments about thefallibility of human judgment. We then agreed that controlled experiments werenecessary. I said that this is why I had actually been doing such experiments,including tests to find out if people really could tell who was calling them onthe telephone when the caller was selected at random. The results were far abovechance level. The previous week I had sent Dawkins copies of some of my papersin scientific journals so that he could examine some of the data before we met.At this stage he looked uneasy and said, “I don’t want to discuss evidence.”“Why not?” I asked. He replied, “There isn’t time. It’s too complicated.” Thecamera stopped.4 [32_endnote-title.html#c11e4]Parapsychologist Charles Honorton has shown how the skeptical criticisms fallinto three categories and in each major phase of the controversy have followedthis pattern: * Statistical criticisms seeking to demonstrate that the claimed effects are not really significant. This type of criticism has usually been championed by psychologists and refuted by statisticians. If critics could sustain their case at this point, the controversy would end here. * Methodological criticisms asserting that the effects are caused by procedural flaws. . . . Advocates of flaw hypotheses have seldom subjected their flaw hypotheses to empirical test, but have tended instead to argue for their plausibility. In response, parapsychologists have conducted new experiments that eliminate the suspected flaws. * Speculative criticisms based on a priori and ad hominem arguments. This form of criticism has usually been founded on the assumption that the existence of psi phenomena is incompatible with fundamental scientific principles, but the proponents of a priori arguments have never successfully demonstrated the nature of such incompatibilities.5 [32_endnote-title.html#c11e5]There is a relationship between these three categories of criticisms. At eachstage of the debate, the statistical criticisms have been advanced first andhave been easily refuted, as of the three they are the most straightforward andeasily dealt with. Then the other two types have followed, with themethodological criticisms consisting of allegations that the results could havebeen due to such flaws as sensory leakage, hidden cues, recording errors, and soforth. In response, parapsychologists have conducted new experiments that haveeliminated the suspected flaws, but the critics have (until now in the case ofthe autoganzfeld) always returned with new counterexplanations, sometimesalleging complex and elaborate fraud scenarios.6 [32_endnote-title.html#c11e6]But the driving force behind the first two types of criticisms has always beenthe belief behind the third, that the existence of psi phenomena is incompatiblewith fundamental scientific principles. This is evident in the following remarkfrom Paul Kurtz, one of the founding fathers of CSICOP:A high degree of replicability is essential to the further development ofparapsychology. Some sciences may be exempt from the replicability criterion,but this is only the case if their findings do not contradict the generalconceptual framework of scientific knowledge, which parapsychology seems to do.According to the parapsychologists, for example, ESP seems to be independent ofspace and does not weaken with distance; precognition presupposes backwardcausation; psychokinesis violates the conservation-of-energy law.7[32_endnote-title.html#c11e7]The first alleged contradiction (“ESP seems to be independent of space and doesnot weaken with distance”) has already been dealt with in our discussion ofnonlocality. What about the other two?"},{"pageContent":"TWELVEPsi and PhysicsAlthough, as we have seen, there is every reason to think that the current lawsof physics are incomplete and will eventually be rewritten as they have beenseveral times before, the acceptance of psi would not by itself require thatthey be rewritten, as the current laws of physics are not violated by paranormalphenomena. Despite psychologist Ray Hyman’s insistence that our acceptance ofthe existence of psi would require that “we abandon relativity and quantummechanics in their current formulations,”1 [32_endnote-title.html#c12e1] itappears that many physicists do not share this opinion. Consider this remark byquantum theorist Euan Squires that seems to bear directly on what is probablythe most intuitively distressing of all psi phenomena—precognition:Bearing in mind the issue of causality, we might ask . . . why we believe thatthe past causes the present. Indeed, we could wonder why there is such adifference between the past, which we remember, and the future, which we don’t!In case we are tempted to think these things are just obvious, we should notethat the fundamental laws of physics are completely neutral with regard to thedirection of time, i.e., they are unchanged if we change the direction of thetime variable. Concepts like “past” and “present,” separated by “now,” do nothave a natural place in the laws of physics. Presumably this is why Einstein wasable to write to a friend that the distinction between past and present was onlya “stubbornly persistent illusion.” . . . What effect does quantum theory haveon such discussions? Like classical mechanics, orthodox quantum theory isinvariant under a change in the direction of time.2[32_endnote-title.html#c12e2] (emphasis added)Physicist Gerald Feinberg also commented on the compatibility between modernphysics and precognition:Instead of forbidding precognition from happening, [accepted physical] theoriestypically have sufficient symmetry (between past and future) to suggest thatphenomena akin to precognition should occur. . . . Indeed, phenomena involving areversed time order of cause and effect are generally excluded fromconsideration on the ground that they have not been observed, rather thanbecause the theory forbids them. This exclusion itself introduces an element ofasymmetry into the physical theories, which some physicists have felt wasimproper or required further explanation. . . . Thus, if such phenomena indeedoccur, no change in the fundamental equations of physics would be needed todescribe them.3 [32_endnote-title.html#c12e3] (emphasis added)Another objection that has been raised is that the existence of psychokinesiswould violate the first law of thermodynamics: energy can neither be created nordestroyed, merely transformed. CSICOP chairman Paul Kurtz writes:What would happen to the conservation-of-energy principle if PK were a fact? Howcan a mental entity cause a physical change in the state of matter? Comparingthe alleged evidence for PK with the need to overthrow a basic, well-documentedprinciple of physics is questionable.4 [32_endnote-title.html#c12e4]An identical objection has been raised by the philosopher Daniel Dennett as abasis for arguing that dualism is a physical impossibility.5[32_endnote-title.html#c12e5]a [38_notes.html#twelve1]b [38_notes.html#twelve2]Physicists Rosenblum and Kuttner disagree:Some theorists deny the possibility of duality by arguing that a signal from anonmaterial mind could not carry energy and thus could not influence materialbrain cells. Because of this inability of a mind to supply energy to influencethe neurons of the brain, it is claimed that physics demonstrates an inescapableflaw of dualism. However, no energy need be involved in determining to whichparticular situation a wave function collapses. Thus the determination of whichof the physically possible conscious experiences becomes the actual experienceis a process that need not involve energy transfer. Quantum mechanics thereforeallows an escape from the supposed fatal flaw of dualism. It is a mistake tothink that dualism can be ruled out on the basis of physics.6[32_endnote-title.html#c12e6]As physicist-philosopher C. D. Broad pointed out long ago—at a time when quantummechanics was still in its infancy—even if all physical-to-physical causationinvolves a transfer of energy, we have no reason to think that such a transferwould also be required in mental-to-physical or physicaltomental causation.7[32_endnote-title.html#c12e7] This, of course, is completely consistent with thepoint made above by quantum physicists Rosenblum and Kuttner.The influence of the mental on the physical does not violate the laws of modernphysics. Recognizing that a single quantum event may suffice to make a neurondischarge, John Eccles and other neuroscientists have speculated that the mindinteracts with the brain by influencing events in neurons at the quantum level.So if the phenomenon of nonmaterial minds influencing material brain cells atthe quantum level would not involve a violation of modern physics, then neitherwould the influence of minds on Rhine’s dice or on Schmidt’s and Jahn’s randomnumber generators.At any rate, it should be noted that even in classical physics the theory of theconservation of energy does not necessarily rule out interaction between themental and the physical. When some philosophers object that causation of aphysical event by a mental one is precluded by the conservation of energyprinciple, they mean that such influence would imply that a quantity of energyis introduced into the world; this would constitute a violation of theconservation principle, which is often expressed with the statement that in aclosed system the amount of energy is constant.Howeer, as philosopher of science Morris Keeton has pointed out, the propositionthat energy is conserved in the material world is not known, either a priori orempirically, to be true without exception.8 [32_endnote-title.html#c12e8] c[38_notes.html#twelve3] The principle of the conservation of energy, or ofmass-energy, is in fact only a conjecture—a condition that the material worldmust satisfy if it is in fact a wholly, closed, isolated system. When it isasserted that interaction between the mental and physical is impossible becauseit would violate the “principle” of the conservation of energy, then, as Ducasseremarks, “the very point at issue is of course whether or not the material worldis in fact a wholly closed, isolated system.”9 [32_endnote-title.html#c12e9]Some critics, such as George Price, CSICOP chairman and cofounder Paul Kurtz,and the philosopher Antony Flew10 [32_endnote-title.html#c12e10] place greatemphasis on what Broad has called the “basic limiting principles” of science.Unlike Kurtz, Price and Flew admit that they cannot think of any modernscientific law that would be violated by the existence of psi. Back in 1955,Price wrote: “It is sometimes asked: with what scientific laws does ESPconflict? But the conflict is at so fundamental a level as to be not so muchwith named ‘laws’ but rather with basic principles.”11[32_endnote-title.html#c12e11] Thirty years later Flew wrote: “Certainly it isnot easy to think of any particular named law of nature—such as Boyle’s Law orSnell’s Law or what have you—that would be, or is, as Hume would have it,‘violated’ by the occurrence of psi. What that threatens is more fundamental.For the psi phenomena are in effect defined in terms of the violation of certain‘basic limiting principles,’ principles that constitute a framework for all ourthinking about and investigation of human affairs, and principles that arecontinually being verified by our discoveries.”12 [32_endnote-title.html#c12e12]As formulated by Broad in 1949, these “basic limiting principles” include: (1) aperson cannot know the contents of another person’s mind except through the useof normal senses or inferences from them (violated by telepathy); (2) we cannotgain information about a distance point in space without information transmittedto our normal senses (violated by clairvoyance); (3) we cannot have knowledge offuture events not based on inferences from current events (violated byprecognition); (4) we cannot modify the state or motion of any objects withoutthe use of our limbs or tools (violated by psychokinesis); and (5) minds cannotexist apart from brains (violated by the evidence for survival).But, as Stokes has pointed out, Broad’s basic limiting principles are not infact derivable from the known laws of science but are merely restatements of theimpossibility of the various forms of psi phenomena. With the possible exceptionof some forms of psychokinesis, none of the known laws of physics are violatedby the various psi phenomena mentioned here. In fact, as we shall see, many ofthe theoretical explanations, especially the observational theories of Schmidtand Walker, are explicitly constructed in terms of quantum physics.Psi is a property of conscious, living organisms, and the scope of present-dayphysics is limited to dealing only with inanimate objects. Some may argue withjustification that this is its proper scope, but could physics be extended todeal with conscious living organisms? Perhaps, but Eugene Wigner believes thatthis extension would require radical changes: “It will have to be replaced bynew laws, based on new concepts, if organisms with consciousness are to bedescribed. . . . [I]n order to deal with the phenomenon of life, the laws ofphysics will have to be changed, not only reinterpreted.”13[32_endnote-title.html#c12e13] This opinion is echoed in a remark made by Nobellaureate physicist Brian Josephson in response to an interview question fromscience writer Halcomb Noble:You ask whether parapsychology lies within the bounds of physical law. Myfeeling is that to some extent it does, but physical law itself may have to beredefined. It may be that some effects in parapsychology are ordered-stateeffects of a kind not yet encompassed by physical theory.14[32_endnote-title.html#c12e14]Currently, physics does not deal directly with variables such as consciousness,intent, and values: they are outside of its scope. But these variables arecrucial to any explanation of psi, and so it does not seem likely thatparapsychology will be reduced to paraphysics any time soon. As we have seen, animportant fact that emerged from the early work of the experimentalpsychologists was the total absence of any systematic relationships between psieffects and any known physical variables; the operation of psi appears to beunaffected by distance or the presence of barriers. Of course, with the modernconcept of nonlocality, this theoretical objection of the classical physicist isovercome, but what weak relationships can be derived from the data indicate therelevance of psychological variables such as attitude and certain aspects ofpersonality. Physics currently deals only with the world of inanimate matter, inwhich nothing, we may safely say, happens in order to fulfill some objective. Incontrast, psi phenomena appears irreducibly goal-directed in character. JohnBeloff summarizes the dual nature of psi:Psi phenomena are problematic precisely because they involve events in the realworld and thus become candidates for a physical explanation, yet at the sametime they are critically bound up with certain states of mind. Thus they crossthe dividing line between objectivity and subjectivity which normal mentalphenomena do not.15 [32_endnote-title.html#c12e15]Parapsychology deals with the interface between the mental and the physical; itstraddles the boundary between psychology and physics as it studies theinteraction of mind and matter. It should be remembered that psychology is notthe parent discipline of parapsychology, and so the term parapsychology isreally a misnomer. However, it is doubtful that we can ever have a purelyphysical explanation of psi, that is, one that does not include key referencesto purely mental concepts such as intent, meaning, and belief. Consciousnessappears essential in any explanation of psi, for two reasons: (1) results inexperiments seem to depend to a large extent on the beliefs, personalityfactors, and mood of the participants and experimenters, and (2) case studiesfrom the field (or anecdotal reports, if you prefer) seem to strongly indicatethat it is meaningful, useful information that is usually detected via telepathyor clairvoyance, not random noise. PK similarly appears to be goal-directed. So,we are dealing both with aspects of mind (the subjective) and events in the realworld (the objective). Since explanations of psi need to incorporate both themental and the physical, the contributions of both psychology and physics arecrucial. As we have seen, some experiments have strongly suggested thatconsciousness can not only collapse the state vector, but it can also bias theoutcome. We have also seen that psi seems unaffected by distance or barriers,suggesting that psi phenomena may exploit nonlocality. Perhaps the requiredbridge between psychology and physics will be built on the concepts of theobserver effect and nonlocality.As mentioned earlier, adherence to an outmoded metaphysics of science seems muchmore prevalent among psychologists than physicists. In the survey mentionedearlier, only 3 percent of natural scientists considered ESP “an impossibility,”compared to 34 percent of psychologists. And of course many of today’s leadingskeptics—such as Ray Hyman, Susan Blackmore, James Alcock, and RichardWiseman—are psychologists.Accordingly, the great psychologist Gardner Murphy, president of the AmericanPsychological Association, and later of the American Society for PsychicalResearch, has urged his fellow psychologists to become better acquainted withmodern physics.. . . the difficulty is at the level of physics, not at the level of psychology.Psychologists may be a little bewildered when they encounter modern physicistswho take these phenomena in stride, in fact, take them much more seriously thanpsychologists do, saying, as physicists, that they are no longer bound by thetypes of Newtonian energy distribution, inverse square laws, etc., with whichscientists used to regard themselves as tightly bound. . . . [P]sychologistsprobably will witness a period of slow, but definite, erosion of the blandlyexclusive attitude that has offered itself as the only appropriate scientificattitude in this field. The data from parapsychology will be almost certainly inharmony with general psychological principles and will be assimilated rathereasily within the systematic framework of psychology as a science when once theimagined appropriateness of Newtonian physics is put aside, and modern physicsreplaces it.16 [32_endnote-title.html#c12e16]"},{"pageContent":"THIRTEENToward a New WorldviewDespite what several of the prominent skeptics claim, it should be clear nowthat the existence of psi is consistent with the new metaphysics of science,especially with its acceptance of nonlocality, emergent properties, and thecausal role of consciousness. Unfamiliarity with the new metaphysicalimplications of science explains the dogmatism we so often find regarding psi—ifa person’s a priori conviction is that the existence of psi phenomena wouldrender most of modern science obsolete, then almost any normal explanation, nomatter how improbable or convoluted, will be preferable to an explanationinvolving psi.We are in a better position now to understand the resistance of some mainstreamscientists to accepting the reality of psi. The main reasons for theirresistance would seem to be: (1) lack of awareness of the experimental evidence;(2) fear of ridicule because of the rhetorical campaigns of “skepticalorganizations such as CSICOP; (3) adherence to an outmoded metaphysics ofscience; and (4) the inability to explain psi in terms of the generally acceptedtheories of biology and psychology. The rhetorical arguments of the skepticsderive most of their influence from ignorance of the experimental evidence. Asfor the third reason, we have seen that adherence to an outmoded metaphysics ofscience seems much more prevalent among psychologists than physicists. Skepticssuch as psychologist Susan Blackmore are fond of saying that the existence ofpsi is incompatible “with our scientific worldview,” but with which scientificworldview? Psi is certainly incompatible with the old scientific worldview,based on Newtonian mechanics and behaviorist psychology. It is not incompatiblewith the emerging scientific worldview based upon quantum mechanics andcognitive psychology.The case can now be made that the concept of the “paranormal” is an anachronismand should be abandoned. The term is usually used to imply that psi phenomenaoperate outside of nature, in a parallel realm not subject to the rules ofnature as we currently understand them. The term arose within the context ofNewtonian physics, and its primary effect has been to create an artificialschism between psi researchers and the rest of the scientific community. AsHonorton has written:A more empirically fruitful conceptualization is that parapsychology involvesthe study of currently anomalous communication and energetic processes. Thisapproach guides the efforts of most of the parapsychological researchers I know,who work on the assumption that they are dealing with unexplained—anomalous, butnot unexplainable—natural processes.1 [32_endnote-title.html#c13e1]The current inability to explain psi within mainstream physiology and psychologyprobably explains the greater resistance to psi found among some members of thescientific community than among laypersons. Most of the latter are not stronglycommitted, intellectually and emotionally, to the completeness of a particularset of explanations regarding perception and action. So most laypeople are notgreatly troubled by reports of experiences that cannot be explained by thecurrently conventional theories. This also helps explain the acceptance oftelepathy, precognition, and so forth among our prescientific ancestors, andalso among members of so-called “primitive” cultures in modern times. ThomasKuhn, in his classic book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, argued thatscience progresses with the discovery of anomalies, or findings that are notpredicted or explained by a currently accepted theory, which he called a“paradigm.” According to Kuhn, without a paradigm, there are no anomalies:“Anomaly appears only against the background provided by the paradigm.”2[32_endnote-title.html#c13e2]Kuhn presents some case histories showing that when scientists areintellectually and emotionally invested in a particular paradigm, somescientists will label as “impossible” many logically possible phenomena thatcannot be explained within the paradigm. It is important to remember that manyof the phenomena mainstream science accepts today were once ridiculed andconsidered impossible. The idea that rocks could fall from the sky (what we nowcall meteorites) was strongly resisted. The idea of continental drift wasridiculed for decades, simply because no known mechanism could account for it.3[32_endnote-title.html#c13e3]a [38_notes.html#thir1] This resistance to changeseems common among scientists when confronted with anomalies. Even x-rays wereconsidered by some to be an elaborate hoax.4 [32_endnote-title.html#c13e4]But it is highly unlikely that the current generation of skeptics will everchange their minds. No matter what evidence the psi researchers may present,there is a natural human reluctance to admitting that one was wrong all along.As Kuhn pointed out, to some extent science progresses through warfare betweendifferent generations of scientists, with the older generation showing greaterresistance to new ideas. It is a grim fact that progress in science is sometimesmarked by a funeral.b [38_notes.html#thir2]In terms of the scientific worldview due to classical physics, psi phenomena cancertainly be considered anomalous in the Kuhnian sense: that is, they may beconsidered “awkward facts” that violate, in particular, the physical principleof localism and the metaphysical hypothesis that mind can play no causal role innature. In terms of the newly emerging scientific worldview described above,however, it is questionable whether psi phenomena may be considered anomalous atall. If they still may be, then it is only in a much weaker sense, namely, thatwe currently cannot provide a satisfactory explanation of their operation givenour current understanding of physiology and psychology. But this is true of manyphenomena involving the mind, such as hypnosis, dreaming, the role of optimismin healing, and the placebo effect. Largely this is the case because wecurrently have no tenable theories of even ordinary consciousness, let alone itsexotic variations.Scientific revolutions have led to profound changes in our metaphysicaltheories, and it may be that we are on the verge of another profound change asthe phenomenon of consciousness and its effects on the world are increasinglyincorporated into mainstream science. Psi phenomena do not call into questionthe newly emerging scientific worldview, but they do illustrate theincompleteness of our current understanding. Future historians may look back onthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries and shake their heads at the arrogancewith which many of our scientists and philosophers dogmatically dismissedexperiences people in all cultures have reported for thousands of years."},{"pageContent":"QUESTION IIIIs Parapsychology a Science?Psychical research, or parapsychology, has its genesis in the myths, thefolklore, the magic and mysticism of precivilization.

It is a science,later to develop, like the others, order and discrimination in the midst ofchaotic and heterogeneous materials.WALTER FRANKLIN PRINCE, “IS PSYCHICAL RESEARCH WORTH WHILE?”"},{"pageContent":"FOURTEENThe Impoverished State of SkepticismOver the past twenty years, Hyman, Blackmore, and other critics have tried veryhard to show that the results of psi experiments were either not statisticallysignificant, or that they were dependent upon methodological flaws in theexperiments. Having failed on both counts, they have been forced to admit thatparapsychology has demonstrated anomalous effects that need to be explained andalso to admit that they have run out of plausible counterexplanations.The current state of skepticism is indeed impoverished. Blackmore has apparentlythrown in the towel, and Hyman, instead of presenting arguments based on logicand evidence, now offers only a variety of rhetorical arguments designed topersuade us that parapsychology’s status as a normal science is somehowquestionable.For instance, Hyman has written that a “serious challenge to parapsychology’squest for scientific status is the lack of cumulativeness in its database. Onlyparapsychology, among the fields of inquiry claiming scientific status, lacks acumulative database.”1 [32_endnote-title.html#c14e1]As mentioned earlier, in 1940 J. B. Rhine published his landmark bookExtra-Sensory Perception after Sixty Years, which summarized all quantitativeexperiments since the founding of the Society for Psychical Research in 1882.How can we reconcile Hyman’s claim that parapsychology “lacks a cumulativedatabase” with the existence of this book, considered a classic of experimentalparapsychology?And if a cumulative database for psi experiments does not exist, then how couldRadin and Nelson have performed their meta-analysis of RNG PK experiments,conducted between 1959 and 1987? How could Radin and Ferrari have conductedtheir meta-analysis of PK dice experiments using results of experiments datingback to the 1930s? Meta-analysis is by definition the analysis of cumulatedexperiments.The evolution of the ganzfeld experiments provides an excellent counter toHyman’s charge that psi research lacks cumulativeness. As we saw earlier, theganzfeld experiments were inspired by both anecdotal and experimental evidencesuggesting that the operation of psi is facilitated by the altered states ofdreaming, meditation, and hypnosis. This evidence led Honorton to postulate thatpsi may operate as a weak signal that is normally masked by the stronger signalsconstantly besieging us from our conventional sense organs, and the earlyganzfeld was an attempt to re-create the state of physical relaxation,alertness, and reduced sensory input that is common to dreaming, meditation, andhypnosis. The design of the ganzfeld was based upon several lines of previousresearch, and was considered as an improvement upon the earlier dream studies atMaimonides Medical Center in New York City. In turn, the automated ganzfeld wasan improvement over the earlier ganzfeld experiments, following from criticismsof the earlier work and the guidelines agreed upon by Honorton and Hyman.Another one of Hyman’s criticisms involves the use of statistics inparapsychology experiments:Parapsychology is unique among the sciences in relying solely on significantdepartures from a chance baseline to establish the presence of its allegedphenomenon. In the other sciences the defining phenomena can be reliablyobserved and do not require indirect statistical measures to justify theirexistence. Indeed, each branch of science began with phenomena that could beobserved directly.2 [32_endnote-title.html#c14e2]This is indeed an odd criticism. Parapsychology, like the other branches ofscience, also began with phenomena that could be observed directly—in this case,the reports from all of recorded history, some of which we covered earlier.Parapsychologists have been mostly confined to their laboratories since the1920s because the skeptics considered these reports “anecdotal” and“extraordinary,” and so they demanded experimental evidence. Is Hyman nowwilling to treat these reports as serious evidence?The 1988 report “Enhancing Human Performance,” which Hyman contributed to, goesto great lengths to debunk personal reports of paranormal phenomena. Shortlyafter the report’s publication, Colonel Alexander wrote:In private conversation with Ray Hyman, I mentioned a display of PK that I,along with numerous other highly skilled observers, had witnessed at closerange. . . . While this had not been conducted according to the strict protocolsof a “scientific” experiment, nonetheless careful and critical observers allagreed the event had occurred as described.Hyman’s response to me on this occasion was that, while many credible people mayhave truthfully reported such anecdotal experiences, he does not feel obliged todeal with any findings not appearing in the formal journals, no matter howimpressive the reports.3 [32_endnote-title.html#c14e3]The colonel also described an event witnessed under laboratory conditions:During an official visit by the entire EHP committee, this time to the CleveBackster laboratory, a significant anomalous event occurred while all werewatching. The event was the production of an electromagnetic signal reflectingthe emotional state of a speaker, who was in another room some distance from thesensor. Although there was no direct link-up between the speaker and the sensor,a dramatic and clearly visible shift was recorded. While Hyman found the tracingof interest at the time, no mention of the event appears in the report.4[32_endnote-title.html#c14e4]Statistics is widely used in science whenever there is difficulty separatingsignal from noise. This difficulty is found in physics and chemistry, but it isfound much more often in biology and the social sciences, due to the greaterrandom variability found in living systems. With psi we seem to be dealing withwhat is usually a rather weak effect, and so the statistical analysis of largesamples is necessary to detect it amid all the noise. But parapsychology ishardly unusual in this regard. The link between smoking and lung cancer wasfirst proposed by physicians who noticed that patients who were heavy smokersseemed more likely to contract the disease. But not everyone who smokes getscancer, and not everyone with lung cancer smokes. Statistical analysis of largenumbers of individuals was necessary to conclusively establish the link.A more recent example from biological science is the even weaker link betweenhigh exposure to unusually strong electromagnetic fields and health. An articleis Science reported that “after spending nearly a decade reviewing theliterature on electromagnetic fields (EMFs), a panel of the National Council onRadiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) has produced a draft reportconcluding that some health effects linked to EMFs such as cancer and immunedeficiencies appear real and warrant steps to reduce EMF exposure. . . .Biologists have failed to pinpoint a convincing mechanism of action.”5[32_endnote-title.html#c14e5] In other words, statistics has been used todemonstrate an effect, and biologists are now seeking a mechanism, just as inparapsychology.Finally, Hyman attempts to convince his readers that parapsychological researchis somehow suspect with the following remarks:Parapsychology is the only field of scientific inquiry that does not have evenone exemplar that can be assigned to students with the expectation that theywill observe the original results! . . . This is another way of saying that theother domains of inquiry are based upon robust, lawful phenomena whoseconditions of occurrence can be specified in such a way that even novices willbe able to observe and/or produce them.6 [32_endnote-title.html#c14e6]Relative to an experiment any student can perform, Hyman offers the example ofsplitting a beam of white light into its component colors. But apart from simpleexperiments such as this, students cannot be expected to do a simple experimentand observe the same result regarding a number of well-established phenomena.Examples would include the connection between aspirin and reduced heart attacks,or the connection between smoking and lung cancer.a [38_notes.html#for1] Theproblem with these more complicated phenomena is, of course, that many otherfactors influence the probability of heart disease or cancer, and so the use ofstatistics is necessary to isolate the influence of one factor from among many.Not everyone who smokes will get lung cancer, and not everyone who attempts apsi experiment will obtain positive results. However, in both cases, we canpredict the proportions that will with a high degree of confidence.Parapsychology does have its exemplar experiments, such as the autoganzfeld andthe RNG PK experiments. However, to be reasonably assured of a successfuloutcome in these experiments requires hundreds of trials in the former andthousands of trials in the latter. One can sense the exasperation statisticianJessica Utts must have felt when she wrote:As I have repeatedly tried to explain to Professor Hyman and others, whendealing with a small to medium effect it takes hundreds or sometimes thousandsof trials to establish “statistical significance.” In fact, the PhysiciansHealth Study that initially established the link between taking aspirin andreducing heart attacks studied over 22,000 men. Had it been conducted on only2,200 men with the same reduction in heart attacks, it would not have achievedstatistical significance. Should students be required to recruit 22,000participants and conduct such an experiment before we believe the connectionbetween aspirin and heart attacks is real?7 [32_endnote-title.html#c14e7]At any rate, Hyman’s remarks are now somewhat dated and obsolete. In recentyears, experiments have been designed that can be assigned to students with theexpectation that they will observe the original results. The best examples todayare probably the telepathy experiments designed by Rupert Sheldrake, availableon his website (along with instructions for teachers). These experiments can beperformed with only a handful of participants and completed in less than twentyminutes. In many cases the effects have been robust enough to capture withoutrequiring hundreds or thousands of trials. But thousands of trials have beencompleted, in schools and by private parties, and the results compiled via theInternet. As described on the website, the odds against chance for thesepositive results are quadrillions to one."},{"pageContent":"FIFTEENThe Nature of ScienceArguing over whether an anomaly is pseudo-science, and appealing to science asthe arbiter of truth, serves to make the nature of science a common theme inthese arguments, one about which wide ignorance and confusion are thendisplayed: over whether science is a quest, or the application of a definedmethod, or a body of reliable knowledge; over how reliable scientific knowledgeactually is, especially when laws or theories are applied under novelcircumstances.HENRY BAUER, ARGUMENTS OVER ANOMALIESDebates about the nature of science and about the scientific status ofparapsychology have characterized the history of parapsychology. Since Hyman andother critics have spent so much time and effort questioning the scientificstatus of parapsychology, it seems appropriate here to discuss the nature ofscientific inquiry. But before we examine the philosophical arguments, considerthis brief episode in the history of parapsychology’s struggle for legitimacy.In 1961 the Parapsychological Association (PA) applied for affiliation with theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) but was rejected “ongrounds that at present, parapsychology is not firmly or generally accepted as ascience.”1 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e1] It was rejected again in 1963.The PA applied for membership again in 1969. Just before the votes were cast,the renowned anthropologist Margaret Mead made the following statement:For the last ten years, we have been arguing about what constitutes science andscientific method and what societies use it. We even changed the By-Laws aboutit. The PA uses statistics and blinds, placebos, double blinds and otherstandard devices. The whole history of scientific advance is full of scientistsinvestigating phenomena that the establishment did not believe were there. Isubmit we vote in favor of this Association’s work.2[32_endnote-title.html#c15e2]Following her speech, the membership voted five-to-one in favor of grantingaffiliation. But this was not the end of the struggle. Ten years later,physicist John A. Wheeler launched a campaign to get the PA disaffiliated fromthe AAAS. As part of a speech titled “Drive the Pseudos out of the Workshop ofScience,” Wheeler made the following statement:There is nothing that one can’t research the hell out of. Research guided by badjudgment is a black hole for good money. . . . Now is the time for everyone whobelieves in the Rule of Reason to speak up against pathological science and itspurveyors.”3 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e3]The campaign failed. Parapsychology did not experience any stunningbreakthroughs or notable setbacks between 1961 and 1979, so this brief historyshows that social factors have played an important role in determining therecognition of parapsychology as a science. But philosophers have longcontemplated the nature of science, and we must examine their work to see ifparapsychology qualifies as a science according to rational (as opposed tosociological) criteria.THE NATURE OF SCIENCEIt is generally recognized that science is concerned with theories, but in ascientific context the word theory has a somewhat different meaning than itfrequently does in ordinary conversation: in the latter it is often used looselyto mean any degree of speculation. In police work, for example, it often means aprovisional explanation of what happened in the commission of a crime. Butscientific theories are not meant to be explanations of isolated events: theyare meant to apply to a class of events that are similar in some crucialrespects. So, a scientific theory of crime will not attempt to explain how orwhy a particular crime occurred but will attempt to explain some class ofcrimes.This universal property of scientific theories cannot be stressed enough. Ascientific theory cannot be merely speculation about a particular fact. Theancient Babylonians kept highly precise records of daily observations, and theywere able to use these records to make highly accurate predictions about themovements of heavenly bodies. But the Babylonians did not engage in science;although they gathered facts, they did not propose theories to explain how thesefacts fit together. When Isaac Newton proposed that a planet and the sun areattracted by a gravitational force that is directly proportional to the productof their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance betweenthem, he offered a relation between masses and distances—a relation that ofcourse became celebrated as the Newtonian theory of gravity.a[38_notes.html#five1]But what makes a theory scientific? How do we distinguish between scientific andnonscientific theories? Traditionally, the answer has been that science isdistinguished from pseudoscience, and from metaphysics, by its empirical method,which is essentially inductive: theories are inferred from observations, and inturn these theories are confirmed by further observations.But many theories purport to be based on, and confirmed by, observation.Astrology, for instance, is thought by its supporters to be confirmed byextensive empirical evidence based on observation—on horoscopes and biographicaldata. Should astrology be considered a science? What is the distinction betweentrue science and other forms of belief that purport to be based uponobservation?The celebrated philosopher of science Karl Popper began pondering this questionwhile he was a student in Austria during the early years of the twentiethcentury. As a student, he had been exposed to a lot of the revolutionary newideas that were then gaining wide exposure—most notably Freudian theories ofpsychoanalysis, Adler’s theories of individual psychology, the Marxist theory ofhistory, and Einstein’s theory of relativity.It struck the young Popper how the supporters of Freud’s and Adler’spsychological theories seemed to find confirmation everywhere they looked. Thedata always seemed to fit the theories, and it began to dawn on Popper thatperhaps this fact—that observations always seemed to be consistent with thetheories—might not be their biggest strength, as supporters claimed, but theirgreatest weakness.The situation with Einstein’s theory was different. Here was a theory verydifferent from Newton’s theory in its fundamental outlook, which at that timewas utterly successful. But what really impressed Popper was the way Einsteinused his theory to make a number of bold predictions, all of which could betested. Einstein declared that these predictions were crucial: if the results offuture experiments did not agree with his theoretical calculations, he wouldregard his theory as refuted. One of these predictions was that light would bebent by massive bodies such as the sun to twice the degree predicted by Newton’stheory. In one of the earliest tests of that theory, photographs of stars takenby the Sir Arthur Eddington expedition during an eclipse provided data inagreement with Einstein’s prediction, and contrary to Newton’s.Here seemed to be a crucial difference between relativity and the twopsychological theories: the former took risks in making predictions that couldin principle be wrong. Unlike the theories of Freud and Adler, Einstein’s theorywas incompatible with certain possible results of observations. Or, in otherwords, it could be tested.This consideration led Popper to the conclusion that a theory that is notcapable of being refuted by any possible observation is not truly scientific.One can sum up Popper’s famous demarcation between science and nonscience bysaying that the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is itsfalsifiability.Accordingly, theories that are not falsifiable in principle cannot claim to bescientific, and so they belong to metaphysics, ideology, or pseudoscience.It is important to stress that Popper never thought that metaphysical theorieswere meaningless, or insignificant, or unimportant. They are simply not testablein the way that scientific theories are. Popper actually thought that what Freudand Adler said was of considerable importance, and he hoped that these theoriesmight one day play a role as part of psychological theories that were testable.Metaphysical speculations may inspire programs of scientific research; they alsomay in time become capable of being tested and hence attain scientific status.Ancient examples of metaphysical theories that became testable would include thespeculations of Aristarchus and Copernicus that the earth revolves around thesun; another example would be the theory of Democritus that the world iscomposed of atoms.Popper also noted that the reverse can happen: a theory may start out asscientific, by having testable implications, and then become unscientific byimmunizing itself against apparent examples of falsification. Thus Popper arguedthat Marxism started out as a scientific theory: it predicted that capitalismwould lead to increasing misery among the masses and then be overthrown byrevolution and replaced by socialism; it also predicted that this would occurfirst in the most technologically developed countries. When the so-calledworker’s revolution first occurred in then-backward and agrarian Russia,supporters of the theory did not accept this as a refutation: the theory wassimply modified so that it became immune to falsification.According to this scheme, Freud’s and Adler’s theories were never scientific butbelonged in the realm of protoscientific metaphysics; Marxism started out as ascience but became an ideology; and astrology, insofar as it makes vaguepredictions that are simply irrefutable, belongs to pseudoscience.b[38_notes.html#five2]A few further points are necessary to clarify this picture. One is that somemetaphysical theories may not be directly testable, but they may be implied byscientific theories. They enter into our belief systems on the coattails ofcurrently accepted scientific theories, but if a scientific theory is refuted byobservation, then any metaphysical theories that entered in its wake are alsorefuted. An example of this would be the metaphysical theory of determinismimplied by the clockwork universe of Newtonian physics. If Newtonian physics isrejected as false, then determinism should be rejected as well.Another important point is that Popper’s demarcation between science andnonscience is rough. As mentioned, what was a metaphysical idea yesterday canbecome a testable scientific theory tomorrow. And, of course, some theories aremore testable than others for a variety of reasons: the technology currentlyavailable, the ease with which reliable data may be gathered, or the nature ofthe subject matter. According to Popper, “a theory is scientific to the degreeto which it is testable.”4 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e4] (emphasis added)Finally, it is worth pointing out that Popper was not a simple falsificationistin the manner that many of his critics have assumed:5[32_endnote-title.html#c15e5] He did not think that theories were automaticallyabandoned as soon as they are shown to be false but only when we have a bettertheory available. One theory may be considered better than a competitor in atleast two senses: it may pass tests its competitor fails, and it may explaineverything the other theory explains and more. Popper realized that scienceoften operates as though it aims not at truth but merely at approximations tothe truth. In such circumstances, a theory will not be discarded as soon as itis falsified but only when it is found to approximate the truth less accuratelythan some rival hypothesis.Early in the last century, Popper attended a lecture given by the young AlbertEinstein, and he was greatly impressed. Here was a bold new theory that deviatedin its fundamental outlook from Newton’s, a theory that, up to that time, hadbeen almost entirely and utterly successful in its predictions. (It failed topredict the orbit of Mercury with complete accuracy, but this did not troublemany.) According to Einstein’s theory, Newton’s theory was an excellentapproximation, though false (just as, according to Newton’s theory, Kepler’stheory is an excellent approximation, though false).What really impressed Popper were the following two points: first, Einstein usedhis theory to make several bold predictions, and, second, he declared that ifthe subsequent experiments did not agree with his predictions, he would regardhis theory as refuted. But, as the lecture continued, Einstein went evenfurther, as Popper recounts:Even if they were observed as predicted, Einstein declared that his theory wasfalse: he said that it would be a better approximation to the truth thanNewton’s, but he gave reasons why he would not, even if all predictions came outright, regard it as a true theory. He sketched a number of demands that a truetheory (a unified field theory) would have to satisfy, and declared that histheory was at best an approximation to this so far unattained unified fieldtheory.6 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e6]This lecture led Popper to spend the rest of his life in the philosophy ofscience. Einstein himself spent the rest of his life trying to achieve his dreamof a unified field theory and failed, but the crucial point that Poppereventually concluded from Einstein’s lecture was that truth does not decide thescientific character of a theory—its falsifiability does.c [38_notes.html#five3]THE PROBLEM OF INDUCTION: ARE OUR SCIENTIFIC BELIEFS IRRATIONAL?As mentioned earlier, traditional accounts of science stressed verification ofscientific theories and argued that scientific theories differ fromnonscientific theories in that the former are based on observations, which inturn are verified by further observations. Thus, it was argued that thescientific method is essentially inductive: that is, our scientific laws,expressed as universal laws governing a class of events similar in some crucialrespects, are derived from repeated observations of events of the type inquestion.But as long ago as 1739, the Scottish philosopher David Hume pointed out thatinduction cannot be logically justified. He held that there were no logicalarguments that would allow us to establish “that those instances, of which wehave had no experience, should resemble those, of which we have had experience.”He maintained that we have no logical reason to expect the future to resemblethe past, as “even after the observation of the frequent or constant conjunctionof objects, we have no reason to draw any inference concerning any object beyondthose of which we have had experience.”7 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e7] In otherwords, from the fact that every crow we may have seen so far is black theconclusion that all crows are black does not logically follow. Seeing a whitecrow would not in any sense be a logical contradiction of the earlierobservations.However, Hume of course noticed that people everywhere, including himself,believe in laws and regularities. But if an inductive inference— an inferencefrom repeatedly observed instances to yet unobserved instances—could not bejustified on rational grounds, what could account for its apparent prevalence?Hume concluded that it was nothing more than force of habit. Although there wasno rational justification for induction, Hume believed that it was apsychological fact, and that in any case, people needed induction for their verysurvival. But if this is the case—that all empirical belief is based on nothingmore than habit—then this would imply that all scientific knowledge isirrational.This conclusion greatly distressed Bertrand Russell: he was not willing toabandon the principle of empiricism, which asserts that only observation andexperiment may decide upon the acceptance or rejection of scientific statements,including laws and theories. But he was driven to conclude that if Hume’srejection of the principle of induction is valid, then “every attempt to arriveat general scientific laws from particular observations is fallacious, andHume’s scepticism is inescapable for an empiricist.”8[32_endnote-title.html#c15e8] He wrote that “the rejection of induction makesall expectation as to the future irrational” and that “taking even our firmestexpectations, such as that the sun will rise tomorrow, there is not a shadow ofa reason for supposing them more likely to be verified than not.”9[32_endnote-title.html#c15e9] He writes of Hume, “It is evident that he startedout with a belief that scientific method yields the truth, the whole truth, andnothing but the truth; he ended, however with the conviction that belief isnever rational, since we know nothing.”10 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e10] So, “Itis therefore important to discover whether there is any answer to Hume within aphilosophy that is wholly or mainly empirical. If not, there is no intellectualdifference between sanity and insanity. The lunatic who believes that he is apoached egg is to be condemned solely on the ground that he is in a minority. .. . This is a desperate point of view, and it must be hoped that there is someway of escaping from it.”11 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e11]Russell’s solution is equally desperate: he maintains that “Hume has proved thatpure empiricism is not a sufficient basis for science,” and so allows a singledeparture from his otherwise strictly empirical philosophy, basically concludingthat we simply have no choice but to accept inductive arguments if we are goingto practice science. All we can do, according to Russell, is accept that“induction is an independent logical principle, incapable of being inferredeither from experience or from other logical principles, and that without thisprinciple science is impossible.”12 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e12]Russell’s solution is essentially to accept Hume’s logical refutation ofinduction but then to argue that we must accept it as a principle incapable ofbeing justified by logic or experience, or in other words, simply on faith.Otherwise, “science is impossible” and “there is no intellectual differencebetween sanity and insanity.”Popper’s solution was radically different. He denied that induction was neededin order to practice science: he even denied that humans or animals used anysort of inductive procedure at all, calling it “a kind of optical illusion.”13[32_endnote-title.html#c15e13] As evidence against the reality of induction, heargued that expectations may be formed after only one observed instance; that wemay be born with certain expectations (such as the expectation of being fed);and that long experience may not strengthen our expectations of regularities butrather make us less rigid and dogmatic. Instead of forming our expectations fromobserved regularities, Popper proposed that both humans and animals use a methodof trial and error that only superficially resembles induction but is logicallyvery different.As mentioned, Popper proposed that we all may be born withexpectations—expectations that are psychologically a priori, that is, prior toall observational experience. One of the most important of these expectations isthe expectation of finding regularities.14 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e14] Popperthereby turned the tables on Hume’s psychological theory: instead of explainingour propensity to expect regularities as the result of repetition, he proposedthat we hypothesize repetition as a result of our propensity to expectregularities. In other words, instead of passively waiting for nature to imposeregularities upon us, we actively try to impose regularities upon the world. Wesearch for similarities and try to explain those similarities in terms of lawsinvented by us. These laws may have to be discarded later, should observationsshow that they are wrong. But according to Popper, first we jump to conclusions,and then we test them against observations.This was a theory of trial and error—of conjectures and refutations. It made itpossible to understand why our attempts to force interpretations upon the worldwere logically prior to the observation of similarities. Since there werelogical reasons behind this procedure, I thought that it would apply in thefield of science also; that scientific theories were not the digest ofobservations, but that they were inventions—conjectures boldly put forward fortrial, to be eliminated if they clashed with observations.15[32_endnote-title.html#c15e15]Popper realized that the problem of the irrationality of all human belief,including scientific belief, is solved if we can obtain our knowledge by anoninductive procedure. There is no need to postulate an “inductive principle”;even if we think that induction exists as a psychological fact, there is,according to Popper, no need to attempt to justify the unjustifiable.Hume was right: we are not rationally justified in reasoning from instances ofwhich we have had experience to the truth of the corresponding law. But to thisnegative conclusion Popper added a second: we are justified in reasoning from asingle counterinstance to the falsity of the corresponding law. Consider theuniversal statement “all swans are white.” Hume demonstrated that neither tennor ten thousand observations of white swans logically imply that the next swanwe see will be white. It cannot be verified by any number of observations,because no matter how many white swans we may see, it is logically possible thatthe next swan we see will be black. Yet the universal statement can be falsifiedby the observation of a single black swan.Of course, in practice, we would be most reluctant to accept a singlecounterinstance to a highly successful law: we may question the eyewitnessaccounts, or suspect that the black specimen before us was not really a swan.But this is beside the point: we are logically compelled to reject even the mostsuccessful law the moment we accept a single counterinstance. Empiricalobservation can never verify a theory, but it can decisively refute a theory.Popper demonstrated that science can proceed in a truly deductive manner througha process of conjectures and refutations. As long as we concede that all ourscientific theories are held tentatively, not as “truths” but as conjecturesthat may only be approximations to the truth, then Hume’s dilemma is resolved.They may be falsified by a deductive procedure but never verified in anylogically valid manner. In other words, scientific theories are not verified byobservations consistent with them; rather, they are corroborated by unsuccessfulattempts at refutation.Popper admitted that it took him several years to realize that the problem ofinduction is an aspect of the problem of demarcation between science andnonscience.16 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e16] In fact, his demarcation solves theso-called problem of induction: the problem that, if our scientific beliefs arebased on induction, then they are irrational. Hume’s problem of induction, andPopper’s solution, imply that all our scientific beliefs are not irrational,merely conjectural. Belief would indeed be irrational if by belief we meantuncritical acceptance of our laws based upon attempts to verify them throughrepeated observations. If however, by belief we mean only tentative acceptanceof our scientific theories combined with a willingness to revise them if theyfail to pass crucial tests, then Hume was wrong. There is nothing irrationalabout such acceptance, nor is there anything irrational about relying forpractical purposes upon well-tested theories. There is no more rational courseof action available to us.Hume’s rejection of induction means that our universal laws or theories cannever be proven correct and so must remain only conjectures, or hypotheses. ButPopper’s demonstration of our ability to falsify theories by observation meansthat we can, on purely rational grounds, prefer some competing conjectures toothers. Popper sums it up:To put it in a nutshell, Russell’s desperate remark that if with Hume we rejectall positive induction, “there is no intellectual difference between sanity andinsanity” is mistaken. For the rejection of induction does not prevent us frompreferring, say, Newton’s theory to Kepler’s, or Einstein’s theory to Newton’s:during our rational critical discussion of these theories we may have acceptedthe existence of counterexamples to Kepler’s theory which do not refuteNewton’s, and of counterexamples to Newton’s which do not refute Einstein’s.Given the acceptance of these counterexamples we can say that Kepler’s andNewton’s theories are certainly false; whilst Einstein’s may be true or it maybe false: that we don’t know. Thus there may exist purely intellectualpreferences for one or the other of these the-ories; and we are very far fromhaving to say with Russell that all the difference between science and lunacydisappears. Admittedly, Hume’s argument still stands, and therefore thedifference between a scientist and a lunatic is not that the first bases histheories securely upon observations while the second does not, or anything likethat. Nevertheless we may now see that there may be a difference: it may be thatthe lunatic’s theory is easily refutable by observation, while the scientist’stheory has withstood severe tests.17 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e17]Nor do there seem to be any valid exceptions to the conclusion that in empiricalmatters we can never attain certainty of belief, as Popper reminds us:From the point of view here developed all laws, all theories, remain essentiallytentative, or conjectural, or hypothetical, even when we feel unable to doubtthem any longer. Before a theory has been refuted we can never know in what wayit may have to be modified. That the sun will always rise and set withintwenty-four hours is still proverbial as a law “established by induction beyondreasonable doubt.” It is odd that this example is still in use, though it mayhave served well enough in the days of Aristotle and Pytheas of Massalia—thegreat traveler who for centuries was called a liar because of his tales ofThule, the land of the frozen sea and the midnight sun.18[32_endnote-title.html#c15e18]A few final points are in order. First of all, as mentioned, although no amountof observation can prove a scientific theory, a single counterinstance canfalsify it. But, of course, observations that appear to refute a theory arethemselves fallible. Experiments may not be performed properly, and mistakes maybe made, and there is always the possibility of fraud. But the acceptance of asingle counterinstance logically refutes a universal theory.Secondly, as mentioned earlier, the universal property of scientific theoriescannot be stressed enough. A scientific theory cannot be merely speculationabout a particular fact or an isolated event, because nothing new and nontrivialcan be predicted from such a speculation. This point has to be stressed, becauseit has caused a great deal of confusion among philosophers and historians ofscience. For example, historian and professional “skeptic” Michael Shermer haswritten:Popper’s attempt to solve the problem of demarcation . . . between science andnonscience begins to break down in the borderlands of knowledge. Consider thetheory that extraterrestrial intelligent life exists somewhere in the cosmos. Ifwe find out by making radio contact through the SETI program then the theorywill have been proven absolutely . . . But how could this theory ever befalsified?19 [32_endnote-title.html#c15e19]d [38_notes.html#five4]Shermer’s mistake is his categorization of the statement “extraterrestrialintelligent life exists somewhere in the cosmos” as a scientific theory. It isno such thing. It is merely speculation about a specific fact, from which nonontrivial predictions follow.e [38_notes.html#five5] It is no more a scientifictheory than the statement “there are white swans somewhere on the lake.” Suchstatements about specific factual matters can indeed be confirmed, even proven“beyond all reasonable doubt.” But this is only because they are not universalstatements. Scientific theories are universal statements about how facts fittogether, and from such universal statements follow predictions about specificfacts. So, from the universal statement “all swans are white” follows theprediction that “the next swans we will see on the lake will be white.” Theformer is a (simple) scientific theory; the latter a prediction about a specificfact that follows from the theory, and that may used to test the theory.Note that Shermer would have formulated his idea as a scientific theory if hehad stated it in a universal, testable form, such as: “Life arises quicklywherever there is water and an average temperature above freezing, and given afew billion years, some of this life will become recognizably intelligent.” Thisis a universal statement that relates specific facts to each other, can be usedto make predictions about how much intelligent life exists elsewhere in ourgalaxy, and can be tested (at least in principle) by sending probes to planetsin which conditions for life appear to have been appropriate for a few billionyears. If intelligent life is not found, then the theory is refuted, and it musteither be abandoned or modified.SUMMARY OF POPPER’S PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCEMany consider Popper to be the greatest philosopher of science the twentiethcentury has produced. This is understandable, since his criteria of demarcationbetween science and nonscience is by far the clearest and most logicallyconsistent that has ever been developed. Popper’s ideas have been highlyinfluential among both scientists and philosophers: the list of scientists whohave acknowledged a debt of gratitude to Popper would include Nobel Prizewinners John Eccles and Peter Medawar. Einstein endorsed Popper’s views, and, oflate, Stephen Hawking has taken falsifiability as the defining characteristic ofa scientific theory.According to Popper, the scientific method in its purest form is a method oftrial and error: of conjectures and refutations, of boldly proposing newhypotheses and then subjecting them to the most severe tests possible in anattempt to falsify them. Since induction cannot be rationally justified—noamount of repeated observation can guarantee that a rule inferred from suchrepeated observation is true—it follows that all our scientific theories andlaws are only conjectures, only tentative hypotheses. Popper has shown thatthere is nothing irrational about scientific belief, as long as we realize thatour theories are only conjectures open to revision in the light of new evidence.We can have rational preferences for some beliefs or theories over others: onetheory may be preferred over another because it has passed more severe attemptsat refutation, or because it has more explanatory power.Popper’s principle of falsification as the criterion of scientific theories thusfrees our scientific beliefs from the fallacy of induction and allows us tolearn from our mistakes by providing a means by which false theories may beexpelled from science. The requirement that scientific theories be open tofalsification provides science with a self-corrective mechanism at its verycore."},{"pageContent":"SIXTEENThe Scientific Status of ParapsychologyAccording to Popper’s criterion, the scientific status of parapsychology woulddepend simply upon whether or not the field of parapsychology generates theoriesthat are capable of being falsified in principle. It is to this issue that wenow turn.In fact, there is no shortage of theories of psi. Like many other fields ofinquiry, theories have come and gone as times have changed, but the varioustheories break down into two main groups: the physical theories and thepsychological theories. The physical theories attempt to deal with the problemof how information is mediated between the individual and the environment; thepsychological theories deal with the problem of how psi comes to manifest itselfin the individual’s consciousness in the ways that it does. Most theories havefocused on the issue of mediation, which is understandable: if we have noconceptual grasp of the mediational aspect, the experiential aspect may be moreeasily dismissed as fantasy. So we first turn to the physical theories.PHYSICAL THEORIES OF PSISome of the early researchers, such as J. B. Rhine, were unable to find anyphysical correlates of psi from the cumulative research, and so they concludedthat psi was extraphysical. This view is still shared by some researchers, butmost in recent years have come to the conclusion that the notion of anonphysical psi is more a reaction to classical than contemporary physics. Therehas been a growing recognition that there is no intrinsic incompatibilitybetween psi and the modern laws of physics, and this recognition has spawnedtheories of psi that involve extensions of quantum mechanics.However, before we examine these attempts, it is worth taking a look at some ofthe attempts to explain psi in terms of electromagnetism.ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORIESIn essence, these are extensions of the usual cybernetic model of humanperception, in which information is conveyed to our sense organs by some sort ofcarrier signal (such as sound waves to our ears, light rays to our eyes), whereit travels along nerve cells to our brain, where the message is decoded. If wethen choose to act because of the information received, our brain sends messagesto the muscles. In short, the human organism is portrayed as a receiver anddecoder of information, conveyed by classically understood forms of energy.According to the electromagnetic theories, psi is mediated by some form ofelectromagnetic radiation, and this radiation affects electrical activity in thebrain directly, without going through any recognized sense organ. It isspeculated that patterns of electrical activity in the brain can be bothtransmitted and received; accordingly, PK involves only transmission,clairvoyance only reception, and telepathy functions as a sort of “mentalradio.”There are numerous objections to the electromagnetic theories. If psi ismediated by electromagnetic radiation, then its behavior must be subject to theinverse square law: the intensity of an energetic transmission is inverselyproportional to the square of the distance between transmitter and receiver. Inother words, if the distance between target and percipient is doubled, then thestrength of the signal should be attenuated to a quarter of its originalstrength. But it does not appear that scores in psi experiments decrease withthe square of the distance between target and percipient: successful experimentshave been carried out at great distances, reinforcing the popular notion thatthe operation of psi is independent of distance.a [38_notes.html#six1]Another objection is that screening devices against radiation should block theoperation of psi. But experiments have been carried out using Faraday cagesdesigned to exclude radiation of specific wavelengths. The electromagnetictheories would predict scores only at chance level under these conditions, butthese predictions have not been realized.1 [32_endnote-title.html#c16e1] Thedistinguished Russian physiologist L. L. Vasiliev discussed in his bookExperiments in Distant Influence the attempts of Ferdinando Cazzamalli, BernardKajinsky, and others to explain telepathy in terms of electromagnetic theory.Vasiliev conducted a series of experiments involving telepathic communicationbetween a hypnotist and subjects. During some of these experiments the subjectand hypnotist were placed in metal cabinets, situated in separate rooms, whichshielded against any electromagnetic radiation in the range of ultrashort,short, and medium wavelengths. The subjects were highly successful in respondingto the hypnotist’s suggestions, and the use of metal shielding did not diminishthe results. Even when the hypnotist and the subject were separated by as manyas 1,700 kilometers, the subject was still successful at responding totelepathic suggestions. Vasiliev writes:Contrary to all expectation, screening by metal did not cause any even faintlyperceptible weakening of telepathic transmission. Even under conditions ofdouble screening mental suggestions [telepathy] continued to act with the samedegree of effectiveness as without screening.2 [32_endnote-title.html#c16e2]A final strike against these theories would seem to be the fact that, withcurrent technology at least, the electrical activity of the brain cannot bedetected more than a few millimeters from the scalp. It is difficult to see howthe brain could generate enough electromagnetic radiation to account for psiphenomena at great distances and in spite of radiation shielding. In short, theexperimental evidence appears to leave the electromagnetic theories convincinglyfalsified.THE OBSERVATIONAL THEORIESWe saw in the previous chapter how nothing in quantum mechanics forbids psiphenomena. Costa de Beauregard even maintains that the theory of quantum physicsvirtually demands that psi phenomena exist.3 [32_endnote-title.html#c16e3] NobelLaureate Brian Josephson has written, “If psychic phenomena had not been foundexperimentally, they might have been predicted by an imaginative theoretician.”4[32_endnote-title.html#c16e4]Various modern physicists have gone even further, proposing theories of psibased upon quantum mechanics. One obvious attraction of such theories is thatthey would account for what have been the most problematic features of psi—itsstatistical nature and its seeming independence of space and time. The mostdetailed of these theories so far has been based on the work of theoreticalphysicist Evan Harris Walker. Since Walker’s theory of psi is an extension ofhis quantum mechanical theory of consciousness, it is worthwhile to brieflyreview his and other quantum theories of consciousness.All these theories follow the von Neumann/Wigner interpretation of quantummechanics, which, as the reader may recall, was first formulated by themathematician John von Neumann in opposition to the thenorthodox Copenhageninterpretation. According to quantum theory, the world before observation existsonly as pure possibility; yet when we observe the world at any level we see nota range of possibilities but one actual state of affairs. Something is requiredto collapse the state vectors of pure possibility into one actual result. TheCopenhagen interpretation asserts that the presence of any macroscopic measuringdevice is sufficient to collapse the state vector. But von Neumann, followinghis rigorous mathematical logic wherever it would go, disagreed: the entirephysical world, including measuring devices, must obey the laws of quantumphysics. Something nonphysical, not subject to the laws of quantum mechanics,must account for the collapse of the state vector: the only nonphysical entityin the observation process that von Neumann could think of was the consciousnessof the observer.It is difficult to fault the logic, and decades of experimentation byNobel-hungry physicists eager to knock quantum theory apart has revealed not oneinstance of failure. The results of experiments carried out so far indicate thatnot a single part of the physical world evades the quantum rules. Yet we areaware of one nonphysical entity that carries out observations. Because accordingto quantum theory the world before observation exists only as pure possibility,von Neumann and his followers— most notably London, Bauer, and Wigner—were ledinescapably to the conclusion that it is consciousness (human or otherwise) thatbrings the universe of possibility into actuality.b [38_notes.html#six2]This brings us to the crux of the mind-body problem: What is the relationshipbetween the mind and the brain? The brain is a physical entity and we have noreason to suppose that it evades the rules of quantum physics. In 1924, whenquantum theory was still in its infancy, biologist Alfred Lotkas proposed thedaring conjecture that mind exerts control over the brain by modulating theoccurrence of otherwise random quantum events. Since then, our knowledge of bothquantum mechanics and the brain has increased immeasurably, and today mostquantum models of consciousness place the mechanism of mind-matter interactionat the level of the neural synapse—the tiny gap between the electric tentaclesof the nerve cells.In 1963, Sir John Eccles received the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology fordiscovering how nerve cells communicate with each other: they do it with drugs.The synaptic gap is too wide to be bridged by electrical signals: instead, whena nerve cell is excited, its extremities emit tiny packets of chemicals—calledneurotransmitters—that quickly transverse the gap and cause or inhibit thefiring of adjacent nerve cells. As Nick Herbert writes, “to handle the finedetails of its vast informational traffic, the human brain employs a veritablepharmacy of exotic transmitter substances.”5 [32_endnote-title.html#c16e5] Mostmind-altering drugs achieve their effects by tampering with the transmission ofneurotransmitters, which gives us important clues about theconsciousness-sensitive areas of the brain.Eccles has written about how the firing of just one “critically-poised neuron”could have a cascading effect on activity in the brain, and he speculates thatconsciousness affects brain activity by manipulating the way chemicals arereleased into the synaptic gap. The neural sites where packets of chemicals arereleased are so tiny that quantum uncertainty may govern whether or not therelease mechanisms are activated. Eccles speculates that an immaterial mindcontrols these microsites in one particular part of the brain—the premotorcortex—in order to produce voluntary behavior.We should expect quantum uncertainty to play an even larger role in systemssmaller than this, so other quantum theories of consciousness place the mind’srole in controlling matter at smaller locations near the synaptic gap. Berkeleyphysicist Henry Stapp has developed a model similar to Eccles’s, but he placesthe critical juncture between mind and matter at the level of the calciumion—about a million times smaller than Eccles’s synaptic microsites—andessential for the operation of the synapse. But Evan Harris Walker, who hasdeveloped the most detailed, comprehensive model of quantum consciousness sofar, places the interaction between mind and matter at the level of theelectron—almost 100,000 times less massive than the calcium ion.Briefly, according to Walker’s model, when a synapse is excited, electrons may“tunnel” across the synaptic gap connecting an initiating neuron with itsneighbor, and because of quantum nonlocality, may influence electronscontrolling the firing of distant synapses. Walker postulates the existence of asecond nervous system operating by completely quantum rules, acting in parallelwith the conventional nervous system. The latter handles unconscious dataprocessing, and the former allows an immaterial mind to interact with matter byselecting which second-system quantum possibilities become actualized. In turn,these quantum states act upon the conventional nervous system in order toproduce voluntary action. One advantage of his model is that it helps accountfor the unity of conscious experience we observe despite the fact that the brainactivity associated with even simple perception is spread out over differentparts of the brain.These three theories differ regarding the precise location of mind-matterinteraction, but it should be noted that they are all clearly dualistic, in thesense that they postulate a nonphysical mind that also exerts a real influencein the physical world.c [38_notes.html#six3] As an adherent of the von Neumanninterpretation, Walker believes thatduality is already a part of physics. . . . The dualism enters because“observation” as it is used in quantum theory must have properties that gobeyond those that can be represented in terms of material objects interacting byway of force fields (which is the way all of physics describes physicalprocesses). The reason is that the observer is introduced in QM as a way toaccount for state vector collapse.6 [32_endnote-title.html#c16e6]Brain scientists have generally ignored Walker’s model of consciousness, becauseit contains what are considered by some to be rather unreasonable neurologicalassumptions.d [38_notes.html#six4] Nevertheless, it is the most ambitious anddetailed attempt so far to relate quantum mechanics to the mind-body problem. Incommon with the other models, it is based on the idea that the conscious mindmay bias the collapse of state vectors of quantum phenomena within the brain insuch a way as to influence brain activity in a desired manner. Walker bases histheory of psi upon his theory of consciousness, and in a nutshell it is this:consciousness can collapse state vectors to a single desired outcome inside theperson’s own brain; because of the nonlocal property of quantum phenomena,e[38_notes.html#six5] it can, on occasion, instantaneously affect the state ofanother person’s brain (telepathy), another person’s body (psychic healing), ora distant physical process (PK).Walker’s theory is thus an extension of the original formulation of vonNeumann’s interpretation, in which observation collapses state vectors. VonNeumann’s original formulation implicitly assumed that conscious observation hasno effect on which specific value the quantum phenomena actually take uponobservation—the actual outcome was assumed to be purely random. But we have seenthat the experiments of Helmut Schmidt apparently demonstrate that humanconsciousness can bias the collapse of random quantum systems in a desireddirection. Yet we have also seen that the effect with random event generatorsappears to be weak. Walker speculates that consciousness may exert a strongerinfluence on quantum events within the brain because of its close and intimatelink with this sensitive instrument. This idea seems reasonable. After all, itis hardly surprising that the effect of mind on the fission of atoms in the RNGexperiments is very weak. We should rather wonder why there should be any effectat all. Any such effect must inevitably be greater on biological systems, whichhave presumably evolved to respond to mental influence.Broadly similar theories of psi have been proposed by others, such as HelmutSchmidt, Robert Jahn, and Brenda Dunne, although Walker’s is the most detailedso far. All these theories are referred to as “observational” theories becausethey require observation of results in order for psi to operate. They havesometimes been criticized on the grounds that “observation” is an ambiguousterm. But Walker defines observation simply, writing that “observation is theinteraction of mind with matter” and that “observation is the same as stateselection.” One great advantage of these observational theories is that they areformulated in mathematical terms and thus generate precise predictions that, atleast in principle, are open to testing.f [38_notes.html#six6]EVALUATION OF THE OBSERVATIONAL THEORIESOne of the obvious strengths of the observational theories is that they providesolid explanations of what have been, up until recently, two of the mostpuzzling features of psi: its seeming independence of distance and barriers andits apparently statistical nature. We now know that the universe allows nonlocaleffects, so reports that the operation of psi is unaffected by distance andbarriers can no longer be dismissed as contrary to the known laws of physics.The logically impeccable von Neumann interpretation of quantum mechanics holdsthat events are not fully real until they are observed; the time-displaced PKexperiments support this interpretation and thereby upgrade its status from apurely metaphysical theory to a testable, scientific one. Finally, since,according to the observational theories, psi only operates on otherwise randomphenomena by biasing probabilities, they explain why the operation of psi seemsfundamentally statistical in nature.Theoretical physicists familiar with the experimental evidence from both physicsand parapsychology have constructed the observational theories, all within theframework of a logically valid interpretation of quantum physics. Hyman’sdesperate argument that the acceptance of psi would require that we “abandonrelativity and quantum mechanics in their current formulations”7[32_endnote-title.html#c16e7] is thereby shown to be nonsense. Contrast Hyman’sstatement with that of theoretical physicist Costa de Beauregard, who haswritten that “relativistic quantum mechanics is a conceptual scheme wherephenomena such as psychokinesis or telepathy, far from being irrational, should,on the contrary, be expected as very rational.”8 [32_endnote-title.html#c16e8]We have seen that the observational theories result in numerous predictions,several of which appear to be corroborated by the experimental evidence.Walker’s theory in particular is the most testable theory of psi to come out ofmodern physics. It suggests many possible experiments and makes clearpredictions about what should happen. But acceptance or rejection may take sometime. Applying the theory involves complicated logic and calculation andrequires that some questionable assumptions be made. Having said that, it isfair to say that Walker’s theory is a gallant attempt to explain psi by means ofconcepts consistent with modern physics, and its predictions are consistent tosome degree with much of the experimental evidence. As such, the theory appearsto be a good first approximation to the truth.At any rate, this theory is certainly limited in that it has nothing to sayabout the psychological aspects of psi performance. It is to the psychologicaltheories that we now turn.PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES OF PSIOne advantage of the observational theories is that they are formulated inmathematical terms and thereby generate precise predictions that allow us tochoose between them. But not all phenomena are amenable to quantification. Asmathematician Douglas Stokes has written, “Counting is the basis ofquantification, and counting requires that the entity to be measured be dividedinto discrete units or parts.”9 [32_endnote-title.html#c16e9] So ourreductionist science has proceeded by dissection and up until recently haslargely neglected certain holistic phenomena, such as consciousness. But justbecause physical theories are expressed in mathematical terms does not meanpsychological theories must also be. Bertrand Russell once remarked that ourphysical theories are mathematical not because we know so much but because weknow so little: it is only the world’s mathematical properties that we have beenable to discover.The psychological theories are concerned not with physical mediation but ratherwith the states of mind that are associated with the experience of psi.Accordingly, these theories have been much more inspired by real-lifeexperiences of psi than the physical theories.Many people who have had what they believe to be psi experiences feel thatlaboratory psi is somehow different. In real life, psi experiences tend to beneed-relevant, but what needs are being met by taking part in a psi experiment?The philosopher Henri Bergson and others have proposed that the brain acts as afilter for the mind, filtering out input that is not of immediate survivalvalue. Since psi experiences reported from real life tend to be need-relevantand adaptive, it has been suggested that the reason psi experiences in thelaboratory are usually so weak is because they are evoked by merely findingflaws in Bergson’s filter, rather than by tapping into an ability that may existin order to provide a genuine benefit to the organism. Also, in real life,people usually do not make any effort to use psi: it simply happens. This isquite different from most laboratory psi experiments, in which people are askedto make a conscious effort to use psi.These considerations have led parapsychologist Rex Stanford to formulate a modelin which psi is portrayed as both need-relevant and unintentional. His theory istermed the psi-mediated instrumental response (PMIR) model, and its centraltenet is that psi experiences occur because under certain circumstances theindividual has some need for the experience to occur. The “psi-mediatedresponse” is therefore fundamentally goal-oriented. Stanford further proposesthat the operation of psi is normally unconscious, and it specifically occurs inorder to facilitate some need or desire that has been encoded in memory. ThePMIR model therefore explicitly accommodates nonintentional psi experiences.Stanford has taken pains to formulate his model as a series of propositions thatare designed to be readily testable, such as, “ESP and PK can be used, withoutintention or awareness, to fulfill needs.” Stanford deliberately leaves “needs”undefined; in later writing he uses the term disposition and means this term toinclude not only biological needs but also the more complex wants and desiresarising from life in society.Stanford and Braud have also proposed an explanation for the psi-conducivenature of altered states of consciousness. As discussed earlier, Honorton usedthis apparent feature of altered states to design the ganzfeld experiment.Honorton postulated that psi might operate as a weak signal that is normallymasked by the stronger signals constantly besieging us from our conventionalsense organs. His hypothesis, which became known as the “noise-reduction” modelof psi, was that by reducing ordinary sensory noise while keeping the subjectrelaxed and alert, the subject’s mind would become starved for stimuli and thusmore receptive to any faint signals that ordinarily would not reachconsciousness.But we have seen that the observational theories do not treat psi as a signalbut rather as the influence of observation on otherwise random quantum events.Stanford’s explanation as to why these altered states facilitate psi iscompletely in line with the observational theories. According to Stanford’saccount, the “noise” or data from the outside world imposes a structure upon thebrain and mind when received and interpreted. On the other hand, brains withoutstrongly structured activities are likely to show increasing unpredictabilityand randomness, with the result that psi effects are more likely to occur. SoStanford’s explanation does not treat psi as a weak signal that is normallymasked by noise: rather, the reduction of sensory input leads to a reduction inthe constraints on the activity of the brain, resulting in greater randomnessand hence a greater likelihood of psi effects.EVALUATION AND IMPLICATION OF PSI THEORIESThe physical and psychological theories seek to explain different aspects of thesame phenomena, and they both have their strengths and weaknesses. The physicaltheories explain the independence of distance and barriers, and account for theapparently statistical nature of psi. On the other hand, the PMIR model seemsmore consistent with spontaneous psi experiences, and some of its predictionsalso seem to have passed experimental tests.As discussed above, the physical and psychological theories account fordifferent aspects of the same phenomena, but they are not entirely consistent. Atheory is needed that bridges the psychological and the physical theories. Amore complete theory of psi would include not only a theory of physicalmediation but also details on neurobiology. In addition, it would encompass thepsychological conditions conducive to psi performance. The construction of sucha full-fledged theory is a monumental challenge, requiring an interdisciplinaryapproach among physics, biology, and psychology. But given the twentieth-centuryrevolutions in physics and psychology, and our growing knowledge ofneurobiology, it now appears to be within the reach of a daring theorist.g[38_notes.html#six7]IMPLICATIONS FOR PARAPSYCHOLOGY AS SCIENCEParapsychology meets Popper’s criterion for scientific status, since we haveseen that modern parapsychology does indeed have theories that entailfalsifiable predictions. They are certainly incomplete and only approximatelytrue at best, in the way that Popper would describe all our scientific theoriesas incomplete and only approximately true.h [38_notes.html#six8]In a footnote to the above, Popper illustrates his point with a passage fromHarald Hoffding’s Den menneskelige Tanke (The Humane Reflection): “We have noknowledge going beyond experience; but at no stage are we entitled to look uponexperience as complete. Thus knowledge, even at its highest, provides us withnothing more than a segment of the existing world. Every reality, we may find,is itself again a part of a wider reality.”The criticisms of skeptics such as Martin Gardner and Antony Flew have now beenmet. Gardner has reviewed Walker’s theory, calling it “staggering,” but he thenquotes Sherlock Holmes’s admonition that “theory making should be delayed untilone has data.”10 [32_endnote-title.html#c16e10] Flew, on the other hand, writingyears later, protests that we should be very suspicious of the data supportingthe existence of psi because “no one has been able to think up any halfwayplausible theory accounting for the occurrence of any psi-phenomenon.”11[32_endnote-title.html#c16e11] Flew never once mentions any of the proposedtheories of psi, but instead he writes that “a plausible theory relating theseputative phenomena to something that undoubtedly does occur would tend both toexplain and to make probable their actual occurrence.” He then goes on to quotea maxim attributed to Sir Arthur Eddington: “It is a good rule not to putovermuch confidence in the observational results until they are confirmed bytheory.”12 [32_endnote-title.html#c16e12] i [38_notes.html#six9] j[38_notes.html#six10]Flew protests that “this should not seem a lapse into anti-empiricist a prioridogmatism,” although that is exactly what it is. Meteorites, continental drift,and the energy source of the stars only recently found theoretical explanations;yet for millennia the stones fell, the continents moved, and the stars went onshining, all completely indifferent to our lack of understanding. The universeis not held hostage by our ignorance.And as Walker reminds Gardner:The data are there for those who have availed themselves of the facts—the factsof physics and the data of parapsychology. QM is well understood by thoseeducated in physics, and psi phenomena have been elucidated in a thousandexperiments. The only thing that has been lacking is a rapprochement betweenparapsychology and the main body of science.13 [32_endnote-title.html#c16e13]That is what the physical and psychological theories provide. Like meteorites,continental drift, the stars, and countless other phenomena, psi phenomena alsohad to wait for science to develop to the point where it was capable ofproviding a tentative explanation."},{"pageContent":"SEVENTEENHume’s Argument RevisitedThere is no such thing as the supernatural; these are only phenomena we do notyet understand.KATHLEEN SKY, SCIENCE FICTION WRITERWe are now in a position to properly evaluate the famous skeptical argument ofDavid Hume, an argument that has been used by skeptics over and over again todismiss the existence of psi as highly unlikely on a priori grounds.1[32_endnote-title.html#c17e1] But in order to do so, it will be helpful to firstreview the intellectual climate of the eighteenth century in which Hume wrote.It must have seemed to be a tremendously exciting time, as though wondrous newvistas were opening up for the human race because of the work of scientists suchas Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. The horrors of the religious wars and of theInquisition were still fresh in people’s minds, and the new scientificworldview, spread by people such as Diderot and Voltaire, can be seen partly asa reaction against the ecclesiastical domination over thought that the Churchheld for centuries. In 1600, Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for, amongother things, the heresy of expressing belief in the heliocentric theory ofCopernicus. It is therefore not surprising that, when Galileo fell into thehands of the Inquisition sixteen years later, he played it safe and recanted.But when Newton’s Principia was published in 1687, it was not suppressed butinstead reached a wide audience. The Newtonian system predicted the orbits ofthe planets with astonishing accuracy, and even reduced comets from portents ofdisaster to phenomena whose appearance in the sky could be predicted likeclockwork. The scientific revolution of the seventeenth century completelytransformed the outlook of educated people, so that by 1700 their outlook was nolonger medieval but completely modern.a [38_notes.html#seven1] By this time thepicture of a mechanistic universe governed by inviolable laws had establishedits hold on the imaginations of educated men and women; now such things asmagic, sorcery, and second sight seemed incredible at best, and vulgarsuperstition at worse. The new scientific worldview had given birth to adistinction between the “natural” and the “supernatural,” between the “normal”and the “paranormal,” a distinction that, for better or worse, persists to thisday.b [38_notes.html#seven2]Popper describes the atmosphere of Hume’s time:It is perhaps hard for intellectuals of our own day, spoilt and blasé as we areby the spectacle of scientific success, to realize what Newton’s theory meantfor any eighteenth-century thinker. After the unmatched daring with which theAncients had tackled the riddle of the Universe there had come long periods ofdecay and recovery, and then a staggering success. Newton had discovered thelong sought secret. . . . No qualified judge of the situation could doubt anylonger that Newton’s theory was true. It had been tested by the most precisemeasurements, and it had always been right. It had led to the prediction ofminute deviations from Kepler’s laws, and to new discoveries. In a time likeours, when theories come and go like the buses in Piccadilly, and when everyschoolboy has heard that Newton has long been superseded by Einstein, it is hardto recapture the sense of conviction which Newton’s theory inspired, or thesense of elation, and of liberation. A unique event had happened in the historyof thought, one which could never be repeated: the first and final discovery ofthe absolute truth about the universe. An ageold dream had come true. Mankindhad obtained knowledge, real, certain, indubitable, and demonstratableknowledge—divine scientia or episteme, and not merely doxa, human opinion.2[32_endnote-title.html#c17e2]Of course, as discussed earlier, we now know that Newton’s system is not certainand indubitable but also merely doxa. But this was the intellectual atmosphereof the eighteenth century in which Hume wrote his famous Inquiry ConcerningHuman Understanding. It was G. R. Price who, back in 1955, made the firstattempt to deploy Hume’s skeptical argument as a challenge to the existence ofpsi phenomena:Now it happens that I myself believed in ESP about 15 years ago, after readingExtra-Sensory Perception after Sixty Years, but I changed my mind when I becameacquainted with the argument presented by David Hume in his chapter “OfMiracles” in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding.3[32_endnote-title.html#c17e3]Price then goes on to quote Hume’s now famous argument: “A miracle is aviolation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable experience hasestablished these laws, the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of thefact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined.”Modern skeptics still use this argument to say that the existence of psi shouldbe rejected in a like manner because it conflicts with what normal science takesto be the laws of nature. For instance, we have the philosopher Antony Flew,almost thirty-five years after Price, repeating Hume’s argument, along withcomplaining of Price that “he had not appreciated the full richness and strengthof the argument suggested by Hume” and that “so far, no one seems to haveappreciated the full significance for parapsychology of Hume’s argument.”4[32_endnote-title.html#c17e4] Flew criticizes Price for being too soft on theparapsychologists with Price’s insistence that “what is needed is one completelyconvincing experiment—just one experiment that does not have to be acceptedsimply on the basis of faith in human honesty.” Like Price, Flew defends thevalidity of Broad’s Basic Limiting Principles, but Flew demands a repeatableexperiment:Any supposedly once-and-for-all decisive yet not-in-practicerepeatabledemonstration of the reality of psi phenomena has to be rejected. It has to berejected in the same emphatic way, and for the same excellent reasons, thatcritical historians reject stories of what they know, or believe they know, tobe physically (or practically or contingently) impossible. So to the objectionthat there are some rare phenomena that, though not repeatable at will, areadmitted by science, the correct and crushing reply should be that these are notphenomena for which we have the strongest or indeed any very good reasons forthinking impossible.5 [32_endnote-title.html#c17e5]Presumably Flew would have been among those rejecting the existence ofmeteorites and continental drift as “impossible.” Be that as it may, let usexamine Hume’s argument as it appears in Section X of his 1748 Inquiry. Humebegins by writing that “I flatter myself that I have discovered an argument of anature which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting checkto all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently will be useful as longas the world endures.” He then argues very reasonably that “though experience beour only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact, it must be acknowledgedthat this guide is not altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to leadus into errors.” He considers cases in which the evidence seems contradictory,and he asserts that in such cases a wise man proceeds with caution and“proportions his belief to the evidence.” And if we suppose “that the fact whichthe testimony endeavors to establish partakes of the extraordinary and themarvelous—in that case the evidence resulting from the testimony admits of adiminution, greater or less in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual.”However, if the testimony of witnesses is in favor of a fact that is notmarvelous but truly miraculous, then the situation for Hume becomes verydifferent. It is at this point that Hume asserts that “a miracle is a violationof the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable experience has establishedthese laws, the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is asentire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined.” Hume was awarethat miraculous events were being reported even in his own day, but, like thegood philosopher he was, he did not try to make things easy for himself by onlychallenging reports that were easy to discredit. He was aware, for instance,that shortly before his writing several miracles, mostly concerned with healing,had been reported in Paris, then the undisputed cultural capital of the world.They were all connected with the tomb of François de Paris, the reveredJansenist priest who had been buried in the cemetery of St. Medard.François, as being a Jansenist, was considered a heretic in the eyes of theChurch. Reports of healing miracles at his tomb were therefore considered anembarrassment, which led to an effort by the Jesuits and the authorities todiscredit them at all costs; when this effort failed, the authorities simplyclosed down the cemetery. Hume discusses the reports of these miracles andwrites:But what is more extraordinary, many of the miracles were immediately provedupon the spot, before judges of unquestioned integrity, attested by witnesses ofcredit and distinction, in a learned age, and on the most eminent theater thatis now in the world. Nor is this all: a relation of them was published anddispersed everywhere, nor were the Jesuits, though a learned body supported bythe civil magistrate, and determined enemies to those opinions in whose favorthe miracles were said to have been wrought, ever able distinctly to refute ordetect them. Where shall we find such a number of circumstances agreeing to thecorroboration of one fact? And what have we to oppose such a cloud of witnessesbut the absolute impossibility or miraculous nature of the events which theyrelate? And this, surely, in the eyes of all reasonable people, will alone beregarded as a sufficient refutation.6 [32_endnote-title.html#c17e6] (emphasisadded)PROBLEMS WITH HUME’S VIEWIt may have occurred by now to the astute reader that there is a conflictbetween Hume’s skepticism regarding universal laws and his rejection of anysupposed “violations” of these laws. There is no question that Hume’s refutationof the validity of belief based on repeated observation had devastatingimplications. As Popper so colorfully described it, the eighteenth century was atime when educated people believed they were living in an era that had witnessed“the first and final discovery of the absolute truth about the universe”; thatmankind had at last “obtained knowledge, real, certain, indubitable.” But as wehave seen, Hume had taught that there could be no such thing as certainknowledge of universal laws, that all we knew was obtained by the observation ofsingular instances, so that all of our universal laws were uncertain. Given hisearlier expressed skeptical views about the rationality of belief based onobservation, he has no right to claim rational support for the “laws of nature.”In practice, he cannot maintain his rigorous skepticism, and he argues as thoughthe scientific laws of his time were known with certainty, much as many of hiscontemporaries would have argued. If he is going to be perfectly consistent,then he must maintain that when we assert a law of nature, we are really onlyexpressing a habit of association based upon previous observations.Nevertheless, he plainly thinks—or at the very least writes as though hethinks—that the laws of nature are correct and complete and are not merelyhabits of association that cannot be rationally justified. In this respect, heseems in his essay “On Miracles” to be very much a typical educated man of histimes.c [38_notes.html#seven3]So the force of Hume’s argument rests on the assumption that we know the laws ofnature with virtual certainty and so can reject any reported “violation” on apriori grounds. But Popper has shown that “Hume’s negative result establishesfor good that all our universal laws or theories remain forever guesses,conjectures, hypotheses.”7 [32_endnote-title.html#c17e7] Although psi may beincompatible with the Newtonian model that was so well entrenched in Hume’stime, with the benefit of hindsight we now realize that Newton’s model is only amarvelous conjecture, an excellent approximation. As we have seen, there is noreason to think that the existence of psi is incompatible with our modern lawsof physics (except perhaps for macro-PK). Indeed, we have seen that some of theleading theories of psi are not only compatible with known scientific principlesbut are expressly written in terms of them.In short, Hume’s skeptical argument, applied to the existence of psi phenomena,rests on two assumptions that we have dealt with earlier: that our “laws ofnature” are known to be correct and complete and that the existence of psi wouldnecessarily conflict with them. With the benefit of almost three centuries ofhindsight, we can now see that, in the context of the eighteenth century, Hume’sargument was wrong on the first count but correct on the second. However, thelaws of nature as Hume understood them are now long obsolete, and so is hisskeptical argument.Obviously, it is a good rule of common sense that our acceptance of highlyunusual or statistically improbable claims should require more carefulinvestigation than we would apply to claims regarding more mundane occurrences.Otherwise, we would uncritically accept the tabloid headings we read whenstanding in line at the supermarket (“Space Alien Baby Found!”). And even todaythe dangers of irrationality and fanaticism that Hume was concerned with stillexist, including the danger of blindly accepting accounts of miraculous eventsby those attempting to promote a new religion or maintain an old one. But Hume’sargument breaks down where he draws a distinction between events that are merelyunusual and those that are “violations of the laws of nature,” with the formerwarranting careful investigation before being accepted as genuine and the latterdeserving only dismissal on the grounds that they are simply “impossible.” Humeobviously does not have our benefit of seeing in hindsight that the laws ofnature are not written in stone and have changed profoundly since his time. Butregardless of the fact that the existence of psi is far more compatible with thecurrent “laws of nature”d [38_notes.html#seven4] than the laws of Hume’s time,there is of course the constant danger of thinking that one knows the laws ofnature with certainty and of rejecting contrary evidence as unscientific. If allscientists did in fact behave the way Hume expected them to, science would longago have congealed into dogma, and outmoded theories would never have beenoverthrown and replaced."},{"pageContent":"EIGHTEENParadigms and ParapsychologyAs briefly discussed earlier, the historian of science Thomas Kuhn has advancedthe thesis that science progresses with the discovery of anomalies, or findingsthat are not predicted or explained by a currently accepted theory, which hecalled a paradigm. According to Kuhn, most scientists spend their careers tryingto extend and refine the dominant paradigm of their field. When anomaliesinevitably appear, they may at first be ignored. But eventually attempts aremade to extend or refine the paradigm in order to accommodate the puzzlingphenomenon. Most of the time this “puzzle solving” is successful, and theextension and refinement of the paradigm continues.However, Kuhn thought that paradigms inevitably encounter awkward facts thatresist explanation. As resistant anomalies continue to accumulate, moreresources and talent are recruited in an increasingly desperate attempt toassimilate these awkward facts into the dominant paradigm. A crisis ensues andis only resolved when a rival paradigm is accepted that accommodates thetroubling new findings as well as those phenomena explained by the currentchampion. The new paradigm is typically resisted at first, but eventually itwins over a majority of scientists and in turn becomes the orthodox viewpoint.At that point, the revolution is over, and most scientists return to spendingtheir time trying to extend and refine the new paradigm, or as Kuhn would putit, to “solving puzzles.” As long as there seem to be no serious challenges tothe validity of the paradigm, its truth is simply not questioned. Kuhn referredto the periods between revolutions as “normal science” and thought that itconsisted mostly of a routine of solving minor problems that do not threatenacceptance of the theory.There does seem to be some truth to Kuhn’s theory of scientific progress. Therehave certainly been anomalies in Kuhn’s sense that have resisted explanationuntil the advent of a new theory. Writing in 1934, C. P. Snow described thesudden success of quantum mechanics in 1925, stating that “anomalies ceased tobe anomalies, with this new clue; facts which had puzzled us before now fittedin completely.”1 [32_endnote-title.html#c18e1]But critics have pointed out that many historical cases do not fit Kuhn’s model:there have been anomalies, such as x-rays, that did not create crisis, and therehave been revolutions that were not dependent on anomalies and crisis.2[32_endnote-title.html#c18e2]Another weakness of Kuhn’s work is the number of ways paradigm is defined: as ascientific theory, a successful experiment, a metaphysical view of reality, ashared vocabulary, and so on. As Dudley Shapere has written, “The truth of thethesis that shared paradigms are the common factors guiding scientific researchappears to be guaranteed, not so much by a close examination of actualhistorical cases, as by the breadth of definition of the term ‘paradigm.’”3[32_endnote-title.html#c18e3] Another critic has classified twenty-one differentdefinitions of the word paradigm as used by Kuhn.4 [32_endnote-title.html#c18e4]Nevertheless, the views of Thomas Kuhn are often thought to be highly relevantto parapsychology’s struggle to gain recognition. It is thought that psiphenomena constitute genuine anomalies and that the resistance of the skepticsis due to a perceived threat to the currently dominant paradigms of modernscience.But the notion of anomalies, or “violations of expectation,” is, as Kuhn pointedout, a sociological notion as much as it might be a logical one. Obviously, ifour expectations differ, then so will our classification of anomalies. We havealready seen that several contemporary physicists believe that quantummechanical theory implies the existence of psi phenomena, so their expectationsare obviously not violated by the reports. Since there is no longer anynecessary conflict on a theoretical level between psi research and physics,describing psi phenomena as “anomalous” no longer seems to explain very much.The multiple ways in which the term paradigm is used also weakens theexplanatory power of Kuhn’s thesis. However, if by paradigm we mean ametaphysical theory, then perhaps psi research is helping bring about a paradigmchange in the scientific worldview. There is an emerging metaphysical (and tothe degree it is testable, scientific) theory that treats consciousness ashaving causal efficacy and genuine explanatory power in the universe. This isall we could really mean when we say that psi research may contribute to a newparadigm. Walker wrote in 1984 that “with the exception of parapsychology, thesignificance and central nature of consciousness has been omitted fromscience.”5 [32_endnote-title.html#c18e5] This remark is now somewhat dated, asthere has been an explosion of new scientific research regarding the phenomenonof consciousness in recent years. Unfortunately, like most of the philosophicalwork on consciousness, much of it has been carried out within a materialistic,mechanistic framework of assumptions, in fretful ignorance and disdain of thecontributions of quantum mechanics and psi research.a [38_notes.html#eit1]There is another important sense, though, in which Kuhn’s work has relevance toparapsychology’s struggle for recognition and acceptance. It involves Kuhn’sconception of what he called “normal science.” Kuhn thought that the history ofscience could be separated into “normal” periods” and “revolutionary” periods,with the former characterized by a routine of puzzle solving, in which the truthof prevailing theories is simply not questioned. Theories are treated as thoughthey are known to be correct, and new entrants into the field are taught theorthodox theories as if they were reality. Kuhn referred to the period betweenrevolutions as “normal science” because he had concluded that this was the normfor most scientists most of the time.Although Popper rejected much of Kuhn’s thesis, he did admit that Kuhn’s conceptof “normal science” was valuable as a warning because it was unfortunately trueof the way science has come to be practiced in some laboratories anduniversities. However, according to Popper, this was neither “normal” nor was itscience, and should it ever become routine practice it would signal the end ofscience. Popper stressed that the best scientists (such as Bohr in 1913 andEinstein in 1916) realize the tentative nature of their theories and expect thattheir theories will be superseded in time.Kuhn was primarily concerned about the cultural distinction between science andnonscience, whereas Popper was committed to identifying the underlying logicaldistinction. Popper even insisted that it would be a major disaster for humanityif we were to accept “the replacement of a rational criterion of science by asociological one.”6 [32_endnote-title.html#c18e6]Clearly, then, Popper’s demarcation criterion between science and nonscience isthe most coherent ever developed. Kuhn’s contribution to Popper’s viewpoint isprimarily his sociological description of “normal science” and its oftendogmatic nature. In the absence of serious challenges, Kuhn thought that “normalscience” meant the practice and teaching of science as though it were simplydogma. Unfortunately, it is often true that scientific theories are taught asthough they were reality, not merely tentative models of reality.CONCLUSIONSKuhn’s description of “normal” science and his historical accounts of theresistance of many scientists to new ideas do show how scientific andmetaphysical beliefs can be clung to with near-religious tenacity. This desirefor certainty and finality partly explains the dogmatism of some skeptics of psiphenomena.We have already seen how the psychologist Hebb rejected psi on a priori grounds:Why do we not accept ESP as a psychological fact? Rhine has offered enoughevidence to have convinced us on almost any other issue. . . . Personally, I donot accept ESP for a moment, because it does not make sense. . . . I cannot seewhat other basis my colleagues have for rejecting it. . . . Rhine may still turnout to be right, improbable as I think that is, and my own rejection of his viewis—in the literal sense—prejudice.7 [32_endnote-title.html#c18e7]We have also seen the following remark by the physiologist Helmholtz:I cannot believe it. Neither the testimony of all the Fellows of the RoyalSociety, nor even the evidence of my own senses, would lead me to believe in thetransmission of thought from one person to another independently of therecognized channels of sense. It is clearly impossible.8[32_endnote-title.html#c18e8]But such closed-minded thought processes are by no means confined to thereaction of scientists to the existence of psi. Physicist Albert Michelson wrotethe following twenty years after his crucial experiment on the velocity oflight, which led to the downfall of Newtonian mechanics and the eventualacceptance of the special theory of relativity:The more important fundamental laws and facts of the physical universe have allbeen discovered and these are now so firmly entrenched that the possibility oftheir ever being supplanted in consequence of new discoveries is exceedinglyremote.9 [32_endnote-title.html#c18e9]Michelson admitted that there were “apparent exceptions,” but thought that theknown physical laws would be sufficient to deal with them. These statements ofhis shortly preceded Einstein’s paper on special relativity and the developmentof quantum mechanics.A central theme of this book is that this debate is not primarily aboutevidence, but about frameworks of understanding—or, to be precise, aboutscientific and philosophical assumptions that cannot accommodate the reality ofpsi. One hundred years ago classical physics was widely assumed—withcertainty—to be correct and complete. The dogmatism of the current skeptics is,in part, a legacy of this outmoded science, whose implications are contradictedby the existence of psi. It is also a product of the ideology of secularhumanism, which rests on the metaphysical implications of classical physics andhas an antireligious, antisuperstitious agenda. The secular humanists and othermaterialists correctly realize that the findings of psi research threaten theirmaterialist beliefs. George Hansen has written that, in the minds of manymembers of the public, “The paranormal/supernatural is intimately associatedwith the sacred. Many debunkers seem to understand that fact, and it is noaccident that CSI is thoroughly tied to anti-religious, rationalist, andatheistic groups.”10 [32_endnote-title.html#c18e10]We have seen how leading “skeptic” and CSI member James Alcock has written that“in the name of religion human beings have committed genocide, toppled thrones,built gargantuan shrines, practiced ritual murder, forced others to conform totheir way of life, eschewed the pleasures of the flesh, flagellated themselves .. .” But we can just as easily find examples of atrocities committed in the nameof ideology, which I define as a nonreligious, faith-based belief system thatmotivates a social agenda. Consider the misery inflected upon millions in thetwentieth century by the ideologies of fascism and communism. Turning from onefaith-based belief system to another is unlikely to solve the problem offanaticism.It seems contrary to human nature to readily adopt Popper’s ideal of holding ourbeliefs only as tentative conjectures, capable of being revised if they areshown to be false.b [38_notes.html#eit2] Remember that most of our greatdestructive wars have been wars of religion or ideology. If religions andideologies can compel humans to fight and die for them, then it should not besurprising that scientific theories and the worldviews they spawn should oftenbe clung to with the same dogmatic tenacity. It seems reasonable to speculatethat the factors inclining an individual toward scientific fundamentalism aresimilar to those factors inclining an individual toward religiousfundamentalism: a desire for certainty in a world that often appearscomplicated, confusing, and full of ambiguity.Arrogance is one of the worst diseases of scientists and it gives rise tostatements of authority and finality which are expressed usually in fields thatare completely beyond the scientific competence of the dogmatist. It isimportant to realize that dogmatism has now become a disease of scientistsrather than of theologians.JOHN ECCLESSusan Blackmore has been remarkably candid about her own struggle againstdogmatic thinking, writing, as we saw earlier:Human beings are not built to have open minds. If they try to have open mindsthey experience cognitive dissonance. Leon Festinger first used this term. Heargued that people strive to make their beliefs and actions consistent and whenthere is inconsistency they experience this unpleasant state of “cognitivedissonance,” and they then use lots of ploys to reduce it. I have to admit Ihave become rather familiar with some of them.11 [32_endnote-title.html#c18e11]Blackmore entered the field of psi as a fervent believer in psi, out-of-bodyexperiences, the tarot, and the occult. She describes how it all began in herstudent days:I became hooked on the subject when I first went up to Oxford to read physiologyand psychology. I began running the Oxford University Society for PsychicalResearch (OUSPR), finding witches, druids, psychics, clairvoyants, and even afew real live psychical researchers to come to talk to us. We had Ouija boardsessions, went exploring in graveyards, and did some experiments on ESP andpsychokinesis.Within a few weeks I had not only learned a lot about the occult and theparanormal, but I had an experience that was to have a lasting effect on me—anout-of-body experience.12 [32_endnote-title.html#c18e12]She writes in her autobiography that she “had always wanted to be a ‘famousparapsychologist.’”13 [32_endnote-title.html#c18e13] She began to performexperiments, yet concluded that most of these had been failures. Describing theeffect these perceived failures had on her state of mind, Blackmore writes:I found myself simply not believing in psi anymore. I really had become adisbeliever. Like one of those doors with a heavy spring that keeps it closed,my mind seemed to have changed from closed belief to closed disbelief.14[32_endnote-title.html#c18e14]Professor Henry Bauer has written on arguments over anomalous phenomena withconsiderable insight into the psychology of those holding extreme positions:In the rare cases when true believers do happen to recognize their error, theydo not then adopt a more balanced or judicious stance, rather they typically goto the other extreme. Arthur Koestler’s disillusionment with Communism left himimplacably anti-Communist; Whittaker Chambers coupled that shift with conversionfrom atheism to Catholicism. Maurice Burton gave credence to the Loch Nessmonsters for nearly three decades and then became a determined debunker; Razdanand Keiler (1984–1985) became injudiciously critical after their own search forthe monster was unsuccessful. The switch from believer to debunker is easierthan from either of those stances to uncommitted, because the extreme positionsare so similar to one another, psychologically and (il)logically. Thus, the[true] believers and the debunkers are equally dogmatic.15[32_endnote-title.html#c18e15]Blackmore went from one extreme to the other, but, as we saw earlier, holdingthe opposite extreme position was also difficult. She still had to face the factthat others were reporting positive results. One day she was asked to witness atelepathy experiment involving children:We observed for some time, and the children did very well. They really seemed tobe getting the right picture more often than chance would predict. I began toget excited; even frightened. Was this really ESP happening right in front of myeyes? Or was there an alternative explanation? . . . Somehow I just couldn’taccept that this was psi, and I was to go on arguing about the method used infuture years. Was it just perversity? A refusal to accept my own failures? Adeep fear of psi? Whatever it was, it led me into constant confusion. I justdidn’t seem able to accept that other people could find psi while I could not.16[32_endnote-title.html#c18e16]Finally, she experienced what was, to her, an epiphany:Now I realized, as though I had never realized it before, that sometimes youcan’t know. And you don’t have to know. You don’t have to be able to remembereverything. You don’t have to understand everything. I just didn’t know: thismental construction of a self didn’t know some things.17[32_endnote-title.html#c18e17]The inability to tolerate uncertainty, to think of our beliefs as merelyconjectures, seems to be deeply embedded in the nature of at least some of theskeptics (and almost surely in the nature of the uncritical “true believers”).At any rate, Blackmore claims to have officially retired from parapsychology,complaining that “I am just too tired—and tired above all of working to maintainan open mind.”It seems fitting to conclude this book with a quote from Charles Honorton,pioneer of the ganzfeld experiments. Shortly before his death at age forty-sixin 1992, Honorton wrote his classic article on skepticism, “Rhetoric overSubstance,” which he concluded with these words:I believe in science, and I am confident that a science that can boldlycontemplate the origin of the universe, the nature of reality 10–33 secondsafter the Big Bang, anthropic principles, quantum nonlocality, and paralleluniverses, can come to terms with the implications of parapsychologicalfindings—whatever they may turn out to be. There is no danger for science inhonestly confronting these issues; it can only be enriched by doing so. Butthere is a danger for science in encouraging self-appointed protectors whoengage in polemical campaigns that distort and misrepresent serious researchefforts. Such campaigns are not only counterproductive, they threaten to corruptthe spirit and function of science and raise doubts about its credibility. Thedistorted history, logical contradictions, and factual omissions exhibited inthe arguments of the critics represent neither scholarly criticism norskepticism, but rather counteradvocacy masquerading as skepticism. Trueskepticism involves the suspension of belief, not disbelief. In this context wewould do well to recall the words of the great nineteenth century naturalist andskeptic, Thomas Huxley: “Sit down before fact like a little child, be preparedto give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly to wherever and to whateverabysses nature leads, or you shall learn nothing.”"},{"pageContent":"PostscriptThis book was conceived by accident. One day, while living in the San FranciscoBay area, I stumbled across a website devoted to debunking the belief in anafterlife. Having read several serious books on the subject, I was shocked bythe crudity of the author’s arguments and by his utter ignorance of the vastamount of research that has been done on the topic over the past 125 years. Isent him an e-mail message, trying to get him to reconsider his dogmaticposition, and, to my surprise, he responded with counterarguments. For the nextfew weeks, we engaged in a debate via e-mail, and I learned much about theso-called “skeptical” mind-set. I realized that it was based upon a certain setof metaphysical assumptions that were not treated as assumptions but asincontrovertible facts; and that it was also based upon an ignorance of certainfacts that cast strong doubt on the validity of those assumptions.I also realized that nothing I could possibly say would ever change his“skeptical” opinion. He had made up his mind, and that was that.However, his opinions seemed common among a large minority of the educatedpublic, and were expressed—sometimes with the same vehemence—in scores of booksand in at least one periodical. I came to the conclusion that this viewpoint wasfundamentally flawed and that a book was needed to directly challenge thesebiased, prejudiced opinions on the existence of psi, and on the survivalhypothesis: the idea that we survive the death of our bodies.Alas, the task turned out to be larger than I had anticipated. The final productwas mammoth-sized, and no publisher would print it all in one book. What hadoriginally been planned as one book turned into a trilogy. You have just readthe first in that trilogy, originally published in 2007 under the titleParapsychology and the Skeptics.The next book, Science and the Near Death Experience, deals with the ancient andmodern evidence for the survival hypothesis that has been gathered fromnear-death experiences and carefully considers the skeptical objections."},{"pageContent":"FootnotesIntroductiona [08_introduction-title.html#r1]. However, as late as 1807, Thomas Jefferson,as president of the American Philosophical Society, reacted to the theorypropounded by two New England astronomers that a meteorite, found in Weston,Connecticut, was of extraterrestrial origin, by remarking, “I could more easilybelieve that two Yankee professors would lie than stones would fall fromheaven.”b [08_introduction-title.html#r2]. It is stated in the Report of the Experimentson Animal Magnetism, made by a Committee of the Medical Section of the FrenchRoyal Academy of Sciences in 1831: “We have seen two somnambulists whodistinguished, with their eyes closed, the objects which were placed beforethem; they mentioned the color and the value of cards, without touching them;they read words traced with the hand, as also some lines of books opened atrandom. This phenomenon took place even when the eyelids were kept exactlyclosed with the fingers.”c [08_introduction-title.html#r3]. Bellachini’s statement read: “After I had, atthe wish of several highly-esteemed gentlemen of rank and position, and also formy own interest, tested the physical mediumship of Mr Slade in a series ofsittings by full daylight, as well as in the evening, in his bedroom, I must,for the sake of truth, hereby certify that the phenomenal occurrences with MrSlade have been thoroughly examined by me with the minutest observation andinvestigation of his surroundings, including the table, and that I have not inthe smallest degree found anything to be produced by means of prestidigitativemanifestations, or by mechanical apparatus; and that any explanation of theexperiments which took place under the circumstances then obtaining by anyreference to prestidigitation, to be absolutely impossible. I must rest with such men of science as Crookes and Wallace, in London;Perty, in Berne; Butlerof, in St Petersburg; to search for the explanation ofthis phenomenal power, and to prove its reality. I declare, moreover, thepublished opinions of laymen, as to the ‘How’ of this subject to be premature,and according to my view and experience, false and one-sided. This, mydeclaration, is signed and executed before a notary and witnesses.” [signed]Samuel Bellachini \\ Berlin, 6 December, 1877.d [08_introduction-title.html#r4]. Slade’s and Zollner’s story after this is nota happy one. Zollner died in 1882 from a brain hemorrhage. Three years laterSlade arrived in Philadelphia to be examined by the Seybert Commission, createdunder the terms of the will of Henry Seybert to make an impartial assessment ofthe evidence for spiritualism. Most of its members, though, were anything butimpartial. Slade was able to produce some phenomena for the Commission, andconsidered the inquiry a personal success, even writing a thank-you note to theCommission, offering to return to give further demonstrations. However, theCommission’s report described Slade’s phenomena as “fraudulent throughout.” Noone had caught Slade red-handed, but various members of the Commission claimedto have seen suspicious movements of his hands or feet, and this was all theyneeded. The report, published in 1877, completely demolished Slade’s reputation.A broken man, Slade became increasingly addicted to alcohol and morphine, dyingin a Michigan sanatorium in 1905. The Seybert Commission then set out to discredit Zollner and his colleagues.The Commission’s secretary, Professor George Fullerton, traveled to Leipzig andsubsequently issued a statement declaring that Zollner had been mentallyunbalanced at the time of the Slade experiments. The other scientists weredismissed on the grounds of age or physical infirmity, portraying them as agroup of infirm old men, led by a lunatic. Zollner’s friends were infuriated atthe suggestion that he was unbalanced and offered to swear oaths that he hadbeen perfectly sane until the day of his death. But the campaign to discredit Zollner was highly successful, and today hisname is rarely mentioned in science textbooks. Nevertheless, his theories areechoed today in modern string theory, with its mathematical models ofn-dimensional space.e [08_introduction-title.html#r5]. From a booklet accompanying the Royal MailStamps issued on October 2, 2001, to commemorate the centenary of the Nobelprizes.f [08_introduction-title.html#r6]. Deutsch embodies a curious double standardabout the need for scientific evidence. He is a proponent of a theory that thereare billions of universes parallel to our own, expounded in his book The Fabricof Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes. He also speculates freely on timetravel, although there is not the slightest evidence for either of thesephenomena.g [08_introduction-title.html#r7]. However, it has been said that Humphrey“pocketed an estimated £75,000 without doing any noticeable research at all”(“Telepathy, Stamps, and Fuzzy Logic,” by Guy Lyon Playfair, in The SkepticalObserver, published online). During the three years Humphrey held the ResearchFellowship, he did no psychical research, but instead he wrote a book, SoulSearching, in which he claimed to have proved on theoretical grounds thatphenomena like telepathy were impossible. Few were impressed with his proofs.Even his fellow skeptic, Susan Blackmore, in a review of his book in NewScientist, described his dismissal of the experimental evidence for telepathy asmisleading and unfair.Chapter 1: Origins of the Debatea [10_chapter-title-1.html#rone1]. Ducasse shrewdly added that “the emotionalmotivation for irresponsible disbelief is, in fact, probably evenstronger—especially in scientifically educated persons, whose pride of knowledgeis at stake—than is in other persons the motivation for irresponsible belief.”Chapter 2: The Modern Criticsa [11_chapter-title-2.html#rtwo1]. The debate over the existence of a genuineMars Effect continues to this day, conducted mostly by psychologist SuitbertErtel and freelance technical writer Geoffrey Dean.b [11_chapter-title-2.html#rtwo2]. On the Committee’s investigation of the MarsEffect, Curry, in the article “Research on the Mars Effect,” concluded: “Theirwork could now best function as a model and a warning of how not to conduct suchinvestigations. Rawlins and Gauquelin are in fact the only two major figures toemerge with scientific credibility intact.”c [11_chapter-title-2.html#rtwo3]. Kammann describes his difficulty believingRawlins’ story when he first read it: “The trouble with ‘Starbaby’ on firstreading is that the case is too strong, and the cover-up too deep to be entirelybelievable. Like the other Fellows of CSICOP, I couldn’t accept that DennisRawlins was the single honest and correct person on a nine-man Councilconsisting of men of such stature and reputation as Martin Gardner, ProfessorRay Hyman, the Amazing Randi and Kendrick Frazier. . . . After seven months ofresearch, I have come to the opposite conclusion. CSICOP has no good defense ofthe trio’s Mars fiasco and has progressively trapped itself, degree byirreversible degree, into an anti-Rawlins propaganda campaign, into suppressionof the evidence, and into stonewalling against other critics” (The TrueDisbelievers).d [11_chapter-title-2.html#rtwo4]. In part, the statement reads: “CSICOP, as abody, does not directly engage in the testing of psychics, research onparanormal phenomena, or investigations on related matters. . . . In otherwords, CSICOP will try, within the context of its limited resources, to be acatalyst for competent research on the paranormal, but it cannot conduct theactual research itself, nor can it be held responsible for the quality andoutcome of the investigation.”e [11_chapter-title-2.html#rtwo5]. The September–October 2002 issue reportssales through vendors at 16,635 and mail subscriptions at 34,747.f [11_chapter-title-2.html#rtwo6]. In a 1989 issue of the Journal of ScientificExploration, Bauer reported an exchange of letters with Frazier in which theSkeptical Inquirer’s editor argued that “the magazine’s purpose is not toconsider what the best evidence for anomalous claims might be but to argueagainst them” (Bauer’s words).g [11_chapter-title-2.html#rtwo7]. Contrast this with what she wrote about theliterature on psi research: “I began discovering mountains of research and avast relevant literature I hadn’t known existed. As astonished as I was by thesheer quantity, I was equally astonished by the high caliber. Much of theresearch not only met but far exceeded ordinary standards of rigorous mainstreamscience” (Mayer, Extraordinary Knowing, 69).h [11_chapter-title-2.html#rtwo8]. Kurtz is widely regarded as the driving forcebehind CSI/CSICOP. Although he once taught philosophy, Kurtz has been moreaccurately described as a “businesspersonmissionary.” He is the founder ofPrometheus Books, the primary purveyor of antiparanormal books in the UnitedStates. But some of Kurtz’s reviewers are not very impressed with the quality ofhis own writing. Stokes (“Promethean Fire”) has pointed out several examples ofdogmatism and sheer misrepresentation in his review of The TranscendentalTemptation. And Hansen wrote in 1992: “Although Kurtz has shown exceptionaldynamism and success as a businessperson and as a missionary for secularhumanism, his position as a philosopher seems a bit less impressive. HisExuberance: An Affirmative Philosophy of Life is something of a ‘positivethinking’ book for humanists, and a recent review compared the level of hiswriting with that of Shirley MacLaine” (Hansen, “CSCICOP and the Skeptics,” 37).i [11_chapter-title-2.html#rtwo9]. There is an apocalyptic strain to some of theCommittee’s writing. For instance, the announcement of the founding of CSICOPstated: “Perhaps we ought not to assume that the scientific enlightenment willcontinue indefinitely . . . like the Hellenic civilization, it may beoverwhelmed by irrationalism, subjectivism, and obscurantism” (Kurtz, “Committeeto Scientifically Investigate Claims of Paranormal and Other Phenomena”).Chapter 4: The Early Yearsa [14_chapter-title-4.html#rfour1]. This remark was made to William Barrett,professor of physics in the Royal College of Science in Dublin, and one of theearly founders of the Society for Psychical Research.b [14_chapter-title-4.html#rfour2]. Note that which error we try to avoiddepends upon the perceived cost of making that error. The world of scientificresearch tends to be very conservative in its approach to accepting new ideas,so there is tacit agreement that the cost of a Type I error is higher than thatof a Type II error (that is, it is preferable to mistakenly conclude that thereis no effect when there really is one than it is to mistakenly conclude there isan effect when there really is none). Thus, this emphasis on avoiding Type Ierrors tends to put the burden of evidence on researchers who are making newclaims. However, in other situations, such as certain medical investigations,the cost of a Type II error is considered much higher than the cost of a Type Ierror. In such cases, tentative conclusions may be reached and acted upon beforesamples of data are available that would be large enough to reject the nullhypothesis at the 5 percent significance level with the effect size observed inthe sample at hand.c [14_chapter-title-4.html#rfour3]. The “true” result can be viewed in twodifferent ways: in the case of a finite population, it can be thought of as theresult of an experiment or survey conducted on the entire population—forinstance, a political poll that surveyed the entire country’s voting-agepopulation. In the case of experiments that can be conducted over and over, thetrue result may be thought of as the result we would attain as the number ofexperiments approached infinity.Chapter 8: The Research of the Skepticsa [18_chapter-title-8.html#reight1]. In her autobiography, in a chapter titled“I Don’t Know,” she is even more emphatic, writing, “I don’t know, I don’t know,I don’t know!”b [18_chapter-title-8.html#reight2]. This is the text from Wiseman’s website(www.richardwiseman.com/research/psychics.html[http://www.richardwiseman.com/research/psychics.html]): “Dr Matthew Smith(Liverpool Hope University) and Prof Wiseman conducted four experimentsexamining the claim that a Yorkshire terrier named Jaytee could psychicallydetect when his owner was returning home. The results of these experiments didnot support the existence of any paranormal communication between the owner andher pet. This research was widely reported in the media and published in TheBritish Journal of Psychology.”c [18_chapter-title-8.html#reight3]. The full quote is: “I’ve found plenty ofevidence of unscientific approaches to data, but have never come across aparanormal experiment that can be replicated.”Chapter 9: The Roots of Disbeliefa [20_chapter-title-9.html#rnine1] At the time Hyman wrote this article (1996)the “handful of experiments” included 61 independent ganzfeld experiments, 2,094PK experiments using random event generators, and hundreds of other experimentsinvolving tossing dice, dream research, and remote viewing. 131b [20_chapter-title-9.html#rnine2] In the study by Evans (1973), 53 percent ofthe “ESP is an impossibility” responses came from psychologists, althoughpsychologists made up only 6 percent of the total sample. Only 3 percent ofnatural scientists considered ESP “an impossibility,” compared to 34 percent ofpsychologists.Chapter 10: Modern Science versus Classical Sciencea [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten1]. Excellent discussions of these issues can befound in Lee Smolin’s book, Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, and in chapter 5 ofHyperspace by Michio Kaku. Quantum mechanics describes three of the fourfundamental forces of modern physics: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force(which holds atomic nuclei together), and the weak nuclear force (which governsradioactive decay). Relativity describes the fourth—gravity. A unified theorywould describe all four forces.b [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten2]. Those encountering quantum theory here forthe first time may wish to bear in mind the words of physicist Niels Bohr: If aperson does not feel shocked when he first encounters quantum theory, he has notunderstood a word of it.c [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten3]. A very clear description of this experimentcan be found in Bartley, “The Philosphy of Karl Popper Part II,” pages 679–83.Note that in 1978, when this article was published, it was still only a thoughtexperiment, but it has since been performed.d [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten4]. Because this wave carries no energy andreveals itself only indirectly through its statistical influence on a largenumber of particle events, Einstein called it a Gespensterfeld, or ghost field.Since the wave carries not energy but probability—such as the probability thatan electron will be found at a certain point—the French physicists have giventhe wave function the poetic name densité de presence, density of presence.e [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten5]. Technically, the probability distribution isthe absolute square of the wave function.f [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten6]. Some defenders of the Copenhageninterpretation will assert that the use of a measuring instrument to make arecord results in a thermodynamically irreversible event, and so anything thatmakes a record can collapse the state vector. The problem with this is, as E. H.Walker writes, that “thermodynamic irreversibility is derived from the basicprinciples of physics and requires for that derivation the assumption of statevector collapse” (“Measurement in Quantum Mechanics Revisited,” 345). In otherwords, a thermodynamically irreversible event requires the state vector to firstcollapse and so cannot be used to explain it.g [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten7]. Note that the transistor is a purely quantummechanical device.h [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten8]. Physicist Henry Stapp writes: “Whereas theCopenhagen approach excluded the bodies and brains of the human observers fromthe physical world that they sought to describe, and renounced the aim ofdescribing reality itself, von Neumann demanded logical cohesion andmathematical precision, and was willing to follow where this rational approachled. Being a mathematician, fortified by the rigor and precision of his thought,he seemed less intimidated than his physicist brethren by the sharp contrastbetween the nature of the world called for by the new mathematics and the natureof the world that the genius of Isaac Newton had concocted” (Mindful Universe,142).i [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten9]. It should be pointed out that the averagequantum mechanic is about as interested in philosophy as the average garagemechanic. Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku wrote: “When confronted with stickyphilosophical questions, such as the role of ‘consciousness’ in performingquantum measurement, most physicists shrug their shoulders. As long as they cancalculate the outcome of an experiment, they really don’t care about itsphilosophical implications. . . . Nevertheless, although the average physicistis not bothered by philosophical questions, the greatest of them were. Einstein,Heisenberg, and Bohr spent long hours in heated discussions, wrestling late intothe night with the meaning of measurement, the problems of consciousness, andthe meaning of probability in their work” (Hyperspace, 317).j [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten10]. For excellent discussions of these mattersaimed at the layperson, I refer the reader to Squires, The Mystery of theQuantum World; Polkinghorne, The Quantum World; and Herbert, Quantum Reality.k [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten11]. It should be mentioned that Squires did notseem, at least at the time of this writing— 1994—to be convinced of the realityof extrasensory perception, as he added, “Such evidence, however, is perhapsbetter left out of the discussion until it becomes more convincing.”l [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten12]. The story of how nonlocality was proven istold in an entertaining manner in the book Entanglement by Amir Aczel.m [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten13]. According to quantum mechanics, gravity ismediated by hypothetical particles called gravitons. Accordng to generalrelativity, gravity does not operate with an exchange of particles, but israther a distortion in space caused by the mass of objects. Yet its influence isstill subject to the cosmic speed limit set by light.n [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten14]. Physicist John Bell derived a simpleinequality known today as Bell’s Inequality, which must hold if reality isindeed local. A clear description of Bell’s Inequality and the experiments thatdemonstrate violations of it can be found in chapter 12 of Quantum Reality byNick Herbert.o [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten15]. For a somewhat detailed discussion andadditional references, see Herbert, Elemental Mind, especially chapter 10. Thesemodels of quantum consciousness are essentially dualistic; they propose thatconsciousness collapses potentialities into actualities in the brain, and Walkerattempts to account for psi in a similar manner (see Walker, “Consciousness andQuantum Theory”). Speculations on the connection between quantum mechanics andconsciousness can also be found in Rosenblum and Kuttner, “Consciousness andQuantum Mechanics.”p [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten16]. Many physicists believe that nonlocalitycannot be used to send messages. However, this assumes that the collapse of thewave function is completely random and ignores the evidence from micro-PKexperiments that indicate human intent may bias the collapse of the wavefunction in a desired direction. This is discussed in more detail in chapter 16.q [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten17]. Geneticist Michael Denton devotes chapter 2of his book Nature’s Destiny to a discussion of the many remarkable physical andchemical emergent properties of water. He writes, “Certainly the phenomenon ofemergence is encountered throughout the natural world. We cannot predict theproperties of water from quantum mechanices” (Denton, Nature’s Destiny, 365).r [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten18]. It could be argued that all of life is theend result of downward causation, as all the elements except hydrogen wereoriginally forged in the interiors of stars. Popper describes stars as aprebiological example of downward causation. Stars may be viewed as machinesthat put the atoms and elementary particles in their central region underterrific gravitational pressure, with the “result that some atomic nuclei fuseand form the nuclei of heavier elements; an excellent example of downwardcausation, of the action of the whole structure upon its constituent parts”(Popper and Eccles, The Self and Its Brain, 20).s [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten19]. Note the self-refuting nature of the firstposition: If I believe that consciousness does not exist, then how could mybelief exist? If it does not, then neither does my belief. And if my expressionof belief is just a machine going through the motions, then you have no reasonto accept it as correct. As for the identity theory: If brain states can bedescribed in physical terms (at least in principle), and if thoughts areidentical to brain states, then why can’t we describe thoughts in physicalterms? Unlike brain states, thoughts have no position, mass, charge, and soforth.t [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten20]. Examples are renowned philosopher CurtDucasse, neurophysiologist and Nobel laureate Sir John Eccles, and thecelebrated neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield. It should be pointed out that none ofthese individuals hold this position as a matter of religious faith.u [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten21]. The history and current status ofartificial intelligence (AI) research is discussed in a very entertaining mannerin chapter 7 of John Horgan’s book The Undiscovered Mind.v [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten22]. Eccles provides a clear exposition ofLibet’s experiments (compete with diagrams) in The Self and Its Brain, by Popperand Eccles, 256–59.w [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten23]. Some of my critics are bound to point outthat Roger Sperry did not share this view. For instance, shortly before hisdeath he wrote that his account of consciousness leaves for dualism “onlyabstract arguments like those from Plato and Popper, and observations like thosefrom parapsychology” (Sperry, Science and Moral Priority, 93).x [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten24]. Beloff writes: “Most of our transactionswith the world are effectuated through the brain. Paranormal action andparanormal cognition occur when, for some obscure reason, we are able to by-passthe dependence on the brain and allow the mind to interact directly with theoutside world” (Beloff, “Mind-Body Interaction in Light of the ParapsychologicalEvidence”).y [21_chapter-title-10.html#rten25]. Geneticist Micheal Denton wonders, “Whatselection pressures on the ancient plains of Africa gifted mankind with musicalability, artistic competence, the capacity for profound abstraction, andultimately the ability to comprehend the entire cosmos from which we sprang?”(Denton, Nature’s Destiny, 362).Chapter 12: Psi and Physicsa [23_chapter-title-12.html#rtwelve1] Dennett completely ignores quantumphysics, and writes: “This fundamentally antiscientific stance of dualism is, tomy mind, its most disqualifying feature, and is the reason why in this book Iadopt the apparently dogmatic rule that dualism is to be avoided at all costs”(Consciousness Explained, 37). For effective refutations of the views of Dennettand several other philosophers by quantum physicists, see Wigner, “Remarks onthe Mind-Body Problem”; Firsoff, “Life and Quantum Physics”; Rosenblum andKuttner, “Consciousness and Quantum Mechanics”; and Stapp, “Attention,Intention, and Will in Quantum Physics.”b [23_chapter-title-12.html#rtwelve2] Despite giving his book the rather pompoustitle Consciousness Explained, Dennett of course does no such thing: he ends upsimply denying the existence of conscious experience (presumably because of hisfailure to explain it). Tracing the absurdity of the views of philosophers suchas Dennett on the mind-body problem to an adherence to outmoded physics,physicist Henry Stapp writes: “There is a growing group of physicists whobelieve almost all thinking on this issue during the past few centuries to belogically unsound, because it is based implicitly on the precepts of classicaltheory, which are now known to be fundamentally incorrect. Contemporary physicaltheory differs profoundly from classical physical theory precisely on the natureof the dynamical linkage between minds and physical states” (“Attention,Intention, and Will in Quantum Physics,” 145).c [23_chapter-title-12.html#rtwelve3] Keeton wrote, “It is still within theprovince of reason to question this great dogma notwithstanding the fact that itis a god at whose feet many scientists worship with blind and jealous devotion.”His main point in the article is that the theory of the conservation of energyis not falsifiable by any possible set of observations, and that it can beinterpreted to cover any observed energy relationships.Chapter 13: Toward a New Worldviewa [24_chapter-title-13.html#rthir1] McClenon rightly considers a mechanicalmodel of nature to be scientistic rather than scientific, and he notes howmodern physics has outgrown a mechanistic conception of nature. The point is ofcourse that psi is not accepted by some because it resists a mechanisticexplanation.b [24_chapter-title-13.html#rthir2] One of the two original founders of quantummechanics (along with Einstein) was the great physicist Max Planck, who sadlyremarked in his autobiography, “a new scientific truth does not triumph byconvincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because itsopponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar withit” (Planck, Scientific Autobiography).Chapter 14: The Impoverished State of Skepticisma [26_chapter-title-14.html#rfor1] “Replication on demand” is a problem notexclusive to psi research but found throughout the life sciences. Commenting onexperiments in conventional psychology, Seymour Epstein wrote in a prominentpsychology journal: “Not only are experimental findings often difficult toreplicate when there are the slightest alterations in conditions, but evenattempts at exact replication frequently fail” (“The Stability of Behavior,”790). Sociologist Harry Collins conducted an extensive study of replication inscience and concluded: “Experiments hardly ever work the first time; indeed,they hardly ever work at all” (Changing Order, 40).Chapter 15: The Nature of Sciencea [27_chapter-title-15.html#rfive1] All his life Newton was somewhat embarrassedby his own theory of gravity, thinking it incomplete and in need of some furtherexplanation. “That gravity,” he wrote, “should be innate, inherent, andessential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance . . .is to me so great an absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophicalmatters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it” (Popper,Conjectures and Refutations, 106). He tried hard to explain it further butfailed, refusing to invent any ad hoc hypothesis (hypotheses non fingo).b [27_chapter-title-15.html#rfive2] What makes Gauquelin’s neoastrologicalclaims so different from traditional astrology, of course, is that they areformulated in such a manner as to be easily tested—that is, they are capable ofbeing falsified by the data.c [27_chapter-title-15.html#rfive3] Critics of Popper’s theories occasionallyquestion whether or not the theory of falsifiability is itself falsifiable. Butthis question should not be asked, as the theory is not meant to be a scientifictheory: that is, it does not consist of a proposed universal relationshipbetween two or more empirical phenomena. It is meant to be a methodological orphilosophical theory, one that offers a method by which science may learn andadvance: boldly propose new theories and then attempt to prove them false. It isimportant to remember that falsification is a criterion of demarcation, not ofmeaning.d [27_chapter-title-15.html#rfive4] Shermer’s book is an attempt to classifyvarious lines of research into science, nonscience, and “borderlands” science,but he follows no rigorous methodology, such as Popper’s. Instead, hesubjectively classifies various theories, practices, and lines of research intohis three categories.e [27_chapter-title-15.html#rfive5] For instance, it does not follow from thisthat such life would want to contact us, would share our values, would befriendly toward us, and so forth.Chapter 16: The Scientific Status of Parapsychologya [28_chapter-title-16.html#rsix1] Apollo 14 astronaut Ed Mitchell took part ina telepathy experiment with colleagues on Earth while in orbit in 1971. Theresults showed evidence of telepathy, but the number of trials was too small tobe statistically significant.b [28_chapter-title-16.html#rsix2] The original papers of von Neumann, Wigner,London, and Bauer on the consciousness question have been collected by Wheelerand Zurek in Quantum Theory and Measurement.c [28_chapter-title-16.html#rsix3] Quantum theories of mind/brain interaction donot necessarily imply that the mind can exist without a brain to express itselfwith. This is a separate issue.d [28_chapter-title-16.html#rsix4] Those assumptions concern the strength ofelectrical barriers in the synapses. See Herbert, Elemental Mind, 260–61.e [28_chapter-title-16.html#rsix5] Walker considers two possibilities: in thefirst, consciousness is localized in the brain and produces nonlocal effects vianonlocal correlations between brain states and physical states outside of thebrain. In the second, consciousness itself is nonlocal: that is, it extendsbeyond the spatial limits of the brain: “Instead of just observing its own braindirectly, consciousness is also able to directly observe physical objectsdistant from the brain. . . . We do not wish to imply that consciousness alwaysbehaves nonlocally, but rather that it is capable of nonlocal behavior” (Mattuckand Walker, “The Action of Consciousness on Matter,” 127).f [28_chapter-title-16.html#rsix6] The details of these theories are beyond thescope of this book. Interested readers may consult the original sources in thereferences. The mathematician Douglas Stokes has provided an excellent summaryand comparison of the various quantum theories of psi (see Stokes, “TheoreticalParapsychology”).g [28_chapter-title-16.html#rsix7] Biologist Rupert Sheldrake has taken sometentative steps in this direction with his novel theory of the “extended mind.”His arguments may be found in his book The Sense of Being Stared At.h [28_chapter-title-16.html#rsix8] Popper writes: “Explanation is alwaysincomplete: we can always raise another why-question. And the new why-questionmay lead to a new theory which not only ‘explains’ the old theory, but correctsit. This is why the evolution of physics is likely to be an endless process ofcorrection and better approximation (303)” (“Autobiography,” 103).i [28_chapter-title-16.html#rsix9]One is reminded of a remark the biologistErnst Haeckel is alleged to have made: If the facts do not agree with my theory,so much worse for the facts!j [28_chapter-title-16.html#rsix10] Note that many psychological phenomena arestudied without benefit of a full theoretical explanation, such as learning,memory, and hypnosis.Chapter 17: Hume’s Argument Revisiteda [29_chapter-title-17.html#rseven1] For an excellent summary of the rise ofscience during the seventeenth century, see Russell, A History of WesternPhilosophy, chapter VI.b [29_chapter-title-17.html#rseven2] The distinction is actually between themechanistic and the nonmechanistic and is based on the assumption that thenatural world operates on entirely mechanistic principles. This philosophicaldoctrine was derived from classical physics, in which all influences are localand physical. Modern physics is no longer limited to mechanistic influence: twoexamples of nonmechanistic influence are nonlocality and the collapse of thewavefunction by conscious observation. Because nonmechanistic influences are nowpart of modern science, the terms “supernatural” and “paranormal” areanachronisms.c [29_chapter-title-17.html#rseven3] To be fair, Hume does admit thisdifficulty, but he seems to imply that he has no choice if he is going to writeanything more. “The sceptic still continues to reason and believe, even thoughhe asserts that he cannot defend his reason by reason” (Treatise of HumanNature, Book I, part iv, section ii).d [29_chapter-title-17.html#rseven4] Scientists today speak less often of “laws”and more frequently of “models,” in which anything resembling laws are presentedas tentative propositions within the model.Chapter 18: Paradigms and Parapsychologya [30_chapter-title-18.html#reit1] A fascinating critical overview of mindscience can be found in The Undiscovered Mind by science writer John Horgan.b [30_chapter-title-18.html#reit2] In his autobiography, Popper writes about hisown early struggles to overcome dogmatic thinking. One of the most importantincidents in his life occurred on the day in his youth when he realized withhorror that he had embraced Marxism without critical thought: “I had accepted adangerous creed uncritically, dogmatically” (“Autobiography,” 26)."},{"pageContent":"NotesFOREWORD1.
