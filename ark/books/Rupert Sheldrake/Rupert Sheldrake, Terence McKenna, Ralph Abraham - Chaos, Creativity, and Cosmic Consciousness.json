Bergen’s chief dummy, Charlie McCarthy,was one of the best-loved characters in radio comedy and was featured in manymovies as well. He was also my very dear friend, and when he was sitting onBergen’s knee, we would have many sprightly and madcap conversations.When Dad and I entered the open door of Bergen’s hotel room, we found himsitting on a bed with his back to us, talking very intently to Charlie and thenlistening with evident wonder and astonishment to Charlie’s answers. Unlike inthe radio programs, there was no flippancy here, no “in-on joke” sarcasm.Indeed, one got the impression that Bergen was the student, while Charlie wasquite clearly the teacher.“What are they doing?” I silently mouthed at my, father. “Just rehearsing,” hemouthed back. But as we listened to what Bergen and Charlie were saying, we soonrealized that this was no rehearsal for any radio program we ever knew about,for Bergen was asking his dummy ultimate questions like “What is the meaning oflife? What is the nature of love? Is there any truth to be found?” And Charliewas answering with the wisdom of millennia. It was as if all the great thinkersof all times and places were compressed inside his little wooden head and werepouring out their distilled knowings through his little clacking jaws.Bergen would get so excited by these remarkable answers that he would ask stillmore ultimate questions: “But, Charlie, can the mind be separate from the brain?Who created the universe, and how? Can we really ever know anything?” Charliewould continue to answer in his luminous way, pouring out pungent, beautifullycrafted statements of deep wisdom. This rascally faced little dummy dressed in atuxedo was expounding the kind of knowing that could have come only from alifetime of intensive study, observation, and interaction with equally highbeings. After several minutes of listening spellbound to this wooden Socrates,my father remembered his theological position as an agnostic Baptist andcoughed. Bergen looked up, turned beet red, and stammered a greeting. “Hello,Jack. Hi, Jean. I see you caught us.”“Yeah, Ed,” my father said. “What in the world were you rehearsing? I suredidn’t write that stuff.”“No rehearsal, Jack. I was talking to Charlie. He’s the wisest person I know.”“But, Ed,” my father expostulated, “that’s your voice and your mind coming outof that cockeyed block of wood.”“Yes, Jack, I suppose it is,” Bergen answered quietly. But then he added withgreat poignancy, “And yet when he answers me, I have no idea where it’s comingfrom or what he’s going to say next. It is so much more than I know.”Those words of Bergen changed my life. For I suddenly knew that we contain “somuch more” than we think we do. In fact, it would seem that in our ordinarywaking reality we live on the shelf in the attic of our selves, leaving theother floors relatively uninhabited and the basement locked (except when itoccasionally explodes). I also knew that I had no other choice but to pursue apath and a career that would discover ways to tap into the “so much more” ofdeep knowledge that we all carry in the many levels of reality and nested gnosiswithin ourselves.In reading Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness I found myself once againeavesdropping on an extended conversation of ultimate questions and far-reachinganswers. This time, however, the principals are no dummies, unless one thinks ofthe very cosmos as their ventriloquist. Ralph Abraham, Terence McKenna, andRupert Sheldrake are among the brightest and most thoughtful men alive on theplanet today. Still, the mystery of intelligence ignited and the calling forthof incendiary visions remains. These thinkers quicken in each other aremembrance of things future as well as things past. They evoke from one anothera new treasure trove of ideas that could keep us all thinking for the nexthundred years—so much so that I find myself wondering, To whom and to what am Ilistening? What is this book? A concerto of cosmologists? An atelier ofthoughtdancers? A marching society of the ancient Gnostic order of metaphysicalinebriates? Or have the spirits of Thomas Aquinas, Peter Abelard, and SaintBonaventure come back to run rampant through the polymorphous parade ofintellectual possibilities felt and known by each of these fellows?These trialogues are surely a minefield of mind probes, a singular sapientcircle of gentlemen geniuses at their edgiest of edges. Their metaphors alonewould leave a Muse in a muddle.Meeting yearly and, more recently, publicly with each other at Esalen, theyraise through their conversations the rheostat of consciousness of themselvesand their listeners. They cut loose from whatever remains of orthodoxconsiderations and become minds at the end of their tethers, who then re-tethereach other to go farther out in their speculations. In so doing, they havefigured out how to achieve one of the best of all possible worlds: the sharingof mental space and cosmic terrains over many years of deep friendship andprofound dialogue.The questions they pose each other are of the sort that the Hound of Heavenbrings barking to our heels. Here is a sampling: Are the eternal laws of naturestill evolving? Is there a realm beyond space and time that grants the patternsand the conditions for creativity, organization, and emergent evolutionaryprocess, or does the universe make itself up as it goes along? Are the causes ofthings in the past or are they in the future? Is there some hyperdimensional,transcendental Object luring us forward? Is history but the shadow cast backwardby eschatology? Are we humans the imaginers or the imagined; or is history insome way a co-creation—an unsettled, chronically evolving, funky partnershipbetween ourselves and the hyperdimensional Pattern Maker? Are the visionaryvegetables our potentiators and our guides; and is theobotany the key to it all?Is chaos merely chaotic, or does it harbor the dynamics of all creativity? Whatis the connection between physical light and the light of consciousness? How dowe breach our fundamental boundaries so as to enter a new phase of the humanadventure?Let the reader be warned that this is a curiously initiatory kind of book, onethat serves to recreate the landscapes and inscapes of our culture, our science,and ourselves. The participants in these trialogues have in their own waysstriven to green the current wasteland by the remarkable range of their humanexperience as well as by their depth of thought. This they have done bypersonally engaging in more levels of reality, investigating the range anddepths of the ecology of inner and outer space, and bringing back richtravelers’ tales of their discoveries.This series of trialogues is a living testament to the fact that we are livingin times during which our very nature is in transition. The scope of change iscalling forth patterns and potentials in the human brain/mind system that as faras we know were never needed before. Things that were relegated to theunconscious are moving into consciousness. Things that belonged in the realm ofextraordinary experiences as well as ideas of the nature and practice of realityare becoming ordinary. And many of the maps of the psyche and its unfolding areundergoing awesome change. This is not to say that there are not perennialthings about the deep psyche that will always remain generally true. But ourways and means of reaching them are through routings never known before. Theprincipals in Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness are leading the waysin exploring the new routings. They show us how discontinuities and multipleassociations of the old tribal societies have again become important. Chaostheory becomes critical in understanding the way things work. We must look forflow patterns rather than linear cause-effect explanations. Resonance—bothmorphic and interpersonal—has become far more important than relevance. Theworld is now a field of colossal busybodyness with quanta of energies affectingeverything simultaneously. And with this resonance, nothing is truly hiddenanymore. This is why this is also a book of secrets revealed—on every page; no,more, in every paragraph. Caveat emptor.The rapidity with which ideas are here offered, plumbed, and thenpotentiated—the speed and passion with which myths and symbols are presented andthen rewoven into new tapestries of the spirit—serves as witness to theacceleration of the psyche in our times. The human psyche is one of the greatforces of reality as a whole. It is a thing that bridges what may appear to beseparate realities—that is, it is a great force of nature, it is a great forceof spirit, and it is greatest of all as the tension that unites the two. Nowthis psyche may be moving toward phase-lock breakout—that is, the jump time ofthe psyche—manifesting as many different singularities of itself as it movestoward convergence and transition. This means it is moving at stupendous speedpast the limits most people have lived with for thousands of years into anutterly different state of mind. The contents of the psyche are manifesting atfaster and faster rates—a dreamlike reality in which it is difficult to tellanymore what is news and what is drama—or, for that matter, what is myth andwhat is matter.We live in a surround of electronic stimulation that extends to all tribes,nations, peoples, realities, and the Earth herself through every one of us. Weleave out nobody. Everybody has to participate eventually, however impoverishedand unseen they may be at the moment. We have been returned electronically andin fractal waves of multicultural convergence to a tribal world of instantaneousinformation and dialogue.Chaos, Creativity, and Cosmic Consciousness is this worldwide phenomenon writsmall. Within it, as in the world we now live in, realities come as thick andfast as frequencies. We are constantly sitting at the shore absorbing thefrequency waves of these realities, peoples, experiences, and energies all thetime. This absorption, I maintain, is changing all the patterns of the ways inwhich we are composed and, by extension, the ways in which we now have toorchestrate and conduct this new composition. We live in chaos, which we mayhave created in order to hasten our own meeting with ourselves—that is, to blowdown the old structures that no longer sustain us. In our lifetimes, the greatsustaining cultures have moved from agriculture to factory culture to technoculture to omniculture. And people like Abraham, Sheldrake, and McKenna areemergent apologists for this omniculture. This they can be because of theirappreciation of myth.All over the world myths have risen to conscious popularity because we can nolonger understand the dreamscapes of our everyday waking life. The myth issomething that never was but is always happening. It serves as a kind of DNA ofthe human psyche, carrying within it the coded genetics for any number ofpossible evolutionary and cultural paths we might yet follow. This is quitepossibly why these fellows couch their language in mythic cadence. They knowthey are on to Some Thing and perhaps, even, to Some One, so their mouths aremetaphored and become full of the blood. The authors are on the verge of tellingthe new and larger Story. You see and read at another level. These trialoguesbecome a text of “Ceremonies at the Edge of History,” an Eleusinian mystery playin which we are invited to join the three celebrants to sing as Pindar did whenhe reflected on the ancient mysteries: “Blessed are they who have seen thesethings. They know the end of life, and they know the God-given beginnings.”—Jean HoustonPomona, New YorkMarch 1992Jean Houston, Ph.D., is the author of a dozen books including The Hero and theGoddess, The Search for the Beloved, and The Possible Human.

One day, as I was standing on a streetcorner in front of the Santa Cruz post office in white robes waiting for a ride,a car stopped and Doug Hanson, a friend whom I had not seen in a year, said,“Get in, I have someone for you to meet.” Having no other agenda, I got in. Heleft me in front of a frame house on Carlton Street in downtown Berkeley. I wentup one flight of stairs to a little attic, where Terence McKenna was stoopedover a terrarium, studying a dead butterfly and living mushrooms. We startedtalking, roving over a vast landscape everywhere familiar to us both, and hourspassed.Over the course of the seventies we evolved a pattern of relating, including aminimum of chitchat, dinners, and hours of dialogue followed by sleep. Our talkson philosophy, mathematics, and science created a space between us for mutualexploration and discovery, which diffused into my professional work. A papercalled “Vibrations and the Realization of Form,” published in 1975 by ErichJantsch, came out of this space.In September 1982, a routine visit to Terence was interrupted by a phone callannouncing the arrival of Rupert Sheldrake at the bus station. I had recentlyread his book A New Science of Life, which had caused a stir in England, andfound it extraordinarily compatible with my own thought. When we picked upRupert, he entered effortlessly into the mental space Terence and I had createdover a decade, as his presence stretched the space into an equilateral triangle.Through the eighties we explored and extended our trialogue, making manythrilling discoveries as a bonded triad, self-conscious of our trinity, synergy,and partnership. Occasionally, at various conference and performance platforms,our activity emerged into public view. Eventually, with the encouragement ofNancy Kaye Lunney of Esalen Institute, the idea of turning the trialogue into apublic workshop emerged.image [images/fxvii-01.jpg]My life has largely been ruled by the search for a certain iridescence, acertain glint or scintilla of noetic light that finds its way into a painting, aplace, a book, or, in some few extraordinary cases, a person. Twenty years havepassed since Ralph Abraham was brought to meet me by a friend from my highschool days, who assured me that an extraordinary mingling of the minds wouldoccur. This, in fact, has proven to be the case. Our separate journeys havetaken us to many of the same places—to the Himalayas as well as the frontiers ofmathematics and hands-on pharmacology.Regarding Rupert Sheldrake, my travels and adventures in the Amazon had made meever keen to explore the issues of theoretical biology. So naturally I jumped atthe chance to meet him at a moment when awareness of the controversy surroundinghis first book, A New Science of Life, was just breaking over the Americannew-science crowd.For many years I’ve held wise and private consul with these two friends: Ralph,with steadfastness, humor, and insight; and Rupert, with qualities of kindnessand gentleness that are rare in a scientific revolutionary. Only just before theconception of this book was it pointed out to me that a wider sharing of thesediscussions, dealing as they do with some of the great unfolding issues of allour lives, might offer valuable insight to others. Deep these trialogues may be,but the spirit in which they have been offered is one of three grown men deeplyengaged in play. Our offer to the reader has been simply this: You can comealong, too.image [images/fxviii-01.jpg]In 1981, a year before meeting Ralph and Terence, my first book, A New Scienceof Life, was published in Britain. This was my attempt, as a biologist, to setout the hypothesis of morphic resonance, according to which there is an inherentmemory in nature. The book had stirred up a great deal of controversy in Europe,especially when the international scientific journal Nature condemned it in aneditorial entitled “A Book for Burning?” Having spent ten years doing researchin one of the citadels of scientific orthodoxy, the biochemistry department atthe University of Cambridge, I was well aware that the idea of collectivememory, transmitted by a new kind of non-material resonance, was not likely towin immediate acceptance. Having spent some six years in India, where I workedin an international agricultural research institute, l was also well aware thatthe mechanistic worldview of scientific orthodoxy was only one way of looking atthe world.The book was published in the United States by Jeremy Tarcher in Los Angeles,and this brought me to California in 1982, my first journey to that frontier ofthe West; I had just turned forty. Early one morning Dan Drasin, a friend in SanFrancisco, put me on a bus to Santa Rosa, telling me he’d arranged a meetingthere he felt sure I’d appreciate. I was to be met by someone called TerenceMcKenna. Sure enough, a puckish figure in dark glasses appeared at the bus stopin an aging Cadillac and took me off to his family home in the depths of SonomaCounty. There I met his friend Ralph Abraham.In England, especially at Cambridge, I enjoyed the discipline of mind imposed bythe critical method, the historical awareness, the quickness of response, theactive intelligence. In excess, however, it was oppressive. New ideas weretreated as guilty until proven innocent, and as soon as I or anyone took off ona flight of speculation, the others opened fire. Shooting people down is afavorite sport of academics, and Cambridge is a free-fire zone.In California, I found a sense of freedom from the past and an invigoratingenthusiasm for the new, but much of it was shallow rooted and there was littleplace for wit, until I met Ralph and Terence. We had all been to India and hadbeen much influenced by the unimaginable variety and complexity of culturalforms, the human warmth, and the speculative anarchy. We shared an interest inscience and in the realms of consciousness beyond.In the years since 1982 we’ve spent much time together trying out new ideas,developing old ones, and enjoying each others’ company. Our conversations have arange and freedom I have rarely encountered elsewhere, and they have been for methe source of many new insights, as well as of inspiration and renewal. l hopethat this book will encourage others to explore with their friends some of thequestions we discuss here and will serve as a reminder of the importance ofdialogue as a means of discovery.image [images/f0xix-01.jpg]This book grew out of a series of discussions that had gone on for more thaneight years. In our first discussion in 1982, we were delighted to find that ourdifferent areas of interest and styles of thinking were synergistic. Since thattime, we have been able to explore our current interests together in ways thathave been exciting and stimulating for ourselves and for others. Our friendshiphas been a source of inspiration in our individual research and writing.From September 8 to 12, 1989, we met at Esalen Institute, in Big Sur,California, for four days of talk. The first two days consisted of a publicprogram of dialogues and trialogues; during the second two days, we metprivately. We met there again from September 3 to 6, 1990. The editedtranscripts of our discussions at Esalen form the basis of this book.These trialogues took place at the geographical edge of the West and in ametaphorical sense, they represent the thinking that is now possible at theleading edge of our culture. Each of us is a pioneer in new areas of thought:Ralph Abraham in the new theory of chaos; Terence McKenna in the revaluation ofpsychedelic experience and shamanic traditions; and Rupert Sheldrake in the newunderstanding of nature in terms of the evolution of habits. Where are thesedevelopments leading? What relationship do they have to each other, to religionand visionary experience, to our understanding of cosmic evolution, to theresacralization of the Earth, to the current ecological and political crisis,and to the coming of a new millennium? These are some of the questions wediscuss in these trialogues.In this book, we also explore the nature of the dialogue and trialoguethemselves. Ever since Plato, dialogues have been recognized as a uniquelyeffective way of exploring the realm of thought: they are the basis of thedialectical method. But insofar as the dialectic of two points of view canresult in a synthesis, it presupposes a third point of view that includes thetwo starting positions. We have found that trialogues have a more harmoniousdynamic than dialogues with only two people, partly because the synthesisimplicit in a fruitful dialogue can be made explicit by the third person. Thereis a current revival of interest in the dialogue form (perhaps the best-knownexample being the series of discussions between Joseph Campbell and BillMoyers), and we hope that our book will help further the appreciation of thedynamics of dialogues and trialogues.This book begins with a series of three dialogues in which each of us talks toeach of the others and the third person comments toward the end of thediscussion. In these dialogues, and in the trialogue that follows them, we areinvestigating the relationships among creativity, chaos, and imagination, andthe relationship of these three concepts to the soul of the world. Rupert takesthe point of view of evolutionary creativity, Ralph of chaos, and Terence ofimagination. These discussions are followed by six further trialogues, led byeach of us in turn.We know of no comparable book. We hope that the excitement we have experiencedexploring ideas together will communicate itself to readers. We believe that ourexperience of talking together and our personal affinity have enabled us torange widely and have given a cohesion to our discussions. This book shouldappeal to anyone interested in contemporary developments in scientific thought,the emergence of green consciousness, visionary experience, a new relationshipto nature, the revival of religion, and the future of the West. We hope thatthis book will stimulate readers to continue these discussions in their ownminds and together with their friends."},{"pageContent":"image [images/f0020-01.jpg]What I suggest is the existence of a kind of memory inherent in each organism inwhat I call its morphogenetic or morphic field.

Two of the West’s fundamental models ofreality are in tremendous conflict. The existing worldview of science is anunstable combination of two great tectonic plates of theory that are crashinginto each other. Where they meet, there are major theoretical earthquakes anddisruptions and volcanos of speculation.One of these theories says that there’s an unchanging permanence underlyingeverything that we know, see, experience, and feel. In Newtonian physics, thatpermanence is seen as twofold. First of all, there’s the permanence of theeternal mathematical laws of nature considered by Newton and Descartes to beideas in the mind of God—God being a mathematician. The image of God as a kindof transcendent disembodied mathematician containing the mathematical laws ofnature as eternal Ideas is a recurrently popular idea, at least amongmathematicians. The other sort of permanence is in the atoms of matter inmotion. All material objects are supposed to be permutations and combinations ofthese unchanging atoms. The movement they take part in is also permanent andconstant.These permanences are summed up in the principles of conservation of matter andenergy: The total amount of matter is always the same, and so is the totalamount of energy. Nothing really changes at the most fundamental level. Nor dothe laws of nature change. This model of the eternal nature of nature has beenthe basis of physics and chemistry, and to a large extent it is still the basisof physical and chemical thinking.The other theoretical viewpoint is the evolutionary one, which comes to us fromthe Judeo-Christian part of our cultural heritage. According to the biblicalaccount, there is a process in history of progressive development, but thisprocess is confined to the human realm. In the seventeenth century, thisreligious faith was secularized in the notion of human progress through scienceand technology, and by the end of the eighteenth century the idea of humanprogress was a dominant idea in Europe. In the nineteenth century, through thetheory of biological evolution, human evolutionary development came to be seenas part of the progressive evolution of all life.Only in the 1960s did physicists finally abandon their eternal or staticcosmology and come to an evolutionary conception of the universe. With the BigBang theory, the universe became essentially evolutionary. This very recentrevolution in science totally changed our worldview because the most fundamentalthing in science is its cosmology, its basic model of the cosmos.However, if all of nature is evolving, then what about the eternal laws ofnature that scientists have taken for granted for so many centuries? Where werethey before the Big Bang? There was nowhere for them to be, because there was nouniverse. If the laws of nature were all there before the Big Bang, then theymust be nonphysical, idealike entities dwelling in some kind of permanentmathematical mind, be it the mind of God or the Cosmic Mind or just the mind ofa disembodied mathematician. This assumption is something that physicists andmost modern cosmologists have not yet begun to question seriously. It’s an ideathat’s hanging over a theoretical abyss because there’s no compelling reason toassume the laws of nature are permanent in an evolving universe. If the universeis evolving, then the laws of nature may be evolving as well. In fact, the veryidea of the laws of nature may not be appropriate. It may be better to think ofthe evolving habits of nature.The Big Bang theory is like the ancient mythological idea of the cosmosbeginning through the cracking of a cosmic egg and continuing through the growthof the organism that comes out of it. This embryological metaphor is adevelopmental model. It replaces the notion of an eternal machine slowly runningout of steam with the concept of a growing, developing organism thatdifferentiates within itself, creating new forms and patterns. On Earth, thisevolutionary process gives rise to all forms of microbial, animal, and plantlife, as well as to the many and varied forms of human culture.So how does this process happen? In my books A New Science of Life and ThePresence of the Past, I attempt to explain how the habits of nature can evolve.What I suggest is the existence of a king of memory inherent in each organism inwhat I call its morphogenetic or morphic field. As time goes on, each type oforganism forms a specific kind of cumulative collective memory. The regularitiesof nature are therefore habitual. Things are as they are because they were asthey were. The universe is an evolving system of habits.For example, when a crystal crystallizes, the form it takes depends on the waysimilar crystals were formed in the past. In the realm of animal behavior, ifrats are trained to do something in San Francisco, for example, then rats ofthat breed all over the world should consequently be able to do the sameactivity more easily through an invisible influence. There’s already evidence,summarized in my books, that these effects actually occur. This hypothesis alsosuggests that in human learning we all benefit from what other people havepreviously learned through a kind of collective human memory. This is an ideavery like that of Jung’s collective unconscious.Obviously, this is only part of the story. If the universe is a system ofhabits, then how do new patterns come into being in the first place? What is thebasis of creativity? Evolution, like our own lives, must involve an interplay ofhabit and creativity. A theory of evolutionary habit demands a theory ofevolutionary creativity. What gives rise to new ideas, to Beethoven’ssymphonies, to creative theories in science, to new works of art, to new formsof culture, to new instincts in birds and animals, to the evolving forms ofplants and flowers and leaves, to new kinds of crystals, and to all the evolvingforms of galactic, stellar, and planetary organization? What kind of creativitycould underlie all these processes?There seem to be two basic answers on the market. One is the materialisticviewpoint, which says that the whole thing is due to blind chance—that there arenothing but blind material processes going on, and then, by chance, new thingshappen. This viewpoint basically says, “There’s no reason behind it. There’snothing intelligible about it. Creativity just happens,”The other theory is derived from the tradition of Platonic theology. It saysthat everything new that happens and every new form that appears corresponds toan eternal archetype, an eternal Idea in the mind of God, or an eternal formulain the mathematical mind of the cosmos.Evolutionary creativity, however, is creativity that keeps on happening. It goeson as the world goes on. It’s not something that just happened once in an act ofcreation at the beginning of the universe. Another model for understandingcreativity is provided by our own imaginations, which are not full of fixedPlatonic Ideas, but ideas that are ongoing and changing with a creative richnessthat continually surprises us.Could there be a kind of imagination working in nature that is similar to ourown imaginations? Could our own imaginations be just one conscious aspect of animagination working through the whole natural world—perhaps unconsciously as itworks underneath the surface of our dreams, perhaps sometimes consciously? Couldsuch an ongoing imagination be the basis of evolutionary creativity in all ofnature, just as it is in the human realm?These are questions I want to put to you, Terence, because you’ve studied therealm of the imagination more than most of us.Terence: Well, certainly I think that the relationship between creativity andimagination is the place to focus if we want to understand the emergence of formout of disorder. The whole notion of “eternal” laws of nature comes underquestion in the face of the Big Bang. Where were these laws before the Big Bang?One either has to hypothesize a kind of Platonic superspace in which, forreasons unknowable, these laws were present, or say that somehow the laws ofnature came into being complete and entire at the moment of the Big Bang. It’svery hard to see how complex laws of nature such as gene segregation could existin the situation of high-temperature physics and nonmolecular systems thatprevailed at the beginning of the universe. In my thinking about how patternscame to be in the universe, I’ve attempted to take all the orthodox positionsand stand them on their heads. I think it’s a useful way to begin.Is it credible that perhaps the universe is a kind of system in which moreadvanced forms of order actually influence previous states of organization? Thisis what emerges in Ralph Abraham’s work with chaotic attractors. Theseattractors exert influence on less organized states and pull them toward somekind of end state.For me, the key to unlocking what is going on with history, creativity, andprogressive processes of all sorts is to see the state of completion at the endas a kind of higher-dimensional object that casts an enormous and flickeringshadow over the lower dimensions of organization, of which this universe is one.For instance, in the human domain, history is an endless round of anticipation:“The Golden Age is coming”; “The Messiah is immediately around the corner”;“Great change is soon upon us.” All of these intimations of change suggest atranscendental object that is the great attractor in many, many dimensions,throwing out images of itself that filter down through lower dimensionalmatrixes. These shadow images are the basis of nature’s appetite for greaterexpression of form, the human soul’s appetite for greater immersion in beauty,and human history’s appetite for greater expression of complexity.When I think about the terms chaos, creativity, and imagination, I see them as athree-stroke engine of some sort. Each impels and runs the other and sets up areinforcing cycle that stabilizes organisms and conserves processes caught up inthe phenomenon of being. This is a self-synergizing engine whose power emergesout of chaos, moves through creativity, travels into the imagination, returnsback into chaos, then extends out into creativity, and so on. It operates onmany levels simultaneously. The planet is undergoing a destiny.The model we all take for granted—deep time, the time of geology—was onlydiscovered in the nineteenth century. It’s cosmically ennobling to think of theuniverse as a thing of great age, but I think it’s time to put in place, next tothe notion of deep cosmic time, the notion of chaotic sudden change, unexpectedflux, sudden perturbation. As we’ve pushed our understanding of the career oforganic life back nearly three billion years, the study of deep time hasrevealed tremendous punctuation built into the universe. As an example, recallthe asteroid impact that happened sixty-five million years ago from whichnothing on this planet larger than a chicken walked away.The message of deep time is: We may not have as much time as we thought; theuniverse is dynamic, capable of turning sudden corners. This situation demands anew attitudinal response in which imagination is a kind of beacon—a scout sentahead that precedes us into history. Imagination is a kind of eschatologicalobject shedding influence throughout the temporal dimension and throughout themorphogenetic field.If the morphogenetic field is not subject to the inverse square laws thatindicate decreased influence over distance, then I can’t see why it couldn’t belocated at the conclusion of a cosmological process. One of the things that’salways puzzled me about the Big Bang is the notion of singularity. This theorycannot predict behavior outside its domain, yet everything that happens and allour other theories follow from it. The immense improbability that modern sciencerests on, but cares not to discuss, is the belief that the universe sprang fromnothing in a single moment. If you can believe that, then it’s very hard to seewhat you can’t believe. Such intellectual contortions are commonplace in sciencein order to save particular theories.I propose a different idea that I think is eminently reasonable: As thecomplexity of a system increases, so does the likelihood of its generating asingularity or an unpredictable perturbation. I imagine the preexistent state ofthe universe to have been extremely simple, perhaps an unflawed nothingness.This is the least likely situation in which you’d expect a singularity toemerge.If we look at the other end of the historical continuum, at the world we’reliving in, we see tremendously complicated, integrated, multileveled, dynamiccomplexity. And with every passing moment, the world becomes more complex. Thereare 106 elements. There are tremendous gradients of energy ranging from what’sgoing on inside pulsars and quasars to what’s going on inside viruses and cells.There are tremendous organizational capacities at the atomic level, the level ofmolecular polymerization, the level of membranes and gels, the level of cellsand organisms, the level of societies, and so forth.Evolution, history, compression of time—all these things are indications of theincreasing complexity of reality. Is it not reasonable to suspect that asingularity must emerge near the end of the complexification process, ratherthan at its beginning? When we reverse our preconceptions about the flow ofcause and effect, we get a great attractor that pulls all organization andstructure toward itself over several billion years. As the object of itsattraction grows closer to its proximity, the two somehow interpenetrate,setting up standing-wave patterns of interference in which new properties becomeemergent, and the thing complexifies. To my mind, this is the DivineImagination, as Blake called it.Rupert and I were chatting last night in our room about the aboriginal nature ofGod, the idea that somehow time is the theater of God’s becoming. From the pointof view of a higher-dimensional manifold, God’s existence is a kind of faitaccompli. This is a paradox but not necessarily a contradiction, because inthese ontologically primary realms we must avoid closure and hold on to thenotion of a coincidentia oppositorum, a union of opposites. A thing is both whatit is and what it is not, and yet it somehow escapes contradiction. That’s howthe open system is maintained. That’s how the miracle of life and mind ispossible.I think of the Divine Imagination as the class of all things both possible andbeautiful in a kind of reverse Platonism. The attractor is at the bottom of avery deep well into which all phenomena are cascading and being brought into akind of compressed state. This is happening in the biological realm through thecareer of the evolution of life. It’s simultaneously happening in the world aswe experience it within our culture, in what we call history. History is thetrack in the snow left by creativity wandering in the Divine Imagination. In thehistory departments of modern universities, it is taught that this track in thesnow is going nowhere. The technical term is trendlessly fluctuating. We’re toldthat history is a trendlessly fluctuating process: It goes here, it goes there.We just wander around. It’s called a random walk in information theory.This is all very interesting, for we’ve begun to see, through the marvel of thenew mathematics, that random walks are not random at all—that a sufficientlylong random walk becomes a fractal structure of extraordinary depth and beauty.Chaos is not something that degrades information and is somehow the enemy oforder, but rather it is something that is the birthplace of order.Rupert: Your description of the imagination emanating from the cosmic attractorsounds to me like a combination of Plato, Thomas Taylor, and Teilhard deChardin. It resembles the Omega Point that, according to Teilhard, is theattractor of the whole evolutionary process. Everything is being drawn towardthis end point. This is like Aristotle’s conception of God as the prime mover ofthe revolving heavenly spheres. According to him, the heavens were not beingpushed by God, they were being pulled by God. God is so attractive that theheavens keep on going round and round, eternal rotation being the closest theycan come to the divine state of eternal bliss.This idea of attraction has ancient roots, and Teilhard’s is an evolutionaryversion of it. I agree with him and with you, Terence, that we need the notionof an attractor to understand the evolutionary process of the cosmos. This isthe subject of contemporary discussion in the context of the AnthropicCosmological Principle, the idea that the cosmos must have been constituted sothat it allowed the evolution of carbon-based life on at least one planet andthen allowed the evolution of human intelligence so that it could give rise tohuman cosmologists. Other people are a kind of by-product.If there is an attractor in the evolutionary process, which I think there mustbe, then the question is, How does it work in the process of evolutionarycreativity? It could be a kind of future Platonic mind, which is what, you,Terence, seem to suggest. This Cosmic Mind contains all possible forms andarchetypes that are way out there in the future, and it somehow interacts withwhat’s going on now.The way I understand it, there is an ongoing system of habits in the cosmosbuilt up from the past. Habits have a certain density, and matter is densebecause it’s so deeply habitual. There’s a sense in which the sheer materialityof the natural world, and its sheer resistance to the imagination, is due to thefact that everything is so deeply imbedded in habit. Left to themselves, habitswould just fossilize, and the whole world would become intensely, repetitivelyhabitual. But there are other processes going on, such as cosmological expansionand the continued presence of chaos within the universe. This means that habitsare continually being disrupted by accidents—for example, asteroids hitting theEarth. In our own lives, habits are continually being disrupted by developmentalchanges and unexpected accidents, creating vacuums in which new conditions andnew possibilities can happen.As I understand you, you are saying that the needs, the problems, the tensions,the ongoing crises of the present somehow interact with the cosmic attractor atthe end of time, and it’s as if sparks pass between them. Situations or problemsattract to themselves aspects of the divine mind that are appropriate to theirpresent circumstances, creating a kind of imaginative penumbra around what’sactually happening. Similarly, our own imaginations are stimulated by what we’reinterested in, and our dreams reflect our preoccupations and interests andhidden motivations. The evolutionary imagination works by a kind of sparkbetween the divine mind, or cosmic attractor, and present situations open tocreativity.I’m suspicious of the idea that everything that can possibly happen alreadyexists somewhere. This concept denies creativity, reducing it to themanifestation of a future potentiality or possibility that is at the same timeeternal. The final unified attractor and the primal unified state of the BigBang have a symmetrical relationship. They’re both part of the familiar model ofhistory in which the end in some sense reflects the beginning, or the end insome sense is the beginning of a higher turn of the spiral.I’m interested in the possibility that the imagination isn’t all there, allworked out in potential form in advance—the possibility that the world truly ismade up as it goes along. Henri Bergson, in his book Creative Evolution,strongly emphasizes that evolution implies ongoing creativity but that humanbeings will do anything we can to avoid this notion because it’s so extremelydifficult to conceive of ongoing creativity. I agree with him. We either havethe tendency to reject the question by saying ongoing creativity is entirelyrandom so we can’t think about it, or else we substitute some sort of Platonicrealm where everything is already present as an archetype.I’m trying to look at a third possibility in which the imagination, instead ofemerging from the light of the future or from a kind of Platonic mind, mayemerge from something more like the unconscious mind—coming into the light fromdarkness. The formative process of the imagination may not be like sparksleaping from the mind of God but like new forms welling up from the womb ofchaos.Terence: It seems to me the problem revolves around the notion of purpose.Specifically: Is there one? If there is one, what is it? Nineteenth-centuryscience went to great lengths to eliminate purpose from all of its modelbuilding in order to make, once and for all, a clean break from thecontaminating power of deism. For instance, in evolutionary theory the greatbreakthrough in the nineteenth century was the notion of random process. Notknowing that it was background cosmic radiation that drove mutation, scientistsplayed two random processes against each other: what they called “sporting,” orthe production of variant types, and selection based on fitness to theenvironment. When these two random processes are run into each other, anexquisite order emerges—of animals, plants, and ecosystems. Darwinists couldsay, “You see, we have no need for God or purposes or divine plans. We show thatout of the chaos of the moment emerges order.”This tendency was so strong in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century thoughtthat evolutionary biology sought to entirely appropriate the word evolution. Itwas not to be used in any other context. A biologist once said to me, “If itdoesn’t involve genes, it isn’t evolution.” You couldn’t talk about theevolution of the novel, the sonata, or socialism unless it involved genes.Largely through the work of Erich Jantsch, in his books Design for Evolution,Evolution and Consciousness (with C. H. Waddington) and The Self-OrganizingUniverse, this kind of narrow thinking was overthrown.I don’t believe that everything is finished in some deterministic sense at theend of the cosmos. I do believe that there is some kind of intimation of purposethat directs the evolution of processes through time and keeps them from simplybecoming random walks. If we believe that all of the imagination is being madeup in the present, we’re back with the trendlessly fluctuating theorists ofhistory. If none of it exists in the future, then there is no compass point bywhich to guide the process forward.image [images/f0011-01.jpg]Figure 1. A Chreode. Part of an epigenetic landscape, illustrating C. H.Waddington’s concept of chreodes as “canalized pathways of change.” The chreodescorrespond to the valleys and lead to particular developmental endpoints, whichcould, for example, be the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in a flower.C. H. Waddington’s idea of the chreode, described in his book The Strategy ofthe Genes, allows me to preserve your intuitive concept, Rupert, that everythingis being made up as it goes along, as well as my own strong intuitive hit aboutthe necessity for a vector point in the future. This is done by saying that timeis a topological manifold over which events must flow subject to the constraintsof the manifold. I call the surface of this manifold novelty, and I believe thatby examining time from this point of view we can see when in history greatoutbreaks of novelty occurred. What’s important for this argument isthat—without knowing any of its content—we can place the novelty of novelties,the novelty to the nth power of novelty, at the end of the historical processand watch it operate as an attractor without having any information concerningits particulars. This point of view comes very close to Neoplatonism. We have tomaintain the unknowability of God, hence the ultimate unknowability of theimagination. Nevertheless, we have to grant it as an attractor.Rupert: It’s partly a question, as I see it, of what role one thinks theattractor has. One could say, as I think Teilhard or Aristotle conceived it,that the entire cosmic process is drawn toward states of higher unity. Thesestates are not just higher states in general but as many possible states as canbe, which explains why there are so many forms of life. The question is, are thenew forms arising in the attractor, or is the attractor simply attracting what’salready a diversity of forms through a process that lies between them, whichwould be the process of imagination?Terence: As I see it, the attractor is exerting an influence and pulling thesethings toward it, but not in a direct trajectory. They must follow thistopological manifold of time; they have to enter the labyrinth, the intersticesof becoming in order to reach the attractor. That’s why history is so perverse.Two steps forward, one step back is still a prescription for a kind of progress.The Divine Imagination into which history takes us, and which our tools andcultural adaptation clarify and define for us, is something we have been movingtoward rather like someone driving using only the rearview mirror. What isexactly dead ahead of us can hardly be seen. Historical compression increasesdaily throughout global culture until there is almost a sense of free fall intothe deeper fields of the attractor.Rupert: I think we should ask Ralph.Terence: Yes, let’s get Ralph in here.Ralph: I’m trying to see whether imagination and creation are the same ordifferent, and whether you’re having a disagreement or are describing the samething in different ways.The idea of the attractor is related to the problem of the source of new forms.Rupert suggests that new forms come out of chaos, or from the unconscious.There’s still the geometric question, Where are they coming from? Yourdisagreement, as I see it, is in the location of this source of new forms. Arethey projected from an attractor at the end of time, or do they come out of thedynamics working within the field in the evolution and habits of nature? In thisgeometric model of the world’s soul, your only difference, I think, is inperspective. Or perhaps in your idea of time. Behind us is history and in frontof us is possibility. In the determination of the next moment, your conflict isjust a difference of metaphor, not of process. You seem to agree that the nextmoment is created out of the present moment through a process involvingcreativity, imagination, chaos, and a world of possibilities located somewhere.Terence: It occurs to me that creativity might be a lower-dimensional slice ofthe Divine Imagination, a process that seeks to approach this thing that somehowhas an all-at-once completedness about it. Does that fit with your notion ofcreativity as movement toward the realization of a kind of ideal realm?Rupert: I think creativity seems to involve a process like the welling up orboiling up of new forms in an incredible diversity. New forms are conditioned bymemories of what has gone before and by existing habits, but they are newsyntheses, new patterns. There could be a kind of unifying process at work suchthat anything that emerges above the surface of the unconscious or the darknessor the chaos has to take on a kind of wholeness to come above that surface. Ithas to take on a unified form. But it could be any unified form.One model for this creative process is dreaming. Dreams involve the appearanceof stories and symbols and images that we don’t create with our conscious minds.In fact, we usually just forget this whole wonderful display of psychiccreativity that happens for each of us nightly. When we remember our dreams,they’re bizarre and unexpected. It seems almost impossible to have an expecteddream. This curious feature raises the question of where dreams come from. TheJungians would say that they come from structures and processes in the darknessof the collective unconscious. They’d see them not as descending from somehigher world but as welling up.The human imagination obviously works through dreams. It works through language,through conversations, through fantasies, through novels, through visions andinspirations, and it is also revealed through psychedelics in a particularlyextreme form. In what sense is this imagination that we know from our ownexperience related to the imaginative creative principle of nature? Is there akind of Gaian dreaming? For example, is the Earth, Gaia, awake on the side of itthat’s in the sunlight? As it rotates, is the side that’s in the darknessdreaming? At night, are plants, animals, and whole ecosystems in some sense in adream state, when dreams and spontaneous images of what might be possible cometo them? What form would a Gaian dream take? Or what form would a Gaianpsychedelic experience take?Terence: I think a Gaian dream would be human history. Perhaps the planet’s beensleeping for fifty thousand years and is having a dyspeptic dream that causes itto toss and turn. If it could only awaken from that dream, it would just shakeits head and say, “My God, I don’t know what it was, but I hope it doesn’t comeback!” Human history has that quality. James Joyce, in his book Ulysses, hasStephen Dedalus say, “History is the nightmare from which I’m trying to awaken.”The whole structure of Joyce’s novels involves the integration of historicaldata with daily newspapers and that sort of thing to evoke the quality of adream.In mentioning psychedelics, Rupert, you said they revealed an extreme andintense example of this upwelling creativity. I think what they reveal is sointense and extreme an example that it argues strongly that the imagination isnot the human imagination at all. While we may be able to analyze dreams and seethe acting out of wish fulfillment or repressed sexual drives or whatever,depending on our theory of dreams, the psychedelic experience at its intenselevels goes beyond the terms of human motivation. It seems rather to enter anontological reality of its own, one that the human being is simply privileged toobserve briefly. A deep psychedelic experience says no more about a person’spersonality than does the continent of Africa. They are, in fact, independentobjects.To my mind, the Divine Imagination is the source of all creativity in ourdreams, in our psychedelic experiences, in the jungles, in the currents of theocean, and in the organization of protozoan and microbial life. Wherever thereis large-scale integration rather than simply the laws of physics, the creativeprinciple may be beheld.Rupert: Do you think, then, that in psychedelic experiences you’re actuallytapping into the diurnal cosmic imagination?Terence: Absolutely. Psychedelic experiences and dreams are chemical cousins;they are only different in degree. This is how I can see human history as aGaian dream, because I think every night when we descend into dreams, we arepotentially open to receiving Gaian corrective tuning of our life state. Thewhole thing is an enzyme-driven process. We are like an organ of Gaia that bindsand releases energy. A liver cell doesn’t need to understand why it binds andreleases enzymes. Similarly, as humans, we bind and release energy for reasonsperhaps never to be clear to us but which place us firmly within the context ofthe Gaian mind.We have been chosen, just as indole acetic acid has been chosen in plantmetabolism, to play certain roles. We have a role, but our role seems to be amajor one. We are like a triggering system. Out of the general background ofevolutionary processes mediated first by incoming radiation to the surface ofthe Earth and then by natural selection, suddenly we arrive, with our epigeneticcapability to write books, tell stories, sing, carve, and paint. These are notgenetic processes, these are epigenetic processes. Writing, language, and artbind information and express the Gaian mind very well.I see each of us as a cell in communication with the Divine Imagination, whichis sending images back into the past to try and direct us away from areas ofinstability. The Gaian mind is a real mind; its messages are real messages, andour task—through discipline, dreams, psychedelics, attention to detail, whateverwe have going—is to try and extract its messages and eliminate our owninterference so that we can see the face of the Other and respond to what itwants.This isn’t for me a philosophical problem. It’s a problem that relates to thepolitics and action that we take as a collectivity and as individuals.Rupert: The idea that we tune in through our own imaginations to the Gaian mindseems attractive, and I think it fits quite well with dreams, psychedelicexperience, imagination, and so on. The next question for me is this: How is theGaian imagination related to the imagination of the solar system, and that ofthe solar system to the imagination of the galaxy, and that of the galaxy to theimagination of the cosmos, and that of the cosmos related to what we could callthe imagination of the cosmic attractor, or the Omega Point, or the CosmicChrist?Terence: I’m not sure I want to follow you into the Cosmic Christ. I think thereshould always be some physical stuff to hang these things on. The Gaian mind isnot a problem—the Earth teems with life. A Jovian mind is not a problem becausethe complex chemistry and metallic behavior of gas and ice under pressure seemto place enough cards on the table that mind could well emerge in thatsituation. Similarly, the oceans of Europa might be a friendly environment forlife and mind. There are a number of places in the solar system where there’senough complex chemistry that I can imagine that sustained, self-reflectingprocesses might get going over billions of years.However, to move from that level of mind to the hypothesis of a continuoushierarchy of minds, out to the level of the galactic mind, you have to ask hardquestions. How long does it take the galactic mind to think a thought? Does itdo it instantaneously via morphogenetic fields? If so, then what are thetransducing and signal-sorting filters through which the thought travels? Ifthrough light, then to say that the galactic mind’s thoughts are “vaster thanempires and more slow” is to suggest that they are very high-speed phenomenaindeed. Empires would come and go by the hundreds before a galactic thoughtcould reach from one side of itself to the other.Rupert: We don’t know enough to begin to answer these questions. I think afactor that changes everything is the discovery of dark matter—the fact that 90to 99 percent of the matter in the universe is utterly unknown to us. Thisrecent discovery effectively tells us that the cosmos has a kind of unconscious,a dark realm that conditions the formation and shapes of the galaxies, theirinteractions, and everything that’s going on within them. Your search for thebasis of the imagination in the known phenomena of physics is certainly animportant one, but physics itself has revealed that there’s so much more, andthis dark matter could be the basis of any number of processes unknown to us.Terence: I assume that psychedelics somehow change our channel from theevolutionarily important channel giving traffic, weather, and stock marketreports to the one playing the classical music of an alien civilization. Inother words, we tend to tune to the channel that has a big payback in theimmediate world. It seems obvious to me that there are channels of theimagination that are not so tailored for human consumption. I think you’recorrect, that memories and hence all objects of cognition are not in the wetwareof the brain. They are somehow plucked out of a superspace of some sort via verysubtle quantum mechanical transductions that go on at the molecular level. TheDivine Imagination is the reality behind appearance. Appearance is simply thelocal slice of the Divine Imagination.Ralph: In figure 2 [chapter1.html#fig2], I’m presenting a personal map of thepreceding dialogue on creativity and imagination so that we can locate chaos onthe map. Let’s assume there was a beginning and there will be an end. In themeantime there is history, the time wave. There is a present moment also, sothere is a past and a future, and the window of the present is moving along thetime wave. Along the way, the future is being created by the emergence of formsof increasing complexity (according to Rupert) and increasing integrity(according to Terence).image [images/f0017-01.jpg]Figure 2. Three Levels of History. As time advances to the right, three layersof history spring up from a point, The Beginning, and collapse again to a point,The End.There is another level below, at the bottom of the figure, which I am callingchaos, or the Gaian unconscious. This contains not form but the source of form,the energy of form, the form of form, the material that form is made of. Somelittle tinkle comes along like a ringing bell, then a form pops up and becomespart of the time wave.There was also a question that arose briefly in the discussion, before beingrejected forever, on the role of mathematics and natural law. This belongs toanother level of reality, which I have drawn over ordinary reality in figure 2[chapter1.html#fig2].I think there are at least three different levels: ordinary reality, anundercurrent of chaos, and an overworld of law and order. This is noteverything, not yet the full vision that any one of us has had in our ownexplorations of the larger space. These are simply some of the components of alarger thing that is the world soul, the all and everything.There are some difficult questions. Do these other levels really have abeginning and an end, as this discussion has assumed ordinary reality does? Didnatural law exist before the Big Bang, in which matter and energy were created?I put dotted lines and question marks in figure 2 [chapter1.html#fig2] tosuggest these questions, which can be addressed later."},{"pageContent":"image [images/f0020-01.jpg]There’s a cosmic imagination, the imagination of the anima mundi, the soul ofthe universe.

Chaos theory involves three levels, all of which are aspectsof the present rather than of the whole of history as in figure 2[chapter1.html#fig2].In figure 3 [chapter2.html#fig3], the mathematical level is on top. This is thelevel or space of models, things that we do in our minds that create metaphors,images for other things. Ordinary reality is at the bottom level, and includesthe matter and energy world as well as the mental world. This level mightinclude our bodies and minds, the bodies and minds of microbes, and the Gaianbody and mind. These two levels have supported the history of the sciences sinceNewton, or maybe even since Pythagoras, and may correspond to the upper twolevels of the tableau of the preceding dialogue (figure 2 [chapter1.html#fig2]).Recently, a new level has appeared, interpolated between these two levels. Thisis a very interesting half step, created by the computer revolution and thedevelopment of computational mathematics around 1960. This interpolated levelmakes our discussion a little more confusing because the word model now meanseither a mathematical model—for example, an ordinary differential equation—or acomputer program that simulates the mathematical model. The computer model ismore real than the mathematical model but less real than ordinary reality.In this modeling context, there are models for chaotic behavior called chaoticattractors and models for radical transformations of behavior calledbifurcations. From chaotic attractors and their bifurcations, which live on themath level, we gain experience and get a feeling as to the appropriateness of aquestion that might live in the historical realm (figure 2[chapter1.html#fig2])—which is somehow more real than the metaphorical realm(figure 3 [chapter2.html#fig3]). Whether or not, in the Gaian mind, form can bepulled out of chaos by the ringing of a bell or something, we can onlyspeculate. However, there are experiments with mathematical models for chaosthat might be relevant to this question.image [images/f0022-01.jpg]Figure 3. Three Levels of Reality. Three levels of reality at a given moment intime. The mathematical universe is shown above the level of ordinary(consensual) reality of everyday life, matter, and energy, as in the ancientmodel of Plato. But sandwiched in between is a new level, created by thecomputer revolution.For example, a good laboratory for the study of chaotic dynamics is the drippingfaucet. The dripping faucet was discovered as an ideal demonstrator for chaostheory because lectures are usually given in a physics lecture hall and theyalways seem to have sinks and faucets in the front. When you crack the tap alittle bit, the water drips out very regularly. If you crack the tap a littlemore, the drips speed up, but they’re still regular. When you crack it a littlemore, they sound irregular, like rain dripping off a roof. If you measure thetime between drops, and make a list of these numbers, you have the paradigmaticexample of a chaotic time series.Somebody decided to study this dripping faucet seriously after seeing it inphysics lectures. This person, Rob Shaw, is now one of the leading people inchaos theory. He did a very fine study by placing a microphone in the sink wherethe drop would hit it, getting an electronic beep putting the time intervalsinto his computer, and analyzing the results. These portions of his study allbelonged to level one, the lowest layer of figure 3 [chapter2.html#fig3], thephysical world. Then he made a model for the dripping faucet on level three. Inthis mathematical model, the water drop gets bigger and bigger, and when itsmass reaches a critical value the drop falls off the faucet. From this model onlevel three, Shaw wrote a computer program to simulate it, which was a model onlevel two. He ran the simulator and produced data that was almost exactly likethe experimental data from the actual faucet on level one. Opening the model’stap eventually changed the simulated data from periodic to chaotic through abifurcation.This is an example of modeling in the three-level context. The point of thiskind of modeling is to gain understanding as part of a hermeneutic circle. Youlook at the data, try to build a model, and you fail. You then observe in adifferent way, which helps you to build a better model, and, as the circleturns, the level of your understanding grows, This is what Rob Shaw did with thedripping faucet. The different way of observing data that came to him from themodel was a method now known as chaoscopy. In this method, you take the sequenceof numbers—the time between drops—and visualize a vertical column of numbers.Then you make a copy of this column of numbers over to the right. You whack onenumber off the top of this second column and move the entire column up onenumber. Now you have a column of pairs of numbers. Then you plot these pairs ina plane figure as a series of points.There’s a film available from Aerial Press that shows a machine actually doingthis. From totally chaotic data viewed in this particular way, throughchaoscopy, you get a set of points in a plane. If the data were really random,the dots would be all over the plane. Instead they lie along a smooth curve!This indicates a chaotic attractor.A hidden order in chaos is revealed by a new way of looking. From theobservation of the data in this way, the smoothness of the curve suggests, to achaos theorist, a model that you can actually take off the shelf and apply toother data. There are models on level three that are good for understandingcertain behavior on level one. On level two, an intermediary can either createthe mathematical model on level three from the real data of level one, or createsimulated data from the mathematical model to compare with the real data.I have, I hope, arrived at an actual connection between chaos theory and thediscourse we’re trying to carry on here to increase our understanding of ourpast, our future, and our possibility of even having a future.Rupert: The problem I have with chaos theory is that I’m never quite sure whatit’s saying. There seem to me to be two things that are of interest in it. Oneis the actual detailed models that chaos theoreticians make. These theoreticiansare finding fairly simple equations that will generate complicated and seeminglychaotic structures. The other aspect of interest is more general. Those who makemathematical models of chaos have given scientists permission to recognize thatin fact there’s an inherent indeterminacy throughout the physical world.In the nineteenth century, it was generally believed there was no indeterminacyat all. Everything was believed to be totally determined by eternal laws ofnature. Laplace thought that the whole future and past of the universe could becalculated from its present state if there were a mind powerful enough to do thecalculations and make the observations. This illusion of total predictabilityheld science under its spell for generations. Scientists were dazzled by itsimaginary power. Of course, they couldn’t calculate everything and they stillcan’t. Far from predicting the entire future of everything, they still can’tpredict the weather very accurately a few days from now. The ideal of totalpredictability in principle was no more and no less than an act of faith.With quantum mechanics, in 1927, came a recognition of genuine indeterminism innature. Since then, there’s been a gradual recognition that indeterminacy existsnot only at the quantum level but at all levels of natural organization. There’san inherent spontaneity and indeterminism and probability in the weather, in thebreaking of waves, in turbulent flow, in nervous systems, in living organisms,in biochemical cycles, and in a whole range of phenomena. Even the old-timefavorite model for total rational mathematical order, the orbits of the planetsin the solar system, turns out to be chaotic and unpredictable in terms ofNewtonian physics. This indeterminism is now being recognized at all levels ofnature.It seems to me that this openness of nature, this indeterminism, thisspontaneity, this freedom, is something that corresponds to the principle ofchaos in its intuitive and mythological senses. Mathematicians have used theword chaos in a variety of technical senses, and it’s not entirely clear to mehow these technical models of chaotic systems correspond to intuitive notions ofchaos.What I’d like to consider, through a familiar physical process such as cooling,is the way in which form appears out of chaos. If you start with something at avery high temperature, atoms don’t exist in it. Electrons fly off the nuclei andyou get a plasma, which is sort of a soup of atomic nuclei and electrons, withits own distinctive properties. If you cool the plasma to a certain temperature,atoms begin to form. Electrons start circulating around nuclei, and you get agas of atoms. But the temperature is still too high for any molecules to form.If you cool it down further, you get molecules. If you cool the system down evenfurther, you get a stage at which more complex molecules come into being. Still,they’re gaseous. Cool it down further, and they turn into a liquid that can formdrops and flow around and have quite complex, ordered arrays of molecules withinit. Cool it further, and you get a crystal that is a highly ordered, formalarrangement of atoms and molecules. You get a progressive increase in complexityof form as you lower the temperature.In traditional kinetic theory, lowering temperature gives less random kineticmotion of particles; there is less chaos and an increase in complexity of formas the cooling process takes place. We all know about the cooling of steam intowater and the cooling of water into ice crystals, as in snowflakes and frost.This formative process occurs as thermal chaos is reduced. The opposite happensif you warm things up. So there seems to be an inverse relationship betweenchaos and form.In a sense, that’s what’s happened in the entire universe. We’re told that theuniverse started off exceedingly hot—billions of billions of degrees centigrade.It was so hot that stable forms were not able to emerge. By expanding, it cooleddown. When it was cool enough, atoms emerged, then stars and galaxies condensed,then solar systems and planets. Planets are the cooled remnants of explodingstars. The elements in us and in our planet are stardust, formed fromsupernovas. The evolutionary appearance of form comes about through cooling;form emerges progressively from chaos.How do these new forms come into being? This is the big problem of evolutionarycreativity. How did the first zinc atoms come into being? The first methanemolecules, the first salt crystals, the first living cells, the firstvertebrate? How did the first of anything come into being in this evolvinguniverse?One way of looking at this problem is to see the expansion and cooling process,and indeed the flow of events in general, in terms of the flux of energy. Theconcept of energy, which is one of the great unifying concepts of physics, wasformulated in the nineteenth century. It’s not entirely clear what energy is. Insome sense it is the principle of change. The more energy there is, the morechange that can be brought about. In this sense, it is a causative principlethat exists in a process. This process, the energetic flux of the universe,underlies time, change, and becoming, and it seems to possess inherentindeterminism. The energetic flow is organized into forms by fields. Matter isnow thought of as energy bound within fields—the quantum matter fields and thefields of molecules and so on.I think there are many of these organizing fields that I call the morphicfields, and that they exist at all levels of complexity. These fields somehoworganize the ongoing flux of energy that is always associated with chaoticqualities. Even organized systems of a high level of complexity, such as humanbrains, have this probabilistic quality. The fields that organize this energygiving rise to material and physical forms are themselves probabilistic. Chaosis never eliminated. There’s always an indeterminism or spontaneity at alllevels of organization.There are two principles: a formative principle, which is the fields, and anenergetic principle. Energy is the principle of change, and pure change would bechaos. One way of thinking of these two principles is in terms of the IndianTantric notion of Shakti as energy and Shiva as the formative principle workingtogether to create the world we know. If the formative principle operatesthrough the fields of nature, then how do these fields operate? How are thesefields governed? How do they have the forms, shapes, and properties they do?I think the organizing fields of organisms are what I call morphic fields, andthat these fields contain an inherent memory. They are essentially habitual, andnature is the theater in which these habitual fields organize the indeterminateflux of energy. The fields themselves, by having this energy within them, sharethis indeterminate quality also.This brings us to the question of creativity. How do new fields and new formscome into being in the first place? Where do they come from? This morning,Terence and I were discussing how they may arise out of the interaction of chaosand some kind of formative, unifying aspect of the cosmic mind, which you,Ralph, hijacked for the Pythagorean sect by calling it the realm of mathematics.There’s an interaction between these two levels, which you’ve shown by thewiggly line in the middle of your diagram, indicating the world of becoming.This brings us back to the nature of what you call the mathematical realm andwhat I call the formative realm. Is there a kind of mathematical realm for theuniverse, somehow beyond space and time altogether, which conditions all formsof creativity and all patterns and possible systems of organization that comeinto being in the world? Or are these all made up as the evolutionary processgoes along? These are questions Terence and I touched on in our dialogue oncreativity and the imagination [chapter 1 [chapter1.html#ch1]].I think if we take the view that things come into being as evolution goes alongand that the cosmic soul has a kind of imagination, then we can think of form ascoming into being through the imagination as nature goes along, and we can seethis imagination as having many levels. There’s a cosmic imagination, theimagination of the anima mundi, the soul of the universe. Within this are theimaginations of galaxies, solar systems, planets, ecosystems, societies,individual organisms, organs, tissues, and so on. There are many levels oforganizing souls and imaginations. We don’t have to leap straight from the levelof a molecule or a plant cell to the level of Divine Imagination, or to thetranscendent realm of mathematics. There’s a whole series of imaginations inbetween.My view is that there isn’t a kind of mathematical mind out there, alreadyfixed, already full. What people do is make mathematical models of variousaspects of nature and then project these models on nature, creating the illusionthat they’re the real thing. The result is that the cosmic imagination seems tobe engulfed within an eternal mathematical mind, when it may be no moremathematical than human beings are when we’re dreaming. We do not experience ourdreams as being generated by equations, or as essentially mathematical innature.What I’m suggesting is that the cosmic imagination might include within it amathematical realm, and that this mathematical aspect is evolving just as ourown understanding of mathematics is evolving in time.Ralph: I don’t see that mathematics is substantially different from verbaldescription as a strategy for making models. For example, I described ageometric, visual model for the all-and-everything, including within it theworld soul and so on. If drawn as a geometric picture instead of a word picture,that’s officially mathematics—that’s geometry. I think that with mathematics wecan make a model for anything. Mathematics can be regarded as simply anextension of language. It’s not a code of laws describing the universe, althoughthat is its usual paradigm.Mathematics is a particularly good language for describing, discussing, andimagining things that are really complicated. The more complex a structure, themore difficult it is to embrace with our minds. Words are frequently inadequate.Language has evolved through the necessity of sharing our experiences on a levelof complexity that is more or less traditional and that is inadequate tounderstand the whole world, or the world soul, or the biosphere of planet Earth.Mathematics has only a little more magic than ordinary language.Rupert had a complaint about chaos theory, about determinism and prediction.According to chaos theory, prediction and determinism are impossible! Eventhough it uses the language that deterministic thinkers use, with respect to itstechnical details, there is only a sort of probalistic prediction.The models for the things you want to talk about, such as cooling, don’t comefrom chaos theory alone. They come from bifurcation theory, which exemplifiesthe best of mathematics. Mathematics says that, based on particular assumptions,certain things will not happen and only certain other things will. You get alist of three or four of these so-called bifurcations. With cooling, forexample, you may have a control knob with which you are turning down the heatunder a pan. The boiling gradually subsides to simmering, which subsides to alittle bit of waving, which subsides to nothing. At each stage, based on themathematics, there is a model that has attractors, maybe chaotic attractors.Every time you change the knob, you get a different model. Therefore, if youcan’t predict how the knob is going to change, the models won’t give anyprediction at all. The only thing bifurcation theory can tell you is to expectcertain transformations.For example, Terence has pointed to the punctual aspect of evolution—the factthat many transformations are saltatory, catastrophic, abrupt. Bifurcationtheory simply says that, in models of this type, most of the transformations areabrupt. It says that determinism, even probalistic determinism, is impossibleusing these mathematical models. There is an encyclopedia of bifurcations thatare very good models for transformations, for the emergence of form as in theNeolithic revolution or the formation of the solar system.Bifurcation theory can be used to model everything, so it never settles thequestion of the origin of things or the true nature of ordinary reality. Likelanguage, it’s good for communication; it’s good for understanding, becausemodeling is part of our basic process of understanding. Models are no good forprediction, but they’re good for the growth of understanding.Rupert: You put the whole case impressively and modestly in claiming thatmathematicians are just making models. Chaos theory provides a new range ofmodels. We can look forward to more models coming onto the market in the future.I suspect the traditional assumption is that successful models work becausethere are mathematical aspects of nature to which they mysteriously relate. Ioften meet mathematicians or physicists who say quantum physics is the mostbrilliant predictive system that mankind has ever known, predicting things tomany places of decimals. When I was working in India as an agriculturalscientist, there was no one who could predict the outcome of my cropexperiments. Crops growing in fields were miles beyond the capabilities of anymodeling process based on the fundamental principles of physics. One couldproduce empirical, string-and-sealing-wax models for crop production and runthem on computers, but none of them provided to me a convincing demonstrationthat the whole thing depended on a hidden mathematical order.Are the fields of nature more real than the mathematical models we make of them,or is there a kind of mathematics yet more fundamental than the fields? Forexample, take the polarities of the electromagnetic field: north and southmagnetic poles, and positive and negative electric charges. Do these polaritiesexist because of some fundamental Two Principle, an archetypal duality behindand beyond nature? Or is that just the way fields are? When we look at a widerange of polar phenomena, we make an abstraction that we can then modelmathematically, but it doesn’t exist in some objective, transcendent realm.Ralph: You could ask different mathematicians and get different answers. I’llgive you mine, and other mathematicians will say it doesn’t count because I’mnot a mathematician, and my answer is the proof of that.For me, mathematics is a beautiful landscape, an alternate reality, filled withpossibilities not yet seen. There are some older and some younger parts in themathematical landscape, and this entire system is in coevolution with ordinaryreality as people enter and hang out there to study and invest their creativeenergy. In this mathematical landscape, there is only a small part that has beenused for modeling anything in ordinary reality.From the viewpoint of a nonmathematician, the part of mathematics that has beenused for modeling something familiar, like the simmering of hot water, is theonly part visible. Nonmathematicians may exclaim about the amazingly perfect fitbetween a mathematical concept evolved solely in the human mind and a boilingpot of water. This part of mathematics became visible primarily during thehistory of physics, which is devoted to the study of the simplest possiblesystems.When you talk about your experience as an agricultural scientist, you aretalking about a realm that is infinitely more complicated than the most complexphysical system. The parts of mathematics that have been used by physicists arethe parts that are the least interesting to mathematicians. Mathematics offersmuch more to the complex sciences than it offers to physics. The whole potentialof mathematics to aid us in our evolution comes from the fact that it can extendour understanding of systems that are too complex to understand without it, aswhen a small change in the weather causes some peas to grow at the expense ofothers.In an ecosystem, there are so many different things. We can’t be sure that asingle oil spill off a single coast could not produce desertification or bringon the equivalent of nuclear winter. Our understanding can be advanced bymathematics, because mathematics is an extension of language for dealing withcomplex systems. We can have models of emotional relationships, of love affairs,of arms races between nations, or the United Nations. We can model these thingswith models that are not perfect, but they’re better than no models. Theconstruction of these models is part of our evolution, and it’s part of theevolution of the mathematical landscape as well.Rupert: I must admit that my interest in mathematical models has enormouslyincreased since I came across attractors. No one in any other branch of sciencehas been able to think in terms of teleological principles that pull from infront. You, Ralph, have done more than any mathematician I know to make theessential features of this kind of mathematics accessible. There’s not a singleequation in your four volumes on visual dynamics. Through diagrams, you give theessence of what dynamic systems are. Normally, mathematical ideas are hiddenbehind an opaque cloud of symbols that most of us can’t penetrate. It’s as ifour only experience of music was looking at the scores of symphonies withoutever actually hearing the symphonies themselves. These symbols refer to thingsthat for real mathematicians are visual intuitions.Attractors have really changed our way of thinking about nature because they’vemade it possible to think about what Aristotle called the entelechy, the endthat attracted toward itself the process of change. What I’d like to know is howyou think attractors work. No matter how we try to get out of it, they seem toimply a pulling from in front rather than a pushing from behind, something thatis more Aristotelian than mechanistic. At the cosmological level, we arrive atwhat Terence and I were discussing this morning—the idea of an attractor for theentire cosmic evolutionary process.Ralph: I have to admit that when I heard this from both of you my jaw dropped. Iwas astonished at this interpretation, and I can’t say it’s wrong, but I’m sureit’s different from the way any mathematician has thought about attractors indynamical systems before.Imagine a train going down a track, and it’s going to get to the next station inseven minutes. Is the station pulling the train? The dynamical system is thetrack, the present moment is the train, and the attractor is the station. Thisattractor might not be simply a point—it might be a circular section of track,or it might be a tangled heap of track, a chaotic attractor. The idea of theattractor pulling the train may be suggested by the word attractor. When wethought of this word in the early 1960s, we never thought it would beinterpreted in this way. Now I can see that it’s the obvious interpretationanyone would make when they read this word.Rupert: The same problem was confronted by Sir Isaac Newton, when he chose theword attraction for gravitation. When Voltaire visited London in 1730, more thanforty years after Newton had published his ideas, these ideas were still notaccepted in France for the principal reason that Newton had used the wordattraction, with its connotations of sexual attraction and its animistic andsubjective associations. The idea that the Earth could be attracting a stonelike an attractive woman attracts a man seemed ridiculous. Voltaire said that ifNewton had chosen a different word his theories would have been adopted thirtyyears earlier.The truth is that mechanistic cosmology replaced animistic cosmology throughintroducing animistic principles such as gravitational “attraction” bysubterfuge, pretending that they were mechanical principles. In Aristotle’s viewof the world, stones fell because they were attracted to the Earth; they wereattracted to their proper place; they were going home. Newtonian physics saidthat it was completely wrong to think of nature working on the basis of suchattractions. Instead, stones fell because of “gravitational attraction”! Isn’tattraction a strange concept to use if one is trying to deny attraction? TheNewtonian tried to forget about animistic associations and pretended that thiswas just a neutral technical term.In the evolution of science since the mechanistic revolution, attraction hasbeen reinvented again and again. I suspect that the same is true, Ralph, of yourdynamical attractor. Choosing the words attraction or attractor gives the ideaan inherent appeal and plausibility.I think that even if you take your example of the train, the station may not bepulling the train, but there’s a sense in which the station really is anattractor. I get on a train that’s going to London because it’s my purpose to goto London. In a sense, what’s motivating the train is the purpose of the peoplegetting to London or New York or Los Angeles. Unless human beings are purposiveand have destinations they want to get to, and unless railway companies haveschedules and plan the way they run the trains in accordance with supply anddemand, the train won’t run. The train can be modeled as if it’s just adynamical system running along rails that happen to end up in London. If youobserve enough trains on the London railway line, you see lots of them going toLondon, so you put London in the model as an attractor, but at the same time yousay the destination has nothing to do with attraction. This is, in my opinion, asubterfuge, because it has a great deal to do with attraction. If there arerailway lines running nowhere in particular, very few people travel on them, andafter a while …Ralph: They have no stations.Rupert: Railway companies close them down because they say there’s no demand. Inthis example, and even in your own, Ralph, there is an implication of attractorsreally attracting.Ralph: It’s a good analogy with Newton’s gravitational attraction. With histheory, and equally with general relativity, there are some unresolved difficultproblems about action at a distance in space. I think we have the same thinghere, but it’s a question of action at a distance in time. Two different kindsof time have been confused here.The train goes down the track and arrives at the station, the attractor, but theproblem with thinking of the station pulling the train is that the cause is thenin the future. Your argument that the station pulls the train because the peoplewant to go there applies to a different kind of time—time on the longer scale ofthe evolution of the whole train system. People used to get on and off trainswhere there were no stations; they just asked the conductors to stop the trains.After many people asked for a certain stop, the railway built a train stationthere.The interesting model here is the dynamical model for the evolution of the trainsystem itself, with its various tracks and stations and even with the locationof towns and so on. All of this evolves slowly in the course of another kind oftime, measured in centuries. This slow evolutionary train also goes toward anattractor, which includes the location of cities, the network of train tracksand stations, and so on. Is this slow train being pulled by the attractor? Ithink not, because people are exerting their will by getting on and off the fasttrain wherever they want, and that’s the motor of the slow train. Thedeterminant of evolution is free will in the moment, the collective action ofcitizens in the present.Rupert: We face this problem in human psychology. You see, motivations in theordinary psychological sense are not pushing from behind but pulling from ahead.In courts of law seeking to establish the cause of what happened in a crime,motivation is very important. Did so-and-so willfully murder so-and-so? What wastheir motive? There’s a sense in which a future state or an imagined futurestate is pulling them. We all have desires and goals that motivate us; we havepurposes and aims. All of us at this workshop had the intention of getting toEsalen this weekend, and the intention preceded our coming here. The goal ofbeing here drew our behavior toward it. That goal was in the future.The concept of morphic attractors in morphic resonance theory, like the conceptof entelechy in Aristotle’s notion of the soul, tries to deal with the fact thatsomehow the system, the person, the developing animal, the developing plant, orwhatever is subject in the present to the influence of a potential future statethat hasn’t yet come into being. That potential future state is what directs andguides and attracts the development of the system in the present.Is that future state existing in the present in some other dimension ordirection or time, or is it actually out there in the future pulling fromtomorrow or the day after tomorrow through time? There are different ways toimagine how it works.Ralph: We’ve arrived again at the imagination.Rupert: Exactly. Over to Terence.Terence: I have a lot to say about this discussion, and I’ll work backwardthrough it.Alfred North Whitehead had a phrase, “appetition for completion,” which I taketo be what this attracting notion is seeking—completion, that is. If we didn’tuse the word attractor and tried to be true to the notion that the process wasbeing pushed from behind, we would have to use a word like propeller ormotivator. These seem to me, intuitively, to be inelegant terms. Theyimmediately raise questions of operational detail that attractor doesn’t. Weknow when things are attracted to something; they simply move toward it. Ifsomething is “propelled” toward something or “motivated” toward something, wehave to visualize it strapped to an engine that is moving it toward an endstate, which, somehow it is able to magically locate.If you view the attractor as the bottom of an energy well, then anything putinto the energy well will make its way to the attractor because the attractor isthe least energetic state. The whole system naturally tends to move in thatdirection. The idea that the cause is in the future makes hash of theconventional notion of causality, so it’s something that science is very keen todiscredit. The backwash from the acceptance of this idea would make the practiceof science much more difficult.For many years, Ralph and his colleagues have been modeling plant growth,dripping faucets, coupled oscillators like groups of cuckoo clocks hung on thewall, and this sort of thing. The modeling challenge for the future is humanhistory. We will no longer be playing little games to demonstrate something to agroup of students or colleagues, but we will actually be proposing models andmethods powerful enough to begin to model the real world. These models will dealnot only with the real world of biology, but with the real world of the feltexperience of being embedded in human institutions.I think the whole reason history has been bogged down during the twentiethcentury is because of an absence of belief in an attractor. The legacy ofexistentialism and the philosophies constellated around it is the belief thatthere is no attractor, no appetition for completion. Everything is referent tothe past up through the present and goes no further.My tendency is to carry any principle to its ultimate extrapolation. In thinkingabout complexity in relation to falling temperature I glimpsed something I hadpreviously overlooked.If, in fact, the increase in complexity in life is directly related to fallingtemperatures in the universe, then it seems reasonable to suppose that the mostcomplex states in future cosmic history will occur at very low temperatures.It’s interesting that a phenomenon like superconductivity, which is fascinatingto solid-state engineers as a way to preserve information from decay, occurs atlow temperatures. If you put information into a superconducting circuitoperating at around absolute zero, it’s impossible to disrupt that circuitwithout destroying it. As early as the mid thirties, people like ErwinSchroedinger suggested that, since life seeks to stabilize itself againstmutation, the obvious principle to aid in that task would be something very muchlike superconductivity.In fact, the way in which charge transfer and things like that occur in DNAsuggests that nature may have incorporated this principle into its mechanics.What this tells us in the present is that our current cultural phase transitionvis-á-vis machines may signify that we are not, as I’ve always thought, veryclose to the maximized state of novelty. Rather we may be somewhere out in themiddle of the topological manifold I call the “novelty wave,” which goes fromthe beginning to the end of all things. The cultural transition that we areexperiencing is a downloading of all novelty so far achieved into a much colderand stabler regime of silicon crystals and arsenic-doped chips and this sort ofthing. This is a fairly appalling idea, because we all have a horror of beingreplaced by machines. On the other hand, procaryotes were replaced byeucaryotes, and there have been several other replacement scenarios in thehistory of life.This point about cooling and complexity seems to imply, in my own theory of the“time wave,” that the zero point attractor at the end of time may in fact be theabsolute zero point, and that what the time wave or the fractal time manifoldreally describes is the fluctuation of the career of heat throughout the life ofthe universe. In domains of high heat, information is degraded and novelty islost, and there is a kind of recidivist tendency. When temperatures fall, orderreasserts itself and things stabilize.In the wake of each ice age, human populations emerged with better tools, betterlanguages, and better techniques than before. It was as if the increasedenvironmental pressure, and perhaps even the increased need to spend more timetogether, synergized the emergence of higher states of order.We associate lower temperatures with death. We all understand that iftemperatures drop below a certain very narrow range, that’s it for us. Themachines we are creating, however, are operating more and more efficiently astemperature is dropped. In the realm of absolute zero, almost miraculous thingscan be imagined in the way of technical storage and retrieval of information.Ralph: Terence, what is the optimal environment for biological informationstorage?Terence: A very cold regime is optimal for mushroom spores. The actualexpression of the spores’ genomes through the growing of fungi has to occur in anormal biological regime, but spores stored in liquid nitrogen can be storedindefinitely. In fact, most tissue can be stored indefinitely at these lowtemperatures. It’s not very interesting to be at 70° Kelvin, but it is the pathtoward a kind of immortality because that’s where preservation takes place.Rupert: The idea of information storage at low temperatures is interesting whenwe consider the difference between spoken and written language. The firstwritten languages we know about were written on rocks, the ultimate,low-temperature, crystalline storage system. For example, the Ten Commandmentsgiven to Moses were on tablets of stone. Writing on rock is a kind of permanentstorage system. Putting things in silicon crystals is more sophisticated but isstill essentially a low-temperature storage method. You can’t write on water oron the wind.Written language creates the illusion for us of an independent world. The notionof a transcendent eternal world of Forms couldn’t have arisen until writtenlanguage did, because written language provides the model for it. By what Ithink of as a kind of idolatry, human-made symbols and structures, when writtendown, are imagined to endure forever in some other realm. Spoken language is farolder than written language, but is a process that happens in time. The memoryinvolved in oral cultures is carried in stories that are continually retold andthat evolve as they are transmitted. The spoken record, the story, developsorganically as time goes on, and there’s nobody around to say, “Well, you’ve gotthe story wrong; in the book it’s written like this.”Spoken and written language provide us with different models of reality. Oraltradition has an evolving and yet conservative quality, and suggests a model ofreality rooted in habit and tradition yet open to the creative imagination. Themodel of written language projects the idea of things being fixed by beingwritten down and gives the impression of a realm of eternal Forms or formulae.Ralph: I imagine, just to be contrary, that mathematics probably preceded notonly writing but language as well. Certainly mathematics preceded writing. Inmathematics there are, for example, the circle and the line, which were, forPlato, ideal, eternal Forms. Do we need writing on stone to think of a line or acircle or a triangle as being an eternal Form? The evolution of this kind ofmathematics was probably achieved by people drawing in sand. Writing evolvedfrom this drawing in sand, and only later did we begin drawing on stone. It’spossible that the idea of eternal Forms, laws, and so on emerged before writingon stone, and that writing on stone was just a concretization of those ideas.This suggests a migration in evolution from the immaterial to the material, fromthe abstract to the concrete, which is opposite to what a lot of people think.Terence: To summarize this dialogue, the concept of the attractor was introducedand explored in detail, probably to the clarification of at least two of theparticipants, Rupert and myself. The role of the attractor seems central tounderstanding what chaos dynamics is offering that is new. Rupert dwelt on thevery useful analogy of the way in which order is attained through phasetransition. He chose the model of cooling, both in the specific case of thecooling of a liquid and in the case of the whole cosmos as a slowly coolingsolution going through phase transitions from lower to higher states of order asthe temperature falls.Ralph then raised the stakes in an attempt to communicate the complexity of whatchaos dynamics is saying. He went beyond the notion of the attractor and thebasin of attraction and introduced the idea of bifurcation, which is a furtherdevelopment in the metaphor. The fruitfulness of, aesthetics of, and constraintson the process of modeling were discussed, as was the way in which modelingallows us to build up provisional pictures of reality into which we canestablish correctional feedback loops. These feedback loops allow us to navigatetoward ever clearer images of the system we have targeted for modeling. Alsotouched upon were ways in which new forms emerge out of the natural order andways in which they are stabilized in time.The longer we talk, the more creation, imagination, and chaos all seem to be thesame thing, and there’s a kind of melding of these concepts. One can play anyrole and find that it’s very much like the role one has just left behind. Thismeans we are succeeding; that the separate notions we each represent areannealing."},{"pageContent":"image [images/f0040-01.jpg]Repression of chaos results in an inhibition of creativity and thus a resistanceto imagination.

My appreciation of this resonancehas increased over the past years. I am a devotee of chaos, but not only on themathematical plane. I should like now to speak about chaos in ordinary life andthe relationship of this chaos to the imagination. Along the way, I’ll try toexplain why I think that chaos theory is the biggest thing since the wheel.Terence has emphasized the importance of chaos and fractals in his own thinking.I’ll provide a further reason to regard the chaos revolution as good news.Somebody came to me last year and gave me a splendid quote, knowing I waswriting a nontechnical book on Chaos, Gaia, and Eros: “All creation begins inchaos, progresses in chaos, and ends in chaos.” The word chaos occurred for thefirst time in Hesiod, around 800 B.C., at the beginning of the Orphic traditionof ancient Greece. The word appeared in his Theogony, which was about thecreation of the gods and goddesses one by one. The three main deities wereChaos, Gaia, and Eros.This first time the word appeared in literature, it had nothing to do with whatwe now mean by chaos in the English language and in ordinary life. At that time,it meant a sort of gaping void between heaven and Earth out of which formemerged. Creation came out of chaos, but chaos did not mean disorder or anythingnegative; it only meant a gaping void.Proper nouns such as these in Greek literature don’t mean people or humanoidgods; they’re abstract principles, particularly in Homer and Hesiod and in theOrphic literature. The three I am discussing—Chaos, Gaia, and Eros—are cosmicforces: Chaos is a sky concept; Gaia is an Earth concept; Eros is a spiritconcept. Whereas Chaos and Gaia are feminine in Hesiod, Eros is bisexual, anandrogyne. These are abstract concepts of the sky, the earth, and the creativetension in between them; they are like the body, the soul, and the spirit of theworld.The most obvious feature in the sky is the Milky Way. When it is overhead, itappears as a kind of gap between the two sides of the sky. The sky is sort oflike an Easter basket with the ecliptic around the waist, like a snake. All thatis below the waist is considered the Underworld. All above it is the Overworld,or ordinary reality. There is a handle across the top that is the Milky Way,which passes right through the middle of the Overworld as the royal road for thegods traveling between the Underworld and the Overworld.The Milky Way looks like a fractal photograph, the prototypical chaos in thesense of randomness or disorder. Understanding this, we can connect the wordwith an earlier word, a proper noun, and cosmic concept that represents what wesee in the Milky Way itself. That noun is “Tiamat,” the goddess of chaos fromEnuma Elish, the great epic poem of Babylonian literature. This poem is acreation story about the origin of the gods and the creation of the world byTiamat and Apsu, the goddess and god of chaos who lived in the water. These twodeities created the pantheon of gods and goddesses and the whole world. Later,Marduk, a younger god in the next generation, appeared, and there was conflictbetween the older and the younger gods over how the world ought to be run.Apparently this conflict represented a social transformation, the demotion ofApsu and Tiamat from the pantheon of the city of Babylon. Marduk became the maingod, Mister Big, of Babylon, around 2000 B.C., coinciding with the sweep ofpatriarchy over that city, propelled on a new type of war chariot with spokedinstead of solid wheels.Terence: You’ve reached the wheel.Ralph: The wheel itself, as a mathematical model, is the paradigm of order.Order has come to mean a process that is either static or periodic, regularlychanging in a cycle. In short, according to the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish,Tiamat (chaos) was killed, ripped to pieces to create a new world order by thehero of Babylon, Marduk. His New Year’s celebrations were honored all over oldEurope, including even Stonehenge. At the New Year’s festivals, the epic poemwas read as an annual reminder that chaos was bad and was killed and replaced byan order associated with periodicity, cycles, the wheel, perfect roundness, andso on. For two thousand years, this poem was read every year in a celebrationlasting eleven days called the Akitu festival in Babylon. There were almostidentical festivals in Egypt, Crete, and Canaan.All of this reveals the importance of today’s chaos revolution. Chaos isrecovering from being banished to the unconscious since around 2000 B.C., or so.It has suffered four thousand years of repression. To this day, in our culture,we think we have to watch out for chaos; it has to be replaced by order.Scientists most especially hate it. Today; Tiamat finally has to be accepted asa friend and reinstated upon her throne. This is big news.Now, about the imagination. So far in our discussions, we have developed theconnection between creativity and the imagination and the one between chaos andcreativity; thus, we have made an indirect connection between chaos and theimagination. I’m going to try to make a direct link between chaos and theimagination, as shown in figure 4 [chapter3.html#fig4].image [images/f0043-01.jpg]Figure 4. Our Trinity. The triangle of roles adopted by the authors for thefirst four trialogues.Repression of chaos results in an inhibition of creativity and thus, aresistance to imagination. The creative imagination, manifest most profoundly bypeople like Euler or Bach, should be functioning in everyone. People have aresistance to their own creative imagination. I’m suggesting that thisresistance has a mythological, ritual, base. It represents a very deep chreode,a runnel in the morphogenetic field with a depth of three to five Waddingtons.Terence: Waddingtons?Ralph: Rupert and I wanted to quantify the depth of a runnel. Since C. H.Waddington introduced the chreode concept in connection with embryology, asRupert has explained, we thought it appropriate to take his name for a unit ofdepth in the morphogenetic field.Habits, according to Rupert, are runnels. They are deeply worn paths in themorphogenetic field. Habit itself is a habit. We have a habit of having habits.The habit of habits has a mathematical model called by Waddington a chreode.This chreode is an attractor and its basin (figure 1 [chapter1.html#fig1]). Anystate in the basin moves toward the attractor. The attractor is the teleology ofits habit. The habit of habits is the habit of living in a landscape with peaksand valleys where there is a tendency to go down the valley, down the track tothe station. The habit of habits is good, but some habits might be harmful.One thing that creates a really deep runnel is the repetition of a myth foreleven days in a row, once a year, for two thousand years. That makes the myth amore serious matter, a deeper rut. As an example of a really deep chreode,therefore, I recommend for your consideration the New Year’s festival of Akitu.Old Testament scholarship has produced a comparative study of New Year’sfestivals around the world that provides amazing evidence of morphic resonanceon a planetary scale. Based on this evidence, there was, before radio, a globalresonance with the Gaian mind on the same level as the distribution of theso-called Venus figurines of the Gravettian culture all over the planet.This is the link between chaos and the imagination. The repression of chaos, andthe resulting obstruction of imagination, has led to the development overthousands of years of the serious, perhaps fatal, ecological problems that wehave today. The growth of this problem beyond all bounds, with few people eventrying to do anything about it, suggests denial and a lack of imagination. Thisis an artifact of a cultural flaw that came along with the patriarchy.I’m not saying that patriarchal culture is bad because it’s patriarchal. I’msaying it’s bad because it has repressed chaos. Patriarchy has made chaos badand it has made Marduk boss: the god of law and order. We must reject this viewof chaos so that the planet and life and love can be saved. Now, lo and behold,an event has come along that is as positive, perhaps, as the discovery of thewheel was negative. Without giving up the wheel, or our automobiles, we areregaining chaos for potential partnership with the wheel. Chaos and order. Chaosand cosmos. Chaos and the imagination.Terence: Chaos and the imagination are paradoxically copresent in everyday life,in the dimension in which we find ourselves. I would like to expand on whatRalph has been saying from my own perspective. Chaos is feminine. Chaos isintuitional. Chaos has a very flirtatious relationship with language. Theprocess of creating a culture has to do with how we relate to the seduction ofchaos. Since we’re talking about everyday life, it seems reasonable to talkabout how we come to be in the kind of planetary mess that we’re in and whetherthese extremely rarefied and abstract matters that we’ve been talking about canin anyway be brought tangential to the issues of a burning planet.The first key is the power of chaos, which is feminine, beyond prediction, andbeyond full, rational apprehension. The second source of power is the DivineImagination, the imagination that is our richest legacy, the birthright thatconnects us to the divine. It’s our poetic capacity, our ability to resonatewith a notion of ideal beauty and to create that which transcends our ownunderstanding in the form of art.What does all this say about the situation we’re in and how we’ve gotten here? Ibelieve that the importance of psychedelics relates primarily to this situation,and not simply because they synergize cognition.We have a secret history. Knowledge has been lost to us and is only nowrecoverable in the light of the mind-set possible if we accept the new chaosparadigm. How this secret history relates to the Gaian mind and the world soulis a kind of new revelation. We must become aware of the astonishing fact thatas a species we are the victims of an instance of traumatic abuse in childhood.As human beings, we once had a symbiotic relationship with the world-girdlingintelligence of the planet that was mediated through shamanic plant use. Thisrelationship was disrupted and eventually lost by the progressive climaticdrying of the Eurasian and African land masses. This was the literal forcebehind our fall into history, our expulsion from Eden. All the primary myths ofthe Golden Age found and lost point to the fact that once we lived in dynamicbalance with nature—not as animals, but as human beings in a unique way that wehave lost. How have we lost it, and what have we lost?Psychoactive compounds that were brought into the expanding human diet duringthe early part of our evolution inhibited the formation of the ego, promotinginstead collectivist, tribal partnership values operating intuitively in areciprocal feedback relationship with the feminine vegetable matrix of thebiosphere. In other words, nothing was verbalized and everything was felt.Everything was intuited. Regularly, at the new and full moons, small groups ofhunter-gatherers and pastoralists took hallucinogenic plants and dissolved theirboundaries, engaging in group sex and annealing irregularities that had croppedup in their personal self-imaging since the last session. These practices keptcultural reality grounded on the plane of group and species values, which was indynamic balance with the ecosystem.When these practices were disrupted as supplies of these plants diminished, newreligious forms arose, and the time between these great festivals grew longerand longer. The ego began to take hold, first as a kind of cancerous aberration,then quickly becoming a new style of behavior that eliminated other styles ofbehavior by suppressing access to the sources of chaos.The point I want to make is that between the ego and the full understanding ofreality is a barrier: the fear of the ego to surrender to the fact of chaos. Ina premodern society, no woman could escape chaos because of the automatic birthscript that had women giving birth over and over and over until death. Women arebiologically scripted into being much closer to chaos simply because there arecertain episodes in the life of a female that are guaranteed to be boundarydissolving. The psychology of feminine sexuality, which involves the acceptanceof penetration, creates an entirely different relationship to boundary than doesthe male need to fulfill the potential to penetrate.We have lost touch with chaos because it is feared by the dominant archetype ofour world, the ego. The ego’s existence is defined in terms of control. Theendless modeling process that the ego carries out is an effort to fight theabsence of closure. The ego wants closure. It wants a complete explanation.The beginning of wisdom, I believe, is our ability to accept an inherentmessiness in our explanation of what’s going on. Nowhere is it written thathuman minds should be able to give a full accounting of creation in alldimensions and on all levels. Ludwig Wittgenstein had the idea that philosophyshould be what he called “true enough.” I think that’s a great idea. True enoughis as true as it can be gotten. The imagination is chaos. New forms are fetchedout of it. The creative act is to let down the net of human imagination into theocean of chaos on which we are suspended and then to attempt to bring out of itideas.My model for the psychedelic experience is the night sea journey—yourself as thelone fisherman on a tropical sea with your nets. Sometimes, something tearsthrough your nets and leaves them in shreds, so you just row for shore and putyour head under your bed and pray. Other times, what slips through the nets arethe minutiae, the minnows of this icthyological metaphor of idea chasing.Sometimes you actually bring home something that is food for the humancommunity, from which we can sustain ourselves and go forward.We haven’t talked much about art and aesthetics so far, but I think a uniquecharacteristic of the human world is its appetition for beauty. This is anotherplace where Platonism shines radiantly. Plato held that the Good was the Truthand that both were the Beautiful. This is a very quaint idea from the point ofview of modern philosophy, but I feel it in my bones when I actually connectmyself up to the planet.I believe chaos is capable of being a tremendous repository of ordered beauty.There is no disorder in the old definition of chaos. Chaos as disorder is a kindof hell notion, a kind of hypostatization of an ultimate state of disorder.Nowhere in the world that is deployed through space and time do we encounterthis. Instead, we encounter embedded order upon embedded, fractal order.Finally, for me, imagination is the goal of history. I see culture as an effortto literally realize our collective dreams. The process is now operating on avery crude level: You make your mask and I make my mask and then we dance aroundtogether. You design your shopping mall and I’ll design my World Trade Centerand we’ll put them on the same piece of real estate. Today, through media,psychopharmacology, virtual reality and human/machine integration, we’recreating a situation in which the imagination is something that we can share.The path of mind through its own meanderings will become something that can berecorded and played back. We will have the possibility of living in our ownpast, or of creating and trading realities as art. Art as life lived in theimagination is the great archetype that rears itself up at the end of history.The imagination is an auric field that surrounds the transcendental object atthe end of time. As we close distance with it, all of our cultural expressionand self-awareness takes on a curiously designed quality. The world is veryheavily designed in a way that it never was before. Morphogenetic fields ofgreat size and scope, in the form of international schools of architecture anddesign, touch whole continents. Entire cities are given certain ambiences. Thisis the summoning of imagination into the human scale. It’s like a god that wecall down and draw to Earth. William Blake called it the Divine Imagination.It’s the four-gated city, the flying saucer. We are on a journey to meet thegreat attractor, and as we close the distance it is more and more a multifacetedmirror of our own images of beauty. This journey is an ascending learning curvethat is becoming asymptotic; at that point, we are face to face with a livingmystery that is within each and all of us.The imagination argues for a divine spark in human beings. It is absolutelyconfounding if you try to see imagination as a necessary quantity in biology. Itis an emanation from above—literally a descent of the world soul into all of us.We are the atoms of the world soul. We open our channel to it by closing oureyes and obliterating our immediate, personalized, space-time locus. We thenfall into the imagination, which runs like an endless river through all of usand is driven by the hydraulic momentum of the cataracts of chaos.Riverine metaphors are endlessly applicable. They represent the flowing offorces over landscapes, the pressure of chaos on the imagination to createcreativity. These things are icons for the world that wants to be. The key issurrender and dissolution of boundaries, dissolution of the ego, and trust inthe love of the Goddess that transcends rational understanding. There will comea moment that will be an absolute leap into faith, and we will simply have tobelieve that something is waiting there because the dominator style of the egohas left us no choice.Ralph: “Cataracts of chaos”—these words roll off his tongue, which obviously hasa direct connection to the cataracts of chaos themselves! There are so manydifferent ideas to respond to here. I’ll try to limit myself to one or two.I’d like to connect two statements with a key from the Eleusinian mysteries.This conversation has stimulated speculation on what happened to the cataractsof chaos in the hands of the patriarchy.Historians generally suppose that there’s a straight line of influence fromBabylon to Ugarit to Minoan Crete to Mycenae to Athens, a cultural diffusionthat includes the festivals, which, as I said, are very similar. However, in theBabylonian festival, by 2000 B.C., there was already extensive domination by thepatriarchal male god of order. In Minoan Crete, on the other hand, according tothe excavators and all who have examined the artworks that remain, there was anoutstanding, longlasting florescence of partnership culture with no dominationby a male god. This presents a little question mark about the diffusion ofculture from Babylon to Crete.There is a complementary theory that postulates there was a renewal ofpartnership culture in Crete that came from India in the early days of Cretanculture, around 3000 B.C. In any case, it is agreed that there was diffusionfrom Crete to Greece and that the last remainder of Cretan culture, the lastvestige of the Garden of Eden we’re talking about, was a tremendous happinessand florescence of beauty in all aspects of life.The Eleusinian mysteries were said to be identical to those that in Crete werecelebrated publicly. They only became secret after the patriarchal takeover byMycenaeans in Crete and the exportation of this dual culture to Greece. Thereoccurred a bifurcation into the Overworld and the Underworld, the conscious andthe unconscious. The culture of the Goddess, and the partnership of gods andgoddesses in Crete, continued to exist in Greece, but as secret festivals knownas the mysteries.Among the common aspects of the festivals in Crete and Eleusis were the sexualand psychedelic rites celebrated in rigidly specified ritual formats on anannual basis. In patriarchy, because of its patrilineal aspect, one has to knowthe father of the children, not just the mother. Therefore, monogamy is veryimportant to patriarchy, and this was in strong conflict with the Cretanrituals. Sooner or later, the sexual rituals had to go.This is a simple explanation, not confirmed by scholarship, for the repressionof these rites. The Eleusinian mysteries disappeared, and what we are left withis the paradigm of Marduk the control freak, law and order, the repression ofchaos, and the constipation of the imagination and fantasy.Somehow, sexual license, the psychedelic ritual, and chaos go together. The NewYear’s festival continues to our day, but the sexual/psychedelic/chaotic aspectsof it were long ago removed and replaced with a recital of the conquest of chaosby the god of order.Terence: Do you think it’s because the ego is basically on a control trip andmust become the center of the space in which it operates? Egomaniacs controlwomen and resources. They believe vigilance is the key, as in the national mottoof Albania, “Fear it is that guards the vineyard.”Our culture definitely takes an egocentric dominator view. The fear of thepsychedelic experience is quite literally the fear of losing control. Dominatortypes today don’t understand that it’s not important to maintain control if youare not in control in the first place.In a tribal society, for instance, where there is no property and there are noassigned sleeping places, everyone behaves according to something that we canonly call whim. Whim has been replaced by “mine, yours, my spot, your spot, myfood, your food,” which has led to the dissolution of the psychedeliccollectivity. The world has become very threatening and everything is up forgrabs. Now we have to rely on the interpretation of group values instead of onfelt intuition. The ego is paranoia institutionalized.Ralph: I guess it’s a package deal. We have the dominator, the patriarchy, andthe ego, which in our culture we can see as a male disease like testosteronepoisoning.Terence: I don’t see it as a male disease. I think everybody in this room has afar stronger ego than they need. The great thing that Riane Eisler, in her bookThe Chalice and the Blade, did for this discussion was to de-genderize theterminology. Instead of talking about patriarchy and all this, what we should betalking about is dominator versus partnership society.Ralph: I agree with you; it’s a good service she has done. However, the problemwe’re faced with is how to get back to the partnership paradigm.One practical suggestion is your missionary appeal for psychedelic usage. Theego aspect of the problem arose not only through the suppression of psychedelicusage in ritual but through the gradually increasing interval between festivals.This process was similar to the cooling of the universe, out of which differentmaterial forms crystallized. The dominator society sort of crystallized outthrough the gradual increase in the interval between partnership rituals.Terence: That is part of it, definitely. The phonetic alphabet plays a role offurther abstracting from process, giving permission for all kinds of curiousdis-ensouling maneuvers on the part of the dominator/ego.Ralph: Well, we still have mathematics and music.Terence: Yes, but so few people have them. And those few who do are the creativeengines of their societies. They keep the connection to the muse.Ralph: Do you think that the Eleusinian mysteries could be reinstituted? Or hasthis possibility been irrevocably lost to “progress”?Terence: The psychedelic revival is an effort to find our way back to somethinglike the mysteries. We are not the first nor the most eminent to suggest thiskind of reengineering of the human animal. I call attention to the words ofArthur Koestler, the great anticommunist freedom fighter and scientificintellectual. In a book called The Ghost in the Machine, he concluded that therehas to be mass pharmacological intervention to change human behavior. Heenvisioned a drug that inhibits territoriality. Our reflexes and our mental setare highly and well adapted to the stoning to death of woolly mastodons, but,since we so rarely do that, we need to retool for living in peace while managinglimited resources. The dissolving of boundaries by psychedelics certainly makesthem candidates for antiterritoriality drugs.Ralph: Do you think that some of our existing national holidays could bechanged, or that a mythological mutation could be introduced that would go inthis direction? For example, in Switzerland, they recently invented Fastnacht.They previously had no rituals at all, barely Christmas, and there was asuffering of enormous boredom among people there. It was said that there was noknown way to make a new friend in Switzerland. So, just a few years ago, theyinstituted Fastnacht, in February. It is three days and nights of alcoholicrevelry around the fantastic reenactment of a medieval drama. It involves peoplemarching in the streets in parades led by musicians who have practiced amedieval song on medieval instruments all year long just for this three-dayceremony. Now it is said that, during Fastnacht, you can make a new friend.Terence: Something along that line that I’ve advocated—sometimes facetiously,sometimes seriously—is calendrical reform, and I have just the calendar allworked out. I won’t lay it all out here, but the basic notion is that it’s alunar calendar of thirteen lunar cycles. It has three hundred and eighty-fourdays, and consequently it precesses nineteen days against the solar year. Thiswould have the effect of taking the great yearly events of the calendar andslowly moving them through the seasons. For instance, if we kept Christmas onDecember 25, and you as child celebrated Christmas in winter, then as a teenageryou would celebrate it in spring, and as a young adult you would celebrate it inhigh summer. As an older person, it would occur in autumn, and then, when youwere truly old, Christmas would return again to the winter.The notion is to overcome the really bad dominator idea that the calendar shouldbe anchored rigidly at the equinoctial and solstitial points so that theheliacal rising of the equinoctial sun is always in the same place. Our currentcalendar sends the message that there is stability. The calendar is the largestframework there is; in it, all other contexts are somehow subsets. The solarcalendar is an effort to deny humanity’s mortality by reinforcing a false notionof permanence. What we actually want is a calendar that says to us, “All isflow; all is flux; all relationships are in motion to everything else.” This isa truer picture of the world. This may seem trivial, and exemplary of why weeggheads are harmless. But, think about it.If we yield the structure of the calendar to the dominator culture, letting ittell us what kind of calendar we shall have, then we shall all live within thecontext of the dominator framework. Changing the calendar would have tremendousconsequences, and it would not be opposed by the dominant culture until it wastoo late. It would be regarded as some kind of a crank thing, because itwouldn’t be realized that we were twiddling with the dials of our wholecivilization’s image of time and change.The year 2000 provides a built-in opportunity to switch the train to a new trackbecause at these millennial moments there’s a certain uncertainty in the massmind about how to proceed. If you just jump up onto the stage and say, “This isit, folks!” you might be able to pull it off.Rupert: The first thing that occurs to me is that your idea of a lunar calendarin which the months and festivals move around the year is already in place. It’sthe calendar of the Islamic world. For example, Ramadan, the fasting month,retrogresses around the year, so people experience it both in winter and insummer in the course of their lives. This is not exactly a confirmation of yourtheory about such a calendar breaking the dominator mode.Terence: Your point is certainly, um … unwelcome.Rupert: I’m still baffled by chaos. Its meaning keeps shifting. We started offwith chaos not having a negative connotation and just meaning the yawning void.In fact, as Ralph explained, it was the sky. Then it was the great womb, thesource of all things. It then got turned into Tiamat, who was slain by Marduk.In the first chapter of Genesis, it’s the “deep.” The “spirit moving on the faceof the waters” sounds to me like a wave theory of creation, as wind on watersets up waves. One thing that’s clear is that chaos is feminine, and creationout of chaos is like creation out of the womb, an all-containing potentialityemerging out of darkness.One of the metaphors that Terence used of the imagination was the dipping ofnets into the deep ocean and the pulling up of coelacanths of the imagination.This corresponds to the kind of imagery used by the Jungians for the unconsciousbubbling up from below, and it also fits with the idea of creativity welling upfrom the darkness of the Earth. Again, this is a model used in Genesis. Thebiblical account of Creation doesn’t have God creating animals and plants. Ithas God saying, “Let the Earth bring forth fresh growth; let there be on theEarth plants bearing seeds, fruit trees bearing fruit, each with seed accordingto its kind” (Genesis 1:11), and then, “Let the Earth bring forth livingcreatures according to their kind” (Genesis 1:24). The Earth brings them forthfrom herself.Terence also used the metaphor of the imagination descending from above, whichis a traditional Platonic or Neoplatonic image. In this model, creativity comesdown from above, becoming more and more manifest through a series of stages.These metaphors have given us both a top-down and a bottom-up model ofcreativity. Most theories of creativity I come across oscillate unstably betweenthose two models. I usually try to resolve the conflict by saying it must be amixture of both.In the realm of theology, these two models are known as ascending and descendingChristology. In the first three gospels, the model is Jesus Christ, who was bornas a child, initiated by John the Baptist, and received a new spiritualillumination at his baptism. He underwent a development and spiritualtransformation and became God. A man becoming God is an ascending or bottom-updevelopmental process. Then, in the Gospel of John, there is the Platonic modelof the Word becoming flesh, God becoming man, the top-down model of creativity.These models have always co-existed in Christian theology in a dialecticaltension.In most discussions of creativity, one gets into the same polarity. Chaos isseen by Ralph on the one hand as a chaotic, indeterminate process that, in somesense, liberates us from older models of control and mechanistic determinism. Onthe other hand, he also adopts the top-down model because he wants thegeneration of chaos to come from simple mathematical principles. There is alsothe attempt to tame chaos by modeling using the top-down method. Mathematicalmodeling of chaos, if not exactly in the dominator mode, is still, I think,within the Saint George and the Dragon archetype. Actually, Saint George didn’tslay the dragon. He pierced the dragon, tamed it, and led it captive into thecity. The dragon in that myth is obviously another form of the primal monster ofchaos.Are these metaphors just alternative models between which one can switch, likechanging tracks? Are they aspects of the same process, or are they complementaryprocesses?Terence: I think they’re different pictures of the same process. Much as theimage of the Star of David can be seen as the interpenetration of two triangles,this process is the notion of “as above, so below.” We don’t understand itunless we’re somehow able to hold both images simultaneously. It’s a cardinalpremise, I think, that in talking about these kinds of things you can’t forceclosure. This is alchemical thinking, in that the things that are beingdescribed are multidimensional objects that can sustain seemingly contradictorydescriptions. These are compound, complex concepts that must have this overlayto be correctly communicated or appreciated.Ralph: As above, so below. In the history of the chaos concept, as I describedit, there is a syncretism of the Hesiodic Chaos concept as the Milky Way, ayawning, celestial void, with the Babylonian Tiamat concept of chaos as a dragonor sea serpent. There are numerous pictures in Babylonian art of this seaserpent with a bridle and Marduk standing on its back holding the reins, drivingit along. Marduk has conquered the sea serpent. For some reason, mythology atthis point in history required that a celestial figure be overlaid on an Earthfigure. There are many gods and goddesses in the pantheon, and frequently theyare different aspects of the same thing. Rupert took me into a church in SantaCruz and showed me a shrine to Our Lady, the Virgin of Guadalupe, with apainting of her as a black goddess, a chthonic Earth Mother figure. She’swearing a dress with stars printed all over it.In the Easter basket model, the sky as a visible hemisphere comes to an end onthe horizon where the Earth begins. The connection between the sky and the Earthis actually the Milky Way, the handle of the basket. This is the royal road ofthe gods down which Orpheus goes to the Underworld to look for Eurydice. Thepoint where the sky meets the Earth, where the handle of the basket connects tothe woven part, is where the mathematical model meets the unconscious of theGaian mind. This is where the mathematical version of chaos meets the chaos ofeveryday life, and where the erotic and synergistic relationship between theEarth and sky versions of chaos is going to take place.Terence: Eleusis was a great turning point and a cultural episode not frequentlyenough discussed. After thousands and thousands of years, theGoddess-worshiping, orgiastic, psychedelic religion finally was confined to afew shrines in Greece and Crete. Then, ultimately, it was confined to a fewshrines only in Greece. It lingered there until Alaric the Visigoth finally didit under.This boundary-dissolving relationship to the vegetable, Gaian mind left ourtradition only about seventeen hundred years ago. In that seventeen hundredyears, in the absence of a dialogue with the Gaian expression of chaos,successively more deadly cultural forms, beginning with the phonetic alphabetand moving on to movable type and all the rest, evolved. Each one of thesetechnologies has had a tremendous negative impact on our self-image and hasentangled us deeper and deeper in a kind of Faustian pact with the physicalworld. It’s that blindness that has led us to the present situation. In theabsence of any boundary-dissolving ecstasies, we are left with the machinationsof the ego, which has led very quickly into a cultural cul-de-sac from whichthere may or may not be an escape.In studying that wrong turning, what was betrayed, what came out on top, andwhat was suppressed, we can perhaps run the film backwards and in some senserestore the previous situation. This involves opening our lives to chaos andbecoming much more a part of the will of the world soul. It means recapturingthe Greek sense of fate that has been replaced in our minds by the Faustianillusion of control and dominance.Ralph: The good news is that this opening to chaos is actually underway. Thechaos revolution now taking place throughout the sciences is a major setback forthe forces of law and order, control and dominance. Scientists, the high priestsof Marduk, must now accept chaos and replace Tiamat on her rightful throne. Thisis why I say that chaos is the biggest thing since the wheel. Imagination,creativity, and inspiration are all on the upswing.

Therefore, these experiences could be carried bythe mushroom.—Rupert Sheldrake"},{"pageContent":"FOURimage [images/line.jpg]The World Soul and the MushroomRupert: Terence, do you believe that creation comes out of randomness?Terence: It seems as though randomness is the least likely thing. Theprobabilistic view assumes that nature has randomness built into it becauserandomness is something that probability mechanics is competent to makestatements about. Yet nowhere in nature do we encounter this randomness. Theaveraging of many data samples suppresses the characteristics of unusual eventsby giving smooth curves that we assume describe processes we’ve never actuallyexamined with sufficient care. When we look carefully, as we are beginning to,we find fractal structures that are self-similar and surprisingly unpredictable.My notion of a novelty wave is offered in this new spirit. It would replace theidea of time as a smooth surface—as in the pure duration of the Newtonians—withthe idea of time being composed of discrete elements complexed together in aunique way under the aegis of definable rules. This can be visualized as afractal wave pattern overlaying the universe of space/time. The pattern impartsto time the local quality of either conserving accumulated material from thepast or expressing novel connections with emergent properties previously onlyimplicated.Rupert: If there’s no randomness in the universe, then what do we mean by chaos?Ralph: Well, ironically, in the chaos revolution, in the technical jargon ofmathematics, we’re talking about mathematical models that are chaotic in thatthey share the intuitive meaning of chaos, yet they are not random. Originally,when these models were discovered, they were called strange attractors. Then wesaw that they were ever-present in nature, so we decided they shouldn’t becalled strange. Someone suggested they ought to be called chaotic attractors.There was objection on the grounds that these models were the opposite of whatchaos ordinarily means, because they have order. I understand Rupert’s questionto refer to random behavior that is outside the realm of these mathematicalmodels, which are chaotic, yet not random. The question is whether anything innature lies outside the “ordered” realm of the chaotic attractors.image [images/f0060-01.jpg]Figure 5. The Time Wave. A theoretical construct developed by Terence McKennathat attempts to plot the ebb and flow of novelty through time. Noveltyincreases as the wave meanders toward zero. A period of nearly 4,300 yearsappears in the bottom portion. The upper portion shows a blowup of nearly fivehundred years’ duration. As the values approach zero, novelty and density ofconnectedness increase while entropy decreases.Rupert: Yes.Ralph: In my view, there is a lot left beyond our ken. We don’t know if, in thefuture, models for this “lot left beyond” will emerge or not. Given sufficienttime to continue our present evolutionary path with science, mathematics,computers, and so on, I should think that the amount of so-called “random”behavior—in the sense of our ignorance of any structure in it—would be in sharpdecline. Nevertheless, in the world of these mathematical models for chaos,there is space for novelty, mutation, and the discovery of totally new patterns.I don’t think that we need randomness in order to have the evolution of newforms.Rupert: What we do need is a universe sufficiently open and undetermined for newforms to have space to arise in. If all of nature is already geared up to followpredetermined waves, patterns, forms, and so on, whether they’re modeled inTerence’s computer or somebody else’s, then there’s not much space left forsomething truly new to emerge. My view is that the complexity of Terence’snovelty wave, as a concept of the quality of time, might develop as the universedevelops, not according to some simple algorithm but in a way that’s trulyunforeseeable.Terence: This would arise out of its resonance with its own past. It’s in therealm of resonances that this very difficult-to-quantify complexificationaccumulates.Rupert: My problem is that I think spontaneity and creativity come first. Allthese attempts to construct models of what’s going on will be inadequate toencompass the phenomena.Terence: All models are provisional, and that’s what preserves the openendednessof what they are modeling. The great intellectual and emotional changeaccompanying the paradigm shift will be in people’s ability to accept not havingfull explanations; they will understand that the depth of the mystery exceedsexplanations. Models are always provisional, always made of string and sealingwax. There is a part of reality that has been referred to as the value-darkdimension, about which nothing can be absolutely known. Chaos is in theresomewhere. The task of human becoming, and of mathematics and our intellectualtools, is to cast light into this dimension. This gives us a sense of discoveryand meaning, but it can never reduce the dimension to absolutes. Eventually,there is a domain in the value-dark dimension that is value-dark in principle.The physical analogy that we have for this is a black hole, from which noinformation escapes. We have to build into our theories these kinds of trapdoors and escapes so that we don’t get caught inside another illusion.Rupert: The attempt to tame chaos by having mathematical models is a modernversion on a rather abstract plane of the old myth of the solar hero conqueringthe sea monster, the dragon of the deep, the serpent of chaos. In the Christianversion, Saint Michael or Saint George is the shining hero piercing the darknessof the dragon. Ralph said that we can model some of these chaotic processes butthat there might be a small, medium, or large residuum. Let’s assume it’s large.Then we build more models to model some of the residuum. From there, it would beeasy to slide into the familiar statement, “Well, in principle, it should bepossible to model it all.” This is the modern version of the idea that somehow,in principle, the whole of reality can be engulfed, within some kind ofmathematical model. In other words, the world soul is in some sense subject tothe supreme mathematical mind, which is superior to, transcendent of, and priorto the whole natural world. This slides over into a kind of metaphysics that’svery traditional among mathematicians.Ralph: We’ve got to have a talk about this, Rupert. You persist in thinking thatmathematics hasn’t advanced since the time of Plato. Your objection to modelsfor chaos is based on an inappropriate view of Platonic ideals. The new modelsfor chaos are coming into existence by a process of evolution and discovery. Idon’t think that Plato, or anyone before the invention of the computer, couldeven have imagined them. This discovery process is part of the evolutionary,creative aspect of the world soul, which we can think of now in two layers. Onelayer is the world of matter and energy in which there is the discovery of newfields in evolution. The other layer is the mental world, which includes verbaldescriptions and mathematical models.Apparently, these two levels are in a process of coevolution. If, as in figure 3[chapter2.html#fig3], there is a Gaian unconscious supplying new forms out ofchaos as raw material for evolution, then either it is supplying both levels,the mental and the physical, or else the mental and the physical are twoseparate levels to the Gaian unconscious. Probably, there’s a connection fromthe Gaian unconscious to each of the two coevolving levels; this three-wayconnection could be modeled as a triangle. The idea that whatever comes intoconsciousness has a mathematical model doesn’t conflict with creation, becausewe can’t assume that all mathematical models already exist. There’s the sameinfinite possibility of discovery, invention, and novelty in this mental planeas in the material. Why not? What’s the difference?Rupert, you seem to think that one or the other of these has to have precedenceover the other—that either the mathematical model is abstracted from materialobservation or the material world is concretizing or condensing aroundmathematical models. This is unnecessary. It may be just a process ofcoevolution. Sometimes the left foot leads and sometimes the right.Rupert: Fine. That’s a wonderful explanation. However, whereas you’re amathematician yet not a Platonist, Terence is much more Platonic. He thinks thenovelty wave is coming from some kind of higher realm and somehow underlies thebehind-the-scenes mechanics of the cosmos.Terence: I’m not sure whether this novelty wave is simply a mathematicaldescription of an enzymatically mediated process on the surface of the Earth or,as you indicated, whether it can be raised to the level of a higher principle.It is determined, but only in a fairly weak way that sets the schedule of eventswithout announcing what the events will be. I’m troubled by my Platonism. Irealize that certain naive assumptions haunt it. I don’t want these forms to beeternal. I want them to somehow arise internally out of the ongoing process ofthe world. I haven’t quite figured out how to get these ducks all in a row.Ralph: Before the computer revolution, there might have been some question as tothe preexistence of all mathematical forms. But now, there’s no question.Mathematics is a world of its own, a landscape with hills and valleys, and muchof this terrain has not been explored. Some features have been identified byvarious travelers who have come back and given their reports. There is a processof discovery of the already existing landscape as well as the modification andevolution of that landscape through the interaction of human consciousness.Although it’s one, two, three here, and one, two, three everywhere, we couldstill land on a foreign planet and find that they had explored, excavated, andmodified a region of the mathematical landscape never visited by us.Terence: So little of mathematics has to do with numbers. It’s basically payingattention to the rules operating among defined sets of objects. I think thatonce you figure out what mathematics is, every single one of us could invent anew branch of it.Ralph: I don’t believe that mathematics is the result of creative activity onthe part of people, that it’s been invented. It hangs together with an integritythat is beyond the capabilities of the short history of human consciousness.Terence: Does it hang together? Or is it an archipelago of islands? Do thepeople who are doing advanced number theory have anything whatsoever to say tothe super algebraists who don’t have anything to say to the fractal people?Ralph: I think it’s a single landscape, all tied together in complete integrity.Terence: A wild-eyed claim!Ralph: It doesn’t matter too much. The varied mathematical theories are justimpressions of travelers having returned from a distant land. I think it’s timefor us to face the soul of the world. We know from reports in the Library ofCongress that other people have seen in their travels a different part of theworld soul. Mathematics here, sensory experience there, Babylonian history here,chaos of the unconscious providing novelty there, and so on. How do we put itall together? What is the relationship between the existence of the world souland the human imagination? The mathematical landscape was extensively traveled,mapped, experienced, and used in the biological world long before the humanspecies evolved. What is the role of mathematics in the coevolution of the worldsoul and human consciousness?Rupert: One can deduce several things about the soul of the world. One is thatit contains qualities as well as quantities. The world we actually experience isfull of colors, sounds, smells, and other qualities known to us through oursenses. The procedure of science since the seventeenth century has been toignore sensory qualities and to consider only what were called the primaryqualities of substances, namely, their weight, position, momentum, and so on.These could be assigned numbers and treated mathematically. Reality was treatedas colorless, tasteless, soundless, and odorless. It was abstract, objective,and mathematical. Qualities known through our senses had no objective existenceoutside of the mind of the subjective observer.It seems to me that the imagination of the world soul is going to work, not justin terms of numbers and mathematics, but also in terms of qualities. It’s likelyto contain all possible tastes, smells, colors, and other qualities that existin the world, as well as the experience and imagination of these qualities.Terence: Heaven.Rupert: No, it’s not heaven. It’s the soul of the world. The soul contains notonly everything that’s in the world but also the imagination that has given riseto everything in the world. And this imagination is continually active, givingrise to new forms and possibilities.Ralph: Does that mean the soul of the world is not evolving but is alreadycomplete?Rupert: To answer that, let me look first at a more conventional view of thesoul of the world. Theoretical physicists are currently trying to conceive of aunified field of everything. This was Einstein’s goal, but he couldn’t reach itbecause he tried to do it by mathematics alone. This problem is now seen in thecontext of the Big Bang cosmology.When the whole physical universe is cranked by calculation right back to thefirst few jiffies, the temperature rockets up to billions of degrees centigradeand everything changes. Things don’t behave the same way they behave in thepresent. They become more symmetrical. When the universe is cranked back evenfurther, it arrives at a state of primal unity, the primal field of nature.According to superstring theory, this field has nine dimensions of space and oneof time. As the universe develops and expands, symmetries break, and the fieldsof nature, such as the electromagnetic and the gravitational fields, precipitateout.All forms and patterns of things that develop in the world have their ownorganizing fields, and all are ultimately derived from the primal unified field,which remains the all-encompassing field of the world. The world field, since itcontains everything within it, necessarily has an evolutionary quality becauseit embraces everything that happens in the evolving cosmos. This is theconception toward which modern cosmological speculation is pointing.In my own view, the world field has a memory of everything that’s happenedwithin it already. The cosmic imagination involves ongoing memory in a worldwhose physical body is shaped by the habits of nature. Thinking of the worldsoul in terms of a world field still has a kind of black-and-white,mathematical, abstract quality to it. What I want to express is that anyreasonable conception of the world soul would have to recognize the existence ofcolors, tastes, smells, sounds, and other qualities.Terence: We use the word soul for the world soul because we sense an analogywith the soul of the individual. If you begin to carry forward that analogy, youget into some fairly astonishing places. We imagine the soul to be anonlocalizable, non-material essence that survives death, a higher dimensionalform erected through the process of life that when the body dies is releasedinto a higher dimension that is its source and home.Pursuing this analogy, is the world soul an invisible unseen, organismicstructure that has been erected through the evolution of life on this plane? Isthe destiny of the world soul incomplete until it severs itself from the matrixthat created it? Is the global crisis and inner searching and turmoil of ourtime the dawning realization that we are actually facing the death of the worldsoul, meaning its severance from the dimensions that allowed it to accrete andform?Ralph: I must say I’m feeling very uncomfortable with this discussion, and I’mastonished to find myself sitting here accusing you guys, of all people, ofthinking too small. I find the whole idea that the world’s soul is confined in aspace/time continuum of four or ten dimensions extremely claustrophobic, as wellas the idea that the world soul had no chance of existence until the Big Bangprovided matter and energy or something. I’m even doubtful about the Big Bang.But even assuming that it occurred, I think the whole idea of soul suggests theaspiration of eternity for consciousness and unconsciousness or for someultimate essence of the life experience. It could be that solar systems come andgo, that universes come and go, and that the world soul, as it were, incarnatesin one universe after another. After a Big Bang, there may follow a collapse,followed by another Big Bang. The idea of the world soul coming to an end onceand for all because of a nuclear winter or something is very confining.Terence: I’m not suggesting that it ceases to exist. I’m suggesting that it’sliberated into another dimension.Rupert: Ralph, yours is the Hindu model, and Terence’s is the Christian.Ralph: Perhaps. I’m talking about an existence of the world soul that is beyondspace and time. Space and time are illusions having to do with the severerestrictions of incarnation in these chimpanzee bodies.Rupert: This is pure Hinduism. It is a Hindu doctrine that the soul comes from arealm beyond space and time and is incarnated in a body. When its body dies, itis reincarnated in another one. The soul’s true destiny is not in the body. Itremains in touch with the source from which it has come, which is far greaterthan any of its embodied existences.One possible traditional model is that the universe will die, and then thecosmic soul will be reincarnated. I contrast it with Terence’s model, which isthe Christian eschatological model in which the universe reaches a culmination.The idea is that the whole of creation, the entire universe, is groaning intravail for a new order to be born. This is the idea of a new creation—not justof humanity, and not just of this Earth, but of the whole cosmos.Terence: Out of Bios.Rupert: Out of Bios comes a totally new order of existence. This correspondsroughly to your notion of the embodiment of the world soul coming to anend—presumably not just on this Earth, but in the entire cosmos. This is themost extreme version of Judeo-Christian eschatological thought.Terence: Devil, you say. This is most extreme. Out of devotion to my theory, Igive assent to it. However, my personal notion of the world soul is not asmetaphysical as either of yours. I’m not really into it as God Almighty. I’minto the world soul as the largest and smartest creature imaginable. It isn’tthe god who hung stars like lamps in heaven, and it isn’t the force that spinsthe galaxies on their axes. The world soul is something that has arisen out ofbiology. It’s an organism within the universe of space and time, but it didn’tmake the universe. It’s an inhabitant of it, but on a scale that makes us mereatoms within its form.Ralph: I think we’re all involved in a kind of compromise. What we need here isa Twelve-Step group or something. We have to reprogram ourselves out of ourchildhood conditioning as the Hindu, the Judeo-Christian, and the Scientist. Ourwork, thought, talk, and relationship are very much inspired by our individualtravels through the spirit, where we have seen and felt the largeness of theworld soul. When we discuss it or bring it down into language or relate it toordinary reality, there is a tendency toward conservatism, which ends up lookinglike anthropocentrism. We compress what we’ve experienced on a grand scale downto the human scale and relate it too much to human consciousness and humanhistory.Terence: When I look at human history, I see the accumulation of a sense ofurgency long before anyone started worrying about ecocide or population. It’salmost as though the world soul is the thing that wants to live and, sensinginstability, it is trying to build a lifeboat out of the clumsy material ofprotoplasm.Ralph: This is like fighting an infection. The Gaian mind may be faltering dueto a bad habit. Incarnation is addictive, and the reason there is an infectionout of control on this planet is because of this bad habit.Terence: The world soul may actually sense the finite life of the sun, and itmay be trying to build a lifeboat for itself to cross to another star. How inthe world can you cross to another star when the only material available isprotoplasm? Well, it may take fifty million years, but there are strategies.They have to do with genetic languages, and with developing a creature who dealswith matter through abstraction and analysis, eventually creating technology.This is all an enzymatically mediated process, a plan in the mind of the worldsoul to survive.image [images/f0070-01.jpg]Figure 6. Three perspectives on Stropharia cubensis, a psilocybin-containingmushroom. Kathleen Harrison McKenna © 1991.Ralph: In our experience of the divine logos, isn’t there the feeling that we’vealready gone beyond the physical plane of protoplasm? Is this not already a kindof star travel?Terence: Yes, but then why this increasing urgency, century after century? Forfifteen thousand years, there has been increasing anxiety and the following ofincreasingly irrational chreodes. Only if there is a problem with the stabilityof the environment do the last ten thousand years of human history make anysense. This problem has created history as an evacuation, a frantic project tofind a way out. That’s why things have been allowed to tear loose, to poison theoceans, to strip the continents. The world soul, I think, is in communicationwith us in the culminating moment of human history. Everything is being scriptedfor a purpose, and toward an end unglimpsed by us but tied up with the survivalof everything.If it were seriously important to attain star flight at all costs because thebiosphere is in trouble, a fruitful approach would be super miniaturization. Inother words, we would need to find a way to turn people into spores and thenseed these spores throughout the galaxy, relying on light pressure andgravitational convection to distribute them. At the rate of percolation ofmatter through the galaxy, spores released from a single planet could penetratethe entire galaxy in about forty-five million years, which on the scale of thelife of the universe is not long at all. I think what is called for is aretooling of the human form.Ralph: We’re going to send termites out into space?Terence: Mushrooms! Human mushrooms. We know that psilocybin is closely relatedto serotonin. Serotonin makes the brain functions of the mental universepossible for the mushroom.If you think about the mushroom, it is perfectly engineered for truly longduration survival and adaptation. Look how lightly it touches matter. Itsmycelium is simply a cobweb in the soil of any planet, and yet it synapses uponitself and is full of neurotransmitter-like psychedelic compounds. It’s like athinking brain, yet it condenses itself down into a thing three microns across,of which several million per minute can be shed by a single carpophore. Sporesare perfectly designed to travel in space. They can endure extremes oftemperature. Their color reflects ultraviolet radiation. The surfaces of sporesare composed of the most radiation impervious organic materials known.This is an example of how an abstract notion like the world soul can penetratethe upper levels of the world of biology and organisms.Rupert: Insofar as the mushroom and the human psyche have had a symbioticrelationship, the mushroom-induced experiences in human consciousness are in themorphic field of this symbiotic relationship. Therefore, these experiences couldbe carried by the mushroom. The mushroom spores would have to germinatesomewhere, giving rise to mushrooms on another planet. Then, when consciousorganisms ate the mushrooms, they would gain access telepathically to this wholerealm of the human psyche.Terence: It’s more than a symbiosis. Perhaps we are going to be downloaded, oruploaded. If we can find a way to download ourselves into the mushrooms, then,when the planet explodes, it’ll be a free tailwind to our tour bus, you see.Rupert: I think we may have already downloaded ourselves into the mushrooms."},{"pageContent":"image [images/common.jpg]Ralph: The world soul as mycelium: the pattern that connects …In fact, the whole Earth may be chemically regulated through very smallmolecules, aromatic compounds that are byproducts of the metabolism of variousspecies but that percolate out through the environment and set up the ambiencein which a lot of animal and plant business is done.—Terence McKennaJust as the electromagnetic field is an interface between the matter fields andthe mental, psychic, and morphic aspects of ourselves as human beings, so theelectromagnetic field could be playing a similar role in the mental structure ofthe soul of the world.—Rupert SheldrakeWe have in our individual consciousness a particular affinity with theelectromagnetic field: electromagnetic perception, reception, and so on, asepitomized by vision. The easiest thing to affect by the phenomena of mind overmatter should be the electromagnetic field.—Ralph Abraham"},{"pageContent":"FIVEimage [images/line.jpg]Light and VisionRupert: I’ve been thinking about the connection between physical light and thelight of consciousness, the light of reason, and the light of vision. It’s notenough to say that one kind of light is physical and the others aremetaphorical. In some sense they must be aspects of each other.The key may be in the connection between light and vision. How much do weunderstand about the nature of vision? Science doesn’t tell us much. It tells usthat light moves from the thing we see, goes through the eye, forms an invertedimage on the retina, and causes patterns of electrical and chemical activity totake place in the optic nerves and cerebral cortex. Then, somehow, what we’reseeing seems to spring up in a totally unexplained way as a subjective image.This image is somewhere inside the brain, yet it is subjectively experienced asoutside the body. If I’m looking at you, Terence, the light rays come into myeye, and then I have a subjective image of you that is, according to thestandard theory, an electrochemical pattern in my optical cortex. This seems tome an extremely peculiar theory of vision, because it locates the visual worldwe experience inside the brain and not around us where it seems to be.When I look at you, my image of you is interpreted by me; it’s a mentalconstruct. I think this mental construct may not be inside the brain but rightwhere you are, namely, outside me, where my image of you seems to be. Theconventional idea that the image is inside my brain does not correspond with myactual experience. It’s just a theory, but a theory of remarkable hallucinatorypower because we so easily forget it’s merely a theory.If in the process of vision there’s an outward projection of images as well asan inward movement of light, if I’m not just playing with words, then there mustbe something moving out as well as light moving in. If so, people or thingsmight be affected just by being looked at.The idea that something goes out from the eyes is a very old and traditionalview of vision. It was present among the pre-Socratics and is found in implicitform all over the world in the fear and practices associated with the “evileye.” These practices are indeed supposed to involve the outward movement ofinfluences from the eye to the thing or person being looked at. There’s also anenormous folklore in Western culture about the sense of being stared at, thefeeling people have when they think they’re being looked at, for example, frombehind.There’s not been much empirical research on the sense of being stared at: threepublished papers in a hundred years. It’s a subject that parapsychologists haveignored as well as psychologists. It could be, oddly enough, the biggest blindspot in our view of the world, because it could hold the key to an entirely newunderstanding of the relationship between mind and matter, or spirit and body.Let’s assume for the purpose of discussion that it can be establishedempirically that there is indeed such a thing as the sense of being stared at.Some influence passing out through the eyes can be detected empirically. Whatkind of influence could this possibly be? What kind of influence could be movingoutward through the eyes in the opposite direction to the incoming light?There are two possible ways of explaining such an influence. First, this outwardmovement could be in a kind of mental field that is somehow over and above theelectromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field sets off electrochemicalchanges in the brain, and somehow the mental field organizes and meshes in andrelates to it but is not itself part of it. The mental field then projectsoutward, placing an image where the person or object being viewed is actuallylocated. Such fields would extend all around us and be filled with our sensoryexperience of the world.In the second model, a more economical one, the outward projection process takesplace by a reverse movement through the light that is coming into the eyes. Inother words, when a photon of light comes in, it corresponds to an antiparticlemoving out, and these outward-moving influences move along the exact track ofthe photons. These particles are then associated with vision, perception,comprehension, and all subjective experience of an object. They’re the grokwave, if you like. Since, physically speaking, from the point of view of aphoton, no time elapses as it travels, the connection between the source and theplace where it arrives, between subject and object, is instantaneous. In thisway vision may be very closely related to light.It would be crude to say that the antiparticle of the photon is the vision—theparticle of sight—but this concept may be the missing link between vision andlight. It may simply be that the photon is in some sense reversible, and thatthe electromagnetic field is in some sense the field of vision as well.Terence: There are a number of questions to be asked here. If the vision weresimply the antiparticle of the photon, the phenomenon of light pressure shouldnot exist. Since this phenomenon does exist and is well studied, the vision mustbe more esoteric then an antiphoton.Rupert: This is no problem at all. The photon is a particle with physicalproperties in the physical realm and therefore exerts physical pressure. Thevision has to do with conscious experience, with properties of mind. It’s movingin the opposite direction, and the sensing of being stared at would be a sensingof those particles or waves impinging. There would be a kind of pressure in thatdirection of the psychic kind.Terence: A more elegant way to describe what you’re saying would be to call thisreverse wave phenomenon a quality of the photon itself. From the point of viewof the photon, the travel time to and from its destination is zero. Likewise,travel time from destination back to origin is zero. Why not simply take a pagefrom superstring theory and visualize the photon as a kind of particle that isstretched in one dimension? It is present at its origin and its destinationsimultaneously and thus able to impart information at a distance.Ralph: As hypotheses go, this is the big bag full. Certainly if it wereestablished that no effect could be produced in a person by looking at them frombehind, this discussion would be less interesting. There would still remain someserious outstanding questions about the morphogenetic fields proposed as thememory banks of the species in Rupert’s books.Rupert: There would be questions as well about the relation of mind and matterand the nature of vision and light.Ralph: Nevertheless, it doesn’t seem very useful to make the assumption thatsuch an effect has been established. If it were, it would be the first of allthe various so-called paranormal phenomena of recent decades to be validated andaccepted. That would mean a lot of paradigms would be shifted, and we would alsobe seeking explanations for telepathy, remote viewing, clairvoyance, and othereffects of vision at a distance.Rupert: Second sight.Terence: I don’t think it would automatically follow, if this effect wereconfirmed, that people would think it had anything to do with eyes or light atall. If we establish that attention can be felt across space, this would be anestablishment of telepathy. The felt sensation would not be due to the fact thatI’m looking at the back of someone’s head but that I’m focusing my attention,which would be most effective when I really bore in. The output of the opticalsystem does not increase; it’s the output of the mental act of concentrationthat does.Ralph: If we agree, then, that science would be stood on its head by thediscovery of one paranormal thing, which would make all paranormal occurrencesfair game, then we can assume that field theories would expand considerably.Mathematical models for the morphogenetic field would abound. Let’s say we didhave an experimental result in the laboratory demonstrating that a person canget someone else’s attention by staring at them, or by boring in, as Terencesays. Would it really be natural then to propose the electromagnetic field as anintermediary for that influence? Or would we rather propose another field as aconceptual model for the observed phenomenon?Since ancient times, we’ve thought of mental, physical, and spiritual phenomenaas operating in different planes. The planes used metaphorically by the ancientsof Greece and the rishis (seers) of India are more or less what we’re callingfields, and these thinkers found it useful to separate these fields.The electromagnetic field is physical—at least I think of it as physical. I likethe idea of a separate mental field. The mind somehow follows the eye andextends itself so as to actually engulf the object being viewed, to know itthrough intimate touch. Cognition is then a kind of engulfing, like eating. Thismotion is visualized in the mental plane and therefore belongs to a differentfield. I feel a bias toward this view.On the other hand, if you could show that this telepathic transmission from oneperson to another can be modulated electromagnetically by a magnet or filter,that would strengthen the argument for the actual proximity of the two separateplanes without, even then, identifying them.Rupert: There’s a part of me that thinks the separate field idea is moreattractive, but I’ve been leaning over backward to see whether we can come to anew understanding of the electromagnetic field in which the connection betweenvision and light is a very close one. Even if there is another field involved,it must be in intimate resonance with the electromagnetic field. There’s nodoubt that changes in the brain are largely changes in electromagnetic patterns,and there’s scope for resonance there, but the mental field may also resonatewith the light that’s coming into our eyes. If this mental field is resonatingwith the electromagnetic field of light, then indeed it will connect us throughthe light to the objects we are seeing. Anything that resonates with the lightthat’s in between us will directly connect us via the light.Ralph: I’m more comfortable with the wave rather than the particle metaphor.Let’s just think of waves. Here I am looking at waves on the ocean, and I seethat there’s a rock out there. As the waves pass the rock, their shape ischanged: there is a hologram of the rock within the wave that comes forward andcrashes on the beach. Then there’s a reflected wave that goes back. I think theelectromagnetic field, as physicists view it, is something very much like this.Its mathematical model is a wave equation. This seems to be a suitable mediumfor influence to go both ways. But somehow I don’t see it as having a richenough structure to model all mental processes.Rupert: I’m only modeling vision, so far.Ralph: The visual part of the mental field may be a very thin slice of themorphogenetic field that is in very close resonance with the electromagneticfield.Rupert: I think that if we take the idea of interfacing planes—the old idea ofdifferent levels—and think of the planes as fields, then we do actually have aseries of stratified levels.First there are the quantum matter fields, which have to do with the strong andweak nuclear forces in atoms and which determine the shape and structuralproperties of atoms and molecules. They only work at very short ranges.Then there is the electromagnetic field, which is an organizing field of morecomplex structures. The electromagnetic field actually holds together atoms,molecules, crystals, and everything else. One could say that the electromagneticfield is associated with the morphic fields of molecules and crystals.At the level of plants, there’s a morphogenetic field of vegetative growth thatsomehow interfaces with the electromagnetic field. In animals, over and abovethe morphogenetic fields are the fields of instincts and movements; theyorganize and coordinate the activities of the nervous system.There are hierarchically higher planes above these, such as perceptual fieldsand fields of higher level understanding. There may be planes of fields that arelike the levels you spoke of, Ralph, but in a nested hierarchy. Thegravitational field embraces all; it’s the universal field.Ralph: The electromagnetic field, a constituent component of the morphogeneticfield or the world soul, should be utilized economically to carry as much of theburden of explanation as possible. Certainly all of the morphogenetic phenomenaof crystals and so on are intimately connected by resonance with theelectromagnetic field.Terence: There are not only electromagnetic fields but chemical fields. I thinkthat pheromones are vastly underrated for their organizing power in biology andsocial systems. In fact, the whole Earth may be chemically regulated throughvery small molecules, aromatic compounds that are byproducts of the metabolismof various species but that percolate out through the environment and set up theambience in which a lot of animal and plant business is done. Easily volatilizedlow-molecular-weight compounds are probably behind a lot of the mechanisms forthe self-regulation of nature. If materialists can seriously argue that theprogressive ease through time of crystallizing new compounds has to do with seedcrystals moving around from laboratory to laboratory on chemists’ beards, thenthey will certainly be in agreement that the percolation rates of nature areeffective enough to move these control and message-bearing chemicals aroundeverywhere.Ralph: This idea is very supportive of Rupert’s economy move, because theolfactory bulb is nothing but a transducer of information from the chemicalfield to the electromagnetic field. Just a small number of molecules of apheromone are enough to excite an identifiable electromagnetic wave across thebulb, which is then identified by some kind of associative memory livingprimarily in the electromagnetic activity of the brain. This coupling shows thatthe electromagnetic field is an intermediary between the chemical field and themental field.Terence: The chemical field is simply a higher-order manifestation of theelectromagnetic field, because most of these volatile compounds have veryelectronically active ring structures.Rupert: It’s a resonance phenomenon.Terence: It is charge transfer and resonance, and doubtless bioelectronicactivity of other types. The most electronically active molecules are the drugs,the pheromones, the growth regulators, and so forth.Rupert: These principles could also apply to hearing. When I see you, you arelocalized somewhere outside me, where you are. If I hear you, your sounds arealso localized outside me. I don’t hear sounds as if they’re arising inside myauditory cortex. I hear them as if they’re rising around me in three-dimensionalspace, and I can locate which direction they’re coming from.This means we are not only surrounded by a visual perceptual field that spreadsout from us and fills the space of our perception, but we are also surrounded byan auditory perceptual field. We are surrounded by an ocean of fields.Ralph: The ocean has infinite structure and complexity but nevertheless couldnever function as a brain. The brain is, in the neurophysiology it presents tothe experimentalist, certainly much simpler than the mind. The brain cannotfunction through the electromagnetic field alone, even though all of its effectsand patterns are manifest in the electromagnetic field. Its structure is muchricher than the electromagnetic field, which can’t control all these patternswithout the brain’s complex structure of cortices, intercortical cells, chemicalmessengers, and ion channels.Modeling the brain requires much more mathematical structure than does modelingthe electromagnetic field. The brain is much closer to the physical universethan to the mental universe, so I think the electromagnetic field is too thin tooccupy more than a fraction of the entire structure of the field that carriesrecognition, memory, the ability to serve in tennis and learn a new language andrecognize haiku, and so on.Rupert: I think that somehow the brain plays an interface role between thechemical and morphic and mental realms. The question that arises is, How doesthe electromagnetic field interface with the quantum mechanical fields that holdtogether the structures of atomic nuclei and electrons in their orbits? Thesestructures are actually maintained by fields that in a sense are stronger thanthe electromagnetic field, for they resist it in such a way that the positivelycharged protons bound together in the nucleus do not fly apart through mutualrepulsion, and the negatively charged electrons do not plunge into the nucleus.The electromagnetic field works around these matter fields as a more subtlefield.Ralph: Perhaps the quantum mechanical field, not the electromagnetic field, isthe intermediary between the physical and mental planes.Terence: But, Ralph, if you feel that the electromagnetic is inadequate to whatRupert is asking of it, then you must be equally skeptical of the morphogeneticfield.Ralph: No, I’m not skeptical. I think that what we’re trying to do, through therevision of our actual life experience, is make up a model for some of theparanormal phenomena we’ve experienced that scientists prefer to totally ignore.The electromagnetic field and the history of its modeling, its hermeneutics, isan excellent case to imitate. What we are trying to do is fashion a fieldconcept around these phenomena. It does seem very attractive to think of theelectromagnetic field as some kind of favored intermediary among all thephysical fields.Perhaps the mental field will end up with a mathematical model that is fieldtheoretic, multidimensional, and coupled only to the electromagnetic field,which is coupled to all the other physical fields.This is a combination model, a sandwich model, that might be successful inexplaining perception, cognition, and the idiosyncrasies of time. There mighteventually be a general relativity theory for the mental field that wouldexplain clairvoyance and so on. What we’re talking about now is the struggle toenvision the coupling between the mental field and the electromagnetic field,including wave metaphors, particle metaphors, and so on.Rupert: That’s right. My preferred model has always been one in which perceptionand mental activity have a kind of fieldlike structure; it would. be a morphicfield of some kind.Ralph: We also ought to think about the possibility that these effects, like thesense of being stared at, will not be confirmed in laboratories. This is alreadythe experience of many experimental efforts over the years to confirm theso-called paranormal. Where there is evidence, it always seems to be just theslightest bulge of the curve to the right or left of absolute insignificance.These paranormal phenomena, which we want to capture in a model, don’t seem tobe very robust. They come and go, perhaps due to the fact that they belong tothe mental field and are very subject to noise in that field. For whateverreason, they are very difficult to confirm, and I’m thinking of that as being akind of evidence in itself. On the one hand, there is the very widespreadimpression that these things exist, and on the other hand, there is theimpossibility of confirming them in the experimental paradigm of modern science.Somehow this suggests to me the necessity for a thick model, a richer field inwhich to try to do the modeling, where there are chaotic attractors everywhereand no homeostasis or anything like that.Rupert: The reason I wanted to discuss this in the first place is that Iactually don’t know what to think. Taking light and vision to be two aspects ofthe same phenomenon leads us into a whole other area: the seemingly metaphoricalmeaning of light in the context of the “light of consciousness.” For example,when we dream, we see things in a kind of light. This light illuminatespsychedelic visions, dreams, daydreams, and all visual imagery that occurs withour eyes closed. There’s some sense in which our imagination, our image-makingfaculty, is self-luminous.In the case of vision in normal physical light, the light comes first and visioncomes second. If you shut the light off, you can’t see. But in the visionarysense, vision itself may generate light, at least subjectively. Visions areself-luminous. If someone has visions enough, according to religious traditions,they start developing halos and their bodies become luminous.The point I’m trying to make is that if physical light has conscious visionassociated with it, then the reverse may also be true: conscious imagery mayhave light associated with it.Terence: Tryptamine hallucinogens certainly fill the head with light. Serotonin,their near relative in brain chemistry, is transuded to melatonin by alight-mediated reaction. In other words, light actually enters through the eyesand follows a part of the visual pathway that branches off and goes to thepineal gland, where photons work a chemical change on serotonin and turn it intomelatonin. These compounds are near relatives of the tryptamines, which are thepsychoactive compounds occurring in psychedelic mushrooms. All this is going onin the pineal, and it’s all light-driven chemistry.Ralph: Nevertheless, it seems that this kind of vision has nothing to do withthe electromagnetic field. Even though these neurotransmitters are veryphotosensitive, the fact is that in the dark people have very bright visions.Neurochemical activity in the visual cortex or somewhere else mimics the effectof photons falling on the retina. In the alternation back and forth betweenelectromagnetic and chemical waves on neurophysiological levels, thepsychedelics take over at some point and supply what appears to be the result ofa previous train of several reversals. In the illumination on that level, thephotons are replaced by this other messenger.It might be useful to think about the habits of electromagnetic nature and thebehavior of the electromagnetic field as evolving according to the habits of themorphogenetic field. This would explain the resonance between them: as above, sobelow. The m-field creates the em-field to do its bidding.Rupert: Just as the electromagnetic field is an interface between the matterfields and the mental, psychic, and morphic aspects of ourselves as humanbeings, so the electromagnetic field could be playing a similar role in themental structure of the soul of the world. If there is a world soul thatpermeates the entire cosmos, its bodily level may be expressed primarily throughthe gravitational field while its mental level may be expressed through somekind of interface with the electromagnetic field. This would be a perfect mediumfor the world soul’s omniscience and for divine omniscience through the worldsoul. Everything that happens affects the electromagnetic field; its holographicreality at any moment is in exact correspondence with what’s happening. Theuniversal electromagnetic field is the interface of the world soul with thephysical planes of reality.Ralph: I like the idea of the electromagnetic field being an ideal intermediarypositioned in a hierarchy of fields, much like the position of our individualconsciousness in the hierarchy of consciousness of the world soul. We have inour individual consciousness a particular affinity with the electromagneticfield: electromagnetic perception, reception, and so on as epitomized by vision.The easiest thing to affect by the phenomena of mind over matter should be theelectromagnetic field.Rupert: There are a lot of people who think the universe is conscious or thatthe soul of the world in some sense is perceiving what’s going on. There aremany theological traditions of divine omniscience. By definition, any theologyof divine omniscience requires the divine mind to know everything. Knowingeverything would include knowing all the properties and states of theelectromagnetic and gravitational fields, so these would be essential aspects ofdivine omniscience.I’ve found that when people think about divine omniscience, they treat it as anentirely miraculous process, totally disconnected from any kind of physicalreality. However, divine omniscience must involve knowing from within—beingwithin all things. Therefore, cosmic omniscience must pervade theelectromagnetic field and all the fields of nature. This is like Newton’s notionthat the medium of divine omniscience was Absolute Space, which he called thesensorium of God.Terence: Why is divine omniscience a necessary concept? Can’t the universe getalong just being partially aware of what’s going on?Rupert: I think that it’s intriguing to consider models of reality in whichthere is a sense of knowing associated with the cosmos.Terence: We all have a sense of knowing, but we’re not omniscient.Rupert: There are two possible models. One is the standard model of secularhumanism, which postulates that our minds are the most advanced in the universe.According to this model, the rest of the universe is essentially unconscious.Living organisms crawled out of the primal broth in an inanimate universe and,through the miracles of random mutation and neo-Darwinian natural selection,gave rise to organisms such as ourselves with complex nervous systems that havethe subjective correlate of consciousness. Human consciousness emerged out ofthe darkness of inanimate nature and is the highest consciousness that exists,although it’s conceivable that intelligent beings have evolved on a few otherplanets as well.The more traditional model derives human consciousness from a much largerconsciousness that pervades the cosmos, the Earth, and the whole of life onEarth. In this model, our consciousness has come about by a kind of diminutionor descent of some higher kind of consciousness rather than by an ascent fromlower, ultimately unconscious matter. We’re a reduced form, a self-contractedversion, of a higher consciousness rather than an inflated version of a lower,animal consciousness.I find it more reasonable to suppose that our minds are in touch with largerminds, and that in many ways they are shaped by larger mental systems ofsocieties and cultures, ecosystems, Gaia, the galaxy, the entire cosmos, andperhaps by a cosmic mind beyond that.Terence: I follow you as far as a Gaian mind because it seems a biologicalobject, not a theological premise. To hypothesize a mind of the whole universeseems unnecessary and unlikely to be encountered.Ralph: Suppose there was another Gaia, another inhabited planet. It would haveits own Gaian mind.Terence: The inhabitants would be citizens of the universe, even as we are.Ralph: Between our Gaian mind and theirs, a dialogue might be in progress.image [images/f0088-01.jpg]Figure 7. Nested Hierarchy. Diagrammatic representation of a nested hierarchy,which could represent subatomic particles in atoms, molecules, or crystals, forexample; cells in tissues, organs, or organisms; or planets in solar systems,galaxies, or galactic clusters.Terence: Nothing of this suggests theology.Ralph: You’re projecting theology onto it in association with the phrase “divineomniscience.” This is usually associated with Yahweh, the one God of theHebrews, and his divine omniscience. It’s unnecessary to make that association.As you’ve gone as far as the Gaian mind, you can certainly go further. There isa hierarchy of worlds in the universe.Terence: I’m not convinced that the hierarchy is minded at every level.Ralph: That’s the question. Does Jupiter have a Jovian mind?Terence: Does the Solar System have a mind?Rupert: In any holistic model of reality, it seems entirely natural to supposethat Gaia has a kind of mind, and that the Gaian mind is embedded in the SolarSystem mind, and the Solar System mind embedded in the galactic mind. Thesehigher levels of mind and consciousness, which may be hard for us to conceiveof, seem likely to exist by a simple logical argument.image [images/f0089-01.jpg]Figure 8. Eye of Horus. The radiant “Eye of Horus” on the Great Seal of theUnited States, as shown on every dollar bill.Terence: But they may not necessarily exist in a hierarchical order. After all,chipmunks are not small portions of whales.Rupert: No, no, no, but chipmunks are not inside whales. Chipmunks are insideterrestrial ecosystems. Whales are in different ecosystems, and both of these,the oceanic and the terrestrial ecosystems are part of Gaia. The hierarchy is ofmore inclusive units; it is a nested hierarchy. The Solar System is not on thesame level as the Earth. It’s a higher level of organization of which the Earthis part. The galaxy is a higher level of which the Solar System is part.Ralph: If you accept a Gaian mind, do you think there’s a similar kind of mindassociated with Jupiter?Terence: Yes. Planets are like animals.Ralph: What about the solar mind?Terence: Other places in the Solar System seem potentially more open to thesupport of recognizable forms of life. The oceans of Europa, for instance.Ralph: Does something need recognizable life to have a mind? In the Gaian mind,not only the so-called living beings have mind. The ecosystem has a mind.Terence: But you don’t want to define mind so broadly that it’s no longerrecognizable as what we say when we ordinarily use the word.Ralph: That’s a problem, I agree. But all these different components of thecosmos appear to fit exactly our model of thinking. To ask if something isconscious or unconscious is a different question that very much complicates theissue.Terence: I’m definitely into the notion that if you can’t have an I-thourelationship with it, it’s fairly uninteresting to call it a mind.Ralph: Do you think then that the Gaian mind would be dead if the human speciesbecame extinct?Terence: Not any more than someone would be dead if an acquaintance dies. Icommunicate with the Gaian mind.Ralph: Then why can’t Jupiter have a Jovian mind without the necessity ofmicrobes?Terence: I grant that. It’s these more diffuse, abiological systems … the sun isa hard step to take.Rupert: The sun has a very complex resonant pattern of magnetic fields withcellular vortices throughout its whole surface. It’s a complex system ofprobabilistic turbulences and resonances with complete polar reversals aboutevery eleven years, at the time of sunspot maxima. There’s a physicalinterface—if a mind has to have a physical interface—that is an electromagneticone at that. The Solar System as a whole involves all the planets, all thegravitational interactions, and the electromagnetic field of the sun, in whicheverything is made manifest through light. This field includes us sitting herein this room and everything else that’s illuminated by it.If light and vision are associated, as we started this trialogue by considering,then all things illuminated by the sun may in some sense be seen by it. The sunis in many cultures called an eye. In Malay, for example, the word for sun ismata hari, “the eye of the day.” On the great seal of the United States, shownon every dollar bill, there is the Egyptian symbol of the Eye of Horus—theradiant eye, the sun—both a seeing eye and an emitter of light.This brings us back to our starting point, the relationship between light andvision. The Eye of Horus is one symbol of their intimate relationship, and it’sno coincidence that it is one of the principal amulets still used in Greece andother Mediterranean countries to ward off the “evil eye.”"},{"pageContent":"image [images/common.jpg]In all times and all places, with the possible exception of Western Europe forthe past two hundred years, a social commerce between human beings and varioustypes of discarnate entities, or nonhuman intelligences, was taken for granted.—Terence McKennaEntities exist in many realms. There are the realms of the dead, the realms ofdreams, and the realms of the imagination. There are also the spirits ofanimals, the spirits of the Earth and solar system and stars, and the angelicstellar intelligences. There are spirits of each species of plant or mushroom,each with its own way of being, its own way of seeing and experiencing theworld, of participating in the whole.—Rupert SheldrakeTraveling up the great chain of being toward the world soul, we may get in touchwith things that precede any capability of verbalization, that seem to reach outfor contact, that are learning to communicate in a language we can understand.—Ralph Abraham"},{"pageContent":"SIXimage [images/line.jpg]EntitiesTerence: This discussion will revolve around the exotic theme of discarnateintelligences and nonhuman entities. These entities seem to occupy a kind ofundefined ontological limbo. Whatever their status in the world, theirpersistence in human experience and folklore is striking. The phenomenon oftheir existence is not something unusual or statistically rare. In all times andall places, with the possible exception of Western Europe for the past twohundred years, a social commerce between human beings and various types ofdisincarnate entities, or nonhuman intelligences, was taken for granted. Thiscould have been as simple as the Celtic farmer’s wife leaving out a pitcher ofmilk for the faerie folk, or it could have taken more elaborate forms.A second aspect of this theme is the tremendous variety of these entities. We’retalking about a kind of parallel taxonomy in another continuum in which thereare djinns, afreets, water nixies, boulder grinders, gnomes—and this is only thelist within the context of the European imagination. Once we add in theviewpoints of various cultures on the potential for nonhuman life forms, we havea truly vast array of peculiar creatures, all expressive of a very fundamentalbelief system that seems to be inherent in the human condition.Before we get into the history of this idea, it might be good to simply reviewthe logical options that are open to us in examining phenomena of this sort.There are basically three. The first option is that these entities are rare, butphysical, and that they have identities somewhere between the coelacanths andBigfoot. They potentially could be imagined moving from the realm of mythologyinto the realm of established zoological fact, and this has in fact happened insome rather unspectacular cases. This is by far the least interesting position.For example, the yeti is a creature that refuses to declare whether it is simplya rare member of the ordinary taxa of this planet or something quite different.The second option that lies before us when we look at the ontological status ofthese entities is what I would think of as the Jungian position. To demonstrateit, I’ll simply quote Jung on the subject of sprites and elementals. He callsthem “autonomous fragments of psychic energy that have temporarily escaped fromthe controlling power of the ego.” This is what I would call thementalist-reductionist approach to discarnate entities and intelligences. Itsays that they are somehow part and parcel of our own minds, their existencedependent upon our conceiving them as objects in our imagination, howeverpathologically expressed.Rupert: In other words, this is the humanist position that all gods, entities,and so on are simply projections of our own minds.Terence: Exactly. The mental projection theory. “Escaped from the controllingpower of the ego”—it’s a wonderful image.The third and obviously most interesting possibility, but the one fraught withargumentative pitfalls, is that these entities are (1) nonphysical and (2)autonomous in their existence in some sense. In other words, they actually carryon an existence independent of their being perceived by human beings. This isthe classical position of those who have had the largest amount of experiencedealing with these entities: the shamans, ecstatics, and so-called sensitivetypes.This position poses a tremendous barrier for the scientific and Western mind.The eradication of spirit from the visible world has been a project prosecutedwith great zeal throughout the rise of modern science. An admission that thisproject overlooked something as fundamental as a communicating intelligentagency co-present with us on this planet would be more than a dangerousadmission of the failure of an intellectual method. It would pretty much sealthe bankruptcy of that method.Science has handled this problem by creating a tiny broom closet within its vastmansion of concerns called “schizophrenia,” deeming it a matter forpsychologists, not the most honored members of the legions of the house ofscience. They have been told to “take care of this problem, please.” This iswhere we get the Jungian mentalist-reductionist model. What’s interesting aboutthis model, which is the reigning model concerning these entities, is that itsappeal is in direct proportion to a person’s lack of direct experience with thephenomenon that it seeks to explain. In other words, anyone who has everencountered a discarnate intelligence knows that this is a woefully inadequatedescription of the phenomenon.Before I close, I want to make one digression to drive home the point that thisphenomenon is not simply the pursuit of dilettantes or obscurantists. If weexamine the history of early modern science, we discover that some of the majormovers and shakers were being guided and directed in the formulation of earlyscience by discarnate entities. John Dee, the great flower of Elizabethanscience, actually had commerce with angels and all sorts of entities of thistype over decades. No less a founder of modern scientific rationalism than RenéDescartes was set on the path toward the ideals of modern science by an angelwho appeared to him in a dream and told him that the conquest of nature was tobe achieved through measure and number. This enunciation, which is really thebattle cry of modern science, first passed through the lips of an angel!There is also the well-known example of Kekulé, the discoverer of the benzenering, who dreamed of the uroboric symbol—the snake taking its tail in its mouth,the ancient symbol of eternity—and understood that it was the solution to amolecular structure problem that he’d been searching for. This aspect ofscience, the fact that much of its premises have been transferred to mankindfrom the hidden realm of higher intelligence, is completely suppressed in itsown official story. The official history tells the story of rational thought, ofconquering the dark world of superstition.I think as we look at these entities and try to place them in the context ofhuman society in order to understand what they can do for us, we need to looktoward the shamanic model. Here the spirits are not only identified but are seenas “helping,” and a symbiosis is envisioned between ourselves and an invisibleworld with higher intent. This is what has been lacking in the expression ofmodern science as a social force. It would be a good idea to inculcate withinany future model of society whatever wisdom and insight is represented by theseforces.It wouldn’t be fair to close without mentioning that science’s aversion to theirrational is something it inherited from Christianity. All of the voices ofnature, of the sky and the Earth, were suppressed by Christianity in favor ofthe mystery of the Trinity. I interpret what’s going on at the present moment asa rebirth, or a rise in volume, of the voices of the elementals. This seems tome part and parcel of the ecological crises of the planet. The planet isattempting to speak. Everything that can signify is reaching out toward humanityto try to reclaim us for the family of nature from the rather pathological tripwe’ve been on for a long time. The elementals, the voices, the promptings ofdiscarnate entities are to be carefully considered and studied. We are wanderingin a wilderness, and they are a prompting voice.Ralph: I’d like to focus on what you said about the suppression of theirrational by science and the trinity of Christianity, which came directly fromthe Neoplatonic tradition. I don’t mean the Trinity of Father, Son, and HolyGhost, but the trinity of body, soul, and spirit. The body is essentially Gaiaof the Orphic trinity; it is ordinary reality, the physical universe of matterand energy. The soul is the oversoul or world soul, the parent of the individualsouls that inhabit us. The spirit is a kind of elastic medium between body andsoul, like the logos or the morphogenetic field. Perhaps discarnate entities areevolving structures in the spirit, which contains information and intelligence.We can identify this as the top layer. There may be a hierarchy of these forms,which become increasingly anthropomorphic as they descend from the soul level tothe body level. The spirit interpolates between the infinite complexity of theworld soul, which includes our minds, and the relative simplicity of the worldbody, which includes our brains.An abstract, cognizant entity may be impossible to know directly because of thecomplexity of the multidimensional spheres of the world soul. But when theentity structure descends, diffusing down through spirit, it becomesincreasingly simple and develops more and more into cognitive forms that belongto the human mind in its evolutionary resonance with morphogenetic fields. Atthese lower levels, the entity is forced into representations that areculturally dependent such as faeries, dakinis, elementals, and so on.This is a Sheldrakian interpretation of the Neoplatonic trinity of Plotinus. Ithas plenty of room for the plethora of entities within the spirit, just asRupert makes plenty of room for biological species in the morphogenetic fieldsthat guide biological morphogenesis. This model allows for a spectrum ofdifferent forms of what are essentially the same entities in differentrepresentations. Entities might be timeless in the celestial sphere, but theydescend into a lowest representation as a cognitive map in our ownconsciousness, a map that depends on our evolving paradigm, our worldview. Forthis reason, there are different cultural flavors: elves, faeries, the pantheonof gods, and so on.Early Christianity had this model. The Bible and Apocrypha are full of angels,archangels, and other entities. I think the Neoplatonic model is a context intowhich we could place all of these different representations. We could includethe saints of all the world religions, the local deities, and all themultifarious representations of entities. The spectrum of representationscorresponding to a single entity is essentially what Jung called an archetype.Terence: Another set of questions is raised if you believe that these entitiesare nonphysical and autonomous. Are they related to us beyond the fact that wecan share the same communication space? Are they somehow related to our ownexistence, not in the sense of being dependent upon it, but in some other way?All this talk of soul and spirit leads to the question of the relationship ofthe dead to these discarnate entities.Did you know that the dogma of purgatory in Christian theology was not createdby theologians in Rome but by Saint Patrick in an effort to make Christiandoctrine more commensurate with Celtic folk beliefs? The faerie faith that wasin place when Patrick landed in Ireland held that dead souls coexist with usinvisibly in ordinary space and can be seen by people who have a specialability. Saint Patrick turned that notion into purgatory, and he was sosuccessful in the conversion of Ireland that theologians in Rome later wrotethis concept into general church dogma.Ralph: The Celtic people came from Eastern Europe, where they had contact withthe cradle of civilization, as it’s called. The view of the Underworldintroduced into church canon by Saint Patrick already existed in Babylonian,Sumerian, and Ugaritic models. In the Sumerian myth of Inanna and Dumuzi, forexample, Inanna goes to speak with her older sister, Ereshkigal, the queen ofthe Underworld. This story of a journey to the land of the dead is very old andruns very deep. The Underworld, as an aspect of the mythological side of birthand death, is part of one of the deepest layers of the mythic tradition. In acave in Iraq, the dead were buried with flowers for the afterlife before 40,000B.C.The Neoplatonic model of spirit filling the void between body and soul may havea prehistory in which spirit was visualized as light. Thus, representations ofentities have occurred in metaphors of light, particularized in whatever formswere available in a given culture. I believe the myth of the Underworld aspurgatory, which goes back at least four thousand years to Sumer, is adisplacement from the void between us and the sky—from the middle realm ofspirit between the terrestrial and celestial spheres. Perhaps this has to dowith the patriarchal takeover and the creation of the unconscious, or perhaps ithas to do with our perpetual difficulty in dealing with death.Terence: It occurs to me that all of these discarnate entities would be butdancing hallucinations before us if not for their ability to address us inlanguages that we can understand. Because they speak, we instantly transfer tothem a whole new power and importance. They are transferring information fromsomewhere to us, only a very small percentage of which we are able to doanything with.A traditional notion as it relates to elves and gnomes is that they areartificers of some sort—master artisans working with metals and jewels.Shamanism begins with a kind of deep penetration into early metallurgy. In thisprocess, the smith and the shaman are twin brothers linked together in theextraction of energy from matter. This “whispering from the demon artificers,”as Jung put it, has led us into technological self-expression and perhaps intoself-expression per se.The fact that these entities speak to us and we understand them is very puzzlingfor the rationalist. Most modern thinkers label this dialogue “schizophrenia”and put it away in a small isolated room and leave it there. However, a fairreading of the history of modern science, as Ralph earlier pointed out, showsthat the irrational, in an objectified form, is very active in the process thatwe call history. We don’t like to admit it, because we’re committed to anofficial philosophy of reason and casuistry.Ralph: There are two different theories going on here in terms of informationtransmission. In the horizontal theory, culture diffuses. For example, theagricultural revolution traveled from Anatolia in 7000 B.C. to France in 4500B.C. to Britain in 3500 B.C. and so on. In the vertical theory, future evolutionand past history depend on inspiration. There is a need to make shamanisticjourneys, to travel vertically up into the logos, the world of spirit, whereinformation is stored and is in a process of evolution. This information mightbe perceived as teachings from elementals, as in the teachings aboutmetalworking received from faerie folk.In this vertical theory, we would expect the faerie folk to show people how towork bronze, for example, in many different places at the same time. TheChalcolithic revolution could have been a simultaneous metamorphosis throughoutthe inhabited world if enough people had done vertical traveling. People likeDescartes and Kekulé and John Dee were open to this vertical dream world,drawing information down from the celestial spheres in order to reinspire theirown generations with this sacred knowledge.These two models are compatible, and we may combine them into a single map thatportrays shamanic journeys vertically and cultural diffusion horizontally. Thismap has two dimensions, whereas modern science and its paradigm have onlyallowed for horizontal diffusion.Terence: Why do you suppose modern science became so adverse to these phenomenaat the same time that there was such a zeal for the cataloging and descriptionof all the productions of ordinary nature?Ralph: I don’t know. There was a fall. It happened in the century between JohnDee and Isaac Newton in England. We can study everything that went on and stillnot understand much of what happened in this short period of time. None of thedevelopments in the scientific enlightenment seemed to be explicitly adverse toangels. Newton believed in astrological alchemy, which embraced the significanceof the stars, the hand of God, and the reality of the trinity of body, soul, andspirit. Descartes and Newton, whom we blame for our mechanistic paradigm, werefull of the spirit. Of course, they dared not speak openly of these thingsbecause of the terrorist repression going on around them in the form ofinquisitions, religious persecutions, and riots. Giordano Bruno was burned atthe stake in front of an enthusiastic audience of three hundred thousand peoplein Rome on Easter Sunday because he refused to accept that the world was finite.Galileo was forced to recant for similar reasons.Somewhere in this story is the basis for the rejection of the spirit by science.Why the church rejected it is another question.Terence: The whole ambience of the world of Renaissance magic was one of liningup resonant incenses, minerals, and colors to call down stellar demons. Out ofthe Renaissance came modern science after the pact was made.Rupert: Starting with the astronomical revolution.Terence: Yes.Rupert: I think discarnate entities are principally experienced by people intheir dreams. In dreams, we travel in strange realms, we meet people who aredead or from different parts of the world, we enter strange situations and haveunpredictable experiences. Our dreams exist in a kind of autonomous realm. Thereductionist theory is that this realm is part of our own psyche. The moretraditional theory is that we travel out of our bodies and enter whattheosophists have called the astral plane. Some people have dreams of angelicbeings. Others have nightmares. Heaven’s pageantry covers many differentregions. People throughout the world believe these regions are autonomous andthat when we dream, we travel out of our bodies into another realm.Entities exist in many realms. There are the realms of the dead, the realms ofdreams, and the realms of the imagination. There are also the spirits ofanimals, the spirits of the Earth and solar system and stars, and the angelicstellar intelligences. There are spirits of each species of plant or mushroom,each with its own way of being, its own way of seeing and experiencing theworld, of participating in the whole.All of these things are part of the shamanic fauna: the wolf spirits, crowspirits, other animal spirits, plant spirits, nature spirits, water spirits,mountain spirits, tree spirits, and so on. If you become like a hawk, you flylike a hawk, you see like a hawk, and you take on a hawklike quality of being.These sort of spirits are biologically grounded. The angelic spirits are rootedin actual stars and planetary systems and galaxies. The whole realm is a systemof intelligences that in some sense or another have a bodily aspect or were atone time in bodies, like the departed.Are all entities grounded in bodily aspects? Or is there a free-floating,totally separate realm of entities of an entirely autonomous nature?Terence: Perhaps everything at one point passes through matter, and that passageallows its eternal existence in an animate but discarnate realm of pure form. Inthis sense, biological existence would be fraught with the intimation ofimmortality.Ralph: I would rather speak of animal souls than animal spirits, preserving theconcept of soul for the ultimate end of the great chain of being. Spirit is asort of elastic medium connecting it all. Spirit may be the venue of our travelsin dreams and shamanistic journeys because we are unable to reach, inconsciousness, all the way to soul. On the soul level, everything is connectedup and all is one, as in the oversoul of Emerson and Thoreau. This great pancakein the sky participates in the material world by ripping off a piece of itselfto incarnate in matter. In this view, which is the essence of the Hermetictradition, everything has soul and souls are permanent. Their occupation asanimals or rocks or trees is temporary.image [images/f0102-01.jpg]Figure 9. A Crop Circle. An example of a “crop circle” formed by the flatteningof the crop. The sides of the triangle are about 180 feet long. This spectacularformation appeared during the night of July 16, 1991, in a wheat field near theancient fort of Barbury Castle in Wiltshire, England. A few crop circles areknown to be hoaxes, but in England in recent years there have been more than twothousand formations of unknown origin. Reproduced courtesy of Richard Wintle.Calyx Photo Services © 1991.In this Hermetic view, we may have the best chance to understand ourselves andour history. History on the scale of the world soul is a process ofmorphogenesis. Incarnation is the materialization of the morphic form, theentity, in the body. It is the morphic resonance of soul and body. Spirit is theabode of the entities, which are particular aspects of morphic forms. Theinteraction between these different planes has been described as a resonant wavephenomenon.When the whole biography of Gaia is seen in this Hermetic view, it may bepossible to get back in touch with soul and be guided into the future. Travelingup the great chain of being toward the world soul, we may get in touch withthings that precede any capability of verbalization, that seem to reach out forcontact, that are learning to communicate in a language we can understand. Thecorn circles in England, for example, apparently are a kind of semioticcommunication in which the cornfields, as organisms in the Gaian soul, aretrying to speak to us. They are developing an alphabet, little by little, justas we developed cuneiform script.Terence: If there were no wind … wouldn’t that be wonderful, if you werestanding there watching and you could feel that the air was still and yet yousaw the corn plants lie down one by one? Then you would understand who’s behindthis phenomenon. It’s the Earth.Rupert: If it turns out that the corn circles are in fact what the mostpersuasive school of rationalistic explainers believes they are—namely, focusedwhirlwinds—they may still be the world soul communicating with us. Suddenly,whirlwinds take on entirely new patterns of focus and write new patterns.There’s a spirit behind the whirlwinds that really expresses something, as manytraditions have always believed.Ralph: Gaia uses whatever means of writing she can find. If wind is necessary,if electromagnetic fields are necessary, then so be it.Terence: The spiral form of the whirlwind is probably an extremely complexorganized entity, an expression of the ordered morphology of the galaxy,resembling DNA. It is perhaps a higher form of life, but still manifesting thespiral energy form. Just as early scientists were shaped in their ideas byconversations with entities, perhaps we are on the verge of some kind ofcommunications breakthrough. Perhaps, in order to have commerce and treaties andthe exchange of patents with the invisible entities behind the corn circles, weneed to bring to them all we’ve learned. Perhaps, applying differential calculusand the theory of hyperfine reactions, we may be able to work out a differenttreaty than we could have when we only understood blowguns and canoemanufacture.Rupert: That’s where mathematical modeling comes in.Ralph: I have in mind a mathematical model for the world soul, the spirit, andthe mundane body that I would like to run as a video game in arcades or atDisneyland. The bad habits of science in the past four hundred years have hadthe unfortunate effect of depriving us of such a mathematical model. Ourunderstanding of the material world, Gaia, or of the universe, the body of itall, is more advanced than our understanding of spirit, souls, faeries, orangels.Terence: I wonder how accurate and reliable are the maps that occultists haveaccumulated in the past couple of hundred years. What struck me, when I firstread A. E. Waite’s Ceremonial Magic, was the classification of entities aslieutenants, generals, and majors. Each was assigned different metals, each itsown sigil, and each offered its own dedicated incenses.Ralph: A. E. Waite is an excellent example of the Hermetic view ofspirit/logos/m-field as an elastic medium between body and the end of the greatchain of being, soul. His model was inherited from the revelation to John Dee ofan earlier magic, originally from the literature of pre-Christian Jews andChaldeans in Jerusalem and Alexandria. According to the Merkabah mystics, thereare eight heavens that can be visualized as concentric spheres. In the eighthheaven is God in his/her own castle, and along the way there is, in odd places,a chariot with wheels. Holding up the chariot is a being with four faces, onefacing in each direction. To enter the chariot there are four gates, each witheight guardians, four on each side, and each with passwords and special signs.Rupert: What personal experience do we have of entities? Have you ever met one?Could we try and meet one by carrying out an appropriate ceremony or invocationin a suitably receptive pharmacological or meditative state? If there are starspirits, as I believe is perfectly possible, it’s very likely that we can invokethem by various kinds of magic. What kind of information would such beingsimpart? We know that ancient civilizations had widespread beliefs about theparticular properties of various stars. Most accounts of angels describe them asinnumerable as the stars. The connection between angels and stars is veryexplicit in the Christian tradition.Terence: In a suitably receptive pharmacological state, the stage suddenlybecomes crowded with stellar demons, Earth angels, and what have you.Rupert: Do we know for sure these are stellar demons? Have you ever connectedyour experience of a demon with a direct look at his resident star?Ralph: We have this experience in a limited way. The sky is sort of like aRorschach test. There are a lot of dots that can be connected in many ways. Whenthere is a tradition of connecting them in a certain way, there is anastrological tradition, a star mythology, an asterism. Pictographs, petroglyphs,and cave paintings include drawings of asterisms. The Greek myths are projectedonto the celestial sphere in the asterisms we call constellations. The word mythis from the word mythos, meaning “lyric” or the words of songs from rituals.Myths gained the power they now have in our conscious and unconscious livesthrough their secondary role in rituals. The old rituals were actually means tobring the celestial forms down from the soul level, through the spirit level,and into the body. This is where star magic worked successfully to empower ourevolution, and this is as sure as we can be of the existence of star demons.Terence: In our culture, we tend to move into cities that push nature away fromus. In our mental environment, we do the same thing. Most people live within avery conventionalized set of notions that are deeply imbedded in a larger set ofnotions. When we go to the physical edges, such as desert, jungle, and remoteand wild nature, and when we go to the mental edges with meditation, dreams, andpsychedelics, we discover an extremely rich flora and fauna in the imagination.This realm is ignored because of our tendency to see in words, to build inwords, and to turn our backs on the raging ocean of phenomena that wouldotherwise entirely overwhelm our metaphors.Rupert: If we ask what has caused this blindness, we might answer that it’s thesatanic spirit of science. In the seventeenth century, the spirit of Satan wasportrayed in Milton’s Paradise Lost, with a whole taxonomy of various demons andfallen angels that acted as malevolent powers, such as Mammon, the demon ofcommercial greed. The primary sin of Satan and of the other fallen angels likeMammon was pride, the turning away from God toward their own self-sufficiency.This was the beginning of the whole humanist illusion that turned away from thespirit world and declared humans to be self-sufficient. From this point of view,all gods, demons, and spirits are projections of the human mind, creating a kindof anthropocentric universe.Terence: Humans are said to be the measure of all things.Rupert: This is humanism. To adopt the alternative tradition of animism and torecognize the living spirits and souls of all nature is profoundly repugnant tohumanism, yet it is the common ground of all human civilization, thought, andtradition. As in Goethe’s Faust, the paradigmatic scientist sells his soul tothe devil in return for unlimited knowledge and power. The guiding spirit ofmodern science, according to the Faust myth, is a satanic demon, a fallen angelcalled Mephistopheles.How seriously do we need to take the idea that our whole society andcivilization is under the possession of such a spirit, worshiped through moneyand power? Milton describes Mammon in Paradise Lost:Even in heaven his looks and thoughtsWere always downward bent, admiring moreThe riches of Heaven’s pavement, trodden gold,Than aught divine or holy else enjoyedIn vision beatific: by him firstMen also, and by his suggestion taught,Ransacked the centre, and with impious handsRifled the bowels of their Mother EarthFor treasures better hid.(1.680–88)This is an accurate description of our whole civilization. How much are fallenangels actually guiding and perverting the progress of science and technology?Is a great war between the good and evil angels being acted out on Earth? Wehardly know how to think or talk about such possibilities since they are soalien to the official, standard models of Western history.Terence: Returning to the subject of discarnate entities, I keep going back tothis thing about language. It’s as though the field of language itself must beprepared for communication with these beings. In the West, there has been apeculiar stiffening of language against the ability to express this kind ofcommunication, but it is beginning now to break down.Ralph: It’s true. We have to misuse our language even to talk about thesethings.Terence: Linearity in print and thought has made language unable to deal withthe invisible world in any meaningful way, except as pathology. Now thisinvisible world is returning to the language through people like us with onefoot in each world.The human mind is haunted both by the many presences sensed within the self andby a confused sense of self. Wherever we turn in the world of nature and thepsyche, we encounter life, animation and a willingness to communicate thatconfounds the fragile pyramid of boundary consciousness and human values thathave emerged over historical time through the suppression of our intuitions.I’ve taken the position that these entities we encounter are nonphysical andsomehow autonomous. Ralph, as I understand him, accepts this view but anchors itinto the Neoplatonic trinity of body, soul, and spirit. From this point of view,these entities are inhabitants of the spiritual domain of the logos. They arethe logos become self-reflecting and articulate. Rupert correctly points outthat it’s in the realm of dreams that we most commonly encounter entities, andhe further suggests that behind these entities is the controlling agency of theworld soul. His notion is that the world soul actually communicates to humanbeings through the production of forms that we interpret as the denizens of anotherwise invisible and mythological world.Our collective conclusion seems to be that nature, both in whole and in manyparts, is magically self-reflecting and aware. Encountered in its most rarifiedexpression, the world speaks to us, and we, as scientific rationalists, areconfounded. Nevertheless, it is for us to mold our models and theories to theworld as it presents itself in immediate experience, not as we would have it insome grand and sterile abstraction. The elves and gnomes are there to remind usthat, in the matter of understanding the self, we have yet to leave the playpenin the nursery of ontology."},{"pageContent":"image [images/f0110-01.jpg]By giving people a less restricted choice of addictions, we can cause somegrowth in consciousness and some shrinkage of the unconscious. I think it’s notnecessary to make the whole unconscious become conscious.

It is as ifsensory awareness takes place on the surface of a largely unconscious system. Onthe shimmering surface we notice differences, but below the surface ishabituation and unconscious habit. This is at the heart of all living systems.—Rupert SheldrakeThe reclamation of the unconscious has to do with directing attention towardunderstanding time. Time is apparently the body of the unconscious.—Terence McKenna"},{"pageContent":"SEVENimage [images/line.jpg]The UnconsciousRalph: I would like to start with three great bifurcations in the history ofconsciousness. The first is hypothetical: the unconscious was created oneafternoon by a bifurcation in the collective mind. At this point, a curtain wascreated that divided the conscious from the unconscious forever, like an IronCurtain in the species mind. The second great bifurcation in the history ofconsciousness was the Fall from the Garden of Eden, which was the origin ofevil. The third great bifurcation was the defeat of the dragons of chaos by thegods of law and order.With respect to the first bifurcation, we could speculate that in theprehistoric period the conscious mind developed from the unconscious mind. Or,it may have been the other way around—that both existed always and there wasnever any division.However, for the sake of discussion, let’s say that consciousness existed alwaysand that the unconscious was created by a recent bifurcation, a prehistoricconsequence of a natural law of evolution. Because of peculiarities in theevolution of the conscious mind, more and more perceptions were regarded asillegal in the context of culture and civilization and the current worldview. Intime, as more things from above the curtain were forced below it, theunconscious continued to grow as the conscious mind correspondingly shrank. Inthis continuing evolution and growth, there were further bifurcations, and allof the fundamental deck furniture of the unconscious, including dreams andarchetypal symbols, emerged.One virtue of this theory is that it allows us to see our individual consciousminds evolve from a universal conscious mind. We may then speak of theconsciousness of animals, of plants, of Mother Earth and Father Sky, and of thewhole nuclear family of all and everything.The second bifurcation dealt with the creation of evil, the expulsion of Adamand Eve from the Garden of Eden, the fall of Lucifer, and the empowerment of thenegative. Lots of dichotomies emerged from unity by a process of mitosis, orbifurcations, in the world of ideas. We could try to relate these events to eachother in time, or in space, or as waves, or as a holistic space/time pattern.image [images/f0112-01.jpg]Figure 10. The Three Great Bifurcations of Cultural History.Number three was the bifurcation of chaos and order in the cosmos. As mentionedpreviously, this horror story was ritually enacted during the Babylonian NewYear festival. The king played the role of Marduk, who divided Tiamat, thedragon goddess of chaos, in two with a sword. She opened like an oyster shell,forming the sky and the Earth.These three bifurcations are related. When the myth of Marduk became dominant, anegative charge was put on the serpent image. The snake is an essential symbolof Mother Earth herself. The consciousness of Gaia came to be associated withHades, the underground, death, evil, Pluto, and so on. The repression of chaosreinforced the bifurcation in consciousness that gave us the unconscious, whichhas gained ever since. Thus, the human species has been heading more and moreinto the evil, the demonic, and the evolutionarily unsuccessful forms ofsociety.This is the chaos theory of the bifurcation of mind or the creation of theunconscious.Terence: What do you think caused this bifurcation?Ralph: I don’t know. Historically, there is this horrific story, the Babyloniancreation myth—a myth as lyric opera and ritual. This myth had a Sumerianprecedent. Towns in the early stages of the urban revolution coalesced arounddifferent gods and goddesses. The form of a goddess or god was materialized inthe form of a city. This was the origin of the sacred city. There was thereforea morphogenesis in the full complex of population movement, urban technology,city design, religion, ritual, and so on. The successful god or goddess conceptswere attractors that created cities. These cities resonated with other cities,and through this syncretism empires were created.There are books about the serpent and dragon images in mythology. Many cultureshad dragon images, and they were all associated with chaos and the Goddess.Then, suddenly, there was Saint George killing the dragon and Saint Michael withhis foot on the dragon’s throat. All this energy was given to killing dragons inBabylon, in Canaan, in Celtic mythology, in Christianity, and in science.I think it’s possible that this particular bifurcation had to do with thepatrilineal necessity of knowing the identity of a child’s father and with therejection of the Dionysian ritual in which sexual license was an important part.The patrilineal structure involved the creation of the nuclear family, whichbrought about the rejection of the Goddess, the dragon, and chaos. Now, I thinkit may be important to undo this repression and have Saint George and the dragonget it on together in a May Day celebration where Dionysian elements areaccepted.Rupert: So you’re in favor of a kind of “fall” theory of the unconscious.Ralph: I’m proposing it for discussion. I’m trying it out. It’s an hypothesiswhich, if we accept, we could seek also to escape. Somehow, we’d have amechanism to escape because we’d have a historical map of the creation itself.Terence: How would this escape happen?Ralph: We could try to bring unconsciousness back into consciousness. We couldtake the deck furniture from the lower floors of the boat back up to the maindeck where it belongs. In chaos theory, which is the current paradigm shift,science, which is now the main temple of law and order, has to eat humble pieand accept chaos again. This is apparently happening more or less accidentally.Suppose we were having this talk in 1960, and we decided we would try to dosomething intentional that would restore Tiamat to her throne. We’d hunt aroundwith the computer people, we’d locate a closet chaos pioneer like Ueda orLorenz, and we’d popularize his model. We would purposefully revolutionize thesciences in 1963 instead of waiting for this to happen spontaneously in 1973.I’m not recommending an intentional intervention. I’m saying that bringing someof these things into consciousness would leave a big effect on futuregenerations. This discussion alone could be all it takes, you see, to bringsomething back from the basement and restore it to consciousness, starting a newupward spiral somewhere in the evolution of spirit.Terence: The suppression of psychedelics occurred at the same phase becauseorgies driven by the psychedelic style of religious celebration completelyfrustrated the desire to identify male paternity.Ralph: The rejection of psychedelics and shamanism could be likewise associatedwith these three bifurcation events. Only so-called primitive societies haveshamans and perform psychedelic rituals on a regular basis. Their survival infringe societies is a vestigial tail. They are survivors of the fall, of theloss of a whole complex of ideas.Terence: The shift from the psychology of a psilocybin-mushroom cult to thepsychology of an intoxicating-mead cult, for example, would have led preciselyto the difference in interpersonal dynamics that would have shifted a group frompartnership relationships to patriarchal relationships. I think that, over time,the mushroom-using people in the archaic Sahara were transformed unwittinglyinto a mead cult by a scarcity of mushrooms and by the simultaneous recognitionthat honey was the potential preserving medium for the mushrooms. The effort topreserve mushrooms in honey and to concentrate the use of them into occasionallarge festivals eventually evolved into the mead festivals, where mushroomsbecame no more than a flavoring in mead and ultimately became no more than amemory.Ralph: First the mead, then the patriarchy?Terence: The patriarchy and the mead evolved together, along with the concernfor male paternity and the suppression of orgies. The critical decision was thechoice between fun, on the one hand, and the full knowledge of the flow of one’sgenes, on the other. Once male paternity became an important issue, then theconcept of “me and mine” came into existence: “my women,” “my children,” “myfood,” “my weapons,” “my land.” This is the attitude that the orgiastic,psychedelic, boundary-dissolving mushroom religion held at bay.Ralph: This is an alternative to the theory that patriarchy came about becauseof a wave of invading Kurgans.Terence: It would have happened quite naturally, beginning with a flourishingmushroom cult on the plains of Africa and the gradual climatic drying thatcreated the seasonality of the mushroom. There were wonderful huge seasonalcelebrations, and the psychology of the group remained basically intact. Then,as the drying continued and the waterholes became further and further apart, theneed to preserve the sacrament and to spread it ever more thinly became strong.Desertification of the Sahara also occurred through overgrazing by patriarchal,ownership-oriented pastoralists who worshiped the male thunderbolt god. Theactual use of the land, in the eradication of partnership-orientedhunter-gatherers, created a desiccated environment unable to produce mushrooms.Thus, the psychedelic mysteries slowly faded from the occupied zone of theculture using them, and an only partially satisfying substitute took theirplace.image [images/f0116-01.jpg]Figure 11. A Mushroom Artifact. Such an object is assumed to indicate aMesoamerican cult of mushroom use that flourished more than two thousand yearsago. From a private Canadian collection. Greif-Czolowsksi Photography © 1988.Ralph: Booze.Terence: They went from an ecstatic Goddess cult of orgy to a drunken revelry ofwarriors and whores.Ralph: It’s a two-phase theory: the psychedelic partnership phase and thealcoholic dominator phase. These are drug-driven phase transformations repeatingthemselves in an endless flip-flop in the history of consciousness. There ishistorical evidence of this in Crete, where in historical times there was thedebasement of Dionysian rituals into alcoholic revels.Terence: Dionysus turned into Bacchus. The early Bacchus was a frighteningfigure. His practitioners fell into such frenzies of ecstasy that they werecharged with devouring their own children. The late, hairy-footed, lasciviousBacchus is simply an image of alcoholic consciousness made concrete.Ralph: Orpheus was a reformer who was trying to get the Dionysian religion backon the psychedelic track, away from booze. Such a reform happened again withPythagoras, then with Buddha, and so on.If we take this two-phase theory seriously for a moment, and we favor one phasemore than the other, then we would be inclined to seek the mechanism of phasetransition; an example of such a mechanism would be turning on the heat underwater so that it will boil. This theory explains why alcohol is legal andmarijuana is not. There is a self-preserving, phase-maintaining function withinthe alcohol phase.Terence: It reinforces male dominance. If we analyze what alcohol doespharmacologically, we find that it actually diminishes sensitivity to socialcueing. This is a technical way of saying that when you drink alcohol, you turninto a bore and a libidinally driven oaf. Your normal social judgment isimpaired and you’re prepared to make a sexual conquest. Most of the sexualneurosis of Western civilization can be traced to incidents of early sexualimprinting in the presence of alcohol. Alcohol is so spun into our simultaneousterror and attraction for the sexual experience that it has become an invisiblepart of our cultural legacy.It’s a matter of the way in which our relationships to the material world,especially drugs, promote or retard the expression of what we’re calling theunconscious. One of the things that repels us all about drug abuse is that it isunexamined behavior. When we are addicted to heroin or television, we turn 90percent of our lives into an indwelling in the unconscious.Ralph: I feel that I’m unable to become totally unaddicted. I don’t have to beaddicted to alcohol. I can replace one addiction with something else. I canactually choose, reclaiming free will without rejecting addiction.Terence: This is the kind of creature we are. The addiction to addictions thatspawned this itch originally was no addiction at all but rather our naturalconnection into the hierarchy of Gaian information that was accessible to uswhen the nature religions were freely practiced. A sacrament is not a symbol.The day people were sold on the notion that a sacrament was a symbol, theumbilical connection to the logos was severed, and history was run off track.Ralph: By giving people a less restricted choice of addictions, we can causesome growth in consciousness and some shrinkage of the unconscious. I think it’snot necessary to make the whole unconscious become conscious. If we can’t undothis bifurcation in which the mental curtain developed, we can at leastrearrange the furniture a little bit. What else can be done, besides diminishingalcoholism, to advance consciousness, develop spiritual telescopes to look intothe unconscious, and regain our wisdom?Rupert: I don’t think the problem is that the unconscious is the result of akind of conspiracy or fall but that nature works through the formation ofhabits. We know from our own experiences that habit formation involves habitsbecoming unconscious. We experience habituation, for example, when we go into aroom with a funny smell. After a while, we stop noticing the smell. The sameapplies to background noise: we get used to it. We share with the entire animalkingdom, right down to the level of unicellular organisms, this tendency tobecome unaware of most of the environmental stimuli acting upon us.It seems that the focus of attention or awareness is quite narrow. In general,what sensory systems do throughout the animal kingdom is sense differences—insmell, temperature, pressure, or texture. It is as if sensory awareness takesplace on the surface of a largely unconscious system. On the shimmering surfacewe notice differences, but below the surface is habituation and unconscioushabit. This is at the heart of all living systems.I don’t think there’s a kind of sinister conspiracy of the unconscious. Perhapsa sharper awareness of the interface between the conscious and unconsciousdeveloped at one time—through mystical experience, psychedelic visions, andshamanic journeying—revealing realms of experience of which we are not normallyaware. We can bring other realms of experience into consciousness through ritualpractices such as the annual cycle of festivals found in all religions. Throughritual practices still found almost everywhere, even in the West—including,Jewish festivals, the Catholic calendar of saints’ days, and major festivalslike Easter and Christmas—different dimensions are brought into awareness.We can’t be conscious of everything all the time. We have a limited focus ofattention.Terence: You’re saying a calendar can be an engine for illuminating theunconscious?Rupert: Yes.Ralph: I think the theory of habituation is a good model. In it, the mind isviewed as essentially unconscious, and consciousness, is seen as a little windowthat can be directed at will—by ritual or voluntary choice—over a certain partof the unconscious, which would then become conscious for a day. The unconsciousI spoke about before is a region of the whole realm of consciousness whosecontents have become unavailable because they were declared illegal at a certaintime in history. It’s not possible to rove the window over this region any more.Rupert: Perhaps because it doesn’t have its day. The orgy principle had its day,and it still does in the Hindu festival of Holi: people get high on cannabis,throw colored water at each other, have priapic processions, and overturn thesocial order. Similar principles are at work in the Catholic world throughCarnival or Mardi Gras. However, these festivals were suppressed in Protestantcountries as a result of the Reformation. Chaos in the West no longer has itsday, nor does the Great Mother have hers.Ralph: By focusing our attention through special days and rituals, we can workat maintaining our consciousness much as we work at maintaining our garden. Thisis a good theory of the importance of holidays, but there is still somethingwrong. Every year Christmas is repeated, but people have completely forgottenits archetypal significance, even with the full regalia of angels on the treesand so on.Rupert: The archetypal delight of Christmas is experienced by young childrenwaking up on Christmas Day and seeing stars and angels and presents, withglittering frost and fresh snow in the background. For them, the magic ofChristmas works. It is, after all, a young children’s festival because itcelebrates the birth of the sacred child. This is the pole it touches in all ofus: the sacred child. I think it still helps to maintain the basic pulse of thesacred year, however sluggishly, in a lot of people.Terence: Notice that what you are suggesting is that the reclamation of theunconscious has to do with directing attention toward understanding time. Timeis apparently the body of the unconscious.Ralph: Time is the mediator of differences. Time is the enemy of habituation.Time is the strategy for subverting sensory inhibition.Terence: Time is the theater of habituation as well. Time and attention usedcreatively can banish the unconscious.Ralph: What about the dark part of the unconscious, over which it’s illegal,difficult, perhaps even impossible to fly our plane to look out the window ofconsciousness? The experience of the window of consciousness is our heritage ofperception, but it has been denied to us on the basis of religious authority anddogma maintained by ritual. We can’t reclaim a dark part of our unconscioussimply by a willingness to devote one day to attention, to variation, toobservance of a difference, or to amplification of this part of the unconscious.It has just become unavailable.Denial, I think, is a recent phenomenon, and it is a serious danger forevolution because, once an experience is denied, evolution is then shunted offits track. This kind of unconsciousness, I still think, was created at a certaintime in history by a bifurcation. Somewhere around six thousand years ago, therewas a special new mode of thought involving the prohibition of valid experience.This was the real fall, on the basis of which we now have real evil as a problemin life. The destruction of integrity and the death of nature are new problemswith a history that has to do with denial.After something has become not okay, it’s very hard to reclaim it, For example,chaos is considered bad, and it’s very hard to undo this damage.Terence: What I hear you saying, Ralph, is that some fundamental boundary mustbe breached or dissolved in a dramatic way to confirm that we’ve entered a newphase of the human adventure. Perhaps, the revolution in media and informationtechnologies is the transparently transforming solvent that, by informing usconcerning the real options available to human beings, can get us off thelimited Western approach. It’s important to create and make strong our mentalcommunity.Ralph: I think it’s possible to raise the frequency, to lighten the dark,through prayer. I’d like to see a resurrection of magic. Hopefully, many placesthat have fallen into disuse, where the garden is overrun with weeds, can besweetened with banishment ceremonies, prayers, and so on. We need to learn thistechnology—to connect the star magic of the Stonehenges and astrology, forexample, with the progress of daily life and political events.We have great powers that aren’t being used because we don’t believe in them.The unavailable unconscious contains enormous power for doing good and canprovide us with our only means for recovery."},{"pageContent":"image [images/f0124-01.jpg]The resacralization of space and time involves not only recognizing thesacredness of churches and cathedrals and traditional festivals, but recognizingthe importance of sacred places everywhere and of every kind…. This involves amuch more animistic version of Christianity and Judaism, a process I’ve come tothink of as the greening of God.—Rupert SheldrakeWe need a unifying principle and attractor. The essence is an actual connectionto the sacred. I don’t think we can have an archaic revival by simply goingbackward. We have to carry our archaeology of knowledge to the point where weunderstand the essence of what took place in the past and then adjust it intomodern forms.—Ralph AbrahamThe purpose of science should be understanding, not only technique. We need tohold back while we assimilate what we know at our current level, not pushrelentlessly deeper into the application of techniques. That is rape. That isviolation.—Terence McKenna"},{"pageContent":"EIGHTimage [images/line.jpg]The Resacralization of the WorldRalph: The story of my religious training and upbringing may be appropriate tointroduce our discussion on the resacralization of the world.My parents both came from Jewish backgrounds. My mother was a regular templevisitor in her town until she married. My father had no connection with Jewishtraditions since his parents relocated from New York to the backwoods of Vermontin their youth. There was never mention of Jewish religious stuff in our house,as I think he developed an aversion to organized religion of any sort.Occasionally, circumstance would bring me into church while a service was goingon, and would look around at the other people who bowed their heads when toldto, thinking, “I’m the only one who’s not casting my eyes down; I’m the only onewho doesn’t believe this stuff.”My father developed a kind of religion of his own, centered on the family and ona concept of love that was fairly abstract. He used to say that love waseverything. Explicitly, he thought it was better to start practicing religionwhen you were an adult, when you could acquire whatever religious training youwanted, considering all options with an open mind. I never considered all withan open mind, nor did I decide whether to have one or none; I just didn’t botherto think about it.Practically everybody I knew either went to some kind of church or had beenbrought up within one and had formally rejected it. From them I got no evidenceof any sacred knowledge outstanding in any of these churches. Eventually, thesixties happened, and with LSD I had what I would now identify as my firstreligious experience. Immediately, I thought, as did many people in those days,that this was a religious experience in the true sense of religion.Reading history, I came to see that there had indeed been sacred knowledge inthe churches of Europe in the past. It was embodied in architecture and musicand had become extinct in the Western world only recently. But the sixties werevery preoccupied with politics, so these were just idle thoughts at the time.When I got to India in the seventies, I found that the extinction of the sacredfrom organized religion hadn’t occurred there. Instead, I found a livingtradition that I recognized as sacred.When I returned from India to California, about the time I met Terence, I beganto think there might be a way to revitalize the Western tradition. Other peoplespoke about this idea: those concerned with yoga and with the adepts of theMiddle Ages and Renaissance, Theosophists, and students of alchemy. In 1972,there was a distinct separation between political activity and concerns aboutthe loss of the sacred from religion. In the course of time, it was suggestedthat a root cause of the political problems of the world was the loss of ourconnection to the sacred, within and without organized religion. When thisconnection was made, political activity had to address it.People have different theories of evil and the causes of global problems.Because of the strength of my direct experience with the sacred, desacralizationbecame and remains my favorite theory. I believe that the most importantactivity to save the world, or at least to move toward hope in that direction,is to recreate for some larger portion of humanity the lost thread of ourconnection to the sacred. This is the program that I call “the resacralizationof the world.”As far as I know, there are only a few proposals for direct action in thisdirection. One is the resumption, in everyday society, of rituals that stillexist for some native peoples—rituals such as tribal shamanism. Another is therevitalization of existing religion by attracting people back to the wonderfulchurches of the world. These churches have not only the architectural shape mostappropriate for the communication of the sacred thread, but they have traditionas well, which is the morphic field of our connection with the sacred. We canreconnect the missing link through an archaeology of knowledge. We can attemptto find when and for what reason the light went out and then attempt to reforgethe link.A third proposal is for people to remain within the context of modern societybut outside the organized churches, replacing churches with an equivalentinstitution based perhaps in the sacred arts of music, architecture, andpainting.A fourth idea, to which we all may have given too much attention, is therevitalization of science. This proposal acknowledges that science has replacedtraditional Christian mythology with its own substitute mythology and thatweaknesses in this mythology may be at the root of evil.A fifth idea has to do with the reestablishment of the partnership society. Thework of people like Riane Eisler suggests that the desacralization anddevitalization of the church and organized religion is associated with theembodiment of patriarchal values within organized religion. This is a corollaryof the mechanistic tendency of dominator societies.I don’t think everybody should take psychedelics or have a shamanisticexperience in the Amazon jungle to rebuild their connection to the divine.However, churches and their rituals could be reinvigorated if a certain class ofpriesthood specialized in maintaining this kind of direct, Gnostic connection.The weakness of scientific mythology can then be fixed by somehow incorporatingthe scientific worldview into the expanded church view. There would be some sortof syncretism between the neopagan and the Judeo-Christian traditions, repairingthe patriarchal weakness and restoring revelation with the inclusion of a newsacrament.In short, I’m looking for something beyond the understanding of the virtues ofthe past. I’m looking for the basis of a program in the present, with theresacralization of art and music as an integral part of the program.Terence: You’re talking about an archaic revival: the resumption of ritual, therevitalization of existing religion, and feminism and the revitalization ofpartnership in there somewhere. Sometimes you seem to be talking about arevitalization of the forms of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, andsometimes about forms from much further back. All this business about music andchurches is relatively recent.Ralph: This loss has been going on for ten thousand years. What has been lostcan’t be revived in its original form. We may have to use video and filmtechnology. The value of getting true partnership-society values into the churchis that we wouldn’t have to replace the church just because it’s been on thewrong track for four thousand years.image [images/f0128-01.jpg]Figure 12. A Green Man. An example of a green man, with foliage coming out ofhis mouth. Such foliate heads are a common but mysterious image in gothicchurches and cathedrals. This one is from the fifteenth century, in the churchof Llangwm in Wales. Reproduced courtesy of Clive Hicks.Rupert: Practically all of the Gothic cathedrals are still functioning; theystill have sacred chants going on every day, and prayers are offered in aregular cycle, just as great temples have always done. These continuouslyactive, sacred places have been sacred for centuries. The great cathedrals, liketemples, are models of the cosmos. In the artwork of most Gothic cathedralsthere are green men, mysterious vegetation gods that burst out everywhere withleaves coming out of their mouths. Many of the great cathedrals are dedicated toOur Lady, who in the Middle Ages was often seen as Wisdom, or Sophia. They havein their windows geometrical designs: threefold, fourfold, and fivefoldmandalas. There are rose windows with extremely complex psychedelic designs andcolors. By participating in the spirit of these cathedrals, we can reconnectwith the sacred places of Europe.Another important route for resacralization is through the practice of festivalsand the sacralization of time. Some Jewish people I know are revitalizing thetradition of the Sabbath, starting on Friday evening with the lighting of thecandles and the invocation of the Shekinah, the feminine presence of God in thehome, in the world, and in embodied existence.The sacralization of time is a way of reconnecting ourselves with religioustraditions. I think the most important aspect of this process—because I agreewith Terence about archaic revival—is to find the pre-Christian roots thatunderlie the timing and quality of existing forms and festivals. We need toground the new religion in the old. In the present tradition, there’s acontinuous living strand that goes right back to the pre-Christian shamanicsocieties of Europe and the pre-Jewish shamanic societies of the Middle East.This is a connection that can still work; it works for me. Obviously, theresacralization of space and time involves not only recognizing the sacrednessof churches and cathedrals and traditional festivals, but recognizing theimportance of sacred places everywhere and of every kind: holy wells andsprings, sacred hills and groves, ancient sacred caves, and the archaic sacredplaces of the megalithic age. This involves a much more animistic version ofChristianity and Judaism, a process I’ve come to think of as the greening ofGod. Theologians like Matthew Fox have exposed a hidden strand within theJudeo-Christian tradition that can authenticate and feed a new burgeoning ofChristian and Jewish animism.Ralph: But is it possible? I’m not sure.Terence: Marshall McLuhan said it was inevitable. He felt that the shift from aliterate phonetic-alphabet culture, which existed for us as recently as the1940s, to the electronic culture would affect the ratio of the senses. The newratio created by electronic media would be similar to that which existed inmedieval Europe before the invention of printing. He based this notion of“electronic feudalism” on the idea that before the linear uniformity ofmechanical print we had to look at each individual manuscript, because everymanuscript reflected the hand of its author. After print was invented, we nolonger looked; we read. Reading is a very generalized function in which we don’tactually study each e and l.With television and electronic media, we are again returned to the situationwhere we must look. We must assemble a gestalt, an image; we cannot simply readit. McLuhan felt that the consequences of this shift in the sense ratio would beglobal and immense—that it would cause the fragmentation and dissolution of thenation-state, which we certainly seem to be seeing in Eastern Europe and theSoviet Union. He said it would return people to a kind of homebound pietisticfundamentalism—homebound because electronic media brings information everywhere.McLuhan predicted that all of these factors would conspire to create an era inwhich the Gothic model would be very strongly expressed.From my own point of view, in my theory of the time wave, I see this coming inthe mid-nineties and expect this period of time to have as many ambiguousaspects as did the Middle Ages. On the one hand, there was the glory of theGothic cathedrals, and on the other hand, it was a time of wanderingflagellants, pestilence, bigotry, suppression of women, hatred of outsiders,insularity, provincialism, barbarism, and so forth.I think we’re in an excellent position to experience something very much likethe Gothic revival you’re advocating. The important thing is to humanize theimpulse.Ralph: We need a unifying principle and attractor. The essence is an actualconnection to the sacred. I don’t think we can have an archaic revival by simplygoing backward. We have to carry our archaeology of knowledge to the point wherewe understand the essence of what took place in the past and then adjust it intomodern forms. We have to acknowledge, for example, that the total population islarger now. That means recycling is mandatory. That means green consciousness,Gaia consciousness, will have to play a leading role in rituals performed onvarious days. The mandate is to create a new mythology that can organizedifferent styles of churches on the path of convergent evolution.Rupert: I think religious reform cannot come from the traditional religioushierarchy but must come through an attractive new movement that is practiced inpeople’s lives and spreads through example.Ralph: There’s a real gap in the strategies for starting a new system betweenthose based on archaic or pagan revival and those based on revolution in thechurches or resacralization by religion. The traditional church denies thevalidity of archaic pagan forms, a denial carried to the extreme of revisinghistory and pulverizing goddess figurines and statues. Besides partnership ofthe genders, local control, and a green politic within the ritual of the church,there must be acknowledgment of the essential religiosity of the pagan forms.Rupert: If there were to develop a true Mother Earth religion, it would probablyhave priestesses rather than priests, because its central figure is a goddess.It would relate human life to the Earth first and foremost. Our bodies return tothe Earth. Such a religion would be into the whole material cycle, with littleemphasis on the stars or the heavens. I think it would become veryclaustrophobic for a lot of people before very long. There would then be reborna religion that brought in the aspiration toward the stars, the heavens, thegreatness of the cosmos. We’d have a choice of religious images. We couldchoose, for example, between a god or a goddess of the heavens.Ralph: We are envisioning a revolution of religion in which there would bepriests, priestesses, local control, a renewal of meaning in rites and rituals,and so on. Unfortunately, there has been a continual decline in attendance atchurches. The fact that a revival may be already underway is of no great useunless it becomes attractive. There has developed a pretty strong habit ofrevulsion toward churches and all their sins over these past centuries. Plus,there’s the competition of scientism as a new mythology that is totally disjointfrom the churches and attractive because of the power of its weapons.Rupert: One of the big emotional plusses of scientism for people is its sense ofsuperiority. I converted to scientism at about age fourteen. A bit like you,Ralph, I looked around at everybody else praying or appearing to pray andimagined I was seeing from a higher point of view in which all this wassuperstition. Modern people feel superior to the part of religion that seemsinfantile and part of the past. However, a collapse of faith in scientism ishappening all around us; a widespread public disillusionment with science hasbeen developing.Ralph: People are left stranded, having rejected the church in favor of scienceand having rejected science in favor of nothing. This is the dilemma of today.Terence: Science and green politics can be sacralized through the psychedelicexperience. The psychedelic person knows that the scientist dismissing peoplebowed in prayer is a poor fool. A green party that uses a mystical language, apsychedelic language, a language of integration with nature and emotion wouldhave tremendous appeal. That’s why Rupert is so keen on the ayahuasca cults ofBrazil, because on one level they seek to preserve the rain forest and help outlittle people, but on another level they offer a psychedelic religion that makesclaims on the imagination, the heart, and the world soul.Ralph: How about celebrating the Eleusinian mysteries in the Cathedral of SaintJohn the Divine, or something of that scale?Terence: It has to be understood that psychedelics are a way to the Gaian mind.They are not metaphors for sacraments, they are real sacraments, and theirefficaciousness can have political consequences. A mystical political movementwould become a crusade or a jihad. The energy of the attractor is so great inthe mystical dimension that it creates a situation in which saving the Earth isnot something we argue about, it’s something we go out and do, like recoveringJerusalem for the pope.Ralph: We had a big start in the sixties toward this kind of psychedelic/greenrevolution. It failed for different reasons. For simplicity, I’ll suppose thatthe failure of the hippie subculture was due to its repression.Terence: It had no program, that’s all. The only program was to end the war.Ralph: But there were festivals, cults, and rituals that were changed to suitthe locale, the sacrament, and sacred music. A lot of things we’re talking aboutwere actually happening in the sixties. But there was great and successfulopposition to the program we’re now envisioning. What about the desire of thecurrent system to maintain itself by opposing the evolution of a greenpsychedelic revolution?Terence: I think the battle is already won. No one can oppose the crusade tosave the Earth; they can only quibble with its methods or style or rhetoric. Noone can stand up and say, “I’m against saving the Earth:”Ralph: Lip service is not enough. People have to act collectively and accordingto a strategy that has a possibility of success.Terence: If your enemies give lip service to your ideals, it’s a signal that youare in the top position. Everybody’s trying to out-green everybody else.Ralph: The Earth’s environment is a huge system, and it’s not enough to recycleplastic bottles. It’s not enough to stop cutting down the Amazon jungle. Thesethings only earn a slight extension of the time available to evolve a betterstrategy for things like the population explosion and the exhaustion of ourresources.Terence: If Gaia is on our side, what fears do we need to entertain?Ralph: The magnitude of the problem guarantees a response.Rupert: The green movement, if it’s to be effective, must have a spiritual andmystical dimension. How does it acquire one without either allying itself to agreen form of Christianity and Judaism or inventing its own kind of priestess orpriest cult and carrying out its own rituals?Ralph: There’s a time-scale problem. The environmental crisis is coming upon uswith the speed of a tidal wave. In the long run, it will be compared to theFlood of Noah. People had better get moving in the revitalized green churchmovement if they want to be on the bandwagon at all.Terence: The people who can lead the psychedelicized green movement have beentraining themselves for years without understanding what they have been trainingfor. Called upon to do so, they will step forward.Rupert: There would be an ecumenical psychedelic green order. The Christiangreens would link up with the green order of Judaism because they would have towork closely together.Ralph: There need to be green mystical orders associated with every religion.They would serve as a kind of neural network connecting all of these diversesystems into a new unity.Rupert: There’d be green orders of Islam, green orders of Hinduism …Ralph: … and Neosufism and Neokabbalah and …Rupert: The green order in America would have as one of its roles helping peoplereconnect with sacred places in America and honor them through appropriateceremonies. The green order in England would have the role of connecting peoplewith England’s sacred places.Ralph: Just as organized religion needs revolution and reinterpretation, soscience also needs revolution and reinterpretation. The Gaia hypothesis and itsaccompanying paradigm shift in science are bringing together scientists ofdifferent specialties who have never spoken with each other before. Thisrepresents a major restructuring and synthesis of science.Terence: Science for the first time has the capacity to measure its own impacton the world. Science created all these problems and science is now revealingtheir magnitude as they bear down upon us.Ralph: The accommodation of a scientific view of history and archaeology by thechurch has to be matched by an equal resacralization of science.Terence: The purpose of science should be understanding, not only technique. Weneed to hold back while we assimilate what we know at our current level, notpush relentlessly deeper into the application of techniques. That is rape. Thatis violation.Ralph: The revitalization of the church and the revision of science are alreadyunderway. In order to nucleate the social transformation implied, there must bea nucleation site, a first exemplar of this coalition of church and science.From this nucleus, the transformation might spread outward in rapid diffusion,amplified by the media.Terence: A psychedelic green party.Rupert: The Pacific Northwest of America is one part of the world where there isan attempt to reintegrate green politics and psychedelic cults with the Judaicand Christian traditions. In Europe, lots of people use native psilocybinmushrooms, but I don’t know whether they’re used in a ceremonial setting. InAmerica, mushroom cults have developed under the influence of peyote circles andNative American traditions of the sacramental use of plants. I don’t think thereare any living, indigenous traditions of this type left in Europe.The modern ayahuasca cult originated in the Amazon when a Christian took thissubstance and had a vision of Mary, who appeared to him as our Lady of theForest. She was clad in green and revealed the outlines of the ritual use ofayahuasca—which the devotees call daime—as a communion. Such things are revealedrather than invented. They have to be channeled. If a mushroom cult were to growup in Britain, it would have to happen spontaneously through prayer andvisionary guidance.Terence: The Mexican mushroom religion does its rituals in a very logical way insmall circles at night, with intentionality. There’s song, there’s prayer, andthere’s silence.Rupert: It’s very easy to conceive of such rituals. But to have authenticity forthose who participate in them, they have to be revealed rather than invented.Terence: They are psychedelic experiences. Their authenticity comes fromthemselves. We’re not talking about reciting mantras. This is the real thing.Rupert: Such ceremonies would need to be rooted in the spirit of the place wherethey occurred, and there would have to be appropriate intention and ritualelements to make them part of a larger movement such as the green order.Psychedelic groups would be the visionary branch of a larger green movement.Terence: I’m proposing in my book Food of the Gods that the mushroom was themidwife of humanity and that all human beings in all times and places canactually claim it as their heritage.Ralph: The ritual use of mushrooms would have been a gigantic chreode. It wouldbe possible to excavate it at any time, anywhere.Terence: Use of psychedelic mushrooms was the religion of human beings in Africafor the first million years. It underwent a retraction ten thousand years agoand broke up as recently as seven or eight thousand years ago when theprogressive desertification of the Sahara changed it from a vast grassland intothe formidable desert that exists today. The archaic revival seeks culturalrestoration of this lost symbiotic partner. It isn’t ultimately a matter of thepsychedelic experience per se: psilocybin has some unique relationship to theevolution of the human nervous system. In fact, it turns the human nervoussystem into an antenna for the Gaian mind, assisting people to behaveappropriately in the same way that termites behave appropriately within themorphogenetic field of their termite nest. If this antenna is not present inhuman beings, then human beings have to think up their own program, and it’susually power crazed, lethal, shortsighted, and grabby.Rupert: If this is the case, is your impression of people belonging to mushroomcults that they are of an entirely different quality from those who don’t belongto such groups? Do they behave appropriately and in tune with the Gaian mind?Terence: They tend to be rural. They tend to live communally. They tend to benonmotivated in the economic realm. In other words, they live simply. Voluntarysimplicity is a concept they’re very familiar with. They love and value theirchildren. They exemplify the values that peasantry has always exemplifiedbecause they live near the land. They want for nothing, but they have verylittle. This is my impression.Ralph: Do they have a plan to take over the Christian churches?Terence: No, they are beyond this. They are in the thrall of their religiousrelationship to the mushroom.Ralph: They may be absorbed by this political program sooner or later, as theacid rain destroys their mushrooms.Terence: My audiences until very recently preferred me to dwell on the mystical,the transhistorical. About a year and a half ago, people started questioning whythere was no political content to my talks. Now they demand political content.We may imagine, because we’re intellectuals and because we deal with this data,that Gaian politics is more on our minds than on the mind of the average person,but the housewife doing her ironing and the schoolchild on the bus both worryabout the fate of the Earth. The collective information field has shifted itsattention. The only competition for this focus on the need to save the Earth isthe stupid anti-drug hysteria. It’s an issue of how we relate to the vegetablematrix.Rupert: The psychedelic order is only one aspect of the resacralization program.Another aspect is the revival of pilgrimage and the sense of sacred time. Thesecan be incorporated easily into many contexts of people’s lives. The reasonpilgrims and tourists go to sacred places is that some quality of the place isspecial. Rather than visiting just for historical or archaeological reasons,people can relate to the quality of a place consciously, asking the spirit ofthe place to inform and illuminate them on their visit and to give them itsblessing. I think most people go to sacred places or into the wilderness becauseof a desire to make some such connection. This is part of the romantic, private,subjective tradition of our culture. It may be fairly easy to resacralizetourism. Through the impetus of the green movement, the revival of pilgrimagecould spread very rapidly.Ralph: I think we’ve arrived at a vision characterized by surprising optimismabout the outcome of this crisis. This vision incorporates the successful escapefrom the downward spiral via the green movement, resacralization, andpsychedelic orders. We’re talking about going up the down staircase, and the waythis has emerged in our trialogue, it sounds fairly plausible, possible, andunderway. Perhaps it’ll be the responsibility of the sacred artist to providethe links between politics, theology, and practical action.Terence: Maybe what we need is a conference linking green politics and thepsychedelic dimension. People who have thought a lot about green politics butnot at all or mostly negatively about transformational options would have achance to discuss these options.Ralph: It would be a conference of synergy between the new politics and the newreligion.Rupert: I don’t think you want a conference. I think what you want is asacrament.Terence: A pilgrimage and a sacrament."},{"pageContent":"image [images/f0140-01.jpg]I think it is of primary importance to recognize consciously that education is aform of initiation….

Every society orcivilization has an educational system of some kind. What would the educationalsystem in the new world order look like?I think it is of primary importance to recognize consciously that education is aform of initiation. Even in the present system, we have a training period andthen we pass through a time of testing or trial. Some of us fail, others pass,and the passed ones become the initiates. At every level we have examinations,and each level of initiation is accompanied by impressive public graduationceremonies. In this realm, the medieval hierarchy lives on, complete with robes,B.A., M.A., Ph.D., and so on. The initiates are like a secular priesthoodqualified to run and order society. From their ranks are drawn our bureaucrats,scientists, technocrats, and intellectuals.With certification of higher levels of education, people get better jobs, betteremployment opportunities, and more respect. For this reason, to the despair ofeducators throughout the world, most students passing through universities seemto have more interest in receiving degrees than real interest in the subjectsthey’re studying. In the Third World, a B.A. or an M.A. changes a person’sentire social status. In India, a person’s marriage prospects and the size ofdowry they can command depend on their degree.In fact, modern education involves an initiation into the rationalist orhumanist worldview. It elevates the intellect to a disembodied point of view inwhich everything is seen as if from the outside. Its slogan is objectivity. Whenschool children are taught literature within this framework, the teacher doesnot read them great poems accompanied by the beating of a drum and the bringingin of magic and the realm of myth. Instead, the teacher tells them, “This poemwas written by so-and-so who was born in so-and-so and influenced by so-and-so.”Students learn facts about the poems rather than the poems themselves. Thiseducation system makes the supreme arbiter a kind of emotionless, detached,disembodied mind working through the medium of written language. It testsstudents solely in the written rather than the spoken mode.The first step in this system is literacy. People must read and write so theycan know what’s in reports, official documents, newspapers, and books. Thisbecomes more important than what they actually feel or experience. The greatlibraries are like temples, containing much more than any one of us could everread or know about. The deeper one’s initiation into the priesthood of thewritten word, the less the realm of personal experience counts foranything—except in the realm of private life, behind the diaphragm thatseparates the private person from the educated public persona.An alternative educational model would still be based on initiation, but abroader kind not confined to the intellectual realm. Throughout the world,people realize that being initiated means taking on a new social role, andusually these roles are in some sense sacralized. There are guilds and castes ofcraftsmen—in India, the potter caste, the weaver caste, the priest caste, and soon—with their own traditions and skills passed from parents to children.Children are generally initiated into the skills of their parents. In oursociety, for example, most adults want to be initiated into the club ofqualified drivers. They go through a learning period and pass a test, and then anew freedom opens up. There is real power with a magnetic pull and glamor to it.There are also initiations into skills like swimming and football, trades likeplumbing, and the various professions.Much of the present educational system could be transformed if we consciouslyrecognized its initiatory quality. For example, medical students, in order tobecome doctors, are required to dissect a human corpse. To overcome theirinstinctive, deep-down revulsion to the array of dead bodies, as well astraditional taboos against interfering with corpses, students first entering thedissecting room presently adopt a highly detached and usually jocular attitude.In the new system, medical students would still dissect a human body, but theywould prepare themselves with a meditation on death. As in some Tantrictraditions where practitioners spend a night alone in a graveyard, this wouldmake explicit the initiatory quality of the solemn moment of confronting death.Other trades and professions would have comparable initiatory elements. Computermodeling, for example, would be an important part of the initiation intomathematics. This would introduce the initiate to the mathematical landscape,which mathematicians don’t talk much about. Rather than pretending thatmathematics is only a rational system of numbers and symbols, the initiate wouldbe exposed to the vivid visual imagination, which is where creativemathematicians realize the magic is.Included in the new educational system would be rites of passage at puberty.These could happen at new-style summer camps where there would be a programinvolving a vision quest, for example, with at least twenty-four hours spentalone in the wilderness. Such camps already exist in places like northernVancouver Island, mostly for Native American youth.One kind of system that already has this initiatory quality is the workshopsystem. This is at present the principal model for an alternative educationalsystem that could replace the present one. Workshops make the dynamics of peopleinteracting as a group explicit, and they are based on learning throughexperience. They attract people who actually want to learn something withothers, find some new insight, or make some new transition.Terence: You put your finger on the fact that the initiatory ritual is thecontinuing thread from the archaic that can lead us into the future. The onlything I would add is that the education of the future should have a tremendousfocus on history. The educational system currently in place has as its paradigmthe teaching of physics—in other words, the conveying of an extremely abstract,mathematically based description of nature that leads to high engineeringcompetence. In an ideal educational milieu, the science of archaeology mightreplace the science of physics as the place where the focus is put. With therevolution in data recovery ability that has occurred in archaeology in the lastten years, a kind of telescope into the past is being erected by the worldarchaeology community. To teach this in our schools would release us from thepost-industrial notion of history as a kind of trendless fluctuation or classstruggle or some other very dreary model of the human journey through time.We’ve fallen into a sort of historical amnesia that has blunted the acuity ofour political decision making. In reformed education, people must be taught thathistory is a system of interlocking resonances in which we are all imbedded. Wemust teach our children that they are going to be called upon to make decisionsthat will affect the state of life on this planet millennia in the future.Without some knowledge of history from the birth of the universe down toyesterday’s headlines, we’re not in a position to act in our own best interest.I define education broadly as the inculcation of attitudes that cause us to actgenerally in the interest of all.Ralph: The workshop mode would be valuable to diffuse the curriculum with newdimensions of history, archaeology, and the revisioning of the past. There couldbe a different teacher every year, rather than a professor with tenure.We’ve focused on higher education, and maybe when higher education istransformed, it will somehow change the whole educational system. I feel,however, that we haven’t really addressed the main problems in the currentsystem. The trouble is, we don’t know exactly what they are.Infusing the current educational system with a new spirit probably will not besufficient. Who will be organizing all of this? Where is the department ofadministration, the administration building? Who’s deciding which workshops willbe offered, which teacher will conduct them, and so on? Will there be a newemphasis on a feminist revision of history? Will there be new interpretations ofdata from archaeology? Somebody must decide, whether it’s the PTA or whatever,how many people are going to school. Everyone? A few? Those who wish? Whatrewards will be offered? These things are the nuts and bolts of running a schoolsystem. As the system evolves, or devolves, the path must be determined and putin place at the beginning.In the current initiation system, there are two different processes: theinitiation process and the accreditation process. This means that there isinstruction and then there is a test. As a teacher, I’ve always hated thetesting aspect. I am happy to teach people who want to learn from me. That is arole I can accept. Nevertheless, I must also write letters of recommendation ordeclare that a student has reached a certain level. Usually, I don’t even knowwhat level—using the grades of A, B, C, or whatever—the student has reached, andwhatever I once thought the dividing line between the grades was, I’m no longersure. I like the initiating and I don’t like the testing. Yet if there is notesting, the educational system fails in its mission.Spiritual, moral, and social values are consistent with initiation but not withtesting. One of the things society asks education to do is produce peoplequalified for trades and professions. I think the heart of a school system’scurriculum should transcend the trades, the professions, the basic skills. Whereis the spiritual initiation? Where are the moral and ethical values? Where isthe fabric of society, as it were? Where is this to be taught, if not in theschools? Did Plato’s Academy have a final exam on Socrates’ Philosophy 101?Perhaps, in a new system, there would be a spiritual elite and professors ofmoral philosophy. Plato and Socrates would lead a workshop, or something likethat. The administrators arranging the plumbing workshops and those arrangingthe spiritual workshops would be people with different qualifications.Another thing that has crippled the modern university is the isolation of thespecialties. Besides having workshops with one leader, we must have trialogueworkshops to give the interplay of different specialties due time. I don’tpropose, as some have, that we completely replace courses in specialties withinterdisciplinary courses. I think we need a partnership, like Mother Earth andFather Sky. There should be time for the specialties and equal time for thesyncretists to free associate, to relate the subject matter of the entireeducational experience to the progress and future of society and to theevolutionary challenges facing each generation.The educational system of the new world order also needs the participation ofthe community in the determination of the curriculum. It needs to resistevolution that’s too fast while not being too rigid to change. It needs toinvolve a partnership of the special and the general. It needs to relate tolife, not only in terms of fixing the faucets but in terms of making everydaymoral decisions about altruism and selflessness and synergy.Rupert: Obviously, the element lacking in what I’ve proposed is the spiritualdimension. I took for granted, based on the present system, that the educationalsystem is essentially secular. If we think of a spiritually based system,there’s a completely different realm of possibilities. Our problem is that ifthe education system were Christian, then Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, andatheists would object. This is why secularism is an important feature of modernpolitical ideology and why spiritual traditions and practices have no place inschools. The secular state by its very nature is desacralized. It’s a humanistconcept.For an entire society to have a spiritual dimension, one would need officialstate rituals like they have in Japan with the emperor and the Shinto religionand in Britain with the monarchy and the established church. The American modelis entirely desacralized.In America, the system would have to be a free-for-all. It would work somethinglike this: Each student at age eighteen would be given books of fifty-five or soworkshop vouchers, and the student would have to take fifty-five workshops overthe next three years in order to become an initiated adult. There would have tobe a minimum number taken in specific areas, like group dynamics, myths,history, philosophy, natural history, ecology, morality, and religion. Tofacilitate choice and logistics, there would be a computerized catalog of allthe relevant programs offered at all recognized workshop centers.Ralph: The graduating credential on finishing the use of the fifty-five voucherswould be the list of workshops completed at the point of initiation.Rupert: The whole process would start with a ceremonial induction into thepathway. Each workshop would itself have an initiatory pattern. The whole thingwould culminate in some final test involving not only intellectual and practicalskills but skills in groups as well. The final ceremony could also involve, asthe Eleusinian mysteries, a psychedelic initiation, perhaps with mushrooms.Terence: This would be the archaic return: a culmination of the educationalprocess and the archaic mystery. Such ceremonies and sacraments were theoriginal source of community. This concept follows very firmly in the steps ofAldous Huxley. In his last work, Island, he suggested annual ritualizedencounters with psilocybin in a context of other radical forms of physical andmental therapy as a basis for a new form of education. As we reinvent Eleusis,we truly reinvent the wheel.Ralph: This educational concept is actually a covert plan for the introductionof a new world religion through the religious aspects of initiation—and perhapsthrough visits to sacred sites. In the absence of an actual schoolhouse, therewould be workshop centers all over the map. Workshops in religion, ethics, andso on would correspond to different established traditions as well as extinct,ancient traditions.Rupert: These workshops would be led by people from all traditions: RomanCatholic, Methodist, Islamic, Hindu, Tibetan Buddhist, and so on. If studentswanted to know about Judaism, they wouldn’t go to a professor of comparativereligion, they would go to a workshop with a rabbi.Ralph: The relationship between education and the job market would be clear inthe classified ads: “Must have three W courses, two E courses, and one Scourse.” As requirements of different industries become known, people seeking aparticular profession would see to it that they took courses in the requiredsubject areas.Rupert: This system could fulfill the needs of employers better than the presentone.Ralph: This vision becomes more satisfactory and plausible. What about the paththat goes from here to there? How can we get rid of the entrenched system? Thevoters would have to have a plebiscite in order to vote on the opportunity tohave a voucher system in the schools.Rupert: The system can simply be privatized. Vouchers would be valid at schoolson an approved list drawn up by a new kind of educational board. The systemwould be pluralistic and extremely responsive to what people actually want andwhat students and parents are actually interested in. It would be decentralizedand self-regulating.Terence: This is school as business. Do we really want a marketplace of ideas?Rupert: It would be run not for profit, but through charitable trusts.We also need to consider the reform of existing professions. Each branch of thepresent educational system already exists as a kind of guild of mathematiciansor biochemists or engineers with its own founding fathers, honored traditions,and so on. Each of these guilds needs to develop from within itself a vision ofitself in the new world order. Groups of doctors or astronomers or geologistscould get together in workshop gatherings in places like Esalen to discuss theiroriginal vision in becoming doctors. They would ask questions such as: Whatinspired us to study medicine? What is our present experience of the profession?What are the main limitations? What would a new vision of the healing professionbe like? What could astronomy be for people today? How can the geologicprofession reconnect with its patroness, Mother Earth?Ralph: Even when the plebiscite is put on the ballot and passed, and whenstudents are issued vouchers and the new structure simply begins, most teacherswill still be ignorant of the meaning of ancient sites, the significance ofstars, and the new vision of healing. Chances are they would continue teachingexactly as they teach today. While the new schools envision a new curriculum,the workshops would keep on teaching the old one.What kind of miracle would get the whole system onto a new track? Particularly,how could the resacralization aspect that we are longing for ever happen?Rupert: You wouldn’t just get a booklet of vouchers through the mail. When youstart on your path, you would be entering a kind of apprenticeship. There wouldbe an induction ceremony, which could be Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, orsecular. There would be plenty of scope for free enterprise in this area. You’dgo through one of these ceremonies, calling in blessings on your journey. You’dget your book of vouchers as part of the ceremony. All of this would take placeat a sacred place of your choosing.Ralph: Setting up a system of initiation rites would be the key step forswitching the whole system over.Rupert: This may become fairly easy as the importance of initiations and ritesof passage for personal development becomes widely recognized.Ralph: What about the five million young Americans who come of age for theirfirst initiation this coming fall? Exactly how do we accommodate this number ofstudents and produce thousands of new teachers to teach a quarter millionworkshops in a year?Rupert: Instead of an overnight change in the entire American system, I’mthinking of a pioneering experiment in a limited area.Ralph: And it may slowly grow if it deserves to.Rupert: Things happen organically in society. We can’t convert a system withoutsome example of an alternative that actually works.Terence: We need some concrete proof of concept demonstration.Rupert: The workshop system is already up and running as a concrete alternative.It exists in a pluralistic, free-market form, and it is self-sustaining. Peoplego to workshops because they want to. Unfortunately, at present practically noone under thirty goes to workshops. It’s a system of education entirely for themiddle-aged.Ralph: What would be necessary to attract an eighteen-year-old to a workshop?Rupert: The fact is, a lot of teenagers don’t know that this world of workshopsexists. If they came to Esalen, for example, on an initiatory program, theywould be initiated into an adult world, and new possibilities would open up tothem.Obviously, there would need to be a whole new breed of workshop leaders.Existing workshop centers would take on the new role of creating workshops totrain and initiate workshop leaders.Ralph: Somehow, standards would have to be maintained. It would have to be morethan the popularity of a given workshop that guaranteed its continuousexistence. Given the corruption that’s a known mechanism in the downward spiralof societies, worse and worse workshops would become more and more popularbecause they would offer the valuation, the accreditation, and the initiationwithout the student actually doing anything other than sitting in a hot bath andmeditating.Terence: What you’re implying is what you seek to avoid: a second overseeingentity that tests the workshop graduate.Ralph: It could be that industries wouldn’t employ somebody just for havinggraduated. They would insist on a prospective employee having gone to workshopsfrom some of their favorite teachers or institutions. A bachelor’s degree fromEsalen could be worth more than a bachelor’s degree from Stanford.Terence: Corporations could post a list of courses that would enhance people’slikelihood of being hired by them. Then students could choose for themselveswhich ones they would include as they formed their curriculum.Ralph: This would be an intrinsic, self-organizational model. Maybe thecorporations could just do their own testing.Rupert: This could start right away on a limited scale. Scholarships could beoffered for, say, five workshop vouchers, with beginning and ending ceremoniesfor the whole thing. College students could do the workshops during theirvacations. When they return to their college, they could tell their friends, whomight then want to be initiated themselves. This would begin to establish aparallel system of education operating alongside the present one. If it becomesa sufficiently powerful attractor, it would have an enormous impact on schoolsand colleges. The traditional system’s faults would become more and moreapparent, because more and more people within it would have another take on whateducation could be like. Sooner or later, colleges would start offeringworkshop-type education themselves and eventually convert to the initiatorymodel.Ralph: Present colleges could be persuaded to offer transfer credit for a set offive workshops in this program. Five workshops would count as one course. Itwould be like taking an extension course or a work/study program. In the summer,students could take workshops at five different workshop sites or just one, andthey would get a college credit for it.In sum, the new world system could actually begin with an educational program.We have to find a way to actually begin the pilot project. Since the adulteducation division is already functioning, we need to expand it into high schooland college divisions. A few people presently coming of age, perhaps children ofpeople who are already participants in adult workshops, could enthusiasticallyvolunteer to be the first students of the new system. As this attractor growsand evolves and self-organizes, a bifurcation point will be reached, at whichtime a popular referendum could pass legislation for the fifty-coupon books.Existing universities and professional schools would then begin to acceptworkshops for transfer credit.This system has to begin in an existing workshop center. Possibly it could behere at Esalen, since we’re here dreaming this up. Assuming that corruptiondoesn’t somehow annihilate the system as soon as it starts, it’s a devious wayof achieving the resacralization of the world."},{"pageContent":"image [images/f0154-01.jpg]When encountered outside the religious framework, the apocalyptic expectation ofimminent transformation of the environment—with the individual somehow playing acentral role—is labeled pathology.

This seems to be not only the theme of the crisis inthe present moment but the unique unifying thread throughout Western religion.More insistently than all other religious systems on Earth, the Western systemsinsist on appointing an end to their world. The cyclical worlds of Hinduism arecycles of time so vast that they lose all force on the popular imagination. Whatuniquely distinguishes Judaism, Christianity, and Islam is the insistence thatGod will appear tangential to history in a way that will create a last-daysscenario. This scenario will involve a great uptaking of souls into the mysteryof God. This idea, which is called “apocalyptic” in its more catastrophicversion and “millenarian” in its more pastoral version, is a necessarycorrelative to the concept of Eden and the unique moment of humanity’s creationby God. If human creation occurred at a unique moment in the history of theuniverse, then presumably, after the expiation of the sin of Eden, God willgather humans once again into the mystery.When encountered outside the religious framework, the apocalyptic expectation ofimminent transformation of the environment—with the individual somehow playing acentral role—is labeled pathology. This pathological symptom in individuals isthe driving force behind much of our civilization. Some years ago, the secretaryof the interior was asked why he wasn’t saving more of America’s forests. Hereplied that he saw no reason to save the forests since Jesus was coming and theend of the world was imminent.What is this intuition about the end of the world? Now that we’re beginning togather more data, science is beginning to pay back on promises made in theeighteenth century to give us a complete and deep description of the physicaland astronomical universe. What we’re seeing in this description is a highlychaotic domain. There isn’t a stable body in the Solar System that isn’t deeplypockmarked with asteroidal impact. From the inner planets to the moons of thegas giants there is tremendous visual evidence of catastrophic episodesthroughout the Solar System’s history.If God or a supertransmundane event were to enter the ordinary biological andevolutionary history of a planet, there might be some kind of shock wave ofanticipation, a sense of the disruption of ordinary events before the big eventwas in fact imminent. The brief period we’ve experienced of the past twentythousand years seems to be within such an aura of anticipation. If we couldstrip the provincialism from the messages of the apocalyptic religions, we wouldfind they have a deep intuition about the inherent instability of the cosmos. Ithink they are trying to extract something out of the human future that may infact involve the survival of the planet. Shamans and mystics and psychedelictravelers may be getting a very noisy, low-grade signal about a future eventthat is somehow built into the structure of space and time.Perhaps we are somehow witnesses to a major phase transition in the career ofself-reflecting Bios in the universe. It may not be the end of the world but acomplete systemic reorganization on the scale of the metamorphosis that occursin butterflies: a complete meltdown of the previous world system and then arecasting at the behest of a higher, Gaian mind or the world soul.Life has a terrifying tenaciousness. It seized hold of this planet 3.5 billionyears ago and has managed it through hellfire. It has again and again broughtthe planet into stable equilibria supportive of biology. There have beenasteroid infalls and continents ground to dust, and still, life has kept hold ofits chunk of ground. Perhaps the recent advent of human intelligence signals acrisis of greater magnitude. The presence of our minds may indicate that we arevery near some sort of enormous concrescing singularity.We are experiencing more than calendrical pressure from the approach of thethird millennium. Concrescence appears in graphs of resources and populationdensity and demand for hydroelectric energy and levels of strontium 90 in milk.Who can look at all this data and not see either the yawning grave of humanityor a complete system reversal? I think we’re standing on the cusp of ahyperdimensional event of some sort toward which all of history is being pouredat a great rate. It’s seeping into our religions, our politics, our dreams, andinto the general imagination. We have the peculiar good fortune of fulfillingthe wish conveyed in the Irish toast “May you be alive at the end of the world.”Ralph: It seems logical that if there was a Big Bang at the beginning, thenthere will be a Big Bang at the end. The Creation story in Genesis and thepreceding myths somehow imply this.Terence: In the Revelation of Saint John the Divine, this is laid out. Angelscome and pour down diseases. There are plagues of scorpionlike creatures thatcome from the interior of the Earth. At the end, the twelve-gated city, the newJerusalem, comes down like a flying saucer covered with jewels. It is God’skingdom coming to Earth to receive the elect as the oceans boil away and thedamned are dragged into hell for eternity. This is a completely bizarreproduction that is one of the most puzzling pieces of literature in theChristian canon. People who immediately followed Christ expected it within theirlifetime. There was a 120-year period when no one got seriously organizedbecause everybody was standing around waiting for the end of the world. “Amen,Amen, I say unto you, this generation shall not pass away until these things areaccomplished.”After about a century of this, people like Origen and Eusebius came forward andsaid, “Listen, enough of this waiting for the end of the world. We have to getthe scene organized and get our hands on some real estate.”Ralph: I would think that the force of the prophecy has declined.Terence: There are fundamentalist cults in the United States, whose adherentsnumber in the tens of millions, that believe the scenario of Revelation is beingplayed out on the front pages of the newspaper. The most extreme position holdsthat the apocalypse occurred in 1847 and that we are now living in themillennium. Then there are those who locate the date in the near future, aroundthe year 2000 and the turning of the century. In millenarian speculation, peoplewho discover the key invariably find the millenarian date to be just a few yearsahead of their own time period.However, if we’re trying to count all the adherents to the apocalypse theory,then we have to count all the folks into scientism with their greenhouseeffects, ozone holes, CFCs, and acid rain. They, too, preach apocalypse.Rupert: We’ve had the end-of-the-world scenario of nuclear holocaust hangingover us for decades.Ralph: It comes from the same culture. I just wonder how much credibility togive the Christian apocalyptic vision when less than half the human populationis involved with it. Does this mean that just half of the planet would bevaporized while the other half would keep on going?Terence: All of these scenarios may be metaphors for something really weird thatwe are in a much better position to anticipate than John the Divine of Patmoswas. In one of the scenarios I’ve imagined, time travel will be discovered andhistory will end, suddenly—just bang. People beyond that point will look back atus the way we look at the Anasazi and talk about how people used to live inlinear time: all that waiting for stuff to happen in a strange jelly ofstiffened dimensionality. To people born into a time-traveling world, theprevious mode of existence will be mere rumor. When they are in the future, theywill be able to travel back into the past, but no further than the discovery ofthe first time machine. Before that moment there were no time machines, and theycan’t take a time machine into a universe where time machines don’t exist.Imagine that it’s December 22, 2012, at the La Chorrera World Temporal MechanicsInstitute. The countdown is in progress and the temponaut has been strapped intothe time machine. A technician pushes the button and she sails off into thefuture. The interesting question is, What happens in the next moment?Ralph: Millions of people arrive from a more populated part of the universe.Terence: Yes. Millions of time machines arrive from all possible parts of thefuture. This historic moment is as far back as people can go in their timemachines. They will say to each other, “Have you been to the edge? Have you beenback and seen the Abraham machine take off?”At this point, in considering this matter of time travel, I had a seriousdelusional breakthrough: I realized that, when the temponaut goes off into thefuture, suddenly all of the future will undergo some kind of collapse andeverything will happen instantly. On Earth today, the more advanced culturestend to influence, and finally to dominate, the less advanced cultures. This issimilar to the equalization of pressure inside a closed chamber of gases. In thesame way that gases confined in a space equalize pressure to a uniform value,cultures tend to take on some of the characteristics of the most advancedcultural level with which they are in contact. This happens whether the culturesin question are confined to a single planet and a single historical epoch or areconfined within a temporal domain defined by the limits of a time-travelingtechnology.The most advanced state of human accomplishment, even if it is billions of yearsin the future and absolutely beyond our ability to imagine, will appear onemillisecond after the temponaut takes off, on the other side of the timethreshold. This technology takes the entire future history of the universe, upuntil its conclusion, and compresses it down into the next few milliseconds. Wewill then be face to face with the end purpose of all evolution, all process,all pattern, all energy, space, time, and matter.This is a complete fulfillment of the monotheistic intuition about theapocalypse. It is as though the universe is a huge conundrum, and we’re in theresuffering through a long strange trip. There’s science and religion and magic,and we’re fumbling and fumbling slowly toward something. It turns out to be thealchemical gold, and when we clasp it to ourselves, time ends, space ends,matter ends, and everything ends. We go into the conclusion, the payoff, thejackpot. We go over the cusp and meet the management.Ralph: Probably, this hasn’t happened yet.Terence: No. It will occur in A.D. 2012. At least that’s the implication I drawfrom my work with the fractal wave that was so carefully built into the I Chingby the pre-Chou Chinese. There is very good agreement between this wave andrecorded historical data, but only if we make two assumptions. One is that thewave maps the ingression of novelty, or complexity, into three-dimensionalspace/time. The second assumption is that the wave’s terminus is late in A.D.2012. With these assumptions in place, there is a very neat formal mapping forthe most difficult of all phenomena to model: human history itself. The factthat the Mayan calendar ends on the same date gives me some measure ofconfidence.Ralph: There are alternatives in the interpretation of this date. I think thatthis particular time-travel fantasy of yours is actually a syncretism betweenapocalyptic paranoia and the time wave.Terence: It isn’t necessary to associate apocalypse with the date. The fact thatthe wave fits so well with all this millenarian and apocalyptic pressure at theturn of the millennium seems pretty suggestive to me. The Mayan calculations areanother coincidence. The Maya and the Christians are within twelve years of eachother if we take the year 2000 as the turn of the eon. This is the slipperyrealm of human judgment and data evaluation.Ralph: Ruth Benedict studied sixty different cultures, charting them out bydifferent parameters and finally sorting them into three bins: the Apollonian,the Dionysian, and the Paranoid. It just may be that a Paranoid culture having areligion with a paranoid element, contributed by Saint John the Divine, happensto develop extraordinary technical powers that are great generators of lethaltoxicity.Terence: The word paranoid is designed to make people not like it. If somethinghas this label, nobody will seriously look into it. There is an implicitassumption that there’s nothing to be paranoid about. In fact, in a very dynamicand unsteady universe, paranoia may well be a true sensitivity to the facts ofthe matter.Ralph: Paranoids always say that. I know there are fundamentalist Christiansaround who take every word of the Bible very seriously and literally. However,as far as I’m concerned, the Bible is somebody’s paranoid fantasy put down in abook. I certainly don’t believe that it’s a divine document with any specialcredibility. Some people have taken this book very seriously, so now they’reparanoid too.I’m ready to admit that there are a number of coincidences about this year 2012and that some of them are ominous. But I’m still not giving any credibility toSaint John the Divine. From the morphogenetic-field point of view, there arequite a number of people believing in Saint John the Divine. That we have totake seriously.Terence: He felt a quaking in the force. Today we have much better techniquesthan Saint John the Divine to figure out what this quaking in the force is.Ralph: Much more likely than any of these things we’ve discussed is the factthat we’re facing a serious ecological crisis and evolutionary challenge ofunprecedented magnitude. James Lovelock has said that the present rate ofspecies extinction is one of the eight largest catastrophes in the planet’slifetime.Terence: If we don’t have a miracle every day, we’re not going to make it.That’s why we don’t need Saint John the Divine to tell us there’s an apocalypseunderway.Ralph: Every prophecy with any credibility says to me that there is some way tomake it through. I have to admit I’m extremely doubtful of the intelligence ofthis human species to find it.Terence: It depends on what’s causing the problem. If you think humans are theproblem …Ralph: Humans are the problem.Terence: All parameters of planetary stability become more and more unstable astime approaches the present. What about the sudden appearance of large andrepeated glaciations in the last five million years? Glaciers are new in thelife of the Earth and may indicate that something is wrong with the sun or thegeodynamics of the planet. Maybe humans are the problem. Or maybe human beingsare the answer.Ralph: The Earth could jump off its orbit at any moment and head out to space,but it seems to me that ecological catastrophe is a more appropriate form ofapocalyptic vision at the present time.Rupert: There’s a sense in which the apocalyptic scenario we find ourselves inis a product of the apocalyptic myth throughout history. It’s a self-fulfillingprophecy. The apocalyptic tendency in Christianity inspired millenarianmovements throughout the ages, including that of the Pilgrim fathers, who cameto a new world in America—the promised land. It inspired Francis Bacon’s visionof unlimited progress through science and technology and the conquest of nature.His millenarian goal was a technological utopia, a new Eden of peace,prosperity, and wise scientist-priest figures running everything, a promisedland flowing with milk and honey and material abundance brought about throughthe scientific control of nature. This scenario underlies the ideology ofprogress and is now bringing about ecological catastrophe.The myth of Faustian science is related to this apocalyptic model. In thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Faust sold his soul to the devil in returnfor unlimited knowledge and power for a fixed period—twenty-four years—afterwhich he was damned and dragged down to hell. The modern form of the Faust mythis Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein story, in which the scientist is not destroyed bysupernatural powers but by his own creation. It’s obvious that the nuclearthreat has a Frankenstein quality to it, and the ecological crisis also has thisapocalyptic mythic basis.Ralph: For this reason, we have to do surgery on the self-fulfillingmythological mechanism working in history. One good start would be areinterpretation of the Revelation of Saint John the Divine.Terence: We need to switch the vision onto another track.Rupert: The Revelation of Saint John the Divine is not a unique phenomenon inthe Judeo-Christian tradition. Around the time of Christ, many people believedthe end was at hand. In this sense, it was a period very similar to our own. TheBook of Daniel in the Old Testament is an apocalyptic, prophetic book and is aprecursor of the Revelation of Saint John the Divine. These are just twoexamples in a large and extensive literature.An apocalyptic spirit pervades the teachings of Jesus. Indeed, it runs throughthe entire Bible. God promises Abraham that he will take him and his descendantsto another land where wonderful things will happen and his children shall be asthe sands of the sea and he shall be the father of many nations. Through faithin such promises, history has been made. Faith allowed Moses to lead the peopleof God out of Egypt into the Promised Land.In such stories, there is a fundamental sense of being on a journey toward somewonderful destiny in the future. This journey can be to a different place, likeAmerica for the Pilgrim fathers. It can also be a journey through history to afuture millennium, to a new age. This is the faith that underlies the attempt totransform the world through science and technology. It’s a pattern so deeplyrooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition, so fundamental to the entire historicalorientation of our religion and culture, that mere tampering with the book ofRevelation won’t make it go away.Terence: How do we direct history toward a nonlethal yet satisfying conclusion?Perhaps history isn’t simply a lethal neurosis. Perhaps it’s an actualanticipation of what has been made inevitable by all this technology.Ralph: You are suggesting that we just get used to the apocalypse happening.Rupert: We’ve all got used to the fact it could happen at any time. Terence,your message recalls the saying of Jesus that the kingdom of heaven will comelike a thief in the night.Terence: “… like a thief in the night, and no man will know the moment of mycoming.”Ralph: Either there is an inevitable apocalypse on the horizon or one might becreated by a self-fulfilling mechanism of paranoid prophecy. To stop it, we mustdefuse the time bomb of the Bible.Terence: We should be allowed to let the apocalypse happen, rather than make ithappen, which is what we seem to be set on doing.Ralph: The story of the secretary of the interior is a direct example. For him,not only is it happening, but it’s happening so soon that we may as well killoff everything immediately for the fun of it.Terence: “Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed uponthe world…. What rough beast … Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?” This imagefrom William Butler Yeats haunts the twentieth century as strongly as it hauntedthe first and second centuries A.D. If culture is a fantasy arising from theunconscious, then we’ve certainly set ourselves up for the end. It’s going to bevery delicate to ride this through, understand it, stop it, back out of it, andintegrate it.Ralph: Is this one of our major weaknesses from the evolutionary point of view?Rupert: It’s what has enabled us to understand and discover the evolutionarypoint of view. The very notion of human progress is an apocalyptic vision ofhistory written large. This myth is not confined to churches and synagogues. Ourscientific worldview has grown up within the Judeo-Christian matrix with itsidea of a beginning, a middle, and an end. The idea of human progress waswidespread by the end of the eighteenth century, and the idea of biologicalprogress extended the same idea to all life, giving us the theory of evolution.Since the 1960s, the entire cosmos has been seen as evolutionary. I would saythat the Big Bang cosmology is an apocalyptic vision of history with anexplosive beginning implying an explosive or implosive end. Astronomy points toa more local apocalypse as well. The theory is that, sooner or later, maybe infive billion years, the sun, like any other star, will burn up its hydrogenfuel, get much hotter, expand, and then puff off its outer atmosphere, leaving awhite dwarf core. This will be the end of all life in the solar system. Thisscientific worldview is undoubtedly apocalyptic, but it puts the end in theremote future.Terence: Thus conveniently far away.Rupert: The mechanistic science of the nineteenth century also predicted thefinal heat death of the universe. This would be the ultimate triumph of entropyor chaos over order.Ralph: The apocalypse myth is an integral part of the historical concept of theIsraelites who invented it, and we believe we can’t do anything about it. Theparanoia of our culture is manifest in the assumption that the end is happeningtomorrow.Terence: This is more than paranoia. The Earth is on fire, haven’t you heard?Who else has nuclear stockpiles? Who else has Agent Orange? Who else has CFCsdissolving the ozone hole? We can interpret this as a slow apocalypse that takestwo hundred years or as a fast apocalypse that takes fifteen minutes and canhappen today or tomorrow. All these possibilities are real.Ralph: Your projection of apocalypse in the year 2012, I think, is actuallydamaging our chances of having a future.Terence: I think it’s a way to manage ourselves through a narrow neck in a stateof high awareness. We can use the calendar as a club, saying to our leaders, “Doyou want to enter the third millennium armed like barbarians? Or do you want todrape yourself in the mantle of peace and be the saviors of the world, theunifiers of mankind?” Everyone should thoroughly examine the premises of theirsociety as we approach the third millennium. For example, the approachingmillennium is putting tremendous pressure on governments to get rid of nuclearstockpiles by the year 2000.By the year 2012, the world population will be approaching ten billion people.Propagated at the present rate of fade, there will be no ozone layer. The impactof that single parameter is totally unknown. Then there are carbon dioxideemissions, acid rain, and nuclear proliferation and propaganda running rampant.Meanwhile, pharmacology, brainwashing, surgical reconstruction, and high-techundercover technologies of all sorts are making new leaps toward their owntwisted perfection. Under these conditions of cultural compression, forms ofnovelty will erupt that are totally unpredictable in the present context.Everything is knitting together. Our boundaries are dissolving into a kind oftechno-biological-informational soup. The intentionality behind all this is inthe hands of no one but the Gaian will.What is happening is like the metamorphosis that goes on inside a chrysalis.This planet is having its forests liquified, its oceans boiled, its populationsmoved, and its genes are streaming in all directions with exotic toxins mixedin. We’re in a time storm whose diameter is impossible to estimate. Thebarometric pressure is dropping faster than we’ve ever seen it drop. There’s aneerie stillness, and the light in the sky looks very strange, but nothingdefinite has happened yet.Rupert: A nuclear holocaust in which Christendom destroyed itself would be aself-fulfilling apocalypse. The environmental threat is much more global. As weshift the focus of our attention from the dangers of nuclear war and turn to theglobal problem, it is apparent that the Omega Point you are trying to describe,Terence, involves some kind of collective transition in human consciousness.This might be achieved without mass death through something you have vividlyportrayed as a kind of collective hallucinogenic experience.Terence: Every human life becomes ultimately an approach to this question offinal time. If we don’t live in the age of the world’s end, that doesn’t mean wedon’t get to deal with the question of final time. We all die. It’s just that,in this age, the death of the individual and the death of the species aresomehow both possible to contemplate.Ralph: And the death of all other species.Terence: Many traditions teach that life is organization for the purpose ofcreating a kind of after-death vehicle in a higher dimension that will survivethe transition. Building such a vehicle is seen as the true purpose of life.This is the transition to light that so many traditions have anticipated.Rupert: What people believe happens to them after death makes a difference inthe way they face death. Many people who have had a near-death experience saythey no longer fear death because they know there is something beyond it. It ispossible that vast numbers of people going through the barrier of death at thesame time may be creating a kind of group mind of a kind never before realized.Why the apocalypse is such a strong attractor is an interesting question. Theattractor beyond all the doom may be another state of being that isextraordinarily blissful compared with anything we know here, as well as moreperfect. This is the fantasy of the recovery of Eden, the Promised Land. There’ssomething quite magical and infinitely attractive about this idea that hasmotivated the entire historical process.Ralph: It is the Rapture. This is the antidote that’s more or less built intothe apocalyptic vision in Saint John.Rupert: Let me add one more ingredient to this particular line of thought. Irecently took part in a discussion with Brian Swimme, who was exploring the ideathat the universe, like a developing organism, has phases at which particularkinds of things happen. In an evolutionary cosmos, there is a time when atomsfirst come into being. Then there is a time when galaxies form. Then there is atime when the stars are old enough to explode into supernovas, releasing thestardust out of which planets are made. Like a developing embryo, cosmicdevelopment has particular phases that are roughly synchronous throughout theuniverse. Therefore, if there is life on other planets, its evolutionary stagemight not be very different from ours.I had also been thinking about parallel evolution on other Earthlike planets andthe possible effects it would have on our own evolution through morphicresonance. I asked Brian for a rough estimate of how close the development ofsuch other Earthlike planets might be to our own. He said perhaps within 50,000to 500,000 years. If there is indeed morphic resonance between similar planets,then when a new form appears on Earth it’s more likely to appear on otherplanets. If any planets got far in the lead, morphic resonance would tend tomake the others catch up. With cosmic synchronization through morphic resonance,there is the sense of a possible cosmic apocalypse.Ralph: Death on a cosmic scale.Rupert: Or the total transformation of the soul of the world.Ralph: Well, I hope we can transform the apocalypse myth and make it suitablefor something other than destruction.Rupert: In the green psychedelic churches of the Amazon, there is an Incanversion of the apocalypse myth in which a dragon in the last days comes and eatsup the forest, burning and destroying everything.In the last days, the struggle between the serpent and the forces of life growsever more intense. People are forced to take sides. It is no longer possible tosit on the fence because the fence itself is crumbling.There will be an intense polarization as the new millennium approaches becausethese forces will become ever more powerful, preparing for the final battle.Through faith in victory over the dragon, victory will be achieved.A dragon, incidentally, is prophesied at the very beginning of Anglo-Saxonliberal political theory. In Hobbes’ model, individuals are like atoms in thebody of Leviathan. The dragon that is destroying the Amazon forest is the greatLeviathan of modern society. The struggle is going on now; the outcome isuncertain.Rubbing out the apocalyptic model, getting rid of it, suppressing it, orpsychically engineering it out of our psyche is perhaps no longer possible. Thedragon of destruction, Leviathan, is itself motivated by a millenarian faith:the dream of conquering nature and subduing its destructive powers. Whereas forthe heroes of scientific progress the dragon was nature, for modern greens thedragon is the human system; this Leviathan is devouring the forests, burningthings up, and polluting the world.We’re in the morphic field of the millenarian process. Only another millenarianscenario can undo the earlier one that has proved so destructive.Ralph: From chaos we came and unto chaos we shall return.Terence: The middle name of chaos is opportunity."},{"pageContent":"ResourcesVideotapes of the first four trialogues are available from:Workshop Videos620 Almar Ave.Santa Cruz, CA 95060Audiotapes of all the trialogues are available from:Dolphin TapesP.O.

Alchemists, who belonged to the Hermetic tradition, sought totransmute base matter or spirit into noble through magical and chemicalmanipulations. (Cf. Hermetic Tradition.)Animism: The view that nature is alive rather than inanimate.Antiparticle: A subatomic particle that has the same mass as another particle,but an equal and opposite value of some other property. For example, theantiparticle of a negatively charged electron is a positively charged positron.Apocalypse: The Judeo-Christian and Islamic belief in the entry of God intohistory and the subsequent end of the world.Astral Plane: According to occult doctrines, a plane of existence beyond thephysical realm; the first sphere of existence after the death of the body, whichalso can be visited in dreams and out-of-body journeys.Attractor: In the mathematical theory of dynamical systems, an irreducibleinvariant set that attracts the trajectories of all nearby points.Bifurcation Theory: A branch of chaos theory dealing with the changes in theconfiguration of attractors caused by changes in the rules defining thedynamical system.Chaoscopy: A computer-based technique for the observation of the hidden formwithin chaotic data. Also known as attractor reconstruction.Chaos Theory: The branch of mathematics dealing with dynamical systems. Alsoknown as dynamical systems theory.Chaotic Attractor: Any attractor that is more complicated than a single point ora cycle.Chreode: A canalized pathway of change within a morphic field.Concrescence: From the metaphysics of Alfred North Whitehead, concrescence isthe knitting together of disparate elements into a unified nexus.Cosmology: The study of the evolution, general structure, and nature of theuniverse as a whole.Dakini: Literally, “sky dancer.” A dynamic, energizing, and feminine principlein Tibetan tantrism. She may manifest as a human being, as a peaceful orwrathful goddess, or as the general play of energy in the phenomenal world.Dark Matter: Also known as the “missing mass”; seems to make up from 90 to 99percent of the matter in the universe and is of unknown nature.Deism: Belief in God on the basis of reason alone, usually confining the role ofGod to creating the universe and establishing the laws of nature.Determinism: The doctrine that all events, including human actions, arepredetermined.Dialectic: The conversational method of argument, involving question and answer.In Hegelian and Marxist philosophy, a pattern of development by means ofcontradiction and reconciliation, involving thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.Ecosystem: A community of organisms together with the environment in which theylive; for example, a tropical rain forest.Elementals: Personified natural forces; faeries, sprites, and nixies are amongthe elementals.Entelechy: In the philosophy of Aristotle and in vitalist biology, the principleof life, identified with the soul or psyche. Entelechy gives an organism its owninternal purposes and defines the end toward which it develops.Entropy: A quantity defined in terms of thermodynamics. The entropy of a systemis the measure of its degree of disorder. According to the second law ofthermodynamics, the entropy of closed systems increases with time.Epigenesis: The origin of new structures during embryonic development.Eschatology: A branch of theology dealing with the “four last things”: death,judgment, heaven, and hell.Eucaryotes: Living organisms consisting of cells with nuclei, such as fungi,plants, and animals. (Cf. procaryotes.)Fastnacht: A medieval festival, recently reinstituted to relieve the boredom ofwinter in Switzerland.Field: A region of physical influence. In current physics, several kinds offundamental fields are recognized: the gravitational and electromagnetic fieldsand the matter fields of quantum physics. In biology, morphogenetic fields(q.v.) organize the development and maintenance of bodily form. According to thehypothesis of formative causation (q.v.), morphic fields organize the structureand behavior of organisms at all levels of complexity and contain an inherentmemory.Formative Causation: The hypothesis, first proposed by Rupert Sheldrake in 1981,that self-organizing systems at all levels of complexity are organized bymorphic fields, which are themselves influenced and stabilized by morphicresonance from all previous similar systems.Fractal: Name introduced around 1967 by Benoit B. Mandelbrot for a geometricobject with a fractional dimension, such as the coastline of California near BigSur.Gaia: Mother Earth. The Gaia hypothesis, proposed by James Lovelock, regards theEarth as a self-regulating, living organism.Geodynamics: Continental drift, earthquakes, volcanism, atmospheric and oceaniccurrents, and other physical processes that shape the Earth.Gnosticism: The belief in salvation or liberation through esoteric knowledge;usually associated with a sharp distinction between the spiritual world,regarded as good, and the material world, regarded as evil.Hermeneutics: A philosophical tradition, evolving from Old Testament scholarshipinto literary criticism, cultural history, and the philosophy of science, inwhich the intellectual functions of perception, interpretation, and constructionof consensual reality are closed into a loop called the critical circle orhermeneutical cycle.Hermetic Tradition: One of the spiritual traditions of late antiquity inAlexandria, tracing its source to Hermes Trismegistus. It produced theHermetica, which include the Hermetic Corpus (containing about seventeen books,including the Poimander), the Asclepius, and other writings. The Hermetic Corpuspresents alchemical, magical, astrological, and philosophical doctrines ofliberation. The Poimander (divine mind) speaks to Hermes, who receives a visionof light, from which the logos and then the universe are created. The Asclepiusexplains the creation of everything from the One, including the hierarchy ofangels. The Hermetic tradition posited that the elemental world was infused byastral influences—“as above, so below.” It exerted great influence on theNeoplatonists of the Florentine Renaissance such as Marsilio Ficino and Picodella Mirandola. (Cf. Alchemy, Logos.)Hologram: A photographic record of a three-dimensional object made with a splitbeam of light from a laser. From a part of a hologram, an image of the wholeobject can be reconstituted.Humanism: In its literary sense, the intellectual movement that characterizedthe culture of Renaissance Europe. In its usual modern sense, a rejection of allreligious beliefs and an insistence that we should be exclusively concerned withhuman welfare in this material world, assumed to be the only one.Hypostatization: A concept symbolized in concrete form; the process of ascribingmaterial existence to something.Logos: A divine realm, basic to the Alexandrian tradition since the time ofPhilo the Jew.M-Field: An abbreviation for morphogenetic field or morphic field.Mechanistic Theory: Based on the metaphor of the machine. The doctrine that allphysical phenomena can be explained mechanically, without reference to goals orpurposive designs. (Cf. Teleology.)Millennium: The year ending a thousand-year period, for example A.D. 2001. InChristian theology, the millennium refers to a thousand-year period of peace andprosperity expected to occur immediately before the end of the world.Mitosis: The usual process by which the nucleus of a living cell divides intotwo.Morphic Field: A field within and around a self-organizing system that organizesits characteristic structure and pattern of activity. According to thehypothesis of formative causation, morphic fields contain an inherent memorytransmitted from previous similar systems by morphic resonance and tend tobecome increasingly habitual. Morphic fields include morphogenetic, behavioral,social, cultural, and mental fields. The greater the degree of similarity, thegreater the influence of morphic resonance. In general, systems most closelyresemble themselves in the past and are subject to self-resonance from their ownpast states.Morphic Resonance: The influence of previous structures of activity onsubsequent similar structures of activity organized by morphic fields. Accordingto the hypothesis of formative causation, morphic resonance involves thetransmission of formative influences through or across time and space without adecrease due to distance or lapse of time.Morphogenesis: The coming into being of form.Morphogenetic Fields: Fields that play a causal role in morphogenesis. Thisterm, first proposed in the 1920s, is now widely used by developmentalbiologists. According to the hypothesis of formative causation, these fieldscontain an inherent memory, transmitted from similar past organisms by theprocess of morphic resonance.Mycelium: The undifferentiated threadlike tissue that precedes the developmentof a fruiting body in the life cycle of mushrooms.Neopagan Tradition: A new wave of resurgence of pre-Christian religion andbelief.Neoplatonism: A development of Plato’s philosophy combining mystical, Oriental,and Aristotelian influences, first systematized in Alexandria in the thirdcentury A.D. by Plotinus. Like Platonic philosophy, it postulates a transcendentrealm of changeless archetypes or Forms; it also emphasizes that just as allliving beings are animated by immanent souls, so the entire cosmos is animatedby the world soul.Novelty Wave: Hypothetical alternative to probability theory developed byTerence McKenna; the novelty wave is variable, which determines the rate andtimes at which statistically improbable events may occur.Omega Point: The state of complex unity toward which everything is developing,according to the philosophy of the evolutionary mystic Teilhard de Chardin, whodescribed it as “a distinct Centre radiating at the core of a system of centres… a supremely autonomous focus of union.”Ontology: The philosophical study of existence itself, differentiating between“real existence” and “appearance.” Also, the assumptions about existenceunderlying any theory or system of ideas.Oversoul: A synonym for the supraphysical realm called the world soul by Platoin his dialogue, the Timaeus, resurrected under this name by the Americantranscendentalists Emerson and Thoreau.Paradigm: An example or pattern. In the sense of the philosopher T. S. Kuhn,scientific paradigms are general ways of seeing the world that are shared bymembers of a scientific community, and they provide models of acceptable ways inwhich problems can be solved. Scientific revolutions are associated with changeof paradigm, or “paradigm shifts.”Paranormal Phenomena: Little-understood and often elusive phenomena that lieoutside the scope of current scientific orthodoxy.Patrilineal: The form of society in which property belongs to men and descendsfrom father to son.Pheromones: Organic chemicals produced to convey information among the variousmembers of a species; ants, for example, use pheromones to communicate.Pineal Gland: A small organ of uncertain function found in the human brain atthe roof of the third ventricle. Descartes placed the “seat of the soul” in thepineal.Plebiscite: An expression of popular will; for example, by direct vote.Primal Unified Field: Hypothetical state of the early universe, before theSymmetry break that gave rise to the four elementary forces. (See SuperstringTheory.)Procaryotes: Cells or organisms lacking cell nuclei, such as bacteria andblue-green algae. (Cf. Eucaryotes.)Psychedelics: A family of psychoactive indole compounds such as LSD, psilocybin,and DMT that cause visionary hallucinations.Pulsar: A compact star produced as the remnant of a stellar explosion. Pulsarsspin very rapidly, and, through magnetism and charged particles, produce veryregular bursts of radio noise.Quantum Theory: A departure from classical Newtonian mechanics, based on theprinciple that certain physical quantities can assume only discrete values.Quantum mechanics has several seemingly paradoxical features, including the waythat entities such as photons and electrons can be regarded as both waves andparticles.Quasar: An object that appears to be an ordinary star but with very large redshifts. A quasar is a quasistellar object.Reductionism: The doctrine that complex systems can be explained in terms ofsimpler ones; for example, living organisms in terms of inanimatephysicochemical processes.Resacralization: The recognition of the sacredness of that which has beendesecrated or treated as devoid of spiritual presence.Resonant Wave Phenomenon: The production of a wavelike pattern in one elasticmedium through weak coupling to a similar pattern in another nearby medium by aprocess of resonance; for example, when one piano string is struck, a sound isexcited in nearby strings.Runnel: Properly, a small brook or watercourse. In morphic fields, a well-wornpath or habit of thought.Scientism: A faith in natural science as the only valid source of authority.Seed Crystals: Crystals introduced into a saturated solution to causecrystallization of the dissolved material.Serotonin: One of several neurotransmitters necessary to ordinary brainfunction.Shaman: Practitioner of an archaic style of healing and natural magic. Shamansare masters of the archaic techniques of ecstasy.Singularity: In physics, a domain or situation in which the laws of physicseither do not apply or have been broken down; the center of a black hole is asingularity, for example.Space/Time Continuum: The four-dimensional geometric model for natural historiespopularized by Albert Einstein in his theories of relativity.Superconductivity: Zero-resistance conduction of electricity by some metals andalloys at low temperatures.Superspace: Hypothetical dimensions in which ordinary space and time areembedded.Superstring Theory: First proposed in the 1980s, superstring theory modelsparticles not as points but as vibrating and rotating “strings.” In one versionthere are ten dimensions, nine of space and one of time. Superstring theorypostulates an original unified field at the birth of the cosmos that gave riseto the known fields of physics as the universe expanded.Syncretism: The attempt to blend together seemingly inharmonious elements fromdifferent systems of philosophy or religion.Teleology: The study of ends or final causes; the explanation of phenomena byreference to goals or purposes.Temponaut: A time traveler.Theosophy: An esoteric system of understanding the nature of the divine and itsrelation to the living cosmos. The Theosophical Society, founded in 1875, drawstogether Hindu, Buddhist, Western and other wisdom traditions, and it has donemuch to disseminate occult ideas in the Western world.Uroboric Symbol: Ancient image of a snake taking its tail in its mouth; symbolof eternity and the completed alchemical process.World Soul: Also known as the anima mundi, the animating principle of the wholeworld."},{"pageContent":"BibliographyAbraham, R., and C.
