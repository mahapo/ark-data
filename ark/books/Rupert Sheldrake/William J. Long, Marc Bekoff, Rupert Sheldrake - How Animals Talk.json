It mademe realize that unexplained abilities like telepathy and the sense of beingstared at are widespread in the animal kingdom. When they occur in people, theyare often called \"paranormal,\" literally meaning beyond the normal, or they aretreated as weird or spooky, or simply dismissed as illusions. Reading this bookconvinced me that they are normal, not paranormal, and are part of ourbiological nature.Jill Puree, later my wife, gave this book to me in 1983, having found it in asecondhand bookshop in Holt, a small town in Norfolk. She thought it wouldinterest me, and she was right. I read it with increasing fascination. I hadnever heard of William Long and had no idea that any naturalist had studiedtelepathy and other related powers of animals, let alone in such an interestingway. The topics Long explored were taboo among scientists when this book wasfirst published in 1919, and the taboo persisted throughout the twentiethcentury. Long was a great pioneer.This book is not only rich in implications for further research, it is a delightto read. Long writes as a naturalist and as a lover of nature. His style ischaracteristically American, in the tradition of Henry David Thoreau. Americanwriting about nature has a different quality from anything in Europe. TheAmerican experience is so much closer to wilderness. European landscapes havebeen altered over millennia by agriculture and by the grazing of herds ofdomesticated animals. But in most of North America the native inhabitants werehunters and gatherers, not agriculturalists, and their relationship to wildanimals and plants was very different from that of Europeans; they lived withthem; they shared their world with other species. They were not proprietors,developers, and real estate dealers. Long was directly connected to NativeAmerican traditions through his Indian guides, one of whom was called Simmo, ofwhom he wrote, \"Where Emerson gives you a mystical word or a bare assertionwhich he cannot possibly prove, Simmo has a disconcerting way of establishing achallenged doctrine by a concrete and undeniable fact\" (p. 65–66).How Animals Talk is really three books in one. The first part includes apioneering study of animal communication, and of telepathy in particular. Thesecond, \"How to Know the Wood Folk\" (chapters 7–9), is about what happens whenwe learn to keep still, and includes a remarkable discussion of the feeling ofbeing watched. The third part, \"My Pond: A Symphony of the Woods\" (chapters10–15), is a delightful account of one of Long's favorite secret places, wherehe spent many hours alone.In How Animals Talk Long shows how telepathic abilities are not confined to wildanimals, but are also present in the animals we know best, our domesticatedcompanions. In particular, he describes how his dog Don knew when he was cominghome (chapter 4); and his account of another return-anticipating dog, Watch, isa pioneering study of this phenomenon. When I read these passages, I was alreadyintrigued by the ability of dogs and cats to know when their owners werereturning. Long's observations encouraged me to start investigating this subjectmyself In my book Seven Experiments that Could Change the World (1994; secondedition 2002*1 [9781591438984_ftn.htm#ftn1]), I proposed experiments to see ifdogs really can tell when their owners are coming home through some kind oftelepathy. In these tests, the person comes home at a non-routine time in anunfamiliar vehicle, so that explanations in terms of routine and familiar carsounds can be eliminated. I carried out many such tests myself, and investigatedmany return-anticipating animals, including cats, horses, and parrots. Isummarize the evidence from more than 1,000 case histories ofreturn-anticipating pets and more than 100 videotaped experiments with dogs inmy book Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home, And Other UnexplainedPowers of Animals (1999). My findings agree with Long's.Another of my seven experiments concerned the sense of being stared at, thenatural history of which Long explores in chapters 7 and 8 of How Animals Talk.By means of controlled experiments, dozens of investigators have now confirmedthe existence of this sense in humans, and surveys show that a large majority ofthe population have experienced this phenomenon themselves. Many people havealso experienced the sense of being watched by animals. I summarize recentresearch on this subject in my book The Sense of Being Stared At: And OtherAspects of the Extended Mind (2003). Again, this research agrees with what Longfound so many years before.William Joseph Long was born in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, in 1866, ofIrish parentage, descended on his mother's side from Edmund Burke, the politicalphilosopher. He was educated at Harvard and Andover theological seminary, and hetook a Ph.D. in theology at Heidelberg, Germany. He also studied in Rome and atthe University of Paris. He was an ordained minister in the CongregationalChurch and in the 1890s became prominent as a liberal theologian. He lived inStamford, Connecticut, and spent his vacations camping, canoeing, exploring, andsalmon fishing. These experiences formed the basis for his writings as anaturalist, and in addition to How Animals Talk, he wrote a number of otherbooks, including School of the Woods: Some Lift Studies of Animal Instinct andAnimal Training (1902), Northern Trails (1905), and Mother Nature: A Study ofAnimal Lift and Death (1922).In the early twentieth century, there were two main schools of writing aboutnature, the naturalists and the hunters. At the end of the first edition of HowAnimals Talk there are advertisements for hunting books from the same publishersincluding Hunting At High Altitudes, which describes how a Colonel Pickett \"isbelieved to have killed no less than seventy-eight full grown grizzlies,\" andall in a single hunting season. A book by Theodore Roosevelt called Good Huntingis commended as standing for \"sturdy manliness,\" while another of Roosevelt'sbooks describes \"hunting in East Africa and the Gulf of Cortes; Canadianmoose-hunt; wolf-hunting in Russia; deer-hunting in the Sierras; big game inMongolia and Tibet.\"Roosevelt was annoyed by the writings of naturalists such as Long, who generallyadopted what we would now call an ecological approach, and was particularlyoffended by the influence they had on children and on their attitude towardnature. In 1907, while president of the United States, Roosevelt launched anattack on Long and his fellow nature-writers. In the ensuing uproar, thepresident was condemned in the press for attacking private citizens from theWhite House, and cartoonists depicted wildlife fleeing before a menacingpresident, armed to his prominent teeth. Long himself wrote one of the mostdevastating counterattacks, printed in newspapers throughout the nation: \"Who ishe [Roosevelt] to write, 'I don't believe that some of these nature-writers knowthe heart of wild things?' I find that after carefully reading two of his bigbooks that every time he gets near to the heart of a wild thing he invariablyputs a bullet through it.\"*2 [9781591438984_ftn.htm#ftn2]In spite of his revulsion for the destructive effects of modern man, Long made aclear distinction between nature's ways and human feelings. For example, in thechapter entitled \"The Trail,\" he reflects on the impact of loggers: \"Noblemaples or cedars that were centuries growing have been slashed down,dismembered, thrust aside to decay, and all because they stood in the way of alumber-boss who thought only of getting his cut of spruce down to the lake. Tolook upon such tress, dead and shorn of their beauty, is to feel pity orindignation; but Nature does not share your feeling, being too abundant of lifeand resource to waste any moment in regret. Already she is up building what manhas torn down. Glaring ax-wounds have all disappeared under bandages of livingmoss; every fallen log has hidden its loss under a mantle of lichen, soft andgray, which speaks not of death but of life renewed\" (p. 218-19).For Long there was clearly no conflict between his love of nature and his faithin God, and he emphasized the importance of openness, of not being so intent onone's own purposes that sight dominates insight: ''All sciences, includingchartography and angling, can easily be learned by any man; but understanding isa gift of God, and it comes only to those who keep their hearts open\" (p. 221).For many years, Long has been more or less forgotten. But he still has much toteach us about nature, about the appreciation of nature, and about animalbehavior in particular. I was delighted to find that my friend Marc Bekoffshared my enthusiasm for Long's writings, and we are both very pleased thatInner Traditions • Bear & Company is now republishing How Animals Talk so thatothers can share in the excitement of rediscovering this remarkable book.RUPERT SHELDRAKEAPRIL 2005image [images/9781591438984_006.jpg]Rupert Sheldrake, Ph.D., is a biologist and author of more than seventy-fivetechnical papers and ten books.

Its subtitle, And Other Pleasant Studies ofBirds and Beasts, is indicative of William J. Long's sheer and unbridled delightin observing and learning about the mysterious ways of the nonhuman animalbeings (\"animals\") with whom we share the earth. A curious naturalist at heart,Long shows how curiosity, patient observation, and detailed descriptions canhelp us understand and appreciate animals, vertebrates and invertebrates alike,from wolves to insects, deer to ducks. Long also emphasizes how important it isto know about the natural history of different species and how deficientarmchair speculations about animal behavior really are. The value of long-termdetailed observations can't be emphasized too strongly. Far too many people—thenand now—who write about animal behavior haven't actually carefully observed orstudied animals or even shared their homes with them. Long embraced naturalhistory, a supposedly \"soft science\" that is often dismissed by people whoremain in the ivory tower of their armchairs and don't take the time to get outto observe and study animals where they live. I couldn't agree more with hisapproach.In How Animals Talk Long presages numerous areas that currently are \"hot topics\"in the study of animal behavior and presents a staggering array of animals. Hediscusses chumfo, the super-sense, a word for which he is indebted to an Africantribe living near Lake Mweru. Long notes, ''According to these natives, everynatural animal, man included, has the physical gifts of touch, sight, hearing,taste, smell, and chumfo.... This chumfo is not a sixth or extra sense, as weassume, but rather the unity or perfect co-ordination of the five senses attheir highest point\" (p. 54). So, often, when we are amazed at the sensoryabilities of many animals and how in touch they are with their surroundings itis because they \"are there,\" they are totally present and are able to integrateinformation across the different senses. This discussion presages the relativelynew field called sensory ecology.Long also points in the direction of behavioral phenomena that still needdetailed study, such as animal telepathy. He recognizes that there is no proofof animal telepathy but that it is a working hypothesis that deserves closeattention. He finds that \"wild birds and beasts all exercise a measure of thatmysterious telepathic power which reappears now and then in some sensitive manor woman\" (p. 157). And in his chapter \"On Keeping Still\" Long writes about the\"feeling of being watched\" that he says \"may be too intangible for experiment,or even for definition\" (p. 181).Long's knowledge of animal behavior is astounding, even by today's standards.And that is among the reasons why his book deserves to be rediscovered by abroad audience in a world in which more and more people are craving to learn asmuch as they can about our animal kin. Our old brains, still very muchpaleolithic-like, draw us back to nature as magnets attract iron to theirsurfaces. In the absence of animals we are alone in a silent world, torn apartfrom other beings who help define who we are in the grand scheme of things.Long also isn't afraid of recognizing the importance of what I call thenotorious \"A\" words—\"Anecdote\" and \"Anthropomorphism.\" Stories underlie allsorts of research, from physics to philosophy, biology to sociology,anthropology to theology. The same is so for studies of animal behavior. Forexample, he describes the wonderful color plate showing a family of red foxeswith the caption \"The old vixen lies apart where she can overlook the play andthe neighborhood.\" As he marvels at the silent communication that occurs betweenthe mother fox and her young he says, \"If a human mother could exercise suchsilent, perfect discipline, or leave the house with the certainty that four orfive lively youngsters would keep out of danger or mischief as completely asyoung fox cubs keep out of it, raising children might more resemble 'one grandsweet song' than it does at present\" (p. 85).The plural of anecdote is data and there is no adequate substitute for beinganthropomorphic; we can only communicate about animals with the language we usein all other aspects of our daily lives. A quotation from another of Long'swonderful books, Brier-Patch Philosophy by \"Peter Rabbit\" published in 1906,eloquently captures his views on anthropomorphism: \"It is possible, therefore,that your simple man who lives close to nature and speaks in enduring humanterms, is nearer to the truth of animal life than is your psychologist, wholives in a library and to-day speaks a language that is to-morrow forgotten.\"The careful use of anthropomorphism, in which we always take into account theanimal's point of view, can only make the study of animal behavior more rigorousand more interesting and challenging. As human beings trying to learn as much aswe can about animals we have to use the words with which we're most familiar totalk about our observations of animal behavior and to convey our knowledge.Claims that anthropomorphism has no place in science or that anthropomorphicpredictions and explanations are less accurate than more mechanistic orreductionistic \"scientific\" explanations are not supported by any data. This isan empirical matter and before someone posits that anthropomorphism is a badhabit, he or she needs to show that it is not as good as other sorts ofexplanations. We really don't get any information at all about context, socialor otherwise, if we describe grief or joy, for example, as a series ofneuromuscular firings, as different types of brain activity, or as neurochemicalreactions. Anthropomorphism is a great aid in making sense of animal behavior,and is alive and well as it should be. But, let me stress again that it must beused with care and we must always attempt to take into account each animal'spoint of view.In How Animals Talk Long delves into animal communication, cognition, emotions,and telepathy. He isn't afraid to cover topics that some scientists would call\"taboo,\" and it is refreshing to discover that he knew an incredible amountabout a vast number of different patterns of animal behavior, including somethat do not lend themselves to hard-and-fast unambiguous explanations or, forthat matter, easy data collection. The title of this book itself shows that Longknew that animals talked to one another, and it's hard to believe that some ofmy colleagues today wonder if this is so!Long also knew that many animals experience rich and deep emotional lives andhave a sense of morality (what I call \"wild justice\"). This is an area ofresearch in which I've been keenly interested in for decades. In my opinion,it's not a question of if emotions have evolved but rather why they haveevolved. Surely, a whimpering or playing dog, or a chimpanzee in a tiny cage orgrieving the loss of a friend, or a baby pig having her tail cut off—\"docked\" asthis horrific and inexcusable procedure is called—or having her teeth grounddown on a grindstone, feel something. And surely, animals don't like beingshocked, cut up, starved, chained, stunned, crammed into prison like cages, tiedup, isolated, or ripped away from their families and friends.Long knew, as we do, that animals aren't unfeeling objects. If they were, I'msure he wouldn't have found animals to be so fascinating. Scientific data, whatI call \"science sense,\" along with common sense, compassion, and heart, are allneeded to learn more about animal passions and how animals feel about theinnumerable situations in which they find themselves. Emotions function as asocial glue and as social catalysts. Animal emotions and mood swings grab us,and it's highly likely that many animals exclaim \"Wow!\" or \"My goodness, what ishappening?\" as they go through their days enjoying some activities and alsoexperiencing pain and suffering at the hands of humans.In How Animals Talk readers will discover lengthy descriptive discussions ofplay, aggression, territoriality, homing, communication, mating, socialorganization (called the herd phenomena and the swarming instinct), andcaregiving behavior in a wide variety of species. Long clearly knew about whatis now called the \"human dimension,\" the human or anthropogenic effects on thebehavior of animals stemming from our incessant intrusions and trespasses intotheir lives. He notes that we have changed the behavior of many wild animals,for example, their fear responses to our presence and their subsequent use ofspace. Many individuals of different species change their daily activities andtravel patterns when humans are present. We always need to remember and to knowabout the ubiquitous consequences of our presence. We truly are here, there, andeverywhere.Concerning my own interests in how studies of animal behavior, especially theiremotions and sentience, can influence our understanding of them and how we treatthem, Long's book, though written decades ago, lays the foundation for a changein how we should use and abuse animals in factory farms, in circuses and rodeos,and in education and research. As we change the paradigm and move forward we'rein a good position to use as a guide what has come to be called the\"precautionary principle.\" Basically this principle maintains that a lack offull scientific certainty should not be used as an excuse to delay taking actionon some issue. In the arena of animal emotions and animal sentience, I haveargued that we do know enough to make informed decisions about animal emotionsand animal sentience and why they matter. And even if we might be \"wrong\" someof the time this does not mean we're wrong all of the time. At least we won't beadding more cruelty to an already cruel world, by granting that animals areemotional, sentient beings and accordingly treating them with respect. When indoubt we should err on the side of the individual animal. I'm sure Long wouldagree with these sentiments.It's also okay for researchers to be sentimental and to go from their heart. Weneed more compassion and love in science, more heartfelt and heartful science.Simply put, we must \"mind\" animals and redecorate nature very carefully. We mustblend together scientific science sense with common sense, compassion, and heartin our efforts to provide the best treatment for all animals all of the time.Perhaps if enough people read this book there will be a change in how we move onfrom here. Reducing animals to mere numbers or objects, and sanitizingdescriptions of their behavior and emotional lives with cold, terse, andthird-person prose (\"the researcher watched the subject\") rather thanfirst-person prose, objectifies animals and distances \"us\" from \"them.\" Thisdualism must be resisted vigorously. We are not the only animals who arerational, conscious, self-cognizant, able to manufacture and use tools, displayculture, draw and paint, reflect on the past and make plans for the future, orcommunicate using a sophisticated set of rules that resemble what we calllanguage. Perhaps we're the only species that cooks its food, but because thereare so many startling things that remain to be studied, maybe we're not. I foundmyself making an ever-growing mental list of things that I didn't know as I readLong's book, and I've been studying animal behavior for a long time. That's howinnovative this book really is.When I try to imagine what Long was feeling when he wrote How Animals Talk, Ismile and can feel his unbounded delight and awe at the magnificence of so manydifferent animals. His careful fieldwork presages that of many ethologists whofollowed, including the three winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology orMedicine in 1973: Nikolaas Tinbergen (often called the curious naturalist),Konrad Lorenz, and Karl von Frisch, who won for their discoveries concerninganimal behavior.I would love to have been William Long's student! And, in reading through Long'sbook I have indeed become his student. I admire Long's dedication to learning asmuch as he could about animals and for being so open about all that we don'tknow. Throughout How Animals Talk I was reminded of a wonderful quotationoffered by Jules Henri Poincare: \"The scientist does not study nature because itis useful, he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in itbecause it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worthknowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living.\"Rupert and I take great pleasure in sharing this book with as many other peopleas we can. I only wish that Long could know that he has been rediscovered and soappreciated eight and a half decades after How Animals Talk first appeared. Sosit back and enjoy the journey that Long lays out for all interested parties.Rupert and I agree that reading Long's book is a most pleasurable adventure intothe heads and hearts of diverse groups of nonhuman animal beings. We feel sovery lucky to have rediscovered this forward-looking, delightful, andstimulating book. We hope you'll agree.MARC BEKOFFAPRIL 2005image [images/9781591438984_002.jpg]Marc Bekoff is a professor of biology at the University of Colorado, Boulder,and is a fellow of the Animal Behavior Society and a former Guggenheim fellow.In 2000 he was awarded the Exemplar Award from the Animal Behavior Society formajor long-term contributions to the field of animal behavior.

And a very woodsy trail you shall find it, dim and solitary, withplenty of \"blind\" spots where one may easily go astray, and without any promiseof what waits at the other end of it.One summer afternoon I was reading by the open window, while my old setter, Don,lay flat on his side in the shade of a syringa-bush. He had scooped out a hollowto suit him, and was enjoying the touch of the cool earth when a fat littleterrier, a neighbor's pet, came running with evident excitement to wake the olddog up. Don half raised his head, recognized his friend Nip and thumped theground lazily with his tail.\"It's all right, little dog. You're always excited over something of noconsequence; but don't bother me this hot day,\" he said, in dog-talk, anddropped his head to sleep again.But Nip was not to be put aside, having something big on his mind. He nudged Donsharply, and the old dog sprang to his feet as if galvanized. For an interval ofperhaps five seconds they stood motionless, tense, their noses almost touching;then Don's plume began to wave.\"Oh, I see!\" he said; and Nip's stubby tail whipped violently, as if to add,\"Thank Heaven you do, at last!\" The next moment they were away on the jump anddisappeared round a corner of the house.Here was comedy afoot, so I slipped out through the back door to follow it. Thedogs took no notice of me, and probably had no notion that they were observed;for I took pains to keep out of sight till the play was over. Through thehay-field they led me, across the pasture lot, and over a wall at the foot of ahalf-cultivated hillside. Peering through a chink of the wall, I saw Nip dancingand barking at a rock-pile, and between two of the rocks was a woodchuckcornered.For weeks Nip had been laying siege to that same woodchuck, which had a den onthe hillside in a patch of red clover, most convenient to some garden truck. Adozen times, to my knowledge, the little dog had rushed the rascal; but as Nipwas fat and the chuck cunning, the chase always ended the same way, one comediandiving into the earth with a defiant whistle, leaving the other to scratch orbark impotently outside.Any reasonable dog would soon have tired of such an uneven game; but a terrieris not a reasonable dog. At first Nip tried his best to drag Don into theaffair; but the old setter had long since passed the heyday of youth, when anykind of an adventure could interest him. In the presence of grouse or woodcockhe would still become splendidly animate, and then the years would slip from himas a garment; but to stupid groundhogs and all such \"small deer\" he was loftilyindifferent. He was an aristocrat, of true-blue blood, and I had trained him tolet all creatures save his proper game severely alone. So, after following Niponce and finding nothing more exciting than a hole in the ground, with thefamiliar smell of woodchuck about it, he had left the terrier to his ownamusement.When speed failed, or wind, it was vastly amusing to watch Nip try to adoptcat-strategy, hiding, creeping, scheming to cut off the enemy's retreat. Almostevery day he would have another go at the impossible; but he was too fat, tooslow, too clumsy, and also too impatient after his doggy kind. By a great efforthe could hold still when his game poked a cautious head out of the burrow for alook all around; but no sooner did the chuck begin to move away from his doorwaythan the little dog began to fidget in his hiding-place, and his tail (the onepart of a dog that cannot lie) would wildly betray his emotions. Invariably hemade his rush too soon, and the woodchuck whistled into his den with time tospare.On this summer afternoon, however, Nip had better luck or used better tactics.Whether he went round the hill and came over the top from an unexpected quarter,or lay in wait in his accustomed place with more than his accustomed patience, Ihave no means of knowing. By some new device or turn of luck he certainly camebetween the game and its stronghold; whereupon the chuck scuttled down the hilland took refuge among the rocks. There Nip's courage failed him. He was a littledog with a big bark; and the sight of the grizzled veteran with back against astone and both flanks protected probably made him realize that it is one thingto chase a chuck which runs away, but quite another thing to enter his cavewhile he stands facing you, his beady eyes snapping and his big teeth bare. Soafter a spell of brave barking Nip had rushed off to fetch a larger dog.All that was natural enough, and very doglike; at least it so appeared to me,after seeing other little dogs playa similar part; but the amazing feature ofthis particular comedy was that Nip had no difficulty in getting help from achampion who had refused to be interested up to that critical moment. Throughthe wall I saw him lead Don straight to the rocks. The old dog thrust in hishead, yelped once as he was bitten, dragged out the chuck, gave him a shake anda quieting crunch; then, without the slightest evident concern, he left Nip toworry and finish and brag over the enemy.It is part of the fascination of watching any animal comedy that it alwaysleaves you with a question; and the unanswerable question here was, How did Niplet the other dog know what he wanted?If you are intimate enough with dogs to have discovered that they depend ontheir noses for all accurate information, that they have, as it were, asmellscape instead of a landscape forever before them, you will say at once,\"Don must have smelled woodchuck\"; but that is a merely convenient answer whichdoes not explain or even consider the facts. Don already knew the general smellof woodchuck very well, and was, moreover, acquainted with the odor of theparticular woodchuck to which his little dog-chum had been laying siege. He knewit at first hand from the creature itself, having once put his nose into theburrow; he got a secondary whiff of it every time Nip returned from hisfruitless digging; and he was utterly indifferent to such foolish hunting. Manytimes before the day of reckoning arrived Nip had rushed into the yard in thesame excitement, with the same reek of earth and woodchuck about him; and, sofar as one may judge a dog by his action, Don took no interest in the littledog's story. Yet he was off on the instant of hearing that the familiar smell ofwoodchuck now meant something more than a hole in the ground.That some kind of message passed between the two dogs is, I think, beyond areasonable doubt; and it is precisely this silent and mysterious kind ofcommunication (the kind that occurs when your dog comes to you when you arereading, looks intently into your face, and tells you without words that hewants a drink or that it is time for him to be put to bed) that I propose now tomake clear. Before we enter that trail of silence, however, there is a muchsimpler language, such as is implied in the whistle of a quail or the howl of awolf, which we must try as best we can to interpret. For unless our ears arekeen enough to distinguish between the food and hunting calls of an animal, orbetween bob-white's love note and the yodel that brings his scattered flocktogether, it will be idle for us to ask what message or impulse a mother wolfsends after a running cub when she lifts her head to look at him steadily, andhe checks his rush to return to her side as if she had made the murky woods echoto her assembly clamor.image [images/9781591438984_004.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_030.jpg]IITHE simplest or most obvious method of animal communication is by inarticulatecries, expressive of hunger, loneliness, anger, pleasure, and other primal needsor emotions. The wild creatures are mostly silent, and so is the bulk of their\"talk,\" I think; but they frequently raise their voice in the morning or eveningtwilight, and by observing them attentively at such a time you may measure theeffect of their so-called language. Thus, you see plainly that to one call theanimal cocks his ear and gives answer; at another call he becomes wildlyexcited; a third passes over him without visible result; a fourth sets his feetin motion toward the sound or else sends him flying away from it, according toits message or import.That animal cries have a meaning is, therefore, beyond serious doubt; butwhether they have, like our simplest words, any definite or unchanging value isstill a question, the probable answer being \"No,\" since a word is the symbol ofa thought or an idea; but animals live in a world of emotion, and even our humanemotions are mostly dumb or inarticulate. I must give this negative answer,notwithstanding the fact that I have learned to call various birds and beasts,and that I can meet Hotspur's challenge on hearing Glendower boast that he cancall spirits from the vasty deep:Why, so can I, or so can any man;But will they come when you do call for them?Yes, the birds and beasts will surely come if you know how to give the rightcall; but I am still doubtful whether among themselves their audible cries areever quite so intelligible as is their silence.This question of animal speech has received a different and more positiveanswer, by the way, from a man who has spent many years in persistentobservation of wild apes and monkeys. After watching the lively creatures fromhis cage in the jungle, attracting them by means of various fruits and recordingtheir jabber in a phonograph, he claims to have discovered the monkey words forfood, water, danger and other elementary matters. Moreover, when his phonographrepeats these simian words the monkeys of another locality seem to understandthem, since they run to the proper dish at the word \"food\" or show evident signsof alarm at the word \"danger.\"It is doubtless much easier to deny such a conclusion than to prove or disproveit; but denial is commonly the first refuge of ignorance and the last ofdogmatism, and with these we are not concerned. I do not know whether Garnerclaims too much or too little for his monkeys; I have never had opportunity totest the matter in the jungle, and the caged monkeys with which I haveoccasionally experimented are too debased of habit or too imbecile in theiraffections to interest one who has long dealt with clean wild brutes. At times,however, when I have watched a monkey with an organ-grinder, I have noticed thatthe unhappy little beast displays a lively interest in the chitter ofchimney-swifts—a lingo which to my dull ears sounds remarkably like monkey-talk.But that is a mere impression, momentary and of little value; while Garnerspeaks soberly after long and immensely patient observation.To return to first-hand evidence: among wild creatures of my acquaintance thecrows come nearer than any others to something remotely akin to human speech.Several times I have known a tame crow to learn a few of our words and, what ismuch more significant, to show his superiority over parrots and other meremimics by using one or more of the words intelligently. There was one crow, forexample, that would repeat the word \"hungry\" in guttural fashion whenever hethought it was time for him to dine. He used this word very frequently when hisdinner or supper hour drew nigh, giving me the impression, since he did notconfuse it with two other words of his vocabulary, that he associated the wordwith the notion of food or of eating; and if this impression be true to fact, itindicates more than appears on the surface. We shall come to the wild crows andtheir \"talk\" presently; the point here is, that if this bird could use a newhuman word in association with a primal need, there is nothing to prevent himfrom using a sound or symbol of his own in the same way. In other words, he musthave some small faculty of language.Another tame crow, which an imaginative boy named Pharaoh Necho because of hishippety-hop walk, proved himself inordinately fond of games, play, socialgatherings of every kind. To excitement from any source, whether bird or bruteor human, he was as responsive as a weather-vane; but his play ran mostly tomischief, or to something that looked like joking, since he could never see acontemplative cat or a litter of sleepy little pigs without going out of his wayto tweak a tail and stir up trouble. At times he would watch, keeping out ofsight in a leafy tree or on the roof of the veranda, till Tabby, the house cat,came out and sat looking over the yard, her tail stretched out behind her. Ifshe lay down to sleep, or sat with tail curled snugly around her forepaws, shewas never molested; but the moment her tail was out of her sight and mind Nechosaw the chance for which he had apparently been waiting. Gliding noiselesslydown behind the unconscious cat he would tiptoe up and hammer the projectingtail with his beak. It was a startling blow, and at the loud squall or spittingjump that followed he would fly off, \"chuckling\" immoderately.When Necho saw or heard a gang of boys assembled he would neglect even hisdinner to join them; and presently, without ever having been taught, heannounced himself master of a new art by yelling, \"Yahoo! Come on!\" which wasthe rallying-cry of the clan in that neighborhood. He said this in ludicrousfashion, but unmistakably to those who knew him. Sometimes he would croak thewords softly to himself, as if mem0rizing them or pleased at the sound; but forthe most part he waited till boys were gathering for a swim or a ball game, whenhe would launch himself into flight and go skimming down the road, whooping outhis new cry exultantly. What meaning he attached to the words, whether of boysor fun or mere excitement, I have no means of knowing.After learning this much of our speech Necho took to the wild, following a callof the blood, I think; for it was springtime when he disappeared, and the crows'mating clamor sounded from every woodland. These birds are said to kill everymember of their tribe who returns to them after living with men, and the sayingmay have some truth in it. I have noticed that many tame crows are like tamebaboons in that they seem mortally afraid of their wild kinsmen; but Necho wasapparently an exception. If he had any trouble when first he returned to hisflock, the matter was settled without our knowledge, and during the followingautumn there was evidence that he was again in good standing. Long afterward, asI roamed the woods, I might hear his lusty \"Ya-hoo! Come on!\" from where he leda yelling rabble of crows to chivvy a sleeping owl or jeer at a running fox; andoccasionally his guttural cry sounded over the tree-tops when I could not seehim or know what mischief was afoot. He never returned to the house, and neveragain joined our play or allowed a boy to come near him.Not all crows have this \"gift of speech\"; and the fact that one tame crow learnsto use a few English words, while five or six others hold fast to their ownlingo, has led to the curious belief that, if you want to make a crow talk, youmust split his tongue. How such a belief originated is a mystery; but it was sofixed and so widespread when I was a boy that no sooner was a young crow takenfrom a nest than jack-knives were sharpened, and the leathery end of the crow'stongue was solemnly split after grave debate whether a seventh or a third partwas the proper medicine. If the crow talked after that, it was proof positivethat the belief was true; and if he remained dumb, it was a sign that there wassomething wrong in the splitting; which is characteristic of a large part of ournatural-history reasoning. The debates I have heard or read on the\"unanswerable\" question of how a chipmunk digs a hole without leaving any earthabout the entrance (a question with the simplest kind of an answer) are mostlysuggestive of the split-tongue superstition of crow language.Of the tame crows I have chanced to observe, only a small proportion showed anytendency to repeat words; and these gifted ones are, I judge, the same crowsthat in a wild state may occasionally be heard whistling like a jay, or\"barking\" or \"hooting\" or making some other call which ordinary crows do not orcannot make, and which shows an individual talent of mimicry. This last, which Ihave repeatedly observed among wild crows, is a very different matter fromspeech; but from the fact that these mimics learn to use a few English wordsmore or less intelligently one might not be far wrong in concluding that everycrow has in his brain a small undeveloped nest of cells corresponding to our\"bump\" of language.A closer observation of the wild birds may confirm this possibility. Thus, whenyou hear a solitary crow in a tree-top crying, \"Haw! Haw!\" monotonously, dippinghis head or flirting his tail every time he repeats it, you may be sure thatsomewhere within range of his eye or voice a flock of his own kind are on theground, feeding. That this particular haw is a communication to his fellows,telling them that the sentinel is on watch and all is well, seems to me veryprobable. There are naturalists, I know, who ingeniously resolve the wholephenomenon into blind chance or accident; but that does not square very wellwith the intelligence of crow nature as I have observed it; nor does it explainthe fact that once, when I avoided the sentinel and crept near enough to shoottwo members of the flock he was supposedly guarding, the rest were no sooner outof danger than they whirled upon the recreant and beat him savagely to theground.If you are interested enough to approach any crowsentinel in a casual orindifferent kind of way (he will take alarm if you approach quickly ordirectly), you must note that his haw changes perceptibly while you are yet faroff It is no longer formal or monotonous; nor is it uttered with the same bodilyattitude, as your eyes plainly see. You would pronounce and spell the cryexactly as before (it should be written aw or haw, not caw, for there is noconsonant sound in it); but if your ears are keen, they will detect an entirelydifferent accent or inflection, as they detect different accents and meaningswhen a sailor's casual or vibrant \"Sail ho!\" sings down from the crow-nest of aship. Now run a few steps toward the sentinel, or pretend to hide and creep, andinstantly the haw changes again. This time the accent is sharper even to yourdull ears; and hardly is the cry uttered when all the crows of the unseen flockwhirl into sight, heading swiftly away to the woods and safety.Apparently, therefore, this simple haw of the crow is like a root word ofcertain ancient languages, the Chinese, for example, which has several differentintonations to express different ideas, but which all sound alike to foreignears, and which are spelled alike when they appear in foreign print. To judge bythe crows' action, it is certain that their elementary haw has at least threedistinct accents to express as many different meaning: one of \"all's well\"another of \"watch out,\" and a third of \"be off!\" Moreover, the birds seem tounderstand these different meanings as clearly as we understand plain English;they feed quietly while haw means one thing, or spring aloft when it meansanother; and though you watch them a lifetime you will see nothing to indicatethat there is any doubt or confusion in their minds as to the sentinel'smessage.Not only the crows, but the wild ducks as well, and the deer and the fox andmany other creatures, seem to understand crow-talk perfectly, or at least a partof it which concerns their own welfare. Thus, on the seacoast in winter you hearthe crows hawing continually as they follow the tide-line in search of food. Forhours this talk goes on, loudly or sleepily, and the wild ducks pay absolutelyno attention to it; though they must know well that hungry crows will kill awounded or careless duck and eat him to the bones whenever they have a chance.Because of this dangerous propensity you would naturally expect the waterfowl tobe suspicious of the black freebooter and to be alert when they see or hear him;but no sooner do you begin to hunt with a gun than you learn a thing to make yourespect the crow, and perhaps to make you wonder how much or how very little youknow of the ways of the wood folk.Many of the ducks, the black or dusky mallards especially, like to come ashoreevery day in a secluded spot under the lee of a bank, there to rest or preen ortake a quiet nap in company. It is a tempting sight to see a score or a hundredof the splendid birds in a close group, their heads mostly tucked under theirwings; but it is practically impossible to stalk them, for the reason that thecrows are forever ranging the shore, and a crow never passes a group of sleepingducks without lifting his flight to take a look over the bank behind them. Whathis motive is no man can say; we only note that, in effect, he stands sentinelfor the ducks against a common enemy, as he habitually does for his own kind.There is no escaping that keen, searching glance of his; he sees you creepingthrough the beach-grass or hiding behind a bush. He flings out a single haw!with warning, danger, derision in it; and now the same ducks that have heard himall day without concern spring aloft on the instant and head swiftly out to sea.The crows have several other variations of the same cry, expressive of othermatters, which all the tribe seem to understand clearly, but which aremeaningless to human ears. When I imitate the distress-call of a young crow, forexample, I can bring a flock over my head at almost any time, the only conditionbeing that I keep well concealed. At the first glimpse of a man in hiding theysheer off, and it is seldom that I can bring them back a second time to the samespot; yet I have a companion, one who utters a call very much like mine toordinary ears, who can bring the flock back to him even after they have seen himand suffered at his hands. More than once I have stood beside him in the woodsand fired a gun repeatedly, killing a crow and scattering the flock pell-mell atevery shot; but no sooner does he begin to talk crow-talk than back they comeagain. What he says to them that I do not or cannot say is something that onlythe crows understand.It is commonly assumed that they come to such a call because they hear in it acry for help from one of their own kind. That is undoubtedly true at times; fora help-call, especially from a cub or nestling, is a summons to which mostanimals and birds instinctively respond. And, strangely enough, the smaller theyare the braver they seem to be. A mother-partridge has more than once flown inmy face or beaten me with her wings, while \"fierce\" hawks, owls and eagles havemerely circled around me at a safe distance when I came near their young. In themajority of cases, however, I think that birds come to a distress-call simplybecause the excitement of an individual spreads to all creatures within sight orhearing, just as a crowd of men or women will become excited and rush to acommon center before they know what the stir is all about.In confirmation of this theory, it is not necessary to cry like a distressedyoung crow to bring a flock over your head. The imitated hawing of an old crowwill do quite as well, if you throw the proper excitement into it. Again, on anysummer day you will hear in your own yard the pip-pip of arriving or departingrobins. The same call is uttered by both sexes, at all times and in all places;yet if you listen closely you must note that there is immense variety in theaccent or inflection of even this simple sound. The call is clear, ringing,joyous when the robins first arrive in the spring; it is subdued when theygather for the autumn flight; it is sleepy or querulous when they stand full-fedby the nest, and most business-like when they launch themselves into flight,which is the moment when you are most sure to hear it. A robin utters this callhundreds of times every day, in one accent or another, and neither the otherrobins nor their feathered neighbors seem to pay any attention to it; but when ared squirrel comes plundering a nest, and the mother robin sends forth the samepip-pip with a different intonation, then the response is instantaneous. Thealarm spreads swiftly over wood and field; clamor uprises, and birds of manyspecies come rushing in from all directions; not because they have heard thatMeeko is again killing young robins (at least, it does not seem so to me), butbecause excitement is afoot, and they are bound to join it or find out about itbefore they can settle down comfortably to their own affairs.There is an interesting way by which you may test this contagion of excitementfor yourself Hide at the edge of the woods or in any other bird neighborhood inthe early morning, preferably at a season when every nest has eggs or fledglingsin it; press two fingers against your lips and draw the breath sharply betweenthem, repeating the squeaky cry as rapidly as possible. The sound has apeculiarly exciting quality even to human ears (twice have I seen men run wildlyto answer it), and birds come to it as boys to a fire alarm. In a few momentsyou may have them streaming in from the four quarters of bird world, all highlyexcited, and perhaps all ready to protect some innocent nest from snake or crowor squirrel. Because the response is most electric at the season when fledglingsare most helpless, you are apt to think that this call of yours is mistaken bymother birds for a cry for help. That may be true; but be not too sure about it.The fledglings themselves will come almost as readily to the call when thenesting season is over and gone.I have tried that same exciting summons in many places, wild or settled, andcommonly but not invariably with the same result, as if it were a word from theuniversal bird language. Once in a secluded valley of northern Italy I saw ahunter with his gun, and promptly forgot my own errand in order to chum with himand find out what he had learned of the wood folk. He was hunting birds to eat.\"Those birds there!\" he said, pointing to a passing flock which I did notrecognize, but which seemed pitifully small game to me. Presently I learned thathe could not shoot flying, and was having such bad luck that, he said, the devilsurely had a hand in it. He was a smiling, companionable loafer, and for a timeI tagged after him, watching him amusedly as he made careful but vain stalks oflittle birds that seemed to have been made wild by much hunting. In a spirit ofthoughtless curiosity, and perhaps also to test bird nature in a strange land, Iinvited the hunter to hide with me in a thicket while I gave the call which hadso often brought the feathered folk of my own New England woods. At my cry awisp of birds whirled in to light at the edge of the covert; the Italian's gunroared; and then I discovered that the wretch was killing skylarks.I have since had many an uncomfortable moment at the thought of how many lovelysongsters may have paid with their lives for that ungodly experiment; for mycompanion hailed me as a master Nimrod from the New World; and when I refused,on the plea of bad luck, to teach him the call, I heard him give a distressinglygood imitation of it. Yet the experiment seemed to prove that everywhere birdsquickly catch the contagion of excitement; that in many cases they respond to acall because it stirs their anger or curiosity rather than because it conveysany definite summons for help or warning of danger.When you open your ears among the beasts you hear precisely the same story; thatis, certain cries apparently have definite meaning, like the accented haw of acrow, while others convey and also spread a wild emotion. Of all beasts, thewolves are perhaps the keenest, the most intelligent, and these seem to havedefinite calls for food or help or hunting or assembly. Such calls are strictlytribal, I think, like the dialects of Indians, since the call of a coyote isquite different from the call of a timber wolf even when both intend to conveythe same meaning. A friend of mine, an excellent mimic, who spent many years inthe West, has shot more than a score of coyotes after drawing them within rangeby sending forth the food-call in winter; but though he knows also the food-callof the timber wolf, he has never once deceived these larger brutes by hisimitation of it; nor has he ever seen a wolf of one species respond to the foodor hunting call of another.Like most other wild animals, timid or savage, the sensitive wolves all respond,but much more warily than the birds, to almost any inarticulate cry expressiveof emotional excitement; just as your dog, who is yesterday's wolf, grows uneasywhen you whine in your nose like a distressed puppy, or leaps up, ready to flyout of door or window, when a wild ki-yi breaks out in the distance. Indeed, itis easier to keep a boy from a fire than a dog from a crowd or excitement of anykind; and the same is true of their wild relatives, though the wariness of thelatter keeps them hidden where you cannot follow their action. The greatestcommotion I ever witnessed in a timberwolf pack was occasioned by the moaninghowl of a wounded wolf on a frozen lake in midwinter. It was a cry utterlyunlike anything I had ever recorded up to that time, and every time they heardit the grim beasts ran wildly here and there, howling like lunatics. Then, whenthe wounded one grew quiet, they would approach and sniff him all over; afterwhich some would sit on their tails and watch him closely, while others circledabout on the ice, using their noses like hounds in search of a lost trail.Occasionally, when I have had these uncanny brutes near me in the North, I havetried to call them or make them answer by giving what seemed to me a very goodimitation of their cries; but seldom has a howl of mine been returned. On thecontrary, the brutes almost always stop their howling whenever I begin to talkwolf-talk, as if they were listening and saying, \"What under the moon is thatnow?\" Then old Tomah, the Indian, comes out of his blanket and gives a howlexactly like mine, but with something in it which I cannot fathom or master, andinstantly from the snowfilled woods comes back the wild wolf answer.Likewise, I have called moose in many different localities, and am persuadedthat it makes very little difference what kind of whine or grunt or bellow youutter, since anything resembling a moose-call will do the trick if you know howto put the proper feeling into your voice. After listening carefully to manycallers, I note this characteristic difference: that one man invariably makesthe game wary, suspicious, fearful, no matter how finely he calls; while anotherin the same place, with the same trumpet and apparently with the same call,manages to put something into his voice, something primal, emotional andessentially animal, which brings a bull moose hurriedly to investigate. Thus ithappens that the worst caller I ever heard—worst in that he had no sense, nocunning, no knowledge of moose habits, and uttered a blatant, monstrous roarunlike anything a sane man ever heard in the heavens above or the earthbeneath—was still the most successful in getting his game into the open. Threenights in succession I heard him call in a region where moose were over-shy frommuch hunting, and where my own imitation of the animal's natural voice broughtsmall response. In that time fourteen bulls answered him, all that were withinhearing, I think; and everyone of the great brutes threw caution to the dogs andcame out on the jump.From such observations, and from others which I have not chronicled, I judgethat the higher orders of birds and beasts have a few calls which stand fordefinite things, or mental images of things, but that their ordinary criesmerely project an emotion or excitement in such a way that it stirs a similaremotion in other birds or beasts of the same species; just as the sound ofhearty laughter invariably stirs the feeling of mirth in men who hear it, or anyinarticulate cry of fear sets human feet in motion—toward the cry if the hearerbe brave, or away from it if he be of cowardly disposition. Yet even among men,who by civilization have lost some of their natural virtues, the primal impulsestill lives. Like the wolf or the raccoon, the man's first impulse is to rush tohis distressed or excited fellows. If he turns and runs the other way, it meanssimply that his artificial habit or training has deadened his natural instincts.In speaking of \"man\" here I refer to the genus homo, not to the male specimenthereof. Among brutes most of the natural instincts are the same in both sexes;they vary in degree, not in kind, and the instincts of the female are commonlythe stronger or keener. Yet I have noticed, or think I have noticed, thisdifference: when a cry of distress is uttered in the woods, the first bird orbeast to appear is almost always a female; but the male is quicker on his toesat a battle-yell or a senseless clamor.This last is a personal impression, and cannot well be verified. The only recordI have which might pass for evidence in the matter comes from my observation ofthe crows. In the spring many of these questionable birds indulge their tastefor eggs or tender flesh and soon become incurable nest-robbers; and for thatreason I often shoot them, to save other and more useful birds. The method isvery simple: one hides and calls, and takes the crows as they appear in swiftflight, the number shot being commonly limited to one or two at a time. And Ihave observed repeatedly, at different times and in different localities, thatwhen I use the distress-call of a young crow as a decoy, the first to appearover the tree-tops is a female. This is the common rule, with occasionalexceptions to point or emphasize it. But whenever I clamor like a crow that hasdiscovered an owl, or send forth a senselessly excited hawing, almost invariablythe first crow to come whooping over is a long-winged and glossy old male.Does it seem to you like thoughtless barbarity on my part to kill crows in thisfashion? Perhaps it is barbarous; I do not quite know; but it certainly is notthoughtless. One cannot blame the crows for their taste in eggs or nestlings;but one must note that they destroy an enormous number of insectivorous birds,and that the harm they do in this respect outweighs their usefulness indestroying field-mice and beetles. I write this with regret; for I admire thecrow, and consider him as, of all birds, the most intelligent and the mostconsiderate of his own kind. I know that it is a moot question whether the crowdoes more harm or good, and that some naturalists have settled it in his favor;but I have too often caught him plundering nests in the springtime to be muchimpressed by his alleged usefulness at other seasons. I think that he may havebeen once useful in preserving the so-called balance of nature; but that balanceis now dangerously unequal. The crow has flourished even in well-settledregions, thanks to his superior wit, while other useful birds have fearfullydiminished, and this at a time when our orchards and gardens call more and moreinsistently for their help. Because of his disproportionate numbers the crow nowappears to me, like our destructive and useless cats, as a positive menace in acountry where he once occupied a modest or inconspicuous place—such a place ashe still occupies in the wilderness, where I meet him but rarely, and where I amglad to leave him in peace, since he does not seriously interfere with his morebeautiful or more useful neighbors. But we are wandering from the dim trail ofanimal communication' which we set out to follow.The inarticulate but variously accented cries of which we have spoken constitutethe only animal language to which our naturalists have thus far paid anyattention; and doubtless some of them would object to the use of the word\"language\" in such a connection. In all matters of real natural history, however(real, that is, in the sense of dealing at first hand with individual birds orbeasts), I am much more inclined to listen to old Tomah, who says, when I askhim whether animals can talk: \"Talk? Course he kin talk! Eve'ting talk in heesown way. Hear me now make-um dat young owl talk.\" And, stepping outside thecircle of camp-fire light, Tomah utters a hoot, which is answered at a distanceevery time he tries it. After parleying with the stranger in this tentativefashion, Tomah sends forth a different call; and immediately, as if in readyacceptance of an invitation, a barred owl glides like a gray shadow into a treeover our heads. I have heard that same old Indian use horned-owl talk, wolf andbeaver and woodpecker talk, and several other dialects of the wood folk, in thesame fascinating and convincing way.One must judge, therefore, that most cries of the day or night have theirmeaning, if only one knows how to hear them; yet they constitute but a part, andprobably a very small part, of the animal's habitual communication with hisfellows. The bulk of it appears to be of that silent kind which passed betweenDon and Nip, and which, I have reason to believe, is the common language of thewhole animal kingdom.To prove such a matter is plainly impossible. Even to investigate it frankly isto enter a shadowy realm between the conscious and subconscious states, where noprocess can be precisely followed, and where the liability to error is alwayspresent. Let us therefore begin on familiar ground by examining certainphenomena which we cannot explain, to be sure, but which have been observedfrequently enough to give us confidence that we are dealing with realities. Irefer especially to that curious warning or \"feeling\" of impending danger, whichis supposed (erroneously, I think) to depend upon the so-called sixth sense ofanimals and men.image [images/9781591438984_005.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_031.jpg]IIIFOR the word chumfo I am indebted to a tribe of savages living near Lake Mweru,in Africa, and am grateful to them not only for naming a thing which has no namein any civilized language, but also for an explanation of its function in theanimal economy. We shall come to the definition of the word presently, after wehave some clear notion of the thing for which the word stands. As Thomas àKempis says, if I remember correctly, \"It is better to feel compassion than toknow how to define it.\"By way of approach to our subject, let it be understood that chumfo refers in ageneral way to the animal's extraordinary powers of sense perception, which Iwould call his \"sensibility\" had not our novelists bedeviled that good word bymaking it the symbol of a false or artificial emotionalism. Every wild creatureis finely \"sensible\" in the true meaning of the word, his sensitiveness beingdue to the fact that there is nothing dead or even asleep in nature; the naturalanimal or the natural man is from head to foot wholly alive and awake. And thisbecause every atom of him, or every cell, as a biologist might insist, is ofitself sentient and has the faculty of perception. Not till you understand thatfirst principle of chumfo will your natural history be more than a dry husk, athing of books or museums or stuffed skins or Latin names, from which all livinginterest has departed.I am sometimes asked, \"What is the most interesting thing you find in thewoods?\" the question calling, no doubt, for the name of some bird or beast oranimal habit that may challenge our ignorance or stir our wonder. The answer is,that whether you search the wood or the city or the universe, the onlyinteresting thing you will ever find anywhere is the thrill and mystery ofawakening life. That the animal is alive, and alive in a way you ought to be butare not, is the last and most fascinating discovery you are likely to make innature's kingdom. After years of intimate observation, I can hardly meet a wildbird or beast even now without renewed wonder at his aliveness, his instantresponse to every delicate impression, as if each moment brought a new messagefrom earth or heaven and he must not miss it or the consequent enjoyment of hisown sensations. The very sleep of an animal, when he seems ever on the thin edgeof waking, when he is still so in touch with his changing world that theslightest strange sound or smell or vibration brings him to his feet with everysense alert and every muscle ready,—all this is an occasion of marvel to dullmen, who must be called twice to breakfast, or who meet the violent clamor of analarm clock with the drowsy refrain:Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,A little more folding of the hands to sleep!You will better understand what I mean by the animal's aliveness, his uncloyingpleasure in the sensation of living, if you can forget any tragical theories orprejudices of animal life which you have chanced to read, and then franklyobserve the first untrammeled creature you meet in the outdoor world. Here atyour back door, for example, is a flock of birds that come trooping from thesnowy woods to your winter feast of crumbs. See how they dart hither and yonbetween mouthfuls, as if living creatures could not be still or content withanyone thing, even a good thing, in a world of endless variety. Look again, moreclosely, and see how they merely taste of the abundance on your table, andstraightway leave it for a morsel that the wind blows from under their beaks,and that they are bound to have if it takes all winter. Every other minute theyflit to a branch above the table, look about alertly, measure the world oncemore, make sure of the dog that he is asleep, and of the sky that it holds nohawk; then they wipe their bills carefully, using a twig for a napkin, and downto the table they go to begin all over again. So every bite is for them a feastrenewed, a feast with all the spices of the new, the fresh, the unexpected andthe adventurous in it.Or again, when you enter the wilderness remote from men, here is a deer slippingshadow-like through the shadowy twilight, daintily tasting twenty varieties offood in as many minutes, and keeping tabs on every living or moving or growingthing while she eats; or a fox, which seems to float along like thistle-down inthe wind, halting, listening, testing the air-smells as one would appreciate avaried landscape, playing Columbus to every nook or brush-pile and finding in itsomething that no explorer ever found before. Such is the natural way of a fox,which makes a devious trail because so many different odors attract him here orthere.In fine, to watch any free wild creature is to understand the singing lines from\"Saul\":How good is man's life, the mere living, how fit to employAll the heart and the soul and the senses forever in joy!It is to understand also the spirit of Browning, who is hardly a world poet, tobe sure, but who has the distinction of being the only famous poet who is alwaysalive and awake. Homer nods; Dante despairs and mourns; Shakespeare has a longperiod of gloom when he can write only terrible tragedies of human failure;other great poets have their weary days or melancholy hours, but Browning singsever a song of abounding life. Even his last, the Epilogue to \"Asolando,\" is nota swan-song, like Tennyson's; it is rather a bugle-call, and it sounds not the\"taps\" of earth, but the \"reveille\" of immortality. But we are wandering fromour woodsy trail.Those who make an ornithology of mere feathers, or who imagine they know ananimal because they know what the scientists have said about him, see in thisinstant responsiveness of the wild creature only a manifestation of fear, andalmost every book of birds or beasts repeats the story of terror and tragedy.Yet every writer of such books probably owns a dog that displays in less degree(because he is less alive) every single symptom of the wild creature, includinghis alleged fears; and the dog, far from leading a tragic or terror-governedlife, is hilariously disposed to make an adventure or a picnic of every newexcursion afield. Moreover, if one of these portrayers of animal fears ortragedies has ever had an adventure of his own; if he has penetrated a wildregion on tiptoe, or run the white rapids in a canoe, or heard the wind sing inhis ears on a breakneck gallop across country, or trailed a bear to his covert,or hunted bandits in the open, or followed the bugles when they blew forwar,—then he must know well that these unforgettable moments, when a man'ssenses all awaken and his nerves tingle and he treads the earth like a buck inspring, are the only times in a man's dull life when he feels himself whollyalive and a man. That a naturalist should forget this when he sees an alert wildanimal, and deny his dog and his own experience of life by confounding alertnesswith fear, is probably due not so much to his own blindness as to his borrowednotions, such as the \"struggle for existence,\" the \"reign of terror,\" and otherhallucinations which have been packed into his head in the name of science ornatural history.Just to take a walk with your dog may be a revelation to you, as most simplematters are when you dare to view them for yourself without prejudice. In fact,what is any revelation or discovery but seeing things as they are? This dailywalk over familiar ground, which bores you because you must take it forexercise, leaving out of it the fun which is the essential element of anyexercise, is to your dog another joyous and expectant exploration of the Indes.He explored the same ground yesterday, to be sure, but all sorts of revolutionsand migrations take place overnight; and if he be a real dog, not a spoiled pet,he will uncover more surprises on the familiar road than you uncover in themorning newspaper. Follow him sympathetically as he finds endlessly interestingthings where you find little but boredom, and you may learn that there are threemarked differences between you and a normal animal: first, that he keeps thespirit of play, which you have well-nigh lost; second, that he lives in hissensations and is happy, while you dwell mostly in your thoughts and postponehappiness for the future; and third, that he is alive now, every moment, and youused to be alive the day before yesterday.In all this you are simply typical of our unnatural civilization, which beginsto enumerate or describe us as so many thousand \"souls,\" doubtless because everysingle body of us is moribund or asleep. Consider our noses, for example. Theyare the seat of a wonderful faculty, more dependable than sight or hearing; theyare capable of giving us sensations more varied than those of color, and almostas enjoyable as those of harmony; they can be easily trained so as to recognizeevery tree and plant and growing thing by its delicate fragrance; they would addgreatly to our safety and convenience, as well as to our enjoyment, did we usethem as nature intended; yet so thoroughly neglected are they, as a rule, thatit takes a burning rag or a jet of escaping coal-gas to rouse them to theimmense and varied world of odors in which an animal lives continually.At present I am the alleged owner of a young setter, Rab, who has reached thestage of development when he thinks he owns me. For after you have properlytrained a dog, there comes a brief time when he discovers with joy that he canmake you do things for him; and then he is like a child who discovers that hecan make you talk (that is, show some sign of life) by asking you questions. Andthis young setter has, I am convinced, a very low opinion of human aliveness,since there is never a day when he does not give me a hint that he considers mea poor cripple—excepting, perhaps, the rare days when I take himwoodcock-hunting, when he mildly approves of me.One night, after waiting a long time at my feet till I should become animate,Rab followed me hopefully into the dark kitchen, where he had never before beenallowed to go. I heard his steps behind me only as far as the door, and thoughthe was afraid to enter; but when I turned on the light, there he stood in thedoorway, \"frozen\" into a beautiful point, his head upturned to a bell andbattery on the wall. Presently a mouse hopped from the battery into awaste-basket on the floor, and Rab pointed the thing stanchly, his whole bodyquivering with delight when a faint odor stole to his nostrils or a rustle ofpaper to his ears. From the basket the mouse streaked to the coal-hod, and Rabpointed that, too, and then a crack under a door, and a yawning closet drawer.\"My bones!\" he said, trying to claw the drawer open. \"This is a good place;something is alive here!\" Then he came over and sat in front of me, looking upin my face, his head twisted sideways, to demand why I had so long kept him outof the only part of the house that was not wholly dormant.Though the adventure was twelve months ago, \"age cannot wither it, nor customstale its infinite variety,\" for every night Rab comes to me where I am reading,nudges my elbow, paws my book, sits in front of me to yawn hugely, gives me nopeace, in short, till I follow him to the kitchen for another go at thewaste-basket, the coal-hod and all the closet drawers. It is of no avail toleave the doors open; he will not go unless I join him in the enjoyment ofsomething that lives. A short time since we flushed another mouse in the cellar,whither he followed me to look after the furnace; and now he pesters me by dayas well as by night whenever he finds me, as he thinks, wrapped in unmanlylethargy.With all his vivacity this young setter, who seems so alert among mere men,becomes a dull creature the moment you compare him with his wild kindred. Hecannot begin to interpret the world through his senses as they instantlyinterpret it, and he would starve to death where they live on the fat of theland. Once on a forest trail I came upon him pointing stanchly at the edge of alittle opening that lumbermen had made for yarding logs. Just across theopening, where a jumper road joined the yard, stood a noble buck, and he was\"pointing,\" too, for he was face to face with such a creature as he had neverbefore seen. Both animals were like statues, so motionless did they stand; butthere was this difference, that the dog rested solidly on earth and might havebeen carved from marble, while the buck seemed to rest on air and to becompounded of some ethereal essence. His eyes fairly radiated light and color.The velvet on his antlers seemed to grow as I looked upon it, like the velvetmoss in which the fairies are said to rest. Every hair of him from nose to tailtip was gloriously alive. A moment only he stood, but long enough for me tocarry a picture of him forever afterward; then he bounded up the old road, andRab came running over to ask me what new thing he had discovered.This marvelous alertness of the natural animal is commonly attributed to thefact that his physical senses are more acute than ours; but that is true only ofsome particular sense of a certain creature. The wolf's nose, the deer's ear,the vulture's eye,—these are probably keener than any similar human organ; but,on the other hand, a man's eye is very much keener for details than the eye ofwolf or deer; his senses of touch and taste are finer than anything to be foundamong the lower orders, and the average of his five senses is probably thehighest upon earth. Yet the animal is more responsive to impressions of theexternal world, and this is due, I think, to the fact that he lives more in hissensations; that he is not cumbered, as we are, by inner phenomena; that he isfree from pain, care, fear, regret, anxiety and other mental complexities; thathe is accustomed to hear (that is, to receive vibrations) through his feet orhis skin quite as much as through his ears; and that his whole body, relaxed andat ease, often becomes a first-class receiving instrument for what we call senseimpressions.As an example of this last, note the wild creature's response to every change ofair pressure, a response so immediate and certain that one might accuratelyforestall the barometer by observing the action of birds, or even of chickens,which anticipate a storm long before your face has noted the moist wind or youreye the rain-cloud. In the winter woods I have often seen a deer feedinggreedily (quite at variance with his usual dainty tasting) at an hour longbefore or long after his accustomed time, and as I traveled wider I would findother deer doing the same thing. I used to wonder at this, till I noticed thatsuch unusual action was always followed by a storm—not an ordinary briefsnowfall, to which deer pay little attention beyond seeking shelter while itlasts, but a severe storm or blizzard, during which most animals lie quiet for awhole day, or even two or three days, without stirring abroad for food.Whether an element of forethought enters into this act of \"stuffing\" themselvesbefore a storm, or whether it is wholly instinctive, like the bear's change ofdiet before he dens for his winter sleep, is a question which does not concernus, since nobody can answer it. In either case the deer have felt, as surely asour most sensitive instruments, not only the decreasing pressure of the air butalso its increasing moisture.That such sensitiveness is not of anyone organ, but rather of the whole body,becomes more evident when we study the lower orders—fishes, for example, whichmay winter under a dozen fathoms of water and a two foot blanket of ice, butwhich nevertheless respond to the changing air currents far above their heads.Once on a northern lake, in March, I kept tabs on some trout for fourteenconsecutive days, and it seemed that they moved from deep to shallow water orback again whenever the wind veered to the proper quarter. I had a water-holecut in the thick ice, and, finding a trout under it one day, I kept a couple oflines with minnows there constantly. The hole was in a shallow place, over asandy bottom, and by putting my face to the opening, with a blanket over my headto exclude the upper light, I could dimly see the shadows move in from deepwater. On six scattering days, when the wind came light or strong from thesouth, two of the days bringing snow, the trout evidently moved shoreward, sinceI caught them abundantly, as many as I needed and some to spare; but on theother eight days, some clear and some stormy, when the wind was north of east orwest, not a trout was seen or caught, and only once was a minnow of minemissing.It may be said that the trout simply followed their food-supply; but I doubtthis, since trout apparently feed very little in winter; and in formulating anytheory of the matter one must account for the fact that big fish or little fishmoved shoreward whenever the wind blew south. The phenomenon may appear lessforeign to our experience, though not less mysterious to our reason, if weremember that an old wound or a corn may by its aching foretell a storm, or thata person suffering from nervous prostration may by his sudden depression knowthat the barometer will soon be falling.The same bodily sensitiveness appears unchanged in our domestic animals. I oncesaw a deer and her two fawns kneel down in the woods, and watched them inastonishment as they rested for some time on their knees, as if in supplication;then the ground rocked under me, and I knew that their feet had felt the tremorof an earthquake long before I was sensible of it. Such an observation seemedwonderful to me till I learned that our sheep are equally sensitive in theirelastic hoofs, and that our pigs respond not only to vibration of earth or air,but also to some finer vibration set in motion, apparently, by human excitement.Moreover, I have known one dog, old and half deaf, that, whether asleep orawake, would respond to the faint tremor of his master's automobile before itcame into sight or hearing. And what there is in the tremor of one machine todistinguish it from another of the same make and power is something that theunaided ear can hardly measure. The dog lived under a hilltop, on a highway overwhich scores of automobiles passed daily; and on holidays, when his master wasat home, the scores would increase to hundreds. He would sleep for hours on theveranda, paying no heed to the noise or smell or dust of the outrageous things,till suddenly he would jump up, bark, and start for the gate; and in a moment ortwo we would see the master's auto rise into sight over the brow of the hill.image [images/9781591438984_006.jpg]The instant response of deer or dog to minute external impressions, thoughstartling enough, is probably wholly physical, a matter of vibrations on oneside and of nerves on the other; but there are other phenomena of sensitiveness(and these bring us nearer to our trail of animal communication) for which it ismuch harder to find a satisfactory physical explanation. Such is the feeling orwarning of unsensed danger, or the premonition that some one unseen and unheardis approaching—a phenomenon which seems to be common among animals, to judgefrom repeated observation, and which appears often enough in human beings tomake not only the inquisitive Society for Psychical Research but almost everythoughtful man or woman take some note of it.For example, a man awake in his bed sees his son, whom he thinks safely ashorein a foreign country, fall overboard from a steamer to his death, at the veryhour when the son did fall overboard, as was afterward learned. Or a woman, thewife of a sea-captain, sitting on the veranda at home in the bright moonlight,sees the familiar earth vanish in a world of water, and looks suddenly upon herhusband's ship as it reels to the gale, turns over to the very edge ofdestruction, and then rights itself with half its crew swept overboard—and allthis while the precise event befell a thousand miles away. Such things, whichspell a different kind of sensitiveness from that with which we are familiar,have happened to people well known to me; but as they have happened to othersalso, and as almost every town or village has a convincing example of its own, Iforbear details and accept the fact, and try here to view or understand it as anatural phenomenon.At first you may strongly object even to my premise, calling it incredible thatsense-bound mortals should feel a danger that their eyes cannot see or theirears hear; but there are at least two reasonable answers to your objection. Inthe first place, we are sense-bound only in the sense of limiting ourselvesunnecessarily, confining our perception to five habitual modes, shamefullyneglecting to cultivate even these, and ignoring the use or the existence ofother and perhaps finer means of contact with the external world. Again, it isnot a whit more incredible that sensitive creatures, whether brute or human,should feel the coming or going of a person than that they should feel his lookor glance, as they certainly do.This last is no cloudy theory; it is a plain fact which endures the test ofobservation. Almost any man of strong personality can disturb or awaken asleeping wild animal simply by looking at him intently; and the nearer the manis the more certain the effect of his gaze on the sleeping brute. The same istrue in less degree of most Indians and woodsmen, and of many sensitive womenand children, as you may prove for yourself. Go into a room where a sensitive or\"high-strung\" person is taking a nap—not sleeping heavily, as most men sleep,but lightly, naturally, as all wild animals take their rest. Make no noise, butstand or sit quietly where you can look intently into the sleeper's face; andcommonly, by a change of position or a turning away of the head or a startledopening of the eyes, the sleeper will show that he feels your look and is tryingsubconsciously to avoid it. The awakening, whether of animals or of men, doesnot always follow our look, most fortunately, but it happens frequently enoughunder varying conditions to put the explanation of chance entirely out of thequestion.When I was a child I used to sit long hours in the woods alone, partly for loveof the breathing solitude, and partly for getting acquainted with wild birds orbeasts, which showed no fear of me when they found me quiet. At such times Ioften found within myself an impression which I expressed in the words,\"Something is watching you.\" Again and again, when nothing stirred in my sight,that curious warning would come; and almost invariably, on looking around, Iwould find some bird or fox or squirrel which had probably caught a slightmotion of my head and had halted his roaming to creep near and watch meinquisitively. As I grew older the \"feel\" of living things grew dimmer; yet manytimes in later years, when I have been in the wilderness alone, I haveexperienced the same impression of being watched or followed, and so often hasit proved a true warning that I still trust it and act upon it, even when myeyes see nothing unusual and my ears hear nothing but their own ringing in thesilence.I remember once, when I was sitting on the shore of a lake at twilight, that Ibegan to have an increasing impression that some living thing unseen was nearme. At first I neglected it, for I had my eyes on a deer that interested megreatly; but the feeling grew stronger till I obeyed it and rose to my feet. Atthe first motion came a startling woof! and from some bushes close behind me abear jumped away for the woods. No doubt he had been there some time, watchingme or creeping nearer, knowing that I was alive, but completely puzzled by myshapelessness and lack of action. A similar thing has happened several times, inother places and with other animals, and always at a moment when I was most inharmony with the environment and a sharer of its deep tranquility.*3[9781591438984_ftn.htm#ftn3]As a child this faculty (if such it be) was as natural as anything else in life;for in childhood we take the world as we find it in personal experience, andnothing is especially wonderful where all is wonder. I then thought no more offeeling the presence of an animal than of hearing him walk when I could not seehim; but as I grew older the experience seemed a little odd or \"queer,\" and Inever spoke of it to anyone till I discovered, first, that the faculty seems tobe common among animals, and second, that some Indians (not all) have it andregard it as the most natural thing in the world. Here is how the latterdiscovery came about:Simmo and I were calling moose from a lake one moonlit night, with a silentcanoe under us, dark evergreen woods at our back, and a little ghost of abeaver-meadow, vague, misty, shadow-filled, immediately before our eyes yetseeming as remote as any drifting cloud. To our repeated call no answer wasreturned; then we allowed the canoe to drift ashore where it would, and satlistening to the vast silence. I was brought back from my absorption in thefragrance, the harmony, the infinite stillness of the night by feeling the canoeshake and hearing Simmo whisper, \"Somet'ing near. Look out!\"Now in a silence like that, the tense, living silence of the wilderness atnight, one's ears are as full of tricks as a puckwudgie, who is one of themischievous fairy-folk of the Indians. The whine of a mosquito sounds across thewhole lake; or the mutter of a frog becomes like the roar of a bull of Bashan;or suddenly you begin to hear music as the faint vibration of some dry stub,purring in the unfelt air currents, turns to the booming of a mighty churchorgan. At such a time, unless one has trained his senses to ignore the obvious(the Indian secret of seeing and hearing things), one soon becomes confused,uncertain of the borderland between the real and the imaginary; so presently Iturned to Simmo and whispered, \"You hear him?\"The Indian shook his head. \"No hear-um; just feelum,\" he said; and again wesettled down to watch. For several minutes we questioned the woods, the lake,the meadow; but nothing stirred, not a sound broke the painful quiet, the whilewe both felt strongly that some living thing was near us. Then a shadow movedfrom the darker shadow of an upturned root, only a few yards away, and a greatbull stood alert on the open shore.I thought then, and I still think, that besides our ordinary five senses we havea finer faculty which I must call, for lack of a better term, the sense ofpresence; and I explain it on the assumption that every life recognizes andattracts every other life by some occult force, as dead matter (if there be sucha thing) attracts all other matter by the mysterious force of gravitation.Doubtless I have been many times watched in the woods when I did not know orfeel it; and certainly I have often had my eyes upon an unconscious bird orbeast when, though I fancied he grew uneasy under my scrutiny, he did not haveenough sense of danger to run away-possibly because no real danger threatenedhim, the eyes that looked upon him being friendly or merely curious.Once on a hardwood ridge I came upon a buck lying asleep in open timber, andstood with my back against a great sugar-maple, observing him for five or sixminutes before he stirred. No, I was not trying to awaken him by a look, or tostage any other experiment. I was simply enjoying a rare sight, noting withimmense interest that this wild creature, whom I had always seen so splendidlyalert, could nod and blink like any ordinary mortal. So near was he that I couldmark the drowsiness of his eyes, the position of his feet, the swelling of hissides as he breathed. I happened to be counting his respirations in friendlyfashion, comparing them with my own, when suddenly his head turned to me; hiseyes snapped wide open, and they were looking straight into mine. Apparently hisfeeling or subconscious perception had warned him where danger was; but stillhis eyes could not recognize it, standing there in plain sight. For to standmotionless without concealment is often the best way to deceive a wild animal,which habitually associates life with motion.No more drowsiness for that buck! He was startled, plainly enough; but he roseto his feet very stealthily, not stirring a leaf, and stood at tense attention.When he turned his head to look over his shoulder behind him I raised myfield-glass, for I wanted to read his thought, if possible, in his eyes. As heturned his gaze my way again his nose seemed to sweep my face. It rested there amoment full on the lens of my glass, moved on, and returned for a longerinspection. Then he glided past, still without recognizing me, testing the airat every springy step, harking this way, looking that way, and disappearing atlast as if he trod on eggs.From such experiences I judge that the feeling of unsensed danger, or the moresubtle feel of a living thing, is as variable in the animals as are theirinstincts or their social habits. It may be dull in one creature and keen inanother of the same species, or alternately awake and asleep in the samecreature; but there is no longer any doubt in my mind that it is a widespreadgift among birds and beasts. When it appears occasionally among men, therefore,it is to be regarded not as uncanny or queer, but, like the sure sense ofdirection which a few men possess, as a precious and perfectly naturalinheritance from our primitive ancestors. That it skips a dozen generations toalight on an odd man here or there, like a storm-driven bird on a ship at sea,is precisely what we might expect of heredity, which follows a course that seemsto us erratic or at times marvelous, as geometry appears to an Eskimo, becausewe do not yet understand its law or working principle.Among savage tribes, who live a natural outdoor life in close contact withnature, the perception of danger or of persons beyond the ordinary sense rangeis much more common than among civilized folk. Almost every explorer andmissionary who has spent much time with African natives, for example, hasnoticed that the Blacks have some mysterious means of knowing when a stranger isapproaching one of their villages—mysterious, that is, because it does notdepend on runners or messengers or any other of our habitual means ofcommunication. A recent observer of these people has at last offered anexplanation of the matter, with many other impressions of native philosophy, ina work to which he gives the suggestive title of Thinking Black. Of the scoresof books on Africa which I have read, this is the only one to show more than avery superficial knowledge of the natives, and the reason is apparent. Theauthor thinks, most reasonably, that you cannot possibly know the native orunderstand his customs until you know his thought, and that the only trail tohis thought is through the language in which the thought is expressed. Thereforedid he study the speech as a means of knowing the man; and herein he is inrefreshing contrast to other African travelers and hunters I have read, whospend a few months or weeks in a white man's camp, knowing the natives about asintimately as lovers know the moon, and then babble of native customs or beliefsor \"superstitions,\"—as if any rite or habit could be understood without firstunderstanding the philosophy of life from which it sprang, as a flower from ahidden seed.This rare observer, who knows how the native thinks because he perfectlyunderstands the native language, tells us*4 [9781591438984_ftn.htm#ftn4] thatthe Blacks clearly recognize the power of animals and of normal men to know manythings beyond their sense range; that they give it a definite name, and explainit in a way which indicates an astonishing degree of abstract thought on thepart of those whom we ignorantly call unthinking savages. According to thesenatives, every natural animal, man included, has the physical gifts of touch,sight, hearing, taste, smell, and chumfo. I must still use the native termbecause it cannot be translated, because it implies all that we mean byinstinct, intuitive or absolute knowledge and (a thing which no other psychologyhas even hinted at) the process by which such knowledge is acquired.This chumfo is not a sixth or extra sense, as we assume, but rather the unity orperfect co-ordination of the five senses at their highest point. I mayillustrate the matter this way, still following Crawford, whose record containsmany curious bits of observation, savage philosophy, woods lore and animal lore,many of them written by the camp-fire and all jumbled together pell-mell:For ordinary perception at near distances the eye or the ear is sufficient, andwhile engaged in any near or obvious matter the five senses work independently,each busy with its own function. But when such observation is ended or at fault,and the man retreats, as it were, into his inner self, then in the quiet all thesenses merge and harmonize into a single perfect instrument of perception.(Here, in native dress, is nothing more or less than the psychologist'ssubconscious self, with its mysterious working.) At such moments the wholeanimal or the whole man, not his brain and senses alone, becomes sensitive tothe most delicate impressions, to inaudible sounds or vibrations, to unseencolors, to unsmelled odors or intangible qualities,—to a multitude of subtlemessages. from the external world, which are ordinarily unnoticed because thesenses are ordinarily separate, each occupied with its particular message. Sowhen a sleeping animal is suddenly aware that he must be alert, he does notlearn of approaching danger through his ears or nose, but through chumfo,through the perfect co-ordination of all his senses working together as one. Inthe same way a wandering black man always knows where his hut or camp is; heholds his course on the darkest night, finds his way through a vast jungle, goesback to any spot in it where he left something, and often astonishes Africantravelers by getting wind of their doings while they are yet far distant.Such is the native philosophy; and the striking feature of it is, that it is notsuperstitious but keenly observant, not ignorant but rational and scientific,since it seems to anticipate our latest biological discoveries, or rather, as weshall see, a philosophy which rests upon biological science as a foundation.Perhaps the first suggestion that the native may have reason in his theory comesfrom the extraordinary sensitiveness of certain blind people, who walkconfidently about a cluttered room, or who sort the family linen after itreturns from the laundry. These blind people say, and think, that they avoidobjects by feeling the increasing air pressure as they approach, or that theysort the family linen by smell; but it appears more likely that a greater unityand refinement of all their senses results from their living in darkness.That our human senses have unused possibilities, or that we may possibly possessextra senses of which we are not conscious, may appear if you study thephenomenon of hearing, especially if you study it when you hear a strange soundin the woods or in the house at night. It is assumed that we always locate asound by the ear, and that we determine its volume or distance by our judgmentfrom previous experiences; but that, I think, is a secondary and not a primaryprocess. When we act most naturally we seem to locate a sound not by search orexperiment, but instantly, instinctively, absolutely; and then by our ear or ourjudgment we strive to verify our first chumfo impression.As a specific instance, you are lying half asleep at night when a faint, strangesound breaks in upon your consciousness. If you act naturally now, you will ninetimes out of ten locate the sound on the instant, without bringing your \"goodear\" to bear upon it; but if you neglect or lose your first impression, you mayhunt for an hour and go back to bed without finding the source of thedisturbance. Or you are traveling along a lonely lane at night, more alive thanyou commonly are, when a sudden cry breaks out of the darkness. It lasts but afraction of a second and is gone; yet in that fleeting instant you have learnedthree things: you know the direction of the cry; you know, though you neverheard it before, whether it is a loud cry from a distance or a faint cry fromnear at hand; and you are so sure of its exact location that you go to a certainspot, whether near or far, and say, \"That cry sounded here.\"So much if you act naturally; but if you depend on your ears or judgment, as menare apt to do, then you are in for a long chase before you locate the cry of abird or a beast or a lost child in the night.It is easy to make mistakes here, for we are so cumbered by artificial habitsthat it is difficult to follow any purely natural process; but our trail becomesclearer when we study the matter of hearing among the brutes. Thus, your dog islying asleep by the fire when a faint noise or footstep sounds outside.Sometimes, indeed, there is no audible sound at all when he springs to his feet;but no sooner is the door opened for him than he is around the house and away,heading as straight for the disturbance as if he knew, as he probably does,exactly where to find it. Yet your dog is, I repeat, a very dull creature incomparison with his wild kindred. Their ability to locate a sound is almostunbelievable, not because they have more delicate ears (for the human ear ismuch finer, being sensitive to a thousand inflections, tones, harmonies, whichare meaningless to the brute), but because of what the Blacks call their betterchumfo or what we thoughtlessly call their stronger instincts.This has been strongly impressed upon me at times when I have tried to call amoose in the wilderness. If you seek these animals far back where they are neverhunted—a difficult matter nowadays—the bulls answer readily enough, or sometimestoo readily, as when one big brute chased me to my canoe and gave me a hatlessrun for it; but in a much-hunted region they are very shy and come warily to acall. The best way to see them in such a place is to call a few times at night,or until you get an answer, and then go quickly away before the bull comes nearenough to begin circling suspiciously. At daybreak you are very apt to find himwaiting; and the astonishing thing is that he is waiting at the very spot whereyou used your trumpet.The place you select for calling may be a tiny bog in a vast forest, or alittle, nameless beaver-meadow by a lake or river. It is like many other suchplaces, near or far, and the bull may come from a distance, crossing lakes,rivers, bogs and dense forest on his way; but he never seems to make a mistakeor to be at a loss in locating the call. On a still night I have heard a bullanswer me from a mountain five or six miles away; yet in the morning there hewas, waiting expectantly for his mate near the bit of open shore where I hadcalled him; and to reach that spot he must either have crossed the lake byswimming, a distance of two miles, or else have circled it on a wide detour.That he should come such a distance through woods and waters, and pick the rightspot from a hundred others on either side, seems to me not a matter of ears orexperience but of chumfo, or absolute knowledge.Another and more interesting verification of the chumfo philosophy is open toany man who will go quietly through the big woods by moonlight, putting himselfback amid primal or animal conditions, and observing himself closely as he doesso. The man who has not traveled the wilderness alone at night has a vivid andilluminating experience awaiting him. He is amazed, so soon as he overcomes thefirst unnatural feeling of fear, to find how alive he is, and how much better hecan hear and smell than ever he dreamed. At such a time one's whole body seemsto become a delicately poised instrument for receiving sense impressions, andone's skin especially begins to tingle and creep as it wakes from its longsleep. Nor is this \"creeping\" of the skin strange or queer, as we assume, butperfectly natural. The sensations which we now ignorantly associate with fear ofthe dark (a late and purely human development; the animal knows it not) are inreality the sensations of awakening life.Possibly we may explain this supersensitiveness of the skin, when life awakensin it once more and it becomes for us another and finer instrument ofperception, by the simple biological fact that every cell of the multitudeswhich make up the human body has a more or less complete organization withinitself. Moreover, as late experiments have shown, a cell or a tissue of cellswill live and prosper in a suitable environment when completely separated fromthe body of which it was once a part. These human cells inherit certaincharacteristics common to all animal cells since life began; and it is notimprobable that they inherit also something of the primal cell's sensibility, orcapacity to receive impressions from the external world. This universalcell-function was largely given over when the animal (a collection of cells)began to develop special organs of touch, sight, and hearing; but there is noindication that the original power of sensibility has ever been wholly destroyedin any cell. It is, therefore, still within the range of biological possibilitythat a man should hear with his fingers or smell with his toes, since every cellof both finger and toe once did a work corresponding to the present functions ofthe five animal senses.Before you dismiss this as an idle or impossible theory, try a simpleexperiment, which may open your eyes to the reality of living things. Go to agreenhouse and select a spot of bare earth under a growing rose-bush. Examinethe surface carefully, then brush and examine it again, to be sure that not aroot of any kind is present. Now place a handful of good plant-food on theselected spot, and go away to your own affairs. Return in a week or so, brushaside your \"bait,\" and there before your eyes is a mass of white feeding-rootswhere no root was before. In some way, deep under the soil, the hungry cellshave heard or smelled or felt a rumor of food, and have headed for it as surelyas a dog follows his nose to his dinner.Do plants, then, know what they do when they turn to the light, and is theresomething like consciousness in a tree or a blade of grass? That is too much toassert, though one may think or believe so. No man can answer the question whichoccurs so constantly to one who lives among growing things; but you can hardlyleave your simple experiment without formulating a theory that even the hiddenrootlets of a rose-bush have something fundamentally akin to our highlydeveloped sensibility. At present some biologists are beginning to assert, andconfidently, though it is but an opinion, that there is no dead matter in theworld; that the ultimate particles of which matter is composed are all intenselyalive. And if alive, they must be sentient; that is, each must have aninfinitesimal degree of feeling or sense perception.image [images/9781591438984_006.jpg]To return from our speculation, and to illustrate the chumfo faculty from humanand animal experience: I was once sitting idly on a Nantucket wharf, alternatelywatching some hermit-crabs scurrying about in their erratic fashion under thetide, and an old dog that lay soaking himself in the warm sunshine. Just behindus, the only inharmonious creatures in the peaceful scene, some laborers wereunloading rocks from a barge by the aid of a derrick. For more than an hour, orever since I came to the wharf, the dog lay in the same spot, and in all thattime I did not see him move a muscle. He was apparently sound asleep. Suddenlyhe heaved up on his rheumatic legs, sniffed the air alertly, and turned his headthis way, that way, as if wary of something.The human labor had proceeded lazily, for the day was warm; there was no changein the environment, so far as I could discern; the only sounds in the air werethe sleepy lap of wavelets and the creaking of pulleys; yet my instant thoughtwas, \"That dog is frightened; but at what?\" After a few moments of watching hemoved off a dozen yards and threw himself flat on his side to sleep again. Hisbody was hardly relaxed when a guy-rope parted, and the iron-bound mast of thederrick crashed down on the wharf.It was certainly \"touch and go\" for me; I felt the wind of the thing as it fell,and was almost knocked off the wharf; but I was not thinking then of my ownclose call. With my interest at high pitch I examined the mast, and found itlying squarely athwart the impression left by the dog in the dust of the road.\"Merely a coincidence,\" you say; which indicates that we are apt to think alikeand in set formulas. That is precisely what I said at the time—a merecoincidence, but a startling one, which made me think of luck (a most foolishnotion) and wonder why luck should elect to light on a worthless old dog andtake no heed of what seemed to me then a precious young man. But I have sincechanged my mind; and here is one of the many observations which made me changeit.Years afterward my Indian guide, Simmo, was camped with a white man beside asalmon river. It was a rough night, and a storm was roaring over the big woods.For shelter they had built a bark commoosie, and for comfort a fire of birchlogs. At about nine o'clock they turned in, each wrapped in his blanket, andslept soundly but lightly, as woodsmen do, after a long day on the trail. Sometime later—hours, probably, for the fire was low, the storm hushed, the worldintensely still—the white man was awakened by a touch, and opened his eyes tofind his companion in a tense, listening attitude.\"Bes' get out of here quick, 'fore somet'ing come,\" said the Indian, and threwoff his blanket.\"But why—what—how do you know?\" queried the white man, startled but doubting,for he had listened and heard nothing.The Indian, angered as an Indian of the woods always is when you question orchallenge his craft, made an impatient gesture. \"Don' know how; don' know why;just know. Come!\" he called sharply, and the white man followed him away fromthe camp toward the river, where it was lighter. For several minutes they stoodthere, like two alert animals, searching the dark woods with all their senses;but nothing moved. The white man was beginning another fool question when therecame a sudden dull crack, a booming of air, as a huge yellow-birch stub toppledover the fire and flattened the commoosie like a bubble.\"Dere! Das de feller mus' be comin',\" said Simmo. \"By cosh, now, nex' time Injuntell you one t'ing, p'r'aps you believe-um!\" And, as if it were the most naturalthing in the world, he stepped over death-and-destruction, kicked aside somerubbish, and lay down to sleep where he was before.\"How do I explain it?\" I don't. I simply recognize a fact which I cannotexplain, and which I will not blink by calling it another coincidence. For thefact is, as I judge, that a few men and many animals exercise some extra facultywhich I do not or cannot exercise, or have access to some source of informationwhich is closed to me. When I question the gifted men or women who possess thisfaculty, or what's-its-name, I find that they are as much in the dark about itas I am. They know certain things without knowing how they learn; and the onlyword of explanation they offer is that they \"feel\" thus and so—perhaps as ahorse feels when he is holding the right direction through a blinding snowstorm,as he does hold it, steadily, surely, if you are wise enough not to bother himwith the reins or your opinions.Simmo is one of these rare men. At one moment he is a mere child, so guileless,so natural, so innocent of worldly wisdom, that he is forever surprising you.Once when his pipe was lost I saw him fill an imaginary bowl, scratch animaginary match, and puff away with a look of heavenly content on his weatheredface. So you treat him as an unspoiled creature, humoring him, till there isdifficulty or danger ahead, or a man's work to be done, when he steps quietly tothe front as if he belonged there. Or you may be talking with him by thecamp-fire, elaborating some wise theory, when he brushes aside your bookknowledge as of no consequence and suddenly becomes a philosopher, proclaiming anew or startling doctrine of life in the sublimely unhampered way of Emerson,who finished off objectors by saying, \"I do not argue; I know.\" But whereEmerson gives you a mystical word or a bare assertion which he cannot possiblyprove, Simmo has a disconcerting way of establishing a challenged doctrine by aconcrete and undeniable fact.One misty day when we were astray in the wilderness, he and I, we attempted totravel by getting our compass bearings from the topmost twigs of the evergreens,which slant mostly in one direction. After blundering around for a time withoutgetting any nearer camp or familiar landmarks, Simmo remarked: \"Dese twigs lielike devil. I guess I bes' find-um way myself.\" And he did find it, and hold iteven after darkness fell, by instinctive feeling. At least, I judge it to havebeen a matter of feeling rather than of sense or observation, for his onlyexplanation was, \"Oh, w'en I goin' right I feel good; but w'en I goin' wrong Ioneasy.\"This natural feeling or impression of things beyond the range of sight, thisextra sense, or chumfo unity of all the senses, is probably akin to anotherfeeling by which the animal or man becomes aware of distant persons, or ofdistant moods or emotions. The sleeping dog's alarm beneath the weakenedderrick, or the sleeping Indian's uneasiness near the doomed birch-stub, mightbe explained on purely physical grounds: some tremor of parting fibers, somewarning vibration too faint for eardrums but heavy enough to shake a moredelicately poised nerve center, reached the inner beast or the inner man androused him to impending danger. (There is a deal of babble in this explanation,I admit, and still a mystery at the end of it.) But when a man or a brutereceives knowledge not of matter, but of minds or spirits like his own; when amother knows, for example, the mental state of a son who is far away, and whenno material vibrations of any known medium can pass between them,—then allsixth-sense theories, which must rest on the impinging of waves upon nervecenters, no longer satisfy or explain. We are in the more shadowy region ofthought transference or impulse transference, and it is in this silent,unexplored region that, as I now believe, a large part of animal communicationgoes on continually.That belief will grow more clear, and perhaps more reasonable, if you followthis unblazed trail a little farther.image [images/9781591438984_007.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_032.jpg]IVTHE way of animal communication now grows dimmer and dimmer, or some readers mayeven think it \"curiouser and curiouser,\" as Alice of Wonderland said when shefound herself lengthening out like a telescope. But there is certainly a trailof some kind ahead, and since we are apt to lose it or to wander apart, let usagree, if we can, upon some familiar fact or experience which may serve as aguiding landmark. Our general course will be as follows: first, to define oursubject, or rather, to make its meaning clear by illustration; second, toexamine the reasonableness of telepathy from a natural or biological viewpoint;and finally, to go afield with eyes and minds open to see what the birds or thebeasts may teach us of this interesting matter.It seems to be fairly well established that a few men and women of uncommonlyfine nervous organization (which means an uncommonly natural or healthyorganization) have the power of influencing the mind of another person at adistance; and this rare power goes by the name of thought transference, ortelepathy. The so-called crossing of letters, when two widely separated personssit down at the same hour to write each other on the same subject, is the mostfamiliar but not the most convincing example of the thing. Yes, I know the powerand the example are both challenged, since there are scientists who denytelepathy root and branch, as well as scientists who believe in it implicitly;but I also know something more convincing than any second-hand denial or belief,having at different times met three persons who used the \"gift\" so freely, andfor the most part so surely, that to ignore it would be to abandon confidence inmy own sense and judgment. I am not trying, therefore, to investigate anopinion, but to understand a fact.To illustrate the matter by a personal experience: For many years after I firstleft home my mother would become \"uneasy in her mind,\" as she expressed it,whenever a slight accident or danger or sickness had befallen me. If the eventwere to me serious or threatening, there was no more doubt or uneasiness on mymother's part. She would know within the hour that I was in trouble of somekind, and would write or telegraph to ask what was the matter.It is commonly assumed that any such power must be a little weird or uncanny;that it contradicts the wholesome experience of humanity or makes fantasticaddition to its natural faculties; and I confess that the general queerness, thelack of balance, the Hottentotish credulity of folk who dabble in occult mattersgive some human, if not reasonable, grounds for the assumption. Nevertheless, Ijudge that telepathy is of itself wholly natural; that it is a survival, anage-old inheritance rather than a new invention or discovery; that it might beexercised not by a few astonishing individuals, but by any normal man or womanwho should from infancy cultivate certain mental powers which we now habituallyneglect. I am led to this conviction because I have found something that verymuch resembles telepathy in frequent use throughout the entire animal kingdom.It is, as I think and shall try to make clear, a natural gift or faculty of theanimal mind, which is largely subconscious, and it is from the animal mind thatwe inherit it; just as a few woodsmen inherit the animal sense of direction, andcultivate and trust it till they are sure of their way in any wilderness, whilethe large majority of men, dulled by artificial habit, go promptly astraywhenever they venture beyond beaten trails.That the animals inherit this power of silent communication over great distancesis occasionally manifest even among our half-natural domestic creatures. Forexample, that same old setter of mine, Don, who introduced us to our fascinatingsubject, was left behind most unwillingly during my terms at school; but healways seemed to know when I was on my way home. For months at a stretch hewould stay about the house, obeying my mother perfectly, though she never likeda dog; but on the day I was expected he would leave the premises, paying no heedto orders, and go to a commanding ledge beside the lane, where he could overlookthe highroad. Whatever the hour of my coming, whether noon or midnight, there Iwould find him waiting.Once when I was homeward bound unexpectedly, having sent no word of my coming,my mother missed Don and called him in vain. Some hours later, when he did notreturn at his dinner-time or answer her repeated call, she searched for him andfound him camped expectantly in the lane. \"Oho! wise dog,\" said she. \"Iunderstand now. Your master is coming home.\" And without a doubt that it wouldsoon be needed, she went and made my room ready.If the dog had been accustomed to spend his loafing-time in the lane, one mightthoughtlessly account for his action by the accident or hit-or-miss theory; buthe was never seen to wait there for any length of time except on the days when Iwas expected. And once (unhappily the last time Don ever came to meet hismaster) he was observed to take up his watch within a few minutes of the hourwhen my train left the distant town. Apparently he knew when I headed homeward,but there was nothing in his instinct or experience to tell him how long thejourney might be. So he would wait patiently, loyally, knowing I was coming, andmy mother would take his dinner out to him.In many other ways Don gave the impression, if not the evidence, that he was a\"mind-reader.\" He always knew when Saturday came, or a holiday, and possibly hemay have associated the holiday notion with my old clothes; but how he knew whatluck the day had in store for him, as he often seemed to know the instant Iunsnapped his chain in the early morning, was a matter that at first greatlypuzzled me. If I appeared in my old clothes and set him free with the resolutionthat my day must be spent in study or tinkering or farm work, he would bid megood morning and go off soberly to explore the premises, as dogs are wont to do.But when I met him silently with the notion that the day was my day off, to bewasted in shooting or fishing or roving the countryside, then in some way Doncaught the notion instantly; he would be tugging at his leash before I reachedhim, and no sooner was he free than he was all over the yard in mad capers ormaking lunatic attempts to drag me off on our common holiday before breakfast.That any dog of mine should obey my word, doing gladly whatever I told him, wasto be expected; or that in the field he should watch for a motion of my hand andfollow it instantly, whether to charge or hold or come in or cast left or right,was a simple matter of training; but that this particular dog should, unknown tome, enter into my very feeling, was certainly not the result of education, andprobably not of sight or sense, as we ordinarily understand the terms. When wewere together of an evening before the fire, so long as I was working orpleasantly reading he would lie curled up on his own mat, without everdisturbing me till it was time for him to be put to bed, when he would remind meof the fact by nudging my elbow. But if an hour came when I was in perplexity,or had heard bad news and was brooding over it, hardly would I be away inthought, forgetful of Don's existence on a trail I must follow alone, when hissilky head would slide under my hand, and I would find his brown eyes searchingmy face with something inexpressibly fine and loyal and wistful in theirquestioning deeps.Thus repeatedly, unexpectedly, Don seemed to enter into my moods by some subtle,mysterious perception for which I have no name, and no explanation save theobvious one—that a man's will or emotion may fill a room with waves or vibrationas real as those streaming from a fire or a lighted candle, and that normalanimals have some unused bodily faculty for receiving precisely such messages orvibrations. But we are not yet quite ready for that part of our trail; it willcome later, when we can follow it with more understanding.Should this record seem to you too personal (I am dealing only with first-handimpressions of animal life), here is the story of another dog—not a blue-bloodedor highly trained setter, but just an ordinary, doggy, neglected kind ofdog—submitted by a scientific friend of mine, who very cautiously offers noexplanation, but is content to observe and verify the facts:This second dog, Watch by name and nature, was accustomed to meet his mastermuch as Don met me in the lane; but he did it much more frequently, and timedthe meeting more accurately. He was nearer the natural animal, never having beentrained in any way, and perhaps for that reason he retained more of the naturalgift or faculty of receiving a message from a distance. His owner, a busycarpenter and builder, had an office in town, and was accustomed to return fromhis office or work at all hours, sometimes early in the afternoon, and againlong after dark. At whatever hour the man turned homeward, Watch seemed tofollow his movement as if by sight; he would grow uneasy, would bark to be letout if he happened to be in the house, and would trot off to meet his masterabout half-way. Though he was occasionally at fault, and sometimes returned tobrood over the matter when his master, having started for home, was turned asideby some errand, his mistakes were decidedly exceptional rather than typical. Hisstrange \"gift\" was a matter of common knowledge in the neighborhood, andoccasionally a doubtful man would stage an experiment: the master would agree tomark the hour when he turned homeward, and one or more interested persons wouldkeep tabs on the dog. So my scientific friend repeatedly tested Watch, andobserved him to take the road within a few moments of the time when his masterleft his office or building operations in the town, some three or four milesaway.Thus far the record is clear and straight, but there is one important matterwhich my friend overlooked, as scientific men commonly do when they deal withnature, their mistake being to regard animals as featureless members of a classor species rather than as individuals. The dog's master always came or went in awagon drawn by a quiet old horse, and upon inquiry I found that between Watchand the horse was a bond of comradeship, such as often exists between twodomestic animals of different species. Thus, the dog often preferred to sleep inthe stall near his big chum, or would accompany him to the pasture when he wasturned loose, and would always stand by, as if overlooking the operation, whenthe horse was being harnessed. It may well be, therefore, that it was from thehorse rather than from the man that Watch received notice when heads were turnedhomeward; but of the fact that some kind of telepathic communication passedbetween two members of the trio there is no reasonable doubt.Some of my readers may make objection at this point that, though something liketelepathic communication appears now and then among the brutes, it should beregarded as merely freakish or sensational, like a two-headed calf; while otherswill surely ask, \"Why, if our dogs possess such a convenient faculty, do theynot use it more frequently, more obviously, and so spare themselves manifolddiscomforts or misunderstandings?\"Such an objection is natural enough, since we judge as we live, mostly by habit;but it has no validity, I think, and for two reasons. First, because suchanimals as we have thus far seen exercising the faculty (and they are but a fewout of many) are apparently normal and sensible beasts, precisely like theirless-gifted fellows; and second, because the telepathic power itself, when oneexamines it without prejudice, appears to be wholly natural, and sane or simpleas the power of thought, even of such rudimentary thought as may be exercised inan animal's head. As for emotions, more intense and penetrating than anythought, it is hardly to be questioned that a man's fear or panic may flowthrough his knees into the horse he is riding, or that emotional excitement mayspread through a crowd of men without visible or audible expression. That a dogshould receive a wordless message or impulse from his master at a distance ofthree or four miles is, fundamentally, no more unnatural than that one manshould feel another's mood at a distance of three or four feet. Whether we canexplain the phenomenon on strictly biological or scientific grounds is anothermatter.I am not a biologist, unfortunately, and must go catfootedly when I enter thatstrange garret. I look with wonder on these patient, unemotional men who carenothing for a bear or an eagle, but who creep lower and ever lower in the scaleof living things, searching with penetrating looks among infinitesimal microbesfor the secret that shall solve the riddle of the universe by telling us whatlife is. And because man is everywhere the same, watching these exploringbiologists I remember the curious theology of certain South-Pacific savages, whosay that God made all things, the stars and the world and the living man; but wecannot see Him because He is so very small, because a dancing mote or a grain ofsand is for Him a roomy palace. Yet even with a modest little knowledge ofbiology we may find a viewpoint, I think, from which telepathy orthought-transference would appear as natural, as inevitable, as the forthgoingof light from a burning lamp.Thus, historically there was a time when the living cell, or the cell-of-life,as one biologist calls it with rare distinction, was sensitive only to pressure;when in its darkness it knew of an external world only by its own tremblings, inresponse to vibrations which poured over it from every side. Something made ittremble, and that \"something\" had motion or life like its own. Such,imaginatively, was the sentient cell's first knowledge, the result of a sense oftouch distributed throughout its protecting surface.Long afterward came a time when the living cell, multiplied now a millionfold,began to develop special sense-organs, each a modification of its rudimentarysense of touch; one to receive vibrations of air, for hearing; another to catchsome of the thronging ether waves, for seeing; a third to register the floatingparticles of matter on a sensitive membrane, for taste or smelling. By that timethe cell had learned beyond a peradventure that the universe outside itself hadlight and color and fragrance and harmony. Finally came a day when the cell,still multiplying and growing ever more complex, became conscious of a new powerwithin itself, most marvelous of all the powers of earth, the power to think, tofeel, and to be aware of a self that registered its own impressions of theexternal world. And then the cell knew, as surely as it knew sound or light,that the universe held consciousness also, and some infinite source of thoughtand feeling. Such, apparently, was the age-long process from the sentient cellto the living man.Since we are following a different trail, this is hardly the time or place toface the question how this development from mere living to conscious life tookplace, even if one were wise or rash enough to grapple with the final problem ofevolution. Yet it may not be amiss while we \"rest a pipe,\" as the voyageurs say,to point out that, of the two possible answers to our question (aside from theconvenient and restful answer that God made things so), only one, curiouslyenough, has thus far been considered by our physical scientists. The thousandbooks and theories of evolution which one reads are all reducible to thiselementary proposition: that the simple things of life became complex by innernecessity. In other words, an eye became an eye, or an oak an oak, or a man aman, simply because each must develop according to the inner law of its being.That may be true, though the all-compelling \"inner law\" is still only a vagueassumption, and the mystery of its origin is untouched; but why not by outercompulsion as reasonably as by inner necessity? A cell-of-life that wasconstantly bombarded by moving particles of matter might be compelled to developa sense of touch, in order to save its precious life by differentiating suchparticles into good and bad, or helpful and harmful. A cell over whichvibrations of air and ether were continually passing might be forced for its owngood to develop an ear and an eye to receive such vibrations as sound and light;and a cell over which mysterious waves of thought and emotion were ceaselesslyflowing might be driven to comprehend that particular mystery by developing athought and emotion of its own.I do not say that this is the right answer; I mention it merely as a speculativepossibility, in order to get our alleged scientific mind out of its deep rut ofhabit by showing that every road has two sides, though a man habitually use onlyone; and that Reason or Law or God, or whatever you choose to call the ultimatemainspring of life, is quite as apt to be found on one side of the road as onthe other. Inner necessity is not a whit more logical or more explanatory thanexternal force or compulsion when we face the simple fact that an animal nowsees and feels in the light instead of merely existing in darkness, or thatprimitive cells which were dimly sentient have now become as thinking gods,knowing good and evil.What this thought of ours is we do not know. Beyond the fact that we have it anduse it, thought still remains a profound mystery. That it is a living force ofsome kind; that it projects itself or its waves outward, as the sun cannot butsend forth his light; that it affects men as surely as gravitation or heat orthe blow of a hammer affects them,—all this is reasonably clear and certain. Buthow thought travels; what refined mental ether conveys it outward with a speedthat makes light as slow as a glacier by comparison, and with a force that sendsit through walls of stone and into every darkness that the light cannotpenetrate,—this and the origin of thought are questions so deep that our sciencehas barely formulated them, much less dreamed of an answer. Yet if we once grantthe simple proposition that thought is a force, that it moves inevitably fromits source to its object, the conclusion is inevitable that any thinking mindshould be able to send its silent message to any other mind in the universe.There is nothing in the nature of either mind or matter to preclude such apossibility; only our present habit of speech, of too much speech, prevents usfrom viewing it frankly.As a purely speculative consummation, therefore, the time may come whentelepathy shall appear as the natural or perfect communication among enlightenedminds, and language as a temporary or evolutionary makeshift. But that beckonsus away to an imaginative flight among the clouds, and on the earth at our feetis the trail we must follow.The question why our dogs, if they have the faculty of receiving a master'smessage at a distance, do not use it more obviously, is one that I cannotanswer. Perhaps the reason is obvious enough to some of the dogs, which have asidelong way of coming home from their roving, as if aware they had long beenwanted. Or, possibly, the difficulty lies not in the dog, but in his master.Every communication has two ends, one sending, the other receiving; and of athousand owners there are hardly two who know how properly to handle a dogeither by speech or by silence. Still again, one assumption implied in thequestion is that dogs or any other animals of the same kind are all alike; andthat common assumption is very wide of the fact. Animals differ as widely intheir instinctive faculties as men in their judgments; which partly explains whyone setter readily follows his master's word or hand, or enters into his mood,while another remains hopelessly dumb or unresponsive. The telepathic facultyappears more frequently, as we shall see, among birds or animals that habituallylive in flocks or herds, and I have always witnessed its most striking orimpressive manifestation between a mother animal and her young, as if someprenatal influence or control were still at work.For example, I have occasionally had the good luck to observe a she-wolf leadingher pack across the white expanse of a frozen lake in winter; and at such timesthe cubs have a doggish impulse to run after any moving object that attractstheir attention. If a youngster breaks away to rush an animal that he seesmoving in the woods (once that moving animal was myself), the mother heads himinstantly if he is close to her; but if he is off before she can check him by amotion of her ears or a low growl, she never wastes time or strength in chasinghim. She simply holds quiet, lifts her head high, and looks steadily at therunning cub. Suddenly he wavers, halts, and then, as if the look recalled him,whirls and speeds back to the pack. If the moving object be proper game afoot,the mother now goes ahead to stalk or drive it, while the pack followsstealthily behind her on either side; but if the distant object be a moose or aman, or anything else that a wolf must not meddle with, then the mother wolftrots quietly on her way without a sound, and the errant cub falls into place asif he had understood her silent command.You may observe the same phenomenon of silent order and ready obedience nearerhome, if you have patience to watch day after day at a burrow of young foxes. Ihave spent hours by different dens, and have repeatedly witnessed what seemed tobe excellent discipline; but I have never yet heard a vixen utter a growl or cryor warning of any kind. That audible communication comes later, when the cubsbegin to hunt for themselves; and then you will often hear the mother'squerulous squall or the cubs' impatient crying when they are separated in thedark woods. While the den is their home (they seldom enter it after they onceroam abroad) silence is the rule, and that silence is most eloquent. For hoursat a stretch the cubs romp lustily in the afternoon sunshine, some stalkingimaginary mice or grasshoppers, others challenging their mates to mock fights ormock hunting; and the most striking feature of the exercise, after you havebecome familiar with the fascinating little creatures, is that the old vixen,who lies apart where she can overlook the play and the neighborhood, seems tohave the family under perfect control at every instant, though never a word isuttered.That some kind of communication passes among these intelligent little brutes isconstantly evident; but it is without voice or language. Now and then, when acub's capers lead him too far from the den, the vixen lifts her head to look athim intently; and somehow that look has the same effect as the she-wolf's silentcall; it stops the cub as if she had sent a cry or a messenger after him. Ifthat happened once, you might overlook it as a matter of mere chance; but ithappens again and again, and always in the same challenging way. The eager cubsuddenly checks himself, turns as if he had heard a command, catches the vixen'slook, and back he comes like a trained dog to the whistle.As the shadows lengthen on the hillside, and the evening comes when the mothermust go mousing in the distant meadow, she rises quietly to her feet. Instantlythe play stops; the cubs gather close, their heads all upturned to the greaterhead that bends to them, and there they stand in mute intentness, as if themother were speaking and the cubs listening. For a brief interval that tensescene endures, exquisitely impressive, while you strain your senses to catch itsmeaning. There is no sound, no warning of any kind that ears can hear. Then thecubs scamper quickly into the burrow; the mother, without once looking back,slips away into the shadowy twilight. At the den's mouth a foxy little faceappears, its nostrils twitching, its eyes following a moving shadow in thedistance. When the shadow is swallowed up in the dusk the face draws back, andthe wild hillside is wholly silent and deserted.You can go home now. The vixen may be hours on her hunting, but not a cub willagain show his nose until she returns and calls him. If a human mother couldexercise such silent, perfect discipline, or leave the house with the certaintythat four or five lively youngsters would keep out of danger or mischief ascompletely as young fox cubs keep out of it, raising children might moreresemble \"one grand sweet song\" than it does at present.image [images/9781591438984_006.jpg]So far as I have observed grown birds or beasts, the faculty of silentcommunication occurs most commonly among those that are gregarious or stronglysocial in their habits. The timber-wolves of the North are the first examplesthat occur to me, and also the most puzzling. They are wary brutes, so much sothat those who have spent a lifetime near them will tell you that it is uselessto hunt a wolf by any ordinary method; that your meeting with him is a matter ofchance or rare accident; that not only has he marvelously keen ears, eyes thatsee in the dark, and a nose that cannot be deceived, but he can also \"feel\" adanger which is hidden from sight or smell or hearing. Such is the Indianverdict; and I have followed wolves often and vainly enough to have somesympathy with it.The cunning of these animals would be uncanny if it were merely cunning; but itis naturally explained, I think, on the assumption that wolves, more than mostother brutes, receive silent warnings from one another, or even from a concealedhunter, who may by his excitement send forth some kind of emotional alarm. Whenyou are sitting quietly in the woods, and a pack of wolves pass near withoutnoticing their one enemy, though he is in plain sight, you think that they areno more cunning than a bear or a buck; and that is true, so far as their cunningdepends on what they may see or hear. Once when I was crossing a frozen lake ina snow-storm a whole pack of wolves rushed out of the nearest cover and came atme on the jump, mistaking me for a deer or some other game animal; which doesnot speak very highly for either their eyes or their judgment. They were themost surprised brutes in all Canada when they discovered their mistake. But whenyou hide with ready rifle near some venison which the same wolves have killed;when you see them break out of the woods upon the ice, running free andconfident to the food which they know is awaiting them; when you see them stopsuddenly, as if struck, though they cannot possibly see or smell you, and thenscatter and run by separate trails to a meeting-point on another lake—well, thenyou may conclude, as I do, that part of a wolf's cunning lies deeper than hisfive senses.Another lupine trait which first surprised and then challenged my woodcraft isthis: in the winter-time, when timber-wolves commonly run in small packs, asolitary or separated wolf always seems to know where his mates are hunting oridly roving or resting in their day-bed. The pack is made up of his familyrelatives, younger or older, all mothered by the same she-wolf; and by some bondor attraction or silent communication he can go straight to them at any hour ofthe day or night, though he may not have seen them for a week, and they havewandered over countless miles of wilderness in the interim.We may explain this fact, if such it be (I shall make it clear presently), onthe simple ground that the wolves, though incurable rovers, have bounds beyondwhich they seldom pass; that they return on their course with more or lessregularity; and that in traveling, as distinct from hunting, they always followdefinite runways, like the foxes. Because of these fixed habits, a solitary wolfmight remember that the pack was due in a certain region on a certain day, andby going to that region and putting his nose to the runways he could quicklypick up the fresh trail of his fellows. There is nothing occult in such aprocess; it is a plain matter of brain and nose.Such an explanation sounds reasonable enough; too reasonable, in fact, since abrute probably acts more intuitively and less rationally; but it does notaccount for the amazing certainty of a wounded wolf when separated from hispack. He always does separate, by the way; not because the others would eat him,for that is not wolf nature, but because every stricken bird or beast seeksinstinctively to be alone and quiet while his hurt is healing. I have followedwith keen interest the doings of one wounded wolf that hid for at least two daysand nights in a sheltered den, after which he rose from his bed and wentstraight as a bee's flight to where his pack had killed a buck and left plentyof venison behind them.In this case it is possible to limit the time of the wounded wolf's seclusion,because the limping track that led from the den was but a few hours old when Ifound it, and the only track leading into the den was half obliterated by snowwhich had fallen two nights previously. How many devious miles the pack hadtraveled in the interim would be hard to estimate. I crossed their hunting orroaming trails at widely separate points, and once I surprised them in theirday-bed; but I never found the limit of their great range. A few days later thatsame limping wolf left another den of his, under a windfall, and headed not forthe buck, which was now frozen stiff, but for another deer which the same packhad killed in a different region, some eight or ten straight miles away, andperhaps twice that distance as wolves commonly travel.If you contend that this wounded wolf must have known where the meat was by thehowling of the pack when they killed, I grant that may be true in one case, butcertainly not in the other. For by great good luck I was near the pack,following a fresh trail in the gray, breathless dawn, when the wolves killed thesecond deer; and there was not a sound for mortal ears to hear, not a howl or atrail cry or even a growl of any kind. They followed, killed and ate in silence,as wolves commonly do, their howling being a thing apart from their hunting. Thewounded wolf was then far away, with miles of densely wooded hills and valleysbetween him and his pack.Do you ask, \"How was it possible to know all this?\" From the story the snowtold. At daybreak I had found the trail of a hunting pack, and was following itstealthily, with many a cautious detour and look ahead, for they areunbelievably shy brutes; and so it happened that I came upon the carcass of thedeer only a few minutes after the wolves had fed and roamed lazily off towardtheir day-bed. I followed them too eagerly, and alarmed them before I could pickthe big one I wanted; whereupon they took to rough country, traveling a pacethat left me hopelessly far behind. When I returned to the deer, to read how thewolves had surprised and killed their game, I noticed the fresh trail of asolitary wolf coming in at right angles to the trail of the hunting pack. It wasthe limper again, who had just eaten what he wanted and trailed off by himself.I followed and soon jumped him, and took after him on the lope, thinking I couldrun him down or at least come near enough for a revolver-shot; but that was afoolish notion. Even on three legs he whisked through the thick timber so mucheasier than I could run on snowshoes that I never got a second glimpse of him.By that time I was bound to know, if possible, how the limper happened to findthis second deer for his comfort; so I picked up his incoming trail and ran itclear back to his den under the windfall, from which he had come as straight asif he knew exactly where he was heading. His trail was from eastward; whatlittle air was stirring came from the south; so that it was impossible for hisnose to guide him to the meat even had he been within smelling distance, as hecertainly was not. The record in the snow was as plain as any other print, andfrom it one might reasonably conclude that either the wolves can send forth asilent food-call, with some added information, or else that a solitary wolf maybe so in touch with his pack-mates that he knows not only where they are, butalso, in a general way, what they are doing.In comparison with timber-wolves the caribou is rather a witless brute; but he,too, has his \"uncanny\" moods, and one who patiently follows him, with deeperinterest in his anima than in his antlered head, finds him frequently doing someodd or puzzling thing which may indicate a perception more subtle than that ofhis dull eyes or keen ears or almost perfect nose. Here is one example ofMegaleep's peculiar way:I was trailing a herd of caribou one winter day on the barrens (treeless plainsor bogs) of the Renous River in New Brunswick. For hours I had followed throughalternate thick timber and open bog without alarming or even seeing my game. Theanimals were plainly on the move, perhaps changing their feeding-ground; andwhen Megaleep begins to wander no man can say where he will go, or where stop,or what he is likely to do next. Once, after trailing him eight or ten miles,twice jumping him, I met him head-on, coming briskly back in his own tracks, asif to see what was following him. From the trail I read that there were a dozenanimals in the herd, and that one poor wounded brute lagged continually behindthe others. He was going on three legs; his right forefoot, the bone above itshattered by some blundering hunter's bullet, swung helplessly as he hobbledalong, leaving its pathetic record in the snow.On a wooded slope which fell away to a chain of barrens, halting to search thetrail ahead, my eye caught a motion far across the open, and through thefield-glass I saw my herd for the first time, resting unsuspiciously on thefarther edge of the barren, a full mile or more away. From my feet the trail leddown through a dense fringe of evergreen, and then straight out across the levelplain. A few of the caribou were lying down; others moved lazily in or out ofthe forest that shut in the barren on that side; and as I watched them twoanimals' yearlings undoubtedly, put their heads together for a pushing match,like domestic calves at play.Hardly had I begun to circle the barren, keeping near the edge of it but alwaysout of sight in the evergreens, when I ran upon a solitary caribou trail, thetrail of the cripple, who had evidently wearied and turned aside to rest,perhaps knowing that his herd was near the end of its journey. A little fartheron I jumped him out of a fir thicket, and watched him a moment as he hobbleddeeper into the woods, heading away to the west. The course surprised me alittle, for his mates were northward; and at the thought I quickly found anopening in the cover and turned my glass upon the other caribou. Already theywere in wild alarm. For a brief interval they ran about confusedly, or stoodtense as they searched the plain and the surrounding woods for the source ofdanger; then they pushed their noses out and racked away at a marvelous pace,crossing the barren diagonally toward me and smashing into the woods a shortdistance ahead, following a course which must soon bring them and their woundedmate together. If I were dealing with people, I might say confidently that theywere bent on finding out what the alarm was about; but as I have no means ofknowing the caribou motive, I can only say that the two trails ran straight as astring through the timber to a meeting-point on the edge of another barren tothe westward.If you would reasonably explain the matter, remember that these startled animalswere far away from me; that the cripple and myself were both hidden from theireyes, and that I was moving upwind and silently. It was impossible that theyshould hear or see or smell me; yet they were on their toes a moment after thecripple started up, as if he had rung a bell for them. It was not the first timeI had witnessed a herd of animals break away when, as I suspected, they hadreceived some silent, incomprehensible warning, nor was it the last; but it wasthe only time when I could trace the whole process without break or questionfrom beginning to end. And when, to test the matter to the bottom, I ran thetrail of the herd back to where they had been resting, there was no track of manor beast in the surrounding woods to account for their flight.One may explain this as a mere coincidence, which is not an explanation; or callit another example of the fact that wild animals are \"queer,\" which is not afact; but in my own mind every action of the caribou and all the circumstancespoint to a different conclusion—namely, that the fear or warning or impulse ofone animal was instantly transferred to others at a distance. I think, also,that the process was not wholly unconscious or subconscious' but that one animalsent forth his warning and the others acted upon it more or less intelligently.This last is a mere assumption, however, which cannot be proved till we learn tolive in an animal's skin.It is true that the event often befalls otherwise, since you may jump one animalwithout alarming others of the same herd; and it is possible that the degree orquality of the alarm has something to do with its carrying power, as we feel theintense emotion of a friend more quickly than his ordinary moods. In this casethe solitary caribou was tremendously startled; for I was very near, and thefirst intimation he had of me, or I of him, was when my snow-shoe caught on asnag and I pitched over a log almost on top of him. Yet the difficulty ofdrawing a conclusion from any single instance appears in this: that I have morethan once stalked, killed and dressed an animal without disturbing others of hiskind near at hand (it may be that no alarm was sent out, for the animal was shotbefore he knew the danger, and in the deep woods animals pay little attention tothe sound of a rifle); and again, when I have been trying to approach a herdfrom leeward, I have seen them move away hurriedly, silently, suspiciously, inobedience to some warning which seemed to spread through the woods like acontagion.The latter experience is common enough among hunters of big game, who are oftenat a loss to explain the sudden flight of animals that a moment ago, underprecisely the same outward influences, were feeding or resting withoutsuspicion. Thus, you may be stalking a big herd of elk, or wapiti, which arespread out loosely over half a mountainside. You are keen for the master bullwith the noble antlers; nothing else interests you, more's the pity; but yousoon learn that the cunning old brute is hidden somewhere in the midst of theherd, depending on the screen of cow-elk to warn him of danger to his preciousskin. Waiting impatiently till this vanguard has moved aside, you attempt toworm your way nearer to the hidden bull. You are succeeding beautifully, youthink, when a single cow that you overlooked begins to act uneasily. She has notseen or heard you, certainly, and the wind is still in your favor; but there shestands, like an image of suspicion, head up, looking, listening, testing theair, till she makes up her mind she would as lief be somewhere else, whenwithout cry or grunt or warning of any kind that ears can hear she turns andglides rapidly away.Now if you value animal lore above stuffed skins, or experience above the babbleof hunting naturalists, forget the big bull and his greed-stirring antlers;scramble quickly to the highest outlook at hand, and use your eyes. No alarm hasbeen sounded; the vast silence is unbroken; yet for some mysterious reason thewhole herd is suddenly on the move. To your right, to your left, near at hand orfar away, bushes quiver or jump; alert brown forms appear or vanish likeshadows, all silent and all heading in the direction taken by the firstsentinel. One moment there are scores of elk in sight, feeding or restingquietly; the next they are gone and the great hillside is lifeless. The thrillof that silent, moving drama has more wisdom in it, yes, and more pleasure, thanthe crash of your barbarous rifle or the convulsive kicking of a stricken beastthat knows not why you should kill him.Such is the experience, known to almost every elk-hunter who has learned thatlife is more interesting than death; and I know nothing of deer nature toexplain it save this—that the whole herd has suddenly felt and understood thesilent impulse to go, and has obeyed it without a question, as the young wolf orfox cub obeys the silent return call of his watchful mother.Such impulses seem to be more common and more dependable among the whales, whichhave rudimentary or imperfect sense-organs, but which are neverthelessdelicately sensitive to external impressions, to the approach of unseen danger,to the movements of the tiny creatures on which they feed, to changes of wind ortide and to a falling barometer, as if nature had given them a first-classfeeling apparatus of some kind to make up for their poor eyes and ears.Repeatedly have I been struck by this extraordinary sensitiveness when watchingthe monstrous creatures feeding with the tide in one of the great bays of theNewfoundland or the Labrador coast. If I lowered a boat to approach one of them,he would disapear silently before I could ever get near enough to see clearlywhat he was doing. That seemed odd to me; but presently I began to notice a morepuzzling thing: at the instant my whale took alarm every other whale of the samespecies seemed to be moved by the same impulse, sounding when the first sounded,or else turning with him to head for the open sea.A score of times I tried the experiment, and commonly, but not invariably, withthe same result. I would sight a few leviathans playing or feeding, shooting upfrom the deep, breaching half their length out of water to fall back with atremendous souse; and through my glasses I would pick up others here or there inthe same bay. Selecting a certain whale, I would glide rapidly toward him,crouching low in the dory and sculling silently by means of an oar over thestern. By some odd channel of perception (not by sight, certainly, for I keptout of the narrow range of his eye, and a whale is not supposed to smell orhear) he would invariably get wind of me and go down; and then, jumping to myfeet, I would see other whales in the distance catch the instant alarm, someupending as they plunged to the deeps, others whirling seaward and forging fullspeed ahead.This observation of mine is not unique, as I supposed, for later I heard itechoed as a matter of course by the whalemen. Thus, when I talked with myfriend, Captain Rule, about the ways of the great creatures he had followed inthe old whaling-days, he said, \"The queerest habit of a whale, or of any othercritter I ever fell foul of, was this: when I got my boat close enough to asperm-whale to put an iron into him, every other sperm-whale within ten mileswould turn flukes, as if he had been harpooned, too.\" But he added that he hadnot noticed the same contagion of alarm, not in the same striking orinstantaneous way, when hunting the right or Greenland whale—perhaps because thelatter is, as a rule, more solitary in its habits.Wolves and caribou and whales are far from the observation of most folk; but thewinter birds in your own yard may some time give you a hint, at least, of thesame mysterious transference of an impulse over wide distances. When you scatterfood for them during a cold snap or after a storm (it is better not to feed themregularly, I think, especially in mild weather when their proper food is notcovered with snow) your bounty is at first neglected except by the housesparrows and starlings. Unlike our native birds, these imported foreigners areeasily \"pauperized,\" seeking no food for themselves so long as you take care ofthem. They keep tabs on you, also, waiting patiently about the house, and soonlearn what it means when you emerge from your back door on a snowy morning witha broom in one hand and a pan in the other. They are feeding greedily the momentyour back is turned, and for a time they are the only birds at the table. Whenthey have gorged themselves, for they have no manners, a few tree-sparrows andjuncos flit in to eat daintily. Then suddenly the wilder birds appear—jays,chickadees, siskins, kinglets and, oh, welcome! a flock of bob-whites—comingfrom you know not where, in obedience to a summons which you have not heard.Some of these may have visited the yard in time past, and are returning to itnow, hunger driven; but others you have never before met within the city limits,and a few have their accustomed dwelling in the pine woods, which are milesaway. How did these hungry hermits suddenly learn that food was here?The answer to that question is simple, and entirely \"sensible\" if you think onlyof birds that live or habitually glean in your neighborhood. Some of them sawyou scatter the food, or else found it by searching, while others spied theselucky ones feeding and came quickly to join the feast. For birds that live widerafield there is also an explanation that your senses can approve, though it isprobably wrong or only half right: from a distance they chanced to see wingsspeeding in the direction of your yard, and followed them expectantly becausewings may be as eloquent as voices, the flight of a bird when he is heading forfood being very different from the flight of the same bird when he is merelylooking for food. But these most rare visitors, kinglets or pine-finches orgrosbeaks or bob-whites, that never before entered your yard, and that would notbe here now had you not thought to scatter food this morning,—at these you shakeyour head, calling it chance or Providence or mystery, according to your mood ordisposition. To me, after observing the matter closely many times, thereasonable explanation of these rare visitors is that either wild birds know howto send forth a silent food-call or, more likely, that the excitement of feedingbirds spreads powerfully outward, and is felt by other starving birds, alert andsensitive, at a distance beyond all possible range of sight or hearing. By noother hypothesis can I account for the fact that certain wild birds make theirappearance in my yard at a moment when a number of other birds are eagerlyfeeding, and at no other time, though I watch for them from one year's end toanother.Like every other explanation, whether of stars or starlings, this also leads toa greater mystery. The distance at which such a summoning call can be felt byothers must be straitly limited, else would all the starving birds of a state beflocking to my yard on certain mornings; and the force by which the silent callis projected is as unknown as the rare mental ether which bears its waves orvibrations in all directions. Yet the problem need not greatly trouble us, sincethe answer, when it comes, will be as natural as breathing. If silent ortelepathic communication exists in nature, and I think it surely does, themystery before us is no greater than that which daily confronts the astronomeror the wireless operator. One measures the speed of light from Orion; the otherprojects his finger-touch across an ocean; but neither can tell or even guessthe quality of the medium by which the light or the electric wave is carried toits destination.image [images/9781591438984_008.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_033.jpg]VTHIS is a chapter on the wing drill of birds, the swarming of bees, the panicsand unseasonal migrations of larger or smaller beasts, and other curiousphenomena in which the wild creatures of a flock or herd all act in unison,doing the same thing at the same time, as if governed by a single will ratherthan by individual motives. If it should turn out that the single will wereexpressed in a voice or cry, or even in a projected impulse, then are we againface to face with our problem of animal communication.Of the fact of collective action there is no doubt, many naturalists havingwitnessed it; and there is also a strictly orthodox explanation. Thus, when yousee a large flock of crows \"drilling\" in the spring or autumn, rising or fallingor wheeling all together with marvelous precision, the ornithologists resolvethe matter by saying that the many crows act as one crow because they follow a\"collective impulse\"; that is, because the same impulse to rise or fall or wheelseizes upon them all at precisely the same moment. And this they tell you quitesimply, as if pointing out an obvious fact of natural history, when in realitythey are showing you the rarest chimera that ever looked out of a vacuum.Now the wonderful wing drill of certain birds has something in it which I cannotquite fathom or understand, not even with a miracle of collective impulse tohelp me; yet I have observed two characteristics of the ordered flight which mayhelp to dispel the fog of assumption that now envelops it. The first is, thatthe drill is seen only when an uncommonly large number of birds of the same kindare gathered together, on a sunny day of early spring, as a rule, or in theperfection of autumn weather.The starlings*5 [9781591438984_ftn.htm#ftn5] furnish us an excellent example ofthis peculiarity. For months at a stretch you see them about the house, first inpairs, next in family groups, then in larger companies, made up, I think, ofbirds raised in the same neighborhood and probably all more or less related; butthough you watch these companies attentively from dawn to dusk, you shall neversee them going through any unusual wing drill. Then comes an hour when flocks ofstarlings appear on all sides, heading to a common center. They gather in treeshere or there about the edges of a great field or a strip of open beach, alljabbering like the blackbirds, which they imitate in their cries, flitting aboutin ceaseless commotion, but apparently keeping their family or tribalorganization intact. Suddenly, as at a signal, they all launch themselves towardthe center of the field; the hundred companies unite in one immense flock, andpresto! the drill is on. The birds are no longer individuals, but asingle-minded myriad, which wheels or veers with such precision that the flashof their ten-thousand wings when they turn is like the flicker of a signal glassin the sun.The same characteristic of uncommon numbers holds true of the crows and, indeed,of all other species of birds, save one, that ever practise the wing drill. Wildgeese when in small companies, each a family unit, have a regular and beautifulflight in harrow-shaped formation; but I have never witnessed anything like awing drill among them save on one occasion, when a thousand or more of the birdswere gathered together for a few days of frolic before beginning the southernmigration. Nor have I ever seen the drill among thrushes or warblers or sparrowsor terns or seagulls, which sometimes gather in uncounted numbers, but which donot, apparently, have the same motive that leads crows or starlings to unite ina kind of rhythmic air-dance on periodic occasions.A second marked characteristic of the wing drill is that it is invariably amanifestation of play or sport, and that the individual birds, though they keepthe order of the play marvelously well, show in their looks and voices asuppressed emotional excitement. The drill is never seen when birds aremigrating or feeding or fleeing from danger, though thousands of them may betogether at such a time, but only when they assemble in a spirit of fun orexercise, and their bodily needs are satisfied, and the weather or the barometeris just right, and no enemy is near to trouble them. Whatever their motive orimpulse, therefore, it is certainly not universal or even widespread among thebirds, since most of them do not practise the drill; nor is it in the least likethat mysterious impulse which suddenly sets all the squirrels of a region inmigration, or calls the lemmings to hurry over plain and forest and mountaintill they all drown themselves in the distant sea; for no sooner is the briefdrill over than the companies scatter quietly, each to its own place, and theindividual birds are again alert, inquisitive, well balanced, precisely as theywere before.The drill is seen at its best among the plover, I think; and, curiously enough,these are the only birds I know that practise it frequently, in small or largenumbers and in all weathers. I have often watched a flock come sweeping in to mydecoys, gurgling like a thousand fifes with bubbles in them; and never have Imet these perfectly drilled birds, which stay with us but a few hours on theirrapid journey from the far north to the far south, without renewed wonder attheir wildness, their tameness, their incomprehensible ways. That you mayvisualize our problem before I venture an explanation, here is what you may seeif you can forget your gun to observe nature with a deeper interest:You have risen soon after midnight, called by the storm and the shrilling ofpassing plover, and long before daylight you are waiting for the birds on theburnt-over plain. Your \"stand\" is a hole in the earth, hidden by a fewberry-bushes; and before you, at right angles with the course of the storm (forplover always wheel to head into the wind when they take the ground), are somescores of rudely painted decoys. As the day breaks you see against the east amotion as of wings, and your call rings out wild and clear, to be echoed on theinstant. In response to your whistle the distant motion grows wildly fantastic;it begins to whirl and eddy, as if a wisp of fog were rolling swiftly downwind;only in some mysterious fashion the fog holds together, and in it are curiousflickerings. Those are plover, certainly; no other birds have that perfect unityof movement; and now, since they are looking for the source of the call theyhave just heard, you throw your cap in the air or wave a handkerchief to attractattention. There is an answering flash of white from the under side of theirwings as the plover catch your signal and turn all at once to meet it. Here theycome, driving in at terrific speed straight at you!It is better to stop calling now, because the plover will soon see your decoys;and these birds when on the ground make no sound except a low, pulsating whistleof welcome or recall. This is uttered but seldom, and unless you can imitate it,which is not likely, your whistling will do no good. Besides, it could notpossibly be heard. Listen to that musical babel, and let your nerves dance toit! In all nature there is nothing to compare for utter wildness with thefluting of incoming plover.On they come, hundreds of quivering lines, which are the thin edges of wings,moving as one to a definite goal. Their keen eyes caught the first wave of yourhandkerchief in the distance; and now they see their own kind on the ground, asthey think, and their babel changes as they begin to talk to them. Suddenly, andso instantaneously that it makes you blink, there is a change of some kind inevery quivering pair of wings. At first, in the soft light of dawn, you are surethat the plover are still coming, for you did not see them turn; but the linesgrow smaller, dimmer, and you know that every bird in the flock has whirled, asif at command, and is now heading straight away. You put your fingers to yourlips and send out the eery plover call again and again; but it goes unheeded inthat tumult of better whistling. The quivering lines are now all blurred in one;with a final flicker they disappear below a rise of ground; the birds are gone,and you cease your vain calling. Then, when you are thinking you will never seethat flock again, a cloud of wings shoot up from the plain against the horizon;they fall, wheel, rise again in marvelous flight, not as a thousand individualsbut as a unit, and the lines grow larger, clearer, as the plover come sweepingback to your decoys once more.Such is the phenomenon as I witnessed it repeatedly on the Nantucket moors, manyyears ago. The only way I can explain the instantaneous change of flight is bythe assumption, no longer strange or untested, that from some alarmed plover onthe fringe or at the center of the flock a warning impulse is sent out, and thebirds all feel and obey it as one bird. That the warning is a silent one I amconvinced, for it seems impossible that any peculiar whistle could be heard orunderstood in that wild clamor of whistling. Nor is it a satisfactory hypothesisthat one bird sees the danger or suspects the quality of the decoys, and all theothers copy his swift flight; for in that case there must be succession or delayor straggling in the turning, and the impression left on the eye is not ofsuccession, but of almost perfect unity of movement.The only other explanation of the plovers' action is the one commonly found inthe bird-books, to which I have already briefly referred, and which we must nowexamine more narrowly. It assumes that all the birds of a migrating flock aremoved not by individual wills, but by a collective impulse or instinct, whichaffects them all alike at the same instant. In support of this favorite theorywe are told to consider the bees, which are said to have no individual motives,and no need for them, since they blindly follow a swarm or hive instinct thatmakes them all precisely alike in their actions. The same swarm instinct appearsoften in the birds, but less strongly, because they are more highly developedcreatures, with more need and therefore more capacity for individual incentive.This illustration of the hive is offered so confidently and accepted so readily,as if it were an axiom of natural history, that one hesitates to disturb theancient idol in its wonted seat. Yet one might argue that any living impulse,whether in bees or birds, must proceed from a living source, and, if that begranted, speculate on the absorbing business of a nature or a heaven that shouldbe perpetually interfering in behalf of every earthly flock or swarm or herd bysending the appropriate impulse at precisely the right moment. And when ourspeculation is at an end, I submit the fact that, when I have broken open ahoney-tree in the woods, one bee falls upon the sweets to gorge himself withal,while another from the same swarm falls angrily upon me and dies fighting; whichseems to upset the collective-impulse idol completely.I must confess here that I know very little about bees. They are still a mysteryto me, and I would rather keep silence about them until I find one bee that Ifancy I understand, or one man who offers something better than a very hazy ormystical explanation of a bee's extraordinary action. Yet I have watched longhours at a hive, have handled a swarm without gloves or mask, and have performeda few experiments—enough to convince me that the collective-impulse theory doesnot always hold true to fact even among our honey-makers. Indeed, I doubt thatit ever holds true, or that there is in nature any such mysterious thing as aswarm or flock or herd impulse.In the first place, the bees of the same swarm do not look alike or act alikeexcept superficially; at least I have not so observed them. Study the heads orthe feet of any two bees under a glass, and you shall find as much variety as inthe heads or feet of any other two creatures of the same kind, whether brute orhuman. The lines of difference run smaller, to be sure; but they are alwaysthere. In action also the bees are variable; they do marvelously wise things atone moment, or marvelously stupid things at another; but they do not all andalways do the same thing under the same circumstances, for when I haveexperimented with selected bees from the same hive I have noticed very differentresults; which leads me to suspect that even here I am dealing with individualsrather than with detached fragments of a swarm. It is hard, for example, to makea trap so simple that an imprisoned bee will find his way out of it; but when bygreat ingenuity you do at last make a trap so very simple that it seems anycreature with legs must walk out by the open door, perhaps one bee in five willdo the trick; while the other four wait patiently until they die for moresimplicity.Again, while your eye often sees unity of action among the wild creatures,neither your reading nor your own reason will ever reveal a scrap of positiveevidence that there is in nature any such convenient thing (humanly convenient,that is, for explanations) as a swarm or flock instinct; though, like themythical struggle for existence, we are forever hearing about it or buildingtheories upon it. So far as we know anything about instinct, it is neithercollective nor incorporeal. It is, to use the definition of Mark Hopkins, whichis as good as another and beautifully memorable, \"a propensity prior toexperience and independent of instruction.\" And the only needful addition tothis high-sounding definition is, that it is a \"propensity\" lodged in anindividual, every time. It is not and cannot be lodged in a swarm or a hive; youmust either put It into each of two bees or else put it between them, leavingthem both untouched. In other words, the swarm instinct has logically noabiding-place and no reality; it is a castle in the air with no solid foundationto rest on.On its practical or pragmatic side also the theory is a failure, since thethings bees are said to do in obedience to an incorporeal swarm instinct aremore naturally and more reasonably explained by other causes. Bees swarm,apparently, in the lead or under the influence of individuals; and it needs onlya pair of eyes to discover that there are plenty of individual laggards andblunderers in the process. They grow angry not all at once, but successively;not because a swarm instinct impels them to anger, but because one irritated beegives off a pungent odor or raises a militant buzzing, and the others smell theodor or hear the buzzing and are inflamed by it, each through his own senses andby the working of his own motives. On a hot day you will see a few bees fanningair into the hive with their wings, and when these grow weary others take theirplaces; but if it were a swarm instinct that impelled them, you would see allthe bees fanning or all sweltering at the same moment. As for the honey-makinginstinct, on any early-spring day you will find a few bees working in thenearest greenhouse, while the others, which are supposed to be governed by thesame collective impulse, are comfortably torpid in the hive or else eating honeyfaster than these enterprising ones can make it.I judge, therefore, that the communistic bees have some individual notions, andany show of individuality is so at variance with the common-impulse theory thatit seems to illustrate Spencer's definition of tragedy, which is, \"a theoryslain by a fact.\" In short, bees have our common social instinct highlydeveloped, or overdeveloped, and possibly they have also, like all the higherorders, a stronger or weaker instinct of imitation; but these are very differentmatters, more natural and more consistent with the facts than is the allegedswarm instinct.A scientific friend, the most observant ornithologist I have ever met, has justoffered an interesting explanation of the flock or herd phenomena we are hereconsidering. He finds little evidence of a swarm instinct, as distinct from ourfamiliar social instinct; but he has often marveled at the wing drill of birds,and has twice witnessed an alarm or warning of danger spread silently among aherd of scattered beasts; and he accounts for the observed facts by thesupposition that the minds (or what corresponds to the minds) of the lowerorders are often moved not from within, but from without—that is, not byinstinct or by sense impressions, not by what they or others of their kind maysee or hear, but by some external and unknown influence. My caribou rushed away,he thinks, and my incoming plover turned as one bird from my decoys, because awarning impulse fell upon them at a moment when they were in danger, but knew itnot; and they obeyed it, as they obey all their impulses, without consciousthought or knowledge of what they are doing or why they are doing it.Here is some suggestion of a very modern psychology which is inclined to regardthe mind as a thought-receiving rather than as a thought-producing instrument,and with that I have some sympathy; but here is also a rejuvenation of theincorporeal swarm instinct and other fantastic or romantic notions of animalswhich preclude observation. If the anima of a bird or beast is so constitutedthat it can receive impulses from a mysterious and unknown source, what is toprevent it from receiving such silent impulses from another anima like itself?And why seek an unseen agent for the warning to my caribou or my plover when oneof the creatures saw the danger and was enough moved by it to sound a mentaltocsin?The trouble with my friend's explanation, and with all others I have thus farheard or read, is twofold. First, like the swarm-impulse theory, it reallyexplains nothing, but avoids one mystery or difficulty by taking refuge inanother. There was a Hindu philosopher who used to teach, after the manner ofhis school, that the earth stood fast because it rested on the back of a greatelephant; which was satisfactory till a thoughtful child asked, \"But theelephant, what does he stand on?\" So when I see intelligent caribou or ploverfleeing from an unsensed danger, and am told that they have received an impulsefrom without, I am bound to ask, \"Where did that impulse come from, and who sentit?\" For emotional impulses do not drop like rain from the clouds, or fall likeapples from unseen trees; they must have their source in a living, intelligentbeing of some kind, who must feel the impulse before sending it to others. Noother explanation is humanly comprehensible.This leads to the second objection to the theory of external impulse, and toevery other notion of a collective or incorporeal swarm instinct—namely, that itcontradicts all the previous experience of the wild creature, or at least alleducative experience, which lies plain and clear to our observation. To eachbird and animal are given individual senses, individual wit and a personalanima; and each begins his mortal experience not in a great flock or herd, butalways in solitary fashion, under the care and guidance of a mother animal thathas a saving knowledge of a world in which the little one is a stranger. Thus, Iwatch the innocent fawn when it begins to follow the wary old doe, or thefledgling snipe as it leaves the nest under expert guidance, or the wonder-eyedcub coming forth from its den at the call of the gaunt old she-wolf. In eachcase I see a mother intelligently caring for her young, leading them to food,warding them from danger, calling them now to assemble or now to scatter; andbefore my eyes these ignorant youngsters quickly learn to adapt themselves tothe mother's ways and to obey her every signal. Sometimes I see them plainlywhen some manner of silent communication passes among them (something perhapsakin to that which passes when you catch a friend's eye and send your thought ororder to him across a crowded room), and it has even seemed to me, as recordedelsewhere in our observation of wolf and fox dens, that the young understandthis silent communication more readily than they learn the meaning of audiblecries expressive of food or danger.Such is the wild creature's earliest experience, his training to accommodatehimself to the world, and to ways that wiser creatures of his own kind havefound good in the world. When his first winter draws near he is led by hismother to join the herd or pack or migrating flock; and he is then ready not forsome mysterious new herd or flock instinct, but for the same old signals thathave served well to guide or warn him ever since he was born. I conclude,therefore, naturally and reasonably' that my caribou broke away and my incomingplover changed their flight because one of their number detected danger and sentforth a warning impulse, which the others obeyed promptly because they wereaccustomed to just such communications. There was nothing unnatural ormysterious or even new in the experience. So far as I can see or judge, there isno place or need for a collective herd or flock impulse, and the birds andbeasts have no training or experience by which to interpret such an impulse ifit fell upon them out of heaven.Our human experience, moreover, especially that which befalls on the borderlandof the subconscious world where the wild creatures mostly live, may give pointand meaning to our natural philosophy. There are emotions, desires, impulseswhich may be conveyed by shouting; and there are others which may well be toldwithout shouting, or even without words. A cheerful man radiates cheerfulness; astrong man, strength; a brave man, courage (we do not know to what extent orwith what limitations); and a woman may be more irritated by a man who saysnothing than by a man who says too much. These common daily trials may be asside-lights on the tremendous fact that love, fear, hate,—every intense emotionis a force in itself, a force to be reckoned with, apart from the cry or thelook by which it is expressed; that all such emotions project themselvesoutward; and that possibly, or very probably, there is some definite medium toconvey them, as an unknown medium which we call \"ether\" conveys the waves oflight.It is true that we habitually receive such emotional impulses from others bymeans of our eyes or ears; but sometimes we apparently imbibe them through ourskin, as Anthony Trollope said he learned Latin, and once in a way we receivethem from another without knowing or thinking of the process at all. It isnoteworthy that the most companionable people in the world are silent people,especially a silent friend, and that the silence of any man is invariably moreeloquent than his speech. The silence of one man rests you like a melody; thesilence of another bores you to yawning, perhaps because it is a \"dead\" silence;the quietude of a third excites your curiosity to such an extent that, for oncein your life, you behave like a perfectly natural animal; that is, you go roundthe silent one, as it were, view him mentally from all sides, sniff at hisopinions from leeward, whir your wings in his face like a sparrow, or stamp yourfoot at him like a rabbit—all this to stir him up and to uncover whatinteresting thing lies behind his silence. And why? Simply because every livingman is silently, unconsciously projecting his real thought or feeling, and youare unconsciously understanding it or else making a vain conscious effort inthat direction.Such experiences are commonly confined to a room, to the circle of an open fire;but they are not limited by necessity to any narrow reach, since there isnothing in a wall to hinder a man's love or hate from passing through, or in theair to check its far-going, or in the nature of another man to prevent itsreception. The influence of one person's unvoiced will or purpose or warning orsummons upon another person at a distance, should it turn out more common thanwe now believe possible because of our habit of speech, would be nothingunnatural or mysterious, but rather a true working of the subconscious or animalmind, which had its own way of communication before ever speech was invented.Whitman, who sometimes got hold of the tail end of philosophy (and who was wontto believe he could drag it out, like a trapped woodchuck, and whirl it aroundhis head with barbaric whoops), was often seen at the burrow of thisthought-transference doctrine:These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?Why are there men and women that while they are near me the sunlight expands myblood?Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descendupon me?What is it that I interchange so suddenly with strangers?What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by and pause?What gives me to be free to woman's and man's good-will? what gives them, to befree to mine?Again, our familiar human experience may throw some clearer light than evercomes from the laboratory of animal psychologists upon the action of gregariousbrutes in their so-called blind panics, when they are said to be governed bysome extraneous or non-individual herd impulse. How such a theory originated isa puzzle to one who has closely observed animals in the open, since their panicsare never \"blind,\" and their \"extraneous\" impulse may often be traced to analarmed animal of their own kind, or even to an excited human being, whoseemotions are animal-like both in their manifestation and in their irritatingeffect. A dog is more easily roused by human than by canine excitement. Afrightened rider sends his fear or irresolution in exaggerated form into thehorse beneath him. The herd of swine that ran down a steep place into the seawere possessed, I should say, not by exorcised demons, but by the hysteriareceived directly from some man or woman of the excited crowd in the immediateneighborhood. Panic is more infectious than any fever, and knows no barriersbetween brute and human. Indeed, in a frightened crowd in the Subway, in atheater where smoke appears, or in any other scene of emotional excitement, youmay in a few minutes observe actions more panicky, more suggestive of a herdimpulse (if there be such a fantastic thing in orderly nature), than can be seenin a whole lifetime of watching wild animals.In my head at this moment is the vivid impression of a night when I was caughtand carried away by a crowd of Italian socialists, twenty thousand frenzied menand a few ferocious women, that first eddied like a stormtide about the greatsquare under the cathedral at Milan, howling, shrieking, imprecating, and thenpoured tumultuously through choked streets to hurl paving-blocks at the innocentroof of the railroad station, as at a symbol of government. The roof was ofglass, and the clattering smash of it seemed to get on the nerves of men, likethe cry of sick-em! to an excited dog, rousing them to a senseless fury ofdestruction. Clear and thrilling above the tumult a bugle sang, like a note fromheaven, and into the seething mass of humanity charged a squadron of cavalry,striking left or right with the flats of their sabers, raising a new hubbub ofshrieks and imprecations as the weaker were trampled down. Fear? That crowd knewno more of fear just then than an upturned hive of bees. They met the chargewith a roar, a hoarse, solid shout that seemed to sweep the cavalry away likesmoke in the wind. Unarmed men swarmed at the horses like enraged baboons,hurling stones or curses as they went. The rush ended in a triumphant yell, andriderless horses, their eyes and nostrils aflame, went plunging, kicking,squealing through the pandemonium.There must have been something tremendously animal in the scene, after all; forwhen I recall it now I see, as if Memory had carved her statue of the event, anupreared horse with a crumpled rider toppling from the saddle; and I hear notthe shouts or curses of men, but the horrible scream of a maddened brute.It was the night, many years ago, when news of disaster to the Italian army atAdowa broke loose, after being long suppressed, and I learned then for the firsttime what emotional excitement means when the gates are all down. One had tohold himself against it, as against a flood or a mighty wind. To yield, to loseself-control even for an instant, was to find oneself howling, reaching forpaving-blocks, seeking an enemy, lifting a bare fist against charging horse orswinging steel, like the other lunatics. I caught a man by the shoulders, heldhim, and bade him in his own language tell me what the row was about; but heonly stared at me wildly, his mouth open. I caught another, and he struck at myface; a third, and he shrieked like a trapped beast. Only one gave me ahalf-coherent answer, a man whom I dragged from under a saber and pushed into aside-street. His dear Ambrogio had been conscripted by the government, he howled(I suppose they had sent his son or brother with a disaffected Milanese regimenton the African adventure), and they were all robbers, oppressors, murderers—hefinished by jerking loose from my grasp and hurling himself, yelling, into themob again.Had I been a visiting caribou, watching that amazing scene and knowing nothingof its motive, I might easily have concluded that some mysterious herd impulsewas driving all these creatures to they knew not what; but, being human, I knewperfectly well that even this unmanageable crowd had taken its cue from someleader; that the senseless emotion which inflamed them had originated withindividuals, who had some ground for their passion; and that from the individualthe excitement spread in pestilential fashion until the whole mob caught it andbent to it, as a field of grass bends to the storm.Therefore (and I hope you keep the thread of logic through a long digression),when I go as a man among caribou or wolves or plover or crows, and see the wholeherd or pack or flock acting as one, as if swayed by a single will, I see noreason why I should evoke an incorporeal swarm impulse, or \"call a spirit fromthe vasty deep\" of the unknown to explain their similarity of action, sincethere are natural causes which may account for the matter perfectly—familiarcauses, too, which still influence men and women as they influence the remotewood folk.No, this is not a new animal psychology; it is rather an attempt to banish thedelusion that there is any such thing as a distinct animal psychology. Sciencehas many forms, and still plenty of delusions, but there is a basic principle towhich she holds steadily—namely, that Nature is of one piece because her lawsare constant. It follows that, if you know anything of a surety about your ownmind, you may confidently apply the knowledge to any other mind in the universe,whether in the heavens above or the earth beneath or the waters under the earth.The only question is, How far may the term \"mind\" be properly applied to thebrute?That unanswered question does not immediately concern us, for in speaking ofmind we commonly mean the conscious or reasoning human article, and we aredealing here with the subconscious mind, which seems to work after the samefashion whether it appears on two legs or four. A dog does not know why hebecomes excited in a commotion that does not personally concern him, or why hefeels impelled to hasten to an outcry from an unknown source, or why he looksup, contrary to all his habits, when everybody else is looking up; and neitherdoes a man know why he does just such things. Man and brute both act inobedience to something deeper, more primal and more dependable than reason, andin this subconscious field they are akin; otherwise it would be impossible for aman ever to train or to understand a brute, and our companionable dogs would beas distant as the seraphim.When, therefore, the same unreasoning actions that are attributed to amysterious collective impulse among birds or animals are found among men todepend on a succession of individual impulses, it is good psychology as well asgood natural history to dismiss the whole herd instinct as another thoughtlessmyth. The familiar social and imitative instincts, the contagion of excitement,the outward projection of emotional impulses, the sensitive bodily nature of ananimal which enables him to respond to such impulses even when they areunaccompanied by a voice or cry,—these are comparatively simple and \"sensible\"matters which explain all the phenomena of flock or herd life more naturally andmore reasonably.image [images/9781591438984_009.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_034.jpg]VILOOKING back a moment on our trail of animal \"talk\" before following it onward,we see, first, that birds and beasts have certain audible cries which convey amore or less definite meaning of food or danger or assembly; and second, thatthey apparently have also some \"telepathic\" faculty of sending emotionalimpulses to others of their kind at a distance. The last has not been proved, tobe sure; we have seen little more than enough to establish it as a workinghypothesis; but whether we study science or history or an individual bird orbeast, it is better to follow some integrating method or principle than toblunder around in a chaos of unrelated details. And the hypothesis of silentcommunication certainly \"works,\" since it helps greatly to clarify certainobserved phenomena of animal life that are otherwise darkly mysterious.When the same dimly defined telepathic power appears in a man or woman—so rarelythat we are filled with wonder, as in the shadow of a great mystery or a greatdiscovery—it is not a new but a very old matter, I think, being merely asurvival or reappearance of a faculty that may have once been in common useamong gregarious creatures. All men seem to have some hint or suggestion oftelepathy in them, as shown by their ability to \"speak with their eyes\" or toinfluence their children by a look; and the few who have enough of it to beconspicuous receive it, undoubtedly, by some law or freak of heredity, such asenables one man in a million to wag his ears, or one in a thousand to follow asubconscious sense of direction so confidently that, after wandering about thebig woods all day, he turns at nightfall and heads straight for his camp like ahoming pigeon. The rest of us, meanwhile, by employing speech exclusively toexpress thought or emotion, and by habitually depending on five senses for allour impressions of the external world, have not only neglected but even lost allmemory of the gift that once was ours. As an inevitable consequence Nature hastaken her gift away, as she atrophies a muscle that is no longer used, ordevitalizes the nerve of sight in creatures, such as the fishes of Mammoth Cave,that have lived a long time in darkness.In previous chapters we have noted, as rare examples of telepathy in humansociety, that a mother may at times know when an absent son or husband is indanger, or that an African savage often knows when a stranger is approaching hisvillage hid in the jungle; but there is another manifestation of the samefaculty which is much more common, and which we have thus far overlooked,leaving it as an odd and totally unrelated thing without explanation. I refer tothe man, known in almost every village, who has some special gift for trainingor managing animals, who seems to know instinctively what goes on in a brute'shead, and who can send his own will or impulse into the lower mind. I wouldexplain that unrelated man, naturally, by the simple fact or assumption that hehas inherited more than usual of the animals' gift of silent communication.I knew one such man, a harmless, half-witted creature, who loved to roam thewoods alone by day or night, and whom the wild birds and beasts met with hardlya trace of the fear or suspicion they manifest in the presence of other humanbeings. He was always friendly, peaceable, childlike, and unconsciously orsubconsciously, I think, he could tame or influence these wild spirits byletting them feel his own.So also could an old negro, an ex-slave, with whom I used to go fox-hunting inmy student days. He could train a dog or a colt in a tenth part of the timerequired by ordinary men, and he used no whip or petting or feeding, or anyother device commonly employed by professional trainers. At times, indeed, hisanimals acted as if trained from the moment he touched or spoke to them. He hada mongrel lot of dogs, cats, chickens, pigs, cows and horses; but they were averitable happy family (on a cold night his cats would sleep with a setting hen,if they could find one, or otherwise with the foxhounds), and to see them allrunning to meet \"Uncle\" when he came home, or following at his heels or doingwhat he told them, was to wonder what strange animal language he was master of.At daybreak one winter morning I entered the old negro's kitchen very quietly,and had a fire going and coffee sending forth its aroma before I heard himcreaking down the stairs. I had traveled \"across lots,\" making no sound in thenew-fallen snow, and, as I approached the house, had purposely kept its darkbulk between me and the dogs, which were asleep in their kennel some distanceaway. For a time all was quiet as only a winter dawn can be; but as we sat downto breakfast one of the hounds with a big bass voice suddenly broke out in anearth-shaking jubilation. The other hounds quickly caught up the clamor, yellingas if they had just jumped a fox, while two dogs of another breed were strangelysilent; and then 'Poleon added his bit to the tumult by stamping, whinnying andfinally kicking lustily on the boards of his stall. 'Poleon, by the way, was anold white horse that Uncle used to ride (he was \"gittin' too rheumaticky,\" hesaid, to hunt with me afoot), and this sober beast was fair crazy to join thechase whenever a fox was afoot.The negro paid no attention to the noise; but as it went on increasing, and'Poleon whinnyed more wildly, and the big-voiced hound kept up a continuousbellow that might have roused the seven sleepers, the unseemly racket got on mynerves, so early in the day.'What the mischief is the matter with ]um this morning?\" I demanded.\"Matter? Mischief?\" echoed Uncle, as if surprised I did not understand suchplain animal talk. \"Why, ol' Jum's a-gwine fox-huntin' dis mawny. He reckons heknows what we-all's up to; and now de yother dawgs an' 'Poleon dey reckons deyknows it, too. Jum's tole um. Dat's all de matter an' de mischief.\"\"But how in the world should he know? You never go hunting now unless I temptyou, and none of the dogs saw or heard me come in,\" I objected.Uncle chuckled at that, chuckled a long time, as if it were a good joke. \"Trustol' Jum ter know when we-all's gwine fox-huntin',\" he said. \"You jes' trust him.I specks he kinder pick de idee outer de air soon's we thunk it, same's he picka fox scent. 'Tain't no use tryin' ter lie ter ]um, 'cause you can't fool 'imnohow. No, sir, when dat ol' dawg's eroun', you don' wanter think erbout nothin'you don want 'im ter now.I had often marveled at Uncle, but now suddenly I thought I understood him. Inhis unconscious confession that he thought or felt with his animals, rather thanspoke English to them, was probably the whole secret of his wonderful gift oftraining.The same \"secret\" is shared by the few men who have the gift of managing horses,and who can do more by a word or even a look than another man by bit andharness. I have heard the gift described by a professional horse-trainer as the\"power of the human eye\"; but that is nonsense set to melodrama. An eye is a bitof jelly, and means nothing without a will or communicating impulse behind it.When the spirit of a horse is once broken (and most of them are broken ratherthan trained by our methods) almost anybody can manage him, the blind as well asthe seeing; but when a horse keeps the spirit of his wild ancestors, theirtimidity, their flightiness, their hair-trigger tendency to shy or to bolt, thenI envy the man who can cross the gulf of ages and put something of his ownsteadiness into the nervous brute.This steadying process seems to be wholly a matter of spirit, so far as I haveobserved it, and whatever passes from man to brute passes directly, without needof audible speech. For example, a friend of mine, a very quiet man of few words,once brought home a magnificent \"blooded\" horse which he had bought for a songbecause \"nobody could handle him.\" The horse was not vicious in any way, butseemed to have a crazy impulse to run himself to death—an impulse so strong thateven now, when he is past twenty years old, he cannot be turned loose for amoment in a farm pasture. He had never been driven save with a powerful curb;even so, he would drag the carriage along by the reins, and an hour of suchdriving left a strong man's arms half paralyzed by the strain. Yet at the firsttrial his new owner put a soft rubber bit in his mouth, flipped the linesloosely across his back, and controlled him by a word.Some years later I was riding behind that same horse, jogging quietly along acountry road, when my friend, with an odd twinkle in his eye, said, \"Take thereins a moment while I get out this robe.\" I took them, and what followed seemedlike magic or bedevilment. I had noticed that the reins were loose, just\"feeling\" the horse's mouth; I shifted them to my hand very quietly, withoutstirring a hair, and blinders on the bridle prevented the horse from seeing thetransfer. Yet hardly had I touched them when something from my hand (or from mysoul, for aught I know) flowed along the leather and filled the brute with fire.He flung up his head, as if I had driven spurs into him, and was away like ashot.Again, I was crossing the public square of Nantucket one morning when I saw acrowd of excited men and boys eddying at a safe distance around a horse—an ugly,biting brute that had once almost torn the side of my face off when I passed tooclose to him, minding my own affairs. Now he was having one of his regulartantrums, squealing, kicking, plunging or backing, while his driver, who hadleaped to the ground, alternately lashed and cursed him. I heard an angry voicenear me utter the single word \"Fools!\" and saw a stranger brush some men asideand stand directly in front of the horse, which grew quiet on the instant. Thestranger went nearer, pulled the horse's head down and laid his face against it;and there they stood, man and brute, like carved statues. It was as if one werewhispering a secret, and the other listening. Then the man said, \"Come along,boy,\" and walked down the square, the horse following at his heels like atrained dog.Watching the scene, my first thought was that the horse recognized a former andkinder master; but the man assured me, when I followed him up, that he had neverspoken to the animal till that moment, and that he could do the same with anyrefractory horse he had ever met. \"Try it with that one,\" I said promptly,pointing to a nervous horse that, feeling the excitement of the recent affair,was jerking and frothing at his hitchrope. The man smiled his acceptance of thechallenge, stepped in front of the horse, and looked at him steadily. What hethought or willed, what feeling or impulse he sent out, I know not; butcertainly some silent communication passed, which the horse recognized byforward-pointing ears and a low whinny of pleasure. Then the man unsnapped therope from the bridle ring, turned away without a word, and the horse followedhim across the square and back again to the hitching-post.When I asked how the thing was done, the man answered with entire frankness thathe did not know. It \"just came natural\" to him, he said, to understand horses,and he had always been able to make them do almost anything he wanted. But hehad no remarkable power over other animals, so far as I could learn, and wasuncommonly shy of dogs, even of little dogs, regarding them all alike asworthless or dangerous brutes.Some of my readers may recall, in this connection, the shabby, genteel old manwho used to amuse visitors in the public gardens of Paris by playing with thesparrows, some twenty-odd years ago. So long as he went his way quietly thebirds paid no more attention to him than to any other stroller; but the momenthe began to chirp some wild and joyous excitement spread through the trees. Fromall sides the sparrows rushed to him, alighting on his hat or shoulders,clamoring loudly for the food which they seemed to know was in his pockets, butwhich he would not at first give them. When he had a crowd of men and womenwatching him (for he was vain of his gift, and made a small living by passinghis hat after an entertainment) he would single out a cock-sparrow from theflock and cry, \"What! you here again, Bismarck, you scoundrel?\" Then he wouldabuse the cock-sparrow, calling him a barbarian, a Prussian, a mannerlessintruder who had no business among honorable French sparrows; and finally,pretending to grow violently angry, he would chase Bismarck from bench to benchand throw his hat at him. And Bismarck would respond by dodging the hat,chirping blithely the while, as if it were a good joke, and would fly back topeck at the crust of bread which the old man held between his lips or leftsticking out of his pocket.One might have understood this as a mere training trick if Bismarck were alwaysthe same; but he was any cock-sparrow that the man chanced to pick out of aflock. After playing with the birds till they wearied of it, he would feed them,pass the hat, and stroll away to repeat his performance with another flock inanother part of the gardens. That these wary and suspicious birds, far moredistrustful of man than the sparrows of the wilderness, understood his mentalattitude rather than his word or action; that he could make them feel hiskindliness, his camaraderie, his call to come and play, even while he pretendedto chase them,—this was the impression of at least one visitor who watched himagain and again at his original entertainment.Some kind of communication must have passed silently between the actor and oneof his audience; for presently, though I never spoke to the old man, but onlywatched him keenly, he picked me out for personal attention. Whereupon Icultivated his acquaintance, invited him to dine and fed him like a duke, andthought I had gained his confidence by taking him to see a big wolf of mine thatmight well have puzzled any student of birds or beasts. The wolf was one of awild pack that had recently arrived at the zoo from Siberia, where they had beencaught in a pit and shipped away with all their savagery in them. Through somefreak of nature this one wolf had attached himself to me, like a lost dog; bysome marvelously subtle perception he would recognize my coming at a distance,even in a holiday crowd, and would thrust his grim muzzle against the bars ofhis cage to howl or roar till I came and stretched out a hand to him, though hewas as wild and \"slinky\" as the rest of the pack to everybody else, even to thekeeper who fed him. That interested the sparrow-tamer, of course; but he wassilent or too garrulous whenever I approached the thing I wanted to know. Hewould not tell me how he won the birds, but made a mystery and hocus-pocus ofthe natural gift by which he earned a precarious living.The same \"mystery\" cropped out later, amid very different scenes, in theinterior of Newfoundland. Coming down beside a salmon river one day, my Indian,a remarkable man with an almost uncanny power of calling wild creatures of everykind, pointed to a hole high on the side of a stub, and said, \"Go, knock-umdere; see if woodpecker at home.\" I went and knocked softly, but nothinghappened. \"Knock-um again, knock-um little louder,\" said Matty. I knocked again,more lustily, and again nothing happened. Then the Indian came and rapped thetree with his knuckles, while I stood aside; and instantly a woodpecker that wasbrooding her eggs stuck her head out of the hole and looked down at her visitorinquisitively.The next day at the same place we repeated the same performance precisely, afterour morning fishing; and again the interesting thing to me was, not the bird'sinstant appearance at the Indian's summons, but the curiously intent way inwhich she turned her head to look down at him. When he showed his craft againand again, at the doors of other woodpeckers that were not interested in myknocking, I demanded, \"Now, Matty, tell me how you do it.\"But Matty only laughed. When we are alone in the woods he has a fine sense ofhumor, though grim enough at other times. \"Oh, woodpecker know me; he look downat me,\" he said; and that was all I could ever get out of him.So, though I have seen the gift in operation several times, I have not yet foundthe man who had it and who could or would give me any explanation. There is nodoubt in my own mind, however, that the negro, the Frenchman, and the Indian,and all others who exercise any unusual influence over animals, do so by reasonof their subconscious power to \"talk\" or to convey impulses without words, asgregarious wild creatures commonly talk among themselves. At least, I canunderstand much of what I see among birds and brutes by assuming that they talkin this fashion.image [images/9781591438984_006.jpg]Such a power seems mysterious, incredible, in a civilized world of sense andnoise; but I fancy that every man and woman speaks silently to the brute withoutbeing conscious of the fact. \"If you want to see game, leave your gun at home,\"is an accepted saying among hunters; but the reason for the excellent admonitionhas not been forthcoming. When you have hunted six days in vain, and then on aquiet Sunday stroll come plump upon noble game that seems to have no fear, youare apt to think of the curiosities of luck, but even here also are you underthe sway of psychological law and order. As you go quietly through the woods,projecting your own \"aura\" of peace or sympathy, it may be, in an invisible waveahead of you, there is nothing disturbing or inharmonious in either yourthoughts or your actions; and at times the wild animal seems curiously able tounderstand the one as well as the other, just as certain dogs know at firstglance whether a stranger is friendly or hostile or afraid of them. When you areexcited or lustful to kill, something of your emotional excitement seems toprecede you; it passes over many wild birds and beasts, all delicatelysensitive, before you come within their sense range; and when you draw nearenough to see them you often find them restless, suspicious, though as yet notangible warning of danger has floated through the still woods. At the firstglimpse or smell of you they bound away, your action in hiding or creepingmaking evident the danger which thus far was only vaguely felt. But if youapproach the same animals gently, without mental excitement of any kind,sometimes, indeed, they promptly run away, especially in a much-hunted region;but more frequently they meet you with a look of surprise; they move alertlyhere or there to get a better view of you, and show many fascinating signs ofcuriosity before they glide away, looking back as they go.Such has been the illuminating experience of one man, at least, repeated ahundred times in the wilderness. I have been deep in the woods when myfood-supply ran low, or was lost in the rapids, or went to feed an uninvitedbear, and it was then a question of shoot game or go hungry; but the shootingwas limited by the principle that a wild animal has certain rights which a manis bound to respect. I have always held, for example, that a hunter has noexcuse for trying long shots that are beyond his ordinary skill; that it isunpardonable of him to \"take a chance\" with noble game or to \"pump lead\" afterit, knowing as he does that the chances are fifty to one that, if he hits atall, he will merely wound the animal and deprive it of that gladness of freedomwhich is more to it than life. So when I have occasionally gone out to kill abuck (a proceeding which I heartily dislike) I have sometimes hunted for daysbefore getting within close range of the animal I wanted. But when, in the sameregion and following the same trails, I have entered the big woods with no otherobject than to enjoy their stillness, their fragrance, their benediction, it isseldom that I do not find plenty of deer, or that I cannot get as near as Iplease to anyone of them. More than once in the woods I have touched a wild deerwith my hand (as recorded in another chapter) and many times I have had themwithin reach of my fishing-rod.It is even so with bear, moose, caribou and other creatures—your best \"shots\"come when you are not sots expecting them, and it is not chance, butpsychological law, which determines that you shall see most game when you leaveyour gun at home. A hunter must be dull indeed not to have discovered that theanimal he approaches peaceably, trying to make his eyes or his heart sayfriendly things, is a very different animal from the one he stalks with musclestense and eyes hard and death in the curl of his trigger finger.I once met an English hunter, a forest officer in India, who told me that forthe first year of his stay in the jungle he was \"crazy\" to kill a tiger. Hedreamed of the creatures by night; he hunted them at every opportunity and inevery known fashion by day; he never went abroad on forest business without aready rifle; and in all that time he had just one glimpse of a running tiger.One day he was led far from his camp by a new bird, and as he watched it in alittle opening, unarmed and happy in his discovery, a tiger lifted its huge headfrom the grass, not twenty steps away. The brute looked at him steadily for afew moments, then moved quietly aside, stopped for another look, and leaped forcover.That put a new idea into the man's head, and the idea was emphasized by the factthat the unarmed natives, who had no desire to meet a tiger, were frequentlyseeing the brutes in regions where he hunted for them in vain. As an experimenthe left his rifle at home for a few months; he practised slipping quietlythrough the jungle without physical or mental excitement, as the natives go, andpresently he, too, began to meet tigers. In one district he came close to fourin as many months, and everyone acted in the same half-astonished,half-inquisitive way. Then, thinking he understood his game, he began to carryhis rifle again, and had what he called excellent luck. The beautiful tigerskins he showed me were a proof of it.To me this man was a rare curiosity, being the only Indian or African hunter Iever met who went into the jungle alone, man fashion, and who did not depend onunarmed natives or beaters or trackers for finding his game. His excellent\"luck\" was, as I judge, simply a realization of the fact that human excitementmay carry far in the still woods, and be quite as disturbing, as the man-scentor the report of a rifle.Does all this sound strange or incredible to you, like a chapter from adream-book? However it may sound, it is the crystallized conviction resultingfrom years of intimate observation of wild beasts in their native woods; and ifyou consider it a moment without prejudice, it may appear more natural orfamiliar, like a chapter from life. If the man who sits opposite you can sendhis good or evil will across a room, so that you feel his quality without words,or if he can so express himself silently when he enters your gate that certaindogs instantly take his measure and welcome or bite him, it is not at allimprobable that the same man can project the same feelings when he goes afield,or that sensitive wild creatures can understand or \"feel him out\" at aconsiderable distance.To weigh that probability fairly you must first get rid of your ancient huntinglore. Hunters are like the Medes and Persians in that they have laws which alternot; and I suppose if you met ancient Nimrod in the flesh, his admonition wouldbe, \"Keep to leeward and stalk carefully, breaking no twig, for your game willrun away if it winds or hears you.\" That is the first rule I learned forbig-game hunting, and it is founded on fact. But there are two other facts Ihave observed these many years, which Nimrod will never mention: the first, thatwhen you are keenly hunting, it often happens that game breaks away in alarmbefore it winds or sees or hears you; and the second, that when you are nothunting, but peaceably roving the woods, going carelessly and paying noattention to the wind, you often come very close to wild game, which stops towatch you curiously after it has seen you and heard your step or voice andsampled your quality in the air. These two facts, implying some kind of mentalor emotional contact between the natural man and the natural brute, are probablynot accidental or unrelated, and we are here trying to find the natural law orprinciple of which they are the occasional and imperfect expression.This whole matter of silent communication may appear less strange if we rememberthat most wild creatures are all their lives accustomed to matters whichsense-blinded mortals find mysterious or incredible. Why a caterpillar, whichlives but a few hours when all the leaves are green, should make a cocoon of asingle leaf and with a thread of silk bind that leaf to its stem before he wrapshimself up in it, as if he knew that every leaf must fall; or why a spider,adrift for the first time on a chip, should immediately send out filaments onthe air currents and, when one of his filaments cleaves to something solidacross the water, pull himself and his raft ashore by it; or why a young bear,which has never seen a winter, should at the proper time prepare a den for hislong winter sleep,—a thousand such matters, which are as ABC to naturalcreatures, are to us as incomprehensible as hieroglyphics to an Eskimo. That asensitive animal should know by feeling (that is, by the reception of a silentmessage) whether an approaching animal is in a dangerous or a harmless mood isreally no more remarkable than that he should know, as he surely does, when itis time for him to migrate or to make ready his winter quarters.This amazing sensitiveness, resulting, I think, from the reception of a wordlessmessage, was brought strongly home to me one day as I watched a flock of blackmallards, forty or fifty of them, resting in the water-grass within a few yardsof my hiding-place. A large hawk had appeared at intervals, circling over themarshes and occasionally over the pond; but, beyond turning an eye upward whenhe came too near, the ducks apparently paid no attention to him. He was theirnatural enemy; they had paid toll of their number to satisfy his hunger; butnow, though plainly seen, he was no more regarded or feared than a dragon-flybuzzing among the reeds. Presently another hawk appeared in the distance,circling above the meadows. As a wider swing brought him over the pond awatchful duck uttered a single low quock! On the instant heads came from underwings; a few ducks shot into the open water for a look; others sprang aloftwithout looking, and the whole flock was away in a twinkling. I think the hawkdid not see or suspect them till they rose in the air, for at the suddencommotion he swooped, checked himself when he saw that he was too late, andclimbed upward where he could view the whole marsh again.Now these two hawks were of the same species, and to my eyes they were actingvery much alike. One was hungry, on the lookout for food; the other was circlingfor his own amusement after having fed; and though the eyes of birds areuntrustworthy in matters of such fine distinction, in some way these ducksinstantly knew or felt the difference between the mood of one enemy and that ofanother. Likewise, when I have been watching deer in winter, I have seen a doethrow up her head, cry an alarm and bound away; and her action becamecomprehensible a few moments later when a pack of hunting wolves broke out ofthe cover. But I have watched deer when a pack of wolves that were not huntingpassed by in plain sight, and beyond an occasional lift of the head for an alertglance the timid creatures showed no sign of alarm, or even of uneasiness, inpresence of their terrible enemies.I say confidently that one wolf pack was hunting and the other not huntingbecause the northern timber-wolf naturally (that is, in a wild state and dealingwith wild animals) hunts or kills only when he is hungry. I ran the trails ofboth packs, and one showed plainly that the wolves were in search of food; whilethe other said that the brutes were roaming the country idly, lazily; and when Iran the back trail of this second pack I found where they had just killed andeaten. The deer were not afraid of them because they were for the time quiteharmless.At first I thought that these ducks and deer perceived the mood of their enemiesin a simple way through the senses; that they could infer from the flight of ahawk or the trot of a wolf whether he were peaceable or dangerous; and at timesthis is probably the true explanation of the matter. The eyes of most birds andbeasts, strangely dull to objects at rest, are instantly attracted to anyunusual motion. If the motion be quiet, steady, rhythmical, they soon loseinterest in it, unless it be accompanied by a display of bright color; but ifthe motion be erratic, or if it appear and disappear, as when an approachinganimal hides or creeps, they keep sharp watch until they know what the motionmeans or until timidity prompts them to run away. Thus, chickens or ducks showalarm when a kite slants up into the air; they lose interest when the kite sitsin the wind, and become alert again when it begins to dive or swoop. It isnoticeable, also, that on a windy day all gamebirds and animals are uncommonlywild and difficult of approach, partly because the constant motion of leaves orgrass upsets them, and partly (in the case of animals) because their noses areat fault, the air messages being constantly broken up and confused. But such a\"sensible\" explanation, suitable as it may be for times or places, no longersatisfies me, and simply because it does not explain why on a quiet day gameshould be unconcerned in presence of one hawk or wolf, and take to instantflight on the appearance of another enemy of the same species.It should be noted here that these \"fierce\" birds and beasts are no more savagein killing grouse or deer than the grouse is savage in eating bugs, or the deerin seeking mushrooms at the proper season; that they simply seek their naturalmeat when they are hungry, and that they are not bloodthirsty or ferocious orwanton killers. Only men, and dogs trained or spoiled by men, are open to thatcharge. The birds and beasts of prey when not hungry (which is a large part ofthe time, since they feed but once a day or sometimes at longer intervals) liveas peaceably as one could wish. After feeding they instinctively seek to be withtheir own kind and very rarely attempt to molest other creatures. At such times,when they are resting or playing or roving the woods, the smaller wood folk payno more attention to them than to harmless fish-hawks or porcupines*6[9781591438984_ftn.htm#ftn6]. Repeatedly I have watched game-birds or animalswhen their enemies were in sight, and have wondered at their fearlessness. Theinteresting question is, How do they know, as they seemingly do, when thefull-fed satisfaction of their enemy changes to a dangerous mood? Why, forexample, are deer alarmed at the yelp of a she-wolf calling her cubs to thetrail, and why do they feed confidently in the dusk-filled woods, as I have seenthem do, when the air shivers and creeps to the clamor of a wolf pack bayinglike unleashed hounds in wild jubilation?I have no answer to the question, and no explanation except the one suggested byhuman experience: that the hunting animal, like the hunting man, probably sendssomething of his emotional excitement in a wave ahead of him, and that someanimals are finely sensitive enough to receive this message and to be vaguelyalarmed by it.image [images/9781591438984_006.jpg]The mating of animals, especially the calling of an unseen mate from a greatdistance, brings us face to face with the same problem, and perhaps also thesame answer. Sometimes the mating call is addressed to the outer ear, as in thedrumming of a cock-grouse or the whine of a cow-moose; but frequently a mateappears when, so far as we can hear, there is no audible cry to call him. How dothe butterflies, for example, know when or where to seek their other halves?That their meeting is by chance or blunder or accident is a theory which hardlyendures an hour's observation. In the early spring I take a cocoon from acertain corner of shrubbery and carry it to my house, and there keep it till theend softens, when I put it into a box with a screened top and hang it out underthe trees. Presently a gorgeous moth crawls out of the cocoon; and hardly hasshe begun to wave her wings to dry them when the air over the screen isbrilliant with dancing wings, the wings of her would-be mates. And the thing ismore puzzling to me because I have never found a cocoon of that kind in myimmediate neighborhood; nor have I seen a single cecropia this season until thecaptive called them.How they find her so promptly is a problem that I cannot solve. It may be thatthe call is wholly physical or sensible, that some fine dust or aroma is sentforth on the air currents, and the sensitive nerves of other moths receive andrespond to it; but it is still amazing that wind-blown creatures can follow aninvisible air-trail through what must be to them a constant tempest andwhirlwind of air currents, until they come unerringly to the one desired spot ina limitless universe. I have shown that pretty sight of dancing wings to manyaudiences, after predicting what would happen; and always they saw it withwonder, as if there were magic in it.The moth mystery may be dissolved by some such purely physical formula; but whatphysical sense will explain the fact that when I turned a modest hen-pheasantloose in the spring, in a region where my wide-ranging setter and I neverdiscovered a pheasant, she was immediately joined by a gloriously colored mate,and soon there was a hidden nest and then young pheasants to watch? Most birdsand beasts are questing widely in the mating season, and their senses seem to bemore keen at this time, or more concentrated on a single object. On grounds ofwhat we thoughtlessly call chance, therefore, they would be more apt to findmates when they are keenly looking for them; but giving them every possiblechance in a wide region where the species is almost extinct, and thenmultiplying that chance a hundred times, I still find it hard to believe thatthe meeting of two rare animals is either accidental or the result of ordinarysense-perception. Out of several examples that occur to me, here are two whichespecially challenge the attention:One early spring a she-fox was caught in her den, some five miles from thevillage where I then harbored. She was carefully bagged, carried a few rods toan old wood road, placed in a wagon and driven over country highways to thevillage, where she was confined in a roomy pen in a man's dooryard. A few nightslater came a snowfall, and in the morning there were the tracks of a male foxheading straight to the vixen and making a path round about her pen. She was hismate, presumably, and when we found his tracks our first feeling of admirationat his boldness was soon replaced by the puzzling question of how he had foundher so quickly and so surely. To answer that question, if possible, I followedhis back trail.Now the trail of a fox in the wilderness, where he is sometimes hunted by wolvesor other hungry prowlers, is a bewildering succession of twistings andcrisscrosses; in a settled region, where his natural enemies are extinct, histrail is bolder, more straightforward, easier to read; and in either case youcan quickly tell by the \"signs\" whether your fox is male or female, whetherhunting or roaming, or hungry or satisfied. Also you can tell whether he is just\"projeckin' around,\" as Uncle Remus says, or whether his mind is set on goingsomewhere. In the latter event he almost invariably follows runways, or foxroads, which are as well known to him as are footpaths and stream-crossings to acountry lad. But the trail of this particular fox was different from any otherthat I ever followed. That he was a male and was \"going somewhere\" was evidentenough; but he was not following runways or paying any attention to them. Heleft no signs at places where any ordinary dog-fox would surely have left them,and he was stopping to listen or to ward himself at uncommonly frequentintervals. So, running it backward, I read the story of his journey mile aftermile, till the oncoming trail changed to the devious, rambling trot of aquesting fox; and beyond that I had no interest in it.The place where the fox seemed to have found his bearings, or where he stoppedhis rambling to head straight for his mate, was some four miles distant from thecaptive in a bee-line. The course he took was entirely different from that takenby the man who brought the vixen home, thus excluding the theory that hefollowed the trail by scent; and the latter part of his way led through theoutskirts of a village, where the track of a fox had not been seen for manyyears. From the distant hills he had come down through sheltering woods at astealthy trot; across open pastures on the jump; over a bridge and along ahighway, where he traveled behind a friendly stone wall; then very cautiouslythrough lanes and garden fringes, where the scent of men and dogs met him atevery turn; turning aside here for a difficulty or there for a danger, butholding his direction as true as if he followed a compass, till he came at lastwith delicate steps to where his mate was silently calling him. For except onthe assumption that she called him, and with a cry that was soundless, I knownot how to explain the fact that he found her in a place where neither he norshe had ever been before.It is possible, you may reason, that this was not his first visit; that unknownto us, venturing among his human and canine enemies, he had by a lucky chancestumbled upon his mate on an evening when the bare ground did not betray hissecret to our eyes; and that for his next visit he had cunningly laid out adifferent trail through manifold dangers. It was the latter trail, made withoutdoubt or question of what lay at the end of it, which I had followed in thetelltale snow.That is a good armchair argument, but a very doubtful explanation of the foxaction, since it calls for more reasoning power than we commonly find in abrute. Remember that this male fox was far away on his own affairs when his matewas captured, and he had no means of knowing where she had gone: he simplymissed her from her accustomed haunts, and sought till he found her. Rememberalso that a male fox is never allowed to come near his mate's den; that when sheis heavy with young, as this vixen was when caught, he may join her of anevening and hunt for her, or bring her food that he has killed, but always, Ithink, at a distance from the place where she intends to bring forth her cubs.That the male, after missing his mate and yapping for her in vain through thewoods, should at last seek her at the forbidden den, and there find the scent ofmen and conclude that they had taken her away; that he should follow the scentof a wagon-wheel over five miles of country roads, or else explore all theneighboring villages till he found what he sought; that he should then layout adifferent trail, more secret and more reasonably safe, for his second visit,—allthis is to me more ingenious, more unnatural and more incredible than that hismate should silently call him, as his mother had probably many times called himfrom the den when he was a cub, and that he should feel and answer her summons.Such reasoning is purely speculative, but there are certain facts which we mustkeep in mind if we are to explain the matter. The first, a general fact which isopen to observation, is that it is fox nature at certain seasons to come to acaptive; for what reason or with what self-forgetful motive it would be hard tosay. I have known mother foxes and mother wolves to come where their cubs wereimprisoned by men. I have heard a straight record of one male wolf that appearedat a ranch the second night after his wounded mate was captured by the ranchman.And I have seen a male fox come to the rescue of a female when she was driven bydogs and too heavy with young to make a long run, and wait beside her trail tillthe dogs appeared, and then lead them off after him while she made her escape.The second fact, which may imply some power of silent communication, is thatwhen snow fell about the pen of this captive fox, a few nights after she wastaken, there were the tracks to show that her mate already knew where she was.That he found and came to her in the midst of his enemies may be quite assignificant as how he found her, by way of giving a new direction or interest toour skin-and-bones study of natural history.In this first example the fox was perhaps moved by the mating impulse, whichsharpened his wit and encouraged his will; but at times a wild creature may seekand find his mate when no such \"call of the blood\" urges him, when he comes withhis life in his hand in response to some finer or nobler motive, somethingperhaps akin to loyalty, which is the sum of all virtues. Witness the following:image [images/9781591438984_021.jpg]The old vixen lies apart where she can overlook the play and the neighborhood.image [images/9781591438984_022.jpg]He flings out a single “Haw!” and the ducks spring aloft on the instant and headswiftly out to sea.image [images/9781591438984_023.jpg]A shadow moved from the darker shadow of an upturned root—and a great bull stoodalert on the open shore.image [images/9781591438984_024.jpg]They stood tense as they searched the plain and surrounding woods for the sourceof danger.image [images/9781591438984_025.jpg]The course he took was entirely different from that taken by the man who broughtthe vixen home.image [images/9781591438984_026.jpg]So innocent and so appealing that it is hard to keep your hands from him.image [images/9781591438984_027.jpg]His massive head thrust forward as he tried to penetrate the far distance withhis near-sighted eyes.image [images/9781591438984_028.jpg]At such a time my pond seemed to awaken and shed its silence like a garment.A friend of mine was hunting one October day when his shot wing-tipped a quail,apparently the old female of the flock, which his dog caught and brought to himalmost uninjured. What to do was the next question. It is easy, becausethoughtless, to cut down a bird in swift flight; but when the little thingnestles down in your hand or tries to hide under your fingers; when you can feelits rapid heart-beat, and its eyes are big and wondrous bright,—well, then somehunters bite the head, and some wring the neck, and some would for the moment aslief be shot as to do either. So to avoid the difficulty my friend put the quailcarefully away in a pocket of his hunting-coat, and brought her home with somevague idea of taming her, and some dream of trapping a mate in the spring andperhaps raising some little bob-whites of his own. At night he put the captiveinto a coop just inside the barn window, which was open wide enough to admit airbut not a prowling cat; for he was already beginning to learn that a quail is amost lovable little pet, and he was bound that she should not again be hurt orfrightened.Before sunrise next morning he heard low, eager whistlings in the yard; andthere was another quail, a male bob-white, where never one was seen before norsince. He was perched warily on the window-sill of the barn, looking in at hiscaptive mate, telling her in the softest of quail tones (for there were enemiesall about) that he had found her and was glad; while from within the barn came asoft piping and gurgling which seemed to speak welcome and reassurance. Theopening of a door frightened him; he buzzed away to the orchard, and presentlyfrom an apple-tree came the exquisite quoi-lee! quoi-lee! -the assembly-call ofthe bob—white family.The first quail had been caught miles away from the man's house; there were noother birds of her own kind within hearing distance, so far as my friend and hisdog ever discovered, and it was not the mating-time, when quail are questingwidely. By a process of elimination, therefore, one reaches the conclusion thatthe male bird was, in all probability, the father of the flock over which thecaptive presided; that he had helped to raise the young birds, as quail commonlydo; that he had stood by his family all summer in loyal bob-white fashion, andthat he went out to seek his vanished mate when she failed to answer hiscalling.All that seems clear enough, and in perfect accord with quail habits; but whenyou ask, \"How did he find her?\" there is no answer except the meaningless word\"chance\" or a frank admission of our original premise: that wild birds andbeasts all exercise a measure of that mysterious telepathic power whichreappears now and then in some sensitive man or woman. It may be for the woodfolk that \"There is no speech nor language: their voice is not heard,\" as thePsalmist wrote of the communing day and night; but they certainly communicate insome way, and the longer one studies them the more does it appear that part oftheir \"talk\" is of a finer character than that which our ears can hear.image [images/9781591438984_010.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"> image [images/9781591438984_036.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_037.jpg]VIITO know birds and beasts may be a greater or a lesser triumph than to knowornithology or zoölogy. That is a question of taste or temperament, the onlycertainty being that the two classes of subjects are altogether different. Thelatter deals with external matters, with form, classification, generalities. Itsmaterials are books, specimens, museums, one as dead or desiccate as another;and because it is limited and exact, you can memorize its outlines in a fewdays, or become in a few years an authority in the science.The former subject, of birds and beasts, deals with an endless and fascinatingmystery. Its materials are living and joyous individuals, among whom are noclasses or species, concerning whom there can be no \"authority\"; and when, aftera lifetime of study, you have made a small beginning of knowledge, you findthat, like All Gaul of misty memory, it may be divided into three parts.One part is observation, which is a simple matter of the eye. Another issympathy, which belongs to the mind or heart. In dealing with wild creatures, aswith civilized folk, one learns to appreciate De Qyincey's rule of criticism,\"Not to sympathize is not to understand.\" A third part, more rare and variable,may come from that penetrating but indescribable quality which we call a gift. Afew men have it; the animals instinctively trust them, and they understandanimals without knowing how they understand. The rest, lacking it, must struggleagainst a handicap to learn, substituting the slow wisdom of experience for thequick insight of the gift. It is for the latter chiefly that I write these woodnotes.One word more by way of preface, to express the conviction that you can learnnothing worth knowing about birds or beasts so long as you seek them with a gunin your hand. On that road you shall find only common dust, and at the end of ita valley of dry bones. Whether you carry the gun frankly for sport, or deludeyourself with the notion that you can add to natural history by collecting moreskins or skulls, you have unconsciously placed destruction above fulfilment,stark death above the beautiful mystery of life. So must you estrange both theanimal and yourself, making it impossible for you to meet on any common groundof understanding. And now for our lessons:image [images/9781591438984_006.jpg]If I were to formulate rules for a subject which can never be learned by thebook, I might say that there are three things you should know, and another youmust do, if you expect to gain any intimate knowledge of the wood folk, or evento approach them near enough for fair and leisurely observation.The first thing to know is that natural creatures, though instinctively shy ortimid, are not wildly governed by fears and terrors, as we have been misinformedfrom our youth up. The \"reign of terror\" is another of those pet scientificdelusions, like the \"struggle for existence,\" for which there is no basis innature. Fear in any true sense of the word is an exclusively human possession,or affliction; it is a physical and moral poison, as artificial as sin, whichthe animal escapes by virtue of being natural. It is doubtful, indeed, whetheranything remotely resembling our fear, a state of mind arising from a highlydeveloped imagination which enables us to picture events before they happen, isever born into a hairy skin or hatched out of an egg. The natural timidity ofall wild creatures is a protective and wholesome instinct, radically differentfrom the fear which makes cowards of men who have learned to trace causes and toanticipate consequences.So much for the mental analysis; and your eyes emphasize the same conclusionwhen you look frankly upon the natural world. The very attitude or visibleexpression of birds or beasts when you meet them in their native woods, feeding,playing, resting, seeking their mates, or roving freely with their little ones(all pleasurable matters, constituting nine-tenths or more of animal existence),is enough in itself to refute the absurd notion of a general reign of terror innature. If you are wise, therefore, you will get rid of that prejudice, or atleast hold it in abeyance till the animals themselves teach you how senseless itis. To go out obsessed with the notion of fear is to blind your eyes to thegreat comedy of the woods.The second thing to know, and to remember when you go forth to see, is thatsensitive creatures dislike to be watched, and become uneasy when they find apair of eyes intently fixed upon them. You yourself retain something of thisancient animal inheritance, it seems, since there is nothing which more surelyexcites alarm if you are timid, or challenge if you are well balanced, or angerif you have a fighting spirit, than to have a stranger watching your every movewhile you go about your lawful affairs. The fact that you cannot word a reasonfor your alarm or challenge or anger makes you all the more certain that youhave an unanswerable reason; which is your inborn right to be let alone.This natural and inalienable right (which society curbs for its own protection,and reform societies trample on for their peculiar pleasure) may help you tounderstand why the animal becomes alarmed when he finds you watching himclosely. He desires above all things else, above his dinner even, to be letalone; and your eye may as surely disturb his peace, his self-possession, hissense of security, as any gun you may shoot at him or any fire you may kindle inhis fragrant domain.You have but to think a moment in order to understand why even your look may betoo disturbing. When a beast of prey sees a buck that he wants to catch, what ishis invariable mode of procedure? first he hides, then he creeps or skulks orwaits, all the while keeping his eyes fastened upon his victim, watching everymove with fierce intensity till the moment comes to spring. It follows,naturally enough, that when the same beast of prey finds other eyes fixed uponhimself, he knows well what the look means, that a rush will swiftly follow; andhe anticipates the rush by taking to his heels. Or the buck, having once escapedthe charge of a hunting beast, will remember his experience the next time hefinds himself an object of scrutiny, and will flee from it as from any otherdiscomfort.Whether this action is the result of instinctive or deductive knowledge is hereof no consequence: let the psychologists pick a bone over it. Since we have inour heads a strong aversion to being observed too closely, we are probablyfacing an instinct, which is stronger in the brute than in the man; but it isthe fact, not the explanation thereof, which is important. The simple fact is,that wild birds and beasts will not endure watching; and you begin to sympathizewith their notion when you mark the eyes of a stalking cat, with their terriblefire just before she springs. There is always more or less of that fire in awatchful eye; you may see it glow or blaze under a man's narrowed lids before hetakes quick action; and it is the kindling of that dangerous light which asensitive creature expects and avoids when he finds you watching him.Did you ever follow an old cock-partridge in the woods with intent to kill him?If so, you have a living picture of the truth I have explained theoretically.Near our towns the partridge (ruffed grouse) is very wild, taking wing at yourapproach; but in the deep woods he is almost fearless. Even when you stumbleinto a flock of the birds, frightening them out of their calm, they are apt toflit into the trees and remain absolutely motionless. They are then hard tofind, so well do they blend with their background; and if they are young birds,they will hold still after you discover them. Since they were helpless chicksthey have trusted to quietness to conceal them; it serves them very well, muchbetter than running away from stronger enemies; and the habit is strong uponthem, as upon young ducks and other game-birds before they have learned to trusttheir wings. But when you stumble upon an old cock-grouse you meet a bird thathas added experience to instinct, and that knows when to move as well as when tosit still. He dodges out of sight as you raise your rifle; as you follow him hebursts away on whirring wings and slants up into a tree in a distant part of thewood. Marking where he lights, you try to find him, cat-footing around hisperch, peering into every tree-top, putting a \"crik\" in the back of your neck.For a half-hour, it may be, you search for him in vain; suddenly there he is,and—b'r-r-r-r! he is gone. The odd thing is that he sits still so long as youcannot find him; not a feather stirs or a foot shifts or an eyelid blinks evenwhen your glance roves blindly over him; you may give him up and go away,leaving him motionless; but the instant you see him he seems to know it, and inthat instant he is off. This is not a single or an accidental but a typicalexperience; any woodsman who has hunted ruffed grouse with a rifle will smile ashe tells you, \"That's true; but I can't explain it.\"A third bit of woods lore, of which we shall presently make good use, is thatnatural birds and animals have a lively interest in every new or strange thingthey meet. Far from being occupied in a constant struggle for existence, as thebooks misinform us, their lives are full of leisure; they have plentiful hoursfor rest or play or roving, and in these idle times they get most of their funout of life by indulging their curiosity. I fancy that in this respect, also,most people are still natural creatures, seeing that men or women in a crowd areas easily set to stretching their necks as any flock of ducks or band ofcaribou.So strong is the animal's inquisitive instinct (for it surely is an instinct,the basis of all education, and without it we should be fools, learning nothing)that he will readily give over his play or even his feeding to investigate anynew thing which catches his attention. I speak now not of fearsome things, whichmay properly alarm the wood folk, but of pretty or harmless or attractivethings, such as the repeated flash of a looking-glass or the rhythmic swing of ahandkerchief or a whistled tune, which commonly bring wild creatures nearer withforward-set ears and eyes with questions in them. In a word, so far as I haveobserved birds and beasts, their first or natural attitude toward every newobject, unless it be raising fearful smells or moving toward them with hostileintent, is invariably one of curiosity rather than of fear.One proof of this universal trait, to me, is that when I approach wild animalscarelessly they often run away; but of the hundreds that have approached me whenI was quiet in the woods, everyone without exception showed plainly by hisaction that he was keen to find out who or what I might be. Young animals aremore inquisitive than old, having everything to learn, and they are easilyattracted; but age cannot stale the wonder of the world for them, and I havenever chanced to meet an old doe, no, nor a tough old bull moose, that did notcome near to question me if the chance were given. Of the larger wood folkMooween the bear is perhaps the least inquisitive; yet once an old bear came soclose to me, his eyes a question and his nose an exclamation point, that I couldhave touched him before his curiosity was satisfied; and several times, when Ihave been watching the berry-fields, a bear and her cubs have noticed someslight motion of mine and have left their feast of blueberries to approachrather too near for my comfort. At close quarters an old she-bear is a littleuncertain. Commonly she runs away in sudden panic; but should you get betweenher and her cub, and the piggish little fellow squeal out as if frightened orhurt, she may fly into a fury and become dangerous to a man unarmed.The obvious thing to do, in view of what has been learned, is to hold physicallyand mentally still when you meet a wild animal, and so take advantage of hiscuriosity. That is very easy when he happens to find you at rest, for then he isbound to find out something about you before he goes; but even when he catchesyou afoot you may still have a fair chance if you stop in your tracks and moveno muscle while he is looking. Remember that so long as you are motionless youpuzzle him; that you should advance only when his head is turned away, and thatyou should never move directly at any animal, but to one side, as if you wouldgive him plenty of room in passing. If you must change your position or attitudewhile he is looking, move gently and very slowly, avoiding every appearance ofhaste or nervousness. If he vanishes after one keen look, be sure he is aveteran that has seen men before, and bide still where you are. The chances areten to one that no sooner does he think himself hidden than he will turn to haveanother look at you. It is always in your favor, since you have the better eyes,that an animal has the habit of concealment, and so long as you pretend not tosee him he is very apt to think himself unseen.Such a method applies particularly well to all members of the deer family, withtheir insatiable curiosity; but it serves almost as well with beasts of prey,which may be so surprised by meeting a motionless man that they will often\"point\" him in a way to suggest a setter pointing a woodcock. We think of thefox, for example, as the most cunning of animals; like the dolls' dressmaker inOur Mutual Friend, he seems to be saying, \"Oh, I know your tricks and yourmanners\"; yet on a good tracking-snow I have trailed many foxes to theirday-beds, and have found that with few exceptions they act in the samehalf-puzzled, half-inquisitive way. And this is the fashion of it:Looking far ahead on the dainty trail you suddenly catch a glimpse of orangecolor, very warm against the cold whiteness of the snow, which tells you whereEleemos the sly one, as Simmo calls him, is curled on a warm rock or stump withthe winter sunshine fair upon him. Then you must leave the trail, as if you werenot following it, and advance on noiseless feet till the fox raises his head,when you must \"freeze\" in your tracks. If he is a tramp fox (that is, one whichhas come hunting here out of his own territory) or a veteran that has alreadyseen too much of men and their devices, he will dodge out of sight and be seenno more; but if he is an ordinary young fox, especially a cub weathering hisfirst winter, he will almost certainly investigate that odd motionless objectwhich was not there when he went to sleep. After \"pointing\" you a moment heslips into the nearest cover, not turning his head in your direction, butwatching you keenly out of the corners of his yellow eyes. When he thinkshimself hidden from your sight he circles to get your wind; and on this side orthat you will have two or three good glimpses of him before he floats away—orseems to, so lightly does he run—to hunt up another day-bed. Your last view ofhim shows a slyly inquisitive little beast, perfectly self-possessed; but as hedisappears you notice a nervous, quivering, fluttering motion of his greatbrush, which gives him away as a tail betrays a dog, and which says that Eleemosis greatly excited or puzzled over something.Better than roaming noisily through the woods in search of game is to sit stilland let the game come to you—an arrangement which puts you at your ease, and atthe same time encourages the animal to indulge his curiosity without alarm. Youmay not see so many birds or beasts in this way, but some of them you shall seemuch more intimately; and a single inquisitive jay may teach you more of naturethan all the bird books in the world, as I have learned more of Latin humanityfrom Angelo, who polishes my shoes, than from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of theRoman Empire. Very often, if you hold perfectly still, a wild animal will passdown the runway close at hand without even seeing you, and you must draw hisattention by a chirp or a slight motion. Then, when he whirls upon you inastonishment, his eyes saying that he was never so surprised in his life,observe him casually as it were, veiling your interest and never staring at himas if he were a wild or strange beast, but greeting him rather as one you havelong known.At such a moment quietness is the best medicine—quietness and friendly eyes. Ifthe animal wavers, a low song or a whistled tune mayor may not be helpful; itdepends entirely on the tune. You are to keep physically quiet, because anysudden motion will alarm the sensitive creature, so near is he to the unknown;and mentally quiet, because excitement is as contagious as fear or measles, orany other disease of mind or body. When I am alone in the woods wild animals arerarely hard to approach, and when I am sitting quietly by a runway they show nofear of me whatever, drawing near with questioning eyes or moving awayreluctantly; but when I take another with me, especially one who grows excitedin the presence of big game, the same animals appear suspicious, uneasy, and endby bolting away as if we had frightened them.One day there came to my camp a friend who was eager to see a deer at closerange, but who was doubtful of my assurance that animals could neither see norsmell him if he knew how to hold still. When I promised him a deer at ten feethe jumped for his camera, saying that in such an incredible event he would getwhat he had always wanted, a picture of the graceful creature against abackground of his native woods, in soft light and shadow instead of the glaringblack-and-white of a flashlight. At that disturbing proposition all his doubtsmoved into me, who have always found camera folk a fidgety folk. What with theirfussing and focusing and everlasting uneasiness over distance or time orshutter, or something else which is never right and ready, they are sure tobedevil any wild creature before he comes within speaking distance; so I took myfriend and his camera along without faith, hoping for the best.Our stand was a hardwood ridge where deer often passed on their way to the lake,and we had been sitting there hardly an hour when I saw a young spikebuck comingdown the runway. The next moment there was a gasping \"Oh, there's a deer!\" fromthe man who had been warned to keep mentally still. Then began the inevitabletinkering with the camera, which had been thrice prepared and was still asunready as all its kind. More than once I had sat in that precise spot whiledeer passed at a distance of three or four yards without noticing me; but nowthe little buck caught an uneasy motion and halted with head high and eyesflashing. If ever there was a chance for a wonderful picture, he offered it; buthe did not like the focusing, or whatever it was, and after endless delay thecamera clicked on a white flag bobbing among the shadows, where it looked in thenegative like a smear of sunlight.image [images/9781591438984_006.jpg]The camera reminds me of another way of approaching deer, a way often followedby summer campers; namely, by chasing the swimming animal in a canoe. I have butone word to say of such a method, and that is, Don't! When a deer is crossingbroad water you can get as close to him as you will; you can take a grip on himand let him tow your canoe, as thoughtless people sometimes do, encouraged bytheir guides; but I suggest that it would be much better to shoot the creatureand have done with it.A deer's powers are very delicately balanced; he is nervous, high strung, easilyupset. Even on land, where he can distance you in a moment, he begins to worryif he finds you holding steadily to his trail; and I have known a young deer tobecome so flustered after he had been jumped and followed a few times that hebegan to act in most erratic fashion, and was very easily approached. When youchase him in the water, and he finds that he cannot get away from you, he maygive up and drown, as a rabbit submits without a struggle when a weasel rises infront of him; but a vigorous deer is more apt to become highly excited, tostruggle wildly, to waste ten times as much energy as would keep him afloat, tojump his heart action at a dangerous rate; and then a very little more willfinish him as surely as a bullet in the brain.Twice have I seen deer thus killed by thoughtless campers, the last victim beinga splendid buck full grown. Two men saw him swimming an arm of Moosehead Lake,and launched a canoe with no unkinder purpose than to turn him back to shore, sothat a party of sportsmen there might get a picture of him. The buck laboredmightily; but the paddles were swift, and wherever he turned the danger appearedclose in front of him. Suddenly he rose in the water, pawing the air, and heavedover on his side. When the canoe reached him he was dead; and the surprisingthing is that dissection revealed no ruptured blood-vessel nor any other visiblecause of his death. It was probably a matter of heart paralysis. Such an endingwas unusual, I know; but undoubtedly many of these overwrought animals reachshore exhausted, spent to the limit, and lie down in the first good cover, neverto rise again.Moose and caribou are stronger swimmers than deer, and of tougher fiber; but itis still dangerous, I think, to chase them in the water. Once I saw a canoefollowing close behind a cow and a calf moose, the canoeists yelling wildly tohurry up the pace. Had they thought to look once into the eyes of the strugglingbrutes, they might have learned something which they ought to know. As the calflagged farther and farther behind, the mother turned to come between him and thecanoe, and remained there trying to urge and push the little fellow along. Sothey reached shallow water at last, found their footing, and plunged into thecover. The canoe turned away, and no doubt the incident was soon forgotten. Inever saw the canoemen again, but I saw one of the moose. A few days later, inpassing through the woods on that side of the lake, I found the calf stretchedout dead where he had fallen, not fifty yards from the water's edge.Perhaps another \"don't\" should here be memorized for the happy occasion when youfind a fawn or a little cub in the woods, and are moved most kindly to pet him.If the mother is half-tame, or has lived near a clearing long enough to losedistrust of the man-scent, it may do no harm to treat her fawn or cub as youwould a puppy; but to handle any wild little creature is to do him an injury.Until a fawn is strong enough to travel the rough country in which he was born,the doe often leaves him hidden in the woods, where he lies so close and stillthat you may pass without seeing him. Once you discover him, however, and heknows that he is seen, his beautiful eyes begin to question you with a greatwonder. He has no fear of you whatever (this while he is very young, or beforehe begins to follow his mother); he will sometimes follow you when you go away,and he is such a lovable creature, so innocent and so appealing, that it is hardto keep your hands from him. Let him sniff your palm if he will, or lick it withhis rough tongue for the faint taste of salt; but as you value his life don'tpet him or leave the scent of you on his delicate skin. A wild mother knows herown by the sense of smell chiefly; if she finds the startling manscent where sheexpected a familiar odor, she becomes instantly alarmed, and then the little oneis a stranger to her or a source of violent anger.Once, before I learned better than to handle any helpless cub, I saw a doe driveher own fawn roughly away from her, out of my sight and hearing. I had pettedthe fawn a little (a very little, I am glad to remember) and looked with wonderon the mother's anger, not understanding it till some time later, when I learnedof a similar incident with a sadder ending. Not far from my camp a sportsmanwith his guide found a fawn hidden near the stream where they were fishing, andbeing completely won by the beautiful innocent, as most men are, they petted himto their hearts' content. When an old doe, the mother presumably, appearedheading in their direction they thoughtfully withdrew, hiding at a distance towatch the family reunion. The doe seemed to hasten her steps when she saw thatthe fawn was on his feet, instead of lying close where she had left him; butwhen near him she suddenly stiffened, with the hair bristling on her neck. Twoor three times she thrust out her nose, only to back away, and once she raisedthe harsh alarm-cry that a doe utters when she smells danger. Then, as thelittle fellow trotted up to her on his wabbly legs, she leaped upon him in furyand trampled him to death.image [images/9781591438984_011.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_038.jpg]VIIITO return to our first lesson, of quietude: it was impressed upon meunconsciously, like most good lessons, before I had any thought that I waslearning the true way of the woods. The teacher was Nature herself (she seldomfails to quiet boy or man if left alone with him), and the school-room was alonely berry-pasture surrounded by pine and hardwood forests. The berry-pickers,a happy and carefree lot, often let me go with them while I was yet too small tofind my way among the tall swamp-blueberry bushes, and would leave me under atree at the edge of the woods, with an armful of berry-laden branches to keep mebusy while they wandered far away in search of the best picking. Sitting therein the breathing solitude, occupied with the task of filling my tin cup withberries and well content with my lot (for the woods always had a fascination forme, and seemed most friendly when I was alone), I would presently \"feel\" thatsomething was watching me. There was never any suggestion of fear in theimpression, only an awakening to the fact that I was not alone, that some livingthing was near me. Then, as I looked up expectantly, I would almost always finda bird slipping noiselessly through the branches overhead, or a beastie creepingthrough the cover at my side; and in his bright eyes, his shy approach, hiswithdrawal to appear in another spot, I read plainly enough that he was askingwho I was or what I was doing there. And by a whistled tune or a drumming on mycup, or by flashing a sunbeam into his eyes from a pocket glass, I always triedto hold him as long as I could.This curious sense or feeling of being watched, by the way, is very real in somemen, who do not regard it as a matter of chance or imagination. I have known oftwo elaborate courses of \"laboratory\" experiments which aimed to determine howfar such a feeling is trustworthy, and both resulted in a neutral or fifty-fiftyconclusion; but I wonder, if the experiments had been tried on Indians ornatural men under natural conditions, whether the result might not have beenquite different. The fact that the first fifty men you meet get lost or turnedaround in a trackless forest is significant for the fifty, and for the vastmajority of others; but it means nothing to the one bushman who can go where hewill without thought or possibility of being lost, because of his sure sense ofdirection.So, possibly, with this feeling of being watched: it may be too intangible forexperiment, or even for definition. Many times since childhood when I have beenalone in the big woods, fishing or holding vigil by a wilderness lake, I havethe feeling, at times vaguely and again definitely, that strange eyes were uponme. Occasionally, it is true, I have found nothing on looking around, eitherbecause no animal was there or because he was too well hidden to be seen; butmuch more often the feeling proved true to fact—so often, indeed, that I sooncame to trust it without doubt or question, as Simmo my Indian still does, and afew other woodsmen I have known. It is possible that one's ears or nose mayaccount for the feeling; that some faint sound or odor may make itself felt sofaintly that one has the impression of life without knowing through what channelthe impression is received. Of that I am not at all sure; at the moment it seemsthat some extra sense is at work, more subtle than smell or hearing; and,whether rightly or wrongly, it is apparently associated with the penetratingstare of an animal's eyes on your back.To quote but a single incident, out of several that come to my memory: I wasonce sitting on the shore of a lake at twilight, wholly intent on following theantics of a bull moose I had called into the open. He was on the other side of asmall bay, ranging up and down, listening, threshing the bushes with hisantlers, blowing his penny-trumpet at intervals,—in a dozen impatient waysshowing what a young and foolish moose he was. A veteran would have kept to thecover till he had located what he came for. I had ceased my bellowing when thebull first answered, had been thrilled by his rush through the woods, hadcheered him silently when he burst into the open, grunting and challenging likea champion; now I was quietly enjoying his bewilderment at not finding thetantalizing cow he had just heard calling. He did not see or suspect me; I hadthe comedy all to myself, and was keenly interested to know how he would actwhen he rounded the bay, as he certainly would, and found me sitting in hispath. Because he was big and truculent and a fool, I did not know what toexpect; my canoe floated ready against the outer end of a stranded log, where apush would send it and me into deep water. I mention these details simply toshow where my thoughts were.As I watched the play in the hushed twilight, suddenly came the feeling thatsomething was watching me. The bull had started around the bay in my direction;possibly his eyes had picked me out—but no, he was in plain sight, and thefeeling is always associated with something unseen. Without changing position Ilooked carefully all about, searching the lake and especially the woods, whichwere already in deep shadow. Finding no bird or beast, no motion, nothingalarming, I turned to question the bull, who had halted to sound his ridiculoustrumpet. He was perhaps fifty or sixty yards away. He had not yet seen me; I hadno fear of him, no anxiety whatever; yet again came the feeling, this timeinsistent, compelling, as if some one had touched me and said, \"Get away!\" I didso promptly, jumping to my feet; and out of a fir thicket behind me chargedanother bull that I had not dreamed of calling.By his size, his antlers, his fierce grunting, I recognized this brute on theinstant. I had met him before, once on a trail, once on the lake shore, and hadgiven him all the room he wanted. He was a grizzled old bull, morose and ugly,that seemed to have lost his native fear of man—from a galling wound, perhaps,or from living an outcast life by himself. He was a little crazy, I judged. Thathe was dangerous I knew from the fact that he had previously made an unprovokedattack upon my Indian. He, too, had heard the call; had approached it frombehind as stealthily as a cat, and had no doubt watched me, puzzled by mystillness, till my first decided motion brought him out on the jump. But I amwandering away from the small boy getting his first lessons in the woods, andlearning that the important thing is to hold perfectly still.Later, when eight or nine years old, I went alone day after summer day to thewild berry-pastures. When my big pail would hold no more, I would make a bowl bybashing in the top of my hat, and fill it to the brim with luscious blueberries.These with a generous slice of bread made an excellent lunch, which I always atewithin sight of a bird's nest, or the den of a fox, or some other abode of lifethat I had discovered in the woods. And again, as I sat quiet in the solitude,the birds and small animals might be led by curiosity to approach as fearlesslyas when I was too small to harm them. Now a vixen, finding me too near her denand cubs would squall at me impatiently, like a little yellow dog with a cat'svoice; or again, a brooding bird that objected to my scrutiny would first turnher tail to me, and presently come round again, and finally get mad and flutterabout my head, scolding loudly to chivvy me away. So it often happened that onehad nearer or happier or more illuminating glimpses of wild life in that smallhour of rest than would be possible in a month of roaming the woods with gun orcollecting-box.Once as I was eating my lunch under the pines, meanwhile watching a den I hadfound to see what might come out of it, a crow sailed in on noiseless wings andlit so near me that I hardly dared wink for fear he would notice the motion. Myfirst thought was that he was nest-robbing (a crow is very discreet about thatbusiness), but he appeared rather to be listening, cocking his head this way orthat; and from a lazy hawing in the distance I concluded he was satisfyinghimself that his flock was occupied elsewhere and that he was quite alone.Presently he hitched along the branch on which he stood and glided off to thecrotch of a pine-tree, where he began to uncover what was hidden under a mat ofbrown needles. The first thing he took out was a piece of glass, which sparkledwith rainbow colors in a stray glint of sunshine. Then came a bit of quartz withmore sparkles, a shell, a silvery buckle, and some other glistening objectswhich I could not make out. He turned his treasures over and over, all the whilecroaking to himself in a pleased kind of way; then he put them all back, coveredthem again with needles, and slipped away without a sound. Having kept tamecrows, I knew that they are forever stealing and hiding whatever bright objectsthey find about the house; and here in the pine woods was a thing to indicatethat wild crows, perhaps all of them, have the same covetous habit.Another day, a heavenly day when the budding woods were vocal and life stirredjoyously in every thicket, I took a jews'-harp from my pocket and began to twangit idly. No, there was nothing premeditated in the act. I had been rovingwidely, following the winds or the birdcalls till a sunny opening invited me torest, and had then fingered the music-maker with no more purpose than the poet'sboy, who \"whistled as he went for want of thought.\" The rhythmic, nasal twangingwas a sound never heard in that place before or since, I think, and the first tocome hurriedly to investigate was a bright-colored warbler, whose name I did notknow; nor did I care to know it, feeling sure that by some note or sign he wouldpresently suggest a name for himself, which would please me better than thebarbarous jargon I might find in a bird-book. The alert little fellow lit on abranch within three feet of my face, turning his head so as to view me with oneeye or the other when I kept quiet, or chirping his indignation when I twangedthe jews'-harp. Next came a jay, officious as the town constable; then morebirds, half concealing their curiosity under gentle manners; and a squirrel whohad no manners at all, scolding everybody and scurrying about in a fashion whichseemed dangerous to his excited head.As I watched this little assembly, which seemed to be asking, \"What's up? What'sup?\" the meaning of it suddenly dawned on me like a surprising discovery. When Ientered the opening I knew simply that birds or beasts would draw near if theyfound me quiet; before I left it I had found the explanation: that all the woodfolk are intensely curious, as curious as so many human gossips, but without anyof their malice; that by inner compulsion they are drawn to any strange sight orsound, as a crowd collects when a man cuts a caper or throws a fit or raises awhoop or looks up into the air, or does anything else out of the ordinary. Whenyou appear in the quiet woods every bird or beast within sight or hearing isagog to know about you; they are like the Nantucket-Islanders, who named theirone public hack the \"Who's Come?\" Because you are a stranger, and what you do isnone of their business, they are all the more interested in you and your doings;you come to them with all the charm of the unknown, the unexpected; and theywill gratify their curiosity, fearlessly and most pleasantly, so long as youknow how to stimulate or play upon it and to hold still while enjoying it.All that is natural enough, as natural as life; but it is not written in anybook of natural history, and it came to me that day as a wonderful discovery. Itsuggested at once the right way to study birds or beasts, as living creatures;it has since led to many a fascinating glimpse of the wood-folk comedy, and to alifelong pleasure which is too elusive to be set down in words. At the bottom ofit, I suppose, is the fact that in every wild or natural creature is something,at once mysterious and familiar, which appeals powerfully to your interest orsympathy, as if you saw a faint shadow of your other self, or caught a fleetingmemory of that vanished time when you lived in a child's world of wonder anddelight.From the beginning, therefore, I met all birds and animals in a child'simpersonal way; which, strangely enough, ascribes personality to every livingthing, yes, and honors it. These inquisitive little rangers of the wood or theberry-pasture, shy and exquisitely alert, were all individuals like myself, eachone seeking the joy of life in his own happy way. My only regret was that I wastoo clumsy, too obtrusive, too ignorant of the way of the wild, and sofrightened many a timid bird or beast that I would gladly have known.All this, too, is perfectly natural; the instinctive attitude of a child, as ofan animal, is one of curiosity rather than of fear or destruction. If left tohis natural instincts, a child meets every living creature with a mixture ofshyness or timidity and bright interest; he becomes an enemy of the wild,learning to frighten and harry and kill, not from nature but from the evilexample of his elders. I could prove that beyond a peradventure, I think, ifthis were the place; but there is no need of any man's demonstration. Goyourself to the big woods at twilight, leaving custom behind you; go alone andunarmed; hear that rustle of leaves, that tread of soft feet which brings you toan instant halt; see that strange beast which glides out into the trail andturns to look at you with luminous eyes. Then quickly examine your own mentalstate, and you will know the truth of a man's natural or instinctive attitudetoward the mystery of life.Unfortunately the wild birds and beasts near our home have learned that man isunnatural, a creature to be feared, and their curiosity has given place toanother motive. The young still display their natural bent freely; but the oldhave heard too many of our guns, have been too often disturbed by our meddlesomedogs or worthless cats, have suffered too much at the hands of outrageousegg-collectors or skin-collectors to be any longer drawn to us when we goafield. As you go farther away from civilization it becomes easier to play onthe animals' native curiosity; in the far North or the remote jungle, orwherever man is happily unknown, they still come fearlessly to investigate you,or to stand quiet, like the ptarmigan, watching with innocent eyes as you passthem by. In the intermediate regions, which are harried by sportsmen for a briefperiod in the autumn and then left to a long solitude, the animals are wild ortame according to season; and it has seemed to me, not always but on occasions,that in some subtle way they distinguish between man and man, taking alarm atthe first sniff of a hunter, but stopping to show their interest in a harmlesswoods-rover.This last is a mere theory, to be sure, and to some it may appear a fancifulone; but it rests, be assured, upon repeated experience. Thus, I came once atevening to a camp of hunters who were in a sorry plight. They were in a gooddeer country, and had counted largely on venison to supply their table; but formore than a week they had tasted no meat, and they were very hungry. The deerwere wild as hawks, they assured me. They had hunted every day; but because ofthe game's wildness and the dry weather, which made the leaves rustle loudlyunderfoot, it had proved impossible to approach near enough for a shot—all ofwhich made me think that, if you want to see game, you should leave your gun athome. I had met about a dozen deer that day; most of them were within easyrange, and a few of them stood with questioning eyes while a man might have madeready his camera and taken a picture of them.The very next morning, and within a mile of the hunters' camp, I witnessed afamiliar but fascinating display of deer nature. At sunrise I approached a bog,bordering a stream where a few good trout might be found, and on the edge of theopening stood a doe and her well-grown fawn, not twenty yards away. The fawn, alittle buck with the nubs of his first antlers showing, threw up his head as Iappeared, and in the same instant I dropped to the ground behind a mossy log. Nowhistle or sound of alarm followed the action; so I scraped a mat of moss fromthe log, put it on for a bonnet, and cautiously raised my head.The old doe was still feeding; the buck stood like a living statue, his wholeattention fastened on the spot where I had disappeared. He had seen something,he knew not what, and was waiting for it to show itself again. When my bonnetappeared his eyes seemed to enlarge and flash as he caught the motion. Withoutchanging his footing, for his surprise seemed to have rooted him in the ground,he began to sway his body to left or right, stretching his head high or droppingit low, taking a dozen graceful attitudes in order to view the queer bit of mossfrom different angles. Then he slowly raised a fore foot, put it down verygently, raised it again, stamped it down hard. Getting no response to hischallenge, he sidled over to his mother, still keeping his eyes fastened on thelog. At his touch or call she lifted her head, pointing her nose straight at me,as if he had somehow told her where to give heed.It was a wonderful sight, the multicolored bog spread like a rug at the feet ofthe glorious October woods, and standing on the crimson fringe of it these twobeautiful creatures, demanding with flashing eyes who the intruder might be. Fora full minute, while I held motionless, the doe kept her eyes steadily on thelog; then, \"Nothing there, little buck; don't worry,\" she said in her own silentway, and went to feeding once more.\"But there is something; I saw it,\" insisted the little buck, nudging his motherby swinging his head against her side. That was the first and only time, in thatquick swing, when he took his eyes from what attracted them. The doe looked asecond time, saw nothing uncommon, and had turned to feed along the edge of theopening when the little buck recalled her in some way. \"Can't you see it, thatwhite thing like a face under the moss?\" he was saying. \"There! it moved again!\"The mother, whose back was turned to me, twisted her head around as if to humorhim, and to interest her I swayed the moss bonnet to and fro like a pendulum. Atthat she whirled, surprise written large on her, and I dropped my head, leavingher staring. When I looked again both deer were coming nearer, the mother ahead,the fawn holding back as if to say, \"Careful now! It's big, and it's hiding justbehind that log.\" So they drew on warily, stopping to stamp a fore foot, andevery time they challenged I gave the bonnet an answering wag. When they were sonear that I knew they must soon distinguish my eyes from the moss, I sank out ofsight. I was listening for their alarm-call or for the thud of their flying feetwhen a gray muzzle slid over the log, and I laid my hand fair on the mother'scheek before she bounded away.Now there was nothing strange or new in all that; on the contrary, it was verymuch like what I had observed in other inquisitive deer. The only surprisingpart of the comedy was that the doe, though she had felt the touch of my handand no doubt smelled the man behind it, stopped short after a few jumps andturned to stare at the log again. That she was still curious, still unsatisfied,was plain enough; what puzzles me to know is, whether she would have acted inthe same way if one of the hungry hunters had been waiting in my shoes for thechance or moment to kill her.image [images/9781591438984_012.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_039.jpg]IXIT is easy, much easier than you think, to get close to wild birds and beasts;for after you have met them a few times in the friendly, impersonal way I havetried to describe, two interesting traits appear: the first, that they do notsee you clearly so long as you hold still; the second, that even their keennoses lose track of you after you have been quiet for a little time.The eye is a weak point in all animals I have chanced to observe, whichapparently depend less on sight than on any other sense—so far as safety goes,that is. In gratifying their curiosity they seem to be all eyes. At other timesthey will catch an abrupt or unusual motion quickly enough; but they arestrangely blind to any motionless object however large or small. Repeatedly whenI have been sitting quiet, without concealment but with \"neutral\" clothes thatharmonize with the soft woods colors, I have known deer, moose, caribou, bear,wolf, fox, lynx, otter, alert beasts of every kind, to approach within a fewyards, giving no heed till a chirp or a slight motion called their attention.Then they would whirl upon me in astonishment, telling me by their attitude thattill then they had not noticed or suspected me. Almost invariably at such timesanimals of the deer family would come a step nearer, their heads high, theireyes asking questions; but beasts of prey after one keen look would commonlydrop their heads, as if I were of no consequence, and slyly circle me to get mywind. In either event success or a better view of the animal depended on justone condition, which was to hold absolutely still. So long as I met thatcondition, none of these wary beasts seemed to have any clear notion what theywere looking at.Occasionally, indeed, their lack of discernment almost passes belief. One winterday, while crossing a frozen lake in Ontario, I noticed a distant speck movingon the snow, and stopped in my tracks to watch it. The speck turned my way, drewnear and changed into an otter, who came rollicking along in his merry way,taking one or two quick jumps on his abbreviated legs and a long slide on hisample belly. As the air was dry and very still I had no fear of his nose, whichis not as sensitive as many others (perhaps because of the peculiar valve orflap which closes it tight when an otter swims under water); but his eyes andother senses are extraordinarily good, and it seemed impossible that he shouldoverlook a man standing erect on the snowy ice, as conspicuous as a fly in themilk. So I watched the approach with lively interest, wondering how Keeonekhwould act in comparison with other members of his weasel family when he foundhimself near me, whether he would dart away like a fisher, or ignore me like amink, or show his teeth at me like a little stoat.On he came, confidently, as an otter travels, giving no heed to the enemy in hispath, till he halted with a paw resting on one of my snow-shoes and began towiggle his broad muzzle, as if he found something in the air which he did notlike. For several moments he hesitated, sniffing here, listening there, lookingsharply about the lake, into the near-by woods, everywhere except up into myface, and then went on as he had been heading, leaving a straight trail behindhim. No man can tell what was in his head, and a very intelligent head it is;but his action seemed to say that he did not see me when he passed literallyunder my nose. To him I was merely a stump, one of a dozen that projected hereor there above the ice near the shore.Such an incident would be merely freakish if it happened once; but it happensagain and again, becoming almost common or typical, when a man stands motionlessin the presence of other birds or beasts. Twice in the big woods has the Canadalynx, a dull beast in comparison with the otter, passed me with an unseeingstare in his wild eyes. And I have crouched in the snow on a treeless barrenwhile a band of caribou filed past, so near that I could see the muscles rippleunder their sleek skins and hear the click-click of their hoofs as they walked.The greater part of the herd did not even notice me; the rest threw a passingglance in my direction, one halting as if he had a moment's doubt, and went onwithout a sign of recognition.The eyes of birds are keener, as a rule; but it is still a question with me howmuch or how little they see of what is plain as a frog on a log to human vision.An owl has excellent eyes, which are at their best in the soft twilight; yetonce as I sat quiet in the dusk a horned-owl swooped and struck at a motion ofmy head, not seeing the rest of me, one must think, since he is quick to takealarm when a man appears. Another owl showed even less discernment in that heoverlooked me, head and all, at a yard's distance and tried to get his game outfrom under my feet.A little dog had followed me that day, keeping out of sight till we were farfrom home, when he showed himself in a waggish way, as if he knew I would nothave the heart to tie him up in that lonely place, as he deserved. All day longhe had a vociferous and a \"bully\" time making a nuisance of himself, stirring upa hornets' nest in every peaceful spot, chasing deer out of sight with a blitherowdydow, swimming out to the raft on which I was fly-fishing, jumping in to gettangled in my landing-net when I reached for a big trout—in twenty ways showingthat his business was to take care of me, though he was no dog of mine.Late in the afternoon, as I rested beside the homeward trail, the little dogrambled off by himself, still looking for trouble, like all his breed. Presentlythere was a yelp, a scurry, a glimpse of broad wings swooping, and back came thetroubleseeker like a streak, his eyes saying, \"Look at this thing I broughtyou!\" and his ears flapping like a pair of wings to help him along. Over himhovered a big barred-owl, grim as fate, striking, missing, mounting, swoopingagain, brushing me with his wings as he whirled around my head. Between my heelsand the log on which I was sitting my protector wedged himself securely; the owlwith a vicious snapping of his beak sailed up into an evergreen and made himselfinvisible. In a moment or two the little dog came out and was wagging his tailmightily over the adventure when the owl slanted down on noiseless wings andstruck a double set of claws into him. Then I interfered, rising to my feet; andthen, for the first time I think, the owl saw me as something other than a stumpand vanished quickly in the spruce woods.Hawks likewise have marvelous eyes for all things that move; but I began toquestion the quality of their vision one day when I was watching a deer, and ared-shouldered hawk lit so near me that I reached out a hand and caught him.Another afternoon I came upon a goshawk, keenest of all the falcons, that hadjust killed a grouse in the tote-road I was following. He darted away as I cameround a bend; but thinking he might soon return, for he is a bold and apersistent kind of pirate, I entered the woods at a swift walk, as if goingaway. Then I worked cautiously back to the road through a thicket, and waited ona log in deep shadow, some fifty yards above where the grouse lay undisturbed.Luckily I had a rifle, an accurate little twenty-two, often carried as medicinefor \"vermin,\" and I intended to kill the goshawk at the first chance. He is theviking among birds, and as such has a romantic interest; but wherever he appearshe is a veritable pest, the most destructive of the hungry hordes that come downfrom the North to play havoc with our game.For a long time the goshawk hovered about, sweeping on tireless wings high abovethe trees; but though I was quiet enough to deceive any bird or beast, he heldwarily aloof. Once he disappeared, remaining so long away that I was beginningto think he had wearied of the game of patience, when I heard an eery call andsaw him wheeling over the road again. His absence became clear a little laterwhen he perched on a blasted pine, far out of range, where he remained watchingfor fifteen or twenty minutes, his only motion being an occasional turning ofthe head. That he was hungry and bound to have his own was plain enough; thepuzzle was why he did not come and get it, for it seemed highly improbable thathe would notice a motionless figure at that distance. I think now that he wassailing high over my head when I re-entered the trail; that he knew where I wasall the time, not because he saw me on the log, but because he did not see me goaway. Before sunset he headed off toward the mountain, going early to roost withall his kind.Dawn found me back on the old road, as much to test the matter of vision as toput an end to the game-destroyer. As a precaution I had changed clothes, and nowshifted position, avoiding the log because the wary bird would surely take alook at it before coming down. My stand was a weathered stump beside the road,against which I sat on a carpet of moss, without concealment of any kind. At ashort distance lay the grouse, a poor crumpled thing, just as he had wiltedunder the hawk's swoop.Thus a half-hour or more passed comfortably. A gorgeous cock-partridge saunteredinto the open, saw me when I nodded to him, and went slowly off with thatgraceful, balancing motion which a grouse affects when he is well satisfied withhimself. Then, as the sun rose, there was a swift-moving shadow, a rustle ofpinions; the goshawk swept down the road in front of me and lit beside his game.He was a handsome bandit, in full adult plumage; his gray breast was penciled inshadowy lines, while his back was a foggy blue, as if in his northern home hehad caught the sheen of the heavens above and of rippling waters beneath hisflight. His folded wings stood out squarely from his shoulders with animpression of power, like an eagle's. There was something noble in his poise, inhis challenging eye, in the forward thrust of his fierce head; but the spell wasbroken at the first step. He moved awkwardly, unwillingly it seemed; his greatcurving talons interfered with his footing when he touched the earth.This time, instead of a rifle, there was a trim shotgun across my knees. Thehawk was mine whether he stood quiet or leaped into swift flight, and feelingsure of him now I watched awhile, wondering whether he would break up his gamewith his claws, as some owls do, or tear it to pieces with his hooked beak. Fora moment he did neither, but stood splendidly alert over his kill. Once heturned his head completely around over either shoulder, sweeping his piercingglance over me, but seeing nothing unusual. Then he seized his game in one footand struck his beak into the breast, making the feathers fly as he laid thedelicate flesh open. When I found myself weakening, growing sentimental at thethought that it was his last meal, his last taste of freedom and the wild, Iremembered the grouse and got quietly on my feet. Though busy with his feast, hecaught the first shadow of a motion; I can still see the gleam in his wild eyesas he sprang aloft.I thought him beyond all harm as he lay on his back, one outstretched wing amongthe feathers of his victim; but he struck like a flash when I reached down forhim carelessly. \"Take that! and that! and remember me!\" he said, driving hisweapons up with astonishing force, a force that kills or paralyzes his game atthe first grip. Four of his needle-pointed talons went to the bone, and theothers were well buried in the flesh of my arm. The old viking had been sometime with his ancestors before I pried him loose.As for the sense of smell, on which most animals depend for accurateinformation, I have tried numerous experiments with deer, moose, bear and othercreatures to learn how far they can wind a man, and how their powers compare onewith another. There is no definite answer to the problem, so baffling are theconditions of observing these shy beasts; but you are in for some surprises, atleast, when you attempt to solve it in the open. You will learn, for example,that when a gale is blowing the animals are more at sea than in a dead calm; orthat in a gusty wind you can approach them about as easily from one side as fromanother. Such a wind rolls and eddies violently, rebounding from every hill orpoint or shore in such erratic fashion that the animals have no means oflocating a danger when they catch a fleeting sniff of it. It is for this reason,undoubtedly, that all game is uncommonly wild on a windy day: the constantmotion of leaves or tossing boughs breeds confusion in their eyes, and thewoodsy smells are so broken by cross-currents that they cannot be traced totheir source. So it has happened more than once on a gusty day that a deer,catching my scent on the rebound, has whirled and rushed straight at me,producing the momentary illusion that he was charging.With a steady but not strong wind blowing in their direction, I have seen deerbecome alarmed while I was yet a quarter-mile away; this on a lake, where therewas nothing to interfere with the breeze or the scent. On the burnt lands or theopen barrens I have seen bear and caribou throw up their heads and break awaywhile I was even farther removed. In a light breeze the distance is muchshorter, varying from fifty to two hundred yards, according to the amount ofmoisture in the air. On days that are still or very dry, or when the air isfilled with smoke from a forest fire (the latter soon inflames all sensitivenostrils), the animals are at sea again, and depend less on their noses than ontheir eyes or ears.Another surprising thing is, that the animal's ability to detect you through hissense of smell is largely governed by your own activity or bodily condition.Thus, when a man is perspiring freely or moving quickly, his scent is strongerand travels much wider than when he is sauntering about. But if a man sitsabsolutely quiet, a clean man especially, no animal can detect him beyond a fewfeet, I think, for the reason that a resting man is like a resting bird or beastin that he gives off very little body scent, which remains on the ground closeabout him instead of floating off on the air currents. Even when the trees aretossing in a gale there is little stir on the ground, not in the woods at least,and the closer you hold to Mother Earth the less likelihood is there of anybeast smelling you.All ground-nesting birds depend for their lives on this curious provision ofnature. Were it not for the fact that practically no scent escapes while theyare brooding their eggs, very few of them would live to bring forth a family ina wood nightly traversed by such keen-nosed enemies as the fox and the weasel.My old setter would wind a running grouse or quail at an incredible distance,and would follow him by picking his scent from the air; but I have taken thatsame dog on a leash near the same birds when they were brooding their eggs, andhe could not or would not detect them unless he were brought within a few feet,or (a rare occurrence) unless a creeping ground-breeze blew directly from thenest into his face.The same provision guards animals, such as deer and caribou, which build no densbut leave their helpless young on the ground. Two or three times, after findinga fawn in the woods, I have tested his concealment by means of my young dog'snose; and I may add that Rab will point a deer as stanchly as he points a grouseor woodcock, for he is still in the happy, irresponsible stage when everythingthat lives in the woods is game to him. So long as the fawn remains motionlesswhere his mother hid him, the dog must be almost on top of him before pointingor showing any sign of game. But if the little fellow runs or even rises to hisfeet at our approach (fawns are apt to do this as they grow older), the dogseems to catch the scent after the first motion; he begins to cat-foot, his noseup as in following an air trail, and steadies to a point while he is still manyyards away from where the fawn was hiding.The nose of a wolf is keener than that of any dog I ever knew; yet I oncetrailed a pack of wolves that passed within sixteen measured feet of where twodeer were sleeping in a hole in the snow. The wolves were hunting, too, for theykilled and partially ate a buck a little farther on; but the trail said thatthey had passed close to these sleeping deer without detecting them.As for the man-scent, you may judge of that by the violent start or the headlongrush when an animal catches the first alarming whiff of it. If he passes quietlyon his way, therefore, you may be reasonably sure he has not smelled you. To thelatter conclusion I have been forced many times when I have been watching in thewoods, sitting quiet for hours at a stretch, and a deer or bear or fox, or someother beast with nose as keen as a brier, has passed at a dozen yards' distancewithout a sign to indicate that he was aware of me. Some of these animals camemuch nearer; so near, in fact, that I was scary of a closer approach until I hadcalled their attention to what lay ahead of them.So long as you are seen or suspected, you need have little fear of any wildbeast (only the tame or half-tame are dangerous), but a brute that stumbles uponyou in an unexpected place or moment is always a problem. Nine times out of tenhe will fall all over himself in his haste to get away; but the tenth time hemay fall upon you and give you a mauling. Moose, for example, are apt to strikea terrible blow with their fore feet, or to upset a canoe when the jack-lightapproaches them; not to attack, I think, at least not consciously, but in blindpanic or to ward off a fancied enemy. So when I have watched from the shore of alake and a moose came swinging along without noticing me, I have risen to myfeet or thrown my hat at the big brute when he was as near as I cared to havehim. And more than once, after a tremendous start of surprise, he has comenearer with his hackles up as soon as he got over the first effect of mydemonstration. Yet when I am roaming the woods that same brute will catch myscent at from two to five hundred yards, and rush away before I can get even aglimpse of him.That the same surprising sense-limitation is upon deer and other game animalsmay be inferred from the following experience, which is typical of many others.I was perched among some cedar roots on the shore of a pond, one September day,watching a buck with the largest antlers I have ever seen on one of his kind. Ihad been some time quiet when he glided out to feed in a little bay, on myright; and my heart was with him in the wish that he might keep his noble crownthrough the hunting season, for his own pleasure and the adornment of the woodsand the confusion of all headhunters. There was no breeze; but a moistenedfinger told of a faint drift of air from the lake to the woods.As I watched the buck, there came to my ears a crunching of gravel from theopposite direction, and two deer appeared on the point at my left, headingbriskly down into the bay. They passed between my outstretched feet and thewater's edge, where the strip of shore was perhaps three yards wide; then theyturned in my direction, seeing or smelling nothing, went slowly up the bank andhalted at the edge of the woods to the right and a little behind me, so closethat I dared not move even my eyes to follow them. I measured the distanceafterward, and found that from their hoof-marks to the cedar root against whichI rested was less than eight feet. Imperceptibly I turned for another look, andsaw both deer at attention, their heads luckily pointed away from me. They wereregarding the big buck intently, as if to question him. They showed no alarm asyet; but they were plainly uneasy, searching the forest on all sides and attimes turning to look over my head upon the breathless lake. Every nervousaction said that they found something wrong in the air, some hint or taint orwarning which they could not define. So they moved alertly into the woods,halting, listening, testing the air, using all their senses to locate a dangerwhich they had passed and left behind them.From such experiences one might reasonably conclude that, like the broodinggrouse or the hidden fawn, a motionless man gives off so little scent that thekeenest nose is at fault until it comes almost within touching distance. If anyfurther proof is needed, you may find it when you sleep in the open, and shycreatures draw near without any fear of you. By daylight deer, bear and mooseare extremely timid; they rarely come within eyeshot of your camp, and theyvanish at the first sniff which tells them that you have invaded theirfeeding-grounds. But when you are well asleep the same animals will pass boldlythrough your camp-yard; or they will awaken you, as they have many timesawakened me, when you are tenting or sleeping under the stars by some outlyingpond. If you lie quiet, content to listen, the invading animal will move freelyhere or there without concern; but no sooner do you begin to stir, howeverquietly, than he catches the warning scent, and a thudding of earth or asmashing of brush tells the rest of the story.I recall one night, cloudy and very still, when I slept under my canoe on astrip of sand beside a wilderness lake. The movement of an animal near at handawoke me. In the black darkness I could see nothing; but somehow I knew he wasbig, and aside from the crepitation of the sand, which I plainly heard, I seemedto feel the brute near me. For a moment there was a pause, a dead silence; thencame a thump, a rattlety-bang; the canoe shook as something hit the lower end ofit, and the creature moved away. There was nothing to be done without eyes, so Isnuggled the blanket closer and went to sleep again. In the morning there werethe tracks of a moose, a bull as I judged from the shape of his feet, to saythat he had come down the shore at a fast walk, halted, stepped over the sternof the canoe, and went on without hastening his pace.That was odd enough; but more surprising were some tracks on the other side,between the bow of the canoe and the woods. Very faint and dainty tracks theywere, as if a soft pad had touched the sand here and there in an uneven line;but they told of a fox who had come trotting along under the bank, and who hadpassed in the night without awakening me. That neither he nor the moose hadsmelled the sleeping man, or nothing alarming in him at least, is about as nearto certainty as you will come in interpreting animal action.image [images/9781591438984_006.jpg]There is another and not wholly unreasonable hypothesis which may help toexplain such phenomena; namely, that it is not the scent of man but ofexcitement, anger, blood-lust or some other abnormal quality which alarms a wildanimal. It sounds queer, I know, to say that anger can be smelled; but it ismore than probable that anger or fierce excitement of any kind distils in thebody a kind of poison which is physical and sensible. Such excitement certainlyweakens a man, clogging his system with the ashes of its hot fires; and there isno reason why it should not smell to earth as well as to high heaven.You have but to open your eyes and expand your nostrils for some evidence ofthis matter. Bees when angered give off a pungent odor, which is so differentfrom the ordinary smell of the hive that even your dull nose may detect thechange of temper. The same is true of even cold-blooded reptiles. When you finda rattler or a blacksnake squirming in the sun, you can smell him faintly at afew yards' distance. Now stir him up with a pole, or pin him to the earth bypressing a forked stick with short prongs over his neck. As the snake becomesenraged he pours off a rank odor, very different from the musky smell that firstattracted your notice, and it travels much wider, and clings to your clothes foran hour afterward. It is not only possible but very likely, therefore, thatstrong emotions affect the bodies of all creatures in a way perceptible tosenses other than sight. If so, one man who is peaceable and another who isangry or highly excited may give off such different odors that a brute withsensitive nostrils may be merely curious about the one and properly afraid ofthe other.That wild animals instinctively fear the scent of humanity, as such, is probablynot true. The notion arises, I think, from judging the natural animal by thosewe have made unnatural by abuse or persecution. Whenever man penetrates a wildregion for the first time he finds, as a rule, that the animals have little fearof him, the tameness of wild game having been noted with surprise by almostevery explorer. It has been noted also, but without surprise, by saints andascetics who \"for the greater glory of God\" have adopted a life of solitude andmeditation, and who have often found the birds or beasts about their hermitageto be quite fearless of them, and receptive of their kindness. Not till theabundant flocks and herds of a new region have been harried and decimated bysenseless slaughter do the survivors begin to be fearful and unapproachable, aswe unfortunately know them. Yet even now, no sooner do we drop our persecutionand assume a rational or humane attitude than the wild ducks come to the boatlanding of a winter hotel, deer feed at our haystacks, and bears come in broaddaylight to comfort themselves at our garbage-cans. Such things could hardly beif the fear of man were an age-old or instinctive inheritance.Nearer home, on any farm bordering the wilderness, you may see wild deer feedingquite tamely about the edges of the cleared fields all summer. I recall one suchfarm in Maine, where the owner had fifteen acres of green oats waving overvirgin soil—a glorious crop for me, but for him an occasion of lamentation. Youcould go through that field at any hour before six in the morning or after sixat night and find a dozen deer with a moose or two making themselves at home.The owner's cattle were kept out by a rail fence; but the moose simply leanedagainst the fence and went through, while the nimble deer sailed over theobstruction like grasshoppers. On all such farms the deer have the scent of manalmost constantly in their nostrils, and they are simply watchful, running whenyou approach too near, but turning after a short flight to have a look at you.At times you may see them feeding when the scent of laborers or fishermen blowsfairly over them. But when October comes, and the law is \"off,\" and wild-eyedhunters appear with guns in their hands and death in their thoughts, then thesame deer quickly become as other and wilder creatures, rushing off in alarm atthe first sniff of an enemy. The fact and the changed action are evident enough;the only interesting question is, To what extent does the smell of man changewhen he changes his peaceable ways?Two or three times I have had opportunity to test the effect of the human scentin another way, the first time being when I had the good luck to see a naturalchild and a natural animal together. The child, a baby girl just beginning totoddle, was making a journey by means of a comfortable Indian paukee on my back,and I had left her in an opening beside a portage trail while I went back to mycanoe for a thing I had forgotten. While I was gone, three deer sauntered intothe opening. They saw the baby, and were instantly as curious about her as somany gossips, a little spotted fawn especially. The baby saw them, and begancreeping eagerly forward, calling or \"crowing\" as she went. The deer saw andheard and smelled her every moment; yet they walked around her with springysteps, now on this side, now on that, showing a world of curiosity in theirbright eyes, but never a sign of fear.From a distance I watched the lovely scene, kindling at the beauty of it, orfeeling a bit anxious when I saw the sharp feet of the old doe a little too nearthe sunny head or the outstretched hands. Then an eddy of wind from the mountaingot behind me and whirled over the deer. They caught the scent and were awaywith a wild alarm-call, their white flags flying, and the baby waving by-by asthey vanished in the woods.Quite naturally, therefore, when a sensitive animal runs away from me, I findmyself thinking that perhaps it is not the smell of humanity but of some eviltrait or quality which frightens him. I first laid down this hypothesis aftermeeting a strange, childlike man, who had a passion for roaming by himself inthe fields or woods. White men, after a puzzling acquaintance, would tap theirheads or call him crazy; an Indian would look once in his eyes and say, verysoftly, \"The Great Spirit has touched him.\" He was all gentleness, without athought or possibility of harm in his nature. He was also without fear, andperhaps for this reason he inspired no fear in others. When he appeared in thewoods, singing to himself, the animals would watch him for a moment, and then gotheir ways quietly, as if they understood him. What would happen if a race ofsuch men lived near the wood folk must be left to the imagination.image [images/9781591438984_014.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"> image [images/9781591438984_040.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_041.jpg]XTO reach my pond you must leave your canoe on the shore of Sungeegamook, thehome lake, and go eastward through the big woods. Yonder is the landing, thatbank of green topped by \"everlasting\" and blue asters, with a cleft like anarched doorway in the forest behind it. A rugged jack-pine leans out over a bitof shingle, as if to indicate a good place to beach your canoe, and there issomething curiously alive, almost sentient, in its attitude. The old tree seemsto watch your approach; through its leaves runs a low murmur of welcome as youstep ashore.Entering the woods (and because you are alone, and therefore natural, somethingin their dim aisles, their mysterious depths, their breathing silence, makes yougo gently) you find yourself in an old logging-road, once a garish symbol ofman's destructiveness, but growing yearly more subdued, more beautiful, sinceNature began her work of healing. The earth beneath your feet, the restful earthwhich the lumbermen left torn by iron tools or rent by dynamite, has again puton her soft-colored garments. Feathery beds of fern push boldly into the roadfrom shadowy places; wild grasses fill all its sunny openings with their bloomand fragrance; and winding down through shade or sunshine comes a trail made bythe feet of deer and moose. Already these timid animals have adopted theforgotten road as a runway; you may meet them here when you return in theevening twilight.Everywhere beside the trail are old marks of the destroyer. Noble maples orcedars that were centuries growing have been slashed down, dismembered, thrustaside to decay, and all because they stood in the way of a lumber-boss whothought only of getting his cut of spruce down to the lake. To look upon suchtrees, dead and shorn of their beauty, is to feel pity or indignation; butNature does not share your feeling, being too abundant of life and resource towaste any moment in regret. Already she is upbuilding what man has torn down.Glaring ax-wounds have all disappeared under bandages of living moss; everyfallen log has hidden its loss under a mantle of lichen, soft and gray, whichspeaks not of death but of life renewed.Where the sun touches these prostrate giants a blush of delicate color spreadsover them. See, it deepens as you look upon it curiously, and you examine it tofind a multitude of \"fairy-cups\" on slender stems, each lifting its scarletchalice to the light. Very soft and inviting seats they offer, yielding to yourweight, sending up an odor as of crushed herbs; but do not accept theinvitation. If you must halt to rest or to enjoy the stillness, sit not down onone of these mossy logs, but before it at a little distance, and let its blendedcolors be to your eye what the wind in the pine is to your ear, or the smell ofhemlock to your nostrils. Then will all your senses delight in harmony, theirnatural birthright, while you rest by the way.Where the old road winds about the end of a ridge, avoiding every steep pitch,young balsams are crowding thickly into it; where it turns downward to thelowlands, quick-growing alders claim it as their own; and as you leave the lakefar behind it begins to divide interminably, each branch breaking into smallerbranches, like the twigs of a tree as you trace them outward. The twig ends witha bud in clear space; but the farther or landward end of a logging-road dwindlesto a deer-path, the path to a rabbit-run, and the run vanishes in some gloomycedar swamp or trackless thicket where is no outlook on any side.It is in such places, while you puzzle over another man's road instead ofkeeping your own trail straight, that you are most apt to get lost. Coming backyou need have no fear of going astray, since all these trails lead to the mainroad, and thence downhill to the lake; but going forward it is well to steerclear of all branch roads, which lead nowhere and confuse the sense ofdirection.Leaving the road behind, therefore, and heading still eastward, you cross aridge where the hardwoods stand, as their ancestors stood, untouched by thetools of men. Immense trunks of beech or sugar-maple or yellow birch towerupward wide apart, the moss of centuries upon them; far overhead is a delicatetracery of leaves, a dance of light against the blue, and over all is theblessed silence.Beyond the ridge the ground slopes downward to a uniform level. Soon the mossgrows deeper underfoot, with a coolness that speaks of perpetual moisture. Theforest becomes dense, almost bewildering; here a \"black growth\" of spruce orfir, there a tangle of moosewood, yonder a swale where impenetrablealder-thickets make it impossible to hold a straight course. Because all thisgrowth is useless to the lumberman, there is no cutting to be seen; but becauseI have passed this way before, instinctively following the same course like ananimal, a faint winding trail begins to appear, with a bent twig or a blazedtree at every turn to give direction.As you move forward more confidently, learning the woodsman's way of looking farahead to pick up the guiding signs before you come to them, the dim forestsuddenly brightens; a wave of light runs in, saying as it passes overhead thatyou are near an opening. As if to confirm the message, the trail runs into awell-worn deer-path, which looks as if the animals that used it knew well wherethey were going. Clumps of delicate young larches spring up ahead; between themopen filmy vistas, like windows draped in lace, and across one vista stretches aribbon of silver. A few more steps and—there! my little pond is smiling at you,reflecting the blue deeps of heaven or the white of passing clouds from itssetting of pale-green larch-trees and crimson mosses.And now, if you are responsive, you shall have a new impression of this oldworld, the wonderful impression which a wilderness lake gives at the moment ofdiscovery, but never again afterward. As you emerge from cover of the woods, thepond seems to awaken like a sleeper. See, it returns your gaze, and on its quietface is a look of surprise that you are here. Enjoy that first awakening look;for there is more of wisdom and pleasure in it, believe me, than in hurryingforth blindly intent on making a map or catching a trout, or doing somethingelse that calls for sight to the neglect of insight. All sciences, includingchartography and angling, can easily be learned by any man; but understanding isa gift of God, and it comes only to those who keep their hearts open.Your own nature is here your best guide, and it shows you a surprising thing:that your old habitual impressions of the world have suddenly become novel andstrange, as if this smiling landscape were but just created, and you were thefirst to look with seeing eyes upon the glory of it. It tells you, further, ifyou listen to its voice, that creation is all like this, under necessity to bebeautiful, and that the beauty is still as delightful as when the evening andthe morning were the first day. This dance of water, this rain of light, thisshimmer of air, this upspringing of trees, this blue heaven bending over all—noartist ever painted such things; no poet ever sang or could sing them. Like amother's infinite tenderness, they await your appreciation, your silence, yourlove; but they hide from your description in words or pigments.finally, in the lowest of whispers, your nature tells you that the mostimpressive and still most natural thing in this quiet scene is the consciouslife that broods silently over it. As the little pond seems to awaken, to bealive and sentient, so also does that noble tree yonder when you view it for thefirst time, or that delicate orchid wafting its fragrance over the lonely bog.Each reflects something greater than itself, and it is that greater \"something\"which appeals to you when you enter the solitude. Your impressions here arethose of the first man, a man who found many beautiful things in a garden, andGod walking among them in the cool of the day. Call the brooding life God or theInfinite or the Unknown or the Great Spirit or the Great Mystery—what you will;the simple fact is that you have an impression of a living Being, who firstspeaks to you in terms of personality that you understand.So much, and more, of eternal understanding you may have if you but tarry amoment under these larches with an open mind. Then, when you have honored yourfirst impression, which will abide with you always, you may trace out thephysical features of my pond at leisure. Just here it is not very wide; your eyeeasily overlooks it to rest with pleasure on a great mound of moss, colored asno garden of flowers was ever colored, swelling above the bog on the farthershore. On either hand the water sparkles wider away, disappearing around a bendwith an invitation to come and see. To the left it ends in velvety shadow undera bank of evergreen; to the right it seems to merge into the level shore, whereshadow melts with substance in a belt of blended colors. A few yards back fromthe shore groups of young larches lift their misty-green foliage above thecaribou moss; they seem not to be rooted deep in the earth, but to be allstanding on tiptoe, as if to look over the brim of my pond and see their ownreflections. Everywhere between these larch groups are shadowy corridors; and inone of them your eye is caught by as pot of bright orange. The spot moves,disappears, flashes out again from the misty green, and a deer steps forth tocomplete the wilderness picture with the grace of life.Such is my pond, hidden away in the heart of a caribou bog, which is itself wellhidden in dense forest. Before I found it the wild ducks had made it a summerhome from time immemorial; and now, since I disturb it no more, it is possessedin peace by a family of beavers; yet I still think of it as mine, not by graceof any artificial law or deed, but by the more ancient right of possession andenjoyment. A hundred lakes by which I have tented are greater or more splendid;but the first charm of any wilderness scene is its solitude, and on thesegreater lakes the impression of solitude may be broken by the flash of apaddle-blade in the sun, or the chuck of an ax under the twilight, or the gleamof a camp-fire through the darkness. But here on my pond you may know how Adamfelt when he looked abroad: no raft has ever ruffled its surface; no ax-strokeor moan of smitten tree has ever disturbed its quiet; no camp-fire has evergleamed on its waters. Its solitude is still that of the first day; and it hasno name, save for the Indian word that came unbidden at the moment of findingit, like another Sleeping Beauty, in the woods.Do you ask how I came to find my pond? Not by searching, but rather by the oddchance of being myself lost. I had gone astray one afternoon, and was pushingthrough some black growth when an alarm rose near at hand. A deer whistledloudly, crying \"Heu! heu! heu!\" as he jumped away, and on the heels of his crycame a quacking of flushed ducks.Till that moment I thought I knew where I was; but the quacking brought doubt,and then bewilderment. If a duck tells you anything in the woods, he tells youof water, plenty of it; but the map showed no body of water nearer than Big PinePond, which I had fished that day, and which should be three or four milesbehind me. Turning in the direction of the alarm, I soon broke out of the coverupon a caribou bog, a mysterious expanse never before suspected in that region,and before me was the gleam of water in the sunshine. \"A pond, a new one, andwhat a beauty!\" I thought with elation, as I caught its awakening look andfeasted my eyes on its glory of color. Then I gave it an Indian name and hurriedaway; for I was surely off my course, and the hour was late for lingering instrange woods. Somewhere to the west of me was the home lake; so westward Iheaded, making a return-compass of bent twigs, till I set my feet in a branch ofthe old logging-road. And that chance trail is the one I have ever sincefollowed.image [images/9781591438984_015.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_042.jpg]XINEXT morning I returned to explore my find at leisure. One part of thatexploration was to go completely around the bog, to learn its guiding landmarksand compass-bearings; but an earlier and better part was to sit quietly besidemy pond to hear whatever it might have to say to me. If that last soundsfanciful, remember that many things are voiceless in this world, but few arewholly dumb. Of the numberless ponds that brighten the northern wilderness, somewere made by beavers, others by flood or glacier or earthquake, and no two ofthem tell the same story or make the same impression. They are like so manyunspoiled Indians, whom we regard from a distance as being mysteriously alike,but who have different traditions, ideals, personalities, and even differentlanguages.I know not what the spell of any lonely place may be when you make yourself partof it; I only know that it stirs one strangely, like the flute note of awood-thrush or a song without words. Though I never met with an adventure on mylittle pond, never cast a fly to learn whether any trout lurked in its waters,never thought of firing a shot at its abundant game, yet season after season Ireturned to it expectantly, and went away satisfied. Such a pond has a charm ofits own, a spell which our forebears sought to express in terms of nymphs orpuckwudgies or water-sprites. It grows a better crop than trout, attracts afiner game than deer or water-fowl, and you can seldom visit it without learningsomething new about your natural self or the wood folk or the friendly universe.Thus, it happens on a day when you are waiting beside your pond, or wending yourway to it, that a moose or a fox or a dainty grouse appears unexpectedly nearyou; and instantly, without thought or motive, you \"freeze\" in your tracks or,if you are not seen, shrink deeper into the shadow for concealment. The actionis natural, involuntary, instinctive, precisely like the action of a young deerunder similar circumstances; but when it is over you understand it, and smile atfinding yourself becoming more and more like other natural creatures,—goingsoftly, that is, making yourself inconspicuous without trying or knowing how,and having no thought of harm to any bird or beast, but only of watching him orgauging his course while remaining yourself unseen. Only by some such method canyou learn anything worth knowing about a wild animal: books describe,naturalists classify and sportsmen kill him; but to understand him you must be asharer of his quiet ways.Comes another day, a day when you are in love with solitude itself, when youlearn with surprise that a man is never lonely when alone in the woods; thatideals may be quite as companionable as folks; and that around you in a goodlycompany are beauty, peace, spacious freedom and harmonious thoughts, with a hintalso, to some minds, of angels and ministers of grace. The Attendant Spirit of\"Comus,\" the Ariel of\" The Tempest,\" the good fairies of all folk,—these arenever understood in the town, nor in the woods unless you enter them alone.At a later time, and with a thrill of great wonder, you may discover the meaningof silence, and of the ancient myth of a lovely goddess of silence; not the deadsilence of a dungeon, which may roar in a man's ears till it deafens him ordrives him mad, but the exquisite living silence of nature, a silence which atany moment may break into an elfin ringing of bells, or into a faintly echoingsound of melody, as if stars or unseen beings were singing far away.This impression of melody is often real, not illusory, and may be explained bythe impact of air-currents on resonant shells of wood, hundreds of which fall tohumming with the voice of 'cellos and wind-harps; but there is anotherexperience of the solitude, more subtle but none the less real, for which onlythe psychologist will venture to give an accounting. Once in a season, perhaps,comes an hour when, no matter what your plans or desires may be, your mind seemsintent on some unrelated affair of its own. As you hurry over the trail, you maybe thinking of catching a trout or stalking a buck or building a camp or gettingto windward of a corporation; meanwhile your subconscious mind, disdaining yourwill or your worry, is busily making pictures of whatever attractive thing itsees,—radiant little pictures, sunshiny or wind-swept, which shall be reproducedfor your pleasure long after the important matters which then occupied you areclean forgotten.Here is the story of one such picture, a reflection, no doubt, of the primitivetrait or quality called place-memory, which enables certain animals or savagesto recognize any spot on which their eyes have once rested.One late afternoon, years after I had found my pond, I crossed the mountain fromdistant Ragged Lake, heading for the home lake by a new route. There was notrail; but near the foot of the western slope of the hills I picked up an oldlumber road which seemed to lead in the right direction. For a time all wentwell, and confidently; but when the road dipped into an immense hollow, andthere showed signs of petering out, I followed it with increasing doubt, notknowing where I might come out of the woods or be forced to spend the night. AsI circled through a swale, having left the road to avoid a press of alders thatfilled it, an ash-tree lifted its glossy head above a thicket with a cheery\"Well met again, pilgrim! Whither away now?\"It was a surprising hail in that wild place, suggestive of dreams orsleep-walking; but under the illusion was a grain of reality which brought me toan instant halt. After passing under thousands of silent trees all day, suddenlyhere was one speaking to me. And not only that, but wearing a familiar look,like a face which smiles its recognition of you while you try in vain to placeit. Where, when had I seen that tree before? No, impossible! I had never beforeentered this part of the vast forest. Yet I must have seen it some-where,—or itcould not now stir a familiar memory. Nonsense! just a trick of the imagination.I must hurry on. Thus my thoughts ran, like a circling hare; and all the whilethe ash-tree seemed to be smiling at my perplexity.The man who ignores such a hint has much to learn about woodcraft, which islargely a subconscious art; so I sat down to smoke a council-pipe with myselfand the ash-tree over the matter. No sooner was the mind left to its ownunhampered way than it began to piece bits of a puzzle-picture deftly together;and when the picture was complete I knew exactly where I was, and where I mightquickly find a familiar trail. Eight years before, in an idle hour when nothingstirred on my pond, I had explored a mile or so beyond the bog to the south,only to find a swampy, desolate country without a trail or conspicuous landmarkof any kind. It was while I passed through this waste, seeking nothing inparticular and returning to my pond, that the mind took its snapshot of acertain tree, and preserved the picture so carefully, so minutely, that yearslater the original was instantly recognized. Many similar ash-trees grew on thatflat, each with its glossy crown and its gray shaft flecked by dark-green moss;what there was in this one to attract me, what outward grace or inwardtree-sprite, I have not yet found out.Another subconscious record seems to have been made for beauty alone, with itsconsequent pleasure, rather than for utility. As I watched my pond one summermorning, intent on learning what attracted so many deer to its shores, the mindapparently chose its own moment for making a perfect picture, a masterpiece,which should hang in its woodsy frame on my mental wall forever. The sky waswondrously clear, the water dancing, the air laden with the fragrance of peatand sweet-scented grass. Deer were slow in coming that morning, and meanwhilenothing of consequence stirred on my pond; but there was still abundantsatisfaction in the brilliant dragonflies that balanced on bending reeds, or inthe brood of wild ducks that came bobbing out like young mischief-makers from ahidden bogan, or even in the face of the pond itself, as it brightened under agleam of sunshine or frowned at a passing cloud or broke into a laugh at thetouch of a cat's paw wind. Suddenly all these pleasant minor matters werebrushed aside when a bush quivered and held still on the farther shore.All morning the bushes had been quivering, showing the silvery side of theirleaves to every breeze; but now their motion spoke of life, and spoke truly, forout from under the smitten bilberries came a bear to stand alert in the open.The fore part of his body was lifted up as he planted his paws on a tussock; hismassive head was thrust forward as he tried to penetrate the far distance withhis near-sighted eyes. He was not suspicious, not a bit; his nose held steady asa pointing dog's, instead of rocking up and down, as it does when a bear triesto steal a message from the air. A moment he poised there, a statue of ebonyagainst the crimson moss; then he leaped a bogan with surprising agility, andcame at his easy, shuffling gait around a bend of the shore. Opposite me he satdown to cock his nose at the sky, twisting his head as he followed the motion ofsomething above him, which I could not see,—a hornet, perhaps, or a troublesomefly that persisted in buzzing about his ears. Twice he struck quickly with apaw, apparently missing the lively thing overhead; for he jumped up, rushedahead violently and spun around on the pivot of his toes. Then he settledsoberly to his flat-footed shuffle once more, and disappeared in a clump oflarches, which seemed to open a door for him as he drew near.For me that little comedy was never repeated, though I saw many another on darkdays or bright; and the last time I visited my pond I beheld it sadly altered,its beauty vanished, its shores flooded, its green trees stark and dead. Unknownto me, however, the mind had made its photographic record, and always I see mypond, as on that perfect day, in its setting of misty-green larches and crimsonbog. Again its quiet face changes, like a human face at pleasant thoughts, andover it comes to me the odor of sweet-scented grass. The sunshine brightens it;the clouds shadow it; brilliant dragon-flies play among its bending reeds; thesame brood of ducklings glides in or out from bogan to grassy bogan; and foreverthe bear, big and glossy black, goes shuffling along the farther shore.image [images/9781591438984_016.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_043.jpg]XIIONE of the subtler charms of my pond, a thing felt rather than seen, was acertain air of secrecy which seldom left it. In every wilderness lake lurks amystery of some kind, which you cannot hope to penetrate,—a sense of measurelessyears, of primal far-off things, of uncouth creatures dead and gone that hauntedits banks before the infancy of man; but on this little pond, with its sunnywaters and open shore, the mystery was always pleasant, and at times provoking,as if it might be the place where an end of the rainbow rested.Though small enough to give one a sense of possession (one can never feel thathe owns a big lake, or anything else which gives an impression of grandeur orsublimity), my pond had a mischievous way of hinting, when you were mostcomfortable, that it was hiding a secret; that it might show you, if it would, amuch better scene than that you looked upon. It was shaped somewhat like animmense pair of spectacles, having two lobes that were flashing bright, with anarrow band of darker water between; and, what with its bending shores orintervening larches, you could never see the whole of it from anyone place. So,like eyes that hide their subtlest lights of whim or fancy under glasses, itoften seemed to be holding something in reserve, something which it would notreveal unless you searched for it. After watching awhile from one beautiful orrestful spot, you began to feel or imagine that some comedy was passing unseenon the other half of the pond; and though you resisted the feeling at first,sooner or later you crept through the screen of larches to know if it were true.On every side of the pond save one, where a bank of evergreen made velvetshadows intermingled with spots of heavenly blue, the shores were thickly spreadwith mosses, which began to color gloriously in midsummer, the colors deepeningas the season waned, till the reflecting water appeared as the glimmering centerof a gorgeous Oriental rug. Along the edges of this rug, as a ragged fringe,stood groups of larches in irregular order,—little fairylike larches that boretheir crown of leaves not as other trees bear them, heavily, but as a floatingmist or nebula of sage green. Like New England ladies of a past age they seemed,each wearing a precious lace shawl which gave an air of daintiness to theirsterling worth. When the time came for the leaves to fall, instead of rustlingdown to earth with a sound of winter, mournfully, they would scamper away on amerry wind, mingling their fragrance with that of the ripened grass; and thenthe twigs appeared plainly for the first time, with a little knot or twist inevery twig, like toil-worn fingers that the lace had concealed.Here or there amid this delicate new growth towered the ruin of a mightytamarack, or ship-knee larch, such as men sought in the old clipper-ship dayswhen they needed timbers lighter than oak, and even tougher to resist thepressure of the gale or the waves' buffeting. Once, before the shipmenpenetrated thus far into the wilderness, the tamaracks stood here in noblearray, their heads under clouds, beckoning hungry caribou to feed from thelichens that streamed from their broad arms above the drifted snow; now most ofthem are under the moss, which covered them tenderly when they fell. The fewremaining ones stand as watch-towers for the hawks and eagles; their brokenbranches make strange sepia drawings of dragon-knots and hooked beaks on theblue sky. A tiny moth killed all these great larches; the caribou movednorthward, leaving the country, and the deer moved in to take possession.This and many other stories of the past my little pond told me, as I watchedfrom its shores or followed the game-trails that were spread like a net aboutits edges. Back in the woods these trails wandered about in devious fashion,seeking good browse or easy traveling; while here or there a faint outgoingbranch offered to lead you, if your eyes were keen, to the distant ridge where abig buck had his daily loafing-place. On the bog the trails went morecircumspectly, uniting at certain places in a single deep path, a veritable pathof ages, which was the only path that might safely be followed by any creaturewith more weight than a fox. The moment you ventured away from it the groundbegan to shiver, to quake alarmingly, to sink down beneath your feet. Only athin mat of roots kept you afloat; the roots might anywhere part and drop youinto black bottomless ooze, and close forever over your head. A queer place, onemight think, for heavy beasts to gather, and so it was; but the oldcaribou-trails or new deer-paths offered everyone of them safe footing.At first these game-trails puzzled me completely, being so many and sopointless. That they were in constant use was evident from the footprints inthem, which were renewed almost every morning; yet I never once saw a deerapproach the water to drink or feed. Something else attracted them; a highwayfrom one feeding ground to another, it might be, or the wider outlook whichbrings deer and caribou out of their dim woods to sightly places; but there wasno certainty in the matter until the animals themselves revealed the secret. Oneday, when a young buck passed my hiding-place as if he were going somewhere, Ifollowed him to the upper or southern end of the pond. There he joined fourother deer, which were very busy about a certain spot, half hidden by lowbushes, a couple of hundred yards back from the shore. And there they stayed,apparently eating or drinking, for a full half-hour or more.When the deer were gone away, I went over and found a huge spring, to whichconverged a dozen deep trails. Like the hub of an immense wheel it seemed: theradiating paths were the spokes, and somewhere beyond the horizon was the unseenrim. From the depths of the spring came a surprising volume of clear,coffee-colored water, bubbling over joyously as it leaped from the dark earthinto the light, and then stealing quietly away under bending grasses to keep mypond brim full. Around the spring the earth was pitted by the feet of deer, andeverywhere about its edges were holes lapped in the peat by eager tongues. Here,beyond a doubt, was what called so many animals to my pond,—a mineral spring orsalt-lick, such as we read about in stories of pioneer days, when game waseverywhere abundant, but such as one now rarely finds.After that happy discovery I shifted my blind to another larch with low-droopingbranches, beneath which one might rest comfortably and look out through a screenof lace upon a gathering of the deer. They are creatures of habit as well as offreedom; and one of their habits is to rest at regular intervals, the hoursbeing hard to forecast, since they vary not only with the season of lengtheningor shortening days, but also each month with the changes of the moon. Thus, whenthe moon fulls and weather is clear, deer are abroad most of the night. At dawnthey seek their day-beds, instinctively removing far from where they have lefttheir scent in feeding; and during the day they are apt to remain hidden savefor one brief hour, when they take a comforting bite here or there, giving theimpression that they eat now from habit rather than from hunger. As the moonwanes they change their hours to take advantage of its shining; and on the \"darkof the moon\" they browse only in the early part of the night, then rest manyhours, and have two periods of feeding or roaming the next day.Such seems to be the rule in the North, with plenty of exceptions to keep oneguessing,—as in the November mating-season, when bucks are afoot at all hours;or during a severe storm, which keeps deer and all other wild animals close intheir coverts.Because of this regularity of habit at irregular hours, the only certainty aboutthe salt-lick was that the animals would come if one waited long enough. As Iwatched expectantly from my larch bower, the morning shadows might creep up tome, halt, and lengthen away on the other side, while not a deer showed himselfin the open. Then there would be a stir in the distant larches, a flash ofbright color; a doe would emerge from one of the game-trails, hastening herspringy steps as she neared the spring. As my eyes followed her, noting withpleasure her graceful poses, her unwearied alertness, her frequent turning ofthe head to one distant spot in the woods where she had left her fawn, therewould come another flash of color from another trail, then two or three in aflecking of light and shadow, till half a dozen or more deer were gathered atthe lick, some lapping the mud eagerly, others sipping, sipping, as if theycould never have enough of the water. After a time they would slip away as theyhad come, singly or in groups; the spring would be deserted, and one could nevertell how many hours or days might pass before another company began to gather.However eager for salt they might be, the deer came or went in that mysteriouslysilent way of theirs, appearing without warning in one trail, or vanishing downanother without a sound to mark their passing. Now and then, however, especiallyif one watched at the exquisite twilight hour, a very different entrance mightbe staged on the lonely bog,—a gay, prancing \"here I come: get out of the way\"kind of entrance, which made one glad he had stayed to witness it. On the slopeof the nearest ridge your eye would catch an abrupt motion, the upward surge ofa bough or the spring-back of a smitten bush; presently to your ears would comea rapid thudding of earth, or a sqush, sqush, sqush of water; the larches wouldburst open and a buck leap forth, flourishing broad antlers or kicking up madheels as he went gamboling down the game-trail. If other deer were at thespring, they would throw up their heads, set their ears at the dancing buck,take a last quick sip from the spring, and move aside as he jumped in to muzzlethe mud as if famished. For it was the mud rather than the water which firstclaimed his attention, no doubt because it held more of the magic salt. He oftengave the impression, as he approached in high feather, that he had been tastingthe stuff in anticipation and could hardly wait to get his tongue into it.The first time I saw that frisky performance I went over to taste the mud formyself, but found little to distinguish it from the mud of any other peat-bog.The water from the spring was wholesome, with a faint taste of something I couldnot name; and I drank it repeatedly without learning its secret. That it held acharm of some kind, which chemistry might reveal, was evident from the fact thatdeer came from miles around to enjoy its flavor. Some of the trails could betraced clear across the bog to distant ridges and a broken country beyond; andin following these trails, to learn what creatures used them and where they camefrom, I repeatedly came upon a deer asleep in his day-bed. Whether the animalscouched here before drinking at the spring, or after drinking, or \"just byhappentry\" I could not tell.Once the sleeper was a buck with noble antlers. He was resting beside a greatlog on the edge of an opening, half surrounded by dense fir thickets. I speak ofhim as asleep; but that is mere habit of speech or poverty of language. Of ascore of wild birds or beasts that I have found \"asleep\" in the woods, not oneseemed to lose touch with the waking world even for an instant. The buck'seyelids were blinking, his head nodding heavily; yet all the while his feet werecurled in readiness for an instant jump; and somehow those expressive feet gavethe impression of being as wide awake as a squirrel. Occasionally as I watchedhim, fascinated by the rare sight, his head would drop almost to the ground,only to be jerked up with an air of immense surprise; then the sleepy fellowwould stare in a filmy, unseeing, \"who said I was asleep\" kind of way at alittle tree that stood in the opening. The stare would end with a slow closingof the eyelids, and in a moment he would be nodding again.image [images/9781591438984_017.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_044.jpg]XIIINEXT to the deer, the wild ducks were the chief attraction of my pond. Indeed,they might well be placed first, since they were always at home there, and muchof the time engaged in one or another of the little comedies that make ducks themost amusing of all birds. Eight summers in succession, and again after aninterval of two years, I found my pond occupied by a pair of black mallards withtheir brood; and I fancied, since migratory birds return to the place of theirbirth, and their nestlings after them, that one of the pair was the linealdescendant of ducks that had held the place in undisputed possession for tens ofthousands of years. Here was a succession, modest like all true nobility, whichmade the proud family trees of Mayflower folk or English kings or Norman baronslook like young berry-bushes in the shade of a towering pine.Until late midsummer the family had the pond all to themselves. Never astranger-duck appeared to share or challenge their heritage; while day after daythe mother watched over the little brood as they fed or played or learned thewild duck signals. Like our dogs, every manner of beast or bird has its owntribal ways or customs, some of which do not appear in the young until theybegin to roam abroad or to mingle with their kind. So, as I watched the broodemerge from down to pin-feathers, there would come a red-letter day when two ofthem, meeting as they rounded a grassy point, would raise their wings as if insalutation; and a later day when, the pin-feathers having grown to fair plumage,their young cheepings or whistlings would change to a decided quack.Thereafter their talk was endlessly entertaining, if one took the trouble tocreep near enough to appreciate its modulations, expressive of every emotionbetween drowsiness and tense alarm; for it cannot be heard, except as ameaningless sound, beyond a few yards. The little hen-ducks got on famously,having the mother's quacking as a model; but male ducks cannot or will not learnto quack, and since a male voice was rarely heard on the pond at this season,each little drake was a law unto himself, and made a brave show of his liberty.Climbing on a tussock, as if for more room, he would stretch his wings, make oddmotions with his neck, and finally pump out a funny wheekle, wheekle, as if hehad swallowed a whistle.Meanwhile the old drake and father of the family was seldom about; only two orthree times did I see him enter the pond, stay a brief while, and then wing awayover the tree-tops in the direction of a larger lake, some three miles to theeastward. On that lake there was never a brood of young ducks, so far as I couldlearn; but when trout-fishing there I often surprised the drake, at times takingprecious care of his own skin in solitude, again clubbing sociably with three orfour other drakes, who had run away each from a family and the cares thereof onsome other lonely pond.As the summer waned, a new sound of quacking, joyous and exultant, would greetme when I drew near my pond. Creeping to my blind under the larches, I wouldfind a second brood making merry acquaintance with the family I had watchedover; then a third and a fourth company of strangers, as young ducks of all thatregion began to traffic about in preparation for the autumn flight. A littlelater the flocks fairly reveled in sociability, gathering here or there withincreasing numbers, till on a late-September day I might find my pond deserted,the owners being on a visit elsewhere, or I might catch breath at sight of somany ducks that I could not accurately count them or distinguish one brood fromanother.At such a time my little pond seemed to awaken, to shed its silence like agarment, to put on its most animated expression, as at a happy festival orfamily reunion. The air was never still from the gabble of meeting groups(probably all more or less related), or from the resounding quank, quank, quankof some old gossip who went about proclaiming her opinion to the whole company.Everywhere the still water was broken into undulating wakes as the drakes sweptgrandly over it, with that rhythmic, forward-and-back motion of their headswhich is like duck poetry,—a motion that is not seen when the birds are feeding,but only when they are well satisfied with themselves or their audience. Throughthe shadows under the bank glided knots or ribbons of young birds which had notyet quite satisfied their appetites, some exploring every crevice for ripenedseeds, others tip-tilting their tails to the blue sky as they probed the bottomfor water-bugs and other tit-bits. In an open space a solitary hen-duck bobbedand teetered ecstatically, dipping the fore part of her body under, then heavingit up quickly so as to send the cleansing water in a foamy wave over her backand wings. Here or there on a tussock stood a quiet group of the splendid birds,oiling their glossy feathers, setting a wing-cover just right, or adding someother last touch to an elaborate toilet before settling down for a nap.The glassy water reflected every form, color, motion of these untroubled ducksas in a glass, doubling the graceful effect. Around them stretched thegloriously colored bog; and beyond the bog were the nebulous-green larches, thesomber black growth and the lifting hills, on which autumn had laid its goldentouch. Truly a beautiful sight, a sight to make the heart of hunter ornaturalist tremble with expectancy as he fingered his gun. I have known thattrembling, that expectancy; but there was greater pleasure, perhaps greaterfreedom also, in leaving the happy comedy undisturbed.Because of its solitude, its utter wildness, my pond seemed to be the chosenresting-place of the flocks on an autumn day (they feed or travel mostly bynight), and perhaps for the same reason the ducks that frequented it were amongthe wildest creatures I have ever tried to stalk. A black mallard is not an easybird to outwit at any time or place; but here some magic mirror orsounding-board seemed to supplement his natural eyes or ears. The slightestunnatural voice or appearance, the snap of a twig or the quiver of a leaf or theglimpse of a face in the larches, would send a flock away on the instant; andsometimes, when I was sure no sound or motion of mine had broken the perfectquiet, they would take wing in such incomprehensible fashion as to leave mewondering what extra sense had warned them of danger.Several times in the course of a summer, when I wanted to observe the littleduck family more nearly, or to learn the meaning of some queer play that I couldnot understand from a distance, I would creep out of the larches unseen, wormingmy way along a sunken deer-path, and stopping whenever heads were turned in mydirection. One might think it an easy matter to approach any game by suchmethods; yet almost invariably, before I could be safe behind a bush or a tuftof grass at the water's edge, the old mother-duck would become uneasy, like adeer that catches a vague hint of you floating far down the wind. That she couldnot see or hear me was certain; that she could not smell me I had repeatedlyproved; nevertheless, after searching the shores narrowly she would stretch herneck straight up from the water, as if attentive to some wireless message in theair.A wild duck does not take that alert attitude unless she is suspicious; and acurious thing was, that though the mother was silent, uttering never a word, theyoung would crouch and remain motionless wherever they happened to be. Suddenly,as if certain of danger but unable to locate it, the mother would spring aloftto go sweeping in wide circles over the bog. She seemed to know it by heart,every pool and bump and shadow of it; and when her keen eyes picked up anunfamiliar shadow on a certain deer-path she would come at it with a rush,whirling over it in an upward-climbing spiral till she became sure of me, as ofsomething out of place, when she would speed away with a warning note over thetreetops. If the young were strong of wing, they would follow her swiftly,giving wide berth to the deer-path as if she had told them beware of it; but ifthey did not yet trust themselves in the air, they would skulk away, their headsdown close to the water, and hide in one of the grassy bogans of the pond, wherebecause of the quaking shore it was impossible to come near them.Once, when the mother left in this way, I waited till the ducklings had beensome minutes hidden before creeping back to my blind in the larches. An hour ormore passed in the timeless quiet; while the water became as glass under theafternoon sun, and a deer moved near the hidden brood without flushing them oreven bringing a head up where I could see it. Then the mother returned, callingas she came; and the first thing she did was to circle warily over the samedeerpath, stretching her neck down for a close inspection. \"Aha! that thing isgone, but where?\" she said in every line and motion of her inquisitive head orpulsating wings, as she sped away to find the answer.Twice she circled the bog, her eyes searching every cranny and shadow of it.From her high flight she slanted straight down and pitched fair in the middle ofthe pond, where for some moments she sat motionless, her head up, looking,listening,—a perfect image of alertness in the midst of wildness. Satisfied atlast that no trouble was near, she turned to the shore with a low call; and outof the bogan pell-mell rushed the little ones, splashing, cheeping, half liftingthemselves with their tiny wings as they scurried over the water to join themother. For a full hour I had kept my glasses almost continuously on that bogan;then with divided attention I cast expectant glances at it when I heard themother's incoming note, the whish of her wings as she circled the bog and thesplash as she took the water; but not till the right signal came did I see amotion or a sign of life from the hidden brood.The pond was shaped, as we have noticed, like a pair of spectacles; and afavorite place for the autumn flock to rest or preen or sleep was at the bendbetween the two lobes. Down into that bend ran a screen of alder-bushes, theonly good cover between woods and water on the entire pond; and it was so densethat a cat could hardly have crept through it without making a disturbance. Thatwas one reason, I suppose, why the ducks felt safe at the outer end of thetangle: they could see everything in front or on either side, and hear anythingthat moved behind them.One day, when the shore at this bend was freshly starred by ducks' feet andlittered with feathers, showing that a large flock had just left the roost, Ibegan at the fringe of larches and cut a passageway, a regular beaver's tunnel,down the whole length of the alder run, making an end in a point of grass, wherethe water came close on three sides. One had to consider only the birds' keenears, the alder screen being so thick that not even a duck's eye could penetrateit; therefore I smoothed the way most carefully, leaving no stick below to crackunder my weight, and no branch reaching down to rustle or quiver as I crawledbeneath it. When the tunnel was well finished I left the pond to its solitude afew days, thinking that the birds would surely notice some telltale sign of mywork, some fresh-cut stick or wilted bough that my eyes had overlooked, and bewary of the alders for a little time.And why such pains to get near a bird, you ask, since one might better observeor shoot him from a comfortable distance? Oh, just a notion of mine, an oddnotion, which can hardly be appreciated till one has proved it in the open. Asyou can seldom \"feel\" the quality of a stranger while he remains even a fewyards away, so with any wild bird or beast: there is an impression arising fromnearness, from contact, which cannot be had in any other way; and that swiftimpression, which is both physical and mental, a judgment as it were of theentire nature, is often more illuminating than hours of ordinary observation orspeculation.Such an impression is not new or strange, or even modernly psychological. On thecontrary, it is the simplest matter in the world of sense, I think, and perhapsalso the surest. Most animals have a significant way of touching their noses toone of their own kind at meeting; not to smell him, as we imagine (they cansmell him, or even his tracks, at a distance), but in order to receive a moreintimate or convincing message than the sense of smell can furnish. Likewise, aman naturally pats the head of a dog, or fingers an object after minutelyscanning it with his eyes; and in this instinctive action is the ancient touchof recognition. Touch is the oldest and most universal of the bodily senses,sight, smell, taste and hearing being later specializations thereof; by it theliving creature first became aware of a world outside of self; and to it we allreturn for verification of our sense impressions. Therefore it happens mostnaturally that, despite warning signs or penalties, thoughtless men will puttheir hands into the bear or monkey cage, where animals are no longer natural orto be trusted, and our children must be forever lectured, or sometimes spanked,for handling things which they have been told to let alone.Besides, when one is very near a strange bird or beast, one becomes vaguelyconscious of an extra sense at work,—that real but uncataloguedsense-of-presence (to coin a name for it) which makes two persons in a roomaware of each other at every instant, even while both are absorbed in quiet workor reading. The \"feel\" of the same room when one occupies it alone is verydifferent; and the difference may help to explain why gregarious animals areuncomfortable, uneasy, unless they are near their own kind,—near enough, thatis, not simply to hear or see them but to feel their bodily presence. Aherd-animal is always restless, and often sickens, if his herd is not closeabout him. The same mysterious sense (mysterious to us, because we do not yetknow the organ through which it works) often warns the solitary man in the woodsor in the darkness that some living creature is near him, at a moment when hiseyes or ears are powerless to verify his impression.But that is another and more subtle matter, familiar enough to a few sensitivepersons and natural woodsmen, but impossible of demonstration to others; youcannot explain color to a man born blind. The simple answer is, that for my ownsatisfaction I wanted to touch one of the wary birds of my pond, as I had beforetouched eagle and crow, bear and deer, and many another wild creature in hisnative woods. Such was the notion. In other places I had several times tried toindulge it; but save in one instance, when I found a winter flock weakened byhunger, I had never laid my hand fairly on a black mallard when he had the freeuse of his wits and wings.When I returned to my pond, and from a distance swept my glasses over it, thewater was alive with ducks; never before had I seen so many there at one time.Single large birds, the drakes undoubtedly, were moving leisurely over the openspaces. Groups of five or six, each a brood from some neighboring pond, weregliding in an exploring kind of way under the banks or through the weed-beds;and scattered along the shore at the end of the alder run were wisps orcompanies of the birds, all preening or dozing with an air of complete security.Here at last was my chance, my perfect chance, I told myself, as I carefullymarked one brood standing at the tip of the grassy point where my tunnel ended.More carefully than ever I stalked a bear, I circled through the black growth,crept under the fringe of larches, and entered the alder run unobserved. Inch byinch I wormed along the secret passageway, flat to the ground, not once raisingmy head, hardly daring to pull a full breath, till, just as I emerged from thealder shade into the grass, a gamy scent in my nose and a low gabble in my earstold me that I was almost near enough, that the birds were all around me, andthat for the rest of the way I must move as a shadow.From under my hat-brim I located the gabblers, a large family of black mallardsoutside the fringe of grass on my left. They were abreast of me, not more thanfive or six feet away. I had not marked these birds when I began my stalk; theywere hidden in a tiny cove or bend of the shore, and had it not been for theirvoices I would surely have crept past without seeing them. At the mouth of thecove was a single tussock, on which stood the mother-duck, wavering betweendreams and watchfulness as the sunshine poured full upon her, making her verysleepy. On the bare earth beneath her the others were getting ready for a nap,so near that I could see every motion, the settling of a head, the blink of aneyelid. Occasionally through the tangle of grass stems came the penetratinggleam of their eyes,—marvelously bright eyes, alert and intelligent.For several minutes I held motionless, still flat to the ground, listening tothe sleepy talk, admiring the mottled-brown plumage of a breast or the bar ofbrilliant color drawn athwart a sooty wing. All the while my nose was trying toget in a warning word, telling me to give heed that the ducky odor which flowedin waves over the whole point was different from this strong reek, as of adisturbed nest, in the near-by grass; but my eyes were so occupied that I paidno attention to other senses. As the duck on the tussock at last settled down tosleep and I worked my toes into the earth for a noiseless push forward, therewas a slight but startling motion almost at my shoulder. A neck was raised andtwisted sleepily, as if to get the kink out of it; and the thrill of success ranover me as I made out another and nearer group of ducks. They were under thebank and the bending grass, where I had completely overlooked them. Everyone waswithin reach; and everyone I could see had his head drawn in or tucked awayunder his wing.Slowly my left hand stole toward them, creeping forward in the deliberatefashion of a measuring worm, first the fingers stretched, then the knucklesraised, then out with the fingers again. It would have been very easy to strokeor to catch one of the birds by a swift motion; but that was not what I wanted,and would have instantly spoiled the whole comedy. For the right effect, thehand must rest upon a duck before he was aware of it, so quietly that at firsthe would give his attention to the hand itself, not to the thing it came from.Then he would probably give it a questioning peck, examine it curiously, andfinally grow indifferent to it, as other birds had done when I touched them fromhiding. But here my head was too close to the ground, and my body too crampedfor easy action. As my hand reached the edge of the bank, just over anunconscious duck, it ran into a tuft of saw-grass, which cut my fingers andrustled dangerously. To clear this obstruction I drew back slightly, lifted up agrain; and in my other ear, which was turned away, a resonant voice cried Quock!with a challenge that broke the tension like a pistol-shot.Involuntarily I turned my head, just when I should have held most still; and soI lost my chance. There, at arm's-length on the other side of the point, awild-eyed duck was looking over the bank, her neck stretched like a taut string,her olive-colored bill pointing straight at me. She never said another word, andhad no need to repeat her challenge. All over the point and along the shorenecks were stretched up from the grass; a dozen alert forms rose like sentinelsfrom as many tussocks, and forty pairs of keen eyes were everyone searching thespot at which the old hen-duck pointed her accusation.For a small moment that tableau lasted, without a sound, without a motion; whileone was conscious only of the tense necks, the pointing bills, the gleaminglittle eyes, each with its diamond-point of light; and then the old duck tookwing. She did not even crouch to jump, so far as I could follow her motion; shesimply went into the air like a rocket, shooting aloft as if hurled from aspring. As she rose, there was an answering rush of wings, whoosh! in my veryears, a surge as of smitten water in the distance; and in the same fraction ofan instant every duck to the farthest ends of the pond was up and away in a wildtumult of quacking.Only one of these birds had seen me, and that one probably had no notion of whatshe had glimpsed in the grass. It was a round thing with eyes, and it moved asecond time—that was enough for the old hen-duck, and the others did not stop toask any questions.image [images/9781591438984_018.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_045.jpg]XIVTWO full years passed before I returned to my pond on a sunny September day, inmy mind's eye seeing it smile a welcome, hearing it cry, \"Lo here! Lo there!\"and planning, as I came down the silent trail, how I would accept all itsinvitations. First, the salt-lick must be spied out from a distance; and theexamination would tell me whether to keep on down my own trail or, if the lickwere occupied, to branch off by a certain game-path, which would lead me to theblind where I had so often watched the deer unseen. Next, I would have a restfullook at a mound of moss swelling above the bog near a certain tamarack, whichalways showed the first blush of crimson in midsummer, and which became inautumn like a gorgeous bed of Dutch tulips, only more wondrously colored. Then Iwould look into the doorway under the larches, where my bear had disappeared. Ialways picked that out from a hundred similar doorways to watch or question it amoment, as if at any time the green curtain might open to let the bear out. Fora curious thing about all woodsmen is this: if they see a buck or a bear or evena fox enter a certain place, they must forever afterward stop to have anotherexpectant look at it.From the bear's doorway my thoughts turned naturally to a little bogan of mypond, which was different from all the other bogans, because once a family ofminks darted out of it and came dodging along the shore in my direction. LuckilyI was close to the water at that moment. While the minks were out of sight undersome bushes, I swung my feet over the bank and sat down in their path to waitfor them.In advance came the mother, looking rusty in her sunburnt summer coat, and shewas evidently in a great hurry about something. The little ones, trailing outbehind, were hard put to it to keep up the pace. She was fairly under me beforeshe noticed a new scent in the air, which made her halt to look about for themeaning of it. Her neck was lifted, weasel-fashion, to thrice its ordinarylength; at the end of it her pointed head swung like a vane to the bank, to thepond, to the bank again; while her busy nose wiggled out its sharp questions.Probably she had no notion of man, never having met the creature; neither didshe associate the motionless figure above her with life or danger. She passeddirectly over one of my shoes, halted with her paws raised against the other,and scampered on as if she had no use for such trifles.Before the little ones arrived I half turned to meet them, spreading my feet soas to leave a narrow passageway between the heels; and over this, as a cover,rested my hand, making a shadowy runway such as minks like. When the kitsentered it, sleek and glossy and half grown, I touched them lightly on the neck,feeling the soft brush of fur and the ripple of elastic muscles as one afteranother glided under my finger, with no more concern than if it had been one ofthe roots among which they were accustomed to creep. But when the last one cameI blocked the runway by placing a hand squarely across it, stopping him short ingreat astonishment. He sniffed at the obstruction, and his nose was like a pointof ice as it wandered over my palm. Then he tried a finger with his teeth,wriggled under it to follow his leader, and the whole family disappeared in atwisting, snakelike procession around the next bend. These were wild animals,remember; and ounce for ounce there is no more \"savage\" beast in the woods thanCheokhes the mink.As with birds or beasts, so also with the trees about my pond: somehow theyseemed different from all other trees, perhaps because of more intimateassociation; for though all the cedars or hemlocks of a forest look alike to astranger, no sooner do you spend days alone among them than you begin to have acurious feeling of individuality, of comradeship, of understanding even, as ifthey were not wholly dumb or insensate. It was inevitable, therefore, as I camedown the trail, recalling this or that tree under which I had often passed orrested, that certain of them stood forth in memory as having given me pleasureor greeting in the lonely woods, just as certain faces emerge from the sea offaces in a crowd or a great audience of strangers, and instantly make one feelhis kinship to humanity.Foremost among these memorable trees was a great white-pine, to me the noblestof all forest growths, which stood on a knoll to westward of my pond, on the wayto camp, and which always seemed to cry hail or farewell as I came or went. Ithad a stem to make one wonder, almost to make one reverent. Massive,soft-colored, finely reticulated it was; wide as the span of a man's arms, andrising near a hundred feet without knot or branch,—a glorious upspringing shaft,immensely strong, yet delicate in its poise as a lance in rest. From the top ofthe shaft rugged arms were stretched out above the tallest trees, and on theserested lightly as a cloud its crown of green. Like others that overtop theirfellows, the old pine had paid the penalty of greatness. Whirlwinds that leftlower trees untouched had stripped it of half its branches; lightning had leapedupon it from the clouds, leaving a spiral scar from crown to foot; but the woundwhich threatened its death was meanwhile its life, because the lumbermen, seeingthe lightning's mark, had passed on and left the pine in its solitary grandeur.When I first saw that tree I changed the trail so as to pass beneath it; andthereafter it was like a living presence, benign and friendly, beside the way.To lay a hand on its mighty stem, as one passed eastward in the early morning,was to receive an impression of renewed power,—a power which the scornful mightattribute to imagination, the chemist to electrons or radio-activity, and thesimple man to his Mother Nature. At evening, as one followed the dim trailhomeward in the fading light, one had only to look up for a guiding sign; andthere, solemn and still against the twilight splendor, was the crown of the oldpine to give direction. Its very silence at such an hour was like the Angelusringing. To halt beneath it, as one often did unconsciously, was to feel thespell of its age, its serenity, its peace; while harmonious thoughts came orwent attuned to the low melody of the winds, crooning their vesper song far upamong its green leaves. And, morning or midday or evening, to look up at thepine's lofty crown, which had tossed in the free winds that bore Pilgrim andPuritan westward with their immortal dream of freedom, was to be bound withstronger ties of loyalty to the fathers of my native state,—men of vision andimagination as well as of stern courage, who heard the pine booming out itspsalm to the gale and instantly adopted it as their new symbol, stamping it ontheir coins or emblazoning it on their banners as an emblem of liberty. Neveranother symbol, whether dragon or eagle or lion, had so much majesty, or was soworthy of free men. The remembrance of it in any national crisis or call to dutysets the American heart beating to the rhythm of Whittier's \"Pine-Tree\":Lift again the stately emblem on the Bay State's rusted shield,Give to northern winds the Pine-Tree on our banner's tattered field.Sons of men who sat in council with their Bibles round the board,Answering England's royal missive with a firm \"Thus saith the Lord,\"Rise again for home and freedom! set the battle in array!What the fathers did of old time we their sons must do to-day.Very different from the majestic pine was a little larch-tree, under which Ioften sat while watching the deer. As I came down the trail, after a year'sabsence, it would seem to lift its head and step forth from all the otherlarches, calling out cheerily: \"Welcome once more! And why so long away? See,here is your old place waiting.\" And drawing aside the delicate branches, Iwould find the seat of dry moss and springy boughs, the back-rest, the openwindow with its drapery of lace,—everything just as I had left it.Near this sociable young larch stood its dead ancestor, grim and silent, whichthe moths had killed; and this, too, seemed different from all other treesliving or dead. On sunny days it threw a straight shaft of shadow over my blind;and the shadow moved along the ground from west to east, telling the creepinghours like a sundial. At the tip of the lofty stub a short branch thrust itselfout at a right angle, and this served as the finger of my strange timepiece.When it rested on a bed of brimming pitcher-plants it pointed to the lunch in mypocket; when it touched the root of a water-maple it spoke of the home trail;and between, at irregular intervals, were a nanny-bush, a tuft of wild cottonand a shy orchid to mark the less important hours. Once, when I glanced at theslow-moving shadow, it was topped by a striking symbolic figure, and looking upquickly I found an eagle perched on the outstretched finger of my dial. Afterthat the old tamarack had a new dignity in my eyes; it stood on an eagle's lineof flight, one of his regular ways in crossing from mountain to lake, and fromit the kingly-looking bird was wont to survey this part of his silent domain,the sun gleaming on his snow-white crest.A stone's-throw behind my larch blind was a portly young fir, which I couldnever pass without a smile as it nodded to remind me that it was not like otherfirs. Thousands of these trees, crowding the northern forest, seem to be allgrown on the same model, like peas in a pod; but this one had a character and ahistory to set it forever apart from its kind. And this is the tale which alwayspassed silently between us when we met:One day, as I watched some deer at the salt-lick, they suddenly became uneasy,looking and harking about as if for danger, and then vanished down the severalgame-trails. Not till they were gone did I notice that the air was ominouslystill, or understand the cause of the alarm: a tempest was coming, and thesensitive animals were away to cover before my dull senses had picked up thefirst warning sign. Soon the landscape darkened; the face of my pond became as Ihad never seen it before; thunder growled in the distance; coppery clouds withlight flaming through them came rolling over the tree-tops; and all nature said,as plainly as a fire-bell, \"Get to cover, and quickly!\"As I went back into the woods, seeking shelter, a few big drops hit the leaveslike flails; then came a pause, still as death, and then the deluge. Ahead inthe gloom I spied a young fir (never pick a tall tree, or a solitary tree, in atempest of lightning) which thrust out a mass of feathery branches from athicket of its fellows. \"This for mine,\" I said as I dived under it, accompaniedby a blinding flare of light and an ear-splitting crack—and almost ran againstthe heels of a buck that jumped out on the other side. By an odd chance, one inten thousand, he had picked the same fir for shelter, and was no doubt thinkinghe had picked well when I came blundering in with the thunderbolt and drove himout into the downpour. \"Hold on, old sport! Come back; it's your tree,\" I calledafter him, feeling as if I had stolen a child's umbrella; but he paid noattention.Thinking he would not go far, and knowing he could hear or smell nothing in thatrush of rain and crashing of thunder, I crept slowly after him. There he was,hunched up in the lee of a big hemlock, ears drooping, legs streaming, andlittle spurts of mist popping up from his pelted hide. Though woebegone enough,he had not forgotten caution; oh no! trust an old buck for that in any weather.His tail was to the tree, his head turned warily to the trail over which he hadcome. And there I left him, wishing as I turned back that he would let me standunder his hemlock, or else come and share my fir, just for a little company.Near the lower end of my pond was still another tree which I must revisit; yes,surely, not only for its happy memories, but also in anticipation of some merrysurprise, of which it seemed to have endless store. It stood on a bankoverlooking a sunny deli in the woods, a wonderfully pleasant place where nowind entered, where the air was always fragrant, and a runlet of cool water sanga little tune to itself all day long. Its gnarled trunk was scarcely more than ashell, which boomed like a drum when a woodpecker sounded it; and above werehollow limbs with knot-hole entrances, offering hospitality to any wild creaturein search of a weatherproof den or nesting-place.The first time I passed this old tree a family of red squirrels were layingclaim to it in a tiff with some larger beast or bird, which slipped away as Iapproached. The next time I saw it, a year later, it was silent and apparentlydeserted; but as I rose from drinking at the runlet the head of a little grayowl appeared at a knot-hole. For full ten minutes he remained there motionless,without word or sign or even a blink to say that he was watching me, though itwas undoubtedly some noise or stir of mine which brought him up to his window.After that I fell in the way of turning aside to loaf awhile under the inn-tree;and rarely could one loaf there very long without overhearing something notintended for a stranger's ear, some low dialogue or hammering signal or petulantwhining or cautious scratching, to remind one of the running comedy of thewoods. It was evidently an exchange, a crossroad or meeting-place for the woodfolk, calling in every passer-by as a certain store or corner of a sleepy towninvites all idlers, boys and stray dogs, while other stores or corners areempty, save for women folk, and quite respectable.Once in the late morning, as I sat with an ear to the resonant shell, listeningto the talk of unseen creatures which I fancied were young 'coons, a biglog-cock flashed into the old tree, drew himself up on a stub over my head, andseemed to cock his ear at the voices to which I had been listening.Now the log-cock is naturally a wary bird, shy and difficult of approach; butthis gorgeous fellow with the scarlet crest became almost sociable in hiscuriosity, perhaps because the place was so quiet, so friendly, with no motionor hint of danger to disturb its tranquillity. He saw me at once, as the changein his bright eye plainly said; but, deceived by my stillness or the sobercoloring of my clothes, he set me down as a tree-fungus or mushroom that hadgrown since his last visit, and looked about for something more interesting.When I called his attention by a curt nod, telling him that this was no dullmushroom, he came down at once to light against the side of the tree, where heexamined my head minutely. Learning nothing from my wink, he went around thetree in a series of side-jumps to have a look from the other side; then hehopped up and down, this side or that, all the while uttering a low surprisedchatter. Even when I began to flip bits of wood at him (for he soon grewimpatient, and interrupted the 'coon talk by an unseemly rapping), instead ofrushing off in alarm, he twice followed a missile that rattled near him, as ifto demand, \"Well, what in the world sent you flying?\" Presently he sent forth acall, not the loud, high, prolonged note which you hear from him at a distance,but a soft, wheedling ah-koo! ah-koo! only twice repeated. When his call wasanswered in a different strain, a questioning strain it seemed to me, he dartedaway and returned within the minute accompanied by another log-cock.But enough of such pictures! They flash joyously upon the mental vision wheneverone recalls a cherished spot in the woods, but fade quickly if one attempts tohold or describe them, saying as they vanish that the lure of solitary lakes,the companionship of trees, the fascination of wild creatures that hide and lookforth with roundly curious eyes at a stranger's approach,—these are matters thatcan never be set down in words: the best always escapes in the telling. I meantonly to say (when my pine lifted its crown in the light of an evening sky, andthen the mink family came dodging along the shore of memory, and the buck andthe log-cock interrupted to urge me be sure and tell the happiest part of thestory before I made an end) that many pleasant memories greeted me as I camedown the silent trail after a long absence. In the distance sounded a lustyquacking; my imagination painted the mallards at the end of the alder run, withsunshiny water and crimson bog and misty-green larches around them, as a framefor the picture; and then the whole beautiful anticipation came tumbling in ruinabout my ears.Before I reached my pond, before I saw the welcoming gleam of it even, I was atevery step going over my shoetops in water, where formerly I had always founddry footing. Something disastrous had happened in my absence; the whole bog wasoverflowed; around it was no mist of delicate foliage but only skeleton trees,stark and pitiful. In my heart I was berating the lumbermen, whose ugly worksare the ruination of every place they visit, when at last I waded to an openingthat gave outlook on my pond; and the first thing I noticed, as my eyes sweptthe familiar scene, was a beaver-house cocked up on the shore, like a warningsign of new ownership.It is true that blessings brighten as they take their flight: not till I readthat crude sign of dispossession did I know how much pleasure my little pond hadgiven me. The lonely beauty which could quiet a man like a psalm, or like anIndian's wordless prayer; the glimpses of wild creatures at home and unafraid;the succession of radiant pictures, at sunny midday, or beneath the hushedtwilight, or in the expectant morning before the shadows come,—all these hadsuddenly taken wing, driven away by mud-grubbing animals with a notion in theirdull heads that they wanted deeper water about the site they had chosen fortheir house of sticks. It was too bad, too hopeless! I might have prevented theruin had I known; but now it was beyond all remedy. With a different interest,therefore, and still resentful that my pond was spoiled as thoroughly as anylumberman would have spoiled it, I made my way around the flood to examine thebeavers' work at the outlet.image [images/9781591438984_019.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/9781591438984_046.jpg]XVHIDDEN among the larches at the lower end of my pond was a tiny outgoing stream,which had proved hard to find when first I explored the region, and almostimpossible to follow afterward. Under a fallen log, so weathered and mossy thatit seemed part of the natural shore, a volume of water escaped without ripple ormurmur, wandering away under bending grasses to lose itself in an alder swamp,where innumerable channels offered it lingering passage. From the swamp it foundits way, creepingly, among brooding cedars to a little brook, which went singingfar down through the woods to Upper Pine Pond; and beyond that on the fartherside was a long dead-water, and then Pine Stream making its tortuous way throughan untraveled region to the Penobscot. The nearest beavers, a colony of fourlodges which I unearthed on a hidden branch of Pine Stream, were twelve orfifteen miles away, as the water flowed; yet over all that distance an exploringfamily had made its lonely way, guided at every turn by the flavor of distantsprings, till one after another they crept under the fallen log and entered mypond, which was solitary enough to satisfy even their pioneer instincts. Theyhad first picked a site for their new lodge, on a point overlooking the lowerhalf of the pond, and had then gone back to the outlet to raise the water.Their dam was a rare piece of wild engineering; so much I had to confess, evenwhile I wished that the beavers had chosen some other place to display theircraft. Finding where the water escaped, they stopped the opening beneath thelog, and made a bank of mud and alder-brush above it. This bank was carried outa dozen feet or more on either side of the stream, the ends being bent forward(toward the pond above) so as to make a very fine concave arch. On a small orquiet stream like this, beavers almost invariably build a straight dam; andwhere swift water calls for a stronger or curving structure, they present theconvex side to the current; but here they had reversed both rules, for somereason or impulse which I could not fathom,—except on the improbable assumptionthat the animals could foresee the end of their work from the beginning. Thefinished dam was an amazingly good one, as you shall see; but whether itresulted from planning or happy experiment or just following the water, only acertain old beaver could tell.Since there was no other outlet to my pond, the beavers were obliged to buildhere; but the site was a poor one, the land being uniformly low on all sides,and no sooner did they finish their dam than the rising water flowed around bothends of it. To remedy this they pushed out a curving wing from either end oftheir first arch, so that the line of their dam was now a pretty triple-curve.Again and again the outgoing water crept around the obstacle; each time thebeavers added other curving wings, now on this side, now on that, bending themsteadily forward till the top of their dam suggested the rim of an enormousscallop-shell. Then, finding the water deep enough for their needs, they thrustout a straight wing from either end of their dam, resting their work on theslopes of two hillocks in the woods, some fifty yards apart,—this in a straightline, or across the hinge of the scallop-shell: if measured on the curves, theirdam was three or four times that length. Their next task was to build a lodge onthe point above; then they dug a canal through the bog to the nearest grove ofhardwood, and cut down a liberal part of the trees for their winter supply ofbark. The branches of these trees had been cut into convenient lengths, floatedthrough the canal, and stored in a great food-pile in the deep water near thelodge.When I found the dam, several deer (to judge from the tracks) were already usingthe top of it as a runway in passing from the flooded ground on one side of thepond to the other. From either end a game-trail led upward along the shore, nolonger following immemorial paths over the bog, which was submerged with all itssplendor of color, but making a new and rougher way through the black growth.When I followed one of these trails it led me completely around the pond, goingconfidently till it neared the salt-lick, where it halted, wavered and trickledout in aimless wanderings. There, where once the ground was trodden smooth bymany feet, was now no ground to be seen. The precious spring, over which athousand generations of deer had lingered, had vanished in a dull waste ofwater. Twice I watched the place from early morning till owls began to cry thetwilight; in that time only a few animals appeared, singly, at long intervals;and after wandering about as if seeking something and finding it not, theydisappeared in the dusky woods.And so I went away, looking for the last time sadly on the little pond, as upona place one has owned and loved, but which has passed into other hands. Thoughthe wild ducks still breed or gather there, it is no longer the same. There isno restful spot from which to watch the waters dance with the wind, or frown atthe cloud, or smile at the sunshine; the little larches are all dead besidetheir ancestors; the carpet of colored moss is but a memory. When the beavers goto pioneer a remoter spot, I shall break their dam and let the water return toits ancient level. Then, if happily I live long enough for another fringe oflarches to grow, and another mossy rug to crimson under the waning sun, perhapsit will be my pond once more.image [images/9781591438984_020.jpg]THE END"},{"pageContent":"Footnotes*1.

Formerly they fed on the abundant game and were whollynatural animals; but their habits have changed with a changed environment. Whenthe game was destroyed by settlers or hunters the wolves began to feed ondomestic animals; and the descendants of these wolves, which killed right andleft in a crowding, excited herd of sheep or cattle, are now said to kill deerwantonly when they have the chance. I cannot personally verify the saying, andknow not whether it rests on exceptional or typical observation. In the North,where there are no domestic animals, I have rarely known a timber-wolf to killafter his hunger was satisfied."},{"pageContent":"About the AuthorWilliam J.
